HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C.(65) 15112th November, 1965COPY NO.   ^CABINETHOUSING PROGRAMMES 1965-70; DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by tha Secretary of State for Wales andthe Minister of Housing; and Local government we seek the cabinet approval to early presentation of a white paper in the terms of the draft circulated herewith.2.       The White Paper is intended to serve two main purposes:-(i)  to set out the measure of agreement reached in the discussions the Minister of Housing has had over the past several monthswith representatives of the builders and the building societies,local authorities and insurance companies about arrangements to use the level of mortgage advances as a means ofregulating the volume cf private house-building;  and(ii)  to explain and put in perspective the Government&apos;3 decisionto increase the amount of subsidy on housing provided by public authorities.3.      We hope that it will be possible to present the Paper during theweek beginning 22nd November.     The date of presentation will determinecommencement of the new subsidies, to be provided for in the Bill v/ehope to introduce early in December;  and as some authorities appear tobe holding up submission of housing proposals the sooner the white paper can be issued the better.4,       Since the draft paper was prepared we have thought it advisable to include some more specific reference to Wales.    We suggestinsertion of the annexed additional paragraph after paragraph 7.5.      The Secretary of State is proposing a separate White Paper forScotland.J.G.H. S.

8.      In Wales despite the fact that houses are being completed inrecord numbers at the present time there is still a veryconsiderable housing problem - in the larger towns, in the olderindustrial areas, and in rural areas.    The immediate problem ofthe shortage of dwellings, the replacement of unfit dwellings andthe provision of dwellings for the growing number of families andto encourage industrial mobility must be tackled with even greatervigour than has been shown in recent years because the 1970&apos;swill bring Wales face to face with the big and difficult task of replacing unfit houses in very large numbers.    Table 17. 2 in theNational Plan^^ shows that the percentage of dwellings over80 years old is higher in Wales than in Scotland or in any region inEngland.    Whilst some of these dwellings are capable of improve-ment to bring them up to modern standards there can be little doubt that the bulk of them will have to be replaced.    This points to an urgent need to increase still further the annual housing programme in Wales, and this will be done in line with the increaseplanned for England and Wales as a whole.The National Plan (Cmnd, 2764) Chapter 17.CONFIDENTIAL \

DRAFT WHITE PAPER - STHE HOUSING PROGRAMME 1965 to 1970THE OBJECTIVESHalf a million Louses a year(1)&apos;1.     As was announced in the National Plan v       the government intend to give a greater priority to housing than it has had formany years.    The rate of building will be pushed up as fast asresources and improving techniques allow.    In 196k, 383*000houses were completed (United Kingdom).    The first objective isto reach half a million houses a year by 1970,    Even that,however, will not be enough; partly because of the accumulatedpressure of bad and insufficient housing; partly because asstandards of living rise, families will demand and be preparedto pay for more space and better housing.   The 1970s should seestill bigger programmes,,2.     By comparison with the performance of other western european countries, a programme of half a million houses a year(2)within 5 years is modest^ There are always difficulties inmaking such comparisons - quality of building and standards of space come into the reckoning as well as numbers.   Needs, too,vary in both extent and kind from one country to another.However, the number of new dwellings built annually per1,000 population does give some broad basis for comparison.On this basis, the U.K. record has in recent years been almost the worst.    Sweden and West Germany in 1961-63 both, built morethan half as many houses again as the U.K. in relation topopulation.   The evidence suggests that the most successfulhousebuilding countries lead the U.K, at least partly becausethey have chosen to devote a greater proportion of their national resources and of their capital investment to housing,(1) The National Plan (Cmnd, 276*0 Chapter 17.(2) See Appendix k,S

3,     A target of half a million houses a year is also modest inthe light of the housing needs.     In Great Britain some 3 millionfamilies still live either in slums, in near slums or in grossly-overcrowded conditions.     At present information about needs is inadequate;    and of course they differ in different parts of the(a )country.    Information is being improvedv  &apos;.    Broadly, however, the requirement for new houses over the next few years can besummarised as follows:-needs existing now(i)   about 1 million to replace unfit houses alreadyidentified as slums;(ii)   up to 2 million more to replace old houses not yetslums but not worth improving;(iii)   about 700,000 to overcome shortages and provide a margin for mobility,needs arising annually(iv)   30,000 a year to replace the loss caused bydemolition - road widening and other forms ofredevelopment;    and(v)    150,000 a year to keep up with new householdsbeing formed in the rising population.k.     These broad estimates are based on the housingstandards applied in recent years.    Housing standards will riseas standards of living rise, and the estimates representminimum requirements.   Z;ven so, they show that getting on forh million houses are required now to replace slums and near slumsand to meet shortages.    In addition there is a continuing needfor some 180,000 new houses each year just to keep up with the growing number of households and losses from demolition.5.     In order to reach the half million figure there must be acommon plan to which all concerned with housebuilding oan work.Such a programme is large both in relation to the existingcapacity of the housebuilding industry and by oomparison withpast performance.    Housing, which occupies over U0;. of the

labour force in the construction industries (some two-thirds in new housebuilding) is the biggest single element in the demand on those industries; and it is, of course, in direct competitionv/ith numbers of other building programmes which are of greateconomic and social importance.    In the last four years, theannual rate of housebuilding in the United Kingdom has risenvery steeply - from 303,000 in 1961 to 383,000 in 196I+.    this increase was not achieved without considerable overheating ofthe construction industries and the consequent slowing down ofcompletions owing to shortages of labour and materials.    Afurther big increase by 1970 - from under 1+00,000 to 500,000 -will be a formidable undertaking.    It is plain that growth atthis rate can only be steady and continuous if the Governmentlays down a clear system of priorities and bases a plan ofaction on them.    This plan must take account both of thevariety of differing needs, in differing regions, and of theavailable resources; and if it is to succeed it must command the confidence of all concerned in housebuilding - especially the construction industries, the building societies and otherfinance agencies, and the local authorities.Regional implications6.     The circumstances of housing in Scotland differ in a numberof ways from those in England and lfales, and this affects thenature of the Government action required.    The remainder of this paper is concerned with England and vales (as are all thefigures, unless otherwise stated); the programme for scotland is the subject of a separate paper which is being presented(1 )concurrently by the Secretary of Statev1*     Housing conditions are much worse and the need for additionalhousing more acute in some parts of England and Wales than in(2)othersv  ;.    It will be the Government&apos;s aim to increase thebuilding programme fastest in the regions where housing needs aregreatest - where existing housing is exceptionally bad or(&apos;1) Reference(2) See National Plan:    p.173 and Table 17.2

programme, would be a reasonable division between the public and theprivate sectors, having regard to the social needs.10.    There is a large and increasing demand for more houses for owner-occupation.    In 1951, about 3,800,000 out of 12,390,000 dwellings wereowner-occupied - 31% of the total.    By the end of 196h the proportionhad risen to Ul% - 7,200,000 out of 15,370,000.    Part of this increaseresulted from the growing number of new houses built for sale each year;the annual rate rose from 21,000 in 1951 to 210,000 in 1961;, and duringthe Ik years 1,700,000 houses were built privately.    Part was due toa turnover of existing rented houses to owner-occupation.    Since the rent Act of 1957 a million houses have fallen out of private renting,often sold either to sitting tenants or to young couples in search ofa house.    This active demand for home ownership shows no sign of abating,and the housing plan must meet it.    Indeed it must go further,  and take account of what is probably an even larger suppressed demand for owner-occupation among the many families who cannot quite afford a mortgageon present terms.11.    While the Government must provide for a steady growth of building for owner-occupation,  it would be criminal, at the present time, notto allow for an even faster growth of building to let.    Shortage fallsheaviest on those least able to pay a high price for their homes.    the families in the really bad housing conditions - in the slums,  over-crowded, in multi-occupation - are,  in general, families who can onlyafford to rent,  and who in most cases can not afford to pay an economicrent.    The growing number of separate households also presses hard on whairented housing there is; for many young couples and for many old peopleowner-occupation is not possible.    In particular,  the conditions of housing in big cities make the provision of a large pool of houses to letat rents below the profitable level an urgent social necessity.The Milner Holland Committee which reviewed the London Housing situation( 1 )v  ^Report of the Committee on Housing in Greater London(Cmnd. 2605) p. 227.

&quot;There is an acute shortage of rented, housing inLondon and many difficulties and hardships arise from it*   The number of households whose housing conditionscause hardship is substantial, and greatest in inner london;    and we have identified certain areas where,contrary to the general improvement in conditions,hardship is severe and increasing.    The people mostaffected are those with low incomes who have neithera controlled nor a council tenancy - families with several children, newcomers to London, and a smallerbut growing number of elderly people.1112.   The experience of recent years has clearly demonstrated thatthe shortage of rented accommodation will not be overcome by a revival of private landlordism.    In 1957? immediately before the rent Act, the number of privately rented houses numbered someki million.    By the end of 1964, the total had dropped to lessthan 3? million.    De-control failed to increase the pool ofprivate rented houses;    it did not even halt its decline.    Thiswould have mattered less if the provision made by public authorities, who build almost entirely for letting, had matchedthe need;    but in fact public sector housing programmes havebeen quite inadequate.   Prom 1951? when 150,000 houses were built by local authorities, public sector housing rose to a peak of 221,000 in 1954.    Then it fell away year by yearuntil it reached the low level of 98,000 in 1961.   Prom this it has risen to 126-000 in 1964.    Meanwhile in the private sector there has been practically no building to let.    Theconclusion is clear.   We are faced with an ever growingshortage of accommodation within the means of poorer families;and the growth of owner-occupation can do very little to relieve it.    The only remedy is an increase in public sectorbuilding.13.    The Government have considered what the aim should be inthe public sector over the next 5 years, and have concluded that public authorities should be producing somewhere near250,000 houses in 1970 (U.K.).    with the new subsidyarrangements    (see paragraphs 30 to 3k below) the public

authorities should be able to achieve this.   Already a start hasbeen made on a rising public programme, and public authorities will build substantially more houses next year than this.11+.   But once the country has overcome its huge social problem ofslumdom and obsolescence, and met the need of the great cities for more houses let at moderate rents, the programme of subsidisedcouncil housing should decrease -    The expansion of the publicprogramme now proposed is to meet exceptional needs;    it is bornpartly of a short term necessity, partly of the conditions inherent in modern urban life.   The expansion of building for owner occupation on the other hand is normal;    it reflects a long termsocial advance which should gradually pervade every region.15.   The Government have discussed the proposed overall house-building programme, and its broad, division between houses for sale and houses to let, with the representatives of the building societies and of the builders.   Both societies and buildersrecognise the advantages of forward planning;    and they welcome the government&apos;s intention to increase the total production of houses to half a million a year by 1970*   They have stressed that if this target is to be achieved the confidence of private house buildersneeds to be strengthened, particularly in relation to the availability of land (on which sec paras. 21 to 25 below);    and theGovernment accept this.    It is a main object of the present plan to give confidence to all concerned in housebuilding.16.    The representatives of the building societies and the buildershave also accepted the Government&apos;s intention to achieve, over thenext few years,  a rising public programme to deal with the slumsand urban renewal and to meet the needs of the great cities for more rented houses;    provided that targets are flexible and subjectto a tolerance - which so far as the private sector is concernedthey thought should be 10,. or so on either side.17*    It is the Government&apos;s intention that the total housebuildingprogramme,  and its broad division between houses for owner-occupation built by private developers and houses to let built

by public authorities, should be kept under regular review withthe interests mainly concerned - the builders, the building societies and the local authorities.   The representatives of thebuilding societies and the builders agree that this should be extremely valuable to all concerned in the formulation of futureprogrammes.    If it appears in the course of the reviews thatstill better progress could be made without over-heating, the forward programmes could be increased.   Lqually of course if thereare signs of over-heating they may have to be slowed down.   Awatch will be kept on the balance between the public and theprivate sectors and the extent to which they are satisfying needs;and if it seems that changes should be made in the balanceenvisaged for future years, that can be discussed and the forwardprogrammes can if necessary be adjusted.    Neither the total programme nor the balance can be precise or - immutable;    they are intended as an indication of what the Government believe shouldbe achieved and a basis on which all concerned can plan with confidence their own contribution.THL PLAN FOR ACHIEVING THE OBJECTIVES18.   The essential requirements for carrying through the programmeoutlined above may be summarised as follows.    Some of therequirements affect both the private and the public sectors;    somerelate mainly to the private sector;    some to the public.(a) control of less essential building to give housingtop priority - along with industrial building,schools and hospitals;(b) expansion and modernisation of the construction industries;(c) making the necessary land available in good time;

These requirements are considered in more detail in thefollowing paragraphs.Control of less essential building19.     Top priority for housing - along with industrial building,schools and hospitals - can only be secured by curbing thedemand made on the ecustruction industries for less essentialpurposes.     The means of curbing excess demand did not exist whenthe Government took office last autumn.     Hence the need first toimpose an immediate ban on office building in London and then to replace it by a system of flexible controls.     This system hasbeen brought into being by the Control of Office and IndustrialDevelopment Act 1965.     In order to cover the whole field of less essential building it was decided last July to institute licensing procedure for privately sponsored construction projects of the value of  100,000 or over, outside the development districts.The legislation required to regulate priorities in this field willbe introduced during the current session,     Priorities within thepublic sector can be determined through the normal arrangements for settling the main programmes and secured so far as localauthorities are concerned by loan sanction control.     In recentyears too much work has been started, and in particular someless essential work has been permitted to compete with the priority programmes.     Under the new system of tightened controlof public expenditure announced by the Chancellor   on(1 )27th Julyx     last, the priorities within the public sector arebeing defined so as to ensure that the vital programmes arenot frustrated or hampered by work of less economic or socialimportance.     Without these new methods of curbing, throughoutboth the private and the public sectors, building which the country^ Hansard 27th July 1965, Cols. 228 to 232\

can afford to postpone, it would be impossible to achieve a steady expansion of new housebuilding to a rate of half amillion a year.The construction industries20.    As explained in the National Plan, it will not be easy for the construction industries to meet the expected rise in demandup to 1970,    A special problem will be presented by the shortage of manpower throughout the economy in the later years of the Planperiod.    The 1970 demand can therefore only be met by a continuingincrease in productivity.    This involves action on a very widefront, including the organisation and planning of the design and construction processes, with the use of the best managementtechniques; the speedy adoption of improved constructional methods and materials; more and better training at all levels; more research and development work and much wider dissemination of the results.The Ministry of Public Building and Works are generally responsible,in consultation with other Departments, for whatever governmentalaction is   needed  to increase productivity in the construction industries; and Economic Development Committees have been set upfor the civil engineering and building industries - under thechairmanship of Sir Jock Campbell - charged with the task of working out ways and means of ensuring that the 1970 targets are met.    these industries, perhaps more than most, depend for their progress and efficiency on the long-term planning of demand.   The assuredexpansion of the housing programme is thus one of the conditionsof its   own achievement.Land21.    A sharply stepped up housing programme requires a correspondingly enlarged programme of land allocation andacquisition.    In ord&apos;er to plan their programmes, both localauthorities and the bigger private builders need to know

several years in advance where they are going to build.    Thismeans that sufficient land must be allocated to housing in development plans if developers are to acquire the land they need in good time.   Just as there has to be a rolling building-programme reviewed annually, there must be a rolling landprogramme which will make it possible for land acquisition tokeep well ahead of housing starts.   Nationally and regionally,planning machinery is now being built up which will identifyland requirements in good time and ensure that every planning authority knows what is required in its area, and makes provision for it.    Settlement of regional plans - which must look 15 to 20 years forward - through this new machinery of planning wall take time.    Meanwhile a start has been made onensuring continuity of land supply over the next ten years.22.    Inside Greater London, land is already being madeavailable for a local authority housing programme averaging30,000 houses a year over the next L years.    But this willprovide only a fraction of the extra accommodation needed forLondoners.    Much more has to be provided outside greater london, where one million Londoners must be found houses by1981.   A further instalment of planned expansion schemes hasalready been announced for Ipswich, &apos;:. eterborough andNorthampton, and a large new city is to be built in NorthBuckinghamshire.    These proposals should provide accommodation for an extra 280,000 people by 1981,  the great bulk of whomwill be Londoners.   Apart from this ambitious second round ofnew towns, planning authorities throughout the South Last will shortly be told the populations for which they must plan landrequirements in their areas over the next 16 years.

(1) Cmnd, 2771.23.    Outside London, similar plans are being worked out regionby region.    For example, a new city is to be built in the Leyland-Chorley area; and the development of a large new satellitecommunity at Chelmsley Wood adjoining Birmingham is already underway.    Further new towns and expansion of existing towns will be needed; and a wide range of possibility is under examination,2k-    Local authorities and new town corporations have power to buy land - compulsorily if need be - for housebuilding whether by themselves or, where private developers need their help, for them.Private developers have experienced great difficulty in gettingan assured supply of land in some areas; and in the new and expandedtowns of the future much more land will be allocated to building for owner-occupation.    Development corporations and local authorities willbe encouraged to invite the co-operation of private developers in achieving a balanced housebuilding programme.    Generally localauthorities will be asked to work out the housing needs of their areas in terms of houses for owner-occupation as well as of houses torent; and where necessary to use their powers so that private builders can acquire in good time the land they must have if they areto carry out their part of the programme.25.    This will not, however, suffice to make sure that thenecessary land is always available to public and private developersas and when they need it,    A national agency is required, which canassemble land in quantity, well in advance, and see that it isopened up for development.    The Land Commission which the(1 )Government have already announced       will be able to do this.    Itis to have wide powers to buy land in order to provide development;and these powers will be used to help both private developers andlocal authorities.    The existence of the Commission will ensure that land is forthcoming as and when needed to sustain the expansion ofthe housing program-;e.

IReviewing the overall programme and it^components26.    Final responsibility for settling &quot;both the total programme and itsbroad division into constituent parts must he the Government&apos;s.    But the carrying-through of the programme depends on the local authorities,  theconstruction industries and the financial agencies, notably the building societies; and the programme will be achieved only if all concerned under-stand what is wanted and work within the plan.  Hence the Governments&quot;fa Op SS&quot;t jjlsintention, made clear above,/the forward programmes in consultation and,it is hoped,  in agreement with representatives of all those interested,and to keep the plan under constant review with them.    The construction industries,  in particular, have been badly affected in the past by want of confidence,  which has discouraged investment in new plant and methods and has contributed to periods of over-load and to price inflation,    Inorder to give the building and financial interests and the local authoritiesadequate assurance about long term prospects,it is intended that the pro-grammes should cover several years ahead,  although the size of the increases planned for the later years will neeed to be provisional,  atany rate to begin with.    As the sources of information improve it will bepossible to review and refine these forward forecasts.27.    The discussions which have been held with the representatives of the&quot;building societies and the builders (paras 15 to 17 above) heve alsocovered the means of ensuring that the amount of building done in theprivate sector corresponds, broadly, with the amount expected and allowed for in the overall plan.    It has seemed to the Government that the most satisfactory way of doing this would be for the building societies to agree in advance on the amount of capital they will advance year by year for new building: corresponding arrangements being made with the other main lendingagencies - the insurance companies and the local authorities.    The repre-sentatives of the building societies and builders,  once they were satis-fied that the Government envisaged growth in the private sector as wellas in the public,  agreed that it would be sensible to plan the rate towhich it should grow; and they are now exploring with the Housing Depart-ments the practicability of ensuring that growth is at the planned rate -on the understanding to which reference has already been made,  that targetsshould be flexible and subject to a good measure of tolerance.The Standard of private housebuilding28.    The National House-Builders Registration Council was established&apos; to- set standards and to control by inspection and- 1h -

9 icertification the standard of private housbuilding.     In recent months, with encouragement from the Government, the Council hasraised its requirements and substantially increased theprotection offered by its scheme.     One weakness remains.Building firms which subscribe to the scheme do so on a voluntary basis;    at present only about 30/b of all new privatehouses are covered.     The Government understands that the Council areexploring with the Council of the Building SocietiesAssociation the possibility of making adherence to the scheme a condition for a building society advance on a new house.The Government are determined to ensure that houses for owner-occupation are built to acceptable standards and that purchasersare protected against shoddy work.     Since they would prefer these results to be secured by voluntary action on the part ofthe agencies concerned with constructing and financing privatehousebuilding, they will await the conclusion of the discussions between the two Councils before considering what further action may be needed.Help to owner-occuoiers29.   The Government strongly support the movement towards extendedowner-occupation which brings with it a standard of maintenance and repair by no means always found in privately rented houses.   As soonas the country&apos;s economic situation allows they will publish their plans for bringing owner-occupation within the reach of morefamilies.    They have already announced in the White Paper on theLand Commission that the Commission will be able to dispose of landfor owner-occupied housing on favourable terms.The finance    of public sector housing30. Present rates of housing subsidies are inadequate even for thepresent rate of housebuilding. They were settled in 1961; and even then they had no relationship to the cost of building.

The worst trouble which has besot the local authorities has beenuncertainty about interest charges, which account for a very substantial part of each authority&apos;s annual coots on new housing.This uncertainty, and. the high rates of interest prevailing in recent times, have made forward programming very difficult.Anothe:   trouble has been that the present subsidy structuredoes not sufficiently allow for the fact that the cost ofbuilding, including land cost, is necessarily higher in some areas than in others.      In devising a new subsidy structurethe Government have therefore had two main objects in view.First, to provide a stable financial basis for housing programmesby eliminating uncertainty about interest rates.     Second, to seethat high costs attract proportionately higher subsidy.    Theyhave accordingly decided to introduce a subsidy based on separately of interest and will introduce legislation to provide forthis.31 .   In place of the existing basic subsidy, normally of .P,2h adwelling, each local authority will receive a basic subsidy onnewly completed houses, calculated so as to produce broadly thesame effect on its housing accounts as though the loan raised to finance their construction (including land and site costs) hadborne interest at U% per annum.     This will mean a substantial increase in the subsidy.       ven so local authorities with bighousing needs will have to charge rents which are related to the capacity of their tenants to pay if they are to secure the proper use of their whole housing pool (see yara.1+0).u o elementary subsidy-dies will be paid for building on expensive sites, building high, using

local materials to preserve the character of an area, precautions against subsidence, and building for overspill.    Provision willbe made to give additional help to local authorities which haveparticularly heavy housing commitments (including those resultingfrom meeting the needs of incoming industry) in relation to theirrent and rate resources.    Further details are in Appendix 1.32.    The basic interest rate subsidy, being related to thecapital cost of completed houses, will vary with that cost; and,of course, it will vary with the prevailing rates of interest.Direct comparison with the present subsidies, which are payable on a unit basis, is therefore not possible but comparisonsrelated to some typical cases are given in Appendix 1.    subsidies for new town development corporations and housing associationswill be improved along the same general lines.33*   ^e^jiew^subsidies will apply t^a^ljiou^^for^ which atender is acce^ted^bv^ja^resoJLut^ijjn^jpaj^ of presentation of this Paper.3k *    The Government intend that the improved subsidies should beused to raise housing standards.    They will expect localauthorities, new town corporations and housing associationsnormally to incorporate in new designs and the space and heating(1 )standards recommended by the Parker Morris Committeev   y.    a growing number of local authority houses already incorporatethem - h&amp;% of dwellings approved in the first quarter of thisyear were designed to the full space standards and        to theheating standards.    The Government believe that many families willincreasingly be prepared to pay higher rents for better (andwarmer) houses, and that long before the life of today&apos;s housescome to an end the Parker Morris standards will be regarded asthe minimum which every house should reach.(1) Homes for Today and Tomorrow 1961.

Industrialised Building35.   Housebuilding must be increasingly industrialised to get thenumber we need.    This involves the use by the industry of improvedtechniques of construction, handling, site organisation and management.    It means also the thorough organisation and timing ofthe whole process by the client, designer and construction team.Industry has put much effort into development work and capital investment and the Government intend to produce conditions forindustrialised systems to operate effectively and on a growing scale.36.    Confidence in the level of demand is essential.    It can best be generated by setting forward programmes and stabilisingthe financial basis through the new subsidy arrangements.Authorities&apos; readiness to use industrialised methods will be a factor taken into account in deciding the level at which their programmes will be set.   Rational organisation of the market isalso necessary to take advantage of industrialised techniques.Grouping of demand, and the wider use of common designs will be helped, by the general adoption of Parker Morris space andheating s tandards.37.   Advisory services to housing authorities have been steppedup to help thern get the best architectural and economic results.A pattern of collaboration with the National Building Agency isbeing worked out and. advice will shortly be given to authorities on how they can increase and improve the use of industrialisedmethods.   Appendix 2 gives information on progress so far andlists the support services available to authorities.Local authority -programmes38.    Local authority housing will be controlled through the(1 )rolling four-year programmes initiated earlie    this yearv    .The Government intend that the total public programme should be allocated according to the needs of the different regions;    and within each region according to the priority attaching to(1 ^Circular Ho.21/65 (-england):    Circular 2/65 (Wales).

particular local needs.    These allocations will take account of theemerging picture of regional and local housing situations resultingfrom improved information ahout housing needs and demands.    (SeeAppendix 3).    Meantime first priority will he given to relieving the acute shortage of houses to rent in the conurbations - especially in areas which attract newcomers including immigrants from theCommonwealth - and to clearing the great concentrations of slums.Tenancy and rent policies39.    Provision of more council houses must he accompanied by policies for allocating tenancies and for determining rents which ensure thatthe extra houses fulfill the social purpose for which the subsidies are provided.    The responsibility for allocating tenancies is a local one.Rightly so, since local knowledge must guide those who have the difficult task of deciding an order of priority among families whosehousing needs differ only in the degree of hardship under which theyare living.    But the allocation of local authority houses can give riseto considerations which are not wholly local in character.    Anexcessively local approach to need - especially an insistence on alengthy period of residence in the area as a condition for getting a tenancy - can operate very haoshly.    This applies particularly tothe housing of immigrants and ex-servicemen.    Insistence onresidential qualifications must also impede industrial mobility.Excessive residential qualifications were criticised in 1955 by the(1)Central Housing Advisory Committee x &apos; and their criticisms wereendorsed by the Milner Holland Committee in their report on London.    (2)Housingv  1,Residential Qualifications 1955:    Fifth report of the HousingManagement Sub-Committee of the Central Housing AdvisoryCommittee.-19-NReport of the Committee on Housing in Greater London(Cmnd. 2605) p. ;13h.

2+0.    Rent policies are also for local decision.    But if the extrasubsidies now to he provided are to he used,  as they should he,  to relieve those with the greatest social need,  these policies shouldreflect the fact that the financial circumstances of counciltenants vary widely.    This means that subsidies should not beused wholly or even mainly to keep general rent levels low.Help for those who most need it can be given only if the sub-subsidies are in large part used to provide rebates for tenantswhose means are small,    A number of authorities have had the courage to adopt thorough-going rent rebate schemes and have found that it does not entail raising general rent levels beyondthe means fo the majority of their tenants.    The more generoussubsidies now to be provided create an opportunity for all authoritiesto review their rent policies along these lines.    In doing so,they will be able to take into account the higher standards of accommodation which will increasingly be provided with the aid ofthe new subsidies.    On both matters - tenancy and rent policies -there will be consultations with thft local authorities.The^existing housirpj^js^tock2+1-    This Paper is concerned primarily with the house-building programme.    But it is important too that more should be done toimprove the condition of existing houses.    A proper share of building resources must be devoted to the maintenance and repair of olderhouses and to stepping up the rate of improvement.2+2.    The number of dwellings improved annually remainsobstinately at the disappointing level of 125,000 or so.    TheGovernment will encourage local authorities to greater efforts\

in promoting house improvement coupled with improvement o&apos;fwhole areas - including better street lighting, play areas,parking space and so on.    For each town there ought to be a considered programme of renewal and conservation, area by area,taking account of the physical conditions of the houses and possible road and traffic requirements.    Meantime in most large towns and cities there are districts of old, structurally sound,houses lacking baths, hot water and inside lavatories, whichcould be identified, in advance of a comprehensive plan for thewhole town, as worth conserving, and which would well repay, interms of better living, the effort involved in improving boththe houses and the surroundings.43.    Maintenance and improvement is the field for the smallerbuilder; many small firms engage entirely in this type of work.Productivity is generally lower than in new building and thescope for industrialisation is less.    But there is room evenhere for improved techniques.    For example, progress has beenmade in developing prefabricated plumbing and bathroom units which can te used in house improvement.    Output in improvementwork should rise as it is organised more and more on an areabasis.kk,    The Government are seeking by forward planning of the wholehousebuilding programme to ensure steady growth, while avoiding the risk    of setting up inflationary pressures.    In doing this they must also have regard to the effort which mustsimultaneously be made to raise the general standard ofmaintenance, repair and improvement of the existing, olderhouses.    The annual review of programmes will take into account the resources available to meet all the housing needs; and it willbe the responsibility of the Government to ensure that theseare used to the best advantage over the whole field.

CONCLUSIONhfr.   This White Paper sets out the first stage in the formulation of anational housing plan.    It is only the first stage.   For a comprehensive and firmly bases plan much more must be known about the reality of housing[needs - not just the crude needs in terms of slums, overcrowding,1 obsolescence and the increasing number of households, young and old - but[needs in terms of the sort of houses people want and for which they areprepared to pay.   What is the real demand for owner-occupation; in //hatcircumstances do people prefer to rent; what is the scope for co-operativeownership; what kinds of tenure best serve the country&apos;s economic needs,facilitating mobility of labour?   Far too little research has been doneinto these questions; yet the answers are vital to housing policy.1(6.    The whole question of housing finance also needs much deeper studythan this Government has yet had the time to give to it.1(7.    There are other questions relating to the management and improvementof the existing housing stock which are still inadequately understood.Must it be assumed that the only thing to do with old houses is to pullthem down as soon as it is possible to replace them?   Would not peopleoften prefer to continue living in the existing houses if a radical policyof environmental as well as house improvement could be devised?U8.   Nevertheless the foundation for a comprehensive national housing planhas now been laid.    Government hitherto have been able to plan forwardprogrammes in the public sector and to have discussions with representativesof the local authorities about financial and other requirements to supportthose programmes; but it has not been possible to plan house-building asa whole.    Now for the first time, the Government, the building societies and the builders have discussed together and agreed on the need forforward planning of housebuilding, and for continuous collaboration toensure a steadily rising programme.    For the first time the pre-requisitesof forward planning, including adequate incentives and flexible controls,are being formulated.    It should now be possible, with the new arrangementsfor regular consultation and review among all the interests concerned, toensure a steadily rising house-building programme.   From this start a comprehensive plan covering all facets of housing policy can be evolved.

APPENDIX 1NBv/ SUBSIDIES FOR LOCAL AUTHORITY housing.     The Bill.   A Bill will he introduced during the present session of Parliament to provide for a new subsidy structure inLngland and V/ales.    (There will be a separate Bill for Scotland).The ibroad framework is set out in the following paragraphs.2.     Basic and Supplementary Subsidies.    The new subsidies will comprise -(a)   A basic subsidy(h)    Supplementary subsidies where appropriate for:-(i)    expensive sites(ii)    high flats(iii)   building in special materials(iv)    town development and development akin to newtowns3*      Period of subsidies and review.    The new subsidies will applyto houses for which the tender was accepted by a resolution passedfollowing the date of presentation of the Paper.    Fxcept for thetown development supplement (para. 5(b)) they will he payable for60 years,  subject to provision for possible review from time totime.h.     The basic subsidy.    An entirely new form of basic subsidy willtake the place of the  2h a house ( 8 in some cases) normallypayable under existing legislation.It will be calculated in respect of all approved dwellingscompleted in any financial year and will take the form of a contribution towards the loan charges incurred in financing their capital cost (land and buildings).    The subsidy will be calculated as the difference between loan charges payable on loans of theamount of the capital costs at current rate of interest and atUyc   For these purposes the current rate of interest for any year&apos;ssubsidy calculation will be determined by the Minister as(v)(vi)extra cost of precautions against subsidencespecial needs.

representing the average rate of interest paid on new loans raisedby local authorities in the preceding year.5.     Supplementary Subsidies(a) The subsidies for expensive sites, high flats, building in   special materials and precautions against subsidencewill be on the same general lines as those payable forthese purposes under existing legislation but there willbe some detailed changes in the formulae for calculatingthem and in the qualifying conditions.(b) Dwellings built under schemes of town development (orunder comprehensive development schemes which are accepted as similar to new town development) will;qualify for additional subsidy of  12 for a period of10 years.   This will be matched by an equivalentcontribution from the authority for the exporting area where the provision of the dwellings operates for therelief of housing need in that area.(c) Special needs.    Some authorities qualify for additionalsubsidy under existing legislation where they have heavyhousing commitments in relation to their resources.    Thishas been of particular value to many authorities in &quot;ales.This subsidy cannot be continued in its present form as this is related to the method of assessing the presentbasic subsidies but a comparable form of subsidy willN  be payable in broadly the same circumstances.    provision will also be made for additional subsidies to localauthorities where there is urgent need for additionalhousing accommodation to meet the needs of incomingworkers, which cannot be met without imposingunreasonable increases in rents or rates.6*     Hostels grant..   The maximum grant payable under 8.15 of theHousing (Financial Provisions) Act 1958 will be increased from  5to  15 a bedroom.- 2k -\

7.     Effect of Subsidy:   A bffa interest subsidy is,  in effect, a percentage grant, the percentage depending on the borrowing rateof interest.    The contribution which the subsidy makes in respectof each dwelling will therefore vary with the capital cost of thedwelling.    The following table shows for a small number of sampleauthorities - none of which were in Greater London - the range of annual contributions which the new basic subsidy would have made if it had applied to dwellings for which tenders were let in1Q6U/65.   A borrowing rate of 6- ,. has been assumed,   Some of thedwellings may, of course, have qualified for supplementarysubsidies too.Basic Subsidy per dwellingBangeMedianDwellings up to 3 storeys 37 to  89 6hDwellings over 3 storeys 66 to  94 81

Flats built by industrialised methods now show on average a small price advantage.    Traditional building isstill slightly cheaper for houses.    To develop the potentialadvantages of industrialised building for flats and houseslong runs, continuity,  and a reasonable measure of standardisation are necessary.    The general adoption of spaceand heating standards recommended in the Parker Morris report will help in this direction.    The Government also intend tosecure the general use of its recommended floor-to-floordimension which determines many other structural requirements.Housing Departments and National Building Agency3.      The Departments and the Agency are working closelytogether to help the industry and housing authorities.    TheMinistry is responsible for general policy and will take the lead on user requirements and relations with authorities,whilst the Agency will act as specialist consultants and takethe lead on constructional techniques and relations with theindustry.Services to authoritiesk.      The regional offices of the Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment have been expanded and now operate in Birmingham,- 26 -

Bristol, Leeds, Kanchester, Newcastle, and Nottingham.    the agency&apos;s offices are in London, Edinburgh, Manchester andNewcastle.5-     Guidance on the following aspects of industrialisedbuilding will be offered:-(a) Choice of sites.(b) Appraisal of systems by the Agency.(c) Choice of dwelling type, layout and system.(d) Organisation of serial building programmes.(e) Pre-contract and contract procedures.6.     Professional services will also be offered where appropriate and a small number of demonstration projectswill be carried out.- 2-7 -

APPENDIX 3IMPROVELiENT IN SOURCES OF information the need for better information.      In establishing housing programmes in the way proposed inthis Paper the Government must accept responsibility in collaboration with the local authorities for the assembly and regular revision of information about the whole housing situationin the regions and, below7 the regional level, at least in themain centres of population.2.     At the local level, housing authorities have a statutoryduty to review housing conditions in their areas.    But it isnot enough for the Government to rest on unco-ordinated assess-ments by each housing authority.    Guidance must be given aboutthe economic and social context in which local housing needs areto be viewed - that is a purpose of the regional studies.3.     Reliable and up-to-date information is required abouthousing needs and demands,  trends in the housing market and theirimpact on the national economy.    The starting point is knowledgeabout population and household changes; about housing stock,its tenure, equipment and condition and the incidence of over-crowding, multi-occupation and shortages; and about the economicsof housing,  such as building costs, the levels and changes inrents, other housing costs, and house prices in relation to the accommodation and to incomes.Filling the gaps4.     The Governments decision to carry out a sample census of population and Housing in April 1966 will materially improvenational and local information about population and householdchanges; about migration, and about the number, tenure,occupancy and equipment of the housing stock.- 28 -N

5.     To supplement the Censuses regular surveys will &quot;be carriedout on a scale sufficient to provide, at least for the mostimportant items, indicators of current trends.   A series ofsample surveys in depth will be undertaken into the housing conditions in the main conurbations, starting in 1966.6.     One of the most difficult gaps to fill concerns thecondition of the housing stock.   A set of common standards is needed by reference to which assessments can be made of fitnessfor habitation and of potentiality for improvement.   A sub-committee of the Central Housing Advisory Committee is examining the formulation of such standards, and the Housing departments are working on techniques for the rapid assessment of the-condition of houses.7. Statistics of costs of new housebuilding will be providedby returns from local authorities. One aim is to construct aprice index of standard items that enter into local authorityhousebuilding costs. This will enable assessments to be madeof the extent to which changes in prices follow from improvedstandards.8.     New information, supplementing survey information on rentsin the private sector will be provided as a by-product of theadministration of the new rent assessment machinery.   A fullerknowledge of the relationship region by region between rents and incomes will be obtained from increasing the size of thesample on which the Ministry of Labour&apos;s Family expenditure survey is based.9.      Information about the level,  structure and changes in price for various types of houses in the private sector indifferent areas will shortly be available from new returns tobe provided regularly by building societies.   This enquiry is necessarily restricted to houses on which building societies

have advanced mortgages.    Means of providing a widely-basedand reliable index of the movement in house prices are being examined.10.   A regular survey of mortgage loans has been arranged,which will provide broad information on a regional basis aboutthe dwellings on which mortgages are granted; about the house-holds concerned by family type and income, and about the termsof mortgage advances.11.    Information is similarly required to show the groups of population entering into new tenancies of Council houses.    Pilotstudies have been started.12,    The institution of these new statistical series and surveyswill provide the basic material for deeper analysis of a numberof topics.    One such is the interaction of labour mobility andthe provision of housing.    Another concerns consumer choice.What determines people&apos;s preferences for owner-occupation orfor renting?   Then there are social questions.   Are attitudesto living in flats changing?   How is the spread of car-ownershipaffecting attitudes to housing requirements?   Some small partof this ground has been covered by sociological researchundertaken by the Housing Departments but there is a need todevelop techniques for forming reliable judgements in this difficult field, and this it is hoped to do.Publication of Information13.    The Housing Departments propose to supplement existingpublications by a new statistical abstract on Housing, whichwill present in a readily accessible form the main statisticalaggregates on a wide range of housing topics.

APESNDIX 4HOUSING ?;JGQ?.DS OP C-JPTAIN\^3?:.m JUBOPBUN COUNTPIBS1.     Comparison between the house building records of differentcountiries is not easy to make.   Broadly, all are faced with three similar problems - present shortages, an increase in thenumber of families and the need to replace out-of-date housing.Eut the size of each of these problems varies from country tocountry.   So do housing policies and traditions.    So dostandards.   And it is not easy to compare like with like interms of value for money.2.     Nevertheless it is possible to make some rough comparison of the outturn of new dwellings and the relative importancedifferent countries put on housing.    The following table showsfor the U.K. and six other principal housebuilding countriesin v.&apos;estern europe:-(i)   figures for 1961-63 and 1964 of number of dwellingsbuilt per 1000 population;and (ii)    the proportion of gross national product devoted tofixed capital formation and within that total, to housing, in 1961-63Country   New houses completedannually per 1000populationGross Domesticfixed capital formation as %of G.N.P.Grossfixed   Col (4)capital^s % offormat^ycol (3)ion inhous ingas   % of.N.P.1961-631964(Average 1961-63)	(1)	(2)	(3)	(4)	(5)Sweden	10.2	11.4	23.0	5.3	23.8West Germany 9*6		9.8	25.1	5.6	22.2Netherlands	6.8	8.3	24.1	4.0	16.5Prance	6.8(a)	7.6(a)	19.7	4.8	24.6Italy	6.7	8.1	23.3	6.1	26.2U.K.	5.8   :	6.9	16.5	3.1	18.8Belgium	5.1(h)	N.A.	19.8	4.8	24.2NO TBS;   (a) New dwellings and additional dwellings produced by&quot;    ; conversion, resToration or extension of ,existing- .  . buildings,(b) Average of 1961 and 1962 only.&apos; &quot;- -\

3.     The figure for new houses per 1,000 population conceal some differences in average dwelling size.    The figures to make an effective comparison of floor area are not available, hut anadditional check is possible from the figures of the gross numberof rooms in new housing per 1,000 population for 1961-64, and theU.K. occupies the same position in that table, about the samedistance behind the leaders, as it does for the total dwellingsper thousand.4-     The table shows that gross fixed capital formation in housingaccounts for a smaller share of gross national product in the U.K.than in any of the other countries.   This takes no account of productivity or of value for money, but comparison of the two parts   of the table suggests that Sweden and Germany obtain theirlead in numbers of houses built in proportion to their populationprimarily by devoting a greater proportion of their national resources and of their capital investment to housing than we do.
