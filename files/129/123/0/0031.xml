THE SCUTTISH ECONOMY 1965-70:  DRAFT WHITS paper memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland a draft White Paper on the Scottish Economy is circulated here-with for the information of my colleagues, in accordance with thedecision of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Development at their meeting on 6th December.    The size of the forestry planting programme,which was the only point of detail then outstanding, has since been settled, and this is now dealt with in paragraph 119 of Chapter VI.2.       The final text cannot be settled until Ministers have reacheddecisions on the scheme for investment grants, due to be announced on1st January.    The most vital aspect of that scheme in the present con-text is the provision of locational industrial inducements in some formthroughout the whole of Scotland except Edinburgh, an aspect which has -as I understand it - not been at issue.    It would suffice for my purpose to be able to say in my White Paper that the Government have decided on an extension of development areas, comprehending this withoutspecifying the precise form the inducements will in future take.3.       In any case I will ensure that the changes necessary in thepresent draft are agreed with the Ministers concerned.     They affectlargely Chapter V (dealing with industry), which is the reason why this chapter is not yet in proof form.    Other passages which will needadjustment are noted in the annex to this paper;   and I intend to recastthe Introduction in a more personal form.4.       I am informed by the Stationery Office that, owing to the delay infinalising the passages involving reference to investment grants and thesecurity measures which must be observed in setting these up before 1st January, publication before 13th January is impracticable.     This isthe very latest date I can accept, and I invite my colleagues to assist in ensuring that ail necessary steps are taken to achieve this date.W.R.Scottish Office, S.W.I.14th December, 1965; DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY CP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)66C.(65) 181 COPY NO,_15th December, 1965CABINET

CHAPTER VMANUTACTuTlING industry.     Manufacturing industry has a key role to play in Scotland&apos;s economicplan.     Manufacturing industry in Scotland achieved the national average rateof growth cf output during 196O/64 and exceeded it in 1963/64*     Output per head has risen faster in Scotland both in 1954-60 and in 1960-64 than inGreat Britain as a whole.     It is essential if the objectives for the futureare to be realised that recent rates of growth be not only sustained butincreased,2,     For the period to 1970 the projections in Table A of Chapter IIset as an objective for manufacturing industry a rate of growth in output of4*6 per cent per annum, with but a relatively small net increase in employ-ment of 0,6 per cent per annum;   both rates slightly higher than for theUnited Kingdom as a whole.     Manufacturing output could bhus rise in total by31 per cent over the whole period and employment by 25,000 people (after takingaooount&apos; of declines in employment in ths contracting sectors of industry).    Aain the Plan for the United Kingdom progress in Sootland&apos;s manufacturing industry, even with fewer emigrants and higher participation rates, must restfor much the greater part on a further rise in productivity which will depend largely on a high rate of investment in plant and buildings.     The objective is to achieve a rate of no less than 4.0 per cent, again a higher target than for the country as a whole.3.     The way ahead for manufacturing industry in Scotland is achievablein the context of the Governments measures, as stated in the National Plan,to secure the rate of growth needed in the United Kingdom&apos;s output and exports.     There is a sound basis for confidence not only in the recentlyimproved rate of advance in the output, employment and productivity of scottish manufacturing industry but in the prevailing changes in its character and structure, and in the radical improvement being made to the infrastruc-ture in Scotland.Changing Character and Structure4*     The earlier chapters of this plan have illustrated some of the broad changes in the disposition of Scotland1s manufacturing industry interms of output and employment in broad industry groups.     But these outwardchanges reflect more fundamental ones in its character and structure whichhave been gathering momentum,5,     The most significant change which has been taking place has beenthe lessening relative role of many of the older sectors of Scottish industryand the development of many new industries.    While the rapidly growingsector already established may not advance so quickly as in the period whenmany of its members were building up for the first time in Scotland, morenew firms are entering Scotland under the Government&apos;s policies.     There is good reason to believe that the expanding elements of both established andnew industries will exert the predominant influence between now and 1970.*?      C b a

Management, Productivity and Bfficiency6.     The steady integration of industry in Scotland with larger groups and firms both outside and inside the United Kingdom means that a large partof the Scottish industry can now draw on the resources of groups operating ona national and international scale.   Scottish industry is now less self-contained than formerly and is to an increasing extent part of a wider indust-rial scene.   This is being accentuated by the tendency towards large scale production which necessitates Scottish manufacturers securing materials and components from specialist suppliers wherever they may be.   These developmentsdo not preclude the possibility of the growth of component suppliers inScotland to meet the needs of irajor users in this country but such developmentswill have to be economic and capable of meeting the challenge of competition from else?/here.7.     The economies of manpower which have resulted from the modernisation of Scottish manufacture have brought many human problems of re-deployment.But these economies have also helped to strengthen Scottish industry infiercely competitive markets.   This process cannot be stopped.   It is theessential means of transferring human and physic?.! resources to new tasks,new products and new markets.8.     The changes in the structure of manufacture in Scotland may be lessdrastic between now and 1970 but they are bound to continue as technologicalchange is inevitable.   While management in Scottish industry has t o a great extent adapted itself to the changed conditions the need i3 for management to look ahead and evolve still more progressive policies;    to undertakeresearch and development into new products:   to utilize the growing v-olumeof expert services available from industry and Government;    to augment the useof computer services and new office techniques.9.     Evidence of rising productivity has a special importance forScotland.   In the final analysis it must provide the confidence for industry from elsewhere to expand into Scotland on the scale required to maximise theuse of Scotland&apos;s labour resources and reduce the drift away of Scotland1smanpower and womanpower.   And it will fulfil the objective of the national economic Plan to use the extra labour resources in the less developed regionsin the most productive way.Changes in Facilities and Locations10.     The facilities and locational opportunities for manufacturing inScotland are also being recast on a significant scale.   In the next fiveyears manufacturers will be operating with a main road, main port, and mainrail network progressively improved by schemes outlined elsewhere in this plan.   A major new internal airport is being created at Abbotsinch and air services are developing rapidly,   rower and water supplies are being planned to match chs growth expected in industrial output, and these, together withthe wide range of new educational and training measures are described inother chapters.11.     The growth in manufacturing output envisaged will call for thedevelopment of new industrial areas.    Important new sub-centres of industry have already been established in the four Scottish New Towns, and on Boardof Trade and local authority industrial estates, e.g., at Newhouse, Donibristleand Irvine.    Others are at an earlier stage in Falkirk and Bellshill.    isyet these developments have not materially altered the basic distribution2.

of the industrial population tut there are clear indications that this ischanging.     Glasgow&apos;s share of manufacturing employment has fallen and many other areas have increased their share, e.g. North Lanarkshire, Cumbernauld,Kilmarnock, Dundee, Fife, Dumfries and both the Highlands and the Borders.12,     In achieving the growth in manufacturing output required by 1970?a progressive increase is needed in the mobility of the manufacturing labour force and in the provision of housing to assist industrial expansion.     Thesematters are discussed in the Chapters on Labour and Housing.Distribution of Industry Measures13*     The Government has intensified measures to ensure a better distri-bution of industry throughout the U.K. and the Development Districts inScotland are among the principal areas where industry will be encouraged tosettle.     The control of industrial development certificates has been made more stringent in areas of severe labour shortage and congestion.     new legislation has been passed and has already been applied to control office development in the London and Birmingham areas.     Plans have been announced to introduce building licensing other than for industrial building and housing, but the development districts v/ill be exempted.     Tn Scotland these districts now cover more than 70 per cent of Scotland&apos;s insured employees and more than 85 per cent of the wholly unemployed.14.     To assist industry in Scottish Development Districts financialassistance has been given on a liberal scale.     The provision of advancefactories by the Board of Trade which are a valuable inducement to industryto settle in Development Districts has been stepped up,     /lore land is being acquired in Scotland to accommodate Board of Trade factories.     In the pastfour years the Board of Trade land holding in Scotland has increased from1,576 acres to the present 1,830  acres and current action will raise this total to nearly 2,100 acres,15.     New towns and local authorities in Scotland are now playing a major part in the public provision of modern factory space - often in theform of advance factories.     While not all this space is taken by industrynew to Scotland, a substantial proportion has been in recent years.     these activities continue to form a most useful inducement to industry.16.     The attraction of new industry in Scotland in recent years hasbeen a most powerful force in diversifying industry in Scotland.     In thefive and a half years to mid-1965 more new companies were attracted intoScotland than in the fifteen years from 1945 &quot;to 1959 - 141 compared to127.     So far during 1965 /J^hirty-eight7 new companies have decided to set upin Scotland /position at end September/ compared to thirty-five in the wholeof last year.     /5he latest figures of new projects, i.d.c&apos;s etc., will beintroduced just before the paper finally goes to print/1.17.     The availability in the Development Districts of extensive measuresof financial assistance under the Local Employment Acts and also the &quot;free depreciation&quot; provisions for new industrial plant and machinery introduced in the Finance Act 1963 have undoubtedly been of benefit to Scotland.Firms which have come to Scotland have found their financial problems easedand firms already in Scotland, encouraged especially by the standard grants and the free depreciation provisions have been encouraged to undertakeexpansions on a scale and with a speed which might otherwise have beeninpracticable.3

Exportswi*r   &quot;&quot;&quot;nil18.     Scotland depends for her standard of living, equally with the restof the United Kingdom, on exports.     There are no official figures of Scottishexports hut there is g&apos;0d reason to believe that these are fully proportionate to Scotland&apos;s share of industrial output.     The National Plan indicates theneed for a rate of growth in exports of 5g Per cent a year up to 1970.     Withthe more than proportionate part that Scotland must play in raising national output, exports of goods manufactured in Scotland will need to grow at atleast the United Kingdom rate.19.     Scotland&apos;s export contribution goes far beyond the startling per-formance of commonly known exports such as whisky and knitwear and embraces a wide range of chemicals, plant and machinery, vehicles and engines, textiles,foodstuffs and many other products.     There has been a steady growth of exportactivity by Scottish organisations, notably in overseas trade missions,organised by Scottish Chambers of Commerce, the Scottish Council (development and Industry) and other export groups in Scotland.     Given a growth in world trade Scottish exports should expand and contribute a fully proportionate part to the growth required by the National Plan.Prospects and &quot;Future Action20.     To achieve a growth in manufacturxng output in Scotland of 4.6 percent a year to 1970 will call for increases in output over a wide range ofindustry in Scotland, established and new.     Preliminary studies made by theScottish Economic Planning Board in mechanical engineering, electronics,domestic electrical appliances, business machines and carpets together with information gained from industry, in the course of regional investigations,strongly suggest that the overall target can be met.     Two basio establishedmanufacturing industries call for special comment.Iron and Steel21.     The major development in Scotland in recent years has been the com-pletion in 1964 of the strip mill scheme.     Other developments have includedmodifications to a heavy section mill for the rolling of universal beams,the installation of a 4-high 10 ft. plate mill and the modernisation of works for the production of high carbon and alloy quality billets.     At anotherplant a new tube mill has been extensively reconstructed and was re-opened inSeptember, 1964;   the range of products has been extended and tubes can beproduced not only for the iil industry but for gas undertakings and users ofcircular and rectangular section steel tubes.     As a result of these develop-ments the Scottish steel industry is now highly diversified and can produce a wide range of heavy and light rolled steel products as well as forgings andcastings.22.     The production of crude steel and pig iron in Scotland fell frompeak figures of 2.7 million tons and 1.3 million tons respectively in I960 to1.895 million tons and .866 million tons in 1962.     Following the improvementin economic activity, prjduction rose to record levels in 1964* of 2.974 million tons of crude steel and 1.540 million tons of pig iron and has been running ateven higher rates during the first six months of 1965 when output of crude^&quot;Statistically, a 53 week year4.

steel reached 1.631 million tons (against 1.45 million tons in 1964);   theoutput of pig iron was 0,843 million tons against 0.761 million tons in 1964.Crude steel capacity utilisation during the first half of 1965 was 80 percent.23.     The iron and Steel Board, in agreement with the British Iron andSteel Federation, the Joint Iron Council and the Trade Unions, estimated inFebruary, 1965, that the home production requirement of crude steel in theUnited Kingdom in 1970 would be 29.5 million tons.     /The United KingdomNational Plan now envisages a slightly higher figure of 30.75 million tons. ?Scotland&apos;s share was assessed at 12 per cent of this total or 3.54 million tons.The Board estimated that in Scotland the numbers employed in the industry would decline slightly from 31.1 thousands in 1964 to 29.6 thousands in 1970.24.     The increase in output per man-year for the United Kingdom as awhole from I960 to 1964 was 1.5 per cent per annum;   the estimate for 1964 to1970 has been put at 2.8 per cent per annum.     Increases in labour produc-tivity in recent years have come about primarily as a result of technologicalchanges and the concentration of production in larger more modern plants.The estimate for 1970 has been based on the assumption that savings in man-power will continue for these reasons.25.     The Iron and Steel Board fuel that any expansion of capacity thatmay be required to meet production requirements at least up to the early 1970scan be provided at existing works, without recourse to new green-field siteswith the attendant heavy capital expenditure.Shipbuilding26.     At the end of September I965 there were 3.1 million gross tons ofmerchant ships on order and under construction in the United Kingdom;    of this figure about 870,000 gross tons were at Scottish yards which have about a third of the country&apos;s shipbuilding capacity.     Some 900,000 tons of orders were placed In the financial year 1963/64 under the Shipbuilding Credit Scheme ofwhich 340,000 tons were placed with Scottish yards.     The industry in scotland is well engaged at present and most yards have work which will carry themforward into 1967, including the nexv Cunarder at Clydebank which will be financed largely by a Government loan under the credit scheme.27.     Nevertheless the Scottish industry, like the United Kingdom industry as a whole, faces substantial problems arising essentially from fierce inter-national competition.     Scotland&apos;s share of the nation&apos;s output of ships hasbeen falling (from 39 per cent in the first few years after the war to 34 percent in i960 t.i I964).     Several Scottish yards have already closed.     huchunremunerative business has been taken.     host of the yards are on restrictedsites where expansion to facilitate the building of the largest vessels isdifficult.     The recent revival of the industry which has brought valuable nev/export business, is being impeded by shortage of skilled labour which left theindustry when the total labour force declined sharply after 1958, and foundother employment.     In these circumstances the industry has been vulnerableon a number of counts and a Receiver has had to be appointed for one major yardwhich faced acute financial difficulties.     Nevertheless the industry inScotland remains one of the i?orid&apos;s prime sources of ships, a reservoir of experience and talent.     A measure of concentration has already been under way;and an imaginative scheme to create a large new shipyard is under study.28.     The United Kingdom industry is at present being reviewed by anindependent Committee of Inquiry appointed by the Government to recommend what: 5.

action is necessary by management, labour and the Government to make the ship-building industry competitive in world markets.     The Committee is expected toreport next year.     The future course of the industry up to 1970 cannot be clearly foreseen and much may depend on action arising from the report of theCommittee of Inquiry.     It seems unlikely however that the industry&apos;s labour force in 1970 will be larger than it is now.Rural Industry29.     The operation of the Government1s distribution of industry policy bythe Board of Trade and the measures of financial assistance available underthe Local Employment Acts have been of considerable assistance to industry inthe rural areas and country towns in Development Districts.     The financialassistance provided by the Highland Fund (with Treasury assistance) in the highlands and Islands has also greatly benefited small enterprises in these areas.     There are however specific problems involved in maintaining andassisting industry in the more scattered communities.     Experience has shownthat an advisory and training service is of the greatest value in assistingsmall enterprises in areas distant from urban centres.30.     In the Highlands and Islands the Highland Development Board with thepowers available to it should be able to encourage the development and expansionof small industries and provide the necessary advice and help.     For the restthe need for considerable strengthening of the advisory services provided byScottish Cjuntry Industries Development Trust has already been recognised, andthe Trust is now in process of re-organisation.     Greater emphasis is being placed on business management, accountancy, technical and marketing advice.At the same time, the procedures for providing assistance from Rural IndustriesLoan Fund have been reviewed.     This should make it easier for the smallbusiness man.Technological Development 31.     Changes in the industrial structure of Scotland of the kind described in this and earlier chapters will themselves bring and are bringing a rise in industrial efficienoy but further expansion and more rapid growth in industry will depend to a very great extent on strengthening the technological base ofthe Scottish industrial effort.     One of the outstanding features of rapid growth industries is their ability to innovate and to make use of the resultsof scientific research and development.     Science-based, firms have this capacity 1 built in&apos; but equally important results can be achieved in any sector of industry where a positive policy of product and process improvement ispursued and supported with adequate design and development capacity.     Agreater emphasis on the speeding up ot technological innovation could contributedirectly and powerfully to self-generating growth in existing Scottishindustry.32.     Direct Government spending represents a large proportion of national expenditure on research and development and in this and other ways, theGovernment exercises considerable influence on the character, spread and pace of industrial research.     The location of Government or other public authorityresearch establishments can have a stimulating effect on economic activity inparticular areas - the establishment of the National Engineering Laboratoryat East Kilbride and the Atomic Energy Authority&apos;s Station at Dounreay - butthe impact of these establishments on technological development on industryin Scotland has been disappointing though both establishments have madeimportant contributions to technological development in other parts of the.

United Kingdom.     It is generally accepted that Government sponsorship ofdevelopment contracts has a more direct effect on technological growth inparticular industries.     The principal directing agency fir civil developmentcontracts is the Ministry of Technology and it is accepted Government policy that, in the course of its general function of guiding and stimulating national industrial research and development, the Ministry will seek to support projects which can contribute specially to regional industrial growth.     Indeed it isa particular task of the Ministry&apos;s strengthened regional organisation to beon the lookout for promising projects for development contracts.     ButGovernment readiness to invest in promising projects of this kind must be matched by initiative from private industry in seeking out the ideas for technical advances and taking them to the point at which the case for public support can be effectively examined.     Only firms which have the capacity toundertake development work can be considered for such contracts.     technological-logical development requires at the minimum a design and development staff andmay necessitate the co-operative effort of academic, Government and industrial research and development laboratories to produce the desired results.     TheMinistry of Technology is anxious to stimulate co-operation of this kind, forwhich there is ample scope in Scotland.     An outstanding example is the research and development project initiated by a Scottish industrial firm in association with the Atomic Energy Authority, on the multi-stage flashdistillation process of desalination.33.     There is a small but steadily growing list of firms, many of themhousehold names, whose complement of graduates and other technologicallyqualified staff engaged on research and development work is impressive.Nevertheless, in spite of this growth, the evidence is that the presentdeployment of scientific and technological manpower in Scottish industrycompares unfavourably, in some cases very markedly so, with the corresponding figures for England and Vales.     This is clearly brought out in Table   J7.As is shown in Chapter XII, this is not a reflection of a shortage of scientists and technologists qualifying in Scotland:    a very high proportion of those who do so qualify make their way to England and elsewhere for employment.     But itis a reflection of lack of opportunities and career prospects in Scotland forqualified people both in production and industrial research.34.     Against this background, the Planning Council have set themselves the task of stimulating the interest of manufacturing industry in modernisation and innovation.     To an important extent, this is a process Df encouraging theapplication of existing know-how, of making fuller use of existing facilitieswherever they may be located but particularly local facilities such as theNational Engineering Laboratory.     The appointment by the Ministry of technology of a Senior Regional Officer in Scotland and the IndustrialLiaison Officers appointed by the University of Strathclyde and the central institutions clearly reflect Government interest in this field.     But ifindustry in Scotland is to be fully competitive in home and world markets,and keep up with technological advance there can be no doubt it must employ alarger percentage of qualified men in product and process development andvigorously pursue innovation.     The Council is examining particular fields inwhich further significant developments are possible.     For example, theNational Engineering Laboratory is in the process of building up a majoreffort in the application of numerical control to manufacturing processes andin the use of computers to assist design - new techniques of immense potential.In the Council&apos;s view, there is now a real opportunity to harness the resourcesof particular sections of Scottish industry to research amid development pro-grammes undertaken both by the Government research establishments and universities.7.

Q  f* O6 3 635.     The Counoil stresses the key factor of the involvement of private industry in the processes of technological advancement.     The full value of progress in scientific research will not be realised and the conversion ofthe results of research into more efficient processes, new products and higherproduction and sales will not be accomplished without the full participation of industry itself.     The industries in Scotland which could make majorcontributions to economic growth are readily identifiable - chemicals,electronics, machine tools and electrical and mechanical engineering are allin this group - and within these broad categories, an attempt will be made to define specific areas in which industrial research ana development could beexpected to achieve special prominence.     There will certainly be new marketsto challenge us:   bio-engineering, computer science, the whole field ofelectronically-supported mechanical engineering, building materials,electricity supply and plastics are examples of fields which may hold excitingpossibilities for modern Scottish industry.     The gradual evolution of a newpattern of science-based and technically advanced industry is possible and scotland may be well placed now to achieve again the prominence that wasearned in an earlier industrial revolution by native skill and ingenuity.8.

introduction. The commitment to a planned expansion of the National Economy anda 25 per cent increase in national output by 1970; the decision to improve thearrangements for providing incentives for industrial investment; and the sub-stantial increase made in public investment and in approved industrial projects in Scotland itself in 1965; these have created the necessary conditions for a fundamental change in Scotland\s future economic prospects. This White Papersurveys the prospects in the next five years. It sets out a comprehensive range of economic and physical objectives for growth and expansion.2. The Government are determined that these objectives the creation ofmore jobs, the provision of more homes, the modernisation of the industrial structure, the improvement of the physical environment, the reduction of the outward flow of young people from all regions of Scotland  will be achieved.Their attainment will however require changes of many kinds; changes of attitude, changes of job, changes of place of work, and changes in outlook by many of the leading forces in Scotland industry and industrial management,organised labour, the local authorities and other agencies and individuals inevery walk of life.3. The programme set out in this Paper covers the whole of Scotland andthe whole economy of Scotland. It contains an inter-related set of proposals forattacking all these problems. It will not, of course, be possible to achieve com-plete solutions within the relatively short period covered by the present pro-gramme; the difficulties are too deepseated and too longstanding for that. Thenext five years are however critical. Indeed in some areas action in terms of this white Paper must be taken without delay, for example in the Borders; otherwise it may be too late.4. The programme at this stage is necessarily an outline only; there must be full discussions with all the agencies concerned about the details of its imple-mentation. Nor can any such programme succeed unless the proposals command the support of the mass of those affected up and down the country. The Govern-ment therefore propose to set up effective machinery to implement the pro-gramme contained in this White Paper. This will be based upon the new organisation which they established to advise the Secretary of State for scotland as the Minister responsible for regional development in Scotland.5. The Scottish Economic Planning Council, who have been closely concernedwith the preparation of the present proposals, will now enter into consultation,area by area, with the interests affected in the various regions by the outlineproposals. This will cover the various industrial organisations, including those concerned with agriculture, forestry, and fishing as appropriate, the nationalised industries, the trade unions, the local authorities and the chambers of commerce.The most suitable machinery for this purpose is now being worked out with theCouncil.6. In any event a great deal of responsibility must rest with the local authoritieswhose duty it is to provide the basic services and look after the physical and

social aspects of the developments envisaged in the White Paper. Suitablegroupings of interested authorities will be essential in relation to various formsof communications and the development of key points of expansion. TheSecretary of State welcomes the fact that, in anticipation of this White Paper,local consultations about such groupings have already been initiated in some areas by the local authorities and other interests concerned.7. The main proposals in this White Paper are summarised on pages 00.

SummaryPART I ECONOMIC RESOURCES AND PROSPECTS1. The Governments plans for Scotland are designed to create more employ-ment opportunities so as to take up, in the widest national interest, the availablereserves of labour, and to reduce emigration. The increase in the number of jobs contemplated by 1970 is of the order of 50-60,000; this would be accom-panied by a reduction in net loss of population to about 20,000 a year. Sincesubstantial losses in some of the older industries can be expected, this wouldinvolve the creation of at least 130,000 new jobs. Of these, some 50,000 mightbe found in manufacturing industry, 20,000 in construction industry, and 55,000in other service industries.Labour Supply2. Efficiency of labour deployment will continue to be developed by meansof the following:(a) Changes from one industry to another, facilitated by effective redundancyand wage related benefit payments and by training and re-trainingarrangements;(b) Continued assistance in labour mobility from area to area by linking new housing with industrial growth and by the full development of presentschemes of financial assistance to transferred key workers; and(c) The co-operation of employers and trade unions in securing the betteruse of skilled labour and increasing the inter-changeability and flexibility in the use of skills.3. Under the Industrial Training Act, 1964, the amount of industrial training will continue to be expanded and its quality improved. Forecasts of the demandfor particular types of skill will be made. Financial assistance towards trainingin new and expanding firms is increasing as is the help given to employers intraining their own training officers.4. In the field of management development the main responsibility rests with industry. There will be continuing assistance to the universities and other institutions where management training is given. The Central Training Counciland the Industrial Training Boards will play an increasingly important part.Manufacturing industry. The Government have announced that they are reviewing the GovernmentsDistribution of Industry powers and policies and intend to take measures tosupport much more effectively the wider aim of regional development. Govern-ment action will include the advance purchase of land for industrial development by the Board of Trade, and the building of advance factories in selected areasboth by the Board of Trade and by New Town Development Corporations.

Measures to divert industrial expansion from the congested areas of theMidlands and the South-East of England will continue to be applied rigorously.These are producing impressive results in steering industry elsewhere; in Scotlanditself industrial building approvals were at a higher level in 1965 than in anyother post-war year. The Government will give all possible help toward meetingScotland&apos;s need for adequate shares of the newer industries and of research and development activities, both by steering suitable projects to Scotland andby expanding their own activities in co-operation with industry and the universities at the National Engineering Research Laboratory, East Kilbride.and elsewhere.Agriculture and Forestry7. Agriculture will make its contribution through a selective expansion pro-gramme, accompanied by a continued increase in productivity which will enable it to release manpower to other industries. The Government have authorised the Forestry Commission to increase their planting programme for the benefitof areas where forestry is an essential element in creating a viable economy.Service Industries and Tourism8. Continued expansion of the service industries, including ollice employmentnot directly catering for local needs, will have a significant part to play in development. Special attention will be given to tourism, which has potentiallya considerable part to play in the future economy of some of the more rural areas.PART II-THE PHYSICAL PATTERN OF GROWTH AND EXPANSIONCentral Scotland9. In Central Scotland substantial developments are proposed to cater forthe increased population resulting from the reduction of migration, and tosupport industrial expansion often in new locations. Typical areas include NorthAyrshire, Lanarkshire and Falkirk/Grangemouth. Development in the fourestablished new towns will go ahead as rapidly as possible and it is hoped thatthe growth potential in this field will be further enhanced by the setting up in theIrvine area of a fifth new town which the Government propose to designate atan early date.

In the EasternBorders the Development Commission will put in hand special methods ofassistance, financial and administrative, to stimulate new growth and other

activity in the area so as to provide a better environment and to arrestdepopulation.South-VVest Scotland11. The Government have embarked on an examination of the potentialities of the water resources of the Solway Area and will consider with the localauthorities the further development of districts like Dumfries and Stranraer.North-East Scotland12. Expansion of population and industry will be encouraged in Dundee andits hinterland, and in Aberdeen and other selected centres in the North-East.Highlands and Islands13. A number of proposals are being examined by the Highlands and IslandsDevelopment Board who have already introduced a scheme of special financialassistance for suitable industrial developments. The increased programme ofplanting by the Forestry Commission will be of particular significance in thispart of Scotland.PART III-SUPPORTING SERVICESHousing14. The Government will initiate a substantial programme of housing insupport of economic and industrial growth through the agency of the scottish special Housing Association. Up to 5,000 houses a year will be provided forthis purpose by 1970. The new towns will also build about 5,000 houses a year.Under the improved financial arrangements outlined in the recent White paper on Housing,* the Government will encourage local authorities to provide morehouses and a wider range of housing to promote increased labour mobility.More land will be made available for private housing development in view of its importance in improving the management structure of Scottish industry.Education15. The Governments plans for expansion of education facilities in scotland will be pressed forward. Total capital investment will rise from  24m. in 1965to nearly  34m. in 1970, including an increase of nearly 51 per cent on theconstruction of colleges of further education. This will enable many more newcolleges to be built, including a new commercial college in Dundee, new com-mercial and technical colleges in Edinburgh, and similar facilities in Glasgow and* Cmnd. 2837.

Communications16. (i) Roads.  137m. will be spent by the Exchequer on the Scottish road programme in the years 1965-70  S2m. on trunk roads and motor-ways and  55m. on grants for classified roads. This will produce a completely modernised system of communications throughout thecentral industrial belt in Scotland, linking with the main motorwaynetwork in England and Wales. By 1970 the Clyde Tunnel approacheswill have been completed and good progress will have been madewith the Glasgow inner ring road, including the completion of theCarnoustie Street bridge; the Tay Bridge will have been completed;over 200 miles of motorway or near motorway standard roads,including the motorway access to Abbotsinch, will have been com-pleted in Central Scotland and the Erskine Bridge will be nearing completion; work will have been initiated on the major approaches tothe Highlands and on improvements to through routes to the North-East, South-West and Border regions. The greatest importance willbe placed on using highway investment to help to support economic growth.(ii) Road Transport Services. These services will expand and become more efficient. As regards passenger transport, realistic balances must be struck between public services and the use of private cars for dailycommuting. In the greater Glasgow area, this is now being examined in a comprehensive transportation survey, the results of which areexpected shortly.(iii) Rail Services. The future pattern of the modernised railway system isnow emerging, and further investment in railway modernisation is inhand or is planned. This includes the electrification of the GlasgowGourock line; the full development of liner trains between Scotlandand England; and the complete rationalisation of the depot system formiscellaneous freight traffic, with concentration on facilities for keypoints. New signalling facilities are being provided on an extensive scale.(iv) Ports and Shipping Services. Substantial investment has already beenapproved or is in prospect: at Leith ( 6m.), at Grangemouth ( 7m.)and on the Clyde. The Government expect the new Clyde Authorityto give urgent consideration to the National Ports CounciPs views onmodernising the Clyde Port.(v) Airports and Air Services. Abbotsinch Airport will come into operation in May, 1966. A substantial programme of improving landing facilities in the Highlands and Islands has been launched improved runwaysat Kirkwall, Sumburgh and Port Ellen, and landing strips in Mull,the Orkneys and elsewhere. Applications for the provision of direct airlinks with the Continent by various operators are before the air transport Licensing Board.other towns in Central Scotland. Building methods will be streamlined to enableinvestment to be better deployed in coping with the educational needs of an expanding population.

(vi) Telecommunications. Despite a 70 per cent increase in demand in1964/65 over the two previous years, new plant coming forwardshould make the waiting list for telephone negligible by March, 1966:and it is hoped that all manual exchanges will be automatic by 1970.Capital expenditure for the telephone service will have almost doubledover the five years to 1967, and will continue to increase thereafter.Except for a few remote areas, all subscribers in Scotland will haveS.T.D. by 1970.(vii) Fuel and Power. Demand in Scotland is expected to develop at a slightly higher rate than in the rest of Great Britain up to 1970. The total demand in that year may be 31m. tons of coal equivalent, as comparedwith 26-6m. in 1964.The present annual output of deep-mined coal in Scotland is about15m. tons; further colliery closures and substantial improvements in productivity will lead to continuing reductions in man-power but theindustry will remain able to meet any likely level of demand in theScottish market.The demand for^/.v has increased substantially in recent years andis expected to expand by almost a further 50 per cent by 1970. an increasing proportion of the production will come from oil-basedsources. Electricity demand is expected to increase by about 9 per cent per annum, the bulk of which will be met by the new large power stations at Cockenzie and Longannet and supported by pumpedstorage facilities at Cruachan.The use of oil in Scotland has been expanding significantly andrefining capacity has been increased. There is scope for furtherrefinery development.Construction Industries17. The current output of these industries is estimated at  350m. with theemployment of 200,000 workers. By 1970, output (at 1964 prices) is likely to expand to nearly  500m., as a result of increased productivity (including new methods of building) and of further expansion of the labour force. Closeconsideration is being given to improving the flow of skilled workers to theindustry. The Scottish Economic Planning Council have embarked on detailedstudies of the demand for building materials and components, and will consider how their production can be expanded in Scotland.Investment18. Public investment will continue until 1969/70 at a rate which, relative topopulation, will be above that of the United Kingdom generally. Over theperiod from 1965/66 to 1969/70 Scottish public investment will rise considerablyand will total approximately  2,000m.

Part I.   Economic Resources and ProspectsChapter 1POPULATION AND ECONOMIC RESOURCES1. The National Plan is designed to achieve a 25 per cent increase in national output between 1964 and 1970. An essential part of the Plan is a solution to britain&apos;s balance of payments problem; for growth can be maintained only ifwe pay our way in the world. The target for the growth of total national output is expressed in that Plan in terms of two factors; the required rate of growth of output per head (in other words, productivity) and the probable rate of growth of the labour force. This chapter reviews the performance of the Scottisheconomy in recent years in relation both to increased productivity and the rateof growth of the labour force while Chapter II goes on to set out the main objectives which must be attained in the future if Scotland is to make its full contribution both to national growth and to the achievement of a more balancedand progressively expanding economy in Scotland itself.Population and Migration2. The most significant feature of the Scottish population pattern is the relatively high rate of natural increase in comparison with the corresponding increase for England and Wales (Table 1). In the 10 years between 1954 and1964 the rate of increase in total population as measured by excess of birthsover deaths was 7-1 per cent, proportionately 36 per cent larger than inEngland and Wales.3. The relatively higher rate of natural increase in the population and in the potential labour force in Scotland has, however, been largely offset by netemigration. Net emigration represents the balance between numbers of personsmoving from Scotland and into it. The process of movement between Scotlandand other parts of the United Kingdom, and indeed other parts of the world,is a necessary and, in many respects, a healthy feature, but in recent years the gap between movement out and movement in has widened substantially. Inthe last ten years the balance of population Most&apos; to Scotland by net emigrationhas been about 300,000 people or over 80 per cent of the natural increase. Ineach of the years 1963-64 and 1964-65 the net outward movement was about40,000 and this almost totally absorbed the natural increase of population.4. If the net outward movement were to continue at this level, Scotland^population in 1980 would be no higher than it is now (Table 5). Even moreimportant, the number of people of working age (males 15-65, females 15-60)would have fallen from nearly 61 per cent of the total population to about 55per cent. This means that there would be 274,000 fewer people of working age;118,000 more old people; and 156,000 more children. The raising of the school leaving age and the increase in the numbers aged over 16 in full-time educationwould reduce still further the number actually available for work.

5. Although the volume of net emigration from Scotland in recent years hasbeen so high, there are no grounds for pessimism or defeatism about thepossibility of reducing it, given a sustained rate of economic growth. Thefluctuations in the 1950*s (the net outward movement was as low as 20,000 in1958-59) suggest that there is no built-in inevitability either about the volumeof inward and outward migration or about its trends. Moreover, since it is anet figure representing the difference between very much larger outward andinward movements, a comparatively modest adjustment of the two figures ofoutward and inward migration could produce really significant changes in thenet figure (Table 4 gives gross movements of employees).6. There is little factual information on the motives of migrants. They are undoubtedly complex and varied, since they are the sum of each individuatesassessment of the advantages and disadvantages to him of moving or of stayingwhere he is. But they are clearly linked to work and career prospects, to levels of earnings, and to environment. Emigration has been generally high when therate of economic development elsewhere has been much faster than in Scotland.For example, emigration to the developing countries (especially Canada) wasvery high in the 1920s. In recent years the biggest loss has been to Englandand Wales (Table 3) reflecting the better opportunities south of the Border but there are indications that prospects for professional and technical staff arcimproving in Scotland and that the inward flow of these is more closely matchingthe outflow.7. Within Scotland, different parts of the country have substantially different rates of natural increase in population and of outward migration. The rate of natural increase, for example, is particularly high in west Central Scotland hutlow in the Borders and the Highlands (Table 2). Net outward migration is nowhighest from west Central Scotland not only absolutely but also proportionately(Fig. 1 and Table 3). England and Wales take about two-thirds of the netoutward movement from Scotland as a whole and on average less than a fifth of the total net migration from the North-East, Highlands, Borders and South-West now moves into Central Scotland.8. Nevertheless if outward migration from Scotland were to continue on itspresent scale, with expansion in Central Scotland alone, the imbalance between that region and the other Scottish regions would increase; in other words,people would move from the rural areas into the industrial belt in response tothe increasing demand for labour there. It is for this reason that the measuresoutlined in this White Paper relate the major effort which will be required in central Scotland to the Scottish economy as a whole and seek to establish a balanced relationship between Central Scotland and the other regions.9. The great majority of the people who move are in the younger age groups and such evidence as is available indicates that it is the more highly skilled and the more technically qualified rather than the unskilled who migrate.Increasing educational opportunities and the higher proportion of young people who are taking up craft apprenticeships and technical and other courses areexpanding substantially the potential supply in Scotland of high quality labour.It is therefore a critical aim of Government policy that there should be moreemployment and better career opportunities to keep more of our young people in Scotland.

Figure net migration from and within Scotland 1961-196421-8This diagram illustrates paragraph 5 and Table 3. Numbers are in thousands,independently rounded. It shows that Central Scotland is the biggest migrationloser; and that the Borders, the South-West, the North-East and the highlands and Islands lose more people to the rest of the U.K. and overseas than to central scotland.

Labour Resources10. Between 1954 and 1964 the natural increase of the population of Scotland was over 7 per cent but, because of the high net emigration, the actual increasein population was only 1-3 per cent (Table 1). The change in the age structurelargely offset the rise in the activity rate* and the increase in the supply of employees was only 1-4 per cent (Table 6). In terms of numbers of employees in employment Scotland\s increase over the ten years was only 0-S per cent asagainst an increase of 9-9 percent in England and Wales (Table 8). The potentialincrease in the Scottish employed labour force was either siphoned off inemigration or wasted in unemployment or sterilised in lower employee activityrates.* The unemployment rate in Scotland between 1954 and 1964 ranged from1-8 to 2-3 times the average rate for Great Britain (Table 7), while activityrates were below the Great Britain averages although markedly above those for areas such as South-West England or Wales (Table 9). In 1964 the activityrate in Scotland was 56-5 per cent as against 57-1 per cent in Great Britain asa whole.Structure of the EconomyII. The reason for this lack of growth in employment was that the natural increase added to the large numbers released by the run down of the oldindustries, made more workers available than could be absorbed even by the rapid growth of the new and expanding industries. As world economic conditionschanged Scottish industry paid the penalty for specialisation in what wasbasically a 19th century industrial structure and drastic modernisation of theindustrial structure became necessary. This was not simply a run down of the capacity of older heavy industries: the need was for increased efficiency and productivity and lower costs. For example, productivity in the Scottish coalfield,as measured by output per man shift, has increased by as much as 36 per centin the last five years.12. But the process did involve reductions in employment, if not always in output, and in the last four years the old Scottish basic industries of mining and quarrying, shipbuilding and textiles have lost 50,000 workers. Even the big increases in both male and female employment in the same period in industries new, or almost new, to Scotland such as motor vehicles, electronics,electrical engineering and scientific instruments could not entirely offset suchrapid and large losses of predominantly male employment opportunities. Infact the small overall increase in total employment in Scotland in the last 10years masks an increase in jobs for women which was mainly offset by a fallin the total jobs available for men (Table 8). So the need is for still more new projects preferably with substantial male employment which by their devclop-ment will counter the decline in the employment opportunities afforded by someof the older industries.13. in the last four years employment in the primary industries in scotland has fallen by nearly a fifth, but has been more than offset by gains in professional and scientific services, construction and the distributive trades. Almost as many* The term activity rate, as used throughout this Paper, refers to the numbers of employees(including the registered unemployed) expressed as percentages of the home population aged15 or over. Broadly, a 1 per cent change in the total (male and female) activity rate representsin Scotland a change of about 39,000 in the number of employees (including the unemployed).

people are now employed in the manufacture of motor vehicles, electricalmachinery and radio and electronic apparatus in Scotland as in the whole ofthe Scottish shipbuilding and marine engineering industries. So while the olderbasic industries such as coal, iron and steel, will continue to have very importantplaces in the economy, the growth of the new industries means that the countryis no longer so dependent on the fortunes of a narrow range of heavy industries.Further contractions in employment in some of the older industries must come before they are finally re-shaped to fit their new and smaller role in the economy but the process of contraction will not be on as massive a scale asin the recent past, will be accompanied by increasing technical efficiency and higher productivity, and will be increasingly outweighed by further developmentof the expanding industries to which labour, skill and investment have been and are being transferred. This is readily seen by comparing the rates of increasein manufacturing output in Scotland and in the United Kingdom. From 1954to 1960 Scottish output increased by only 2-4 per cent per annum against theUnited Kingdom rate of 3-4 per cent per annum; but for 1960 to 1964 manu-facturing industries in Scotland equalled the United Kingdom average annual increase of 3-1 per cent.14. Although no comprehensive figures are available of the capital investmentinvolved in reshaping the industrial structure. Board of Trade estimates ofcapital expenditure by manufacturing establishments in Scotland indicate atotal of  506 million over the five years 1960 to 1964, of which  116 million was on new building work and  390 million on plant, machinery and vehicles.These years included the major parts of the expenditure on such projects asthe strip mill and the new motor vehicle plants, and the total represented nearly9 per cent of the total fixed capital expenditure by manufacturing industry inthe United Kingdom as a whole. This compared with Scotland^ 8 1 per cent of employment in United Kingdom manufacturing in 1964. Board of Tradeassistance to Scotland under the Local Employment Acts has amounted to 69-4 million in the last five years 49-2 per cent of the total assistance offered in Great Britain. Investment by the nationalised industries in Scotland (includingthe Post Office) in the same period has totalled over  465 million of whichnearly  260 million has been by the Electricity Boards.15. Scotland has the particular advantage of a high rate of natural increasein population. She also has reserves of labour open in high unemployment,and concealed in that activity rates are considerably below those in the moreprosperous regions south of the Border. Given the right incentives to industry,co-ordinated regional economic planning by public authorities, and positiveinitiatives in terms of capital, management and manpower, and still further increases in productivity, a much larger contribution by the Scottish economy to national growth by 1970 should be possible. The steps necessary to achieve this expansion are set out in the following chapters.

The steps necessary to achieve this expansion are set out in the following chapters.

Chapter 11OBJECTIVES FOR THE FUTURE16. The National Plan has indicated that the supply of labour availablenationally in the Plan period from 1964 to 1970 is likely to fall substantiallyshort of the labour demand which a progressively expanding growth rate on the25 per cent model would require. The shortfall is estimated in that Plan to beof the order of 400,000 for the national economy as a whole; the gap can bebridged only by higher productivity throughout the economy and by theoptimum deployment of under-used labour and other resources in those regions of the United Kingdom where growth has lagged behind. The Plan estimatedthat the fuller use of regional resources might provide a total addition to theworking labour force of about 200.000. This chapter assesses the contribution which Scotland might make to the national and regional policies set out in theNational Plan and what is needed to create a better balance of population andemployment within Scotland itself.17. In order to ensure the optimum deployment of Scotland&apos;s labour reserves,it is necessary to bring employment opportunities in Scotland more closely in line with those in other parts of Great Britain. This will result not only in lowerunemployment rates and higher activity rates, but also in a reduction of netpopulation loss by migration. The task involved is analysed in the present chapteron the basis that the net annual loss would, by 1970, be reduced to half its present level. This must be accompanied by, and will not occur without, a substantial increase in industrial modernisation and productivity and a rise in production.Progressive modernisation and expansion of the services to support economic growth housing, communications, schools, etc. will be needed. There must also be policies and measures to tap the unused resources in manpower, land,and other facilities available in those parts of Scotland that lie outside the centralindustrial belt.18. It is unrealistic to think in terms of an impressive reduction in the outwardHow of large numbers of people from Scotland unless, in addition to morejobs and better career prospects, houses and other services are available for themin Scotland in the right places and at the right time. Again, activity rates arelinked with migration of the present scale and character, as is the volume and quality of skilled manpower and management available to accelerate the processof modernisation and change in Scottish industry.19. For all these reasons, the present chapter and those which follow are intended to provide a composite and interdependent scheme of policies and action. The purpose of the present chapter however is to deal particularly withthe deployment of under-used labour resources and the reduction of net emigra-tion. It attempts to estimate the likely changes in the supply of, and demand for,labour in Scotland between now and 1970. The projections made take accountof the basic objectives for the United Kingdom as a whole set out in the national plan and the rates of growth and decline in labour demand, output and pro-productivity expected in the major sectors of the economy. These projections will, ofcourse, be subject to review in the light of discussions to be held in 1966 in relationto the next National Plan.Labour Supply and Demand20. The assessment of labour supply in Scotland over a period even as short

as five years is particularly difficult. The effect of national policies on the relativepressure of labour demand in Scotland itself and elsewhere, the level of activity and the volume and character of outward and inward migration are all inter-acting, and it is a matter of great complexity to estimate with any degree ofaccuracy the probable combined effect of all these factors on Scottish labour supply. Subject to this general reservation, the following general estimate hasbeen made of the additional labour resources which might become available tosupport expansion and growth in the Scottish economy down to 1970. these estimates take account of the objectives of policy set out in paragraph 2 and ofthe assumptions and forecasts made in the National Plan.21. A progressive reduction of net emigration to half its current level by 1970would mean that Scotland&apos;s home population at that date would be about-3m., or just over 100,000 more than it was at mid-1964. Changes in the popula-tion structure, however, would mean that, despite this increase in population,the number of people in Scotland available for employment would not increase to anything like the same extent. The main additions to the employed labour force would come from higher activity rates and lower unemployment. the build-up of extra demand for labour of which there is good evidence in recentScottish trends and the Governments regional development policies givegrounds for confidence that it will be possible, bearing in mind the accompanyingreduction in net emigration, to employ in Scotland greater numbers than wereprojected (on the basis of U.K. trends) in the National Plan. There is no reasonto think that, if demand for labour rose by 50-60,000 by 1970, this demandcould not be met.22. This additional labour demand would involve the operation of two majorforces first, the sustained and progressive expansion implicit in the national plan for the national economy as a whole, of which the Scottish economy is an integral part; secondly, intensification of effort both by Government and by allother elements of the Scottish economy to achieve higher rates of growth and higher standards of economic performance within Scotland itself. TheGovernments regional policies will make their contribution to the expansion oflabour demand in Scotland, and the estimate of demand is framed on this basis.23. Table A sets out, by reference to the main sectors of Scottish industry,projected rates of increase in production, employment and output per headwhich have been made in the light of the corresponding projections for these industries in the United Kingdom as a whole contained in the National Plan.Particular attention has been paid to those industrial sectors in Scotland which,on the basis of recent past performances and future prospects, should haveeither a higher rate of growth than the national average or present special prob-lems. The estimates of labour demand for all industries and services are set outin Table B.24. The main lessons to be drawn from these tables arc the following. Whilethe primary industries are likely to make a significant contribution to nationalgrowth in terms of output per head they will in Scotland show the samecharacteristics as they do for the United Kingdom as a whole, namely a declinein manpower employed. In manufacturing industry on the other hand, it isexpected that the national rate of growth in output envisaged in the national plan for the period 1964-70 (4-4 per cent) will be slightly exceeded in Scotland.The food, drink and tobacco group of industries, chemicals, engineering,

vehicles and the building material industries should in Scotland all have rates of growth higher than the Scottish average of 4-6 per cent. These fast growthindustries in terms of output should more than compensate for reduced activity in the now reduced range of older declining industries.table aIndex of Production Industries	1960-64		per annum compound 1964-70 projections (a)		U.K. (b)	Scotland (c)	U.K. (b)	Scotland (c)A U Index of Production Industries				Production   ....	3-3	3-3	4-5	4-8Employment ....	0-2	-0-3	0-4	0-4Output per head	31	3-6	41	4-4A ianufaciuring industries				Production   ....	31	31	4-4	4-6Employment ....	01	0-6	0-5	0-6Output per head	3 0	3-6	3-9	4 0Construction				Production   ....	5 0	5-6	4-6	5-8Employment ....	1-3	1-8	0-9	1-6Output per head	3-6	3-8	3-7	4 gas, Electricity and Water			-	Production   ....	5-6	8-3	8-4	8-4Employment ....	20	2-7	1-7	1-8Output per head	3-6	5-5	6-5	6-5Mining and Quarrying				Production   ....	0-4	-3-3	 	-0-employment ....	-3-7	-7-3	-5-1	-6-8Output per head	4-2	4-4	5-4	6-7(a) All the projections are necessarily subject to considerable margins of error and should therefore be regarded asapproximations.(b) As given in the National Plan.

It is estimated that all industries and services in Scotland will have a net increase in labour demand averaging about 10.000 a year over the period to1970, which is 2,500 a year larger than the average net growth in labour demandduring 1960-64. But the net increase in the demand for manpower for Scotlanddoes not show the true scale of the changes which will be called for. underlying the total net demand of between 50,000 and 6)0,000 additional jobs down to1970 are far larger increases in labour demand in the growing industries offset byconsiderable falls in labour demand in the declining industries. Herein lies the hard core of the problem facing the Scottish economy. A diminishing labourdemand in the contracting industries is unavoidable and, indeed, essential if the economy is to be modernised and made more efficient. An increasing demand inthe growing industries cannot however be achieved without continuing purposiveand vigorous efforts by industry and by Government in Scotland which is stillgoing through a process of transformation and change. This applies particularly to manufacturing industry where the policies and measures outlined in the subsequent chapters of this Paper will have the greatest significance, althoughconstruction and the service industries will also benefit substantially.

c3 j26. Table B estimates that those industries where expansion of employment is forecast, assuming a 25 per cent growth of output in the national economy andthe determined application of the Governments regional policies, are likely torequire, in all, over 130,000 more workers by 1970. Within this total the mainincreases will be of the order of 50,000 in manufacturing industry; 20,000 inconstruction; and 60,000 in professional and scientific services, distribution andother services administration. This estimate for manufacturing industry is supported by the large volume of employment expected to flow directly from industrial development certificates issued, particularly in the last 12 months.Table BEmployees in employment, all industries and services (a)	Thousands				Period %	Approx /o p.a.

These increases, which clearly will require a formidable effort by allelements in the economy, would be partly offset by job losses of the order of atleast 75,000, the majority of which would be due to modernisation and technological-logical change, and, in particular, to higher efficiency in agriculture, coal-mining,transport services, and certain sectors of the textile industry. These changesbroadly reflect both the changes in the national economy outlined in the national plan, and the most recent developments in Scottish economic conditions. Innone of the sectors of industry where employment is likely to contract would the

rate of contraction be expected to be as heavy or as rapid as it has been in scotland in the past.Conclusion28. The objectives of economic planning policies in Scotland must be to achieve faster rates of growth in output and higher productivity throughout the economy and, particularly, more employment opportunities in the expandingsectors of industry. Higher productivity is the only means of securing a more competitive position in world markets and faster rates of growth in outputwhich will lead to more and lasting employment opportunities. In the long run,higher productivity and higher employment go hand in hand. Only in this waycan existing reserves of labour be more fully deployed, unemployment reduced and higher levels of activity achieved, and the necessary reduction in outwardmigration secured to provide a stable population structure for the Scottisheconomy by 1970 and beyond. The National Plan provides the framework withinwhich progressive national growth and expansion can be secured: the proposalswhich follow in the succeeding chapters of this Paper are designed to enableScotland to make its maximum contribution to these national objectives and.at the same time, provide a basis for the modernisation and progressive expansionof the Scottish economy.

c3 chapter 111LABOUR SUPPLY29. The economic objectives for Scotland, outlined in the preceding chapter namely, faster rates of growth, higher productivity and more employment opportunities depend on the full and efficient deployment of labour. this chapter describes the labour reserves and the pattern of skills available inScotland, and goes on to outline the action now being taken and being developed to deploy these reserves and skills to the best advantage. The vital part to be played by training and management is considered in Chapter IV and the keyrole of education is examined in Chapter XII.Reserves of Manpower30. The under-employment of Scottish labour resources has taken the visibleform of relatively high unemployment rates and the more latent form of loweractivity rates (Tables 7 and 9).31. As mentioned in Chapter I, Scotland&apos;s rate of unemployment has, overthe past decade, remained at about twice the national rate. The distribution ofunemployment has been uneven, most of it concentrated in the industrial areasof the Central Belt. In parts of the Highlands and Islands, the South West and,to a lesser extent, in the North-East, unemployment is more widely dispersedand there are isolated pockets, much of it of a seasonal nature. Special problemsare involved in the reduction of unemployment in these areas even in conditionsof a generally high demand. Most unemployed men are unskilled 65 per centin Scotland in June, 1965, compared with 56 per cent in Great Britain as a whole.On the other hand, Scotland&apos;s unemployed reserves contain proportionatelyfewer persons over 45 years old and fewer disabled, than Great Britain as awhole. In a survey carried out in October, 1964, of the Scottish unemployed, itwas estimated that almost 20,000 out of 46,000 male unemployed could beplaced without difficulty if jobs were available. But this docs not represent thefull potential from this source and further demand, stimulated by progressiveeconomic growth, could result in still further deployment of these labourreserves.32. It will be noted from Table 9 that the male employee activity rate inScotland was 78-1 per cent in 1954, well above the Great Britain rate of 76-9 percent. The Scottish rate however dropped to 76-5 per cent by 1964, and was thenbelow the rate of 76-7 per cent for Great Britain. This relative fall is partly areflection of the heavy loss of younger men from Scotland by emigration.Activity rates of women present a more encouraging picture during the period1954-64, rising from 36-3 percent to 38-8 per cent, a figure just below the GreatBritain average. There has been a general tendency throughout Britain for morewomen over 35 to enter employment, but Scotland still lags, particularly in the40-59 age group.Pattern of Skills33. With its long tradition of industries demanding higher skills, Scotland hasa larger proportion of skilled operatives within its male labour force than GreatBritain as a whole. An analysis of the occupational structure of employees in

establishments in manufacturing industry with 11 or more workers showed that,in 1964, 41 per cent were skilled operatives compared with 38 per cent for GreatBritain. The nucleus of craft skill in Scotland could be a major asset in the further expansion of the Scottish labour force. Moreover, a higher proportion of boysenter craft apprenticeships and the number has been increasing. In 1960, 33 percent of all boys entering employment became apprentices; in 1964, 40 per cent.Even so, the number still falls short in some respects of the level regarded as necessary for Scotland&apos;s future needs; for example, the Scottish Committee ofthe Central Training Council has indicated that an increase of 25 per cent in theannual intake of apprentices to the engineering industry is necessary if skilled workers are to be available to meet expected growth in that industry, and theCommittee has brought its findings to the attention of the organisations andfirms concerned. To obtain full benefit from this infusion of young blood,apprentice training facilities must be continuously developed. A major purposeof the Industrial Training Act is to introduce through the industrial trainingboards more systematic, effective and purposeful training for young entrants to industry. Furthermore young craftsmen who have completed their training should be assured of good prospects in their own country and must be en-couraged to remain in Scotland.34. In the engineering sector the labour force in Scotland has 42 per centskilled operatives compared with 38 per cent in Great Britain. This hides thefact, however, that the engineering industry in Scotland has proportionatelymore general fitters and turners and fewer machine setters, setter operators andother skilled machine tool operators, occupations which are in the greatestdemand by the newer industries. There have been shortages in these categoriesin recent months but they have not been nearly so severe as in the South.35. Outside manufacturing the biggest employer of skilled labour is theconstruction industry. In 1964 Scottish contractors employed a larger proportionof craftsmen 62 per cent compared with 60-5 percent in Great Britain generally.Although supply and demand for craftsmen are in rough balance, joiners havebeen difficult to obtain for a long time and bricklayers, plumbers and electriciansare scarce in some areas. Here again, however, it must be emphasised that pressure of demand is less than in the South.36. Another important feature of the Scottish labour force is the lowerproportion of administrative, technical and clerical workers employed in manufacturing industry compared with that in Great Britain as a whole 20 per cent as against 23 per cent. In particular, if one takes the scientists andtechnologists on which much of Scotland&apos;s industrial development and growthmust depend, a paradoxical situation is found, that whereas Scotland producesrelatively more of these qualified men and women than the rest of the country itemploys relatively fewer of them in her industry. She also employs relativelyfewer draughtsmen and technicians. In the faster growing chemical and cngin-eering and electrical industries, substantially fewer scientists and technologistsin proportion were employed in Scotland as in England during 1963/64, andthe contrast with South-East England was particularly marked; even in the traditional textile and metal manufacturing industries they were more weaklyrepresented. Although symptomatic of the fact that much of the design anddevelopment of goods manufactured in Scotland is carried out elsewhere, the deficiency is a measure of the ground that must be made up if the further development of scientific and technological industries in Scotland is to prosper.

There are however already hopeful signs that more young science and engin-eering graduates and technologists are finding scope for their talents at home.37. Overall acceleration of industrial expansion and the rapidly changingindustrial structure have together made new demands on the occupationalresources of Scottish industry. Because of the upsurge in demand for laboursome shortages are emerging at craft, technician and technologist levels, but theseare much less serious than in the South. The Government Training Centres will play an important role in meeting shortages of skilled workers in the short-term and the Industrial Training Boards at all levels of skill and qualifications in the longer term.Earnings38. With this expansion average weekly earnings, for male manual workers,aged 21 and over in manufacturing industry as a whole have increased over thepast five years by 34-2 per cent in Scotland as compared with 31-2 per cent inthe U.K. Individual sectors of industry in which the relative position in scotland has improved include chemicals, metal manufacture, engineering and electricalgoods, clothing and construction. Actual money earnings in Scotland at April1965 were some twenty-five shillings a week below the U.K. average for all industries covered by the Ministry of Labour half yearly enquiry, but in anumber of key growth sectors of engineering weekly earnings were above theU.K. level these were agricultural machinery, office machinery, industrialplant and steel work, other mechanical engineering, watches and clocks, radio and electronics, and electrical machinery. Average weekly hours worked bymale manual workers in engineering and electrical goods were 46-8 comparedwith 46-6 in the U.K.Action to expand and use Scotland&apos;s manpower more fully39. Scotland must realise to the full its reserves of labour and its relativelygreater supply of traditional skills. Firstly, Scotland is drawing more persons from its manpower reserves into employment; and secondly, steps are beingtaken to encourage the mobility and flexibility of those who are employed sothat their skills are properly adapted and developed.40. In addition to the numbers of workers made available by the plannedreduction in net loss due to emigration, Scotland&apos;s employment could expandfurther by recruiting from-(i) the unemployed and (ii) persons not at present inthe employment field, such as married women.(/&quot;) Unemployed41. As mentioned above, the October 1964 survey of the unemployed showed that almost 20,000 men could be readily placed in employment if jobs wereavailable. Many of these would be suitable immediately for skilled or semi-skilled work, or for training in skills. The industries which are contrtacing willcontinue to provide a flow of men who will be absorbed into expanding in-dustries with, where appropriate, training or re-training. Many of the remainder of the unemployed will fill the jobs of unskilled workers in industry who areupgraded to semi-skilled or skilled work. Some of the longer term unemployedwould have difficulty in measuring up to the demands of industry, and industrial rehabilitation facilities arc available to help refit them to modern employment.

There are two units for this purpose at Hillington and Granton which have the capacity to take 2,000 people annually and a third unit is to be located inLanarkshire.(if) Other Reserves42. The second source from which the expanding labour force could bedrawn is from those persons not at present in the employment held. In areas ofreally full employment there is a tendency for activity rates to rise as all thosewho wish to work can do so: more firms should be encouraged to draw on thesereserves by arranging. Tor example, special shifts to suit part-time workers a shave been successfully introduced by many companies. In particular, marriedwomen who wish to work can make a very important contribution to industrial and service employment. In Scotland in 1964, married women formed only45-9 per cent of the female labour force compared with 53-6 per cent in GreatBritain. The extent of the reserves of women in Scotland who could be drawn upon to fill new jobs and the difficulties which may be in the way of their enteringor re-entering employment are being examined in depth in a survey of womeifsemployment based on interviewing a sample of households. Interviews have beencompleted and processing of the results has begun. In the meantime, the Govern-ment have taken the lead in two important fields in their efforts to recruit moremarried women to the teaching profession and to encourage married nurses toreturn to their profession.Adaptability of the Labour Force43. It will not be sufficient however to bring more persons into employment;it will also be necessary to ensure that those in employment adapt to the demandscreated by the change in Scotland from an economy dominated by heavy industries to a more diversified framework. To build up the growing industries withoutwasting resources realised from declining industries requires a willingness onthe part of the worker (i) to change from one industry to another; (ii) to move from one area to another; and (iii) to acquire new skills. The employment exchange service is being strengthened and its organisation improved to enable it to discharge more effectively its function of smoothly aiding changes inemployment.(/) Changing from one industry to another44. It is expected that agriculture, coal mining and railways will continue toshed male labour though at a lesser rate than in recent years. The large majority ofthe men employed in collieries which are closed should be ollered jobs else wherein the Scottish coal industry. The successful redeployment of men from other contracting industries presents special problems in Scotland; in particular therelative isolation and wide dispersal of agricultural employment makes the task of providing fresh opportunities locally more difficult and the provision of newjob opportunities in isolated mining communities requires special attention.Adequate training and re-training facilities arc of prime importance. It is also important that movements from firms with surplus labour should be encouraged to meet the expanding needs of new and growing firms. The new government measures to alleviate the effects of redundancy will help in this. These are the redundancy Payments Act which will provide for payments to workers whobecome redundant and the proposed scheme of earnings-related unemployment

benefit. The existence of a high level of demand for labour, and confidence thatit will be maintained, will also encourage workers to change jobs to meet theneeds of the new and growing industries.(ii) Moving from one area to another45. Movement of workers from one industry to another will, in many cases,mean movement from one area to another. New and wider patterns of travel towork will emerge, but it will also involve movements of people to new homes.In this connection, a particular feature in Scotland is the uneven geographical distribution of the labour force, more than 60 per cent of the male labour forcein manufacturing being concentrated into the west Central belt. To relieve the congestion there and to assist in the creation of new industrial complexes, more people are being encouraged to move into new towns and overspill areas wherefaster industrial growth and high standards of social amenities are possible. Thesuccess of this redistribution and the pace at which it can grow will depend onaction taken by the Government and by industry. Government intends to playits part by ensuring the careful phasing of the housing and other infrastructureservices, and the measures which it is taking and proposals to this end will bediscussed in detail in later chapters. Industry, on the other hand, is helping and can do more to help the successful redistribution of population which Scotland&apos;schanging industrial structure requires by adopting an imaginative attitude torecruitment, by careful planning and assisting where necessary those workers who have to move home. In addition the Ministry of Labour already assistindustry in the transfer of labour directly by means of financial assistance. the resettlement transfer scheme assists unemployed workers whose employmentprospects are poor in their home area to move to jobs in other areas. A secondscheme assists employed persons designated as key workers whose transfer isnecessary to their firms moving to or expanding in a development district and a third scheme helps unemployed workers in these districts to transfer temporarilyfor training to a parent factory outside the district before they start work athome.(iii) Acquiring new skills46. Change and growth of skills must keep pace with change and growth in industry. In past years, although there have been shortages of skilled labour invarious occupations, Scottish firms and firms new to Scotland have on thewhole not had serious difficulties in meeting their labour requirements. Thesituation has, however, altered in some measure during the past year in three ofthe main male-employing industries engineering, construction and ship-building. If the demand for skilled labour continues to increase without aconcurrent expansion of the supply, bottlenecks in key categories will occurwhich may prejudice the expansion plans of both new and existing firms.47. One way of avoiding this is to make better use of the craft skills which areavailable in Scotland by upgrading and training of workers to undertake moreskilled jobs; encouraging progress has taken place in the use of the TemporaryRelaxation Agreement in engineering in respect of jobs which arc normally openonly to time-served skilled men. In the Shipbuilding Industry some valuableagreements have already been made, for example, in regard to interchangcabilityof platers and shipwrights, and flexibility in certain key trades. These achievc-ments should go some way to removing obstacles to the expansion of Scottishindustry and to achieving the better deployment of manpower but much still

remains to be done. Many existing restrictive or protective practices on bothsides of industry are a legacy of insecurity; this insecurity, in turn, derivedpartly from a lack of consistency and purpose in the national economy and theabsence of clearly defined economic objectives. The National Plan and thepresent plans for Scotland define such objectives and the Government are determined to achieve them. This determination must however be matched by industry itself in every field of activity and, most important of all, in efficiency of performance and in productivity. The Government therefore look to both sides of industry in Scotland to respond to the challenge.Conclusion48. Against the background of a labour shortage foreseen in the national plan for Great Britain as a whole, Scotland&apos;s labour resources are an asset for future economic growth. With the reduction in the drain of able manpower toother regions, which is a firm objective, this asset will become stronger and more valuable. But in a period of rapid economic transition the labour force mustadapt itself smoothly to new jobs, new methods and new locations. wherever possible the Government will assist in easing the changes which are necessary through the action which it is at present taking and by the measures it nowproposes to take in the fields of education, redundancy payments, housing andin all the other ways discussed in this Paper.

Chapter IVLABOUR TRAINING AND MANAGEMENTTraining49. In the attempt to bring more workers into employment and to make better use of those already in employment, training has a major part to play.50. Under the Industrial Training Act, 1964, responsibility for ensuring that both the quantity and quality of industrial training are made adequate has nowbeen placed on Industrial Training Boards. The Boards will be undertakingman power forecasts, including the demand for skills, on a regional basis. NineBoards have been set up covering the industries most dependent on skilled labour and within three years it is expected that there will be about 25 Boardscovering practically all industry. The Boards for engineering, construction, ironand steel, wool and shipbuilding, have now started to operate the arrangementsprescribed in the Act for imposing a levy on firms in the industry and payinggrants to the firms whose training is approved. This should give a considerableimpetus to training in Scotland as elsewhere.51. The Ministry of Labour has established a Central Training Council toadvise him on the operation of the Industrial Training Act and the council has appointed a Scottish Committee to deal with problems arising in Scotland.The Committee^ recommendations about the intake of apprentices to theengineering industry have already been noted in paragraph 6 of Chapter 111.The Committee will also be looking at the needs of the expanding construction industry which, while already attracting a large number of boys each year, willrequire a higher intake of apprentices to meet future demands. The Committeeis now engaged on a study of training facilities in the Highlands, which will include an examination of the possibility of promoting a group training schemewhich firms in a suitable location there could operate. Four group trainingschemes embracing 40 firms have already been set up in other parts of Scotlandand their membership is expanding; other schemes are in the course of formation.52. The Government gives through the Ministry of Labour financial support for the development of training in a number of ways. It assists with the costof &apos;in-plant&apos; training by new and expanding firms in development districts.Since the inception of this scheme in September, 1964, financial assistance hasbeen accepted by nearly 70 firms in Scotland for training 1,700 men, of whomhalf were in engineering, and 3,800 women. The advantage of this form oftraining scheme is its flexibility as it assists firms to train new employees tothe precise degree of skill required. The Industrial Training Service, a grant-aided, non-profit making body, is available to give employers and industrial organisations, on a fee-paying basis, a consultancy service which assists inanalysing training requirements and establishing satisfactory training pro-grammes and syllabuses. Grants are also available to promote and developgroup training schemes (until the Boards are in a position to take over), andto enable employers&apos; associations and joint bodies to appoint training develop-ment officers to develop and improve systematic training schemes within an industry. In addition the Ministry makes grants in respect of the training oftraining officers and the periods of industrial training forming part of certain types of sandwich course; and to Industrial Training Boards in respect of (a)their administrative expenses in the first year of their existence, (b) their cxpendi-ture on the provision of training courses for training supervisors and instructors,

(c) the cost of research undertaken or sponsored by the Boards and&quot; (d) thecurrent expenses of providing additional places for off-the-job training.53. The Government itself is directly concerned in training. As a result ofrecent expansion there are now seven Government Training Centres in Scotlandwith a potential output of up to 1.700 a year. These centres provide facilitiesfor the training of unskilled and semi-skilled workers and the retraining of skilled workers in new or more specialised skills. Most trainees are being placedor found employment which utilises their training. A further new centre whichis to be built in Edinburgh should be ready this year. In addition, plans for expanding training in the existing training centres are in hand. When theseexpansions are completed, the Centres in Scotland will he capable of producingup to 2,200 trainees per annum.Management54. Without good management the Scottish economy cannot realise its fullpotential. Its productivity must improve at least as fast as that of the national economy as a whole. It must maintain the competitiveness of its products andthis depends on the efficiency with which they are produced, which impliesgood labour relations, the technology reflected in their production and in theirdesign, and the effectiveness of their marketing. New industry will be more readily attracted to the Scottish economy and will develop more efficiently init, if the climate of opinion is one which is favourable to high productivity. Inall this the role of management is of the greatest possible importance. Whilethe precise ways in which management should approach these tasks will differ from case to case, the principal features of the way forward can be stated.55. Management must become much more professional. There is a need tounderstand, accept and exploit new technologies to a far greater extent than hitherto. There is also a need for management to become more aggressive inits competitiveness. Above all, it must take the lead, and contribute its part,in achieving a closer understanding between labour and management on theirjoint problem of increased productivity.56. To do these things, management must be better trained, and for thispurpose firms, to a much greater extent than hitherto, should deliberately andsystematically release their management staff&quot; to take part in the wide variety oftraining courses which are already available as well as providing training onthe job.57. Management needs to pay greater attention to research and development.There should be a technologically qualified staff at all levels in the management structure. The techniques of management themselves require more study andimplementation. These techniques have in recent years moved forward partic-particularly rapidly in the general field of quantitative methods, including the useof computer-based planning, programming, and recording techniques and thegeneral exploitation of electronic data processing. But these methods alone willnot be enough unless they are accompanied by more general understanding ofthe operation of the economy, competence in marketing and, last but not least,full awareness of the human organisation of industry and commerce. Effectivemanagement also entails discriminating use of the contributions which the specialised professional agencies, such as banks, accountants, and industrialconsultants can make.

58. Scottish managements have three special factors in their favour in this task. Firstly, the Scottish educational system has for many years been producinggraduates, including technologists, in greater proportion than elsewhere in britain. In spite of this, the proportion of administrative, clerical, and (signi-ficantly) technical employees in Scottish industry&apos; is low by English standards.There is here an obvious opportunity which Scottish industry should turn toits advantage. Competition for the products of Scottish education, however, is strong and Scottish employers will need to give particular thought to the opportunities they can offer these young people. The proposals for growth are such that it is not tenable to argue that the volume of such opportunitiescannot be improved.59. Secondly, Scotland has a notable professional heritage in professionsrelevant to business and finance. A mention of the special place of Scottishbanking, accountancy and insurance provides examples of this. With suchresources at close hand, the urgent need to improve management efficiency and productivity suggests that managements should make much more use ofall forms of specialist advice.60. Thirdly, Scottish Universities and other Scottish educational institutionshave shown themselves willing and able to provide courses in managementproblems and management techniques. These courses are not used to the extent they should be. Firms should release their executives to these courses as adeliberately formulated policy.61. Action to achieve the broad objectives set out here must lie primarily with the top management of each individual firm. The Government looks to each firm to consider its position in this respect and to play its part in meetingthe national need for higher industrial and commercial efficiency. For its part,the Government can and will ensure, chiefly through the Central TrainingCouncil and the Industrial Training Boards, that the necessary managementtraining facilities and supporting educational infrastructure are provided. then looks to each individual firm to exploit these fully.PRINTERS NOTEThis completes Chapter IV.

Chapter VIAGRICULTURE, FISHING AND FORESTRYAgricultureSize and Character of the Industry93. Agriculture is one of the largest industries in Scotland and providesemployment for over 100.000 persons. There are 16-7 million acres of land usedfor agriculture, of which crops and grass account for 4-3 million and roughgrazings for 12-4 million. The main crops grown are cereals (1 million acres),potatoes (150,000 acres), fodder roots (250,000 acres) and grass (2-8 million acres). Dairy farming predominates in the south-west, arable farming withlivestock production in the east and north-east and sheep and cattle rearing inthe hills and uplands of the Highlands and southern Scotland.94. Scottish farming has traditionally been based on a mixed system of cropand livestock husbandry. Livestock and livestock products account for about80 per cent of the industry&apos;s gross output; a considerable acreage of crops(including grass) is required to provide food for stock and the remaining landacreage (mainly in the arable areas) is devoted to producing crops for sale for human consumption.95. Compared with other industries Scottish farming continues to be organised in relatively small-sized business units, though its structure comparesvery favourably with that in other countries. On most farms one individual is responsible for providing the management and capital and bearing the financial risks. There are 58,000 agricultural holdings, but over half of these are part orspare-time units where the occupier has some other employment or source of income. The commercial sector of farming comprises the 28,000 full-time farms,which account for 94 per cent of agricultural output; their average size is 140acres of crops and grass and 330 acres of rough grazing with an appropriatecomplement of livestock, and they require a labour force of three to four personsincluding the farmer.96. The close interdependence of farming with the economy as a wholemeans that it supports a substantial amount of indirect employment in ancillaryindustries such as the manufacture of agricultural machinery and fertilisers,in food marketing and processing, etc. This indirect employment is estimated to be of the order of 80.000 mainly, though not entirely, in Scotland or about70 per cent of the numbers of farmers and workers directly employed in Scottishfarming.Recent Trends97. The value of agricultural gross output in Scotland is currently about 190 million, or about 11 per cent of the agricultural output of the UnitedKingdom; in volume it has increased by 20 per cent in the past decade. Themain increases in output have been in barley, beef, mutton, milk and poultryand, except for barley, mostly occurred before 1961. Weather conditions andother factors resulted in some decline in output between 1961 and 1964, but inthe past year there has been a further expansion. A rising level of capital investment, increased yields of crops and stock and the greater use of materials,such as fertilisers and fuel, produced by other industries have all contributed to

increased output. Capital expenditure by fanners and landowners is currentlyestimated at about  20 million a year, of which  7 million is in buildings and 13 million in plant, machinery and vehicles.98. The increase in Scottish agricultural net output i.e. after allowing forthe increased inputs produced by other sectors of the economy has been about15 per cent since 1954/55. The number of farm employees has declined by anaverage of over 2 per cent a year in the past decade and the rate of decline hasrecently been tending to accelerate. The increase in net output has, in fact, been achieved by a labour force (including farmer and wife labour) which has declined by 20 per cent, so that productivity (or output per man) has increasedby over 40 per cent in ten years a rate which exceeds the average for all industries in the United Kingdom. It has also been achieved in spite of an annual loss of about 4,000 acres of mainly arable and grass land for building and otherdevelopment and of 30,000 acres a year (mainly rough grazing land) for afforestation-tion.Future Developments99. In considering the contribution that agriculture can make to national economic growth and the balance of payments, the Government have had regardto the growth in demand for food. It is true that with a rising level of realincomes, the demand for food increases less rapidly than the demand for other commodities as people tend to spend a smaller proportion of their incomes onbasic foods and a larger proportion on other goods and services. Nevertheless,as announced in the National Plan the level of food expenditure is expected toincrease by between 8 and 9 per cent (at constant prices) between 1964 and 1970as a result both of increases in population and rising real income per head. TheGovernment have also taken account of the technical possibilities of expandinghome production, of U.K. international trading relations and the need for themost effective use of resources. In the light of all these factors they have con-cluded that agriculture can make a valuable contribution by a selective expansion programme, provided that this is based upon the maintenance of the rate of increase in the industry*s productivity. This contribution would be made in two important ways; first, it will help through increased production to meet thegrowth in demand; secondly, by continuing the increase in its labour produc-tivity it will release manpower resources to other sectors of the economy. Meat,particularly beef, will play an important part in this expansion; a larger supplyof calves for fattening will be required and this will entail some increase in milk production which will also help to meet the increased demand for milk and milk products. Expanded livestock production will also result in a considerable increase in demand for cereal feed, a substantial part of which might be grownat home.100. The Government have stated that they would expect U.K. agriculture to be able to meet a major part of the additional demand expected by 1970,totalling some  200 million on food for human consumption. The productionrequired from agriculture, and the resources required to produce this, will beconsidered year by year at the Annual Reviews of the economic conditions and prospects of the industry. Scottish farming, with its emphasis on livestockproduction, already produces a relatively large proportion of the UnitedKingdom output of beef (17 per cent) and of mutton and lamb (24 per cent)and should be well placed to play its full part in this expansion. Part of the

expansion in beef production is likely to come from the beef breeding herdswhich are an important part of the Scottish farming economy particularly in hilland upland areas and in the east and north-east of Scotland, while the dairyingareas located mainly in the south-west, should also be able to contribute byproducing more beef calves from the dairy herd and possibly by an increase inbeef breeding herds on dairy farms. An increase in mutton and lamb production is possible both in the hill and upland areas and in districts with medium qualityland which is less suitable for producing cash crops. Though further afforestationmay lead to some reduction in the area of land devoted to hill farming, this losswill be relatively small and should easily be offset by rather more intensivestocking on the remaining land. Increased production of cereals for food islikely to be mainly in the arable farming areas in the east of Scotland.101. Employment in Scottish agriculture is likely to continue to decline. Inthe period to 1970 the estimated further reduction in the number of farm workersis 8,000-10,000 or 12 to 15 per cent. A continuing decline in employment isquite compatible with an expansion of agricultural output, provided that therate of growth in productivity is maintained at the same rate as in recent years.The effects of this further decline in the agricultural labour force in particular areas e.g., the North-East and the Borders have been examined in relationto their future development and the proposals for those areas take account ofthe prospective changes in the farming economy.102. It is also desirable that farms which at present are too small to provide an adequate standard of living should be amalgamated into larger units. Someamalgamation of farm units has been taking place in Scotland, and a recentestimate is that the number of occupiers of agricultural holdings had beendeclining by 500 (or about 1 per cent) a year. The White Paper on The Develop-ment of Agriculture* outlined ways in which the Government will offer help to farmers to do this; it also outlined proposals to develop still further farming inthe hills and uplands, to encourage co-operation in agriculture and horticultureand to provide for a continuing programme of modernising fixed equipment on farms. So far as the Highlands and Islands are concerned an area of special problems a new Development Board with powers and finance has been set upto promote economic and social development. All these schemes, along with the continuation of the various direct farming grants and the emphasis now being placed by the advisory services on improved business management, will help to promote greater productivity, enable the industry to increase its contributionto the national economy and enable farmers to improve their incomes.103. In the ancillary industries, concerned with servicing agriculture and the marketing of farm products, the general tendency towards concentration infewer and larger units is likely to continue. Though some expansion in these services will be required they are likely to be based more on the smaller and medium-sized towns rather than in villages or purely rural areas. The increasein the demand for food and the current trend towards greater processing andprepackaging of foodstuffs should give scope for some expansion in the foodprocessing industries, and a study of these industries in the North-East ofScotland is at present being undertaken for the Scottish Economic planning council by economists at the University of Aberdeen.* Cmnd. 2738.

FishingThe Size and Character of the Industry104. The fishing industry contributes directly to the economic wellbeing ofthe nation in two ways, firstly by using domestic manpower and domesticallyconstructed facilities to produce foodstuffs for the people of this country and,secondly, by exporting part of its products. In particular, the herring industry,even at its present level of overseas trade, is a net exporter. Moreover, theindustry&apos;s by-products fish meal and edible oil, of both of which this countryis a considerable importer are savers of foreign exchange.105. The Scottish fishing fleet has been largely modernised with the help of Government grants and in the favourable conditions of 1964 it landed a record weight of white fish. The value of all British landings in Scotland was 17*6 m., almost one-third of the output of the U.K. fishing industry. this included white fish at  14-0 m., herring at around  2-0 m. more than 75 percent of all the herring taken by British vessels was landed at Scottish ports,nearly half in the Highlands and Islands and shellfish at some  1 *6 m. Whereasnearly half the U.K. catch is taken in distant waters by company-ownedtrawlers, nearly the whole of the Scottish catch is taken in inshore, near and middle waters; and two-thirds of it is caught by share fishermen using boats of less than 80 ft. The Scottish fleet includes 129 trawlers over 80 ft. in length andsome 2,800 smaller vessels. It employs 8,000 fishermen full time and 2,000 parttime, and about 18,000 shore workers are involved in ancillary occupations.106. Most of the catch is processed to some degree before distribution. Alittle is still salt cured for export, substantial amounts are smoke cured for thehome trade, and an increasing quantity is despatched filleted, cither fresh orquick-frozen. Processing is becoming increasingly mechanised. This developmentcalls for steady throughputs and, while some processing plant has been installedat the smaller ports, the trade is mainly concentrated on Aberdeen which issecond only to the Humber ports as a fish handling centre. Probably three-quarters of the fish landed in Scotland is consumed in England where it hasenjoyed a premium for freshness in comparison with distant water fish landedwet.107. While most of the trawl-caught fish is landed at Aberdeen, significantquantities of white fish, most of the herring catch and the whole of the shellfishcatch are landed at smaller ports, including many in the Highlands and Islands.Future Development108. The future of the Scottish fishing industry depends on many factorsoutwith the industry&apos;s control. Although experiments have begun with rearingmarine fish in Scottish waters and marine fish farming may eventually becommercially possible for many years fishing must remain a hunting occupa-tion in competition with growing foreign fishing fleets. More herring couldreadily be caught at some seasons, but to increase the market would requirebetter quality fish at the right times. The Herring Industry Board is makingefforts to achieve this result as well as to achieve manpower economics.109. While not of great significance in the context of the National Plan the herring industry plays an important part in Scotland. The Herring industry board has estimated that the industry has an immediate growth potential of25 per cent and believes that the extra herring which the industry needs can beexpected to be taken in northern waters. The growth point of the industry will,

therefore, be in Scotland. The home and export market for shellfish could readily be expanded but there are doubts whether the stocks in some areas will standmore exploitation. Plans for development of salmon and trout fishing inScotland, the notional value of which much exceeds the market price of thecatch (approximately  1-5 m.), must await full consideration of the report received in 1965 of the Hunter Committee.110. Manpower economies in catching white fish may be expected to continue at about the rate which obtained over the last five years. (A saving in that periodof 600 regular and 600 part-time jobs, mostly on smaller vessels.) Thoughgeneral trends (including over-fishing) are against continuing the weight ofcatch achieved in recent years from traditional grounds given the maintenanceof its outlets, the Scottish fleet should also maintain its share of the U.K. catch.Dependence on the English market has been noted. The full competitive impact of freezer trawlers now being introduced by Humber firms, some of themsubsidiaries of integrated groups owning processing plants and distributionnetworks, has yet to be felt. The Scottish owners who undertake freezing at seaoperate from the Humber. It seems likely that, as in other food trades, retailsales of fish will increasingly be in branded convenience packs, centrally pro-duced and distributed by increasingly mechanised and standardised methods.Aberdeen is well placed for such development but the interests concerned mustmarshal their forces to compete with the large Humber firms. As to employment on the shoreward side, elaboration of processes should tend to counterbalancemanpower savings through mechanisation. The Government will meantimecontinue to support the industry with scientific research directed both totechniques of catching and handling marine food, and by seeking international agreement on conservation of fish stocks by the prevention of over-fishing. Thiswill assist the industry to maintain its position, but the industry itself must alsobe willing to accept the necessary changes in its organisation if it is to meetsuccessfully the challenge of future years.Forestry111. At the end of 1964 the Forestry Commission plantations in Scotlandextended to 700,000 acres of which more than half a million acres were plantedafter 1945. At the same date it was estimated that there were 450,000 acres ofmanaged woodlands in private ownership in Scotland, and again, largely because so many private woods were felled dnringthe war, a considerable propor-tion of that acreage consists of post-war planting. The total acreage of managedwoods in Scotland represents only 6.1 per cent of the land surface, appreciablyless than in most European countries.112. The full effect of the rapid expansion of planting after the war has notyet had time to express itself in terms of employment since substantially morelabour is required for production and manufacturing, than for planting andmaintenance work before felling starts. Present production from thinning andfelling is still largely confined to pre-war plantations, but during the next five-years we shall be entering a long period where production will rise very rapidly.113. The operation and management of the Commission^ plantations inScotland, together with associated manufacturing, provides employment for ,500 industrial workers in addition to supervisory and administrative staff;the corresponding figure for privately-owned plantations is estimated at 3,000

giving a total estimated employment figure of 7,500. Present total production of timber in Scotland is around 39,000.000 cubic feet out of a total Great Britainproduction of 110,000,000 cubic feet.114. The Fort William Pulp and Paper Mill, now nearing completion, willhave an annual intake of 12 million cubic feet when it gets into full productionand this will continue into the mid-1970s, after which the intake is scheduled toincrease by 50 per cent.115. Untii 1975 the estimated peak labour employment at the mill is 1,300workers; when, thereafter, the intake of timber rises, the likely increase in milllabour is 100 with an additional 380 required in the forests and in transport toprovide the raw material.116. During the next 20-25 years the Fort William mill together with thechipboard factory at Inverness will consume nearly the whole of the productionof smaller sized timber coming from thinnings in the Highland area. The largersizes consisting of the butt cuts of thinnings and from some clear felling of olderstands of timber will go to the sawmills.117. From the late 1970s onwards there will be available almost twice asmuch saw-log material as at present. A need in this sector will be the rationalisation-tion of saw milling into a smaller number of larger and more efficient mills, someworking a million or more cubic feet of timber per annum.118. The planting proposals announced in 1963 provided for a programme of141,000 acres for the five-year period 1964-68. An additional 12,000 acres ofplanting for this period was approved by the present Government in April 1965and this will enable planting to continue at the rate of at least 30,000 acres a yearuntil 1968.119. The Government fully recognise the importance of afforestationin providing employment opportunities in the rural areas and in providing the raw material for home based timber-using industry. In the Highlands forestryoffers the best prospects of providing the necessary industrial core to the economy. It has accordingly been decided to increase the Forestry Commission^planting programme in Scotland to 36,000 acres a year from 1969 until further notice, subject to periodic review. The increase in the programme will be applied in the Highlands and in the seven crofting counties planting will be increased to20,000 acres a year. Substantial inducements are already available for the encouragement of private forestry, and planting by private interests is at presentrunning at the rate of 14,000 acres a year, of which between 4,000-4,500 acresare in the crofting counties.

Chapter vii the SERVICE INDUSTRIES120. The service industries^ employ roughly half of the labour force, inScotland as in the United Kingdom as a whole. They embrace gas, electricity and water, transport and communications, the distributive trades, education,medicine, other professional and scientific services, insurance, banking and finance. They include also the provision of entertainment and sports facilities,personal services such as hairdressing, and the catering and hotel industry(which are vital to the important Scottish Tourist industry), and central andlocal government.121. Though service industries were expanding slightly less rapidly inScotland than in Great Britain over the period 1960 to 1964, the numbersoccupied in these industries in Scotland increased by over 5 per cent to a totalof 1,071,900 in 1964. The services sector increased its share of total Scottishemployment by 1-9 per cent over this period. Indeed, because of the heavydeclines in employment in primary industries, and the large job losses in someolder manufacturing industries, the service industries with a net gain of 56,000jobs made the major contribution to the expansion of employment in the years1960 to 1964.122. The increased employment in professional and scientific services wasthe main element in this expansion, with particular growth in educational,medical and dental services; but retail distribution, the catering and hotel tradeand the motor repair and garage trade also showed considerable growth. Inall this, Scottish experience has been very similar to that of the rest of thecountry, though it is of some significance that the increase in employment inthe catering and hotel industry between 1960 and 1964 was proportionatelythree times as great in Scotland as in Great Britain as a whole.123. Within Scotland, sheer weight of population puts the bulk of serviceemployment in Central Scotland. Service industries are less well represented in the Borders and South-West than elsewhere; in the Borders the number of employees in these industries has been going down, and in the South-West ithas been almost static while elsewhere the trend has been upward. The Borderspresent a classic example of an area where there is no incentive for the serviceindustries to expand. The Highlands, because of the importance of the touristtrades, such as hotels and catering, have proportionately more people in serviceindustries than the other parts of Scotland, and the rate of increase there hasbeen slightly higher than in Central Scotland. Without the tourist industrycomponent, however, the Highlands do not compare so favourably either inpresent level or in rate of growth of service industry.124. Adequate and up-to-date services are important if Scotland is to bean attractive area for incoming industrialists. A satisfactory background of basic services and recreational facilities, good shops and adequate transport,schools and medical services-these are all things which may influence indus-industrialists when they are considering factory locations. The service industries,therefore, have a major role to play in the build-up of modern manufacturing industry and in the reduction of migration from Scotland.* Excluding the construction industry see Chapter XV.

125. Certain of the service industries can also make a direct contributionto the development of the Scottish economy since they are themselves generatorsof economic growth. This is true particularly of office employment and the tourist industry, both of which the Scottish Economic Planning Council hasbeen considering in relation to the overall strategy of Scottish economic development.Office Employment126. With increasing automation on the factory floor and the growingcomplexity of management, control and sales services in industry, the propor-tion of office employment in the economy as a whole has been rising. economic growth is increasingly fostered by the development of these functions, as wellas by such activities as insurance and banking where Scotland has traditionallybeen active. The development of much improved communications has also made possible the siting of office activity in parts of the country which wouldonce have been considered inaccessible but which now have the virtue that theyare free of the increasing congestion experienced in the South-East and offerconsiderable savings in office rents compared with the Central London area.127. The Government has now embarked on a policy of steering office development away from the South-East and the Birmingham area. The move ofthe Post Office Savings Bank to Glasgow is a step which the Government hasitself been able to take under this policy. Transfers of this kind and of privateoffices can contribute to the building-up in Scotland of a more diversified range of employment opportunities.128. While there is a tendency for firms and public bodies to be more willingto establish new or expanded offices in centres with fairly large populations, thepossibilities of siting offices in towns of small or medium size must not be lostsight of. Office development will flourish most successfully if it is located in thoseplaces where postal and telecommunications services, transport facilities,housing and other social services and the supply of suitable staff arc all readily available.129. It is important for Scotland to share fully in the development of this type of employment if a balanced modern economy is to be built up. TheScottish Economic Planning Board is therefore studying the potential of various parts of Scotland for the siting of new offices with a view to identifying these places which would be most suitable for expanded office activity in the im-mediate future, and those where possibilities exist in the longer term.Tourism130. As incomes grow and as leisure and paid holidays increase, there ismore money to spend on travel and tourism and more time in which to spend it.Thus one obvious mark of growing material wealth is the rapid expansion ofthe tourist industry. It is pre-eminently an industry which flourishes on marginalexpenditure: when real incomes are rising markedly tourist expenditure tends to rise faster than increases of total income. In value terms, accordingly, tourismhas been increasing internationally in the last five years at about 15 per cent perannum and it is now a significant element in the economic growth of mostEuropean countries. This is certainly true of its importance within the Scottisheconomy, The limited statistics available have recently been examined and

suggest that the value of tourism in Scotland in 1964-65 might have been of theorder of  65 million.131. Scotland has many attractions for tourists and holiday makers: thebeauty of the countryside; its suitability for outdoor sports, from walking,climbing and ski-ing to fishing, sailing, and water ski-ing; and rich literary,historic and romantic associations. In spite of these considerable naturaladvantages, however, there is evidence that the extra numbers of English and overseas visitors to Scotland has been increasingly offset in recent years by thenumber of Scots who now holiday outwith Scotland. Special efforts are thereforeneeded if Scotland is to expand its share of an increasingly competitive market.132. The Scottish Tourist Board&apos;s new constitution provides for directrepresentation of the main sections of the industry (including the three majortransport undertakings). The Board is confident that this will result in greaterfinancial support from all sections of the industry, and the first objective of thenew Board will be to establish the priorities for effective action to developScottish tourism to match the expanding and changing market. The basicrequirements for expansion already seem clear, but much more detailed informa-tion is necessary if the development of the industry along the most advantageouslines is to be secured and the Secretary of State has offered the new Board aspecial grant of up to  75.000 for an agreed programme of research spread over three years.133. The Board will have before them:(a) the results of a comprehensive market research survey, carried out bythe Social Survey Division of the Central Oflice of Information, at the instance of the Scottish Development Department, to find what people in the United Kingdom really thought about Scotland as a holiday area,what facilities they wanted and what problems of accommodation orcommunication they encountered; and(b) the result of a series of informal approaches to leading interests in theindustry which were made on behalf of the Scottish Economic planning council to help assess the potential of tourism within an expandingScottish economy and to obtain a representative selection of views on lines of research or pilot schemes which the new Board might undertake.134. The Tourist Board will then be able to start a programme of workwhich should result in the production of the first complete review of the marketpotential of the industry and identification of the most promising lines of expansion, as a sound factual base for future action by the Board itself, by local and central government, within the industry and in the Highlands by the highlands and Islands Development Board.135. While it would be premature to anticipate the specific lines of action towhich current and future research might point, it is already clear that the bestdividends might be yielded by concentrating physical development in a numberof carefully spaced areas, as was recommended by the Highland Panel in theirreport on Land Use. Generally, the chief requirements seem to be more, andmore modern, accommodation (from hotels to camping sites) for more, andmore mobile, tourists; a general raising of standards and a scheme that will promote public confidence in the standards; improvements in the transport system, including in particular air services, car sleepers, roads and vehicleferries; and more systematic publicity aimed at the most promising markets.

136. Markets are continually changing: there is great current and potentialgrowth in outdoor activities and one of them ski-ing has already changedand lengthened the season in the Cairngorms. Again, the switch to more mobileholidays, based on private transport, has benefited the more remote areas atleast partly at the expense of the older established coastal resorts (althoughwith better accommodation and up-to-date recreational facilities they mightbenefit in turn from the noticeable trend towards second holidays). If. however,the industry can be given a correct identification of the problems and potentialsof growth, then private initiative to exploit these potentials, backed by publicplanning and enterprise e.g. in the tourist development proposals of the local planning authorities (aided in due course by the proposed Countryside Corn-mission) and in road building could build up an industry which would notonly make a growing contribution within the Scottish economy, but wouldeven by transforming the whole economic basis of particular areas make asubstantial contribution towards solving some of the regional planning problems in the outer regions of Scotland.Other Service Activities137. To a large extent the size and variety of the remainder of the serviceindustries are influenced by the size of the population which they serve, and the soundness of the regional economy generally. With the build-up of the Scottisheconomy that is envisaged in the period up to 1970, therefore, there will go a growth in employment in the service sector. Provided it is achieved with im-proved efficiency, this will be a sign of progress.138. There are important links between the service industries and improvedproductivity in the Scottish economy. First because as many people are em-ployed in service industry as in manufacturing industry so that more efficient working, and higher output per man, are just as important here as they are in manufacturing industry if our resources are to be used to the best advantage.And second because certain of the service industry activities contribute signili-cantly to the satisfactory working of the manufacturing sectors and can help toimprove productivity there.139. The distributive trades, both retail and wholesale, in which scotland has nearly 300,000 employees, constitute the biggest single service industrysector, and so particular attention should be directed to efficiency and pro-productivity in these trades. With the growth in population and incomes, retailsales will grow though they are not expected to expand as fast as the growth indisposable income since an increasing proportion of consumer expenditure will be spent outside the retail network. The increase in employment should be relatively modest because of the opportunities to improve labour efficiencywithin the industry; these are perhaps greater in Scotland than in Great Britaingenerally since Scotland&apos;s average turnover per employee (as shown by the 1961Census of Distribution) is lower than the Great Britain average. In part this issymptomatic of the easier labour situation which has existed in Scotland butthis position may well change and so provide an additional incentive to improve the use of labour within the retail trade.140. In transport and communications, which employ nearly 170,000 cm-ployees, a continuing reduction of the labour force employed on the railwaysand in road passenger transport is anticipated, in line with the trend in these

industries in the United Kingdom generally; the road haulage industry isexpected to expand its output, but to make some gains in efficiency which will lead to a rather smaller increase in total employment, though this will still bea significant sector in employment growth.141. Production of the gas, electricity and water industries is estimated toincrease by 8-4 per cent per annum up to 1970 (Chapter 11, table A) to meet therequirements of expanding industry, the growth of population, the provisionof new houses, and the rise in the standard of living. But in employment termsthis is relatively a small sector with only 33,000 workers at present, and con-tinuing improvement in output per head should mean that the demand for additional labour will be relatively modest. The period to 1970 is also expectedto produce continuing expansion in the catering and hotel trades, to which thegrowth of tourism is expected to contribute.142. The biggest expansion in service employment is likely to be in profes-sional and scientific services in which 240,000 are employed. Much of this is accounted for by the education and medical services. Here the government must plan ahead to provide the level of facilities which will be needed for the anticipated population growth, and the higher standards of education and medical care which are likely to be required. Growth of employment is likelytherefore to be rapid in this sector over the next five years, as it has been in thelast five.143. The Government is conscious of the role which the service industries have to play in the expansion of the Scottish economy. In addition to the con-tribution which certain of them make directly to economic growth, they helpprovide the basic prerequisites for industry as well as providing the facilities and opportunities which go with a rising standard of living. They also play animportant part in influencing both the capacity to restrain migration and the ability to attract new industry. The Governments part so far as service indus-tries are concerned, is to maintain and improve existing standards and to and the  expansion of the service sector by building up a strong and viable economy.

Part II.   Physical Pattern of Growth and ExpansionChapter VIIICENTRAL SCOTLAND144. The generalisations about Industrial Scotland in Chapters 1 and II are really generalisations about Central Scotland. Four-fifths of the Scottishpopulation and the bulk of manufacturing industry are in the central belt, andthis is where the problems and possibilities of economic growth exist on thelargest scale. In Central Scotland net migration is much the heaviest in thecountry in the west both absolutely and proportionally. Yet at the same time it is the part of Scotland which offers the widest scope for rapid modernisation and expansion.145. The reasons why Central Scotland holds both the biggest challenge andthe best hopes for the future are to be found in the structural changes in theScottish economy already described. Job losses in traditional industries havenaturally been concentrated there and the volume of unemployment has been much the heaviest. This decline in traditional industry besides contributing to unemployment has also, which is more significant in the longer term, reduced the prospect of employment especially male employment-for many schoolleavers and younger members of the labour force. Newer forms of employmentthough growing fast have not arisen in sufficient quantity to fill the gap. This isthe principal reason why Central Scotland, especially in the west, has contributedso much to net migration losses.146. A subsidiary reason is the poor quality of urban environment in muchof industrial Central Scotland. This assumes greater importance when it isremembered that net migration is the result of a two-way gross movement inwhich the attraction of workers from other parts of Britain is also significant.Among the older communities of the west, not only are the results of theindustrial revolution on social conditions still apparent, but standards of replacement are in danger of being sacrificed in the understandable desire for more rapid progress.147. As Central Scotland loses most by migration and is the region wheremigration movement is most sensitive to changes in the economic climate, itis there that the effects of any substantial reduction of migration will be mostimmediately felt. The task is therefore doubly heavy. The rapid redevelopmentof Glasgow and certain other towns must continue. But added to this will bethe need to provide houses and other services for an expanding population aswell.148. Fortunately Central Scotland contains many encouraging elements which make the necessary regeneration possible. The sheer numbers of people in the region, and the high rate of natural increase, have created the circumstances incertain places for a growth as rapid as any in the U.K. The roots of this positivetrend lie as far back as the thirties, when in 1937 the industrial estate ofHillington was established in association with some of the low-density inter-war

housing estates. It successfully showed that Scottish labour could adapt to theneeds of modern industry, and subsequent developments in post-war planninghave shown this still more clearly. These developments have really comprisedtwo strands: one economically directed, the other socially directed.149. The economically directed strand, in the major industrial estatesdeveloped during the immediate post-war years and assisted by Board of Tradesteering policy, has accounted for some of Scotland&apos;s biggest concentrations of modern industry. These estates were deliberately sited to draw upon wide labourcatchment areas. Thus in the West of Scotland Newhouse draws on EasternGlasgow, Airdrie, Coatbridge and Hamilton; Hillington draws on westerGlasgow, Renfrew, Paisley and Clydebank; while Queenslie, Thornliebank,Blantyre, and Kingsway on the north of Dundee exploit comparable groupingsin their areas. Edinburgh^ estate at Sighthill on the extreme west of the cityalso works for a large hinterland.150. The point about these estates is that they accept and exemplify travel-to-work as a positive feature in a conurbation of separate communities originallytied to local traditional industries. In the Dundee area these were the shrinkingjute and flax complex; more commonly they were related to natural resources in the Edinburgh area coal and shale; in the west coal, iron and the RiverClyde itself.151. The second or Socially&apos; directed strand in post-war planning runsprincipally from the advisory reports on Central Scotland above all from theAbercrombie Report on the Clyde Valley. This recognised the implications forthe future of Glasgow&apos;s housing problem and the scale of thinking necessary ifit were to be dealt with. It led to the &apos;Glasgow&apos; new towns of East Kilbride andCumbernauld and the concept of Glasgow overspill, given statutory embodi-ment in the Housing and Town Development (Scotland) Act, 1957. And theAbercrombie estimates of likely Glasgow overspill put at 2-300,000 havenot proved over-estimates. East Kilbride and Cumbernauld have made out-standing contributions to Scottish post-war housing and urban environmentwith a tone and quality comparable with the best anywhere in Great Britain.They are increasingly attractive, in the standards of modern living they create,to the younger people of whom Scotland cannot hold enough. These new townsand the principal overspill reception areas have proved economically successfultoo. But not entirely for the reasons originally assumed.152. It was anticipated that the new towns would have an industrial com-ponent indeed it was hoped they would be economically self-contained. Andthe value of overspill population to labour supply in places outside Glasgowwas also recognised. But the new towns even Glenrothes have from the outset been the subject of much cross movement and travel-to-work. This hasnot diminished. While a substantial number of those who work in East Kilbrideand Cumbernauld naturally live there, many come from Glasgow daily, andmany who live there work in the city. There is considerable interchange withneighbouring communities as well. As the new towns have grown, the movementof population to them, whether through formal overspill agreements or volun-voluntarily, has been made much easier by proximity to Glasgow and the possibilityof commuting in the event of employment and housing provision not beingquite in phase.153. In other words much of the success of the Scottish new towns, no lessthan the industrial estates, derives from their lying within the complex labour

market and within range of the elaborate service facilities of a metropolitanor heavily urbanised area (Fig. 2). Glenrothes, with its relation to the nearbyFife towns, is no exception, though the relative slowness of its early developmentreflects its less thickly populated urban hinterland.154. Again, the movement of population from Glasgow under organisedoverspill arrangements has been most successful when it has been related tothose areas in which new housing and other services have been matched byindustrial growth and expansion, particularly the new towns and areas likeKirkintilloch, Linwood, Greater Livingston and Irvine.155. The studies carried out by the Scottish Economic Planning Board andCouncil have shown that in Central Scotland the economically and sociallydirected strands of post-war planning are essentially complementary and that,properly integrated together, they could help to create in certain key areas ofnew development a powerful stimulus to economic growth. They have alsodemonstrated that the labour mobility, which the provision of new houses in new growth areas can provide, is an essential ingredient to faster industrial expansion. The Government therefore propose to build on these past successesand to intensify the provision of housing and other essential services in suitablelocations in Central Scotland where the necessary movements of populationarising from the decongestion of towns and cities can be matched with new industry steered by the Governments distribution of industry policy. An outline of the strategy implied by this policy of linking up social and economic progress is set out in Chapter X. It will be subject to further consideration by the ScottishEconomic Planning Board and Council as part of the process of implementation,and will be fully discussed with the local authorities concerned.156. The key elements in the physical pattern are the concentrations of population on Clydeside, in the Forth basin and in Fife, North Lanarkshireand North Ayrshire. Increasingly Dundee will form part of this complex. It willbe seen from the map that by 1970 all these areas will be closely knit together bya new communications system. In fact, when this system is complete, fewcomparable areas in Great Britain will have such a compact range of modernfacilities and services. Each of the major estuaries the Clyde, the Forth and theTay will have been bridged by entirely new road crossings and the mctro-politan influence of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee-.....which is such animportant element in both the social and economic structure will be exercisedmuch more efficiently. Areas of labour catchment will be increased and theaccess to the facilities and services which these metropolitan concentrations can provide, ranging from higher education facilities at the universities and central institutions to the social and cultural amenities which mean so much to con-temporary society, will be more readily available to a wider population.157. Of these metropolitan sub-regions, as they might be called, it is clearthat the one around Glasgow, which contains nearly 40 per cent of the popula-tion of Scotland, is the most important and represents the most significantproblems and possibilities. The City of Glasgow has embarked upon the largestredevelopment scheme in Great Britain and decisions taken by the present government, in particular the approval of the first developments of the majortransformation of the internal roads system there, will ensure that this re-development proceeds with the utmost speed.158. The growth and change which this scale of new development implies willcreate opportunities  for greatly  improving environmental  and  planning

Figure 3Travel-to-work between different parts of Central ScotlandThis diagram illustrates the emerging pattern of regional interdependence referred to in paragraph 13.

standards, and at the same time avoiding the congestion and urban sprawlassociated with so much past expansion. As the new towns and the better localauthority housing and redevelopment projects demonstrate, growth within theconurbation can be achieved with a high standard of amenity and urban environ-ment. As part of this process green belts will be reviewed. The object will be to enhance their functions and conserve countryside and landscape of real qualityin its relation to new development. Full visual and recreational opportunitiesmust also be realised.159. The Greater Glasgow Transportation Study has introduced a newdimension into regional thinking, transcending local authority boundaries, andis bringing closer to reality the concept of a coherently developed metropolitan area. It has opened up the prospect of a conurbation designed more as an inter-related pattern of communities than as the old-style concentric cluster around ahigh density city core. The redevelopment of Glasgow, in fact, will be combined with just such a looser-knit kind of city region served by fast modern com-munications and offering the advantage of wide labour-availability withcongenial living conditions.160. A century of the effects of heavy industry on the environment hasunderstandably inured many people in Central Scotland to much gross visualsqualor. This tolerance has its dangers in that it blunts the impulse to improveconditions which do not immediately affect public health. But the attractivenessof the best modern developments is already creating a greater awareness of theneed to clear dereliction and rehabilitate unsightly and run-down areas, especi-ally at the approaches to towns and on important roads. The speed at whichnew industry can be attracted, and the readiness of firms to establish headquartersas well as production units in Scotland will depend considerably on the energy and imagination with which general amenity can be improved.161. Some of the major new schemes themselves will make possible dramaticchanges for the better. Examples are the filling in of the disused Monkland andForth and Clyde Canals as part of the work on the construction of the Glasgowinner ring road, and the rehabilitation of the shale mining areas of West Lothianas part of the development of Greater Livingston. Perhaps one of the mostimaginative pointers to ways in which new development and rehabilitation canbe combined is the proposal now being investigated for a Middle Clyde RegionalPark. At present the Clyde Valley is at this point subject to Hooding as a resultof subsidence and is disfigured by much dereliction. The proposals would notonly create a valuable recreational asset for nearby urban communities but also provide on M.74 a landscaped entrance to the heart of the country from theSouth which could do much to repair the tarnished image of industrial Scotland.162. In addition to the removal of the major eyesores for which substantialGovernment grants are already available more effort must be directed to the clearing up of general unsightliness which is at present the clear responsibilityof nobody. Local Authorities can themselves do much more to set a goodexample in their own fields and by encouraging Tace-lift&apos; schemes. Thesefrequently call for no more than a co-ordinated and persuasive approach to themaintenance work which private interests will be undertaking anyway. Bodieslike the Civic Trust can also be a valuable supplement to official resources inmaking telling improvements to the detail and texture of the urban and inter-urban landscape.

163. To conclude, there are a number of contingent considerations. One isthat the conception of city populations in terms of present city boundaries mustbe replaced by the economic and environmental reality of the city region.Similarly the Falkirk/Grangemouth area, and the region served by Dundee mustbe thought of and planned for as the entities they are. Another is that, even withthe increased possibilities of travel to work, mobility of labour is so important that a more flexible approach to housing allocation becomes essential. With the limited contribution which private housing makes to the total Scottish pro-vision, the need for workers to be able to move freely and quickly between localauthority areas, and for incomers to be readily housed becomes a paramountresponsibility of the local authorities themselves if they are to play a full partin Scottish recovery. The example of the new towns is instructive here. Theirrapid development of a diverse industrial structure has been greatly helped bythe ready availability of housing to all comers.164. Economic growth on this scale will therefore create an overlappingextension of metropolitan activity. This will combine a thinning out&apos; of CentralGlasgow, and a net gain in the city region together with the strengthening ofother promising places throughout the central belt where progress can be rapid.Such developments will help the transformation of the region, from Prestwickto Arbroath and from Helensburgh to Dunbar, into a pleasanter place in which to live and work as well as to provide the resources of prosperity and spending power which can justify an improved standard of renewal and rehabilitationnot only in Glasgow itself but in North Lanarkshire, Fife, the Falkirk/Grange-mouth area and indeed in Edinburgh.

Chapter IX The BORDERS: THE SOUTH-WEST: THE NORTH-EAST:THE HIGHLANDS AND ISLANDS165. Earlier chapters have discussed the problems and prospects of theScottish Economy as a whole and its relation to that of the U.K., and shownthat the main effort must lie in the rapid transformation of Central Scotland.But the problem of regional imbalance which Scotland demonstrates in a U.K.context may also be observed within Scotland itself. This is principally to befound in the contrast between the central industrial belt, where the bulk of thepopulation and employment are concentrated, and the more rural areas the borders, the South-West, the North-East and the Highlands and Islands.Studies of these areas have been carried out for the Scottish Economic planning council; the findings of each are set out in this chapter and the factual andanalytical material in Append ix A.166. Each of these areas was studied as a whole and it proved that eachhad sufficient consistency and coherence to help sharpen the focus on localproblems. But it quickly became apparent that their future did not lie in developing distinct and separate economies, but in the establishment of anall-Scotland plan of development in which each part of the country could play an increasingly significant part.167. At present, although these areas particularly the North-East possessvaiuable concentrations of industry, their economies are still to a great extentrural in character. It is from this that their difficulties stem. As agriculturebecomes increasingly mechanised, it no longer employs sufficient people tosupport on its own, or with its ancillaries and services, a viable rural economy.Progress in Scottish agriculture, as Chapter VI showed, will continue to involvelabour shedding and amalgamation. The growth of other employment in the regions has not been sufficient to offset this rapid and continuing loss of jobs in agriculture; while the transport revolution has enabled country people to look beyond local communities for their needs. Small towns which have hithertoexisted as service communities for agriculture are shrinking, and such industries as they possessed notably in textiles (once widely dispersed throughout thecountry) or in ancillaries to agriculture have not easily been able to resist the inevitable trend towards larger units and more abundant supplies of labour.168. Even where significant aggregations of population and employment doexist, as at Dundee or Aberdeen, the Western Borders or Dumfries, they havenot been able to grow anything like fast enough to offset the outward trend of migration in the area as a whole migration which is largely out of Scotlandaltogether and not, as often believed, to the Central Belt. The studies showclearly that the long term effect of these trends is to undermine the populationstructure of the whole area, as already cripplingly apparent in the Borders,in such a way as to make growth from local resources impossible and themaintenance of tolerable standards in public services, education and socialamenity increasingly expensive and onerous.169. The aim of the studies has been to analyse the varying ways in whichthis general predicament is affecting each area and identify those places wherepopulation structure, labour supply and industrial potential offer the best scope for consolidation and expansion. But it will be seen that in no case can the scale

and timing of any change be derived solely from the conditions of the area itself.Remedies are shown to be more or less urgently needed more urgently in the borders, for example, less in the South-West but nowhere can the full contribu-tion of the study areas to an expanding Scottish economy be made withoutconsiderable reinforcement of business enterprise, skilled labour and population from outside. The extent to which this can be done depends upon the perform-ance of the Scottish economy as a whole, which means in the tirst instance onthe performance of Central Scotland.170. The way in which the rest of the country can be drawn into a fullyinterlocking programme with Central Scotland is discussed in the next Chapter.Here it is enough to point out that each of the studies reveals how clear thefuture interdependence must be.The Borders171. The study covered the counties of Berwickshire, Roxburghshire,Selkirkshire and Peeblesshire and the Langholm district of Dumfriesshire inScotland; and the northern part of Northumberland lying within the lowerTweed valley.172. Analysis brought out an essential distinction between the Eastern Area roughly Berwickshire and the part of North Northumberland included in the study and the Western Area comprising Roxburghshire, Selkirkshire andPeeblesshire. In both, the study revealed that depopulation had produced muchmore serious and advanced problems than in any other area examined.173. The economy of the Eastern Area is predominantly rural and agri-culturally based, dependent on a basic industry in which improved efficiencywill inevitably result in a continuing fall in employment. The population isdispersed, with Berwick-upon-Tweed (12,000) the only town of any size to actas a shopping and service centre for a population of some 30,000. In theWestern Area, on the other hand, almost 40 per cent of the insured population is employed in manufacturing industry and over three-quarters of the popula-tion is urban in character. This distinction has an important bearing on the kindof action which is appropriate to each area.The Eastern Area174. If present trends continue the Eastern Area will lose between 5,000 and,000 people through emigration over the next ten years. Of this loss about1,000 is likely to come from Berwick-upon-Tweed where continuing depopula-tion could soon begin to undermine the position of the town as an importantservice centre for a very wide area.175. As the population of its hinterland declines there is a case for ensuring that Berwick can itself retain a sufficient level of population and vitality to goon carrying out its function efficiently. The development of a growing source ofemployment on a sufficient scale to counteract and reduce continuing losses of population would be the main objective of such a policy. This is unlikely to takeplace spontaneously. There is already some manufacturing industry in Berwick,although it provides employment for less than 1,000 workers. Almost a third ofthis employment is in branch factories of the main Border textile industries,forced to go to Berwick in search of female labour. As in the Western Area,female labour is now scarce and any new industrial growth would have to be

accompanied by a deliberate policy of housing and population expansion andto mobilise the full travel to work potential of its labour catchment area.176. The town itself and its surroundings are attractive. It has space for industry and housing; and is situated on main lines of communication. It hasample water resources, clean air, and being situated near the sea, can use riverwater with the least damage to fishing and amenity interests, and the problemsof effluent disposal are reduced. These are assets currently in great demand.Also the harbour could be a useful means of bringing in raw materials such astimber. Some small-scale industries established in recent years have done well,and it is noteworthy that some of them food processing, for example servenational rather than local markets.177. The important point about any action to improve the condition of theEastern Area is that it really should work for the benefit of the area as a whole.A location where some variety of employment and demonstrable availability of labour can be built up has the best chance of operating in this way, bothby inducing sufficient young people to stay, and by attracting incoming in-dustry. On this reckoning also Berwick-upon-Tweed is the obvious place forthe first concentration of effort, and as the focus of communications it can drawon a wide catchment area.The Western Area178. If present trends continue, there is likely to be a further loss to theWestern Area of some 8,000 people by emigration over the next ten years,most of them from the towns. Depopulation on this scale is likely to lead to areduction of nearly 4\ thousand in the population of working age, and a short-tall of some 7,000 in relation to labour demand by 1973, even when allowance has been made for the decline in agricultural employment. Without a wider range of employment opportunity, especially for men, there will be no social or economic force strong enough to retard the heavy outward migration of peopleof working age, with all the consequent effects on existing industry, on the structure of the remaining population, and on the standard of service, social, and cultural facilities.179. Both branches of the dominant textile industry are thus subject to difficulties which they can themselves now only marginally and temporarilyaffect. Equally, diversification of employment is unlikely to occur of its own accord. Jedburgh, sometimes quoted as an example of the way in which localenterprise can prevail against the tide, is atypical and can be misleading. Theburgh had the benefit of immigration for the North British Rayon company in the thirties to give it a much more healthy population structure than the border norm. It was the consequent availability of housing and remains of the pool of male labour after the closure of this firm which made the establishmentof a new engineering industry possible. This situation has been repeated in noother town in the Western Area, and the continued decline in the populationof the whole Area would in the long term simply increase the dependence ofthe remaining population on a narrowing range of employment opportunities,dominated by the hosiery industry based in Hawick.180. There are at present some 73,000 people living within 15 miles ofGalashiels: this is a sizeable labour catchment on which to build. If it is allowedto dwindle, so will the opportunity of preserving and building upon it. This iswhere the real case for action lies. Though it rests in part on the economic

and social needs of the area itself, it rests equally on the opportunity of mobilis-ing this existing industrial base more fully and building upon it as part of thegeneral expansion of the Scottish economy.181. The necessary changes to set the area on the path to expansion can onlybe brought about by a substantial and integrated programme of housing, new industry and the introduction of new population. In considering the scale ofaction required, the objective must in the first place be to establish conditionsthat will permit self-sustaining population growth and a predictable formationof labour. The estimated shortfall in the supply of labour to meet likely demand by 1973 provides a yardstick.182. Analysis suggests that a population increase of some 25,000 over thenext 10-15 years (a net inward movement of some 17,000 if the net outwardemigration of 8,000 can be held in the area) is about the minimum that couldbroaden the range of employment opportunities significantly for both malesand females. Expansion on this scale would only slightly improve the relation-ship between male and fenmie employment and the importance of male employ-ing industry in this context cannot therefore be emphasised too strongly; butassuming a continuance of present high activity rates it would add over 11,000people of working age to the labour force of the Western Area. An increase on thisscaleis also about the largest that could reasonably be achieved in the time. Itwould require, for an area of this size, a very considerable and rapid building programme.183. By building more houses in each of the burghs it might be possible toimprove the labour situation marginally, but in the end this alone would be insufficient unless something were also done to meet the basic economic and social weaknesses of the situation. A more fundamental solution will require a geographic, economic, social and cultural focus to be supplied for the popula-tion of the whole Western Area. A range of employment and the facilities of modern living could then gradually be built up and improved on a scale not now found in any individual town. Equally the conditions of success for anysubstantial introduction of new industry and indeed for investment in im-proved services call for a location which can draw on the widest possiblecatchment. These two conditions, the rapid creation of a substantial focus, andcentrality, are likely to be fulfilled most easily by concentrating the bulk of any increase in population and employment on expansion of an existing town.Galashiels, centre of the largest available labour catchment and second largesttown in the area, is the most suitable choice. Accompanied by increases in thehouse-building rate of the other towns in the area, the rapid expansion ofGalashiels is the best way to begin building the regional economic centre whichis needed.184. This would be the first step. A further advantage of Galashiels, from aphysical planning point of view, is that it offers the possibility of linear expan-sion, through an area of high amenity which would be a great and much-neededasset to urban Scotland, to the other focal point of the area, St. Boswells. Herein the longer term, when faster growth has been established, are the conditions for very considerable further development.South-West Scotland185. The study covered the counties of Wigtownshire, Kirkcudbright andDumfriesshire, with the Branch Employment Office Areas of Girvan and Cum-

onock in Ayrshire. The Langholm district of Dumfriesshire was examined in the borders study.186. The question which gives rise to most concern is the steadily increasing unemployment, particularly in the far west. However, Sanquhar, Cumnock,Girvan and Stranraer, four of the most seriously affected areas, have allsucceeded in attracting new industry as a result of the inducements provided byDevelopment District status. Newton Stewart, the other area with relatively high unemployment, was made a Development District in May, 1965.187. Though migration and rural depopulation exists on a scale which in places exceeds that of the Eastern Borders, it has so far created neither theproblems nor the volume of local concern to be found in Berwickshire and north Northumberland. Indeed, some of the larger service towns notablyStranraer and Girvan and forestry villages in Wigtownshire and Kirkcud-brightshire are holding their own. Rising incomes and these stable pockets of population have meant that shopkeepers and merchants do not have theemptying tills which clearly account for so much disquiet in Border towns and villages where population is falling sharply.188. Again, in the Dumfries-Annan area there is moderate growth of population and moderate growth in employment of a diverscd character. Thereis neither the acute labour shortage found in the western Borders, nor the very limited range of employment opportunities.189. This pattern of concentration which is emerging in the South-Westis likely to remain functionally valid for as far ahead as one can see. Thegrowth of employment opportunities in Cumnock and Sanquhar can drawtogether on one of the main lines of communication from Dumfries to Kil-marnock population and employment that was hitherto more widely scattered.The same is true of Girvan and Stranraer. Also Stranraer must continue to be important because of its transit function for Northern Ireland traffic and asa valuable service centre for a wide and rather remote hinterland. It is thereforeright that investment in the far west should be concentrated on it to ensurethat it can draw to itself a range of employment that can work for its hinterlandand make it reasonably self-supporting. Finally, growth in and around Dumfriesis enhancing the value of a remarkably strong regional centre.190. Excluding the Cumnock area, which with its immigration associatedwith mining is a special case, the region as a whole has been losing populationfor a long time. The population structure is ageing. Even if some of the smallercommunities are still holding their own for the time being, it seems inevitable that, in due course, the high rate of natural increase will be undermined and a process of sharper decline set in. In some places this thinning out of populationmight not be very serious. But in Stranraer it would. Also, if the rural population in the Newton Stewart and Kirkcudbright area declined too rapidly, there could well be difficulty in meeting the employment needs of the forestry in-dustry as its jobs mature towards the end of this century. This suggests that thegrowth of Stranraer should be encouraged with greater determination, if pos-sible with the introduction of more people from outside the area altogether.It also suggests that some special attention be paid to preventing too sharp adecline in the population of the Newton Stewart and Kirkcudbright areas totide them over until forestry employment rises.

191. The question of the Dumfries area is of more national importance. It is growing, but not fast enough at present to contribute significantly to Scottishprospects. Physically it offers excellent long-term prospects with Lockerbie.Annan and Carlisle for very large development on a metropolitan scale. Thecore of the Solway region lies on the main road and rail communications between england and Scotland and in a situation well placed to exploit Scottish, north of England and Irish markets. Environmentally is one of the most attractiveof the really large sites left in Britain which are suitable for a new conurbation.The Government are already investigating the potable water resources thatwould be made available by a Solway barrage; yet clearly no large populationexpansion can emerge from the intrinsic pressures operating within the regionitself. The need for and phasing of long-term development of this kind can onlybe programmed by reference to the phasing of Scottish expansion generally andthe long-term distribution of United Kingdom population growth.192. In all the principal centres of the South-West much consolidation and expansion can come from holding more of the high natural increase of the region in the region. But when so many higher school leavers have to go awayfor further education and training, it is only natural that many of the moreskilled employees will need to be recruited from outside. Interdependence withthe rest of the country must increase. More people could come from Glasgowunder overspill arrangements, which must be worked with more persistancethan in the past, and with a greater readiness to make arrangements to ensurethat a house is available to the incoming worker immediately. But the necessityremains that in the future far more people should be drawn from any area andbe able to get houses quickly in support of economic growth.193. One other subject of importance to the South-West must be mentionedtourism. The traditional holiday industry in the area is not well adapted to meetthe demands that are going over the next few years to be made upon it still lessexploit them as opportunities. The South-West will be much more readilyaccessible to the North of England after the completion of M.6 in the earlyseventies. Yet the fullness of hotels and boarding houses in the coastal resortsin the holiday season was advanced repeatedly during consultations as an indication that the limit of capacity had been reached. Obviously considerablescope exists for more and better accommodation, not necessarily of a luxurykind, and for more and better camping and caravan sites. Here quality oflandscaping and planning are important and the Forestry Commission have arole to play in creating new standards in these matters, having access to sitesof unrivalled beauty and seclusion. Not all the Galloway Coast is suitable forbathing and any more determined development of the region for tourism may need to be accompanied by expenditure on sea water bathing pools or thecreation of safe bathing stations. There is little doubt too that the recreationsof fishing and sailing (the latter well adapted to the growth in favour of areas for &apos;second houses&apos;) could be developed. Altogether the picture is one ofconsiderable scope, with good accessibility, and within a manageable compass.North-East Scotland194. The study area included the counties of Angus, Kincardincshire,Aberdeenshire, Banffshire, Morayshire, Nairn and most of Perthshire. Nairn,and the parts of Morayshire, Aberdeenshire and Perthshire which are contiguousto the Highlands were also considered in the Highlands and Islands Study.

195. The problems and characteristics of the Dundee Area, with Perth andStrathmore, are quite distinct from those of Aberdeen, the north-east coast,and their hinterland. They are accordingly considered separately. Likewise theareas contiguous to the Highlands are best, treated on their own.The Dundee Area196. The general condition and prospects of the Dundee Area, and par-ticularly of the city itself, offer the most promising feature of the whole North-East. The area is not without problems. Net outward migration is substantial,and is largely confined to the younger age groups. Jute, the source of so manyof the area&apos;s difficulties in the past, is still the largest single sector of employ-ment. Even if the rationalisation which the industry has undergone has given it more stability and a welcome increase in the proportion of males engaged, it isnot likely to expand further and in the long-term is almost certain to reduce itslabour demands. Outside Dundee, many of the smaller towns, the traditionalservice centres for an agricultural hinterland which has been able to shedlabour particularly rapidly, are showing signs of decline in an ageing populationstructure and reducing rate of natural increase and fertility.197. But despite this, Dundee itself has an impressive record of post-warsuccesses in modern fast growing industries and now has a substantial labour force skilled in the requirements of precision engineering. Some of these new developments were the result of the equivalent of Development District statusduring the immediate post-war period of industrial steering. They prove that industry of the kind most needed by Scotland has found Dundee a satisfactorylocation. Both to anticipate any further contraction in jute and capitalise on itsdemonstrable success Dundee, and on a smaller scale Arbroath, suggest them-selves as the places which merit priority for development in the short-term.198. The future of Perth and the Strathmore towns is closely allied to thefortunes of Dundee. Although traditionally they have shown considerableindependence of the city considerable regional interdependence is now evident.This must increase, and the greater the economic strength of Dundee the more the other towns are likely to benefit. Several of them are well within travel towork distance and together have a pattern of distribution and communications which affords an excellent basis for a new metropolitan sub-region of the kinddescribed in Chapter VIII.199. The longer-term prospect endorses this picture still more. The analysis of Dundee&apos;s present economy lends much support to the view that, if its popula-tion could steadily be increased to somewhere near a quarter of a million, itwould begin to take on an altogether more powerfully metropolitan character,which would generate a greater and more self-sustaining range of employment and amenities. Not all the expansion should necessarily take place in Dundee.With the more rapid development of the city itself will go a strengthening of the economies of North Fife, Perth, Arbroath and the Strathmore towns to exploit the natural advantages of city-region scale which the whole area offers. This willmake the most of short inter-urban lines of communication to mobilise the widest possible labour catchment. It will also help to put right the area&apos;s weakestfeature the demographic instability now being shown by some of the Strath-more towns which were formerly heavily dependent on textiles and on servicingan agriculture which has shed labour particularly rapidly.

The analysis of Dundee&apos;s present economy lends much support to the view that, if its popula-tion could steadily be increased to somewhere near a quarter of a million, itwould begin to take on an altogether more powerfully metropolitan character,which would generate a greater and more self-sustaining range of employment and amenities. Not all the expansion should necessarily take place in Dundee.With the more rapid development of the city itself will go a strengthening of the economies of North Fife, Perth, Arbroath and the Strathmore towns to exploit the natural advantages of city-region scale which the whole area offers. This willmake the most of short inter-urban lines of communication to mobilise the widest possible labour catchment. It will also help to put right the area&apos;s weakestfeature the demographic instability now being shown by some of the Strath-more towns which were formerly heavily dependent on textiles and on servicingan agriculture which has shed labour particularly rapidly.

200. In the early years the consolidation of the employment structure coulddraw very largely on the labour resources of the area itself from the possiblecontraction in jute employment, further labour shedding by agriculture, and thereduction of net emigration. Longer term expansion should see net migrationturn to an inward flow.The Aberdeen Area201. Much the heaviest net migration in the North-East comes from theAberdeen Area. It comprises some of the best labour in Scotland and most of it&quot;overflies&apos; the central belt, going direct to England and overseas. Employment,heavily slanted to the primary industries of agriculture and fishing together withtheir ancillaries and services, is very static in character. Manufactures, thoughvaried, are lightly represented and post-war development has been slow particularly in Aberdeen itself.203. Given this very static economy, opportunities for employment and enterprise are in most places narrow: the more ambitious and energetic are thefirst to go. Agriculture, with its high proportion of small farms, is likely in thefuture to shed population heavily; and the prospects for the fishing industry willnot call for any increase in the labour force. There is little to suggest that present trends will not continue, or even accelerate. This could gradually under-mine the favourable natural increase and fertility that have so far given stabilityto most of the main communities.204. The first step is therefore to ensure continuance of the present healthypopulation structure and natural increase. This in itself should produce con-ditions which will steadily widen and strengthen the employment structure ofthe area and allow faster expansion in due course. For it must be recognised thatthe existing labour base in Aberdeen does not offer the same opportunity forrapid expansion as that in the Dundee area.205. Aberdeen itself is the first and most important place on which to con-concentrate. It is a very substantial centre of population, a university city, and a place of high amenity and great character. Its influence is strong as far westas Elgin. Clearly priority should be given to the expansion of employment opportunities in the city, in order to use in situ, as it were, some of the skilled and versatile labour which is so highly esteemed in England.206. Because of the relatively limited travel-to-work catchment on which itcan draw (Stonehaven to the south, Banchory to the west, Invcruric and Ellonto the north, mark its effective limits), concentration on the city still leaves along coast and extensive hinterland to consider. Both are fairly thickly settled and an attempt will need to be made through concentration on selected centresto draw on local labour catchment areas more effectively than at present. Thedemographic health of the principal communities is such that this would bewell worth while. The opportunity still remains, as in parts of the South-West,to concentrate some of the drift from the land in the towns which offer the best chance of growing. For demographic, geographical and labour catchmentreasons, the most promising places on which to concentrate have been identified as Elgin, Buckie, Keith, Huntly, Banff/Macduff, Fraserburgh and above allPeterhead which has already done very well since the war and is now growing.207. It is envisaged that in Aberdeen, and the smaller towns mentioned, themore systematic use of advance factories would be matched with the planned

forward provision of housing. This would give evidence of a predictable forma-tion of labour at key locations which would go a long way to overcome thenatural feeling among industrialists that the area is too remote. Indeed the example of Peterhead and Fraserburgh shows what can be done.208. Tentative estimates of the possible run down in agriculture and fishing,and the consequences of this on the towns, suggest that increases in urban popula-tion, with matching employment opportunities, of some 20.000 would be desirableover the next ten years to offset long-term effects on the demography of thearea. This build-up might be split between the city and a selection of the largertowns mentioned, the former probably taking the larger share. Success in apolicy of this kind could mean that in the long-term the industrial labour forceof the area would be sufficiently improved, and natural increase still sufficientlybuoyant, that more ambitious expansion could follow.The Areas Contiguous to the Highlands209. In the upland areas contiguous to the Crofting Counties the best pros-pects for maintaining at least a viable level of population and employment is in developing the complementary industries of tourism and forestry. The expansion in the Forestry Commission^ Highland planting programme has considerableimpact at its fringes on these areas and, if a satisfactory rate of land acquisitioncan be maintained, employment should successfully offset run-down in agri-culture. If the small towns become the focus for investment and concentration of services, their future augmented by tourism and a growing popularity asplaces for retirement should be reasonably secure.The Highlands and Islands210. The study of the Highlands and Islands covered the seven croftingcounties of Zetland, Orkney, Caithness, Sutherland, Ross and Cromarty,Inverness and Argyll, together with certain Contiguous areas&apos;. These were, in north-East Scotland, north and west Perthshire and the upland parts of AngusAberdeenshire, Banffshire, Moray and Nairn the whole of the Grampianswere therefore considered; and the county of Bute, with its affinities with southern Argyll, was also included.211. The Highlands and Islands are very different from any other region ofthe U.K. Much earlier work on them takes this difference as a reason for treatingthe region as something sui generis, justifying its own set of standards andinsulation from criteria applied elsewhere in Britain. This tendency has been fedboth by Highland feeling itself and hardly less by outside sentiment which would preserve a distinctive Highland way of life. Undeniable benefits have been wonas a result of special treatment. But it is arguable that in the long run the highlands have lost more than they have gained.212. The study made by the Scottish Economic Planning Council and theBoard attempted to apply the same economic criteria as were employed in theother study areas; to limit examination rigorously to those elements which offeredsome possibility of being integrated with the economy of the United Kingdom asa whole; and to determine which economic and social objectives were worthspending resources on. The resulting view offers the possibility of consolidationand progress on new lines, which could serve as a guide to the Highlands and islands Development Board and to future policy generally.

213. Although it is often forgotten that over two-fifths of the Highlandpopulation live in settlements of over 1,000 persons, of which the largest are set in essentially lowland-type conditions, it is nevertheless true that the regiongenerally shows in an extreme form the way in which the primary industries ofagriculture and fishing, which must employ fewer people if incomes are to bemaintained and expanded, can no longer support on their own a self-sustainingsocial and economic life. This has led to advanced social decay in many outlyingcommunities and demographic imbalance in virtually all but the main centres of population. The Crofters&apos; Commission is trying to rationalise crofting and sokeep up the necessarily gradual move to larger and more viable units, butagricultural improvement may in one sense exacerbate the problem. For thereduction of numbers to the extent which produces a tolerable return makes the likelihood of social and demographic vitality that much more remote. However,agriculture and an improved fishing industry will continue to be essential to theHighland economy and, even if they afford less employment, stability based onincreased efficiency could, if carefully directed, help to strengthen selectedcommunities.214. Analysis has shown that there are many towns and some rural areas where the numbers, ages and fertility of the population are likely to provide a sound demographic basis for development; and that if new jobs continued to arise in and around centres of this kind on the scale they have done since the start of the Dounreay development, or at Fort William, the total population will fall very little if at all.215. Moreover, in terms of natural resources the region has three assets which, if thoroughly exploited, offer some possibility of sustaining enough jobs.The first is the suitability of very much more of its land than is yet afforested asthe basis of a timber industry. The second is its space and physical beauty fortourism and recreation. The third is the combination of space, water supplies,deep-water harbours and certain labour reserves which, even if limited in num-bers, could be tapped and built on. Together these can in time provide a base for a special type of manufacturing industry.216. The long-term employment prospects from forestry and its ancillariesand the generating effect this would have on employment in service industry could lead to stability at a number of important centres which would then serve as anchor-points for much of the mainland. For the Highlands more forestryand forest-based industries are both practicable and the main productivealternative to the region continuing, perhaps increasingly, to be economicallydependent on state subvention.217. Both forestry and tourism can utilise a dispersed local population fortheir labour and resident services which would otherwise be increasingly difficult to obtain. But this is not to say they should be regarded as pretexts forshoring up decaying communities. Rather the reverse. It should make concentra-tion in viable though necessarily still sometimes fairly remote units a good dealeasier to achieve. For example, the growth of forestry employment along withthe creation of family farms in central Sutherland could make the concentrationthere of population from some of the very seriously run-down communities of western Sutherland a practical proposition. The main benefits in the form ofsawmilling, transport, and any possible pulping plants would be located in thelarger centres anyway, which would inevitably tend to draw in population fromthe hinterland. For tourism, the provision of a complex of facilities of the kind

now growing up in Aviemore/Coylumbridge, essential not only for the fullexploitation of snow-fields, but also for the range of wet-weather diversionsnecessary to the summer tourist, are a powerful force for the concentration of population and employment and could offer in the long-term the real possibilityof some small industrial growth.218. There is also a special sense in which the development of recreational facilities in the Highlands is really a complementary part of revitalising the economy of Central Scotland. For the existence of the Highlands on the door-step, as it were, constitutes one of the great attractions to living and working inlowland Scotland something greatly enhanced with modern communications and must be regarded as one side of the general effort to make the total Scottishenvironment competitive with the more prosperous parts of the U.K.219. For the third prospect, manufacturing industry, past experience points to several notable successes but emphasises many limitations. The examples oftweed in Lewis, the aluminium industry in Lochabcr now followed by thepulp mill and Dounreay in Caithness show clearly enough that major develop-ments can take place and that they can hold or increase population on a con-siderable scale. In the case of Lewis, the combined benefit of numbers of peopleclose to a substantial town like Stornoway, together with vigorous managementsare the secret of the tweed industry\s success. While this may not be repeatablein any other crofting community except perhaps on a more modest scale withthe Shetland knitting industry, it might in some of the other large labourcatchment areas of the Highlands. The earliest industrial community in the highlands, in Lochaber, is now assured of prolonged and greatly expandedgrowth.220. There has been no net growth in manufacturing employment in the last10-15 years but jobs in firms which closed have at least been offset by the substantial number of new enterprises which have been set up, with the help ofthe Local Employment Acts and other funds, notably in the Inverness/Inver-gordon area. Most of these are based on local resources or skills. The outlook forthis kind of manufacture is good. But the scarcity of immigrant firms emphasises the limited success in attracting general industry to this area in competition with more orthodox locations. An industry with a high value to weight product cansucceed in this location and indeed a good many do provided there is sufficient managerial ability behind it. This, however, is one of the region&apos;sweaknesses and it is significant that although there is a good flow of localapplicants interested in starting businesses many of them fail through sheerlack of training in book-keeping and other aspects of business management.221. It is sometimes urged that industry and tourism will spoil the Highlands.This need not be so, and is really part of the romantic double-think that wouldenjoy the Highlands, but deny them the means of life. The industrial scale at most, even in the long term, a couple of pulp mills, a handful of large factories and rather more smaller ones, few of them visually offensive is small inrelation to the large area and good planning can ensure that industries fit into their environment. The number of tourist centres of a major kind is also likely tobe very small, and if well designed should humanise rather than disfigure the places in which they are situated. These are ways in which the growing volumeof people likely to come to the Highlands can be more successfully absorbed into the landscape.

222. So the guidelines of a Highland policy derived from economic criteria,which will serve as a frame of reference for the Highlands and Islands Develop-ment Board, will be: first, a policy of concentration on objectives worthinvesting in, on the points identified as centres of the main labour catchmentareas and on those villages and townships in the hinterland which offer the best hope of viability; secondly, the development of forestry and forestry-basedindustries to give in the long-term the core of employment in much of the region;thirdly, the complementary development of tourism both to assist consolidationin some of the main centres and give a supplementary income to the dispersedpopulation engaged in primary and service industry; and finally, the continueddevelopment of indigenous manufacturing industry, large and small andperseverance in attracting outsiders. In the period before a forestry-basedindustry really becomes established, a modest intermediate expansion of manu-facturing employment will also be necessary to ensure that the populationstructure of the region does not run down to an extent which would jeopardise the ultimate supply of labour on an adequate site.

Chapter XTHE STRATEGY OF DEVELOPMENT223. Many more jobs; much less net migration from Scotland: a better spread of opportunity throughout the country; and a better environment. These arethe strategic aims. This chapter describes the pattern of development needed to achieve them.General224. Jobs and population are interdependent. As Chapter 11 has shown, thepopulation of Scotland in 1970 is expected to be over 100,000 more than it wasin 1964. In the longer term the population of the U.K. is expected by the endof this century to have risen by 20 million to a total of some 70 million. IfScotland is to take its share of this increase, its population could rise by anythingfrom If to 2 million by half a million by 1980 and by over a million between1980 and the year 2000.&quot;225. Expansion on this scale with consequent redeployment will make sub-stantial calls on the space available throughout Scotland; and action must betaken now to create a climate favourable to development at suitable locationsin the areas which lie outside the central belt. The more promising elements inthe economies of these areas, described in Chapter IX, must be steadilystrengthened, and measures to offset declining trends must be put in hand.226. The rapid expansion of population and industry in any area requiresconsiderable preparatory work, much of which must be begun some years inadvance; and it can in the end take place more rapidly if there is a sizeableindustrial base on which to build. For this reason proposals outlined in this chapter contain elements designed to widen the industrial base of those places in any part of Scotland which are likely to play an important part in the future.At the same time they will enable the more substantial country towns to actas modern service centres for the rural population.A Practical Programme227. The programme sets out to exploit to the full the favourable trendsalready present in the economy, of the kind discussed in earlier chapters; andsimilarly to exploit investment made or committed in communications, water supplies, air services and major developments in private industry. Thus M.74,M.8, the Forth, Tay, and Erskine Bridges, Abbotsinch Airport, the electrificationof the Glasgow-Gourock line, the Loch Lomond Water Scheme, the motor industry, and the Fort William Pulp Mill are examples of developments whosepotential will be used to the utmost in creating the conditions in which newemployment can flourish. Likewise the Government will see that the favourable conditions of existing &quot;large labour markets receive the fullest exploitation con-sistent with the improvement of the physical and social environment.228. The Government will make purposeful and co-ordinated use of the keyinstruments of policy available to them. The most important are industrialsteering and the inducements operated by the Board of Trade; the training,re-training schemes and transfer grants operated by the Ministry of Labour;and the housing programme, particularly the portion represented by the New

Towns and the Scottish Special Housing Association (and the private sector for owner-occupation).229. What the Government are setting out to do is to reconcile the need forthe early increase of employment and population in Central Scotland described in Chapter VIII with laying the foundations of future expansion in the mainregional centres described in Chapter IX. Present decisions have therefore tobe taken in the light of the long-term needs of the country. This makes the evolution of a proper strategy a matter of careful phasing, which can allowmajor decisions affecting the development of new resources to be taken in good time.The Programme 1966 1970Central Scotland230. The first phase, to 1970, will see the continued and rapid expansion ofthose places in Central Scotland which have the benefit of complexes of newfast growing industries, and which are well placed in relation to communications and services. These include the four existing new towns, with. Irvine where theGovernment have announced that a fifth is to be established, and such areas asGreater Livingston, Falkirk/Grangemouth, North Lanarkshire, and CentralFife-which is already benefiting from the stimulus of the Forth Road Bridge,and also Dundee which increasingly requires to be considered in the generalcontext of Central Scotland. During this phase certain new areas of development will be opened up. Examples of these schemes, which could start to become effective in the last two years of the decade, are likely to be at such places asErskine, to the West of Larkhall near the interchange with the Hamilton BypassMotorway, Lennoxtown and the south-eastern environs of Edinburgh.231. For the whole of this expansion the role of the local authorities will beof the first importance. They will provide the bulk of the housing, and theservices and educational facilities to match the sharp rise in local populations.But activity will not be confined to primary centres of growth, for in the moreconfident and expansionist climate which will develop from a real reduction of migration and corresponding rise in employment it will be possible for enter-prising local authorities throughout Central Scotland substantially to improve their position. As redevelopment proceeds and other reminders of the olderindustrial past are removed it will be possible for new employment opportunities to occur in places not hitherto thought of as in the mainstream of growth.The Borders232. The towns in the Western Borders are already so seriously threatenedthat their demographic and industrial recovery calls for the introduction ofsome 25,000 people by 1980 at the latest. The Study suggested that to obtainthe maximum advantage this should be concentrated in a way which would turn Galashiels into a more sizeable centre of population than at present exists in the Borders. This would afford the first stage of a more sustained expansionleading eventually to further spontaneous growth. The injection of population on this scale into an area with such limited resources calls for a novel co-ordinated programme.233. It is accordingly proposed to appoint a Planning Consultant forthwith to identify the main possible lines of development and their locations. The

Consultant will be asked to act in consultation with the local authorities andthe Scottish Development Department and submit his report within 18 months.234. Meanwhile, in order to make an immediate start with housing develop-ment, provision will be made within the Scottish housing programme for anextension of Galashiels south of the Tweed towards Darnick. This is intendedto comprise up to 1,000 houses to be completed by the end of 1970.235. A third important feature of the programme will be the exploitation of the potential industrial sites near Galashiels. The Government will consider in consultation with the local authorities possible means, including building of advanced factories by which this can best be accomplished. The diversificationof the industrial structure in the Borders necessarily with a male-employingslant is a primary objective.236. The provision of new housing, which will be available to all-comers,on the scale proposed would also be of the greatest assistance to the woollen and knitwear industries which are short of labour. The combined effect of theseproposals will be to enable the Borders for the first time to see the steady andpredictable growth of a new labour force.237. In the Eastern Border area, in order to arrest the trends of populationdecline, it will also be necessary to attract new industrial enterprises which willoffer additional job opportunities for males. This will be phased as part of thearea&apos;s social development in which supporting local authority services, especiallyhousing, will match the needs of the expanding population.23S. The Development Commission have in mind the establishment of sucha programme of concentrated assistance and development in co-operation with local authorities and the local development association. On the industrial sidethis will involve among other things the provision of advance factory space.Berwick-on-Tweed is the natural focal point and the place best able to drawon the maximum labour potential. It is probable that in its early stages develop-ment will be concentrated there: but the aim of the programme will be to benefit the area as a whole and to ensure that expansion at any one point will havea revitalising effect on the surrounding districts.North-East: Dundee Area239. Of equal importance is the Perth- Dundee area of the North-East. thoughfor somewhat different reasons. Dundee itself has considerable affinities withthe Central Belt. It contains, like the west of Scotland or the Lothians, elementswhich could support rapid expansion and would here phase-in particularlyvaluably with the possible contraction in jute employment and the needs ofPerth and the depopulating hinterland. With its record of post-war successes in modern fast-growing industries the city now has a substantial labour forceskilled in the requirements of precision engineering and the management know-how as well. Physically also it is well suited to expansion, with its excellentlydisposed industrial estates and ring road; and with Perth and the towns ofStrathmore and the coast it forms the centre of a potential modern city region.Here, in other words is an opportunity to be seized both to achieve quicklypart of the all-Scotland growth target and to take a useful step towards solvingregional difficulties. The Corporation in their development plan envisage anincrease of some 13,000 in the city&apos;s population, and it is proposed that thisshould be facilitated as rapidly as possible. Meanwhile the Board of Trade areacquiring more land for industrial development.

North-East: Aberdeen Area240. The employment structure in the Aberdeen area places some restriction,in the short-term, on expansion. But it is reasonable to expect Aberdeen itself-much the most important regional feature to provide for some growth of population. Accordingly the Board of Trade have decided to acquire land for new development.241. By focusing the main provision of new housing and employment inthe demographically healthier and from the point of view of their labourcatchments geographically better-placed towns of the hinterland such as,Elgin, Buckie, Banff/Macduff, Fraserburgh and above all Peterhead- it shouldbe possible to establish an adequate spread of service centres large enough to sustain some growth. If this can be done there is some chance that the area would have a sufficient accumulation of population, services and skill for the subsequent launching of a more substantial expansion.The South- West242. On a smaller scale the South-West presents a similar picture to theAberdeen hinterland. Its greatest potential the metropolitan-scale capacity ofthe Solway basin is for the long term. This is one of the places that in the closing decade of the century might well, from Dumfries to Carlisle and theSouth Solway coast, take a large new development of city si/e. At present the region is succeeding in retaining in the Dumfries/Annan area some of its owndrift from the land; and elsewhere, at Girvan, Stranraer and at Cumnock andSanquhar current policies have already established a concentration of servicesand employment of the kind it will be necessary to supply in the Aberdeenhinterland. Provided these policies are continued these sub-centres should notdecline, and the Dumfries/Annan area should grow in useful anticipation of subsequent more rapid and substantial expansion.Highlands and Islands243. The Highlands and Islands, as the region most remote from the CentralBeit, are at first glance the most difficult to link with the developing lines ofindustrialisation. But as the study showed, forestry and tourism offer prospects for the region to achieve an economy based on its regional resources and, as explained in Chapter VI, the Government has decided on a substantial increasein the Forestry Commission^ planting programme. In the long-term the environment of the Beauly and Cromarty Firths is likely to become increasinglyattractive to industry and to draw in population from other parts of the country.In the meantime this area requires endorsing, along with the collecting points of certain other significant labour catchments notably Wick/Thurso and FortWilliam as offering special prospects of development in the future. The more immediate problem in the difficult western fringes and the islands will be to identify and develop viable communities to form holding points and, possibly,centres of modest expansion. This is a task to which the Highlands and IslandsDevelopment Board will be giving close attention.The Longer Term244. Between 1970 and 1980 the main developments in Central Scotland,especially in the Greater Livingston area, in North-Ayrshire and the EdinburghCity region (including Fife) will build up rapidly. At this stage there will be

completely new developments in the improvement of communications, especiallyroads. These will in turn facilitate the start and more rapid extension of majordevelopments further afield. By 1980 the introduction of 25.000 more people to the Western Borders should be completed, and the area be in a position to expand still more rapidly. Dundee should have been significantly enlarged, andthe position of Dumfries reinforced.245. From 1980 to the end of the century further major improvements incommunications will permit the exploitation of the more promising areas safe-guarded by the earlier holding and consolidation operations notably theAberdeen area and the Beauly/Cromarty Firth area. It should also then bepossible to consider much more massive development of the Solvvay region aspart of the long-term deployment of the U.K. population.246. The proposals for the short-term, to 1970. are therefore part of a long-term strategy designed to exploit developing lines of communication and antici-pate the demands which long-term population trends will make on the space ofthe country. The proposals for Central Scotland should ensure that the vitalchanges in the balance of the country&apos;s industrial economy can take place,while migration will be substantially reduced. And the proposals for the restof the country should ensure that healthier economic conditions will prevail infuture. They will help build up fewer but more viable service centres; in Dundeeand the surrounding towns produce a really considerable nexus of industrial employment; and in the Borders create a new one.Interdependence247. An emerging theme throughout this strategy is the interdependence ofthe outer regions and Central Scotland.248. The importance of Central Scotland in the early stages has been explainedand as the main industrial centres in the regions begin to gather momentum itmay be expected that the interchange of population and skill will greatly increase.Just as the net migration from Scotland is the product of two much larger grossmovements, so is the net decline of population in the outer regions the product,even now, of a similar substantial two-way movement. And as opportunitiesincrease at the main centres in Dundee, Aberdeen, Inverness and Dumfriesfor example so must the net inward movement of workers, technicians andmanagers increase as well. In a situation of more freely available housing, the steady improvement of employment prospects and better communications, thedevelopment of the regions is likely to be achieved more through their ownattractiveness to the enterprising than by the more formal arrangements for importing population under overspill agreements.Environment249. Finally the prosperity and guaranteed growth of population offered bythe proposals will give much greater impetus to the improvement of environment and the embodiment of higher physical planning standards than have beenpossible in all but a few particularly favoured places since the war. Already,however, the way in which an increase of population in Central Scotland can make possible better standards of urban renewal transportation has been men-tioned in Chapter VIII. Also, as the part of Scotland most affected by industrial

dereliction, this is where the greatest effort in rehabilitation will take place. Forthe rest of the country the proposed Countryside Commission and in the highlands and Islands, the Highlands and Islands Development Board withtheir special role in relation to the co-ordination of land uses will ensure a fuller utilisation of the recreational resources of Seotland&apos;s great assets of spacewhile at the same time conserving its unrivalled heritage of scenic beauty.

Part III.   Essential Supporting ServicesChapter XIHOUSING250. Pre-eminent among all the services required to support modernisation and growth is housing. It has been shown in earlier chapters that without asubstantial component of housing directly linked with economic development the essential objectives of greater labour mobility and reduced outward migra-tion are unattainable; equally, productive efficiency and the higher standards ofliving which must at once accompany and stimulate such efficiency cannot berealised unless there is a massive attack on the social problems of squalor andcongestion. Moreover, house-building is the largest clement of the work of theconstruction industry and. as has been emphasised in the National Plan, apredictable housing programme is a prime necessity for increased productivity in this vital industry.251. The Government have already set out their intentions in The ScottishHousing Programme 1965 to 1970,* published recently. The rate of house-building will be increased with the initial aim of achieving a programme of about50,000 houses a year by 1970, an increase of 40 per cent over the 1964 level.The total programme and its division between the public and private sectorswill be kept under constant review; at present it is expected that in the years immediately ahead in Scotland the private sector will build one house for salefor every three or four provided by the public sector for letting.252. The need for new houses is of two broad types. First, the low standard and the decay of very many of the older houses require their complete rcplace-ment in the shortest possible period. Secondly, there is an existing need for houses to meet shortages that is, for families who at present have to live withrelatives or in lodgings and to this must be added the annual net growth in thenumber of families wanting a home of their own.253. Existing shortages would of course have been greater if emigrationfrom Scotland in recent years had not been so considerable, and success instemming the outflow clearly must increase the number of families for whomhomes need to be provided. But to look at the problem this way is not sufficient:the degree of success in cutting back the rate of net emigration actually depends on homes, as well as work, being made available both to encourage young people to stay in Scotland and to stimulate the inward flow of population.254. To plan for more houses is not enough; the plan must secure that theyare built in the right places. The congestion of much of the older housing whichwill be replaced is such that it will be impossible with reasonable standards of planning and amenity to build the same number of modern homes on theground which has been cleared; and particularly in the case of Glasgow, theremaining replacement houses will have to be built in other areas. This runs in* Cmnd. 2S37.

parallel with the need, already referred to in earlier chapters, for the rapid expansion of industry and population in selected areas as a means of securingeconomic development. The effect will be that the scale of house-buildingneeded at any time will vary substantially from area to area.255. A major difficulty may be to ensure that sufficient houses of suitabletypes are built for sale. The Government consider that there is a large potentialdemand for owner-occupation in Scotland. Building by private enterprise forsale seems to have lagged behind demand, though there has been a gratifyingincrease in the last year or two. A lack of attractive houses for sale to managerialstaff and others who wish to own their homes is always a substantial deterrent to the establishment of new industries in any area, and the availability of suchhouses in areas selected for rapid expansion will be of particular importance.It will be essential to encourage private firms to build in those areas, and toensure that suitable sites are made available to them.256. But the majority of houses built in Scotland in the foreseeable future will be for letting. The local authorities are the main providers of houses to let,especially houses for letting at moderate rents to people who cannot affordeither to buy or to pay the full economic rent of a modern house; and they alonecan carry out the comprehensive redevelopment of congested and decayed areas.Many of them are likely to be very heavily engaged in carrying out these tasksfor the purpose of coping with existing local conditions. It seems certain that insome areas the scale on which house-building is required for the encouragement and support of economic and industrial growth will be beyond the capacity ofthe local authorities concerned.257. In spite of such difficulties for some authorities, it does not follow thatthey can be entirely relieved of responsibility for the housing needs connectedwith industrial expansion. It will be of the utmost importance that the authorities concerned accept in practice the vital necessity for sufficient houses to beprovided in their areas to meet these needs. Where industrial developments takeplace near county or burgh boundaries, the housing may have to be located inother neighbouring areas, and the authorities of these areas also must be pro-pared to accept this necessity. The authorities&apos; co-operation will be needed notonly by their building houses. An excessively local approach to the granting oftenancies of local authority houses especially an insistence on a lengthy periodof residence in the area must impede mobility, and the authorities will haveto be prepared to allocate a substantial proportion of houses to incomers fromother parts of Scotland and from south of the Border. It will also be important that they do everything possible to assist in making land available for house-building by other agencies, including private firms building for owner-occupa-tion, and that they provide the services the houses will require.258. The Government look for the full support of the local authorities in the ways described, but at the same time they consider it appropriate to giveadditional assistance in areas where houses are needed for faster economic growth and the scale is likely to be beyond the capacity of the local authorities concerned. This will be made available in three ways.259. In the first place, the new arrangements for housing subsidies whichwere recently announced are designed to give extra financial help to localauthorities which, by undertaking the substantial programmes already referredto, might find themselves with exceptional financial burdens.

260. Secondly, four areas in Scotland are being developed as new towns, andthe Government have announced their intention of designating a fifth. In these areas the responsibility for house-building is undertaken by the development corporations: they are being encouraged to proceed with the maximum pro-grammes commensurate with their resources.261. Finally, there will be areas in which the rate of build-up will require tobe rapid, and where special efforts will be required to ensure that the scale, paceand quality of housing development matches the prospects ol&quot; industrial growth.In such areas, the Government can ask the Scottish Special Housing association to undertake a building programme. In these areas, as in the Now Towns,houses to let may well need to be provided not only for those for whom localauthority houses are normally intended, but also for some who can afford topay more for housing: and. where this is so the Association can be authorisedto build suitable houses for letting at higher rents. It is intended that for thefuture the Association should devote most ol&quot; its attention to programmes ofthe sort described in this paragraph.262. A programme of 50,000 houses a year by the local authorities, the new towns, the S.S.H.A., private developers and housing associations will be a major undertaking, involving a total outlay of public and private investmentamounting to about  155 m. a year. The steps being taken to achieve it havebeen described more fully in the White Paper already mentioned; its effect onthe future of the construction industry is also referred to in Chapter XV. Thesuccess which attends the various measures which have to be taken will he amain factor in securing the steady economic development with which this paper is concerned.

The task of training the highly qualified men and women, in arts andsciences, on whose insight and skill the future prosperity of Scotland mustlargely depend, will fall primarily on the universities, as will also the provisionof centres of research on which the further advancement of knowledge depends.In the past their most distinguished graduates have too often found scope fortheir talents only outside Scotland. If the future prosperity of Scotland is to be assured more of them w:ll require to be given opportunity to develop theirtalents within the country. The demand for places in the Scottish universitiesby 1970/71 was put by the Robbins Committee at about 36,000 as comparedwith some 22,000 in 1964/65. In the face of this growth the four long establisheduniversities of St. Andrews, Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow are expandingand are being supplemented by Strathclyde (1964), Heriot-Watt (1965),Dundee (1967) and Stirling (1967).267. A very specific contribution will come from the technological universities and from the technological faculties in the older universities. The contribution

which all universities make in the education of the most able young men andwomen and in pure research, is no less important and in the long run funda-mental to the future prosperity of Scotland.268. The central institutions will share with the universities the brunt of thetask of supplying the professionally qualified men and women needed and willbe increasingly concerned with higher level courses of the highest quality andrelevance to industry and commerce. They will be encouraged to develop to an increasing extent fuil-time and sandwich courses, including those leading to thedegrees of the Council for National Academic Awards, and post-experiencecourses tailored to meet particular needs.269. The network of further education colleges administered by the educationauthorities is being extended to provide more courses of all types for technicians,craftsmen and operatives and for the analogous levels in commerce. This will include the provision of the complementary educational facilities for theschemes of industrial training which arc now being developed by the industrial training Boards. Where appropriate, these colleges will be encouraged todevelop courses of a more advanced character.270. All this demands constant and close co-operation between education and industry at both national and local levels; this the Government intend to foster. Already most colleges have advisory committees including representativesof local industry and commerce. A number of authorities are setting up boards of management with representation from both sides of industry, for the largercolleges and it is essential that the others do so also. The Industrial LiaisonService attached to the central institutions in Aberdeen, Dundee and Paisley(in addition to Strathclyde and the Heriot-Watt Universities) has proved highly successful in bringing to the attention of industry the resources available at the institutions for research. The possibility of appointing liaison staff to some ofthe larger education authority colleges with the rather different function of informing industry (as well as the community at large) about the facilities forfurther education and training, is being explored. While the Government will use these and other means, such as the Scottish Technical Education Consulta-tive Council, the Scottish Council for Commercial Education and the ScottishAssociation for National Certificates and Diplomas, to secure that the cduca-tional contribution is relevant to the needs of industry and commerce, successwiil be achieved only if industry and commerce play their part in making their needs known. Firms must themselves take steps to achieve this through co-operation with the colleges; co-operation through representative bodies atnational level is not enough. Employers should make full use of the facilities offered, by releasing their young people to attend college courses.280. A substantial increase is planned in the places provided at further education colleges and, in the day-release field, this will cater for a studentpopulation of about 100,000 by 1970. The demand for places cannot be accur-ately assessed since it depends upon the willingness of individuals to pursue their studies beyond the statutory minimum period and the extent to which employers actively support the use of the opportunities available. development will also be related to the rate of progress achieved by Industrial TrainingBoards in encouraging employers to introduce training programmes which canbe approved for grant purposes, with a consequent demand for the associatedfurther education. The Boards&apos; grant schemes will normally stipulate that

payment to employers of training grant in respect of young trainees in cccupa-tions requiring a substantial amount of training is conditional upon attendance of the trainees at day release classes (or equivalent). The further education service will collaborate with the Boards and with industry and commerce to beready to meet the new needs as the Boards develop their training schemes.Education and investment281. To achieve these aims calls for a major investment in terms of human,financial and material resources. Between 1965 and 1970 the number of pupilsin education authority schools is expected to rise by about 60,000 and studentsin further education colleges and centres by about 64,000. Of the estimatedstudent increase, nearly 6,000 are full-time, 50,000 day-release (thus aboutdoubling the present figure) and 8,000 other part-time (mainly evening). In thesame period the number of students in colleges of education training to becometeachers will rise by nearly 3,000 to over 11,700.282. The supply of teachers should improve considerably over the period to1970 but the raising of the school leaving age in 1970/71, the growth in theschool population, the continuing need to reduce class sizes, and the provisionof new courses will all mean substantial additional demands for teachers.283. Capital expenditure will rise from  24m. in 1965/66 to  34m. in 1969/70.The school building programme will rise from  18m. in 1965/66 to  25m. in1969/70, an increase of 39 per cent. Capital investment on further educationcolleges and colleges of education will rise from  6m. to  9m., an increase of50 per cent. The allocation for schools will be sufficient to ensure the provisionof places for the rising number of pupils, including those moving to areas ofnew development, and for the additional secondary pupils when the school leaving age is raised. In further education, apart from providing more places in existing colleges, the programme will enable many more new colleges to be built, including a new commercial college in Dundee, new commercial andtechnical colleges in Edinburgh, and colleges of commerce, technology, naviga-tion and food technology in Glasgow, in addition to new colleges in Greenock,Kilmarnock, Hamilton, Motherwell and in Fife and the Lothians. At the sametime modern facilities and increased capacity for teacher training are being provided by a major expansion programme now in hand. Two new collegeshave come into operation in the last 18 months, one more is now being builtand a fourth will be built before 1970. Three existing colleges are being replacedand the remaining four will be modernised or extended. This programme will entail starting further projects to cost over  6m. It will include improvedtraining facilties for teachers already in service and will also more than double the residential accommodation for students at colleges of education.284. Capital investment of this order imposes considerable responsibilityupon both Government and education authorities to promote and encourage the use of modern planning techniques and building methods within theScottish construction industry. As substantial and powerful clients, they can usepublic purchasing power as a stimulus to technological advance within theindustry. At the same time the expansion of educational facilities of all kindsat the rate required will in itself demand more intensive planning and pro-gramming of projects, if they are to be completed in time. The Government will therefore encourage authorities to pursue further possibilities of standardising

components and adopting a more uniform approach to schedules of accommo-dation and design; of making greater use of industrialised building techniques;and of so adapting their contracting procedures as to make the maximum use of efficient building methods. In its turn, the Government is simplifying its ownmethods of approving projects. In association with the National BuildingAgency, it is developing co-ordinated building programmes for additionalschool accommodation to meet the raising of the school-leaving age in 1970,and for school hostels in the Highlands. It is also sponsoring research to developnew techniques for forecasting the school needs resulting from movements of population into large housing developments and new towns, in order to assistauthorities to co-ordinate school building with these. The aim must be toprovide schools and colleges where and when they are needed in buildings which can be intensively used, and to provide them by the use of moderntechniques so as to give the best value for money from the resources devoted to capital expenditure on education.

Chapter XIIICOMMUNICATIONS(1) Roads285. The Scottish Road Programme announced in 1964 envisaged Exchequerspending of some  120m. over the five years 1965-70 made up of about  70m.on the new construction and major improvement of trunk roads and motorwaysand about  50m. for classified roads. The Government have now reviewed theirpublic expenditure generally in the context of the National Plan, and have approved road programme expenditure for Scotland of  137m. over the samefive years, made up of approximately  S2m. for trunk roads and motorwaysand  55m. for classified roads. The 14 per cent addition to the programmeallows for recent increases in road construction costs and for the extra cost tothe Exchequer of building the high level bridge over the Clyde at Erskine as atrunk road instead of a classified road project. Most of the schemes in theScottish Road Programme are in Development Districts and are not subject tothe deferment measures announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer inJuly, 1965.286. With the help of this new programme, Scotland can expect by 1970, tohave the main modern network virtually completed between the main industrial areas of the Central Belt of Scotland and the main connection to the motorwaysystem in England and Wales. Some 209 miles of dual carriageway and motor-way routes should be in use by 1970 and a further 80 miles by about 1972. TheErskine Bridge, on which it is hoped to start work in the spring of 1968, shouldbe completed in 1971. In the Highlands, priority is being given to the Invergarry/Kyle of Lochalsh trunk road which should be completed in 1971. At the sametime a number of important improvements will go ahead in other parts ofScotland.287. The M.6 motorway which will join the improved A.74 road north ofCarlisle will provide Scotland with an important link, of motorway standard,with the south. Work on the Carnforth-Pcnrith and Pcnrith bypass sectionsshould be under way by 1966-67 and the whole project will be completed bythe early 1970s.288. The classified road programme also will be oriented towards meetingthe needs of Scottish development. By 1970 it is expected that the classified roadnetwork in East Kilbride (including its planned expansion) and CumbernauldNew Towns will be nearing completion, and that work will be well under wayon the construction of roads to serve the next stage of development at Glcnrothesand on the construction of the internal road system in Livingston and its link with the main regional routes; good progress with the first half of the GlasgowInner Ring Road will have been made; the permanent approaches to the ClydeTunnel will be complete, as will the Tay Road Bridge and its approaches.289. Looking further ahead, the early 1970s will see the completion tomotorway or near motorway standards of the 300 miles of important industrialtrunk routes in Central Scotland and the emphasis of the road programme willmove to the reconstruction of roads in towns, especially in the Clydesideconurbation, where a beginning has now been made in Glasgow on a system of urban motorways. Concurrently the programme for the inter-urban routes willturn to the overloaded or sub-standard lengths of, for example, the main

approaches to the Highlands by A.82 (Balloch/Crianlarich) and A.9 (Perth/BlairAtholl/Inverness), the through routes to the North-East, South-West andBorder regions, and bypasses of focal points such as Perth. It is estimated thatsome 350 miles of all-purpose roads must be improved in this second phase ofwork on inter-urban roads; it will involve major improvement schemes, manyminor improvement schemes and a comprehensive programme of maintenance work.290. In the regions outside the Central Belt, greater recognition will ingeneral, be given to the influence of improved communications on economic growth and to the need in some areas for a concentration of purpose. This will mean in practice paying special attention to the combined effects of all means oftransport and to the interaction of the needs of different sectors, e.g. forestry,tourism and industry. This will require a great deal of detailed work and apossible re-assessment of the priorities as we enter the 1970s.(2) Road Transport Services291. Since a large proportion of the country&apos;s total traffic is carried overrelatively short distances, the bulk of goods traffic must continue to move byroad; in Scotland the availability of services provided by vehicle ferries operating on the Clyde and in the Western Isles further tends to orientate the associatedtransport system towards road haulage. Since 1959 there has been an increaseof 11-5 per cent in the number of vehicles of all types licensed to carry goods andin the period to 1970 demand for goods transport is likely to be such that even with the diversion of some long distance traffic to rail which the introduction ofliner trains should be expected to produce the volume of road haulage willcontinue to grow. The increase in this period, however, is likely to be somewhatslower than in recent years.292. With the increasing use of private cars, bus service transport has beendeclining and this trend must be expected to continue. Because of the growingtraffic congestion in the major urban areas of Scotland, however, it will benecessary to strike a realistic balance in these areas between the volume of public and private transport. These problems are being studied; in the Greater Glasgowarea for example, where free movement of traffic is of vital importance to thecountry&apos;s future growth, a comprehensive transportation survey covering some450 square miles, is being undertaken with the object of developing an optimumnetwork of all transport facilities.(3) Rail Services293. The emerging pattern of the Scottish railway system for the next fewyears is now becoming clear. There will remain at least three main rail routes between England and Central Scotland (the future of the fourth is not yetdecided); continuing cross-links in Central Scotland between Grecnock, Glasgow,Edinburgh, Stirling, Dundee and Perth including a network of suburbanservices in the Glasgow area; lines running out from the central area to thesouth-west and to the West Highlands and a route in the North-East betweenPerth, Dundee, Aberdeen and Inverness with, at least for the immediate future,extensions to Wick and Kyle.

294. Railway reshaping in Scotland has in fact involved not merely and inevitably a programme of closures (the bulk of which have now been decided)but a concentration of effort and investment on those tasks which the railways are best suited to perform. In the past six years British Railways have investedmore than  75m. in the Scottish region and for the period up to 1970 their future plans include the provision of liner train terminals at Glasgow, Edinburgh,Dundee and Aberdeen. All these four have been included in Stage 1 of the pro-ject which the Minister of Transport has already authorised. The first linertrain services have started to operate between London and Glasgow on an experimental basis. The date of introduction of services to an from the otherScottish terminals will depend upon the experience gained with the first routes and the date of availability of additional rolling stock.295. For freight sundries British Railway&apos;s aim is to improve their service by concentrating traffic on four main depots (at Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow andKilmarnock), eleven secondary depots and thirty-two auxiliary depots. Inaddition to these, there will of course be numerous full-load depots handling,for example, coal. Associated with these depots there will be greatly improvedroad collection and delivery services and this combination will provide forScottish customers a better freight service than they had previously when therailway track mileage was greater.296. Plans in course of consideration include the introduction of a more modern signalling system on the main routes in order to increase line capacitiesand improve efficiency. Modern methods are also being introduced for the main-tenance of the permanent way by means of mechanical equipment in replacement of the traditional permanent-way gangs. With the introduction of diesel tractionin place of steam, a large programme of reconstruction is in hand at selectedmotive power depots. The depots to be retained will provide modern and efficientfacilities for the maintenance and servicing of diesel units. Another aspect of the major reshaping which is going on is the improvement of communications; a start has been made with a new Telecommunications Centre in Glasgow whichwill rationalise these facilities over a wide area. Main passenger stations arealso being modernised and the recently rebuilt station at Kirkcaldy provides agood example of present day station design. Major reconstruction is taking place at Queen Street Station, Glasgow, to facilitate the handling of the increasedtraffic to be dealt with there. Similar work on the approaches to Glasgow CentralStation is also programmed for completion before the introduction of theelectrified services between that station and Gourock/Wemyss Bay.297. In October, 1964, approval was given for the electrification of 37 miles of route between Glasgow and Gourock/Wemyss Bay, at a cost of about 6Jm. This represents the second stage in providing Glasgow with an up to datesuburban rail transport system (the Blue Trains), the first stage of which,involving mainly the electrification of lines to the north of the Clyde was completed in 1961. This scheme will be completed in the Spring of 1967. It isthrough modernisation measures of this kind, which will enable freight and passengers to be transported more quickly and efficiently, that the railways willmake their contribution to Scotland&apos;s economic growth.298. Further major rail developments in the Clyde Valley conurbation must clearly await the outcome of the Greater Glasgow Transportation Survey whichis expected to be completed by mid 1967. Meanwhile the British Railways

Board have agreed not to dispose of track formation, even after closure of a line to traffic, without the consent of the Minister of Transport.299. The new arrangements under which all passenger closure proposals are referred to the Scottish Economic Planning Council for their advice before a ministerial decision is taken, and the participation of the Ministry of Transport,along with a Railways Board representative, in all the work of the ScottishEconomic Planning Board, will ensure for the future that railway planning andthe wider issues of economic planning for Scotland march hand in band; that full account is taken of economic planning considerations: and that everyreasonable opportunity of linking railway operations to industrial or population growth prospects is taken into account.(4) Shipping Services and Ports300. Scotland has natural advantages for shipping. In particular the estuariesof the Clyde and the Forth cut deeply into the central industrial belt and provide for the manufacturer and exporter the shortest distance of any area inthe country between Atlantic and North Sea ports.301. From the information available, it has been estimated that over two-thirds of Scotland&apos;s exports find their way through Scottish ports. Some long-term trends have however weighed against an increase of traffic through these ports; the heavy industries no longer provide the same volume of bulk cargoesas formerly supported Scottish ports both as direct exit points and as first ports of call; and the economy has grown more quickly further south.302. Nevertheless, shipping through Scottish ports still provides a highly developed network of services to most ports of the world and there is a consider-able coastal trade. Faster growth in the Scottish economy and its furtherdiversification, including newer industries with a high proportion of exports,carries with it the means and opportunities to sustain the incoming and outgoingshipping services. To some extent this has already been happening for example,the oil and chemical traffic through Grangemouth and the motor vehicle andtractor exports flowing from the large new plants at Lin wood and Bathgate.303. Different considerations apply in the case of the services taking bothpassengers and cargo to and from the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland. these services are essential to the economy of the islands and in some cases receiveExchequer assistance. While some of their former passenger traffic may be lostas air services develop further, this is likely to be offset by increasing demand forsea travel arising from the development of tourism. Both private ears and com-mercial vehicles have made considerable use of the new vehicle ferries to Mull,Skye and the Outer Hebrides, and proposals for the introduction of vehicleferries to serve other islands are being considered by the Highland transport board.304. Increased economic growth will, as has been seen, mean increased traffic and, although the increase in foreign trade generated by increased industrial production and general economic activity will not necessarily all How throughScottish ports, the National Ports Council in their interim Report took the viewthat improved facilities should be provided to enable it to do so if traders wished.After the more rapid economic growth had been under way for a period of time,it would be easier to assess the degree of success being enjoyed by Scottish ports

in introducing the trade. Modernisation of the main Scottish ports is essential for the continued activity of shipping services and important schemes of develop-ment for the major Clyde and Forth ports were recommended by the PortsCouncil.305. At Leith, work has already started on the new entrance lock costing about  6m. which will turn the harbour into a &quot;deep water1 port of particularbenefit to the grain and fertiliser trade. When completed in 1968, the number ofberths of up to 30 feet draught will be increased from 8 to 21. and there will be13 berths of over 30 feet draught including 8 ocean ship berths.306. At Grangemouth the British Transport Dock Board\s proposal for anew enlarged entrance lock, at a cost of about  7m., has recently been approvedby the Minister of Transport and work is expected to start in 1966 and to becompleted in 1969. The improved facilities will be of great benefit not onlyto the expanding refinery and chemical complex there, but will also provide facilities for larger vessels in the bulk and general cargo trades.307. On the Clyde the new unified Clyde port authority will have a number ofimportant questions of policy to consider some of which will largely determine the future pattern of traffic-handling on the river. In the view of the national ports Council the long-term needs of the major Port of Glasgow could best bemet by a rationalisation of the existing facilities and the concentration of traffic on a smaller number of improved and modernised berths. Meanwhile the ClydeNavigation Trust are extending their Meadowside Granary at a cost of  1.1m.which will increase storage capacity by nearly 90 per cent and are improvingPrinces Dock at a cost of about  lm. The Clyde holds a big place in the develop-ment of the Scottish Economy, and the Government hope that the new authority will give the earliest possible consideration to the proposals discussed in the interim plan, including the merits of the deepening of the river over its wholelength and in the context of the Clyde as a whole of developing new deepwater berth facilities at Greenock.308. Overall, the National Ports CounciTs recommendation for the invest-ment of between  21m. and  24m. in the Scottish Ports on the Forth and Clydewill do much to bring Scottish ports facilities in this area up to modern standards,and it will be an important objective to see that these schemes are brought forward as urgently as possible. While the Interim Plan was not concerned withthe secondary ports, the Government recognise the continuing importance ofother Scottish ports, especially Dundee and Aberdeen, in the economics of the localities in which they are situated.(5) Airports and Air ServicesAir Transport309. Convenient facilities for air travel and air freight are clearly a greatasset for economic growth. Scotland has a number of well-sited airports, but hasa greater need of good air communications. It is therefore of special importanceto maintain a high up-to-date standard in aviation ground services, to remedyas soon as possible any material deficiencies and to work towards the provisionof the optimum economic air services. The provision of British air services is thecommercial responsibility of any interested operators who may apply for licences to the Air Transport Licensing Board, which is advised by the ScottishAdvisory Committee for Civil Aviation.

310. There has been a steady increase in the use of air services for bothinternal and international journeys and in the capacity and volume of trafficcarried by Scottish air services generally. On scheduled services, within, and toand from Scotland, a total of 1,415,847 passengers were carried by Britishairlines in 1964 an increase of 13 per cent over the previous year. In addition,69.297 passengers were picked up and set down at Prestwick by B.O.A.C.311. Air freight is also of increasing importance to Scottish air services; thetonnage handled has increased almost six-fold over the last ten years. about two-thirds of this traffic is handled at Prestwick and Renfrew.312. Scottish aerodrome and navigational facilities continue to be improved and as the following table shows, the level of public investment in these services is increasing. Af.1962/63 .      .      .      0-641963/64 .       .       .      1-81964 65 ...      201965/66 .       .       .      2-41966/67 .       .       .      2-6A irports313. At Prestwick Airport the new terminal building with its associatedfreight and maintenance facilities has been in use since September 1964. Therehas been a substantial rise in both passenger and freight traffic at the airport. Thetotal of passengers handled there in 1965 368,302-was 8 per cent up on theprevious year and there was a 15 per cent rise to 225,699 in the total of terminalpassengers. The upward trend was maintained during the first six months of1965, with an 11 per cent increase to 145,766 in the total of passengers and a19 per cent increase to 84,338 in the total of terminal passengers. The total of freight handled in the same period, 3,312 short tons.* was 64 per cent more thanin January-June 1964.314. The airport (modernised in recent years at a cost of  4 million) is to betaken over by the British Airports Authority in April, 1966, with the Ministry of aviation continuing to provide the navigation services.315. The development of Abbotsinch at a cost of  4-3m. as the future airportfor the Clyde Valley is nearing completion. The work on the runways, apron,control tower, radio aids and new terminal building is expected to be finishedand the airport in operation under Glasgow Corporation^ management by May1966. The Government will thereafter continue to provide the navigationservices. The demand for freight accommodation has exceeded expectations andaugurs well for the future.316. In east central Scotland, already an area of expansion for both industryand population, the part to be played by turn house airport is clearly of greatimportance. Discussions are continuing between the Ministry of Aviation and edinburgh Corporation about the possibility of the airport being taken over bythe Corporation, and about its further development to meet the needs of theEast of Scotland in the future.317. Internal Scottish Services are at present operated by B.E.A. partly withViscounts and partly with Heralds lent by the Government. B.E.A. wish to operate all Viscount services within Scotland (except to Tiree and Barra where* 2,000 lbs.

Herons will be retained) but in order to permit Viscounts to operate throughoutScotland with a reasonable payload, improved runways at three airports(Kirkwall, Sumburgh and Port Ellen) will be required. Since all Viscountoperations would provide a large carrying capacity and open the way to betterservices the Government have agreed to spend about  lm. on improving theseairfields.318. This proportionately heavy expenditure on aerodromes throughoutScotland means that up to 1970 and probably for some time thereafter thereshould be ample capacity to absorb the foreseen growth of air traffic. Scottishaerodromes are still under-utilised in varying degrees so adequate growthpotential exists, on the ground at any rate. As an example of new traffic it ishoped to encourage inclusive tours through Dalcross to serve the future touristneeds of the Cairngorms area.319. At Dundee, the Corporation have shown great enterprise in establishing the Riverside airstrip. Realisation of their airm to have a full city airport dependsprimarily, however, on the operational and commercial possibilities of a regularair-service to or through Dundee. In the light of the construction of the TayRoad Bridge and of the future growth in Dundee&apos;s population and economyforeseen in this paper, the problem now requires further consideration, and theScottish Economic Planning Council will accordingly, in consultation with theairline operators and other interests concerned, shortly be exploring the scope for an air service in the new circumstances.320. Some authorities have displayed an encouraging interest in airstrips forexecutive-type aircraft as an attraction for future development. The New Townsof Cumbernauld and Glenrothes are notable examples. Similar steps are beingtaken to meet the special needs of the Highlands: an airstrip has recently beencompleted in Mull, and plans are being made for the construction of seven more in the Orkneys with a view to the introduction of a scheduled service by lightaircraft between Kirkwall and the North Isles. It is hoped to construct airstripsin other parts of the Highlands and Islands with the assistance of the royal engineers, and the Highland Transport Board are exploring the possibility ofnew Teeder&apos; services by light aircraft, particularly where there arc lengthysurface journeys.Air Services321. International services have been augmented by B.O.A.C.&apos;s increase in scottish Monarch&apos; flights between Prestwick and New York to a frequency often a week during the summer peak. B.O.A.C. have also operated daily (lightsbetween Prestwick and Canada and there has been a further daily frequency by air Canada.322. Internal air services are continuing to expand as the traffic increases.B.E.A. trunk services between Glasgow/Edinburgh and London have now been developed to a frequency of well over 100 Vanguard flights a week. Appealsconcerning the rights of independant operators to run additional trunk services are at present sub judice. The recently introduced direct Aberdeen/LondonViscount service has proved to be so popular that B.E.A. arc expected to doubleit during 1966. The daily Viscount service which B.E.A. have recently introducedbetween Edinburgh and Birmingham provides a good example of the way inwhich air links can be developed. In this case specially rebated landing fees

facilitated the introduction of the service. When the Viscount becomes standardfor the Scottish internal air routes there will be a significant increase in capacityavailable and the commercial results of these services may be expected ultimately to improve.323. The prospects are now improved for the development of direct services between Scotland and the continent which would be particularly attractive to industrial and export interests. Such services must be on a commercial basis butthe enterprise displayed by Glasgow Corporation in their approach to theproblem of operating Abbotsinch is an important, helpful factor. Severalairlines are currently seeking licences for services linking Glasgow with Holland,Belgium and Germany.(6) Telecommunications324. To be able to get in touch quickly with one&apos;s customers, one\s suppliersand one&apos;s staff is quite essential for modern industry and commerce. Ease oftelecommunications, like ease of physical movement, is therefore particularly important for Scotland owing to her geographical position.325. The Post Office is already at work on a modernisation plan in Scotland-The specific objectives of this plan were twofold: firstly, to instal sufficient plan1by March, 1966 to avoid telephone installations being delayed by shortage o&apos;plant and to abolish the waiting list, and secondly, to work towards the elimination &quot;tion of manual exchanges and the completion of Subscriber Trunk Dialling by1970. Despite a 70 per cent increase in demand in Scotland in 1964/65 over thetwo previous years (with a 100 per cent increase in the Glasgow area) the first objective has almost been achieved; the waiting list should be negligible by March,1966. If, however, demand for telephones continues to grow at present rates,there is a likelihood that temporary shortages of exchange equipment will lateroccur in some places. Manufacturers are urgently expanding their capacity andit is hoped that the difficulties will be overcome by the early 1970s. As regardsthe second objective, it is hoped to complete the conversion to automaticworking of the larger manual exchanges in Scotland by 1970. About 90 per cent of this work has already been completed, including the provision this year ofimportant exchanges at Alloa, Coatbridge, Hamilton and Rutherglcn; most ofthe remaining work is mainly in exchanges in the remote areas where mechanisa-tion is more difficult, but this is being overtaken as quickly as possible.326. To meet the growing needs of the telephone system the capacity of exist-ing plant and the long-term forecasts of future growth are kept under continuous review. It is estimated that capital expenditure for the service will have almostdoubled over the five years to 1967 and will continue to increase thereafter up to1970. The Director of the Post Office in Scotland and the five area Managerswill continue to plan in terms of years ahead in view of the lengthy periodrequired to produce and instal equipment. In collaboration with the Ministry ofPublic Building and Works they are constantly reviewing ways of reducing the planning and construction periods of exchange buildings.327. Subscriber Trunk Dialling in Scotland will be made available to mostsubscribers in Scotland by 1970. The exceptions should be only in very remoteplaces where special technical difficulties may lead to fulfilment only after thatdate. The Post Office plans include not only the provision of S.T.D. to those at

present without it, but also the extension, as new equipment becomes available,of the range of exchanges to which calls may be dialled direct by those who already have S.T.D. Data, facsimile and picture transmission services are already avail-able in Scotland. More sophisticated systems are being developed and these tooare expected to become available, at any rate in the larger cities.

Chapter XIVFUEL, POWER, AND WATER SUPPLY SERVICESFuel and Power Services328. The total energy consumption in Scotland, expressed in terms of coalequivalent, increased from 25-34 million tons in I960 to 26-62 million tonsin 1964, equal to 9-3 per cent of the total for the U.K. On the assumption thatthe Scottish economy will grow at a slightly higher rate than the rest of theU.K. over the period up to 1970, it is reasonable to assume that the Scottishshare of the total U.K. energy consumption will show a slight increase. TheMinistry of Power&apos;s latest view, as published in the National Plan, is that thedemand for energy in the U.K. will total 324 million tons of coal equivalent in1970. Thus the demand in Scotland may be 30-31 million tons. The development plans of the coal, electricity, gas and oil industries, which are described in the succeeding paragraphs, indicate that while the inter-relationship of these industries may continue to present some problems, Scotland can meet the totalforeseeable demand for energy.Coal329. Following the exhaustion of most of the shallower and richer reserves ofcoal in Scotland, the National Coal Board at vesting date in 1947 embarkedupon an extensive reconstruction programme to tap the deeper coal measures.But the geological conditions encountered at the greater depths turned out to be worse than had been expected and heavy financial losses were incurred. TheBoard have been striving to cut their losses in Scotland by introducing moderntechniques and equipment and by the gradual concentration of production on new and reconstructed collieries. At the same time they have been closing pitsthat were exhausted or had become grossly uneconomic, and 82 pits were closed in the six-year period from 1959 to 1964.330. Improved productivity has already been effected from 22-9 cwt. in 1961to 29-2 cwt. per man shift in 1964/65-and the current year will show a further increase. During the past two financial periods the Scottish Division have madea small operational profit. The computer-controlled Longannct project and thedevelopment of the major collieries of Bilston Glen, Killoch, Monktenhall andSeafield are examples of the application of modern continuous mining techniq ueswhich are replacing the conventional cycle of operations, and these should leadto still further increases in efficiency.331. The use of coal in Scotland has been falling in recent years from !8-3m&apos;tons in 1960 to 15-5m. tons in 1964. Total output of deep-mined coal in 1964/65was 15-5m. tons. Scotland is largely a self-contained market and the size of themining industry in 1970 will be determined by the effectiveness of its success in continuing to reduce costs. Over the period 1960-64 colliery manpower inScotland dropped from an average of 72-2 thousand to 51-7 thousand arundown of about 5,000 a year. Further closures and increases in workingefficiency will lead to continuing reductions in manpower requirements. Butthe industry will remain able to meet any likely level of demand in the Scottishmarket and the Board will wish to retain as many of the skilled miners affectedby closures as are willing to be re-deployed within the industry.

332. The White Papers on Fuel Policy* and the Finances of the Coal Industry!have set out the problems of the coal industry and have given details of theGovernments plans to help the industry to strengthen its position. The Govern-ment will help by providing special funds to assist the re-deployment andre-settlement of men affected by the closure of uneconomic collieries and willalso cancel part of the Board&apos;s capital debt.Gas333. Substantial progress has been made with the integration of gas productionand distribution in Scotland. Many small and uneconomic works have been closed and there are now only 46 in operation compared to 195 in 1949. Follow-ing completion in 1960 of the Lurgi high-pressure coal gasification plant inFife (the first of its kind in the United Kingdom) and its associated super grid,gas is now distributed at high pressure through two major grids supplyingCentral Scotland. Outside the Central Belt work is in progress to integrate theAberdeen-Inverness area and an integration scheme to serve the Dumfries area from Kirkcudbright to Langholm is scheduled to be completed in 1966. Thesetwo schemes, including new works and a high-pressure grid mains system tosupply surrounding undertakings, will ensure ample supplies to meet future requirements and should provide an additional attraction facility for industrycontemplating a move to these areas.334. The demand for gas in Scotland declined at a steady rate throughout the1950s but since then there has been a resurgence in demand and in the lastfinancial year total sales reached a record level of 218 million therms-an increaseof 8A per cent over the previous year. Demand is expected to reach 300 milliontherms by 1970. The increases in demand for gas have followed substantially increased sales of the modern and improved types of appliances, particularly inthe domestic field.335. In order to preserve its competitive position in relation to other fuels,the industry has taken advantage of the new oil-based processes which producecheaper and less toxic gas, and has progressively replaced coal by petroleum products as its raw material. The use of coal for gas-making has fallen from1-78 million tons in 1960 to 1-3 million tons in 1964, but it is still the largestindividual source of gas supplies. Coal usage will decline still further, however,as more oil-based plant comes into operation.336. The production of gas coke has been decreasing with the increasing useof oil as a basic raw material for gas manufacture. The total amount of cokemade for sale dropped from 573 thousand tons in 1960 to 324 in 1964. Afurther decline is expected, although the Board will continue to make the improved type of solid smokeless fuel, lGloco&apos;, to enable them to meet theirexisting commitments.Electricity337. Power stations&apos; fuel requirements are expected to grow at a lower rate than the demand for electricity due to the improvements in thermal efficiencyexpected at thermal power stations. Coal will meet the bulk of the increase in fuel demand, although compared with 1964 there is expected to be some addi-tional contribution from Hunterston Nuclear Power Station, which was not* Fuel Policy-Cmnd. 2798.t The Finances of theCoal Industry Cmnd. 2805.

fully commissioned for the whole of that year and additional oil demand atDundee with the commissioning of new oil-fired capacity there. The maximumdemand which had to be met by the Scottish Electricity Boards from the main-land system increased from 2,570 MW in 1960 to 3,700 MW in 1964, an average annual increase of 9-5 per cent. On the basis of the National Plan, the Boardsexpect that demand may reach over 6,000 MW&quot; in 1970 and generating stations are already under construction which will be sufficient to meet this increasing demand and to provide a margin for severe weather conditions, breakdowns andunforeseen circumstances. By this time, the South Board&apos;s 1.200 MW coal-fired station at Cockenzie. which will start operating in 1966 will be in fullcommission and the 2,400 MW coal-fired station at Longannet in Fife will alsobe partially in operation. The North Board&apos;s 400 MW pumped storage hydro-station at Cruachan started operating in 1965 and will be in full commission in1966.338. The Boards expect that consumption of electricity in Scotland will increase from 13,400 million units in 1964 to 22,500 million units in 1970 andthat some 70 per cent of the additional fuel requirements in this period will bemet by coal. The South Board will continue to be the National Coal Board&apos;slargest individual consumer of coal in Scotland. Transmission and distributionsystems in both Boards&apos; areas are being strengthened and extended, and thenecessary reinforcements to local distribution networks are proceeding to meetincreases in load and to provide increased security of supply to consumers.339. Rural distribution has been virtually completed in the South Board&apos;sarea. The North Board face considerable problems in supplying the remoterparts of their area, but notwithstanding the substantial revenue losses incurred,they plan to accelerate the rate of connection to enable all but 1,000 extremelyremote rural dwellings to be supplied by 1972; the capital cost of this operation is  6 million.340. The two Scottish Boards&apos; systems are continuously linked to permit a two-way exchange of supplies to meet demands which might not otherwise bemet by the individual Boards. Similarly, the Scottish system is linked, by way ofthe South Board&apos;s system to the transmission network in England. The 275 kVsupergrid in Scotland is for the most part capable of working at 400 kV and willbe linked to the English 400 kV system for bulk supply of electricity now being constructed by the C.E.G.B.Oil341. The use of oil in Scotland for all purposes increased from 3-15 million tons in 1960 to 4-95 million tons in 1964, and is expected to rise at a slightly lower annual rate of about Ih per cent up to 1970. The most significant increases have been in the industrial use of fuel oil and in feedstocks for petroleum-chemical plants; the latter reflecting the rapid growth of this industry in scotland in recent years. The annual capacity of the Grangemouth oil refinery has been increased to 4.1 million tons; the carrying capacity of the associated cross-country crude oil pipeline from the Finnart ocean terminal has been almostdoubled, and additional crude oil storage facilities installed. Part of the output from the Grangemouth refinery is exported to the Continent. There is also aflow of refined oil products from other refineries in England, for which increasedstorage facilities have been provided in Scotland by the companies concerned.

Sites suitable for further refinery developments exist together with deep waterberthing facilities.Future Developments342. At a time of rapid technological innovation, fuel policy must be suffiently flexible to enable economic benefit to be derived from new sources of energy as they become available. The exploration for oil and natural gasdeposits in the North Sea is being vigorously pursued and, as has been recently announced, it is possible that there may be a second nuclear power station inScotland in the period 1970-75, based on the Advanced Gas-Cooled Reactor.Water Supply Services343. The water resources of Scotland, once harnessed, are capable of meetingany foreseeable demand of a developing social, agricultural and industrialeconomy. But the increasing need for more water, both by new industries andindustrial processes, and by the intensive programme of housing development,presents its own challenge. Local authorities must increasingly look furtherafield for their supplies and must work together in doing so. A major advance inthis direction has been the co-operation of a group of authorities in central scotland who are seeking the necessary statutory powers to draw water fromLech Lomond to supply their growth areas, while steps are also being taken toform a number of regional all-purpose water boards large enough to financeother major works that may be needed. If the forecast rate of growth is to beachieved, the more fortunate authorities, with adequate supplies for their own needs, can no longer stand aside but must be prepared to play their part in creating the kind of organisation that will match the requirements for waterthat a modern Scotland will need.344. Vital in the immediate future is the harnessing of Loch Lomond andLoch Bradan which between them can supply some 70 million gallons a day atthe outset and are capable of being increased as the need arises to yield 130 m.g.d.Of other schemes the Glenfinglas Scheme of Glasgow Corporation was recentlycompleted to yield an additional 10 m.g.d. and five other major schemes under construction are due to yield some 34 m.g.d. by 1969. Moreover the plans of oneof them, that Dundee Corporation, made provision for subsequent stages asdemand is foreseen to yield another 33 m.g.d. Schemes are in preparation, but atthe pre-construction stage, capable of yielding some further 30 m.g.d.345. The Scottish Water Advisory Committee, who have already reported onthe water service in the central industrial area of Scotland, including Ayrshireand Renfrewshire, are at present engaged on an extension of their studies to therest of the country.

Chapter XVTHE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES346. The size of the contribution of the construction industry to the develop-ment of Scotland is perhaps not sufficiently recognised. With nearly 200,000workers and an annual output of over  350m. it is a major component of theScottish economy and its tasks are many and varied. It must build the factoriesfor the industrial resurgence; the roads and bridges, tunnels and docks, power stations and water installations of the essential infrastructure; the hospitals and schools for community needs; and the houses required for the four-fold task of improving housing standards, providing for the increasing population,sustaining economic growth and renewing the older areas. In addition theindustry must undertake repair and maintenance of existing houses, factories,roads and installations.347. The increased programme of investment in Scotland over the past fewyears has already led to a striking expansion in the construction industry.In absolute terms, and at constant prices, the output of the industry increasedbetween 1960 and 1964 by 24 per cent, an average of 5-6 per cent (compound)per annum. This was achieved despite the severe disruption to work caused bythe cold weather in the winter of 1962/63. The continuing programme of expansion will require not only the maintenance of the present high rate of activity in the construction industry, but considerable further growth.348. Construction firms can be divided into two groups. First, there arc themain contractors, including general builders, building and civil engineeringcontractors, and civil engineering firms. These firms undertake main contracts and when necessary employ specialist firms in the second group such asplumbers, joiners and carpenters, painters, plasterers and glaziers as specialistsub-contractors.349. As the expansion of the construction industry has proceeded in scotland the total number of firms has declined, but the number of large firms has been growing between 1958 and 1964 the number of firms with 250 workers ormore went up from 48 to 67. Another development is the establishment, by several national contractors, of organisations or branches north of the Border.There have of course been some similar movements on the part of expandingScottish construction firms who have established themselves in England.Output in 1964 and assumed demand in 1970- Scotland *Housing1964(Output)  million1091970(Demand)1964 prices155Other New Work:For public authorities for private developersTotal other new work926615815590245Total new work267400Repair and maintenance8495Grand Total351495* Including work by public authorities&apos; own employees.

350. Total demand by 1970 is estimated, at 1964 prices, to rise to  495m.,an increase of 41 per cent over the value of work done in 1964, an average annual increase of 5-8 per cent (compound) (cf. Chapter II, Table A).351. The most important element in this increased programme is housing onwhich expenditure by 1970 is expected to be about  155m.. requiring an in-crease in output of nearly 42 per cent by comparison with 1964. As output in1965 is not likely to show much improvement over 1964 most of this consider-able increase will have to come in the later years.352. In the &quot;other new work&apos; sector it is expected that by 1970 demand will reach  245m., requiring an increase in output of 55 per cent. An important element in this sector is the roads programme, described in Chapter X (i). inwhich demand is likely to rise between 1964 and 1970, by over 70 per cent.As this type of work readily lends itself to mechanisation it is thought that this very substantial increase in output should be attainable, without adverse effecton the housing programme.353. In the repairs and maintenance sector a modest increase in demand ofabout 2 per cent per annum is expected. It is hoped, however, that the industry will be able to achieve an increase of productiv ity greater than this, thus releasingvaluable resources, particularly of skilled manpower, to help in the greatlyexpanding new work sectors. Guidance in this respect will be available from acommittee recently set up by the Minister of Public Building and Works, inco-operation with the industry, to investigate problems in this field.354. The capacity of the industry to meet these likely demands upon it depends upon its being able to obtain adequate supplies of materials, to expandits labour force, and to achieve a satisfactory increase in productivity, in termsof output per man year.355. In the recent past, the supply of certain building materials, in particularbricks, cement, plaster-board, and copper fittings has not always matcheddemand. Studies by the Department of Economics, Queeifs College, Dundee,of the major construction materials have therefore been commissioned by theScottish Economic Planning Council. These will enable any likely shortagesto be foreseen and action can then be taken to meet them. The Council will consider repeating these studies at appropriate intervals. Maintenance of a steady and planned work load on the industry will facilitate the organisation ofsupplies of materials and the investment planning of materials producers. Itshould also help in planning ahead that the size of the programme of public sector construction, which accounts for about three-fifths of all constructionwork, is now being indicated for 1969/70.356. Because of the importance of the construction industry in the planning of Scotland&apos;s economic development, the Scottish Economic Planning Councilalso commissioned last year a study by Queen&apos;s College, Dundee, of the prob-able load on the industry up to 1970, and its capacity to meet it. The Ministryof Labour also arranged for the carrying out at Glasgow University of a detailedappraisal of the manpower situation in the industry in Scotland. The results ofthese two investigations are now being studied.357. First appraisal of these studies confirms that in order to attain theestimated annual output of  495m. in 1970 (at 1964 prices) it will be necessaryto secure substantial increases both in the labour force of the Scottish con-struction industry and in the productivity of workers in the industry.

358. The Scottish construction industry increased its overall manpower atan average rate of 1-8 per cent per annum (compound) in the period I960 to1964. The best estimates that can be made suggest that over the period 1964 to1970, a growth of about 1-6 per cent per annum compound in Scottish con-struction manpower can reasonably be expected. This includes an increase ofabout 1 -4 per cent in the operative labour force and an increase of about thesame magnitude in the number of craftsmen. The increase in the number ofcraftsmen is a vital component, and is expected to be obtained from a numberof sources transfers of skilled workers from other industries, an excess ofintake from apprenticeships over retirements and other losses, the output from government Training Centres, and an increase in craftsmen available from areduction in total net migration.359. There is obviously a considerable possible margin of error in these estimates of the increased labour supply likely to be available. Over the last few years the industry appears to have been able to recruit additional labourwithout much difficulty, principally because of the relative weakness of thegeneral demand for labour and the contraction of several important industries.In the period which lies ahead it may not have these advantages to the same degree and it is difficult to predict how large transfers from other industriesmay be. The Government will continue to examine as a matter of urgencymethods by which the growth in the construction industry labour force, andparticularly in the supply of skilled labour, can be fostered. The training ofjoiners, bricklayers and other construction craftsmen at Government TrainingCentres has been increasing since the first courses began in September, 1963,and the Government will ensure that the fullest possible scope is given to this programme.360. The Construction Industry Training Board, which is representative ofboth employers and employees, will continue to examine ways of improvingtraining in all sections of the industry. In addition, the Scottish Committeeof the Central Training Council is considering the intake of apprentices to theconstruction industry which will be necessary to supply skilled workers for itsanticipated growth.361. In Scotland the period of apprenticeship has been five years, but bothsides of the industry have recently agreed to the reduction of this period by oneyear. When this agreement has been fully implemented, it will result in a once for all increase of about 3,500 in the number of time-served tradesmen, and thefact that full craftsman^ wages can be earned at the age of 20 may have astimulating effect on apprentice recruitment. Other possibilities of improving the apprenticeship system will also be examined.362. The need for strengthening the professional, technical, managerial, andsupervisory resources is widely acknowledged within the industry, and the dangers attendant upon any failure to do so are evident. It will be necessary toconsider the ways in which the necessary staffs can be recruited, trained anddeployed to the best advantage.363. But even if the 1-6 per cent per annum increase in Scottish constructionmanpower is obtained achievement of the higher output needed is bound to depend to a large degree on the achievement of greater productivity. Over theperiod from 1960 to 1964 the increase in output per man year in the industryin Scotland was about 3-8 per cent per annum compound. Given the expectation

of steady and continued growth, it should be possible for the industry to achieve a further significant increase in productivity.364. The compound rate of increase in output per man year in Scotlandestimated for the period 1964 to 1970 is 4-1 per cent per annum. To achieve this, it will be necessary to devote great attention to the ways in which theefficiency and productivity of the industry can be improved.365. Increased mechanisation can make a considerable contribution, as can the wider use of programming techniques to improve the use of machinery.Standardisation of materials, and dimensions, is also important; on the sitethis would increase productivity by reducing the number of different tasks oroperations, make it easier to operate bonus and incentive schemes, and help to ease the problem of supervision. More use must be made of measures to combat the effects of bad weather and the loss of daylight in winter. Designerstoo can contribute by bearing in mind the problems that will arise in convertingtheir designs into construction and striving always to combine a high quality of design with simplicity of construction.366. While there wilt be no tack of demand for building by rationalised andmodernised traditional methods, it is essential that industrialised and systembuilding techniques be exploited to the full. Such techniques provide an oppor-tunity for using a greater proportion of non-craft labour and make possible themore productive utilisation of labour generally through the use of larger units,greater mechanisation, more efficient methods of erection and assembly and thereduction of time-consuming wet finishing processes. They can, moreover,augment the resources of the site labour force by the much greater use of off-siteprefabrication employing sophisticated production techniques and ensuringcontinuity of production to a consistent quality, regardless of the weather. Tomake the best use of industrialised building there must be better organisationof demand and arrangements for the placing of large orders. The NationalBuilding Agency can help client authorities to pool their demands and give advice on the best systems available to meet a particular clients needs.367. It has long been recognised that wide advertising for competitive tendersis wasteful of effort. One means of reducing this waste is to adopt selectivetendering (i.c., to limit invitations to tender to a realistic number of firms all ofwhom are capable of executing the work in question to a recognised standard ofcompetence), and it is hoped that more clients of the industry will adopt this method of inviting tenders. More use might also be made in appropriate casesof negotiated contracts, which allow the contractor to be consulted at an early stage in planning the project, and of serial contracting which facilitates the continuous employment of teams of workmen, accustomed to working together,on a series of repetitive or similar operations.368. Considerable benefit can be obtained from the improvement andstandardisation of forms and conditions of contract, and it is hoped that thenew conditions for building contracts in Scotland recently introduced by theScottish Building Contract Committee will be widely adopted. They arc basedon R.I.B.A. conditions currently in use in England with alterations to conform to Scots law and Scottish build ing practice.369. All the investigations which have been made for the Scottish economic planning Council show that, in the opinion of the industry, the greatest singlefactor making for higher productivity would be an assurance of a steadily

increasing demand over a period of years. The projections now made forScotland and those in the National Plan should help to this end, and it is theGovernments intention to carry out further reviews of the probable load onthe industry in Scotland against its likely capacity, so that it may have the best possible framework on which to plan ahead.

Chapter XVIINVESTMENT370. The measures described in earlier chapters of this White Paper will involve continuing capital investment on a massive scale. Much of this will beprovided by the Government, local authorities and the nationalisedundustries,but private investment will also have a large part to play.Public Investment371. As the National Plan has pointed out, planning of public investmentfour or five years ahead must be flexible so that unexpected changes in popula-tion, costs, or technological development can be taken into account; in addition the capital investment programmes of some Government departments, andsome of the nationalised industries, are drawn up on a Great Britain or UnitedKingdom basis and cannot with precision be allocated in advance to different parts of the country. Subject to these limitations, the public capital investment programme for Scotland has been examined for the period up to 1969/70,using in some cases information later than that available for the National Plan.372. Public investment in Scciland* is expected to amount in the current year to  363 million, compared to  303 million in 1964/65. Housing, electricity,and roads are the major items. The 1965/66 expenditure is as follows:Estimated Public Investment in Scotland 1965/66*Other Nationalised Industries .of which National Coal BoardScottish Gas BoardS. of S. Electricity HoardN. of S.

In the period covered by this White Paper the Government intends thatthe modernisation of the Scottish economy shall be pressed forward with allpossible speed. To this end, it is planning a public investment programmeexpected to amount to almost  2,000 million over the five years. The present rate of investment is approximately 11 per cent of the total U.K. public invest-ment, compared with Scotland&apos;s 9\ per cent share of U.K. population in 1964;over the five year period total public investment will be about  375 per head ofthe population, or about  75 per head annually. The biggest single factor inthe higher percentage of public investment in Scotland is the higher proportionof housing provided by public authorities.374. The details of this sustained and substantial public investment elfortwill be kept under review from year to year to ensure that, within the limits set by the progress of the national economy as a whole, the programmes in each* This excludes defence and comprises expenditure on fixed assets, less sales, together withrants and net lending to the private sector.

sector are adequate to meet the needs of the expanding Scottish economy. As atpresent planned, the programme envisages the following expenditures (at 1965prices).Anticipated Public Investment in Scotland 1965 66 to 1969/70  million at 1965 pricesHousing (incl. improvement grants) .	.     535Roads.......	180Education (excl.

For housing a steady build-up is envisaged as the programme described in Chapter XI is translated into 50,000 houses a year, the majority of themprovided by public authorities. The cost of houses provided by public authorities will rise from  95 million in the current year to  115 million in 1969/70. Theroads programme outlined in Chapter XIII (but including also car parks,lighting, and unclassified roads, will involve a progressive increase in the annual rate of expenditure to  42 million in 1969/70. The programme of new building in education involves for schools and colleges expenditure of  34 million in1969/70, compared with  24 million now, and the investment involved in theprogramme for the universities is additional to this.376. Transport investment will reach a peak in the middle of the period, but with the completion of some of the schemes of railway modernisation andairport construction and improvement may be slightly lower in 1969/70.Investment in the nationalised electricity undertakings is expected to be at a rateof over  60 million per annum in 1969/70. Investment in improved and expandedhospitals, health, and welfare services is planned to rise from  11 million thisyear to  14 million, and investment by the Post Office, mainly in the tele-communications services, is expected to grow steadily throughout the period.Private Investment377. As the National Plan has pointed out, private investment is much moredifficult to forecast than is public investment. Indeed, it cannot be fully quantifiedfor Scotland. There is every reason, however, to anticipate that with the con-continuation and strengthening of the Governments regional policies the verylarge injection of public investment in Scotland will be complemented by a growing volume of private investment.378. The National Plan has suggested that in the period 1965 to 1969,investment in manufacturing industry will have to average 25 per cent abovethe 1964 level. Over the last five years this type of capital expenditure hasaveraged over  100 million a year in Scotland, including the contribution from government loans and grants. The Governments intensified regional develop-ment policy and continued steering of industrial building away from the congested areas of the country will encourage the continued expansion ofprivate investment in manufacturing industry in Scotland.379. An increasing rate of private investment will also be required in distribu-tion and other services, for such things as the redevelopment of town centres by

private developers, and modernisation and expansion of wholsesale and retail distribution, hotels, catering, offices, and road haulage. An indication of thepossible increase (in the building portion only) of investment in manufacturing,distribution and other services can be obtained from Chapter XV where new building work for private developers, excluding housing, is forecast to rise by36 per cent between 1964 and 1970.380. The Government has said in the recent White Paper on The ScottishHousing Programme that it intends that more houses should be built for sale.This, too, will lead to a rising curve of private investment, as will the increasein productivity called for from agriculture.381. Although it is not possible to make detailed forecasts of private capital investment in Scotland, all these factors point to a rising trend in private investment which will be helped by, and will itself reinforce, the efforts beingmade in the public sector.PRINTERS NOTEThis completes Chapter XVI and is followedby Appendix A commencing on page 140.Pagination will be correct in finished copies.

APPENDIX ATHE REGIONAL STUDIESIntroductionThis appendix contains synopses of studies, undertaken by the Scottish economic planning Board, of the Borders, the South-West, the North-East and the highlands and Islands.The aim of these studies was to identify the main problems of each area and those elements in the economy of each which offer scope for development. The studies were also designed to help define patterns of concentration, which would help to stabilisepopulation structure and create new forces for growth which could be related to the developing pattern of the economy of Scotland and the U.K.It was therefore not the object of the studies to make an exhaustively detailedappraisal of all aspects of the areas examined, but rather to concentrate on certaintrends, especially in demography and employment.Local authorities were informed of the studies at the outset. Many made valuablesubmissions. Subsequently consultations and discussions were held with local authori-ties and other bodies throughout Scotland. Of particular importance was theco-opera-tion received from the Hosiery and Woollen Manufacturers&apos; Associations and, through them, of many individual manufacturers, in the examination of the Border textile industry. Special studies were commissioned of a selection of crofting communities and carried out by Glasgow and Aberdeen Universities.The conclusions reached in the studies, and the broad strategy for action now pro-posed by the Government, are set out in Chapters IX and X of this White Paper. Towork out the details of this strategy and implement the proposals will call for the close co-operation of local authorities in the areas concerned. There will be the fullest localconsultation. It is hoped that the analyses set out in the following pages may serve a useful background all concerned with the work of practical implementation of the policies set out in the White Paper.

The BordersPart 1THE STUDY AREA1. The area covered by the study is the economic region of the Tweed basin, withLiddesdale and Eskdale that is to say, the counties of Berwickshire, Roxburghshire.Selkirkshire and Peeblesshire, with the Langholm district of Dumfriesshire in Scotland;and the northern part of Northumberland lying within the lower Tweed valley. this region lies across four road and two main rail routes from east Central Scotland to theNorth of England and its centre, the St. Boswells area, is 40 miles from Edinburgh,60 from Carlisle, 65 from Newcastle and 75 from Glasgow. Altogether it extends forsome 60 miles by 40 and comprises in the north-east the arable farming lowland of theMerse and the Bervvick-Eyemouth coast; in the middle Tweed zone the woollen andknitwear towns in their dales; and enfolding both of these the sheep farming uplandsof Cheviot, Liddesdale, Ettrick, Moorfoot and Lammermuir and the higher forestryland bordering the upper Tweed.2. The predominantly rural economy of the east, based on agriculture and served by small country towns, and the predominantly urban, industrial economy of the West,characterise two distinct sub-regions. Heavy depopulation the main theme of the study is common to both, but in each it has very different implications.3. The administrative areas are:1964 Population13,55020,55034,9504,75073,8008,00022,05022,60052,650126,450These areas are nearly the same as those of the Ministry of Labour Local Ollices ofPeebles, Galashiels, Hawick (including Jedburgh Sub-Office) in the west; and KelsoSub-Office, Eycmouth and Berwick-upon-Tweed in the cast. The Galashiels local office includes a part of south Midlothian around Stow which is also within the TweedBasin. Kelso, though in Roxburgh, which as a county belongs to the western complex,is perhaps more properly regarded with its Sub-Office area as part of the agriculturaleconomy of the Merse.4. About 100,000, or nearly four fifths, of the population inhabit the broad con-tinuously settled valley of the lower and middle Tweed. Only the remaining 26,000are dispersed in the less accessible upper dales and outlying towns. More than half thetotal population is in fact urban, (78 per cent in the Western Area, 42 per cent in thePeebles County .Selkirk County  .........Roxburgh County (excluding Kclso Burgh and District) .Langholm Burgh and District in Dumfries County .Sub-Total, Western Area       .      .      .      .      .Kelso Burgh and District    .......Berwick County .........Berwick-upon-Tweed Municipal Borough;Norham and Islandshires, and Glendale Rural Districts inNorthumberland      .......Sub-Total, Eastern Area        .       .      .      .      .Total .........

Eastern), but it is distributed in 14 separate burghs (72,000 or 56 per cent) and 7 largevillages (7,500 or 6 per cent). Even the largest towns of Hawick (16,200), Galashiels(12,300) and Berwick-upon-Tweed (12,100) are district rather than regional centres and the lack of any one major urban focus, comparable to Dumfries, Perth or Inverness,gives a local separateness and rivalry to Border towns which now constitutes one ofthe region&apos;s serious handicaps. The group of towns and villages in the middle zonewithin about 15 miles of Galashiels has an aggregate population of 73,000, a point which assumes some importance later.5. Roads, both within the area and linking it to Edinburgh and the south, are relativelynumerous. There are no less than four through-routes in the Borders: A7 to Carlisle,A68, A697 and AI to Newcastle. Given the necessity of concentrating a great deal of investment on M6 A74, the main traffic route between England and Scotland, whichbypasses the Borders to the west, none of these four has been able to claim sufficientlyheavy use to justify major improvement. Again, the internal distribution routes (inpart certain lengths of the through routes) are insufficiently trafficked to justify theexpensive improvement of numerous stretches of bad alignment which would enhancethe value of relatively short inter-urban distances for both public and private transport.6. Two main railway lines pass through the area, the east coast route from Edinburghto Newcastle and London, via Berwick-upon-Tweed; and the &quot;Waverley&apos; route fromEdinburgh to Carlisle, the Midlands and London via Galashiels, St. Boswells andHawick. In the Eastern Area the value of local railway services to a sparse and highlymobile agricultural population has declined and there is now only one main passenger station, at Berwick itself. The St. Boswells Berwick-upon-Tweed line has been closedto all traffic on condition that the track is left meantime. In the Western Area the short freight spurs to Jedburgh and Selkirk have recently been closed. The &quot;Waverley&apos;route, a costly line to operate, was scheduled for closure in British RaiPs &quot;Reshaping&apos;report. This trunk line is of local importance for both passenger and industrial use and carries considerable through freight traffic. It also offers a sleeper service toLondon for the principal Border towns.7. Changes in educational provision reflect the character of the area in a similar way.Thirty-two rural primary schools have been closed in recent years which has meantlonger journeys to school for the scattered population. Secondary education can onlybe provided at the main towns, and the only full-time further education establishment in the Borders (including North Northumberland) is the Scottish Woollen TechnicalCollege at Galashiels. Any wider range of training can only be obtained by travellingout of the area-or leaving it.8. Though most of the Borders are in a sense isolated, by hills and winter weather,they are not really remote. Much of the area is only an hours run by train or ear fromEdinburgh and little more from Tyneside. Agriculture prospers and there is negligibleman-made dereliction in the well-kept countryside. The towns are well-kept and seemly,presenting little of the decay and obsolescence one finds in some North of Englandtextile towns or in Central Scotland. Environmentally it is one of the most attractiveparts of Britain but its appearance conceals a situation of unbalance and decline.Part IIPOPULATION9. Depopulation has caused concern in the Borders for many years and is a symptomof most of the region*s problems. Much of rural Scotland, and indeed many ruralparts of the western world generally, exhibit depopulation. It is on the one hand aproduct of increasing efficiency and falling manpower requirements in primaryindustries particularly agriculture; and of increasing urbanisation and industrialisa-

tion on the other. As the volume and variety of employment grows in the maincentres of population, so the range and number of jobs in the countryside and smallercountry towns declines; and with improved communications country dwellers them-selves look increasingly to the larger centres, which alone can supply the ever-wideningrange of cultural, entertainment and service requirements of modern life.10. The special characteristic of depopulation in the Borders is that besides thinningout population in the countryside and villages it has also, to an extent unparalleledelsewhere in the U.K., eroded the demographic stability of the main towns as well.Recent Changes11. The population of the four Scottish Border counties has been decreasing slowlysince 1891 in Berwick County since 1861-but the inter-Censal rate of decreasebetween 1951 and 1961 was the highest recorded since 1891-1901 and the highest everin Berwick and Peebles Counties. In Northern Northumberland, which has sufferedsimilar decline in population for some considerable time, the decrease was as muchas 16 per cent during the decade higher than any other part of rural North-east england and the rate has been accelerating.12. The decrease was as great among females as among males-indeed in Roxburgh,Peebles and Selkirk Counties the 1951-61 rates were slightly higher for females than for males. The population of all the towns in the region as a whole decreased as wellas that of the countryside, though at a slower rate; and indeed the only part to showany inter-Censal increase was Melrose County District which contains the agriculturalservicing, administrative and housing centre of St. Boswells. Another, if uncertain,exception has been Jedburgh. Its population increased greatly after the arrival of theNorth British Rayon Company in 1929, decreased after its failure in 1956, but has remained about level since an engineering firm came to the town in 1959.13. This 1951-61 rate of decrease in the Borders was considerably greater than thecorresponding decline in the Highlands commonly regarded as a heavy loser in thisrespect. The following table compares the make-up of the 1951-61 change with thatof the seven Highland Counties and with the Scottish average:	1961 Census Enum-erated Popula-tion	1951-61				Net change No.      %	Natural Increase No.      %	Net Migration No.      %Borders Region	128,618	8595    6-3	h   1329 -i 1-0	9924 ..... 7-2Western Area	74,983	- 3780 -4-8	241   ! 0-3	-   4021      5-1Eastern Area .	53,635	- 4815 -8-2	1088   1 1-9	5903     1017 Highland Counties .	277,716	- 8070 -2-8	-f-   7116  t 2-5	15186 - 5-3Scotland  .	5,178,490	182075  1 1-6	-1-336776  i 6-5	254701      4-914. The table shows that a distinctive feature of depopulation in the Borders is thelow natural increase, especially in the Western Area. This has two aspects. The pro-longed migration of younger people has lowered the proportion of married women inthe population and raised that of old people, so lowering birth rates and keepingdeath rates relatively high. This is a feature common to most of rural Scotland. Butin addition, the fertility of marriage is peculiarly low in the Western Borders, unlike the Highlands. The causes of this are not fully understood, although they may be related to the high proportion of women, including married women, who are at workin the textile factories and their relatively high standard of living.15. The implications of these trends are serious for the future. The number of married women of child-bearing age (16-44) fell from 11,133 in the four ScottishBorder counties in 1891 to 10,140 in 1901, rose to 12,834 in 1951 and fell to 11,645 in1961. In 1961 the women in this group represented 11-5 per cent of the population in

these counties, a figure lower than the corresponding percentage of 12-7 for scotland as a whole. The decline in fertility already mentioned also began about 1890, and aftervarious fluctuations was 86 per cent of the Scottish rate in 1960-62. This means thatin 1960-62 the annual average number of births would have been about 1,750 if thefertility rate in these counties had corresponded to that for Scotland as a whole. (Thefertility rates for the Border counties and for Scotland in 1961 were respectively 126-1and 147-5 legitimate births per thousand married women aged 16-44.) The annual average number of births in 1960-62, however, was only 1,537. On current migrationtrends, births on this scale will be insufficient over the long-term to sustain the popu-lation of the Border counties at its present level. The effect of size of family, and ageon marriage, on fertility will be examined when the results of the 1961 census are published. It is clear, however, that these long-standing trends discernible in the local population and unfavourable to its maintenance are very relevant to any search for effective remedies.16. The net outward migration rate in 1951 61 was also higher than the Highlandand Scottish averages, and in the Eastern Area it was twice as high. Estimates for1955-63 for the Counties of Berwick, Roxburgh and Selkirk (derived mainly from theNational Health Service Register) suggested that about a quarter of the net loss wasto Central Scotland (mainly to Edinburgh) and three-quarters outwith Scotlandaltogether, divided equally between England and overseas. There were large grossmovements, especially to and from nearby parts of Central Scotland, amounting to3,100 out and 2,600 in per year (excluding overseas). The limited evidence available from Census and Ministry of Labour sources suggests that the outward movementcontains a high proportion of younger people and the inward movement an appreciableproportion of elderly and retired people.* The size and character of the gross outwardmigration is therefore more significant than the relatively small net figure alone. It isquite probable that many who leave the Borders for Central Scotland, especially forfurther education and training, subsequently form part of the large outward migrationfrom that region, and are so lost to Scotland.17. A wide variety of local sources confirm the view that this heavy outward migra-tion is caused by the reduced demand for labour in agriculture and other primaryindustries through continuing mechanisation and improved efficiency; and the restrictednumber and range of other jobs available in the region, especially for men and thosein professional, technical and clerical careers.Age and Sex Composition18. In 1961 the proportions of children, working age and elderly population indifferent parts of the Borders were as follows:	Western Area	Eastern Area	Jedburgh	Berwick	Other Towns	ScotlandUnder 15,          %	22-6	23-5	24-9	24-5	21-5	25-815-64,               %	62-6	62-6	62-5	62-2	62-5	63-765 and over,        %	14-8	13-9	12-6	13-3	16 0	10-5Of the towns in the Western Area, Jedburgh is the one whose age structure most closelyapproximates to the Scottish pattern. This is attributable to the immigration, already*An analysis of what happened to different age classes of the population in the 4 TweedCounties between the 1951 and 1961 Censuses shows that after making an allowance for deaths,the net effect of migration ranged from a loss of 25 per cent in the school leaver class (thoseaged 10-14 in 1951 and 20-24 in 1961) to a gain of possibly 5 or 10 per cent in the retirementclass (those aged 55-59 in 1951 and 65-69 in 1961).

mentioned, of young workers to the North British Rayon Company in the 1930s.Berwick-upon-Tweed in the Eastern Area appears at first to be in a similar categorywith a relatively high rate of natural increase as well as migration loss. But this is tosome extent explained by the fact that a number of what are really Berwickshire birthsare registered in the town. Allowance for this also corrects the impression that Berwick-shire shares fully the Western Borders&apos; low fertility rate.19. More unusual is the appreciable imbalance of the sexes in the Western Area andin all the towns, with again the notable exception of Jedburgh:	Western Area	Eastern Area	Jedburgh	Other Towns	ScotlandFemales per 100 males. 1961	113-7	108-8	105-7	11S-5	108-part 111INDUSTRY AND EMPLOYMENT20. The character of industry and employment in the Borders is closely consistent with this picture of a declining and imbalanced population. It is dominated by twoindustries, agriculture and textiles. The first no longer generates the employment and support services in the area that it once did, and textiles, just because they are virtuallyalone in manufacturing industry, do not afford sufficient variety of opportunity to hold the young.21. The scale of their dominance may be seen from the fact that the first, withfishing and forestry employs about one-fifth, and the second about one-third of thetotal employees. The comparable figures for Scotland as a whole arc 4-4 per cent and4-8 percent. The textile industry provides over four-fifths of the employment in manu-facturing industries compared with one-seventh in Scotland: the woollen cloth section,centred in Galashiels, employs slightly more men than women while the knitwearbranch, centred in Hawick, has more than 60 per cent females. In the area as a wholefemales make up about 40 per cent of the insured population; Hawick local officearea has the highest proportion, and Jedburgh/Kelso the lowest.22. Manufactures other than textiles and many of the service industries arc under-represented in the Borders in relation to its population-a further reason in itself for social dissatisfaction, especially among the young. Opportunities arc thus extremelyrestricted especially for senior school leavers at a time when young people are far lessready than before merely to follow traditional local employment.23. Unemployment is slight the level is the lowest of any district in Scotland sincethe war, and there is a correspondingly acute shortage of labour. The annual averagepercentage of wholly unemployed did not rise above 1 percent until the textile recessionof 1958; even then it was only 1 -4 per cent. Male unemployment has been higher thanfemale but over no year has it been greater than 1 -5 per cent in 1958 and 1959. Femaleunemployment has exceeded 1 per cent by a small margin only during years of textilerecession. Unemployment is higher in Jedburgh, Kelso, Eycmouth and Berwick-upon-Tweed Local Office areas than in the others. In the twelve months to February, 1965the corresponding figures were 1-3 per cent and 2-1 per cent. While total employmentdecreased marginally between 1960 and 1964, female employment was stable while there was decline in the predominantly male employing industries of agriculture,forestry and fishing, mining, chemicals, construction and transport and communica-tions. But even with the closure of North British Rayon in Jedburgh, the percentage

there since the war has never exceeded 2-2 per cent. The indications are that Borderers,if threatened with long-term unemployment, tend to leave the area which, as we have seen, often means going South or overseas.24. The accompanying labour shortage in the Western Area has inhibited theexpansion of the hosiery industry and imposed great handicaps on the woollen industry.With the contraction of employment in agriculture, and the ageing and unbalancedpopulation structure, this produces in the Borders a situation which is perhaps uniquein the U.K. Superficially all is well. The countryside is prosperous with its large and well-kept farms; in the towns, the unemployment level resembles that of the EnglishMidlands. Yet this apparent prosperity and lack of the more obvious signs of industrial and social malaise conceal a condition of growing precariousness. This is suggestedmore fully by the following examination of employment.MINOR SOURCES OF EMPLOYMENT25. Five sources of employment may be noted in this category.Manufacturing Industry other than Textiles26. Outside the textile industries, which arc discussed separately, manufacturing industry is on a small scale. There were at mid-1963 forty-six establishments in thefour Scottish Border Counties employing more than 11 persons. At mid-1963 theyemployed nearly 2,200 persons compared with over 1,800 in forty establishments at mid-1958.27. The most important and interesting newcomer between 1958 and 1963 was anengineering firm, a subsidiary of an American parent company, which set up in Jedburghin 1959 following notable efforts by the town to attract new employment after the closure of North British Rayon Company in 1956. In 1960 they started production ofprecision tools with a labour force of some 40 people. By 1965 they were employing280, over two-thirds male, and are now the largest Border manufacturing concern out-side textiles. The relatively balanced age, sex and population structure of Jedburgh hasbeen mentioned, and it was precisely the predictable and in the Borders unusual-reserve of labour (and housing) in the town which made the venture possible. Valuableas some of the other larger undertakings (none employing over 200) are to theirlocalities, their contribution to the general widening of employment opportunity inthe Borders as a whole is limited.Forestry28. Forestry is one of the few growth industries in rural Scotland. It is of particular value in the Borders as a source of male employment, and is under-represented whethermeasured by acreage, output or employment. However, although the new pulp mill atWorkington will probably in due course afford fringe benefits to Border forestry, the impact of the industry on the Border economy as a whole is likely to be only marginal.This is primarily due to the dominant position of a highly productive livestock industryusing the same kind of land as forestry. Thus, while figures provided by the forestry commission show a welcome forecast of increased employment, the total by 1980 will reach only 300 (employment offered by private forests is approximately the same)compared with 1,500 in the three south-west Counties of Scotland. It will be concen-trated in areas south of Hawick and in Pccblesshire. As it is the current tendency foran increasing number of those employed in forestry to live in the larger villages andeven towns, the contribution of forestry will incline to be a minor benefit to the economy as a whole rather than a stabilising influence in the countryside. Although the southernboundary of Roxburgh lies close to the Northumberland forest of Kielder, the largeststate forest in Britain, it is expected that its output will be used almost entirely inNorthern England.

Fishing29. The fishing industry is of considerable economic importance to Eyemouth andthe smaller ports of Burnmouth and St. Abbs. In the last four years the total value oflandings of white fish has been about  300,000 and of shell fish  63,000 to  87,000.Most of the fish landed is sold at first hand on Eyemouth market or sent to Newhaven,but small quantities are also sent south. Work on a major harbour improvementscheme at Eyemouth was started in 1963 and is now completed. It is just possible thata modest amount of additional traffic will in future be attracted to the harbour, andthat this could stimulate certain fringe investment and employment in the burgh.At Bervvick-upon-Tweed the salmon fishing industry employs about 140 men during the season from February to September each year in addition to those engaged in the cold storage and distribution of the product. New premises, including a warehouse and icestore house at Spittal have recently been built.30. It is hoped that the improvements at Eyemouth will help maintain the fishingfleet, for in the period 1960-64 there has been a steady decline in the number of fishermenin the district from 250 to 195 the renewal of a pre-war trend and one which has alsodeveloped in the Scottish industry as a whole. It is argued that young men are notbeing attracted to the industry because of the long hours and arduous work, whilescarcity of fish in the last few years has undoubtedly depressed the local industry&apos;sfortunes. So far as the inshore fleet is concerned there is now some prospect of an im-provement in fish stocks, and in earnings, which may stimulate recruitment. In the longer term it would appear that if production in this industry is maintained it will beby still more efficient operating and catching methods and with a rather smaller labour force. In other words the fishing industry cannot be looked to as a widening source ofemployment. Like agriculture, the way to improvement probably lies through sheddinglabour.Tourism31. The Borders are less spectacular than the Highlands but contain much splendidand varied scenery. Angling is the main and abundant recreational attraction, andthere is wide scope for walking, pony-trekking, water ski-ing, and relatively traffic-freemotoring. The abbeys, historic houses, Roman remains and colourful literary associa-tions have a complementary appeal.32. Employment in catering and hotels in the Borders in 1963 amounted to about per cent of the insured population. Peebles exchange area, which includes the 300-bedHydro, has double this. The total number of employees in catering/hotels was over1,400, more than two-thirds of whom were females. Although hoteliers in the area seemso far to have adapted themselves to the general shortage of labour, it might easily bean obstacle to expansion. The figures of persons accommodated remain steady at about 3 per cent of the Scottish totals over the whole period. The share in the nationaltotal of accommodation available has fallen marginally from 3-5 per cent to 3-2 percent. The number of Youth Hostel bed nights has remained static since 1954.33. As this suggests tourism is not a major industry in the Borders. Most visitors to scotland are heading for Edinburgh and the Highlands, treating the area merely as a prelude. If they stop at all they tend to do so in passing only or on day trips fromEdinburgh. As the charms of the Borders are reticent and not fully yielded on so cursorya view, this naturally limits the income that can be derived from such traffic, and ascommunications with the south are improved the position is unlikely to change.34. The most significant potential of the Borders probably lies in its convenience asa day or weekend resort for those living relatively close. As car ownership increases the distance people are prepared to go for a day or even half-day is widening and the capacity of the Borders to offer the services to meet this new kind of demand could be considerable.

Of!Service Industry35. Service Industry, including construction, is one of the fastest growing sectionsof the British economy. In the Borders it is not only under-represented in virtually all categories compared with the Scottish average, but is also growing more slowly. From1959 to 1963, the percentage of insured employees in services remained around 45 percent compared with an increase from 56 per cent to 5S per cent in Scotland as a whole.This is, of course, a symptom of the generally declining population and in one sensemay give no cause for surprise. But it nonetheless exacerbates the situation and pre-cipitates further decline. The reduction in railway employment, for example, is to beexpected, but the shortfall in a variety of sectors both limits employment opportunitiesand by the lack of the services themselves makes the environment less attractive. Withthe possible exception of Berwick-upon-Tweed and Galashiels the Border towns revealrather limited shopping, eating and entertainment facilities for places of their size. Thesuccess of the recently opened Kelso skating and curling rink is an example of con-temporary enterprise made conspicuous by its rarity. Yet modern amenities like theseare increasingly demanded, especially by the young, and their limited provision is undoubtedly a significant disincentive to remaining in the Borders. Prices tend to be high compared to the cities, and as car ownership increases, more people tend to shopin Edinburgh or Newcastle.AGRICULTURE36. Agriculture is one of the two dominant industries in the Borders with about ,700 regular male employees on nearly 1,500 full-time farms in 1964. In the WesternArea, where the agricultural economy is based on livestock, particularly sheep, andfeed crops, the industry is subsidiary to the urban manufacture of textiles. But in theeast, where cash cropping of cereals is of considerable importance in the rich Morse,agriculture is unchallenged.37. Throughout the industry there has been a trend towards greater mechanisation.In the Eastern Area with its established and increasing emphasis on cereal growing ithas been almost complete. With this has gone a substantial reduction in the labour force a fall of 23 per cent between 1953 and 1963, which is the same as for scotland as a whole. There has, however, been only a small reduction in the number of farmers.This decline in employment has not had any noticeable adverse cfleet on production,except perhaps in the more outlying areas, and the output of crops and livestock as awhole has increased. The decrease in employment is largely due to falling demand for labour through mechanisation and increased efficiency, though there may be somepockets among outlying hill and marginal farms where there is a shortage.38. The rate of decline in the labour force in recent years has been greatest for regular male workers over 65, for part-time, casual and seasonal workers and forwomen. Changes in population structure suggest that it may also have been heavy formale workers aged 20-44. The present ratio (11 per cent) of youths under 20 to allregular male workers, is lower than in Scotland as a whole (15 per cent). In the past the ratio of youths in the Borders has traditionally been lower than in other parts ofScotland a difference probably due to the relative unimportance of dairying and smallfamily farms. The present intake is probably still sufficient to meet the reduced labour requirements of the future provided there is little or no wastage, which had alsotraditionally been less in the Borders than elsewhere.39. There is still probably considerable scope for reducing labour and increasingoutput and efficiency on the cropping farms in the Eastern Area through furthermechanisation and the adoption of improved management practices. On the hill andupland farms, where livestock are the main enterprise, the scope may be less, buteconomic pressure on farm incomes is likely to be greater and the need for economies in labour will be no less urgent.

40. As Border farms are large there may well be relatively little amalgamation of units except, perhaps, in the hills and uplands where economic pressures are likely tobe greatest. There is no shortage of farmers&apos; sons wanting to get a farm of their own.The difficulty for them is to find the capital required, as a consequence of the fiercecompetition and high prices. Thus, most of the fall in agricultural employment islikely to be in farm employees and this could amount to 20 to 25 per cent (or 1,100to 1,400 workers) in the next ten years. With some reduction in the number of smallerfarms and farmers, the total fall in agricultural employment could be of the order of1,200 to 1,500.41. A reduction on this scale is likely to be necessary if farmers in the Borders as elsewhere are to maintain their incomes in the face of greater rises in costs than infarm product prices. In other words, a smaller labour force will be a corollary of amore efficient agriculture.42. The indirect employment provided by Scottish farming as a whole in ancillaryand service industries is estimated to amount to about 70 per cent of the number of farmers and workers directly employed in agriculture. Border farming, with the element of self-sufficiency given by its concentration on sheep and beef cattle, probablygives rise to less ancillary business than other areas. Despite some important auctionmarts such as those at St. Boswells and Kelso, the relative unimportance of dairycows, pigs and poultry means that there is less dependence on the use of purchasedfeeding stuffs, and much service and ancillary industry is situated outside the areaaltogether. There are a couple of firms making agricultural implements but on a small scale and the national manufacturers have most of the market through local agents.Only the large firms can afford the advertising and technical advisory work customaryat present and it is unlikely that the future will bring much development in thesetrades in the Borders.43. This picture of a progressive and reasonably stable industry is of coursedependent on world trade in wool and meat, and on Government policy, for in common with farming in the U.K. generally farm incomes have been heavily dependent onExchequer support both from direct payments and guaranteed prices. By and large,the present structure of Border farming seems likely to provide adequate livelihoodsfor the decreasing number able to remain in it. The size of units and their managementmeans it is relatively well placed compared to other areas to adapt itself to changes thatmay be necessary. The development of broiler production and such crops as peasfor processing in the Merse might come about if there were greater economic pressuresthan exist at present, and there may well be some intensification of cattle and sheepproduction on the better grassland. This could be the basis for more local slaughteringand processing enterprises.44. The industry therefore offers the possibility of diversifying to some extent tomeet the introduction of local industries processing its products. But it will in itselfhold insufficient people on the land to sustain the balanced rural economy of the past.Indeed increasing mechanisation and the increasingly specialised techniques of modernfarming are likely, by changing the character and quality of the labour force, them-selvcs to lead to higher wages yet another pressure for reduction in numbers.45. Paradoxically, though its own greatly reduced demands for labour are eontri-buting to the situation of labour shortage in the Borders generally, the agriculturaleconomy is not itself likely to be affected by it. In the first place, as we have seen,advance lies in further labour shedding; and there is likely to be no shortage of farmersthemselves. Secondly, as the reservoir of local rural population disappears, and as the farm worker becomes more of a technician, labour is likely to be drawn to the land from a much wider catchment than before, even from the cities.46. But even if the agricultural economy is not threatened itself by depopulation,social and economic problems of a more general kind are created for the maintenanceof tolerable standards of life for those who remain in the country. The expense and

difficulty of keeping up adequate services, especially education, has been mentioned.So has the lag in service employment. The rural population has become extremelymobile certainly; most farmers have a car, many two, and those farm workers who do not have one as well often have a motor cycle or scooter. The disadvantages ofisolation are thus greatly reduced. But by the same token the range of personal move-ment is greatly increased; and coupled with the drop in population this is undermining the importance of the villages and small towns which once served a more populouscountryside.47. In the Western Area the existence of substantial towns meets the needs of the rural hinterland. In the Eastern Area only Berwick-upon-Tweed supplies such a focusand it is questionable whether it can continue to do so indefinitely.TEXTILES48. The textile industries, employing about a third of the total insured populationof the Borders, are concentrated almost wholly in the towns of the Western Area.They have been examined for the purposes of the study with the co-operation of theHawick Hosiery Manufacturers&apos; Association and the Scottish Woollen Manufacturers&apos;Association, and of a number of individual firms. Questionnaires were drawn upcovering a wide range of activities and circulated to a representative cross-section ofthe two sectors of the industry. The answers form the basis of the following account.49. The textile industries, including silk weaving and textile finishing as well aswoollens and hosiery, were able to increase their labour forces by nearly 1,000, or about 7 per cent between 1951 and 1963. But the trends in the woollen and hosierysides were very different. The labour force in the woollen industry fell by about 1,000,or more than 10 per cent, while that in hosiery increased by over 1,700, or about 40 percent. A peak was reached in the woollen industry in 1957 and in hosiery in 1961.50. Continuing depopulation and the growth of the hosiery side of the industry have combined to produce a situation of acute labour shortage. Competition for bothmale and female labour between the industries and between individual firms has becomesevere. Wastage is very high, particularly in the younger age groups, and the woollenindustry has had difficulty in recruiting and retaining a sufficient number of youngrecruits to replace its normal rate. Both industries rely on and indeed could not continueto operate without a very high proportion of part-time labour, particularly oldermarried women; both industries have been forced to bring in a substantial number offemale workers daily from outside the Borders; and both industries have been forcedto set up branch factories, in other parts of Scotland, Northern England and in NorthernIreland. Attempts have been made by some enterprising firms to encourage the rccruit-ment of workers from Glasgow, with the promise of overspill houses to assist them-with modest success. All these measures have still left the industries short of labour.They are forced to use and train inexperienced labour only to lose it again after ashort period, and to rely heavily on part-time married female labour and also maleand female labour over the age of normal retirement.51. The two sides of the industry are now examined separately in rather more detail.The Woollen Industry52. The Border woollen industry employs over 6,000 people about 40 per cent of manufacturing industry in the Borders. It forms about half the woollen industry inScotland and the trend in employment has been reasonably stable over the last fewyears. For ten years or so it has formed some 3.1 per cent of the woollen industry in theU.K. About half total production is exported, but output has shown little growth inthe past decade.

53. The traditional product is woollen and some worsted cloth. The woollen- cloth,popularly known as *tweed&apos; after a happy accident by which the name of the riverbecame attached to the material, is recognised as among the finest of its kind in theworld. The industry has in the past depended on quality, specialising in short exclusiveruns, and having a flexible and highly developed design policy sensitively adapted to different markets and changing tastes. Demand is high, but the industry is now presented with particularly difficult choices. There are those who argue that themarket for high quality products will diminish and that the industry should increasinglymove towards the greater production of cloth more suited to the mass markets.However, bulk production requires modern machinery and three shift working. Thereare few individual Border firms which can afford modern high speed machinery andin any event there is insufficient labour available to provide three-shift working in allthe mills. This leads to the further argument that the solution lies in rationalisation withfewer units but which could afford to re-equip on a large scale and for which therewould be adequate labour. Against the protagonists of this school are those whocontend that the Border industry has been built up on quality and exclusiveness, that itwould be folly to try and compete with the mass producers elsewhere, notably in yorkshire, and that it would be preferable to concentrate on the type of business withwhich they are familiar.54. It seems likely that the industry could benefit by an element of mass productionprovided that at the same time sufficient units also preserved its reputation for exclusive-ness and quality. The trend to mass production is already apparent. This has beenassisted by a grouping of some firms with a view to concentration of resources and bythe acquisition of others by outside interests able to provide adequate resources tofacilitate modernisation. These processes will no doubt continue.55. Such problems of policy and management are serious but labour shortage isthe most intractable difficulty facing the industry. It shows itself in many ways. Theexpansion of many firms is prevented by lack of weavers; some have spare capacity andeven idle looms. So reduced is the intake of school leavers, and so heavy the loss ofyounger workers by migration that retired postmen and railwaymen in their sixties andseventies are being recruited and trained. Many firms also spend considerable sums ofmoney importing workers daily from as far away as Dalkeith, a source which is likelyto diminish as the employment prospects in that area steadily improve. If the prospectof working in the wool textile industry has become relatively less attractive to thelocal young, the industry has also made an insufficient attempt to attract labour fromother parts of Scotland in conjunction with houses provided by the local authorities,and particularly from Glasgow with the local inducement of overspill houses. But thelabour shortage generally in the Borders is part of the total decline and imbalance ofthe population in the area explained in Part II.56. Yet there are ready markets for Border tweed and a real potentiality for growth in a balanced industry if the labour existed, as the record of some firms can show.The Hosiery Industry57. Hosiery employs about 6,000 people in the Borders more than a third of manufacturing industry. The trend has been slightly upward in the past few years.Its share of the U.K. industry was 3.1 per cent 10 years ago and increased to 4! per cent by 1958, but has been stable since. Almost 50 per cent of the product is exported, worthsome  5.1m. a year. Unlike the woollen industry which makes cloth only, the hosieryindustry is both a textile and a garment industry, whose products range from dressesto socks and underwear. It produces medium to high quality garments mainly in wool,and specialises in the use of cashmere.58. Market conditions have helped hosiery to be distinctly the more expanding halfof the textile industry over the last few years. Its terms and conditions have provedmore attractive to the younger age groups and as a result it has managed to securethe larger part of school leavers going in to the textile industry in the area.

59. But for all this, hosiery shares many of the same constricting circumstances which affect the woollen industry. Its dominance, particularly in Hawick, limits choice ofemployment. Then the industry is even more dependent than wool on female labour,and many of the dexterous skills can be learned fully only by the young which limits the range of recruitment. The shortage of employment for men in turn reduces the pool of female labour too. Signs of this situation are the daily importation of labourover considerable distances by company transport. Firms have also had to set up newbranches in other parts of Scotland and outside the country altogether-wherelabour is more readily available, despite considerable disadvantages. All these factorshave generally inhibited expansion.

South-West ScotlandPart ITHE STUDY AREA1. The area covered by this study embraces the counties of Wigtownshire, Kirkcud-brightshire and Dumfriesshire with the branch employment office areas of Girvan andCumnock in Ayrshire. The part of Dumfriesshire within the branch employmentoffice area of Langholm is included in the Borders study. The population in mid-1964was as follows:Dumfriesshire (excluding Langholm)Galloway (Kirkcudbright and Wigtown)Girvan Area of AyrshireCumnock Area of Ayrshire83,70057.00011,35041,800193,8502. Like the Borders, South-West Scotland is to a great extent rural in characterwith much high ground, but it has a long and varied coastline around which most ofthe settlements are threaded. Industry is more diversified. There is coal-mining along the northern limits from Sanquhar to Girvan and a considerable variety of manu-facturing industry in the Dumfries/Annan area. Nowhere is there found the dominanceof a single industry as in the textile towns of the Borders. Agriculturally, the areaspecialises in dairy-farming and is distinctive for the significant part played by the rural growth industry of forestry.3. In Dumfries, the area has a real regional centre, something that is lacking inthe Borders. Even those portions of the region which do not look to Dumfries- -mostof Wigtownshire and the Girvan and Cumnock areas are able to look towards anotherregional centre, Ayr. This tends to hold within the region more people in serviceemployment than in the Borders, which arc also subject to the strong pull of edinburgh and Newcastle. Also, although the countryside generally is losing population, some small towns are tending to hold it, and even gain occasionally. This is attributable toa number of causes, the most important being the high natural increase, the impact offorestry in the remoter parts, a reasonably diverse industrial economy within thecatchment of Dumfries, and the distance of the region from conurbations. All these things make it relatively self-contained.4. This character is reflected in the pattern of communications. Two trunk road and rail routes skirt the area to the east. Of these the more important as a through route,A74 with the Carlisle Beattock Glasgow railway, virtually by-passes the region. Theother, A76 with the Carlisle/Kilmarnock/Glasgow railway, climbs Nithsdale to linkAnnan and Dumfries with Cumnock and the Ayrshire plain and is an important regionalroute. But the main centres, and much of the population, have only extended and eventortuous links with Dumfries and Ayr and with one another. Most of the communitieslie on the southern boundary of the region at the mouths of its several river valleys.This produces a straggling system of road communications which it is virtually im-possible to shorten. For example, the main road between Dumfries and Stranraer,A75, winds for 79 miles linking the more important communities. A straighter, shorterroute, even if practicable, would really only serve Stranracr. And Stranraer&apos;s positionas the service centre for Wigtownshire, especially since it tends itself to look towardsAyr, could scarcely justify giving early priority to such an investment even when its

relationship to Northern Ireland is taken into account. The only railway services withinthe region beyond the two trunk routes already mentioned are on the lines fromStranraer via Ayr to Glasgow, and via Ayr and Mauchline to Carlisle and the South,on which freight and passenger (including sleeper) services will be maintained.5. The very reasons which tend to make land transport circuitous make water transport rather more attractive and coastal shipping uses seven small harbours on thelong indented coastline. This is rather more than one would expect to find in use today.Of these Stranraer is the most important with the twice daily &quot;roll on roll off&apos; vehicleferry to Northern Ireland, developed since 1963. The others are used for small irregularcargoes of such things as cement, timber, grain and fertilisers; Kirkcudbright is alsoused by Shell-Mex as a supply point for its land distribution depot. The disused war-time port of Caimryan, near Stranraer, is referred to in Part III (3).6. The provision of public services, especially education, presents problems in so large and, for much of its extent, thinly populated an area. Already in education and hospital services a policy of concentration on the main centres is being undertakenwhile ensuring that a reasonable standard of provision is within reach of the bulk ofthe population. The main centres for further education are the Dumfries TechnicalCollege, and for the northern and western part of the region, the technical colleges atAyr and Kilmarnock. More limited courses are available at Castle Douglas andStranraer.7. There are a number of locations suitable for a major water-using industry witheffluent problems, and one of these, in the Kirkcudbright area, would have the benefitof the tail race from the Tongland Hydro-Electric Station. The mild climate andparticularly the mild winters which permit the valuable early potato crops nearStranraer and Girvan is also an asset. Near Dalbeattie, along the banks of the RiverUrr, are extensive clay deposits suitable for the manufacture of high quality facingbricks. Distance from major centres of use has hitherto inhibited exploitation, butlong-term growth in the region could give them a new value. Other mineral resourcesinclude granite, which is still worked at Creetown (where it is used for making precastconcrete) and at Dalbeattie.8. As later analysis shows, the best prospect for the region lies first in capitalisingmore fully on the parts which are reasonably healthy in an industrial and demographicsense and lie in the national &quot;mainstream&apos;-Cumnock and above all Dumfries. Lackingthe natural resources which in the past stimulated population and industrial growth in central Scotland, Dumfries particularly commands a position, with Carlisle on theother side of the Solway, and possesses physical attractions, which could make it a promising centre for future expansion. Secondly, a reasonably self-supporting economymust be devised for the remoter areas (especially Wigtownshire from which migrationis and will otherwise continue to be heaviest) which will become an increasingliability if their population structure becomes seriously unbalanced.Part 11POPULATIONRecent Changes9. The population of the South-West counties has fallen steadily but slowly from its maximum in 1851 and the total fall since then has been only 11 per cent. Tins may be compared with 21 per cent since 1891 in the case of the four Border counties. Prom1921 to 1931 all three counties decreased and total migration loss and total natural increase were nearly the same as in 1951-61. From 1931 to 1951 all three increased,especially Wigtown and Dumfries, owing to military and industrial developments and much reduced outward migration from Scotland generally. Since 1951 Dumfries has

continued to grow while the Galloway counties have fallen back below their 1931figures and the South-West group of counties has decreased slightly. The followingtable sets out the changes in 1951-61.	1961 Census Enum-erated Popula-tion	1951-61							Net change No.       %		Natural Increase Mr,           o/ INO.           /0		Net Migration No.        %	Dumfries Galloway	88,440 57,994	f 2,780 -4,351	4-3-2 -7 0	4.908 - 3,421	4-5-7 4-5-5	-2,128 -7.772	-2-5 -12-5Total, 3 S.W.

The fact that the South-West taken as a whole was fairly stable in 1951-61 was largely due to the effect of its substantial rate of natural increase, in contrast to the borders. This in turn was related to both higher fertility and younger age structure inmost of the area. But there was a marked difference between the migration and resultingnet change in different parts of the region. Dumfriesshire showed small migration loss and moderate growth; Galloway a heavy migration loss one of the highest rates inScotland and substantial decline; and south Ayrshire a temporary net inward migra-tion (to mining areas in Cumnock), a natural increase estimated to be nearly double the Scottish average and a large net increase in population. From 1961 to 1964, growthcontinued in Dumfriesshire and, at a much reduced rate, in south Ayrshire (in theburghs only), while decreases continued in Galloway at a somewhat reduced rate.11. Analysis of National Health Service records for 1955-63 shows that there was asubstantial net loss by migration from the three Solway counties, nearly all of which(1,100 a year out of 1,300) was to England and overseas. Outward movements fromthese counties to the rest of Scotland were almost equalled by inward movements, and movements to Glasgow were, surprisingly, exceeded by those from Glasgow (2,591 and2,716) this is probably related to construction work at Chapelcross and on the re-building of A74. The main streams of internal movement were to and from the CentralBelt, especially between Dumfries and Lanark.12. In the Borders every burgh and County District (except that containing St.Boswells) has decreased since 1951. In the South-West half the burghs and a quarterof the Districts have increased. But these areas of increase are mainly in the east,associated with new employment in mining around Cumnock until 1961, and in manufacturing industry, atomic energy and services in and around Dumfries and Annan(1951-61-64). The areas of decrease cover virtually the whole area for SO miles west of Dumfries and north-east of Dumfries to the Borders, including all the agri-cultural districts and their smaller burghs. Depopulation is on a scale and at a ratecomparable with the Eastern Borders, but it affects communities thinly dispersed overan area three times as great. Even here, though, there are valuable pockets of increase or stability at the larger towns of Stranraer and Girvan and at forestry villages in westKirkcudbright, Carrick in south-west Ayrshire, and part of north Dumfriesshire.Age and Sex Composition13. The population structure of the South-West is younger than that of the Bordersand is ageing more slowly. Indeed the age composition and the changes within it are

similar to those of Scotland as a whole. For example, the percentages of Censuspopulation aged over 44 were as follows:195119613 South-WestCounties33-035-64 BorderCounties38-441-9Scotland32-434-l)This nearly &quot;average&apos; age structure is widespread, despite depopulation. The onlyplaces identified where the proportion of older people is appreciably above the Scottishfigure are the small burghs in Kirkcudbright County, and Newton Stewart, Moffat andLockerbie. These are also the only areas with little or no natural increase. Populationsappreciably younger than the Scottish average are found in Cumnock District andBurgh. Wigtown landward area and Stranraer. and in parts of Dumfries landwardarea.14. The balance of the sexes in the South-West is also fairly normal. The number offemales per 100 males is around 105 in each of the main sub-areas- slightly below theScottish average. The farming and mining rural districts, as is usual, have about equal numbers of both sexes, whereas most of the burghs have a preponderance of femalesabove the Scottish average, associated with service occupations and an elderly agestructure. In Annan, Sanquhar. Stranraer, Wigtown and Cumnock, burghs withyounger populations and rather different functions, the sex ratio is about average.The Future15. The balanced structure and natural growth of the population suggests that few,if any, major problems are likely to arise in the near future from a continuation ofrecent trends. In the three counties as a whole, a slight increase might occur as hasindeed happened between 1961 and 1964. Even though growth by net inward migrationin the South Ayrshire mining area had stopped in 1961-64, and even in the unlikely event of it stopping in the Dumfries/Annan industrial complex, the younger agecomposition of these populations should help to ensure at least their stability.16. However, substantial outward migration is likely to continue for so long asprimary industry continues to shed labour and other opportunities in the area arerestricted. There seems to be some time yet in hand before this distorts the populationstructure or weakens the traditional fertility and natural growth of the rural area as awhole; but the immediate problem spots, where this has already happened, are thesmaller rural servicing communities. One function of the study is to suggest which ofthese could most easily be assisted to become at least stable. In the rural hinterland(apart from forestry settlements) there is some social erosion, through a thinning outof the already sparse population, and, as in the Highlands, public transport to local and regional centres is deteriorating. Further developments in forestry, food processing,tourism and manufactures may, if they can be promoted in time, be sufficient in alimited number of places to prevent a spiral of social and demographic decline.Part IIIINDUSTRY AND EMPLOYMENTGeneral17. The South-West presents considerably more diversity in the structure, trends and problems of its economy than the Borders. In the whole of the South-West includingthe Girvan and Cumnock employment exchange areas total employees at 1963numbered about 65,000, of whom 9,000 were in agriculture, 9,000 were in coal-mining,12,000 in manufacturing and 34,000 in service employment.

18. The region is mainly dependent on primary industries, principally agriculture,but also mining and forestry. Manufactures are a relatively small but varied sector and services are well represented. If self-employed persons could be added, and thetotal working population accounted for, then agriculture (with some 3,500 farmers)would become relatively more important. Indeed the numbers working in agriculture,forestry and fishing together with their ancillary processing industries would amount to nearly a quarter of the regional total (and this is still excluding ancillary services);while those manufactures which are not based on primary industries would be limitedto only about 10 per cent of the regional labour force. The trends of employment since1951 have been an overall increase of about 4 per cent; a marked decline in all primarysectors; an increase in manufactures, mainly before 1958; and a small increase in services up to 1958 followed by a decrease since.19. Nearly half of the region&apos;s employment is concentrated in the eastern areaincluding Dumfries and Annan, where both manufactures and services are relativelyimportant, and which is mainly responsible for the growth in employment in the regionsince 1951. About one-fourth of employment is found in the north in the compact areasof Cumnoek, which has grown, and Sanquhar, both dominated by coal-mining but nowstarting to attract other industry; services are notably under-represented here and indeed for this purpose the Cumnock area looks to Ayr and Kilmarnock and Sanquharsouthwards to Dumfries. The remaining employment is spread out over the very extensive and rather isolated western corner, consisting of four employment exchangeareas in three counties. Here agriculture dominates and services are well represented notably more so than in the mining area (or in the Borders) but employment in generalis declining. In the Girvan exchange area there is also some mining and like Cumnoekit tends to look northwards to the rest of Ayrshire. Unemployment is above theScottish average in the Cumnoek. Sanquhar, Stranraer, Girvan and Newton Stewartareas.I. THE MAIN SECTORSAgriculture20. Agriculture is the most important single industry in both production andemployment. In the three counties it occupies 1 -3 million acres of land, of which800,000 are rough grazings, reflecting the upland character of most of the interior;400,000 are grassland, favoured by the mild and moist climate; and 100,000 are tillage,on which cash crops are little grown. The predominant types of farming are dairying(60 per cent of the farms and 70 per cent of the output) and the rearing of cattle and sheep. While cattle fattening farms are not common, fair numbers of fat cattle comefrom the dairy farms.21. Between 1953 -63 the number of cattle and sheep rose while those of pigs and poultry fell. The number of beef cows increased twice as much as in Scotland as a whole and the numbers of dairy cows in all three counties rose, compared with a generaldecrease in Scotland, and the region is indeed well suited to dairying and cattle produc-tion both by reason of the climate and because the farms are well sized and ratherlarger than those in upland Ayrshire for example. Dairy farms in the South-West are better able both to grow their own winter feed and to produce milk more cheaplyduring the longer grazing season. Next to dairy farms the most numerous type areupland farms depending more on cattle rearing (often of the dairy breeds) than onsheep. While both hill sheep and upland farms rely on the Calf and Hill Cattle and I fillSheep Subsidies to maintain profitability, they are in general more productive andremunerative than similar types of farm in many parts of the north and west Highlands.22. In 1963 the three counties had 8,300 farm workers, (full-time, part-time andcasual) and nearly 3,000 full-time farmers, giving a total of over 11,000 engaged in

agriculture. As a result of mechanisation, more labour-saving methods and increased efficiency, the number of farm workers fell by 22 per cent between 1953 and 1963,almost the same as the decrease of 23 per cent for Scotland. The fall in the number ofdairy workers can be expected to continue and although the possibilities of mechanisa-tion are much less on hill and upland farms, they also will probably have to make do with fewer workers. Cropping farms will no doubt continue to offer the best opportunities for labour reduction. The number of fanners is also likely to fall, though less rapidly than the number of workers unless amalgamation of units is more actively encouraged.Altogether it may be expected that over the next ten years the number of those engagedin agriculture might fall by about one-fifth that is by about 2,200 of whom the greatmajority would be farm workers rather than farmers.23. Dairying seems certain to remain predominant in the agriculture of the South-West. One possibility is that, with the demand for meat likely to remain keen, more beefwill be produced from the dairy herd. The hill and upland farms cannot usually changeover to other enterprises and development is confined to intensification and improvedoutput. The relatively small number of cattle fattening and cropping farms may find itbeneficial to take advantage of mechanisation by concentrating more on the productionof cereals. Agriculture in the South-West is relatively prosperous and progressive. the farmers make good use of the advisory service provided by the Agricultural college and there is a well established and enterprising co-operative society (West CumberlandFarmers Limited). Most of the farms can face the future confidently, the exceptionsbeing some of the smaller units which in dairying areas will have to amalgamate, while in the uplands the choice will be between amalgamation and afforestation.24. For the region as a whole the implications of this picture are of course simple.The countryside will become even more thinly populated than it is now and this w illlead to a diminution in the volume of service the smaller towns and villages are calledupon to provide. Insofar as the larger ones, like Stranraer, Girvan, Castle Douglasand Kirkcudbright and possibly Newton Stewart, can maintain a sufficient variety ofother employment they will be able to survive, and with increasing personal mobility,serve a wider area than before.Agricultural Ancillaries25. The number of businesses and of employees indirectly concerned with agricultureon the processing, supplying, retailing and transporting sides is not easily calculatedbut it is clearly of considerable importance especially in the various market towns.26. There are some sixteen milk processing firms employing a total of 1,100 people,11 of which are to be found in the Galloway dairying country between Stranraer andKirkcudbright, often in quite small settlements. Dairy-farming is well served bycreameries and it is unlikely that much can be expected in the way of further develop-ment. On the other hand the Scottish Milk Marketing Board arc rationalising and propose to close some of their smaller establishments and to build large new creameriesat Stranraer and Wigtown.27. The 8 auction markets in the region, which are mainly for the sale of sheep, arcwell spaced out among the towns, and each serves its local area. The two principalones are at Annan and Dumfries. There are twelve slaughterhouses and, unlike theauction markets, these are concentrated in the South-East. About 70 per cent of thetotal kill takes place in a triangle between Dumfries, Lockerbie and Eastriggs at fivelarge slaughterhouses, reflecting the strategic position of this area on rail and roadroutes.28. Bacon factories are to be found at six centres, of which by far the largest is atThornhill, Dumfriesshire. Finally there arc a number of firms offering an assortmentof agricultural services, including grain merchants (9 employing 11 or more workers),seed merchants (2), grain millers (2), several agricultural engineers and a manufacturer

of dairy utensils. These enterprises are distributed among the main centres but concen-trated particularly in Dumfries, Stranraer and Castle Douglas.29.. Looking at the combined effect of these agricultural ancillaries, some of the mare well distributed throughout the region but only two towns possess virtually all ofthem Dumfries in the east and Stranraer in the west. Thornhill, Lockerbie andCastle Douglas are next in importance.Forestry30. In 1964 the Forestry Commission had 28 estates in South-West Scotlandemploying a total of 730 people, one of the largest concentrations of State Forestryin the country. In addition, 130 men were estimated to be employed in associatedtransport and wood using industries and afforestation on private estates accountedfor the employment of a further 300 men. The total of 1,160 is not large in relation tothe region&apos;s total employment, or even that in agriculture, but forestry has considerablelocal significance in the area and is expanding.31. Most forestry employment is to be found in the three exchange areas of NewtonStewart, Castle Douglas and Dumfries, where 18 out of the 28 forests are foundincluding the six largest as far as employment is concerned. Almost half the forestryworkers in the South-West are employed in one main block of forests in the uplandsbetween the rivers Dee and Cree. A number of villages have been specially built forforestry workers, the most important of which arc Ac, with over 50 houses, andGlentrool. The small burgh of New Galloway, with a population of only 327, is thecommunity for 87 workers from two of the forests. The growth of employment on this scale has stabilised population in several forestry parishes in recent decades, especiallyin the west of Kirkcudbright County.Fishing32. Girvan is the only fishing port of any significance in the region and landingsthere are worth some  40,000 per annum from sixteen boats employing about sixtyfishermen. Round the coast from Girvan there arc thirty-four small boats employingbetween seventy and eighty fishermen and landing some  50,000 worth of fish ayear. There is also a small knot of fishermen engaged mainly on shrimp-fishing in theSolway from Annan where there is a small factory in which the catch is quick-frozen.This small-scale activity is most unlikely to expand employment and the most probablecourse is for the labour demand to shrink if such fishing as remains is to be competitive.Coal-Mining33. Coal-mining is the main industry in Cumnock and Sanquhar areas and inGirvan is on a par with agriculture and manufactures. In the fifties expansion led to considerable inward migration of miners from the declining Lanarkshire coalfield.This has now levelled off and a process of rationalisation is proceeding wherebynumerous smaller pits are closing and a few larger ones are being developed. Notableamong these arc Killoch and Barony. The National Coal Board estimate that whilethe number of pits may fall from 16 in 1965 to 9 in 1970, total employment will remainalmost unchanged.Manufacturing34. Although the manufacturing sector is not a large one, there is a fairly wide variety of industries, including textiles, chemicals, food processing, metals and engineer-ing. Some growth is occurring in most of these. A study of employment changes in the manufacturing firms employing 11 persons or over in the area suggests that there hasbeen an overall gain of 3,500 jobs between 1951 and 1964. Employment in chemicalsnearly trebled and in food and drink increased by about 80 per cent. Most areasshared in the increase in manufacturing employment but a few had decreases. Maybole

was affected by closures in the footwear industry, a reduction in employment intextiles occurred in Catrine and Kirkcudbright. The main increases in manufacturingemployment were in Dumfries Lockerbie and Annan where over 2,(XX) additional jobswere provided during the period.35. About a quarter of manufacturing employment is in textiles. Over two thousandworkers are involved, mainly in Dumfries and district and around Catrine andCumnock. Most of the remaining textile employment is to be found in Newton Stewart.36. The chemical industry showed the largest increase in employment as a resultof the opening of the U.K.A.E.A. plant at Chapelcross, and developments by LCI.Ltd. at Dumfries. Girvan has the only other sizable plant Alginate Industries Ltd.,producing chemicals from seaweed.37. The food and drink industries are more widely scattered over the whole area.Those ancillary to agriculture have been mentioned already-the many milk processingplants in Galloway, which make cream, butter, cheese, and powdered milk, and the bacon curing at Thornhill, Kirkcudbright and Girvan. Sea foods are manufacturedat Annan and soft drinks at Auchinleck.38. The metal using industries are mostly in the south-east: boilermaking at Annan,agricultural machinery at Dumfries and Castle Douglas, and steel radiators at Dal-beattie.39. These four manufacturing categories (textiles, chemicals, food and drink andmetals, etc.) account for about 80 per cent of the workers in the area. The remainingcategories and the establishments in them are usually small except for the importantrubber industry in Dumfries. Timber using industries are important in such centresas Annan, Newton Stewart, Creetown and Kirkoswald; and concrete slabs are made atCreetown.40. The experience of some thirty manufacturing projects has been examined bythe Ministry of Labour and the Board of Trade. The conclusion is that these firms are well satisfied with the quantity and, especially, the quality of labour they have obtained.Most of them, and particularly the U.K.A.E.A. at Annan, had to import skilled labour from outside the area, but at no time has this proved to be more than a tem-porary difficulty. In nearly all cases firms have given training to their local employees and this appears to have been successful, in some cases extremely so. One clothingfirm, forexample, find the female labour they are now recruiting to be of greatly superiorquality to that they could obtain before moving production to Scotland.41. The main attractions of the area for these firms appear to have been availablelabour and premises or sites (both in some cases left behind by closing Service orother establishments). Strategic location for North of England, Irish and Scottishmarkets and local persistence in drawing the attention of firms to these facilities havealso been important. Development District inducements have helped to attract linns toCumnock, Sanquhar, Stranraer and Girvan areas.Services42. Services, including construction, are well represented in the region except in themining areas and account for more than half of the employment in the three counties-approximately the same as the Scottish figure and markedly more than in the Borders.This would seem to be due to relative isolation from the cities and consequent self-sufficiency in the urban centres, especially Dumfries in the east and Stranraer in thewest; and possibly to the effects of a fairly buoyant population and industrial economy.Although it is nearly three times bigger and only 33 miles away (the same distanceEdinburgh is from Galashiels), Carlisle would appear not to be large enough toovershadow Dumfries as a regional service centre for the north of Solway.43. Services employment increased from 1951 to 1958 and has decreased slightlysince then. The main features have been a steady growth of professional and scientific

services, an increase of work on building and contracting schemes up to 1958 andsome fall thereafter, a persistent fall in public road and rail transport and a decreaseup to 1958 due to the closure of military establishments (which still employ a numberof civilians) at West Freuch near Stranraer and at Kirkcudbright.Tourism44. The tourist industry is an established one, but on a modest scale. It caters atrelatively few and rather small hotels for transit traffic Anglo-Scottish in the eastand Northern Irish in the west and for those attracted by the diversity and interestof the region&apos;s long coast-line, rivers and mountains, which make it a miniatureHighlands. In terms of employment in hotels and catering, tourism is at present not much more significant than in the Borders, the total figure in 1963 being nearly 1,400or about 2 per cent.45. But it is growing. This is shown by the relatively rapid increase in the numberof camping and caravan sites there are now 74 in the South-West, compared with24 in the Borders and the Tourist Board&apos;s figures of visitors for each of the threecounties shows an increase in the 1961-63 period during which Border figures actuallyfell. This is mainly a reflection of the greater variety and wider scope for the motoringtourist in this region. Its accessibility to North-West England is a considerable advan-tage, and with the completion of M6 in the early &quot;seventies Galloway will be almost aseasily reached by the conurbations there as the Lake District is now, which will increase its already growing appeal for still further weekend and &quot;second house&apos; recreation.Accessibility would of course be improved by the provision of air services, especially since the main tourist area in Galloway has lost its railway. The Forestry commission are developing the Glentrool Forest Park for tourism and recreation they already have one caravan site there and their recent directive from Ministers gives them morefreedom in this way. The largest of several other caravan site proposals in the area isone for 100 caravans at an ex-Army camp near Whithorn. Comprehensive physicalsurveys for tourism have been undertaken by the local authorities in Galloway andAyrshire.2. CHARACTERISTIC PROBLEMSUnemployment46. In January 1964 there were 3,700 wholly unemployed in the South-West; and inJuly, 2,700. Since 1954 unemployment in the region has increased markedly both inabsolute terms and in relation to Scotland as a whole. Thus the numbers unemployedrose nearly three-fold over the period 1954 to 1963 (four-fold among males and two-fold among females) and in Cumnock ten-fold (though this was so high because of thetemporary closure of the Barony pit). The average rate of unemployment went up from 1-7 per cent in 1954 (Scotland 2-6 per cent) to 4-7 per cent in 1963 (scotland-5 per cent). This appears to have been due largely to the run-down in the agri-cultural, mining, road and rail transport and civil engineering labour forces andthe closure of military establishments. There are appreciable numbers of unemployed in every local office area, but Stranraer has a rate almost double that for the area.In Dumfries/Lockerbie the rates are somewhat below the area and Scottish averages.47. As might be expected in a predominantly rural area, the seasonal element in umemployment is stronger than in Scotland as a whole. This is especially true inLockerbie, Castle Douglas, Newton Stewart and Girvan where the basic agricultural and service tourist structure predominates. There are proportionately fewer males andfemales unemployed under the age of 40 than in Scotland generally and proportionatelymore persons aged 55 and over; this underlines the relatively limited range of employ-ment in the area for the older, less active person. In terms of occupations uncmploy-ment reflects the industrial pattern, particularly highlighting the strong bias towards

primary and service industries, and underlines the scarcity of skilled labour, both maleand female, with experience in manufacturing industry. Thirty-nine per cent of thewomen unemployed were registered for service industry occupations, mainly hotels,catering and domestic service, compared with 17 per cent in Scotland.48. The proportion of females in the employed population is appreciably lower thanthe Scottish average and the activity rates (that is. the ratio of employees to civilpopulation over 15) are remarkably low for females compared with Scotland as awhole. It is clear, therefore, that in addition to the registered unemployed there is ahidden reserve of female labour in the South-West which is greater than the Scottishnorm. New factory employment opportunities would certainly attract a considerableflow of female labour from these reserves into ordinary employment; and this wastaken into account by three firms who recently decided to set up in Dumfriesshire.Travel-to-work49. The volume of travel-to-work is nowhere very large. In Stranraer and NewtonStewart areas communities are small, distances between them considerable, and public transport services infrequent. To Cumnock and Girvan there are inward movements ofmales from Ayr and Kilmarnock, to which there are also outward movements offemales. In the east there is a self-contained network of travel-to-work from Annan.Lockerbie, Castle Douglas and Sanquhar into Dumfries, especially of women. There isalso some travel-to-work from Annan and other areas into Carlisle.Labour Demand50. Labour demand in the South-West, as measured by average unfilled vacancies,has been less buoyant since 1959 than in Scotland as a whole. As measured by vacanciescirculated throughout Scotland, it is very small indeed and the only vacancies circulatedhave been for skilled workers (mainly motor mechanics and fitters among males andglove fingerers among women); three-quarters of the vacancies circulated have been for the Dumfries area. While &quot;take home&apos; earnings are apparently not high enough to attract labour from industrial centres unwilling to move for other reasons, they are not sufficiently low to deter persons who are attracted for other reasons to the South-West for example, in search of a house.Overspill51. Dumfries, Stranraer, Girvan and Cumnock have overspill agreements withGlasgow but it is clear that, Dumfries apart, the agreements are still on paper only.This is an indication of the failure of these areas so far to attract industry, especiallymale employing industry, in sufficient quantity. As a result the need to import labour,skilled or otherwise, has scarcely arisen. Even in Dumfries the impact of overspill has so far been slight. However, it is interesting to learn that volunteers on Glasgow&apos;soverspill register, who are required to name places to which they would be prepared togo, show a distinct preference for the South-West over other regions of Scotland out-side the Central Belt, and particularly favour Girvan and Stranraer. Despite the factthat few people express an initial interest in Dumfries, submissions and placings therehave been fairly satisfactory.School Leavers52. The great majority of school leavers at age 15 find employment near their homes more so than in the Borders. Fourteen per cent travel to work daily beyond their home area especially into Dumfries, Ayr and to a lesser extent Carlisle; and only4 per cent find employment beyond daily travelling distance. (These figures refer to the session 1963-64.) Among older school leavers a large proportion proceed to University,College, other training or to actual posts in professions away from home.

Prospects53. The greatest volume, variety and growth of manufacturing and service industryexists in the Dumfries area; and this the Scottish half of the Solway region is wherethe prospects of expansion both in the short and long term are best. Already, in a modest way, it is holding some of the population from further west which would other-wise be lost to Scotland altogether. The smaller towns of Annan, Lockerbie, Dalbeattieand Castle Douglas, all of which have certain special roles as manufacturing or servicecentres, lie within the economic sphere of influence of Dumfries and are close enough to reinforce and in turn be reinforced by-its further success.54. Also having scope for positive development are the Cumnock and Sanquharareas. Although in certain respects they look different ways, to Ayr and Dumfriesrespectively, they share certain common problems and lie on the same main communica-tions route. Their special value lies in the scope they afford for concentrating population and employment growth for their hinterlands, where it was formerly scattered amongsmaller and now declining settlements. The same is true of Girvan, which is alreadyproving a collecting point for concentration and growth of employment and services on the long coast between Ayr and Stranraer, and for a large surrounding area in southern Ayrshire.55. Stranraer is also growing. As the focal point in the extreme west it has importantservice functions for a wide hinterland, and recently has been able to attract some additional manufacturing industry as well. Provided the growth and variety of cmploy-ment can be sustained Stranracr is likely to be able, as Part II suggested, to continue tohold its own and perform its necessary service role.56. With Stranraer it is appropriate to mention the deserted war-time port ofCairnryan about five miles away. This is the only port on the whole coastline which can take ocean-going vessels. It has three berths capable of accommodating 10,000 tonnersat all states of the tide, off-shore moorings, rail and road access, utility services and room for factories or other premises. Conversely its handling facilities arc rather poor and ithas inadequate space for transit sheds. The lack of alternative development of thisformer port has been a source of concern to Stranracr and Wigtownshire Councilsever since it became disused some years ago. It was, however, built purely as a wartimeexpedient. For a number of years after the war the installation was used for de-fusingammunition and shipping it for dumping at sea. The Government then sold the portto private interests. Although a number of potential port developers have since been concerned with its promotion, its use for shipping operations has not yet come about.

North-East ScotlandPart ITHE STUDY AREA1. The study covered the counties of Angus, Kincardineshire, Aberdeenshire.BanfTshire, Morayshire, Nairn and also most of Perthshire. Nairn and the parts ofMorayshire, Aberdeenshire and Perthshire which are contiguous to the Highlands arealso considered in the study of that area.2. The study area falls naturally into two main divisions Perth and Dundee withthe lowland of Strathmore; and Aberdeen and its hinterland, including the wholenorth-east coast as far as Elgin. For convenience these two divisions are referred to asthe Dundee Area and the Aberdeen Area respectively. Finally, backing these two areas is a quasi Highland zone containing such towns as Grantown on Spey, Ballater andPitlochry. For most purposes it is necessary to consider these areas separately.The Dundee area. The Dundee Area includes the employment exchange areas north of the faywithin the arc from Blairgowrie to Montrose. It contains 43 per cent of the population(362,000) and 49-7 of the insured employees in the region and is dominated by thevaried industrial economy of Dundee and the small Angus towns. Dundee in parti-cular already has many affinities with the economy of the Central Belt, and theseare likely to increase with the improvement of road communications via Perth and, onthe completion of the Tay Road Bridge, with Fife. Geographically the most important feature after the containing massif to the north-west and the coast and estuary of theTay is the Sidlaw range. This splits the area into two: Dundee with a strip on each side the Carse of Gowrie to the west and the coastal plain to Montrose to the north-east; and the vale of Strathmore. Main communications follow these two lines. Perthis an important service centre, especially for agriculture. So are the relatively self con-tained market towns of Strathmore. Dundee, separated by the Sidlaw Hills, is rather less important in this respect than its size might suggest and services generally form a smaller proportion of its employment. Emerging as a nineteenth century industrial and commercial city, and regional port, it has maintained the Iion&apos;s share of these functionswithout so far markedly usurping the traditional role of the older towns. AgriculturallyAngus and the associated lowland part of Perthshire are versatile and resilient.Thelarge arable farms should be well able to adapt to changing circumstances betterperhaps than any others in Scotland. Conversely, the study shows that the effect on thesmall towns of a highly efficient modern agriculture, particularly well able to shedlabour, is to produce a sharply ageing population structure and a levelling off in thedemand for services, which already show signs of decline. Arbroath, which has anoverspill agreement with Glasgow, is the one town in the area which has succeeded inattracting new industry on any scale outside Dundee.4. Distances are nowhere great between the main centres-the furthest out, Brechinand Montrose are barely thirty miles from the centre of Dundee, and only twelve fromArbroath. Road and rail communications are generally satisfactory, and Dundee is tobecome a liner train terminal; but the nearest airport with scheduled services isTurnhouse, Edinburgh.The Aberdeen Area5. The Aberdeen Area contains about 51 percent of the total population and about46 per cent of the insured employees. It includes the exchange areas of Aberdeen,

Stonehaven, Inverurie, of the north-east coast fishing towns from Peterhead toLossiemouth, and of their hinterland Elgin, Huntly and Turriff. The primary industries of agriculture and fishing, and their ancillaries are particularly important almost asmuch at Aberdeen as elsewhere. Throughout the area there is a distinction between the coastal fringe, orientated towards fishing, and the hinterland of agriculture and smallmarket towns. There is little interchange social or commercial save their commondependence for certain purposes on Aberdeen. Agriculturally much of the area is strong,especially along the coast and particularly the coastal plain of Morayshire. Here,where the efficient agriculture might otherwise have accelerated depopulation, extensiveforestry and the presence of armed service establishments have kept the populationstructure particularly buoyant. But inland, especially on the higher ground, is an areaof small stock rearing farms which could well become vulnerable in the future. Theypreserve a relatively populous countryside which in turn does something to preserve theunusually thick scatter of small towns and large villages in the hinterland.6. The area was until recently served by a fairly extensive rail network. This is beingslimmed down to the main line from the south via Dundee and Aberdeen (which is tobecome a liner train terminal) and the line via Elgin to Inverness on which a fastdiesel service has been introduced. Roads are generally lightly trafficked and good,and although the railway closures may leave a few communities more exposed to theeffects of heavy snow, surface communications are generally excellent. The scheduledair service from Aberdeen direct to London is a valuable regional asset.The Areas Contiguous to the Crofting Counties7. While these areas contain economically similar elements upland and quasi-highland agriculture, and small service towns they do not form a coherent sub-region. They are really fringe areas with certain special common problems.Part IIPOPULATIONDistribution8. Over the region as a whole the basic contrast between the highland and lowlandzones may be expressed in the following average densities of population:Grampian Highlands: 45,000 people in 4,000 square miles, or 11 per squaremile.Coastal Lowlands: 805,000 people in 3,000 square miles, or 270 per squaremile (145 per square mile outwith the Cities).Despite the spread of population in this spacious region, the striking fact is that nearly three-quarters of the population is urban much the highest proportion of any of thefour study areas. This is due primarily to the size of the two cities (44 per cent), outsidewhich the burgh and landward populations are equal (28 per cent each). There is agreater weight of urbanisation (79 per cent) in the Dundee Area than in the AberdeenArea (65 per cent). Altogether there are 50 statutory towns the two cities at 185,000each; the two large burghs of Arbroath (20,000) and Perth (41,000); five small burghs of10,000-13,000; and forty-one small burghs of 700-7,000.9. The distinction between town and country is complicated by the fact that probably a third of these burghs provide no real urban services for their areas today, and by thepresence of many large villages which are not burghs, especially in Buchan. Many ofthese centres began as industrial settlements planned by and often named after theimproving lairds in the early 1800s, to resettle families off the land; others grew uppurely as fishermen&apos;s communities close by the string of harbours, or as riverside

mill-towns: and some of the original Royal Burghs and later planned villages whichwere well located have since become modern agricultural markets and service centres for wide rural hinterlands.Recent Changes10. After reaching their maximum population in 18SI-1911 most of the countiesmaking up the region have declined. However there was a slight increase between1931 and 1951 due to the much reduced emigration from Scotland during these years(which brought a slight increase also in the South-West and retarded depopulationin the Highlands and the Borders). Between 1951 and 1961 there was a decrease of only-one per cent, when heavy loss by migration (- 6-5 per cent) at above the Scottish average rate was nearly offset by the substantial rate of natural increase (4- 5-5 per cent); these rates of change are almost exactly the same as in the three South-West counties ofDumfries, Kirkcudbright and Wigtown.11. There was a much higher rate of net migration loss from the northern half of the region (-8-5 per cent) than from the southern (-4-2 per cent), which indeed had aslight net increase in population as a result; and there was faster growth in Dundeethan in Aberdeen. Net migration in the counties (excluding the cities) was - 12 per thousand per annum in Aberdeen, Banff, and Kincardine (with Galloway, the highestrate in Scotland); -7 in the counties of Moray and Nairn; -6 in Angus; and -4 inPerth (the only one below the Scottish average rate).12. The general regional picture of net change in enumerated population is shownin the following table.	1961 Census (&apos;000s)	1951-61 change No. COOOs)        %	Aberdeen City Remainder of North	185-0 266-3	-i- 2-6 -13-7	! 1-4 -5-4Sub-total North	451-3	-11-1	-2-4Dundee City .

An analysis of the local changes between 1951 and 1961 in districts, parishes andburghs shows a prevailing pattern of depopulation. This is especially true throughoutthe northern lowlands and the Grampian Highlands where decreases were normallybetween 10 and 30 per cent in rural areas. The burghs show less severe changes, beinggenerally in the lower categories of decrease, and 20 out of the total of 50 have small increases or no change. The main areas of increase are in or adjoining the urban areasof Aberdeen, Elgin and Lossiemouth, Fraserburgh and Peterhead, Dundee-Carnoustie-Arbroath and Forfar, Perth-Crieff and Pitlochry. Moray County is exceptional. Ithas enjoyed an increase in population owing to high natural increase and, in the burghs,a reduced loss by migration. This is associated with the presence of considerable numbers of R. A.F. and Fleet Air Arm personnel and their families. Employment arisingfrom large-scale afforestation has stabilised the rural population in south-west Perth-shire and one or two other areas. But in the extensive areas dependent solely orprimarily on agriculture, there are no signs of any stability.14. Although the mid-year estimates of resident population for 1961 to 1964 show a sudden increase in the region and in most districts, both urban and rural, except inAngus and Aberdeen City, the reasons for this arc largely adventitious. The Registrar

GeneraFs estimates of &quot;total population&apos; (including those absent from home in H.MForces and the Merchant Navy) for the same years show a static population (a smalldecrease in the north and small increase in the south) due to a slightly lower rate of migration loss and a slightly higher natural increase than in 1951-61.Migration15. High rates of migration out of the region, for 1951-61, are also revealed byanalysis of statistics from the National Health Service Register for the period 1955-63.Outside Central Scotland, much the greatest volume of net migration overseas and toEngland is from the North-East region. Its total net loss over 7,000 a year-amountedto 25 per cent of the total from Scotland. Only 17 per cent might be expected from the size of its population. A breakdown of migration (within the U.K. only) confirms theevidence from 1951-61 that the main weight of migration is from the Aberdeen area.The Dundee area has a share of migration only slightly greater than its population.16. This general picture is confirmed by the Ministry of Labour. Workers from theNorth-East are in particularly strong demand by a number of large English employers,who have a high regard for their quality. Of 3,350 workers transferred from Aberdeenand the north-east coast to England and Wales by the Ministry of Labour from1958-63, 828 went to Corby (where a North-East community has been established),220 to Rugby (electrical engineering), 155 to Scunthorpe (steel) and 97 to Luton(motor vehicles). The balance of 2,000 migrants had very diverse destinations through-out England and Wales. Construction workers moved in large numbers to London andto public works projects elsewhere. However, not all movements are recorded by theMinistry. Many migrants make their own arrangements, and there is also a strongtradition of movement into the Merchant Navy and to engineering employmentoverseas, especially to employment on tea, sugar and rubber plantations and to Canada.Generally, the rate of migration to England and Wales appears to be highest when thereis a general improvement in the U.K.. economy.17. Aberdeen University have made a socio-medical study of the motivation andcharacteristics of young migrants into and out of the city between 1951 and 1959. the composition of migrant groups is complex, ranging from the professional man follow-ing his career round the country, through the rural-urban migrant and the skilledworkman seeking opportunities, to the restless wandering of the socially unsettled.Strong occupational selection is revealed, the professional and highly skilled groupsbeing most likely to move. Among manual workers the most mobile are skilledmechanics, fitters and electricians. These particularly make their own arrangementsfor a move. They are very largely Aberdonian in origin, not earlier immigrants fromthe countryside. The main features of immigration of women before marriage are itspredominantly short-distance rural-urban nature. Those studied often showed dis-content with occupational opportunities and social life in rural areas and were attracted by the prospect of relatively light and clean town jobs, or of facilities for higher education and vocational training. Emigrants from Aberdeen were more numerousamongst those who had previously migrated into the city than amongst nativeresidents, especially where both spouses came from the south of Scotland or elsewhere.Aberdeen was found to conform to the classic pattern of an urban area in a setting ofdeclining rural employment a receiver of rural migrants and an exporter to more distant, predominantly urban, centres.Age and Sex Composition18. The following table shows that the age composition of the North-East as awhole is similar to that of South-West Scotland and not very different from theScottish average, the proportion of children being slightly lower and of old peopleslightly higher. The percentage aged 45 and over, as a single index of age, is also near

the figure for the South-West and a little higher than the Scottish average. It is appreci-ably smaller than the Borders. However, it is important to note that the rate of ageingof the population structure, as indicated by the increase in the proportion aged 45and over between 1951 and 1961, is higher than the South-West and the Scottishaverage and similar to the Borders.Age groups(Expressed as percentages of the total population of whole counties included under each heading)	North-East	South-Wcst	Borders	Scotland1961				Under 15	25-1	25-9	22-S	25-915 to 64	63-0	62-6	62-5	63-565 and over	11-9	11-5	14-7	10-645 and                 1961	36-8	35-6	41-9	34-9over                  1951	33-7	330	38-4	32-419. None of the counties or the cities diverges very greatly from the average agestructure for the region. But Perthshire, Angus, Kincardine and Nairn have ratherolder populations and in these counties especially, and others to a lesser extent, it is theburghs which give the weight of greater age.20. A comparison of age structure and recent birth and death rates for all the 50burghs shows that where the age index (45 and over) is about 39 per cent or higherthere is little or no natural increase in population (under 4 per thousand) and certainly not enough to survive even the Scottish average rate of migration loss.21. There are only some 12 towns in the whole region, apart from the two cities,where this is not true and which therefore appear to have a reasonable chance of replacing themselves without special steps being taken to introduce new population.Only two of these 12 towns the large Burghs of Perth and Arbroath are in Perth,Angus and Kincardine Counties. The remaining 10 are in Aberdeen, Banff and Moray.This difference may be in part one of marriage fertility and partly an economic onerelated to composition of the labour forces; that is, between textile towns (heavilyfemale employing as in the Borders) and retirement/tourist burghs on the one hand,and the larger and more balanced population of the fishing, agricultural marketingand Forces communities on the other.22. Sex composition differs appreciably from county to county but the averageposition is very similar to the Borders. This appears to be due to the scale of femaleemploying textiles and services concentrated in Dundee and Angus and in Aberdeen.North-East . .111-2South-West . .105-7Borders  . . .111-scotland . . .   108-5Females per 100 males, 1961Moray . . .   100-9Aberdeen . .   105-6Kincardine . .   107-9Banff   . . .109-8Perth . .  109-8Nairn   .       . .111-4Angus  .       . .111-7Dundee        . .114-1Aberdeen City .   117-2The Future23. It would be reasonable to expect from present trends a continuing substantialpopulation decline in the Aberdeen Area (and in all agricultural and fishing areasgenerally) and a slight increase in population in the Dundee Area. More than anything else this is related to the good employment growth and prospect in Dundee itself.24. Population projections for 1961-81 for the region as a whole, based on recentfavourable fertility rates, range from an increase of 20,000 to a decrease of 30,000according to whether migration is assumed to continue at below or above the 1951-61

rate. Another way of looking at the problem is to calculate the net reproduction (orreplacement) rates for the counties at 1961, which give an indication of the rate atwhich potential mothers are being replaced in the population, assuming there is nofurther migration. Given that condition, none of the counties would apparently fail toreplace its female population, although Angus would only just do so; Moray county and, more important, Dundee have replacement rates above the Scottish averageand the other counties are below average. This is in line with the general picture alreadyrevealed, and again shows the strength of Dundee in contrast to its hinterland.25. For practical purposes the meaning of the analysis is that outside the citiesthere are, in the north, several towns at which it would be possible without too much difficulty to achieve stability and a modest but self-sustaining population growth.This has already happened at Peterhead and Fraserburgh, for reasons which areexamined later. In the towns of Angus and Perthshire, on the other hand, the populationstructure and low natural increase suggest that not only employment but also newimmigrant population will be required in order to sustain growth.Part 111INDUSTRY AND EMPLOYMENTEmployment Structure26. Employment in the North-East seems at first sight only slightly more dependenton the primary industries and slightly less on manufactures than Scotland as awhole. But this is a superficial impression only, due to the dominating scale of the twocities, which provide nearly 60 per cent of all the jobs, and to understating of agriculturethrough the omission of about 11,000 farmers who are in the self-employed category.It also disguises the marked contrast, which Parts I and II would lead one to expect,between the Aberdeen area and the Dundee area. In nearly all employment exchangeareas, excluding the cities, the percentages in primary industry mainly agriculture and,in the Aberdeen area, fishing are characteristically high (from 20 to 40 per cent, evenexcluding farmers). And in the Aberdeen area many of the food and drink industries are closely linked with primary production. Here is the general breakdown:Industrial Distribution Employees 1964			Quasi	North-East		Aberdeen     Dundee		Highland	Region	Scotland	Area	Area	Area				Nos.

Manufactures in the Dundee Area, especially jute textiles, engineering and electrical goods, are strongly represented in the city and its surrounding towns;services are notable in Dundee and Perth and agriculture in the hinterland. In Aberdeenand the north coast the main sectors are agriculture and fishing, and their ancillaries;food processing, whisky, paper making and engineering manufactures, mainly inAberdeen, Peterhead, Fraserburgh and Keith local office areas; and services especiallyin Aberdeen City. In the Highland area agriculture, forestry, timber, tourism and con-struction are important and manufactures negligible.

28. Numbers of employees in employment increased only marginally between 1951and 1964; males suffered a decrease of about 5.000 whereas females increased by about,000. The increase was mainly in Dundee and Forfar areas and most of the North coast employment exchange areas; Aberdeen and the Highland areas decreased inemployment. The general tendency was for decreases in the period 1951-59 and for increases in the period 1959-64. There were consistent decreases in agriculture, fishing,ship building and marine engineering, transport and miscellaneous services. Textilesshowed some fluctuation but have been more stable in recent years. The main expandingindustries were paper and printing, engineering and electrical goods (in Dundee parti-cularly). food and drink industries, and services in general.Agriculture29. The landscape of North-East Scotland is predominantly rural, but not all of it isdominated by agriculture. Forestry is important over much of the higher ground andthe agriculture of the region is predominantly of a low ground type.30. The region is too large and too diverse to treat as a whole and the division into theDundee Area and the Aberdeen Area is useful. In the former lies some of the bestagricultural land in Scotland. The feeding of cattle and cash cropping are the mostimportant activities. Over a third of Scottish potato production, a high proportion ofit for the seed potato market, a similar proportion of the Scottish grain crop, and over half the Scottish acreage of vegetables for human consumption are grown in the area;while Perth and Angus between them contain nearly 80 per cent of Scotland&apos;s smallfruit acreage. Both fruit and vegetable production (mainly raspberries and peas) is primarily for canning, freezing or processing.31. By contrast the agriculture of the Aberdeen Area is predominantly of a livestocktype, and contains over one quarter of Scottish beef cattle. Because of its exposure,elevation and soil, much of the acreage is given over to grass and feed crop production.Pigs and poultry are also important, over 30 per cent of the poultry on Scottish farmsbeing in Aberdeenshire and Banffshire. Westwards along the Moray Firth, conditionsbecome more favourable, and in Moray, Nairn and along part of the Banffshire coastagriculture is of a cropping type, intermediate between the types which predominatein the two previous areas but with a greater emphasis on grain than in Perthshire andAngus. There is also a small fruit and vegetable area in Moray linked to the processingfactory at Fochabers.32. While there is relatively little dairying small concentrations are found near urbancentres, particularly those on the coast, such as Aberdeen, Fraserburgh and Banff.Herds tend to be quite large and the efficiency which this promotes more than balancesthe poor receipts.33. For the purposes of the study perhaps the most important point to note is thatthe average size of farm is smaller in the area centred on Aberdcenshire than in otherparts of the region. The owner occupied family farm employing no regular hired labour is common. Elsewhere, and particularly in Angus, the average size of full-time farm isappreciably above the national average. Yet it is precisely for the small farm area thatthe prospects arc bleakest. Insofar as there is concentration throughout much of the region as a whole on the production of meat or cereals, prospects are quite good (given no sudden changes in demand, international trading conditions or government subsidy policy). But the type of livestock farming typical of much of Aberdeenshire andBanffshire has recently been more heavily subsidised than any other farming (as distinct from crofting) area in Scotland. Add to this the fact that the profitability of egg pro-duction as carried on in Aberdeen and Banff (where it was particularly important) has declined and the inevitability of considerable amalgamation seems clear if incomes areto be maintained.

34. Elsewhere, prospects are better. Although the outlook for cash root crops in the region are unpromising and some difficulties have been encountered in seed potatoproduction, there is every prospect of a further expansion in cereals and in small fruit and vegetable production, especially if new lines now being tried are successful.35. What does this picture mean for the future? Economic advantages would accrue from a reduction in the number of farms and an increase in their average size in mostparts of the region. But the need is keenest in Aberdeenshire and Banffshire. an improved level of income per person in agriculture could also be brought about thereby a reduction in the number of workers employed. The rural population density is sufficiently great to allow this, for a time at any rate, without serious social consequences.This will depend upon gradually developing from among the present large number ofsmall urban centres throughout the area a sufficient number of more modern and substantial ones to match town employment to the reduction in the rural population.36. In the Dundee Area the decline in the number of workers is likely to slow up, asmechanisation has already reached quite an advanced stage. This is probably also true of Moray and Nairn. In Aberdeenshire and Bantfshire the number of workers perholding is already low. Nevertheless labour economies should be possible in livestockenterprises especially if there is a move out of fodder roots with their high labourrequirement; and it is here that farm numbers are most in need of reduction.37. The present number employed full-time in agriculture is about 32,000 persons(11,200 farmers and 20,400 workers). The reduction in this number in the next tenyears might be tentatively estimated at 6 to 7,000 for the region as a whole, of which about 4,500 might be in Aberdeen and the north and 2,000 in Perth and Angus.Agricultural Ancillaries38. A wide range of ancillary industries and services are to be found in the burghsthroughout the region which act as market and servicing centres for their agriculturalhinterlands. The processing of farm products is widespread. Fruit and vegetablecanning and processing is carried on in the southern part, at Dundee, Blairgowrie,Forfar, Carnoustie and Montrose, making use of locally grown produce from theVale of Strathmore and the Carse of Gowrie; and at Fochabers in Moray. Whiskydistillation is of considerable importance, particularly in the north along Speysidewhere about forty of the sixty distilleries in the North-East are to be found; some use is made of locally grown barley, although much is now imported from elsewhere.Milk processing is not widely represented but as some dairying is carried on in thevicinity of the towns there are creameries and other small milk processing units inElgin, Nairn, Peterhead and Aberdeen. Grain milling takes place at most of the largerregional centres. Other agricultural processing industries include poultry processing atCoupar Angus and Aberdeen and the large bacon factory at Dyce. Some local woo! isstill used in the textile industries.39. The main auction markets for livestock are at Aberdeen and Perth but many ofthe smaller centres such as Turriff, Elgin and Forfar also have them. Slaughterhousesare to be found in most of the larger regional centres including Aberdeen, Perth,Dundee, Forfar, Fraserburgh and Peterhead. Grain and seed merchants are widelyscattered but potato merchants tend to be concentrated in or near Strathmore and thehinterland of Aberdeen where seed potato cultivation is important. Agriculturalengineers operate mainly in Stonehaven, Aberdeen, Huntly, Turriff, Forfar and Forrcs.Animal feeding stuffs and fertilisers are manufactured on a small scale at Aberdeen,Peterhead and Carnoustie.40. It is a function of development in the agricultural industry generally that asnumbers directly employed fall and as productivity increases, employment also rises in agricultural ancillaries and services. This is as true of the North-East as anywhere;indeed with the strong representation of the food processing industries the regionhas done rather well. But this does not mean the total employment necessarily balances

out in any particular area or that the distribution of employment is not changing.Many of the smaller ancillary services are no longer performed locally, and the manu-facture of the ever more complicated agricultural machinery now in use often takes place outside Scotland altogether and its servicing is centred on a few of the largertowns. This means that agriculture is less than ever able to support a self-sustainingrural economy, and one cannot look to ancillaries alone to provide the backbone ofemployment in even the major country towns.Forestry41. The current rate of planting by the Commission is 8,200 acres per annum-6,000 in the upland &quot;fringe&quot; and 2,200 in the lowlands. Private estates in the regionpractice forestry on a large scale and make a very useful contribution to the employ-ment and population of the rural districts. At present they are planting at the rate ofabout 3,500 acres annually. It is hoped that both private estates and the forestry commission will be able to continue planting at the current rate but it must be pointedout that much of the plantable land comprises the best grouse moors in the countryand very little has come into the market in recent years.42. At the beginning of 1965 the number of industrial workers directly employedin the Forestry Commission^ woods was 950 and although no exact numbers areavailable for private estates the comparable figure was about 120. In addition to those employed directly on timber production it may be assumed that a further 200 300 areemployed in local timber using industries.Fishing43. Fishing with its processing and other ancillaries is a basic industry in many small towns along the north coast from Peterhead to Lossiemouth, in Aberdeen itself and at a few points south of it. Manpower requirements in the industry are graduallydeclining. Fewer and more powerful boats call for a smaller labour force, and makedecisions necessary about which of the many harbours and settlements should be selected for further development. Those most suitable for continued use seem likely toinclude Arbroath, Peterhead, Fraserburgh, Macduff, Buckie and Lossiemouth, and above all Aberdeen.44. Other problems concern the future of subsidies and loans and the questionwhether Government policy will continue to aim at financial viability in the industry for vessels over 80 ft. in length by 1972. In this and in other respects it is important to distinguish between the in-shore section of the industry along the Moray Firth coast(and from Arbroath to Stonchaven), and the trawling section in Aberdeen. The first,relatively heavily subsidised on weight offish landed, is also relatively prosperous, andwill be protected in some measure by extension of our fishing limits. It employs two-thirds of the total labour force of 6,800 and is a mainstay of many small communities.The trawling section at Aberdeen on the other hand is faced with problems of over-fishing, low prices, competition with English deep water and &quot;freezer&apos; trawlers and lossof some prolific traditional fishing grounds by extension of foreign limits. It employsdirectly only some 2,000 people, although there are some ancillary functions in Aber-deen, particularly in marketing and processing, which serve the fishing industrythroughout the region.45. Clearly, fishing even with its ancillaries is not to be looked to as a growingsource of employment. The real question is the speed at which it will decline, and the ways in which, if at all, decline should be retarded, especially along the north coast.The present scale of operation is being largely maintained by Government subsidies,and it is perhaps a matter for regret that the pattern of the industry seems, in Aberdeenat least, where there is a relatively large number of somewhat small firms, to be cutting

the city out of the chance of developing along the lines which look most likely to be successful in the Humber. Despite its advantageous geographical position in relationto the distant fishing grounds, Aberdeen is not yet equipped with the kind of cold storage facilities which make the use of &quot;freezer&apos; trawlers possible out of the port. Noris the multiplicity of small processing and merchanting firms likely to fit in with the trend towards highly advertised, branded and packaged food sold through self-servicedisplays and supermarkets. And meanwhile the traditional advantage of quality whichthe Aberdeen middle-distance product enjoyed over distant caught fish when the humber catch was merely iced on board, not frozen, may soon be eroded.Manufacturing Industry46. Within the manufacturing sector, in addition to the relatively high proportionof food and drink industries, North-East Scotland has its largest single group more than twice the Scottish proportion of textile industries. These two, and the paperprinting and publishing group account for about 60 per cent of the North-East&apos;smanufacturing e uployees. On the other hand it has a smaller share of the metal basedindustries:Manufacttiring Industries Employees 1964	North-Bist Region		Scotland	Nos.	0/ /o	/oFood, Drink	20,000	20	13Textiles       ....	29.000	29	14Metal Industries	32,000	32	45(Orders IV-IX)			Paper. Printing and Publishing	10,000	10	8All other Manufacturing	9,000	9	20All Manufacturing	.    100,000	100	10047. Manufacturing industry in the North-East generally is thus rather narrowlybased, especially when account is taken of the fact that within the textile group thejute and flax processing industries occupy about 75 per cent of the 29,000 in textiles.48. During the 1950s, the region failed to maintain its level of manufacturing employ-ment: allowing for changes in the standard industrial classification there was a drop ofabout 6,000 between 1951 and 1959. Since 1959 there has been an encouraging recoverybut in mid-1964 the number of employees in employment was still about 2,000 below the1951 level.49. After a period of post-war buoyancy, a severe recession took place in the 1950swhich particularly affected the traditional jute and linen industries. Since then the expanding sectors have been able to take a strong hold and the jute industry has re-covered some of the lost ground. The main expansion in the numbers has come in thefood and drink, engineering and electrical and printing and publishing industries. most other sectors, notably shipbuilding and marine engineering, have either declined orremained weakly represented.50. Although over the period both the main areas shared in the decline in manu-facturing employment, the Dundee Area has come rather better out of the period thanthe Aberdeen Area. In the Dundee Area considerable employment losses in the Tiftiesdue largely to contraction in the traditional textile industries have been largely offsetsince 1959 by expansion in a more diversified range of industries many of them new tothe area. By contrast the Aberdeen Area, apart from the northern coastal belt, has attracted only a small share of new expanding manufacturing industry and the periodhas been one of slow decline in manufacturing employment up to 1959 and of stabilitywithout overall growth since.

51. A slightly surprising and encouraging feature is that, despite the high rate of netmigration, male employment in manufacturing industry more than maintained its position between 1951 and 1964; an increase of 6 per cent in the Dundee Area was accompanied by a decrease of 5 per cent in the Aberdeen Area which was more exposed to migration losses. In contrast the number of females in manufacturing fell by S percent but this took place almost entirely in Dundee, the more vulnerable textile area,whereas employment for women and girls in the Aberdeen Area showed little change.52. Another little known feature is that manufacturing employment in the north-east coast group (Buckie to Peterhead and hinterland) rose by 20 per cent from 1951to 1964. This was mainly due to the fact that two important concerns concentratedtheir fish processing activities in Fraserburgh and to the growth of engineering there and in Peterhead.53. The most important contrast of all and one which confirms the rather sluggishoverall picture of the Aberdeen Area so far presented, concerns new development.Aberdeen has gained little new and diversifying industry throughout the period. Butlike the Peterhead and Fraserburgh corner Dundee has had a great deal. Firms intro-duced to Dundee after the war increased their employment by over 10,000 between1951 and 1964.54. Three other parts of the region require some separate comment. First, the coastal area from Lossiemouth to Banff, and its hinterland centred on Elgin, Keith,Huntly and Turriff. This is not primarily a manufacturing area. Only one-sixth of itsemployees are in manufacturing firms. The main manufacturing activities are the food and whisky industries, textiles in Elgin and Keith, boat-building and repairing in the coastal towns, and sawmilling. There has nevertheless been a useful expansion in the manufacturing sector. The main increase has come from the growth of food processingat Fochabers and from increased employment in whisky distilling. But the other sectors have also undergone a modest expansion. Very little new industry has come intothis area since the war. the main example being the A.E.I. electrical factory at Buckie.One of the main problems is that population is very scattered and no one place can atpresent provide a substantial manufacturing labour force.55. Secondly, the Strathmore towns, including Arbroath and Carnoustie, provideanother reasonably distinct group within the region. Although within travelling distance of Dundee, these towns Blairgowrie, Forfar, Brechin, Montrose and the two already mentioned have their own distinct economic life and problems. Their main problem inrecent years has been the decline in textile employment consequent upon the contractionof the jute and linen industry. More than 500 jobs have been lost in this way since 1951.Nevertheless there has been a useful infusion of new industry, with the result that the manufacturing labour force has increased slightly. The numbers employed in the foodindustries have grown, and there has also been some increase in engineering, notably in Arbroath, where impressive developments in machine tool manufacture have takenplace and a food can factory has also been established. During this period the jutefirms themselves have become less dependent on the more vulnerable jute products andthey have managed to achieve a modest measure of diversification. Except in Blairgowrie,the numbers of females in manufacture have fallen throughout the area, most heavilyin Brechin, but in all the towns there has been more employment for males. As a result,the employment structure of the towns has become rather more balanced betweenmales and females.56. Thirdly, there arc Forres, Nairn, Granlown-on-Spey, Banchory, Crieff andPitlochry the areas which join North-East Scotland to the Highland counties. Heremanufacturing industry is of very small importance, more than two-thirds of employeesdepending for their livelihood on the service sector of the economy and more than a quarter being engaged in agriculture. Only about 5 per cent of the labour force under1,000 people is engaged in manufactures and the total amount of manufacturingemployment, as well as the total labour force in all activities, has fallen since 1951.

The principal forms of production are sawmilling and whisky distilling, hut while thewhisky sector has been prosperous and has increased its employment, there has been noparallel expansion in the remaining manufacturing industries.FOOD AND DRINK INDUSTRIES57. The food and drink industries have provided one of the two main blocks of increased employment in the region; nearly four thousand more people have foundwork in them since 1951, an encouraging alliance with the natural resources of thearea.58. The Aberdeen Area has accounted for two-thirds of the increase, owing to thevigour of a few large concerns such as those at Fochabers, Dyce, and at Fraserburghwhere employment has also become less seasonal.59. The Scotch whisky industry has achieved a spectacular expansion in output and exports. Because of its concentration on malt whisky distilling and the absence ofthe larger-employing grain distilleries, and because there is little blending and bottlingin the area outside Perth (only one malt distillery in the area bottles its own product),the industry in North-East Scotland contains less than 3,000 employees out of about15,000 engaged in distilling, blending and bottling in Scotland. About two-thirds are inover 60 malt distilleries (the largest of which employs not many more than 40 people),mostly in Banffshire and Moray.60. Nevertheless there has been a most useful increase in employment of about1,000 in the North-East industry since 1951, the greater part having been in the numer-ous small distilleries. Employment in the manufacturing side of the industry has grown more sharply in Central Scotland, because of the proportionately largeruse of grain whisky in blends; and in the Highlands and Islands since the setting upof the large grain distillery at Invergordon. Additional employment in the North-Eastindustry has had three other benefits; it has been very largely for males, it has become less seasonal, and it has helped the more rural parts. New developments have con-sisted of the setting up of several additional small malt distilleries and the large-scalemodernisation and expansion of blending and bottling facilities in Perth.61. Current new projects in the whisky industry (that is, new projects now building up their labour force and those still to recruit) arc likely to provide an additional 1,500jobs, but only 150 of these are likely to be in the North-East. Upper Banffshire is stillcollecting most of the projects. In addition a new mechanised malting is being built atBurghead. Makings of this type are tending to replace less economic smaller makingsat individual malt distilleries and provide easier disposal of effluent on the seaboard.THE METAL-BASED INDUSTRIES62. The metal-based industries in North-East Scotland, that is to say foundries,shipbuilding, mechanical and a little electrical engineering, and metal goods, employabout 29,000 people. This amounts to more than a quarter of all those in manufactures.But significantly over two-thirds are in the Dundee area. Very little metal itself is produced from the few foundries in Dundee, Perth, Arbroath, Montrose, Aberdeenand Elgin, and so the northern area is thus at some disadvantage in having longinward hauls for its raw materials.63. The main branches of the metal-based industries (proceeding from the olderto the newer) are founding, shipbuilding and marine engineering, pneumatic engineer-ing, mechanical handling, electrical engineering, office machinery, timepieces andrefrigeration. Indeed, the metal-based sector is probably better looked at as a rather

miscellaneous group of individual firms of whom about a dozen employ two-thirds ofthe labour force.64. Between 1951 and 1964 the whole group increased its total employment by over2,000 or about 10 per cent. The great bulk of this increase was in the Dundee area and followed the introduction of new engineering industries such as National CashRegister and Timex to Dundee. Closures, in common with the whole North-Eastpattern, were heavier in the earlier part of the period. Nearly 3,000 jobs were lost inthis way up to 1959, whereas the decline from this cause has been modest since about to 4 per cent of the number employed in that year.65. Over the period the number in shipbuilding and marine engineering fell by about1,500 and the number in iron foundries and the other small metal-producing industriesrose a little. A rather unexpected feature was the acquisition by the north-east coastdistrict, chiefly in Peterhead, of some vigorous new engineering firms which broughtabout an increase in employment in the metal-based sector in this district of nearly1,000 persons, over two-thirds male. There is also a notably efficient railway workshopat fnverurie with 600 workers, for which a long-term future is planned by british railways Board.66. The general picture for the metal-based industries in the region has therefore been a reasonably stable level of employment in the older-established engineeringgroup, a heavy decline in numbers in the shipbuilding and marine engineering portion,and a sharp increase in the newer firms, mainly in Dundee but also in Peterhead.TEXTILES67. Now overtaken by the metal-based group, the textile industries were formerlythe largest employing group in the North-East manufacturing sector. In 1951 they gaveemployment to 33,000 people, about 7,000 more than in metals. But by 1964 thenumber had dropped to 28,000 while metals had increased to 29,000. This has been themain structural change in manufacturing employment in the region.68. The main textile industries are jute all in the Dundee Area with about 16,000and flax with about 4,000, over three-quarters of which is in the Dundee Area.69. The jute industry-defined to include made-up goods consists of about 80separate establishments employing about 14,000 people in Dundee and about 3,000in the smaller Angus towns. In the last ten years, employment in the industry has fallen by nearly 3,000, mainly in Dundee. There has thus been little decline in the otherAngus towns. The fall in numbers has been wholly among females; the number ofmales increased slightly.70. The broad structure of the jute industry has not altered a great deal in the past ten years. There has been a tendency to concentrate on more specialised lines. Modern-isation and a modest amount of rationalisation have taken place, and efficiency has considerably increased which is one reason for the decline in the labour force.Despite some liberalisation in recent years, the jute industry in Dundee (spinning,weaving, finishing and making-up) remains protected by special arrangements covering a range of competing imports from India and Pakistan. The industry now suppliesabout two-thirds of the home market, and has limited opportunities for expandingexports in the face of competition from the sizeable industries of India and pakistan and those which arc growing in some other developing countries. It still employsbetween 17,000 and 18,000 people so its future is important to the area. The latestchanges in the import arrangements, which are maintained in the interests of employ-ment in Dundee, were made in the autumn of 1964 and are due for review in 1967.71. In the event, the reduced protection has been temporarily offset by the recentimport surcharge and conditions at home and abroad have sustained employment in

the industry to an extent that it has actually been experiencing some labour shortagefrom the competition of other expanding industries. It is at present intended that theprotection arrangements for the industry will be reviewed in 1967.72. Employment in the flax industry has fluctuated a good deal in the last decade.There was a sharp fall in employment in the late &quot;fifties when the textile industries bothnationally and internationally were depressed. The years since have seen a rise, fall,and recently yet another rise in the numbers employed. But the long-term trend, as aresult both of greater efficiency and competition, has been for the labour force in theindustry to fall. In 1964 about 4,000 were employed, a drop of about 20 per cent since1955, mainly in female employment. The industry in the Aberdeen Area mainlycomprises one vertically integrated firm whose employment, like that of the industry as a whole, has fluctuated over the period but it is only a little less now than ten yearsago. The decline in the industry*s labour force has therefore been almost wholly in theDundee Area.73. The remaining textile industries are principally knitwear and carpets and bothhave increased their employment Dundee is a modestly growing centre of carpetproduction.74. The total employment picture for textiles in the study area is therefore a decline of about 5,000, mainly in female employment comprising a fall in jute and llax associated -ated industries of about 6,000, and an increase of around 1,000 in other textile indus-tries. The net decline in the group and also the incidence of closures have been verylargely in the Dundee Area.PAPER, PRINTING, PUBLISHING, ETC.75. The remaining significant group of industries in North-East Scotland includes the production of paper and board together with printing, publishing and book-binding. This group employs about 10,000 people, rather less than half in paper and board. The group has expanded its employment fairly steadily since 1951 by almost a quarter in paper and board and by 15 per cent in the rest of the sector. The AberdeenArea now contains almost the whole of the paper and board industry in North-EaslScotland and the number employed has risen by over 800. The Dundee Area has recentlylost its main paper concern at Invergowrie. However, it contains much the largestportion of the printing and publishing industry with several large and important units in Dundee itself; and it has benefited from two sizeable local newspaper concerns.The rest of the printing and publishing industry has enjoyed an expanding market, andhas been little affected by closures.BUILDING MATERIALS AND WOOD PROCESSING76. The mineral extraction industries are only meagrely represented, a handicapfor a more distant area. Only about 700 people arc employed, mostly on workingroadstone. Until recent years granite quarrying was important in the Aberdeen Area-one of the two traditional sources for Scottish granite- but the local processingindustry now depends on co-operative shiploads of Scandinavian granite which isdenser, more consistent, and obtainable in larger pieces which can be fashioned more cheaply. By dint of local enterprise the Aberdeen processing industry has re-establishedbuilding granite as a modern facing material: the use of memorial granite is continuing to decline.77. Production of building materials is also poorly represented. Bricks, commonand facing, slates, cement, glass, builders&apos; ironmongery and most of the timber haveto be brought in, as do the more modern materials and fittings. Granite bricks made from chips have been developed in Aberdeen but the area is not a large consumer offacing granite which is mostly used in office buildings in the south or large institutional

buildings in the main centres. Production of manufacturers&apos; joinery is being established in Stonehaven by an Aberdeen firm.78. Altogether these industries employ only about 2,500 people. The labour force has grown by about 5 per cent since 1951 but has fluctuated considerably. Most of the units have remained small; returns made in 1964 for 60 establishments (employing11 or more persons) showed only 13 employing over 50 persons and only 4 of thesebetween 50 and 100. The growth of employment achieved in recent years appears tohave had no special industrial characteristic, a gradual increase in employment overmost firms. But all of it has occurred in the northern portion of the area. As in the area as a whole closures of firms were heavier in the first half of the period: indeed noclosures have been recorded since 1957.79. The wood processing industries-sawmilling, builders joinery, wooden buildings,containers, furniture, etc. occupy about 4,000 people in the study area fairly evenlydivided between the northern and southern portions. Outside Dundee and Aberdeenthe industry is largely confined to sawmilling. Nowhere is it carried on on a large scale; the main units, which tend to be larger on the fabricating side, employ only between 100 and 200. Between 1951 and 1959, employment fell sharply and the smallerdistricts contiguous to the Highlands were particularly affected by the closing ofsawmilling establishments; in all between i95! and 1960 about 20 establishmentsclosed down in North-East Scotland with the loss of about 1,000 jobs. The main reasonsseem to have been the reduced demand for wooden pitprops and the greater selectivityof consumers when imported timber became more freely available.MANUFACTURING PROSPECTS80. Despite its more distant location manufacturing employment in the AberdeenArea, at least since 1959, has managed to maintain a reasonably stable level. It is thuspossible to take a moderately optimistic view, as a whole, of the prospects for establishedmanufacturing enterprise. Discussion with 20 or so of the main manufacturing firms inthe Aberdeen, Pcterhead and Fraserburgh areas recently has tended to sustain thisview, though the shipyards are facing fierce competition in common with the rest ofthe country&apos;s shipbuilding industry, now the subject of a special Government review.81. Looking at the main sectors of established manufacture in the Aberdeen Area,and taking into account their employment history since 1951 and what is known of future prospects in the next 5-10 years, a moderate growth might be hoped for,mainly in food processing and paper, printing and publishing. But these alone couldnot provide a big enough dynamic to invigorate the area. This can only come if existingfirms show much greater readiness to move into new fields, and if new enterprises canbe attracted.82. Turning to the Dundee Area, the basic change in the employed manufacturinglabour force was a small net loss between 1951 and 1964. This represents about 5 percent more males but 10 per cent less females, a situation reflecting the reduction in thedemand for women in the older textile industries, accompanied by the introduction ofnewer industries more weighted towards male employment. This situation was reflectednot only in Dundee but the other Angus towns. Perth, however, did not receive new industry to any marked extent and its manufacturing structure has therefore tended to weaken. Generally, manufacturing industry has been improving its balance betweenmale and female employment.83. Since 1951 the predominating feature of new development has been the successof Dundee in attracting projects carrying about 8,500 new jobs. About 1,500 morehave gone to other places in the area.84. The major growth has taken place in the newer industries of electrical andelectronics engineering and the manufacture of office machinery and watches andclocks. These gains did much to offset losses in the traditional textile and shipbuilding industries.

85. The major influence on future employment in the area for some years is bound tocontinue to lie in the balance which emerges between the numbers in the expandingnew industries and in the main industries which have been declining over a period,notably jute and flax.86. The future position in shipbuilding is uncertain more than a very few years ahead because there is only one shipyard and its prospects naturally depend on itscompetitive position in an industry which now faces a period of considerable re-organisation. The decline in the textile machinery industry has been halted since the closure of one large firm in Dundee in the late &quot;fifties. There should be good prospects for the other firms for a considerable period in equipping the developing countries.87. Jute apart, the potentially declining elements in the Dundee Area do not appearto be likely to give any cause for serious concern considering the buoyant element it also contains. Both the newer industries and strong established industries such asprinting and publishing, have considerable scope for further enlargement. One of themore interesting features of the healthily evolving new structure of industry in the area is its increasing stake in the expanding carpet industry. Already a substantial proportionof the output of the jute industry is supplied to carpet makers and there is a growingproduction of wool and mixed fibre carpets. The building materials industry has alsobetter scope for growth here than in the Aberdeen Area.88. Some account must also be taken of the likely rate of expansion of the newerindustries. About half of this employment arises from several large concerns whichhave now built up to a considerable size. Not many completely new industries have come into the area recently. It would be reasonable to expect, therefore-and thistends to be confirmed by knowledge of the prospects of individual firms that the rateof expansion of the newer industries already there might be rather less in the next five to ten years than in the past ten to fifteen. In fact, the rate of expansion did moderateslightly in the second half of the period from 1951 to 1964; about 6,000 jobs accruedup to 1958 and under 5,000 up to 1964.89. While it is not possible to attempt to make any detailed forward budget of gainsand losses in manufacturing employment for the Dundee Area over the next five to tenyears, the view taken in the study is that the expanding elements in the manufacturingeconomy should be able comfortably to overtake likely decline other than from anyspecial problem which may arise in respect of the jute industry. A severe contraction inthe jute industry could affect the Strathmore towns, but moderate changes would not present serious problems; the jute firms outside Dundee have been engaging in somediversification and there is also a leavening of new industries which are increasing theemployment opportunities for males.Tourism90. The wide variety of scenery, wealth of historical associations, ease of access andcomparatively dry, sunny climate have established many parts of the North-East aspopular holiday areas. In 1963 there were l-33m. visitors (including the parts ofSouth-West Perthshire and Kinross outside the study area). This was over a quarter ofthe Scottish total.Visitors, 1963NairnMoray  .BanfT    .AberdeenshireKincardineAngus   .Perth and KinrossApprox.

Aberdeen and Perthshire accounted for three-quarters of the visitors. In relation to total population and, in employment, Perth and Kinross and Nairn emerge as the mostactive tourist counties.91. There are two main tourist areas the coast and the mountains. The coastalresorts, from Carnoustie to Nairn, have traditionally catered for families staying for aweek or more. They have a listed capacity of over 6,000 beds a night in hotels andboarding houses, though the actual figure is believed to be well in excess of this. the mountains and valleys to the west have accommodation for more than 6,500 visitorsa night. The remainder of the total listed capacity of 16,100 beds a night is scatteredthroughout the low land areas. It is not known to what extent all this capacity is taken up, but field work at Grantown-on-Spey and on Deeside shows that severe pressureoccurs during the peak summer holiday months.92. The coastal resorts all compete in the same market principally Central Scotland with those of Fife, East Lothian and the Clyde. At a time when traditional resortsare suffering a decline the initiative of local authorities and tourist associations inpublicity, standards and facilities is of great importance. &quot;Second holidays&apos; and conferences offer possible lines of development.93. The Grampian Highlands on the other hand are not duplicated anywhere elsein the British Isles. They have a far larger market than the coastal areas of the North-East and it is expanding. This subject is also examined in the Highlands and Islandsstudy.Problems and Prospects94. One encouraging point that emerges from most of the available employment and population records for the North-East region as a whole is that the usual trend from1951 to 195S was one of decline, especially in the Aberdeen Area, but that from 1959to 1964 there has been something like stability.95. The twin problems of heavy outward migration and fairly high unemploymentmainly affect the Aberdeen Area. They are both related to the rapid run-down in man-power in agriculture, fishing and transport, and to the very restricted number and range of other employment opportunities within travel-to-work distance. The negligiblegrowth of new manufacturing in Aberdeen is a special problem. Inward and outwardmigration have balanced sufficiently to give the city a relatively static population, and unemployment has never been high.96. There is notable scope for development in food processing, in tourism, and inthe highland and coastal areas, in chemical or other industries with special watersupply and effluent disposal requirements.97. While there is a diverse range of industry it is too dependent upon the fortunesof individual enterprises for any reliable labour budget to be worked out for all thesectors and sub-regions of the North-Easfs economy. In general the prospect of amaintenance or modest improvement in the total amount of manufacturing employ-ment is more likely than a decline. But an infusion from time to time of some new industry is a feature of most healthily developing areas. This is overdue in Aberdeenat the very least as an insurance against the future but more importantly to assist instemming net emigration.98. In the Dundee Area the jute industry contains some large firms, but thefortunes of this area are, on the whole, less dependent on the prospects of individual firms and more on the course of events in the jute industry as such which in the longer term seems bound to continue to be a declining source of employment. The growth ofemployment in the area will hinge essentially upon the rate at which new industriescan be matched to this decline and to the numbers available who would otherwisemigrate. The main focus for expansion seems bound to remain Dundee itself with itsdeveloped facilities, substantial labour force and its ability to draw on nearby com-munities conveniently as well as offer them services on a city scale.

99. Finally, on the evidence of past and present performance, some conclusions canbe reached about towns which offer the best scope for future development. about half the 50 towns in the region may be regarded as significant centres of local population from a development point of view. These are burghs with over 3,000 population (or8,000 including their immediate hinterlands) located about every 15 miles along trunk roads and railways and possessing an essential minimum of key services, professions,amenities and, mainly north of Aberdeen, still having an appreciable natural increase.Of these, besides the two cities, the most suitable for development specially when the size of existing or potential labour catchment is considered appear in the south to bePerth, Arbroath, Forfar, Montrose; and in the north. Peterhead. Fraserbugh. BanffMacduff, Buckie, Elgin and Keith. The northern towns are demographically sounderand offer better prospects of providing a continuing source of labour from their ownpopulation resources than do those in the south, which, as Part II has suggested, might require the injection of new population to meet any sustained labour demand.

The Highlands and IslandsPart ITHE STUDY AREA1. The Highlands and Islands for the purposes of the study were taken to be the sevencrofting counties of Zetland. Orkney, Caithness, Sutherland, Ross and Cromarty,Inverness and Argyll. These have together a resident population of 276,000. Hut certaincontiguous areas, with a population of 65,000, have also been taken into account.They comprise, in North-East Scotland, north and west Perthshire and the upland partsof Angus, Aberdeenshire, Banffshire, Moray and Nairn; this means the Grampiansas a whole come within the study. And the county of Bute, which is generally regardedas part of Central Scotland, also requires consideration in association with ArgylPsHighlands-in-the-Clyde.2. It must be recognised at the outset that the Highlands and Islands are as a wholequite unlike any other part of the United Kingdom. They make up about a fifth of thetotal land mass, contain a large number of inhabited islands- and inhabited mainlandpeninsulas more inaccessible than islands and stretch for over 400 miles from thenorth of Shetland to the Mull of Kintyre, which is south of Alnwick. For transport,education, public services generally- this sheer physical extent of inhabited countrypresents a difference of degree so great as to constitute a difference of kind.3. When this has been said, however, it must also be recognised that the Highlandimage most popularly held, which tends to reflect the crofting fringe of the economy,is a misleading one. Only one-fifth of the population live on crofts, while two-fifthsare in the rest of the countryside and another two-fifths live in urban settlements ofover 1,000 persons. The largest of these notably in the [nverness-Dingwall-Inver-gordon area and Wick-Thurso-are set in conditions which apart from their outlyingposition differ little from many parts of Lowland Scotland.4. The region is in fact split into three distinct economies. The first and mostimportant is the fairly urbanised, central, and quasi lowland area around the Beaulyand Cromarty Firths, which extends in a narrowing belt of orthodox lowland-typefarming up the east coast and reappears in Caithness and Orkney. The second is theEastern and Southern Highlands, an area of upland farming, a growing tourist and recreation industry, and small service towns, which is within a few hours of central scotland by train or ear. Finally there is the western and northern periphery, includingthe Hebrides and Shetland, which contains though even this is not wholly dominated by the crofting economy. Remote as most of this area is by land and sea the numerousplaces served by air are within an hour or so of Glasgow or Aberdeen.5. Rising standards of living have made the provision of acceptable services for themore scattered parts of the population a difficult problem, and have led inevitably tothe concentration of facilities in the more populous centres for certain medical and educational purposes, even in Aberdeen and Glasgow. It is on the character andpotentialities of the main centres and the labour catchment areas on which theydraw that the study concentrates for the purpose of examining the employmentpossibilities of the region. For the servicing of these main centres and of smallersettlements the North of Scotland Flydro-Electric Board has provided a network andsource of domestic and industrial supply they would not otherwise have had; and theirgreat dependence on good communications whether by road, rail, sea or air is manifest.

Part IIPOPULATION6. Past history and present geography make population problems particularlyrelevant in Highland development. This Part outlines the trends of migration anddepopulation and compares them with those of other regions of Scotland. It alsoindicates the very different ways in which change is affecting the population level and structure of a variety of dispersed settlements, and examines tendencies towardsconcentration, the extent of declining and of stable areas and the impact of new sources of employment. Finally the demographic basis for future regeneration is discussed.7. The seven Highland counties occupy some 47 per cent of the land area of Scotlandbut have a population of only 276,000 or 5 per cent of Scotland&apos;s total (with thecontiguous areas 62 per cent and 341,000. or 7 per cent). The average density of the seven counties is only 20 persons per square mile compared with 97 in other ruralregions and 910 in Central Scotland. Sixty per cent of the population is rural. settlement is largely confined by mountain, moorland and sea to parts of the coasts, the islands and the eastern straths. This scatter and isolation of communities accentuates theirdependence on declining primary employment, and their generally ageing and fallingnumbers. This is the basic Highland problem. Naturally most acute in the predominantly-nantly rural and outlying West and North zone where crofting prevails, it is mitigatedin the more accessible central and southern Highlands where there are several impor-tant concentrations of both urban and rural population, notably from Inverness toInvergordon and at Fort William and Oban. There are also outlying concentrationsat Thurso-Wick and Stornoway in Lewis. These and other smaller nodal points offer the most likely basis for further development.Net change and Migration8. The population of the Highland counties has been falling for a century andemigration has continued for a very much longer period. In 1911 the resident popula-tion was 341,500 and it fell in the following two decades by over 51,000 as a result of heavy emigration. Between 1931 and 1951 emigration was at a very much reduced rate(during the depression and war years) with the result that the population fell by lessthan 4,000. Since 1951, however, net emigration has been resumed, though at a lower rate than in the period up to 1931, and the Census population has fallen by over8,000 in 10 years. The following table gives a comparison of changes in Total Popu-lation&apos; in the Highlands and the rest of Scotland between 1951 and 1961.	Total Population		Changes 1951-61						(June) 1951        1961 (Thousands)		Net Change No.      %		Natural Increase No.      %		Net Migration No.        %	Seven Highland Counties Other outer regions Central Scotland	290 0 1,132-6 3,746-4	279-7 1,112 1 3,834-2	-10 3 -20-5 4-87-8	-3-6 -1-8 4-2-3	4   7-1 -i- 56-3 4-275-7	42-4 -1 50 -17-4	- 17-4 - 76-8 -187-9	- 60 -6-8 -5 scotland	5,1690	5,226-1 1  4-57 0		4-1-1	-f 339-1	16-6	-282-1	-5-59. It will be seen that the distinctive feature of the Highlands was the low rate of natural increase, not the rate of loss by migration which, was about the same as

ii.tin the rest of Scotland in this period, while the rate of net fall in population wasdouble the average of other rural regions. About half the net outward migration more than in the other regions was to the rest of Scotland, mainly the Central belt.The scale of net movement out of the Highland Counties (1,750 a year in 1951-61and 1,400 in 1961-64) is, like the total population, not particularly great in relationto the figures for Scotland as a whole. But the effects of emigration on small, scatteredHighland communities with little or no natural increase are greater than elsewhere.Gross movements both out of and into the Highlands are at relatively high rates,apparently confirming the tradition of temporary emigration by Highlanders andIslanders and temporary immigration by. for example, construction workers.10. The impression given by these average changes in the Highlands population in1951-61 must, however, be modified on closer inspection. In fact they are made upof an increase of 4,700 in the Census population in Caithness County and 1,700 inInverness Large Burgh the former including a net gain of 3,(XX) migrants arisingfrom the Dounreay development- and a decrease in all other Counties and all thecontiguous areas which together contain S4 per cent of the regions&apos; population-amounting to 23,000 or 7-2 per cent, double the average rate for the 7 Counties.Natural Increase11. Similarly, for natural increase, the rates in Caithness and Inverness Burgh were7 per cent, as high as in Central Scotland; but in the rest of the Highlands only averaged1 per cent, almost as little as in the Borders. The low crude birth rates and high crudedeath rates in most of the Highlands are due to the low proportion of younger marriedpeople and high proportion of older people in the population, itself a result of prolongedemigration of the reproductive age groups. They are not due, as they are in parts of the borders, to low fertility of marriage, which is indeed at a rate 10 per cent above theScottish average; or to ill-health, for the standardised death rate is in fact 14 per centbelow the Scottish average. It is also reassuring that the average rate of natural increasein 1951-61 was the highest in any decade since before 1911 and it has risen furhcrsince 1961. This appears to be due partly to higher marriage rates at younger ages andto lower mortality, as in Scotland generally recently; and partly to the immediate gain in fertility from the retention, or inward migration, of younger working age groups in developing areas, notably in Caithness and some of the towns.12. A continuation and wider extension of this process could bring stability to many parts of the Highlands. The rates of marriage fertility are in fact above the Scottishaverage in five of the Highland Counties and in Orkney and Sutherland arc only slightly below. Looking at individual areas, fertility would appear to be relativelyhigher in South LJist and Stornoway, Oban and North Lorn, Fort William, Aird andInverness district, Dingwall and Muir-of-Ord and the Wick/Thurso area. In some areas there is a shortage of younger men (as in Dunoon, Tiree and Coll, and Barra)and in some areas a shortage of younger women (as in Mull, Harris, North Uist andLewis).Age Structure13. Compared with Scotland as a whole the Highlands have a relative surplusof persons over the age of 65 and of the older working age groups, and a relativedeficiency of persons in the younger working age groups and of children under 15,though the latter sector is still comparatively large considering the long-term effects ofemigration. The existing age structure is more favourable than that of the BorderCounties which has the features of a less viable population than that of the Highlands.The following table sets the age structure of the Highland Counties&apos; population inperspective.

(Ross and Cromarty)	17-7	27-1	32-4	22-814. Within the Highlands there is a considerable range of conditions, Caithnessrepresenting the positive end of the scale and Argyll the negative. Caithness^ high proportion of children under 15 and younger working age groups has given it ayounger population than the Scottish population, while ArgylPs relative deficiency ofthese age groups and preponderance of older working age groups and persons of retire-ment age, has given it a population considerably older than that of Scotland as a whole.The figures for Lochcarron illustrate the extreme of this condition where personsover 65 actually exceed the number of children under 15 by a considerable margin.Other areas with a low proportion of persons of younger working ages include Dunoon,Mull, Tiree and Coll, Barra, Harris and North Uist, Cromarty, Lewis, almost all ofSutherland, and most of Orkney and Zetland. Those with relatively high or evenaverage proportions of younger working age populations include South Lorn, Inver-ness, Fort William, Aird and Lochaber, Dingwall and Avoch, Lerwick and most areasin Caithness. Areas with favourable proportions of children under 15, include FortWilliam, Aird, Barra, Lochaber and South Uist, Stornoway and Tain, Dingwall,Fortrose and lnvergordon, the Golspie area and the north of Caithness. Such areasmay be regarded as relatively sound demographically.Declining Areas and Stable Areas15. Between 1951 and 1961 over three-quarters of the parishes in the seven Countiesdecreased in population, the majority by between 10 and 50 per cent. This was appar-ently the result of low natural increase, or decrease, and moderate or heavy loss bymigration. Decreases were most prevalent in the West and North, both in croftingareas and in farming areas like Orkney; and nearly all parishes and a majority ofburghs in the East and South Grampians and Bute decreased. Broadly this was a continuation of the earlier trend of 1911-31 and 1931-51, but there arc now signs ofa slowing up in decline in some crofting areas of Wester Ross and North-WestSutherland.16. Although there is a prevailing pattern of depopulation and an overall regionaldecrease, some internal re-distribution of population is taking place. A quarter of theparishes (including burghs) increased or were virtually static in 1951-61 and they now contain as many as 140,000 people, half the total of the seven counties. the stability of the burghs, and probably the other areas, is known to be due to moderateor high rates of natural increase and a small net gain or moderate loss by migration.Some of the people leaving the farms and crofts-the proportion is not known arcbeing held in these Highland towns.17. These &quot;holding areas&apos; most of which were also growing or at least static in1911-31 or 1931-51 and in 1961-64 are concentrated along what may be called thecentral axis of the Highland mainland from Cowal and mid-Argyll in the south-westthrough Lochaber and the Great Glen north-eastwards to Inverness, Easter Ross,East Sutherland and most of Caithness. It is in this relatively accessible zone that bothurban growth, based on services, industry and tourism, and forestry development havebeen mainly concentrated in the past 40 years. Hydro-electric constructional work has

played a temporary part. The most striking examples of expansion are in Lochaberand Caithness, associated with the introduction of non-indigenous industrial employ-ment, and in Inverness Burgh, the regional &quot;capital&quot;, associated mainly with thegrowth of services.18. The effect of industrialisation of a crofting area is seen in the changing populationof part of Lochaber:1911       1931       1951       1961Kilmallie and Kilmonivaig parishes .      .       5,348     7,361     9.268    10,132The first large-scale industrial development in the Highlands was carried out here bythe British Aluminium Co. and its subsidiaries, who set up power plants and factoriesat Foyers in 1893, at Kinlochleven in 1909 and Fort William in 1933. Entirely new town-ships were built to house immigrant workers from the Lowlands, and from other partsof the Highlands. The environs of Fort William including several outlying villages, have greatly expanded. The number of workers there has been tending to fall.19. The striking increase of nearly a quarter in the population of Caithness and therejuvenation of its age structure since 1951 has occurred mainly in and around ThursoBurgh, which increased from 3,200 in 1951 to 9,200 in 1964. It has been transformedby the setting up of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority^ breeder-reactorstation at Dounreay in 1955-59. Over half of the permanent staff are immigrants,including scientists transferred from the U.K.A.E.A.&apos;s establishments in Englandwho have been housed in Thurso. Educational and other services have been greatlyexpanded. Formerly Caithness County was dependent almost entirely on farming,fishing and crofting and it had a long history of unemployment, outward migration anddepopulation.20. The few cases of increase or stability of population which have occurred in moreoutlying parishes in the West and North appear to be due to a variety of circum-stances. These include urbanisation (in and around Lerwick, Kirkwall, Stornoway andPortree): continuing afforestation (in South-West Ross, Glenelg and Morvern);tourism (in parts of Badenoch and possibly Loch Broom); the communal stability and up-to-date methods of some small fishing or crofting communities (for example in Shetland); and the establishment of Services bases (in South Uist and Unst). Butfor weaving, the fall in population in crofting townships in Lewis would have been much greater.Future Prospects21. The impact of these past economic developments has increased the widediversity which clearly exists in the demographic structure and potential futureof local populations. These differences will have to be closely examined from statistical information and local surveys before the relative opportunities for development in one district or another become apparent. At one extreme there are districts, oftenisolated, where people are thin on the ground and elderly at that, and where for this and other reasons there is little prospect of a self-generating community. other districts have a less unfavourable demographic future but may have one adversecharacteristic, such as a shortage of marriageable young women. But there are manytowns and rural townships, mainly in the S.W.-N.E. axis of the mainland but also inLewis and in the Northern Islands, where the numbers, ages and fertility of the popula-tion are likely to provide a sound demographic basis for development. A projectionof the population for 1961-81 suggests that to ensure the total population of the regionfalling very little if at all it would be necessary for new jobs to arise at about the ratethey have done since Dounreay began. This would not be easy as Dounreay itself was an unusual form of labour demand but if it is to be brought about at all it would seem necessary to concentrate on planning for a limited number of centres with the bestprospects for accommodating and sustaining new developments.

Part IIIINDUSTRY AND EMPLOYMENTStructure22. Analysis of the industrial structure in the Highlands on the basis of employeesis particularly difficult because of the relatively large numbers of self-employed,notably in agriculture and textiles. In the following table for the 7 Highland Counties,the first column is derived from the 1961 (10 per cent) Census. The remaining columnsgive the Ministry of Labours estimates of employees at 1961 and 1964 and a com-parison with Scotland as a whole.	Working population 1961 0/ /O	1961 No.	Employees 1964 %       No.		0/ /o	Scotland 1964 0/ /OPrimary Industries (Agriculture)	20-9 (14-5)	12,000 (8.000)	15 (9)	12,000 (8,000)	14 (9)	7 (3)Manufacturing Industries	90	8,000	10	9,000	10	34Services (Construction)	70-1 (11-9)	61,000 (14,000)	75 (17)	65,000 (13,000)	76 (15)	59 (9)Total                           % No.	100 106,500	82,000	100	86,000	100	10023. The distinctive features of the economy arc thus the heavy dependence ondeclining agricultural employment, the very small representation of manufacturesand the large and growing service sector. The first two accounted for less than a thirdof the working population in 1961 lower than in any other study area and servicesmore than two-thirds higher than elsewhere.24. An average proportion of only 10 per cent in manufactures, compared with about one-third in Scotland as a whole, is a striking index of the Highland problem.Only two employment exchange areas have more than 15 percent of their employees in manufacturing Fort William in Lochaber, centre of the aluminium smeltingindustry and Stornoway in Lewis, centre of the tweed industry; there is also a zone of smaller manufactures from Inverness to Invergordon. However, these and certain otherexceptions are of some significance for the future in a Highlands context.25. The abnormally high services sector includes a large but fluctuating construction industry, most of the U.K. A.E.A. development at Dounreay (in Professional and scientific Services) and tourist services such as Hotels and Catering which includespart-time and seasonal workers. There remains a larger internal servicing componentthan in any other study area, the nearest to it being the South-West which is also anoutlying and rather self-contained area.THE MAIN SECTORSNatural Resources and Land Use26. The Highlands are endowed with substantial resources of hill land, much of itsuitable for stock grazing and timber growing; with spacious mountain and coastalscenery for recreation and tourism; water power, industrial water supplies and deep-water harbours; sea and river fisheries. Among the mineral deposits are dolomite,

limestone, shell-sand, silica, potash-bearing shales (whose investigation has beenGovernment assisted), lead and zinc, serpentine and talc: but their economic exploita-tion in all but a few cases has not been possible owing to inaccessibility or limitedoccurrence and the easy availability of bulk supplies of equal or higher quality fromabroad.27. The land use aspects of economic development in the Highlands are particularly important because of the virtual absence of other sources of economic production over large parts of the area. The seven Highland Counties extend to nearly 9 million acres of 14,100 sq. miles (47 per cent of the land surface of Scotland) and the wholegeographical region including the contiguous uplands of the North-East and Buteextends to 18,600 sq. miles (62 per cent of the land of Scotland or 21 per cent of britain). Of the 9 million acres, 8 j million are taken up with agriculture (only 7 percent under tillage and grass and the remainder rough grazings). Deer forests total2-1 million acres (overlapping with agricultural use) and rather less than half a million acres are taken up for forestry. The main land use problems are the need to rationalisethe crofting pattern which has too many very small uneconomic units; the allocation of land for the forestry programme, which can take place without appreciable dctri-ment to agriculture: the under-use of much of the deer forest land which is capableof fuller development for agriculture and forestry: the improvement and control of access to the open spaces for recreation and tourism; and the orderly and attractivedevelopment of land for urban uses for which ample space can usually be foundmainly by expansion of certain existing centres.Agriculture28. Agriculture produces a gross output valued at about  20 million a year (approxi-mately 11 per cent of Scotland&apos;s gross output) of which some three-quarters comes from 4,600 full-time farms and one-quarter from some 20,000 crofts. The pattern ofagricultural land use reflects the limiting effects of soil and climate as well as thesparseness of the population, and the crops grown are mainly for feeding livestock.Sheep are strikingly important and the Highlands make a large contribution to Scot-Iand*s output of wool, sheep and lambs. Most of the full-time farms, which form thebackbone of the agricultural economy, are devoted primarily to breeding and rearingof livestock and commercial farms are concentrating to an increasing extent on sheep and cattle rearing. The more intensive forms of enterprise such as milk, pig and eggproduction have been declining, while sheep and particularly cattle have been incrcas-ing. Crofting agriculture generally provides only a small supplementary cash income from sales of stock, plus some milk, eggs and potatoes for domestic use.29. The demand for beef and probably lamb is likely to increase by at least as muchas for food generally, and these and other possible developments in livestock pro-duction could benefit the Highlands if farming there can be competitive in production costs with similar stock rearing farms elsewhere. This in turn will depend on exploitingthe area&apos;s basic resources of a relatively plentiful supply of hill land and of labour bythe use of new techniques of production. Moreover, the growing tourist trade provides a seasonal increase in demand for foods such as milk, eggs, potatoes and vegetableswhich could be met by local farmers and crofters if they compete in price and costwith imported supplies. To provide an adequate living, some increase in farm sizeswill be necessary.30. Farming at present provides full-time employment for some 7,700 farm workerstogether with 4,600 farmers and part-time employment for about 2,000 workers andpossibly 16,000 crofters. Making some allowance for crofters, whose strictly agri-cultural employment is difficult to assess, farming probably accounts for the equivalent of about 17,000 full-time jobs, or about 16 per cent of the working population, in the decade to 1962 the number of regular full-time workers fell by 23 per cent, the same

limestone, shell-sand, silica, potash-bearing shales (whose investigation has beenGovernment assisted), lead and zinc, serpentine and talc; but their economic exploita-tion in all but a few cases has not been possible owing to inaccessibility or limitedoccurrence and the easy availability of bulk supplies of equal or higher quality fromabroad.27.

Farming at present provides full-time employment for some 7,700 farm workerstogether with 4,600 farmers and part-time employment for about 2,000 workers andpossibly 16,000 crofters. Making some allowance for crofters, whose strictly agri-cultural employment is difficult to assess, farming probably accounts for the equivalent of about 17,000 full-time jobs, or about 16 per cent of the working population. In the decade to 1962 the number of regular full-time workers fell by 23 per cent, the same

rate as in Scotland as a whole, and it is estimated that employment in this sector willcontinue to fall, if rather more slowly. Numbers of full-time workers and farmers may therefore be estimated to decline from 12,300 at present to about 11,000 in ten years&apos;time: similarly part-time employees from 2,200 to about 1,500. If crofting were to be reorganised in units providing full-time employment for one man. not more than,000 crofter-farmers would be needed compared with possibly 16,000 partly engagedin agriculture at present. In fact reorganisation on this scale is very unlikely to beachieved for a long time.Croiting31. On the 20,000 crofts there are estimated to be some 16,000 crofter households,forming about 15 to 18 per cent of the working population, in the seven Counties. an estimated population of 60,000 or 22 per cent of the Highlands population is dispersedin some 700 townships in the main crofting districts along the western and northernseaboard, the Outer Hebrides, Skye and Shetland. Analysis of the diversity of thecrofting economy is only possible by field studies, and this account draws on work inrecent years by the Crofters&apos; Commission, and by Glasgow and Aberdeen Universities,which includes surveys of four different outlying districts.32. As an economic activity crofting is partly agricultural, contributing about one-quarter of the gross output of the Highlands, but mainly a many-sided means oflivelihood based on all available local resources and sources of income, whether part-time or virtually whole-time. This is because the original pattern of very small, un-economic croft holdings still largely persists, and only in exceptional areas, suchas Westray in Orkney, has reorganisation produced what are really small farmsand a more advanced agriculture. Usually less than 20 per cent of crofters and their families are supported by full-time croft work. The remainder either have ancillaryoccupations in local public services, shops, hotels, trades, farms, fishing and forestry;work away from home for all or part of the year (for example, in the merchant navy and on hydro-electric and road works); or are unemployed or under-employed.It is a case of outside employment with ancillary crofting agriculture more often thanagriculture with ancillary sources of income. Nevertheless, the labour provided offthe land in these ways is particularly valuable in the Highlands context. It is the onlylabour available for many small tourist catering and essential service activities and for much forestry development in a widely dispersed population, and it makes a con-tribution in industrial and urban centres such as Fort William, Stornoway and, on a smaller scale, Brora.33. In the four districts recently surveyed estimates were made, with the assistanceof several Departments&apos; records for 1963/64, of three categories of earnings: (1) fromprimary production (sales of livestock, fish, knitwear, etc.); (2) remuneration of doctors, teachers and other public servants (including from temporary public works)and of those with jobs temporarily outside the area; and (3) welfare benefits (chieflyunemployment, national assistance and pensions). The following table shows that the share of these &quot;external earnings&apos; varies considerably from one district to another,but that, except in Westray, category (1) is about equalled or exceeded by (2) and (3)taken together. The table also shows that these earnings amounted to an average per capita for the year of between  150 in North Uist and  231 in Westray (or  500 and 730 per household). No comparable figures are available for other areas or in the sameyears, but except in Westray these figures are probably below the Highlands average(Inland Revenue figures of taxed income for 1959,60 gave an average of  180 per capita in the Highlands,  242 in Scotland and  309 in England).34. The main trend in the adaptation of the crofting structure is that crofts aretending, slowly, to be amalgamated. On current trends and policies, the number ofcrofts and the number of croft holders may be expected to fall by only about 2,000 by

If action were taken by stronger powers and inducements to accelerate this trend towards more viable units, it is doubtful if the reduction in units and holders wouldbe greater than another 1,000. The traditional regard for the croft holding and houseas a secure and cheap base of operations is deeply implanted, especially in areas likeLewis where considerable non-crofting income is possible and where social cohesion is strong in relatively large townships. Most crofters still prefer a variety of expedients inemployment and income, in order to remain at or based on their homes. In any casemany smaller townships would no longer have sufficient numbers of active people for community life in relative isolation if they were cut down to a purely rational agri-cultural level.35. It seems clear that crofting will continue as the main economic activity inthe north and west Highlands and Islands. And despite its frequent gross inefficiencyviewed purely in modern agricultural terms it has a value in providing a tolerablysatisfying life for people in remote places, whose services are useful to the community in other ways services which could not be easily or cheaply replaced if the croftingpopulation were to disappear. But croft holdings must be enlarged and agriculturaltechniques improved if adequate opportunities are to exist for the young. Townshipscan with advantage be fostered where labour for other purposes is likely to be needednearby, especially for forestry and tourist development; and where the numbers of people of working and reproductive age are likely to be sufficient to maintain stability.Fishing36. Inshore and off-shore sea fisheries are a considerable resource available -not ofcourse exclusively so-to the Highlands and Islands. Though a traditional adjunctto the crofting economy, there has been a marked decline in the participation of localmen in the industry. The number of part-time crofter fishermen fell from 4,000 in 1938to about 900 in 1964; they operate mainly in the Outer Hebrides, Shetland, Orkneyand Skyc. Whole-time fishermen using sizable modern motor vessels have maintainedgreater stability of numbers since the war. They number at present some 2,200 and operate mainly from Campbeltown, Tarbert, Mallaig, Wick and several centres inShetland and the Outer Hebrides, including Stornoway and district where nine full-time fishing vessels were provided between 1961 and 1963 under the Outer HebridesTraining Schemes. However, most of the fish landed on the north-west coast, at Kin-lochbervie, Lochinver, Ullapool and Gairloch as well as at Oban, arc from vesselsregistered elsewhere chiefly on the east coast there being very few resident fishermenat these ports. Schemes of assistance to the fishing industry apply in the Highlands asin the rest of Scotland. These provide for financial assistance by way of grant and loan for building new fishing boats and for a limited range of improvements to fishing vessels. An operating subsidy is paid to vessels engaged in fishing for herring and white

fish, but it is intended that this should be gradually reduced and eventually eliminated.The fishing ports of the Highlands have been built and developed mainly with smalland medium-sized vessels in mind. They do not provide facilities for the larger modernvessels which in Scotland work from Aberdeen. Processing facilities in the form ofquick-freezing and cold storage plants, reduction factories, and shellfish processing,exist at a number of Highland fishing centres but are often handicapped by irregularsupplies.37. Certain modest improvements in employment and income are not impossible in certain favoured places, particularly in shell fishing; and in the longer term fishfarming and associated processing may bring employment. But for the purposes ofthis study it would be quite wrong to imagine that fishing can be looked to as a signi-ficantly expanding sector of the Highland economy.Forestry38. The extent of managed woodlands in the Highland counties (400,000 acres) is less than that of tillage and enclosed grass on crofts and farms (600,000 acres) andamounts to only 4-5 per cent of the land surface; it gives employment to 2,900 forestworkers, contractors, haulage workers and men in sawmills, etc., about 3 per cent ofthe Highlands labour force. In the greater Highlands, including the fringe uplands ofthe southern and eastern Grampians, the Forestry Commission have planted 358,000acres and private owners 272,000 acres and this gives similar employment to about ,500.39. Wherever planting has been on a large scale as in mid-Argyll, west Perthshireand south-west Ross, and in crofting areas where local surveys have been made, ithas been found to have a notable effect in diversifying focal employment, in concentrat-ing the thin spread of habitation and in retarding or halting rural depopulation witha consequent maintenance of viable communities. Much greater regional effects in termsof basic industry are also now beginning through the setting up of the Annat pulp and paper mills which will employ 1,200 by the early seventies. With some further expansion in the eighties this will lead to more than a doubling of the urban population aroundFort William, as well as stabilising or increasing many smaller communities in the extraction areas. State ownership of land in districts of high scenic and recreationalvalue, such as Glenmore National Forest Park in the Cairngorms, has contributed to substantial developments in tourism; while afforestation in upland areas has a signifi-cant role in providing shelter for livestock and conservation of soil.Manufacturing40. Manufacturing industry, which is unrelated to indigenous primary products, ispoorly represented in the Highlands and Islands. Distance from the main markets and the lack of skilled labour and managerial enterprise still present obstacles to substantial development. In 1964 only 9,000 persons were employed in manufacturing about 1-4 per cent of the number employed in manufacturing in Scotland as awhole. Only one-tenth of the total employees in the region were employed in manu-facturing compared with just over one-third in Scotland as a whole and more than two-thirds of these jobs were in industries based on indigenous primary products.41. The manufacturing industry that does exist is mainly represented in a few towns,including centres of communication, though in most of them it is narrowly based.Three-quarters of the employment in manufactures is in 7 out of the 18 employment exchange areas and in only six of the eighteen are more than 10 per cent of the employees in manufacturing. Stornoway and Lcrvvick rely heavily on textiles and food processing,Dingwall/Invergordon on whisky and timber and Campbeltown on whisky and cloth-

ing. Fort William and Thurso are heavily dependent on single industries (aluminiumand atomic energy) for which special location factors apply. Only Inverness Employ-ment Exchange Area with its concentration of population and communications astride the region exhibits a reasonably broadly based industrial structure, including engineering and electrical goods, printing and publishing and metal manufacture as well as primarybased manufacturing industries. The Inverness area in fact provides one-fifth of allmanufacturing jobs in the region.42. Of the four principal Industrial Orders in the region, three are closely associatedwith primary industries-food and drink which provide more than a quarter of thetotal jobs in manufacturing, textiles (about a fifth) and timber products (about aneighth). Just over half the employment in food and drink is provided by whisky whichhas its main strongholds in Speyside. the eastern seaboard (Dingwall, Invergordon,Inverness) and the islands of Islay and Skye; about a quarter of the labour force is employed in meat and fish processing, particularly in Shetland, Lewis and Thurso.Over 60 per cent of the employment in textiles is in the Hebridean tweed industry, but even so crofter weavers of whom there are about 1,500 are excluded from these employ-men t figures because they are self-employed. Tweed is also produced in Oban and theInverness area. In addition the small but important Shetland knitwear industrypro\ides substantial employment for self-employed knitters who are not included inthese figures. Timber using industries are concentrated in the eastern part of the regionaround Inverness, Dingwall and Invergordon and in the contiguous areas. Otherindustries of lesser importance but of significance in local areas are boat building in coastal fishing towns, building materials in Inverness and seaweed processing in theOban area and the Uists.43. Among the industries unrelated to local primary industry, metal manufacture isthe most important providing about an eighth of all manufacturing jobs, almost entirely in the aluminium industry at Fort William and Kinlochleven. Engineering and electricalgoods follow closely with just over a tenth of manufacturing jobs; much of this isancillary to the nuclear project at Thurso and most of the remainder is in the Inverness/Dingwall area. Other industries are small in scale but often important in the localeconomy. These include printing and publishing in Inverness and Oban, clothingmanufacture in Campbeltown, Dunoon and Rothesay, glass in Wick and pottery inDunoon, most of which have come into the area since 1945.Change in Manufacturing Employment44. Allowing for changes in the standard industrial classification in 1959 the numberof employees in employment in manufacturing industry rose slightly over the decade1954-64 in the seven Highland Counties and fell appreciably in the contiguous areas.There were considerable fluctuations in individual industries.45. The fastest growth in indigenous industries was in whisky, in which the expansionat Invergordon played a major part, and in tweed; the manufacture of building materialsincreased in a number of places, chiefly in the Inverness area; and there was a marginalincrease in chemicals the seaweed industry. These increases were offset by a large-scale loss of about 1,000 jobs in timber which was widespread but most marked in thecontiguous areas but this fall is exaggerated by the fact that the timber labour force was greatly expanded in 1954 to clear wind-blown timber. Leather, rope and net andknitwear declined marginally. Marginal decreases in food processing in a number of areas were largely offset by increases in fish processing in Shetland and Orkney. Themain expansion in non-indigenous industry was in engineering and electrical goods,due mainly to development at Dounreay but there was also some growth aroundInverness. Glass at Wick, printing at Inverness and pottery at Dunoon also increased their employment. On the other hand, there were fewer jobs in metal manufacture(mainly aluminium) and some contraction in clothing manufacture despite development at Campbeltown, Dunoon and Rothesay.

46. Although most employment exchange areas showed a loss of manufacturingemployment over the decade, there were marked improvements in a few, includingThurso, Stornoway and Dingwall/lnvcrgordon. There were marginal increases atLerwick and Campbeltovvn. Decline was most marked in Fort William and in thecontiguous areas of Forres/Nalm, Grantown-on-Spey and Banchory which sufferedmost from the contraction in the timber industry. Inverness, the most importantmanufacturing area in the region suffered only a marginal fall in manufacturing employ-ment as growth in engineering and electrical goods, printing and building materialscompensated for losses in timber and fruit and vegetable processing. In some of thesmaller manufacturing areas the establishment of new small-scale industries helped to mitigate losses from indigenous manufacturing industries: the glass industry in Wick,atginate processing at Oban and paper and clothing manufacture at Dunoon.47. New industries are therefore few, and the range of indigenous industries narrow.Some, like tweed and whisky, continue to show a healthy vitality; others like timberand pulp, have yet to demonstrate their full potential. The pulp mill at Fort Williamwill undoubtedly provide a substantial measure of employment, but even so, this is unlikely to be sufficient to offset the loss of jobs in primary industry. The growth ofother manufacturing industry, except for the unique development at Dounreay, hasbeen disappointing.48. It would seem that Development District status has not so far been a sufficientinducement to attract new types of industry into the region except in the relativelyattractive environs of Inverness and adjacent east coast areas. This can be illustrated by an examination of manufacturing firms employing more than ten people in 1964,which have been established in the area since 1945. Of the forty-six employingsome 2,700 people which have been established since the war, only fifteen, employingbetween them about i,100 persons, were in non-indigenous industries. Most of these new jobs stemmed from nuclear development at Thurso, from the growth of enginecr-ing, electrical and printing industries at Inverness and the location of clothing factoriesat Campbeltown, Dunoon and Rothesay. Nearly half of the 1,500 post-war jobs inindigenous industry were in food and drink, mainly whisky in Invergordon and fishprocessing in the Islands; one-fifth were in timber manufactures in the InvernessInvergordon area; one-sixth in building materials, mainly in the Inverness area, andone-tenth in Flarris tweed.49. Nevertheless, the total of 2,700 jobs created in all post-war manufacturingdevelopments made up more than a third of the 7,600 jobs in all existing employmentin firms of ten or more. The most favoured area for these developments was theInverness/Dingwall/lnvergordon area which attracted fifteen firms employing nearly1,000 people or two-fifths of all the post-war jobs. The contiguous areas were leastfavoured with only five firms, employing 80 people or 3 per cent of post-war jobs.50. Of 850 small firms (under 20 skilled workers) known to the Scottish CountryIndustries Development Trust in the Highlands, about 400 have been started since1945. These are mainly in such consumer goods industries as foodstuffs, knitwear andcrafts. The number and range of new enterprises has been most evident in Ross-shire andShetland. No distinction is drawn in this report between big and small industries in general, not enough is yet known about the numbers and special needs of the latter.But a strengthening of the present scatter of small firms, mainly of services types at local nodal points of population, is necessary. These small industries tend to crop upmore often in the Highlands and more people have ideas for setting them up becauseof the lack of alternative employment. They require improved assessment and assistancein the initial stages, especially because such small and personal enterprises can be veryvulnerable.Finance and Industrial Development51. Interest in financial facilities offered by the Local Employment Acts has undoubtedly been at a high level since 1960. There have been approaches in respect of

about 250 projects though a fairly high proportion have not proceeded to the point offirm application. Almost 90 were in respect of manufacturing processes; with few exceptions the remainder were in respect of service industries, hotels and catering beingthe largest category (about a quarter of all expressions of interest).52. In only a small number of cases, however, could it be said that the financialfacilities have been instrumental in attracting new industry into the Highlands and islands from outside. Indeed, since the war the number of projects of this characterhave been fairly few, with or without financial assistance. The principal examplesapart from the pulp and paper mill and the Dounreay establishment, are factoriesengaged in printing and making solenoids on the Board of Trade estate in Inverness, aparticle board factory also in Inverness, and a clothing factory in Campbeltown. Ina dozen or so other projects there has been expansion of established activities by outside interests, for example in seaweed and whisky, fish and other sea food processing.Again excluding the pulp mill and Dounreay, the total employment afforded by new industrial projects imported into the Highoands in this way in the last twenty yearsprobably amounts to under 1,000 jobs.53. While the prospects are good for the staple manufactures in the highlands and Islands, based on local resources or long-established skill, chiefly in textiles,whisky and wood processing, the attraction of further new industries from outside is bound to remain a matter of perseverance in the face of the many competing locationsfor industry in other parts of the country.54. In the long run, the Highlands resources of labour, sites, water supplies, anddeep-water harbours could attract special industries. Moreover, firms with high-value-to-weight products and managerial ability should succeed. The Government havealready taken steps to improve the prospects of the Highlands and Islands achieving the development of new enterprises by persons and organisations both from inside andfrom outside the area. In particular the Highlands and Islands Development board will be able to provide some supplementary financial assistance and to step up advisoryservices on management and accountancy to small businesses in the area.Dounreay55. The Wick/Thurso area is of considerable interest in the context of employmentin the Highlands because it illustrates the effects of an introduction of a modernhighly sophisticated industry into an essentially non-industrial community remotefrom the main centres of population.56. The population increase of 4,700 in Caithness County between 1951 and 1961included, as already mentioned in Part II, a net gain of 3,000 due to the establishmentof the Atomic Reactor Station at Dounrcay in 1954. This comprised many in the younger working age groups with a high proportion of children. To meet the rcquirc-ments of this large influx of population some 2,000 houses have been provided along with additional educational facilities. The rejuvenation of population particularly inthe Thurso area has been particularly remarkable, as has the welcome move away from dependence on the hitherto traditional but now declining agriculture and fishingindustries.57. While the development of reactors is the main function of the ExperimentalReactor Establishment, it is used for experiments in support of other reactor systemswhich are likely to assure full utilisation of the fast reactor for the rest of its operatinglife. In addition, the Authority are concentrating at Dounrcay the development and manufacture of fuel elements for all their materials testing and research reactors.Experiments have now reached the stage where the Authority are ready to construct a prototype power station of about 250 MW capacity, and the decision on the siting of this station will be of considerable importance to the economy of the Highlands.The time for decision has not been reached, as the Authority have not yet submittedtheir proposals to the Government, but technical factors affecting the choice of the

site have been under consideration by the Authority itself, the Scottish electricity boards and other Government Departments. The Government have made it clearthat they are very conscious of the importance of the Dounreay establishment to thewhole of the life of the Thurso area, and have promised that this will be very much inmind when the decision is eventually made. In addition, it has been confirmed that,regardless of the ultimate conclusion on the siting of the prototype fast reactor, thereis sufficient work on hand at Dounreay to keep it occupied for the next seven or eight years, which is as far ahead as current research programmes make it possible to see.Despite this forecast it is crucial to the economy of this particular part of the Highlandsthat in the longer term the employment opportunities and the other services and amenities of the area are maintained. Here it is important to realise that even if the prototype fast reactor does come to Dounreay the current level and character ofemployment afforded by the Establishment will not last for ever (if it does not comethe run down and change of character will, of course, occur fairly quickly). This means that the uniquely attractive and lively social environment at present in Caithnessshould not be wasted, but used-with the supply of labour the Establishment itselfhelps to produce and which cannot be absorbed locally to diversify employmentbefore it is too late.Tourism58. A review of economic data on the Scottish tourist industry suggests that an estimated 2-34 million holiday-makers from Britain spent holidays in Scotland in 1964,and it is thought that between a quarter and a third of these visited the Highlands.No estimate can be made of the number of foreign visitors to the Highlands on thebasis of existing data.59. To accommodate the visitors there was a listed nightly capacity of 29,300 beds in hotels, boarding houses, and holiday centres and youth hostels. This figure does not represent total accommodation capacity as rented houses, and many bed and breakfastpremises are not included. There has been an increase of 3 per cent or 900 beds inlisted accommodation since 1961, mainly in boarding houses: over the whole ofScotland the increase was nearly 10 per cent, and the Highland counties share of thenightly capacity has fallen by 2 per cent. On the basis of available data it is not possibleto say with any degree of accuracy what demand there is for available beds during the peak season. It is believed to be intense especially in the west, but it is also believed to vary from area to area. For instance, during a week in August, 1964, the occupancy ofhotel beds on Speyside was nearly 90 per cent and in Deeside 78 per cent.60. According to road census figures for trunk and A class roads in the Highlandsthe number of passenger vehicles doubled on average for comparable summer weeks in 1958 and 1964. Part of this rise can be accounted for by a rapid growth of local carownership, though this was from a small base figure. The value of petrol sales for the summer six months north of the Caledonian Canal was almost double that of thewinter six months in the 1960-64 period. Between 1961 and 1964 the number ofextended bus tours in Scotland by English and Welsh operators went up by over 56per cent. A large proportion of these included the Highlands in their itinerary. Togetherwith the increase in cars has been a rise in the number of caravan and camping sites.In the crofting counties the number of listed sites has gone up from 134 in 1961 to223 in 1964. This takes no account of unlisted sites provided by crofters and farmers and unofficial facilities by roadside verges and lay-bys which are quite widely used inthe most popular tourist areas.61. The number of employees in employment in hotels and catering in the employ-ment exchange areas of the seven counties was about 7,000 in 1964, or rather less than10 percent of total employees in employment: these include part-time and some of the summer immigrant workers. Comparisons cannot accurately be made with years priorto 1959, but since then there has been a rise of about 20 per cent in hotel and catering

employment (this general trend obscures seasonal fluctuations). Figures for theindividual areas show that some are heavily dependent on tourism as a source ofemployment. In Portree, Dunoon, Oban, Crieff and Pitlochry the numbers engaged inhotels and catering were between 15 and 20 per cent of all employees. In general, the lowest percentages are in the far north. These statistics exclude the bed and breakfastbusiness almost entirely, and if this is taken into consideration the tourist industry as a source of at least part-time employment is even more important.62. In January 1965 the number of wholly unemployed in hotels and cateringin the crofting counties was 895. In June it had fallen to 166. Some seasonal variation in unemployment is likely to continue to be a feature of the tourist industry, althoughthe more general staggering of holidays might help to reduce it. During the season thereis intense pressure on the supply of labour. Indeed, in terms of unfilled vacancies thereis believed to be insufficient labour to meet demands in the Highlands at the seasonalpeak and Lowland labour has to be engaged. There is particularly heavy demand forwomen for the less skilled occupations.63. Expenditure on hotel, restaurant and boarding house facilities, as estimated bylocal planning authorities, his lisen from  168,000 in 1960 61 to  229,000 in 1962 63and  1-47 million in 1964/65. Over these five years total investment was  3-66million. Of this  2-63 million was invested in Inverness County (nearly  2 million inthe Aviemore area), followed by Inverness Burgh ( 360,000), Argyll ( 260,000) andRoss and Cromarty ( 1S9.000). In the remaining areas of the Highlands investmentover the five-year period was nowhere greater than  63,000. Expressed in value per head of population (1961) the investment for the period ranged from  49 in InvernessCounty to 5s. in Zetland.64. While it is extremely difficult to estimate the earnings of the tourist industry,several attempts have been made to do so by surveys in specific localities. The followingtable based on them indicates some of the wide variations between different com-munities (of 1,000-3,000 population):Estimates of earnings from tourist accommodation and hoard(per head of population per summer season, 1963 or 1964) Strathpeffer and Contin.....180Grantown-on-Spey   ......     60Gairloch ........    50Lochalsh/Kintail/Glenshiel       ....    20North Uist.......4In North Uist it is known that these earnings amounted to about 8 per cent of those from agriculture and other primary production and 3 per cent of the island&apos;s estimated total earnings; and the number of people heavily dependent on tourism 27 amountedto only 4 per cent of the total working population. But this is one of the least developedareas, and earnings from tourist sources other than accommodation and board arenot included. It seems clear that the tourist industry is already making a substantial contribution to the local economy in the other areas quoted.65. There can be little doubt that the Highlands will have an increase in tourist traffic in the next few years. Travel by arterial routes and services to and from the highlands is tolerable save for the growing inadequacy of the main road approaches,and apart from some questions of internal access the limiting factors in the expansionof the trade are likely to be the shortage of labour and inadequate amount of accommo-dation. Especially in the longer established holiday areas where there is little or noslack to be taken up in the form of existing accommodation, new hotel constructionis essential. There may be prospects of spreading demand by lengthening the seasonin some new areas which can offer ski-ing facilities in the winter and by offeringreduced hotel and transport rates in the better weather of May, June and September.In the north-west and Outer Isles the development of tourist accommodation bycrofters offers some scope through the extension of houses and provision of chalets,

which can be assisted by Government loan. There is need for more caravan and camp-ing sites along the main tourist routes. An improvement in information services fortourists is also required. The provision of facilities other than accommodation suchas car parks, lay-bys, footpaths and nature trails will be covered in the proposals fortourist development now being put forward by local authorities. These should go someway towards fulfilling the need for further research on the tourist industry and com-compilation of basic statistics, both social and economic, local and general. The Govern-ment has recently announced a grant of  75,000 over three years to the ScottishTourist Board for research purposes.66. Because of the heavy seasonal fluctuations it would be unsound for the High-lands to become too heavily dependent on tourism as a source of employment. A morebalanced employment force and less purely seasonal hotel work in the hotel and catcr-ing industry might be conducive to an increase in the numbers employed. But in the short term the best prospects of expansion of facilities for tourism would be in theextension of those facilities making the most economical use of labour.Unemployment67. Unemployment in the Highlands and Islands (some 5,000 males ami 1,300females) tends to run at a rate of 7-8 per cent, about twice that of Scotland. Us mostdistinctive features are its somewhat seasonal character and its dispersal in smallpockets. Over the decade 1952-62 the seasonal rise in the adult wholly unemployedfigure between July and January has averaged 81-1 per cent compared with 35-1 percent in Scotland as a whole. The rise in the figure for wholly unemployed women in the highlands and Islands is even more noticeable, averaging 160-4 per cent over the decade, and comparing with a 64-9 per cent average rise in the wholly unemployedfigure for men. The high winter peak is most marked in building and contracting(males) and hotels and catering (women). This high seasonal fluctuation indicates theneed to increase the relative proportion of employment in the productive sector ascompared with services.68. It is most unlikely that as low a level of unemployment could be achieved in the highlands as might be attainable within the Central Belt of Scotland. The sparsely populated nature of much of the area, the distribution of unemployment and parti-cularly its concentration in certain Islands, and the lack of versatility in an industrialsense among the older unemployed, are bound to cause some degree of unemploy-ment due to immobility. There are also some statistical reasons not fully explored which also tend to put the rate at a higher level than might otherwise be expected.Thus a realistic attainable annual average rate for the Highlands might be between3 and 4 per cent. It has been argued that in any case unemployment in the Highlandsis not so economically oppressive as in the industrial areas where unemployed areunable to resort to crofting or other rural pursuits to supplement the family income.69. The areas in which manufacturing industry is already established on a moderatescale (Inverness-Dingwall-Invergordon area, Fort William, Thurso-Wiek and Storno-way) have a considerable labour pool on which to draw, even if it is largely unskilled.And Fort William, which has a somewhat smaller hinterland, enjoys a reasonableaccessibility from the Clydesidc conurbation denied to the other areas. Although short of industrial skills and relatively remote geographically, these areas appear to havepotential for further industrial growth. A Departmental study recently made of seventeen firms in manufacturing industry which have established themselves in the highlands and Islands in the post war period shows that these have been built up without any serious labour supply difficulties, and in fact all but four have been ableto obtain their skilled labour requirements within the Highlands and Islands. With one exception labour turnover has been low and firms are satisfied with the quality of their labour. As is so often the case in Scotland some difficulties have in the past been experienced in housing incoming workers, but key workers as a rule have been housedfairly quickly.

Potential for Consolidation70. As many as twenty-two towns and villages in the Highlands and tour in the con-tiguous areas can be defined as centres of travel-to-work areas, in which the labour supply is or would be sufficient to support modern industrial and/or commercialLabour Catchment AreasArea or Group of Areas		1961	Unemployed	(A as Actual: P ^ potential)		Population		-			Julv 1964	January 1964Invergordon/Evanton/Dingwall	A	64.700	670	1,153Inverness	P	80.800	774 : ; :	1.355Stornoway	A	14.600	487	639	P	21,100	817	1.127Wick/Thurso	A	27,000	566	915	P	28,000	574	931Lerwick/Scalloway	A	9,000	130	367	P	12.400	192	543Golspie/Brora/Lairg	A	5.400	102	224	P	12.000	120	267Grantown/Aviemore/Kingussie	A	8,400	49	88	P	12.600	1 10	190Campbeltown	A	10,000	270	310	P	11,500	300	340Dunoon	A	13,000	71    ,	188	P	14.100	77	203Kirkwall/Stromness	A	1 1.300	94	108	P	15,700	108	140Lochgilphead	A	6.500	45	81	P	8.200	85	135Portree	A	1,800	12	28	P	5,500	67	135Oban	A	7.500	39	137	P	10,800	48	161Fort William	A	5,200	17	78	P	10,200	41	144Areas in 7 Highland Counties	A	184,400	2,552	4,316	P	242,900	3,313	5,671Rothesay	ft	9,800	95	333Pitlochry	A	9,900	33	88	P	15,000	99	190	Total Population		Total Unemployed	7 Highland Counties		278,000	4,400	7,700activity on a worthwhile scale. The population and numbers unemployed in the labourcatchment area at and surrounding each town can also be estimated, both at present,and potentially if wider travel became possible. These urban areas can be grouped intofifteen neighbouring zones listed above.

For our purposes the most important thing to note is that, potentially, these catchmentareas would include over four-fifths of the population and nearly three-quarters of theunemployed in the Highland Counties. They also include most of the burghs and otherholding points where population is already increasing or stable and age structure is fairly well balanced.71. Some of these and other smaller holding points are appropriate centres for both forestry and tourist development; the larger of them have advantages for in-dustrial development additional to labour supply, in respect of industrial sites, housingland, water supplies, and communication by road, rail, sea and/or air.

The aggregate changes are not true gross figures of 1960-64changes in employment by individual firms but are the sums of the net changes in the individual industries(Minimum List Headings) within each Order. The changes are given to the nearest 100 for statistical convenienceonly: this degree of precision is not implied. The percentage changes have been rounded to the nearest I whereover 5 per cent and to the nearest 1 where under 5 per cent.(b) No percentage change is given because of the margins of error in the basic figures.

The 1954 figures on the 194K Standard Indus-trial Classification have been adjusted to make them roughly comparable with those lor 1960 and onthe 1958 Classification.(b) The smaller of the all-Scotland figures are subject to margins of error see footnote ((/) to Table 10.(c) The regional figures exclude civil servants not holding insurance cards and some merchant seamen not covered by card exchanges (both of which are included in the all-Scotland figures) and do not lake full accountof cards exchanged outside the regions in which the employees worked. In addition the figures are subject tomargins of error. They can thus provide no more than broad indications of the magnitude of the changes andthe distribution of employees between the regions and between the sectors of industry within these. Because ofthis the numbers of employees have been rounded to the nearest thousand and the percentage changes to the nearest 1 where over 5 per cent and to the nearest \ where under 5 per cent. Caution is needed in using these
