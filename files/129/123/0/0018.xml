LONDON TRANSPORTMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of LancasterAt their meeting on 23rd November (C. C. (65) 63rd Conclusions,Minute 1) the Cabinet invited me to arrange for the Sub-Committee on transport Policies to report within two weeks on the prospects of finding positive and foreseeable solutions to the fundamental problemsof London Transport, as a basis for an immediate decision to be takenabout raising fares.Fundamental problems2.       The problem is formidable and of growing urgency.    It is how to arrest the growing deterioration in the services and finances ofLondon Transport and ease traffic congestion, especially in the peakhours - and how to accomplish this in the comparatively short run.3.       The root cause of this triple problem is the rapid growth in theuse of the private car.    At present 72 per cent of all the road passengervehicles coming into Central London between 7. 00 and 10. 00 a. rn. areprivate cars.    They carry only 31 per cent of the total passenger load on the roads (and only about 7 per cent of the total numbers cominginto London daily by transport of all kinds).     Buses, carrying61 per cent of the total road passengers, account for only 5. 2 per cent of the vehicles on the roads.     Private cars, motor cycles, etc.constitute 95 per cent of all passenger vehicles.    Evidence suggests,however, that a reduction in the use of private cars by commuters atpeak hours only would not of itself provide the remedy for the london transport Board1 s financial problem,    This is because london transport has suffered a heavy loss of traffic outside Central Londonand outside peak hours.    Unless, therefore, we deliberately bothencourage people to use public transport at all times by providing an efficient and comfortable service and discourage people from usingcars in areas and times of congestion, we shall not get a return of passengers to public transport sufficiently large to make a real impact on the London Transport Board&apos;s financial problem.The role of public transport4.       The private car can never replace public transport in London.There is not the room for it.    The point of strangulation would bereached long before the private car could bring into Central London the1^ million who are daily carried on public transport of all kinds.-1-HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS GOVERNMENT)C.

CONFi DEE NTIAL4 &apos; - &apos;7What the private car is doing however is to make such inroads into theefficiency and financial viability of public transport as to imperil, its future.    London is in a vicious circle.    As passengers leave public transport for the private car, so public services decline in efficiency and increase in price.    That sets the circle in motion again and thatis the rot that has to be stopped.How to stop the rot5.       The first essential is to devise workable and effective meansof reducing the number of private cars coming into Central Londoncertainly at peak periods and probably at some other times of the day.6.       The second essential is to provide and finance the improvedpublic transport services necessary to take the extra load.7.       On peak hour service we need drastically to reduce congestion in Central London, and on the main commuter routes to make bus and rail services better at reasonable fares.    Restraint of traffic in central London and other congested points must be used to persuadepeople to switch from private to public transport.    We must alsomaintain adequate off-peak services even thoxigh they may be run at a loss.    A switch of traffic from private to public transport will increasethe London Transport Board1 s revenue; but the provision of betterservices will add to their costs.     v/e cannot expect this combination of measures by itself to make the Board financially viable again.    Ifpublic transport in London is to continue to provide broadly speaking thesame type of service as at present and unless restrictions on the use ofth3 private car at off peak hours and throughout the metropolitan area are to be imposed, there seems no alternative to the long term prospectof periodic increases in fares as costs rise, and some form of subsidy(which might be met by appropriating the revenues from parking fees, orother restrictions on the private motorist).What form of subsidy?8.       The possibility of a general Exchequer subsidy to london transport as a permanent arrangement has not formed part of our study of this problem.     People outside London will not see why they should pay to keep down fares and support transport services in London.Therefore we must look to some kind of revenue raised especially inLondon.     There are two main possibilities -(a) To place additional charges on vehicles using congestedareas of London and use the revenue to subsidise public transport (whether charges are parking meters, or charges on off-street parking, or a supplementary licence for use in Central London, or full &quot;road pricing&quot;, isbeing studied urgently and can be decided later).(b) A tax on employment in the most congested areas, perhapsgraduated by the extent to which the hours of workcoincide with peak traffic hours (this has not yet been studied closely).-2-coi .u-:l.L      l.

Both these techniques would have the advantage of helping to reducepeak hour congestion in the streets and would make it easier to providea decent service.9.      While there is no need to decide now on the precise method, wedo need to be reasonably sure that a solution can be found, that it willbe effective, and that it can be brought into operation within a reason-able period.    Is that solution in sight?    If so, we can begin to talk about it and promise action.Action10.     The Sub-Committee believes that studies so far made arehopeful in this respect.11. Information is rapidly becoming available upon which decisions on the choice of method can be made with confidence.12. The Sub-Committee therefore feel able to suggest the following steps -(1)   We should announce in the near future that we intend tobring forward measures to arrest the growingdeterioration of public transport and traffic conditionsin London,(2)   To this end we should say -(a) That an efficient and reasonably priced public transport system is essential to the life and workof London and that the services of London transport by road and rail must not only be maintained butimpr removed.(b) That the imperative need is to keep people arid trafficmoving in London and enable public transport to give better, quicker, more comfortable and morepunctual services, even if this means restrictingor discouraging the use of private cars.(c) That private users who contribute to the costlycongestion of traffic in London should make some contribution to the maintenance of development ofpublic transport for those who do not possess motorcars or who co-operate by not bringing them intoLondon.(d) That this contribution may be made by a possiblecombination of -(i)   extra charges for the use of vehicles in central london (and possibly in other congested areas);(ii)   a tax on employment (possibly linked to hours ofwork) in Central London (and possibly in othercongested areas).-3-

l^cl MM trE ^1 I 3 r\ mWhile not committed to precise methods, which are under urgent study, the Government are resolved tofind a solution to a problem which is manifestlygetting worse.(3)   In addition -(a) We should consult with the Greater London Councilon the problems of transport and traffic management in London and what role and responsibility the G. L. C.should have in finding solutions to these problems.(b) We should recognise that even with the aid of subsidies and improvements in productivity public transportfares will have to rise with costs ana prices,especially wages, and that subsidies could well beused to maintain and improve services rather than to provide cheap commuter fares in peak periods.13.     If the Cabinet endorse these principles we believe it should bepossible to work out a policy for London Transport on this basis withinabout six months.14. It is for the Cabinet to decide whether to defer the increase in fares meanwhile. But whenever the announcements are made, someforecast of intended measures should be made at the same time.D.
