Department of Economic Affairs, s. W. 1.22nd December, 1965; DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)66C. (65) 107 COPY NO. ,__22nd December, 1965CABINETSCOTTISH TEACHERS&apos; salaries memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretaryof State for Economic affairs as the Secretary of State for Scotland says in his memorandum(C. (65) 1C2) no agreement was reached in the E. D. (P. I. ) Sub-Committeeon his proposals for Scottish teachers1 salaries.     But I am bound tosay that most Ministers present appeared to think, as I do, that if theproposed increase of 15 per cent were granted it would seriouslyundermine the prices and incomes policy at a time when we areintensifying our efforts to make it effective.2.     I recognise that the salary increases earlier this year for teachers in Ehigland and Vales is a relevant consideration.    But evenif one were to think simply in terms of equality of treatment, theSecretary of State&apos;s proposals seem to me to go too far.    pie arguesthat the right way to approach the matter is to look at total earningsover the whole period from 1963 to 1967 and suggests that an increaseof about 15 per cent is necessary to achieve parity with England andWales.    But this is not the principle on which pay decisions are normally based in the public services or anywhere else.    How can webreak out of the pay spiral if workers are to be encouraged to jobbackwards and forwards over several years to compare total earnings?3.      There seems to me every reason to fear that a 15 per cent increase for the Scottish teachers would be regarded by public opinion(including trade union opinion) as simply another case of leap-froggingin pay.    Sophisticated arguments will not help to avoid this impression,because people do not understand or trust them.   I do not believe thatwe can assume that this would attract little attention outside Scotland.I believe on the contrary that it would be widely regarded as an indication that we are not serious in our intention to get the prices and incomes situation under control.4.      I am not unmindful of the difficulties in all this for theSecretary of State.      In the circumstances I would see advantage in referring the matter to the National Board for Prices and Incomes(which in the New Year will be less heavily loaded).    This would notrule out giving an immediate increase of a reasonable amount to theScottish teachers while the matter was under examination by the Board.
