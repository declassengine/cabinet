3rd December, 1965CABINETEARNINGS-RELATED SHORT-TERM BENEFITS:CONTRIBUTION LIABILITY AMD CONTRACTING OUTMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of LancasterAt their meeting on 25th November (C. C. (65) 64th Conclusions,Minute 2), the Cabinet invited me to arrange for the Social services committee to consider the relative advantages of the alternative proposalsfor those contracted out of the graduated pension scheme.General background.       The Government are committed to the introduction of earnings-related short-term benefits.    It follows that these should be financed byearnings-related contributions.    To be consistent with the principlesunderlying the national insurance scheme since 1948 it also follows that particular groups of individuals should not be excepted from this chargebecause their risk of unemployment is small or because they get pay duringsickness.    Therefore it is necessary to impose the extra f per centgraduated contribution on all those who are contracted out of the graduated scheme and who at present pay no graduated contribution.    There can beno escape from requiring them to pay the \ per cent graduated contribution towards the new earnings-related benefits.    The only question is whether,while we are about it, we should take the opportunity of reforming thepresent unsatisfactory contracting out arrangements.    This will have tobe done later in any event, as part of the major review.    There is muchto be gained by doing it now.The Alternatives3.       It should be understood that the question for decision relates solely to those contracted out of the graduated scheme.    Those v/ithin the graduated scheme will pay the extra graduated contribution on top of theirpresent 4^ per cent and no difficulties arise.    All is straightforward there.As regards those contracted out we can do one of two things -(a) reform the contracting out arrangements so as to remove existinganomalies, the chief of which arises from the higher flat-rate contribution payable by those contracted out of the graduated scheme (2s. 5d. a week more for men);   or(b) impose the minimum graduated contribution necessary for thenew earnings-related unemployment, sickness and widow&apos;sbenefits - and stop there.These alternatives are now examined in detail.-1-3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)66C.(65) 167 COPY NO.

-4 ?&apos;1JL :VJ JLCourse A4.       This is to change the basis of contracting out as proposed by theMinister.    It involves payment by the contracted out of the full graduated contributions like everyone else in return for the same benefits as every-one else.    These people would by definition also be in an approvedoccupational scheme (otherwise they could not have been contracted out).To avoid an excessive total contribution a reduction would be made intheir flat-rate contribution, with a corresponding reduction in theirflat-rate pension.Advantages of Course A5.       In summary the principal advantages are -(l)    Provision for the contracted out of cover for graduated widow&apos;pension.&apos;(2)    Reduction of the total contribution payable by the lower paidcontracted out on whom the present special flat rate contributionbears unduly heavily.(3)    Removal of the obstacle built into the present contracting outarrangements which virtually precludes future increases ofthe graduated pension (the rate of which has been unchangedsince 1959) and the introduction of dynamism until such time as contracting out of the graduated scheme is discontinued.(4)    Removal of the obstacles in present arrangements to futureenlargement of the graduated scheme to help finance futuregeneral benefit increases, (flat-rate and graduated) whichwould benefit both the lower paid contributor and the Exchequer,since graduated contributions attract no Exchequer supplement.For this reason too the change proposed will produce additional revenue of some  40 million for the national insurance fundwithout attracting extra Exchequer supplement.Disadvantage of Course A6*       The disadvantage of course A lies entirely in its effect on a largenumber of employees in the public sector v/ho are contracted out, because it raises the difficult issue of &quot;abatement&quot; of their occupational pension.Under existing &quot;abatement&quot; conditions public employees would pay andqualify for a graduated pension which would be offset against their publicservice pension.    That v/ould mean that they would pay for somethingthey would not get.    In addition, as already explained, they will get leesflat rate pension than they do at present.    The effect is especially serious,and the issue of abatement therefore most acutely raised, in the case ofcivil servants and members of the Armed Forces in non-contributorypublic service pension schemes, since in their case the extra national insurance contribution cannot be offset by reduction in occupationalcontribution.    About half a million of them would, under present rules,be required to pay more and receive less by way of total pension provision.Additionally, there is a special problem, in relation to the substantially increased contribution liability of married women (including 70, 000married women teachers) who are both contracted out of the graduated-2-

scheme and have themselves &quot;opted out&quot; of the national insurance fiat ratescheme.    To the extent that concessions would have to be made permittingboth graduated national insurance and occupational pension to be paidtogether in full, this would be expensive to public authorities in the long-term, result in over-pensioning, particularly among the lower paid, andbe liable to prejudice the subsequent working out of a viable relationship between occupational pension schemes in the public sector and theGovernments eventual national superannuation plan.How Far Can The Disadvantages of Course A be Eliminated?7.       The Committee considered but ruled out making arrangements whereby existing public servants might draw both their occupational pensionin full together v/ith graduated pension in full, and &quot;aba.tem.ent&quot; imposedonly on those joining the public services after the scheme was introduced(on the lines of the arrangements made in 1948 in relation to the intro-duction of compulsory insurance for flat rate national insurance pensions).8.       The Committee gave closer consideration to the possibility of anarrangement whereby all graduated contributions paid by public servants in the period between the appointed day for the introduction of the schemefor earnings-related short-term benefits and the implementation of the major- review should qualify for National Insurance pension on top ofpublic service pension entitlement.    There would be no abatement of benefits accrued during this period.    This transitional arrangement wouldbe entirely without prejudice to any future arrangements for &quot;abatement&quot;or for the re-shaping of the public service pension schemes which may befound necessary (and which would in any case be discussed with staffinterests) when the relationship between occupational schemes and theproposed new national superannuation scheme emerges more clearly fromthe major review now in progress.9.       On this suggestion a majority of the Committee felt that there wasa serious risk of a temporary concession of this nature becoming difficultsubsequently to withdraw and that it would therefore prejudice futurenegotiations in the context of the national superannuation plan.    At thesame time, since it would be made as a purely temporary arrangement itwould introduce an atmosphere of uncertainty about the future. Moreover,it would not avoid the difficulty inherent in course A, of charging asubstantial additional contribution to members of the Armed Forces and teachers who represented fields of particular sensitivity in matters of pa.y.10.      The minority of the Committee however felt that the risks wereminimal and that an arrangement on these lines offered an opportunity of achieving a generally acceptable settlement at negligible cost which oughtto be taken in order to gain the advantages offered by course A in thedevelopment of the Governments pension plans and in the elimination of present inequities.    The minority argued that the staff intereststhemselves would never expect or desire to be in two full-scale pension schemes at the same time after the major review, and that no prejudicewould result from covering all graduated benefits accruing in themeantime.Course 311.      To leave the contracting out arrangements unchanged and to charge the contracted out the minimum contribution of ^ per cent required to finance earnings-related short-term benefits.rj) r-5

j^l ri fgrfSa iM 1 l^r^MAdvantage of Course B12.     The advantage of course B is that the contribution increase for thehigher paid is smaller and there is no reduction in pension entitlement.(Nevertheless, it raises in a less acute form exactly the same problem ofabatement as scheme A).    It is also argued that, unsatisfactory as it is,it is better to leave the existing graduated pension scheme unchanged untilall its inequities can be swept away together.Disadvantages of Course B13.     The principal disadvantage of course B is that it will not do the job of course A, i.e. that it will perpetuate the inequities and anomalies ofthe present arrangements and lead to difficulties in financing the nextbenefit increase.    Additionally however-(l)    It will involve a disproportionate increase in work for employersand the Ministry in collecting the relatively small graduated contributions of j per cent of earnings for the 5 million contracted out.(2)    It will not avoid raising the issue of abatement.    Although the- amount of graduated pension for which the \ per cent contributionwill qualify the contracted out will be derisory, this is unlikely to stop people raising the same issue of principle as course A.The temporary arrangement suggested in paragraph 8 may stillbe necessary to remove a sense of grievance or alleged&quot;prejudging of the issue&quot;,(3)    It will increase the already heavy contribution burden on thelower paid contracted out.(4)    There will be embarrassment for the Government in departing from course A which the Minister discussed with the T. U, C,and other bodies concerned and very largely persuaded them toaccept (although a Forking Party of the Local authority associations in fact prefers course B).Conclusions14.     The majority of the Committee preferred course B to course Asince it avoided raising, in as acute a form as course A, the difficultissue of abatement at a time when no complete solution could be found, nor(in their view) any satisfactory temporary arrangement devised to reduce to tolerable dimensions the disadvantageous effect of course A on the employees in the public sector.    Course B also avoided tinkering with the graduated pension scheme until it could be replaced by national super-annuation;  in particular it avoided extending the &quot;swindle&quot; to the contracted out at a time when no immediate improvement in the value for money offered by the graduated pension scheme could be made.15.     Among the supporters of course B the Minister of Defence for theRoyal Navy, on behalf of the Secretary of State for Defence, stressed thesensitivity in the Armed Forces to any worsening of terms of service, and considered that, pending the introduction of national superannuation, thereshould under course B be no abatement of pension benefits accruing in the interval between the introduction of the scheme and the major review, i. e.the temporary arrangement referred to in paragraph 8 should apply tocourse B.-4-

* 9 Ikjl    ^16.    A minority of tlie Committee preferred course A to course Bbecause of the advantages if offered in eliminating the inequities of thepresent contracting out arrangements;  in the financing of future benefit increases;  and in opening the way to improverrient of the graduated pension scheme.    They felt that a satisfactory temporary solution of thepblem of abatement could be achieved on the lines suggested inparagraph 8, whereby, pending the introduction of national superannuation,pay and pensions in the public sector would not be reduced by referenceto national insurance graduated benefits.    They also took the view thatthere was greater objection to perpetuating all the inequities of thepresent scheme pending national superannuation than there was to makingimprovements in the meantime.    In their view it would be a serious matter to be diverted by a sectional interest from a major reform havingfot its aims the removal of injustices and a desirable measure of redistribution of the burdens of the scheme in favour of the lower paid.17.     The Cabinet are asked to decide which course shall be followed,A or B, and, if B, whether the strong representations of the Secretary ofState for Defence outlined in paragraph 15 should be met.D.
