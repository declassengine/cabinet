u3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;C GOVERNMENT),--------------------------------------------------------.-------------^-------00C.(65) 162 COPY NO. _26th Novembsr, 1965CABINETFAIRFIELD SHIPBUILDING AND ENGINEERING CO. LTD.Memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretaryof State for Economic /iffairsOn 3rd November we agreed to guarantee an advance of up to 1 million to Fairfields by the Bank of England, in order to keep the yardin full operation until Ministers had had an opportunity to consider theReport of the Geddes Committee, which is expected in February.    Thisdecision was based on an analysis made by the Receiver of the cashposition of the Group up to 31st March next,2.       Since that decision the Receiver has had an opportunity of goingmore fully into the position and has had discussions with all those whohave ships on order with Fairfields.    Included in the programme of workwhich the yard would hope to undertake are three new ships to be started in the next few weeks or months, which are essential to the yard&apos;economic position.    Two of these are for Reardon Smith, to be completed by the end of 1967, and one for the Navy Department running into 1969.3.       Briefly the Receiver&apos;s assessment of the position is as follows:-(i) there should be no special difficulties with those owners whoseships have been launched and are due to be completed duringthe first half of 1966;(ii)  there is only one ship at present under construction in the yard;  it is due to be launched at the end of April, 1966 and completed in September, 1966.    The owners (british petroleum Tankers) have indicated that they would intend to remove this ship and have it built elsewhere unless the receiver can provide assurances that the ship will becompleted in time;(iii)  at present four of the five berths in the yard are vacant.Unless new work is laid down soon, labour will loseconfidence and drift away.    Moreover, if the yard is to be operated economically, its large and heavily capitalisedsteel shop must be kept fully occupied.    To achieve this,the Receiver believes that the yard must proceed as quickly as possible with the work  on the new destroyerand tv/o bulk carriers for Reardon Smith, for which ithas contracts; he also thinks it would be desirable tosecure further orders before long and is hoping for twoair store support ships for which the yard has submittedtenders but on which no decisions have yet been takenbecause these ships are covered by the current DefencePreview;-1-

(iv) neither Reardon Smith nor the Navy Department are willingto see work on their ships started unless they can be assured that it will be carried through to completion.Reardcn Smith have indicated that they will want to placetheir contract elsewhere unless the Receiver can give themsuch assurances by 2nd December;(v)  once committed to a further programme of v/ork, Fairfieldswould have to remain in business until at least the end of1968.    By then all current contracts for merchant ships should have been completed.    The Navy Department shipwould have been launched, but would continue fitting outuntil early 1969.4.      The Receiver takes the view that he cannot himself give the assurances sought by B.F., Reardcn Smith and the Navy Departmentpartly because he cannot be certain that the creditors will not at some stage force a liquidation and partly because he cannot foresee the positionbeyond 31st March with sufficient certainty.    The yard can only embark on a new programme and complete the ship already on the berth if the receiver is given further support by the Government.5.       The interdepartmental group of officials who were instructed to supervise the Governmenfs interest in Fairfields have considered thesituation as it has now emerged.    They have concluded that the action we have so far taken will not achieve the objective which we had in mind of maintaining the yard in operation until 31st March next.    We are,therefore, now faced with a choice between doing nothing more or assuminga longer term commitment to maintain the yard in operation.6.       I have had a preliminary discussion of the problems involved andthe alternatives open to ug with the Chancellor and the President.     the alternatives seem to be -A. to let the yard be closed down by the Receiver;3. to extend the guarantees given to the Receiver;C.   to take over the yard.A.   Close the yard7.      E the Receiver io told that we are not prepared to extend the guarantees, he will be bound to run down and close the yard in quite ashort time.    He could be instructed to limit his call on the 5.1 million to the minimum required to avoid hardship to the employees.    Thiswould come as a great shock after our recent announcement and, howeverpresented, would be likely to appear as extremely inept handling of thesituation.    It would, moreover, deprive us cf what I think may be agre?.t opportunity, to which I refer later.3.   Extending the guarantees8.       This course would enable the Receiver to give the assurances tothe shipowners that their orders would be completed.   To be effective inthis respect it would, need to extend to the end of 1967 for the ReardonSmith ships and to the beginning of 1969 for the Navy Department ship.This would achieve the object of keeping the yard open until the Geddes-2-

CONFIDENTIAL    .        , ,Report had been received, would maintain employment, and avoid thereversal of policy involved in Course A.    It would, however, leave us with an indefinite financial commitment, put at a maximum of  3 million by the Receiver, and a situation over which we would not have a degree ofcontrol commensurate with the financial risk incurred.    Furthermore,it would be extremely difficult for the Receiver to try to run the Companyas a normal business for a long period;  the employees would be anxious about the continuity of their jobs and would undoubtedly accept alternative employment as it became available.    However able the Receiver, hewart /ould be fighting a losing battle.C.   Take over the yard9.       This could be done by the Government alone or in partnership with private industry on the lines indicated in &quot;Signpost for the Sixties&quot;.I understand from the Chancellor of the Exchequer that Sir Isaac Vtrolf sonhad expressed an interest in the idea of buying the yard.    I believe,however, that, following a meeting between Sir Isaac and Sir William&quot;Watson of the Bank of Scotland, it is doubtful whether Sir Isaac willpursue the matter further.10.      The disadvantages of this course - alone or in partnership - are that we would be stepping in and acquiring a company which had failed, a company in an inefficient and contracting industry, an industry which mustshortly be reorganised if it is to survive.    On the other hand, it seemsto me that this is a wonderful opportunity to get to grips with the situationand show what can be done by increased productivity.    I have been impressed by what Iain Stewart has told me can be achieved in this industry in co-operation v/ith the Unions.    I am sure he would be preparedto take a principal part in putting these ideas into practice and he has inmind a competent managing director who is already achieving success onthese lines in an adjacent yard, and who is likely to be willing to act as chief executive.    They would need to be supported by other directors withparticular experience in industrial relations and finance and it wouldprobably be helpful to have a member of the Scottish T. U. C. on the Board.I would expect that in due course this experiment would be an example tothe rest of the shipbuilding industry.11.      The total amount owing to the Bank of Scotland and the creditorsis about  6. 5 million, so that this figure would be the absolute maximum of Government money involved in the takeover.    It is probable, however,that the takeover operation could be achieved by negotiation for considerably less (for example, there is a subsidiary company, Fairfield-Rowan, which,for technical reasons, is not in receivership, for which something over 2 million is included in the  6. 5 million and which might not have to betaken over at all).12.      If we decided to adopt this course, we should require time to investigate the position fully, to consult v/ith the Unions and to make thenecessary arrangements to acquire the yard in the most appropriate way.(I have not had time to establish whether legislation would be required).To get the time required we should have to give the Receiver theminimum undertaking necessary to enable him to keep the yard open tothe end of 1967 for the Reardon Smith ships, which is in effect, thetemporary adoption of Course B.    I think this is a justifiable measure tokeep open the possibility of this experiment.    (We could presumablyconsider the position of the Navy Department ship as soon as v/e were satisfied with the arrangements for acquiring the yard).13.      I hope my colleagues will agree that Course C, although theboldest, would be the best course in the long run.G. B.Department of Economic Affairs. S, W. 1.,6th never,ber, ^pNFlMNTtAL
