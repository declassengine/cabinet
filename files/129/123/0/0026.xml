15 DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(65) 176 COPY NO.    669th December, 1965CABINETPROPOSALS FOR RESHAPING NATIONAL, assistance memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and. National InsuranceAt their meeting on 29th July (C. C.(65) 43rd Conclusions,Minute 3) the Cabinet agreed that, following the deferment of income guarantee, I should prepare for consideration by the Social services committee a scheme for remodelling National Assistance so as to incorporate in it as many features as possible of the Guarantee.2.      It is abundantly clear from the allocation made to my department that-for the next few years we shall be precluded from making any large scale advances in social security generally.    This strengthens rny con-viction that if we are concerned about social priorities we must devisesome means within the stringency of funds allocated to improve the lot of the most deprived of our people - those in receipt of national assistance and those who could have it but for one reason or anotherwill not apply for it.    I have now worked out proposals which I believewill go a long way to make supplementary payments more attractiveand more acceptable.    They have the great merit of enabling us to curtail the detailed enquiries which are so widely resented by people in need and they remove many of the other less desirable features ofNational Assistance which led us to think of an Income Guarantee in thefirst place.    Indeed the scheme contains most of the features of ourearlier proposals for an Income Guarantee.    Subject to bringing theproposals within the public expenditure allocated to me, they have beenapproved in principle by the Social Services Committee who consideredmy memorandum S. S.(65) 31 on 17th November (S. 3.(65) 17th Meeting,Minute 2) which explained my proposals in detail.3,       The main features of my scheme are as follows:-(a) the re-narning of national assistance;(b) the transfer to the Minister from the (renamed) national assistance Board of the power to initiate changes in theNational Assistance regulations.    I am pursuing separatelymore fundamental changes in the organisation of the Ministryof Pensions and National Insurance and the national assistance Board v/ithin a Ministry of Social Security;(c) the provision for people over pension age and other long-termcases, of a standard allowance of 7s. 6d. a week in partialsubstitution for small discretionary additions;-1-

fj .J(d) the replacement of the existing variable rent allowance for non-householders by a standard rent allowance of 10s. a week;(e) the rationalisation and modernisation of disregards;(f) combined order books for retirement pensions and non-contributory benefits as soon as practicable;(g) an option for claimants over pension age to be interviewed athome or to submit a written statement, to be followed by an interview which could be at a departmental office;(h) the renewal of claims for elderly and other long-term casescovered by (b) to be put on an annual basis, with small interimchanges of circumstances ignored;(i) new arrangements for following-up pensioners who do not claimnon-contributory benefit and do not indicate they do not wantit.For reasons mentioned later, I am convinced that these proposals should be brought into effect as soon as possible, which would be, forthe most part, in the autumn of 1966, when I expect that a normalincrease in National Assistance scale rates will be necessary.    A bill would be necessary to give effect to the proposals at (a), (b), (c) and (f)above.    A place has been reserved in the legislative programme for aMinistry of Social Security Bill.4.      There are also particular reasons why a decision is urgent.    Inthe early months of the New Year we must publish the results of therecent survey of retirement pensioners, which confirms that there are many pensioners eligible for Assistance but not receiving it.    We mustad so face a fresh Private Member&apos;s Bill designed to provide retirement pensions for people at present ineligible for them.    In order to settlehow these issues should be handled in Parliament, we must know withinthe next few weeks what more we are prepared to do to make national assistance more acceptable to the minority of old people who, thougheligible, do not claim it.    My colleagues will remember how heavilyv/e relied on what v/e thought at the time to be the early prospect of income Guarantee in dealing with Mr. Airey Neave&apos;s Bill last Session.5.      In my basic programme some provision has already been madefor a measure of success in the current publicity campaign to combatreluctance to apply for National Assistance.   After allowing for thisprovision, the additional cost of my present proposals i3 unlikely to exceed  32 million in the first full year or to reach  40 millionthereafter.    Gn the basis of decisions so far taken, I still have  18million in hand from my allocation of public expenditure for 1969-70.The extra cost of my present proposals in that year is estimated at 38 million.    I am thus left with the problem of finding savings in mybasic programme to the tune of some  20 million in 1969-70.    I under-stand that the Chancellor of the Exchequer accepts that, with suchsavings, the extra cost could be accommodated within my public expenditure limits for the intervening years as well.6,       I regard the need to modernise and improve National assistance as so urgent and so important that I would be prepared to achieve sucha saving.    As a matter of social priorities, I think it would be-2-CONFIDENTIAL&quot;V,

M tCI T\V2 KIT I A. Ijustifiable to achieve it by increasing benefits generally on the nextoccasion - in 1967 - by somewhat less than would be strictly correct if wewere fully reflecting the rise in earnings since the last general increase.    (Since the extra cost of my Assistance proposals would bea permanent addition, the amount withheld in 1967 could not be restoredlater.)   It is, of course, impossible to predict with complete accuracywhat that rise would turn out to be and hence the increase in rates which  /e could afford to give and still s 3.V6 SOITIG ic 20 million in 1969-70.   Ican, however, give my colleagues a broad indication.7.      The best guess we can make suggests that by mid-1967 a strictand complete reflection of the rise in earnings, in money terms, would justify an increase of some 12c. a week in the standard rate of national insurance pension for a single person, with corresponding increases inother rates.    If instead of giving the full increase v/e gave Is. less (orthe equivalent) all round, including Assistance and War Pensions, thiswould save about  25 million in 1969-70.    Since the increases in themain rates of benefit would have to be rounded off at least to the nearest6d., the adjustment is in practice unlikely to turn out exactly at Is. aweek and might need to be a little higher in order to ensure a sufficiently large total saving.8.      I ask the Cabinet -(l)     to endorse my proposals for remodelling Assistance with effect,generally speaking, from next autumn;  and(2)    to agree that, to the extent necessary to accommodate their cost within my programme limit for 1969-70, the amount ofthe general benefit increase in 1967 should be somewhat lessthan would be justified by an exact and complete reflection ofthe rise in earnings since the last general increase.M.H.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, W.
