C. (65) 15722nd November, 1965CABINETEARNINGS-RELATED SHORT-TERM BENEFITS:IMPIJCATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC SECTuR OF THE proposed change IN THE BASIS OF CONTRACTING OUTMote by the Chief Secretary, TreasuryAt the meeting of the Cabinet on 11th November (C. C. (65)60th Conclusions, Minute 3) I was invited in consultation with thebanisters concerned to give further consideration to this subject.    Inthe time available I have not been able to consult my colleagues whoare responsible for public sector pension schemes, and the attached paper prepared by officials does not commit them;  but the figures havebeen prepared in consultation with their Departments.2.       Under the proposals made by the Minister of Pensions over half a million civil servants and members of the Armed Forces willbe called on to pay something for nothing.    They will have to pay a weekly contribution for a pension benefit which they already enjoy.This contribution will not be large - broadly something between Is.and 4s. a week;  and that only if they are among the better paid.    Butit would be well to recognise that this will give rise to a source of grievance - especially in already sensitive areas - and that long and difficult negotiations will have to take place.3.       It may well happen that the expression of this disappointmentmay not be fully matched by an equivalent expression of satisfaction bythe half million whose contributions will be reduced by anything up to5s. a week - and that for the very good reason that they earn little.4.       There are many other public sector employees likely to beaffected to a minor degree as described in the paper.     One group,however, stands out for special consideration - married women:70,000 in teaching alone will pay up to 6s. a week more.5.       The full extent of the disadvantage goes beyond the increase in contributions referred to in paragraph 2.     For the million membersof the Civil Service and Armed Forces who pay nothing towards their pensions will get up to  120 per annum less in total retirement income.6.      Nevertheless I accept the Ministers views both as to the logicof the proposed scheme of flat rate abatement (balancing a fixedamount of employer-provided pension with a fixed amount of State -provided pension) and as to its inevitability in a few years&apos; time.Moreover, if the principle that public service pensions must be abatedin respect of National Insurance graduated pension were abandoned,-1-66THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PS.OPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

extension of the National Insurance scheme in clue course to providelarger graduated benefits for higher paid workers could not be matched by corresponding adjustments in public service pensions.     The Stateand the local authorities wculd be involved in expensive over-provision in total pension for the staffs of the public services.7.       If the Cabinet accept the Minister&apos;s conclusion that sectionalinterests should not dictate the form of the national scheme, they may decide that it is worth taking a calculated risk on the outcome of the employer-employ ee negotiations (which must clearly be undertaken)in return for the economic and social benefit of her proposals.J.D.Treasury Chambers, S. W...1.22nd November, 1965-2-

IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PUBLIC SECTOR OF THEPROPOSED CHANGE IN THE BASIS of contracting OUTGeneralThe great majority of the public services are at presentcontracted out of the graduated scheme.    But the rules of mostschemes provide that, if graduated pension is earned, the occupational pension is reduced by the same amount.    Thus, the proposed changein the basis of contracting out affects the way in which contracted outpublic servants earn pensions, as follows:(a) Non-contributory&apos;&apos;- pension schemes (Civil Service and armed forces) - 1, 120,000Members of these schemes will, for part of their totalretirement benefits, change to a contributory scheme - the graduated scheme.    They will thus have to pay for something that up to now they have got for nothing.(b) &quot; Contributory pension schemes (National Health Services,local government teachers, police, and fire services) -approximately 1, 000, 000Members of these schemes, who are already contracted out,will switch part of their total contributory pension from their occupational to the graduated scheme.    In most schemes, thecontributions of employer and employee to the graduated scheme will be partly offset by reduced contributions by eachto the occupational scheme.    The rules of most schemes already enable this to be done.    But some schemes, notablythose for the Police and Fire Services, may have to be amended so that contributions could be modified and the occupational pension abated.(c) Nationalised industries    (about 1 million)Most nationalised industries contract all their employees outof the graduated scheme but, like the Police and Fire Serviceschemes, have no arrangements for modifying the occupational pension to take account of the graduated pension.The following paragraphs explain in more deta.il the effect of achange on contributions and pensions.Effects on contributions paid by the contracted out2.     There is an important difference between the effects, in termsof changed contributions, on those now contracted out who respectivelyearn more or less than about  14 a week.    There is insufficientevidence to enable a precise estimate to be made of how many will gain,lose or suffer little change.    In broad terms, the effects on maleemployees will be as follows (the effects on contracted out women willbe only slightly different):* i.e.   schemes to which, the employee does not contribute.-3-confidential   4

(a) Those earning less than about  14 a week there are about 800, 000 such in the public services, plusabout 280, 000 in the nationalised industries.    Since it is notpossible to split the figgures as between those respectively-above and below the cut-off point between gainers and losers,this estimate is very tentative.    But the following tablesillustrate the broad effect of a change.(i) Public services a. Non-contributory schemes (Civil Service and Armed Forces).

The figures also assume that the Police and Fire Service schemes v/ill be amended as suggested in paragraph 2.(ii)  Nationalised industriesNo breakdown is possible but the effects on the 280, 000(approximately) concerned will be broadly the same as that for those in contributory public service schemes.(b) Those earning more than  14 a weekThese include 1.5 million employees in the public services and670, 000 in the nationalised industries.    All in non-contributoryschemes will lose, but those in contributory schemes will sufferonly marginally as the following table illustrates:(i) Public Services-A-&apos;    Non-contributory schemes (Civil Service and Armed Forces)Weekly earnings Nos.Gain Q]i__Loss (-) in weeklyterms 15-  18   v 205,000 - lOd. to - 3s. 9d. 18-  30 285, 000 - 3s. 9d. to - 4s. lid.Over  30 80,000 - 4s. lid.-4-( 0

B.

The effect would be similar tothat on public service contributory schemes if the schemes were amended to provide for modification and abatement on public service lines.    Otherwise, the total, increase incontribution would be similar to that in non-contributory publicservice schemes but there would be a proportionate increasein pension.    Total pension would thus be too high.Married women3.     These present a special problem.    They include about 70, 000teachers and substantial, though unkown, numbers in other schemes.They will not benefit from the rebate in the National Insurance flat-rate contribution proposed for the contracted out and may in consequencepay up to 6s. Od a week more by way of contributions in contributoryschemes, such a.s Teaching, and up to 9s. 9d a   week more in non-contributory schemes.Effects on pensions4.     These can be summarised as follows:(a) Abatement of flat-rate National Insurance pensionEveryone, except married women opted out of the flat ratescheme, will lose because their flat rate national insurance pension will be abated by Is. a week for eachyear of service (rising to a maximum of 47s. a week for47 years&apos; service).    This lose will be offset for membersof some contributory schemes by a reduction in theextent to which their occupational pension is abated.(b) Additional graduated pension for widowsMembership of the graduated scheme will result for married men in a.n increase in a widow&apos;s national insurance pension.    She will thus get the fulloccupational and graduated widow&apos;s pensions to which her husband^ contributions entitle her.    about million out of the 3^ million pensionable employees inthe public sector are men, and most of these aremarried, but there is a concentration of women in the teaching and National Health Services which may affectthe extent to which this point carries weight with thestaff interests concerned as a whole.-5-

Overall financial effect in the first few years.     This is broadly illustrated in the following table:	Cost to employers	Cost to employeesCivil Service	2.0	2.0Armed Forces	1.65	1.65Teachers	1.5	1.national Health Service	0. 1	0. local Government	0.2	0. 2Police and Fire Services	0. 6	o, o	6.05	6. 05The figures of cost are net (increased contributions to national insurance minus reduced contributions to occupational schemes).    Allthe figures are approximate.Staff Reactions6.     Staff i-eactions to the proposed changes in National Insurancearrangements taken as a whole will be affected in part by their attitude to the earnings related short term benefits scheme in itself.    public servants are rarely unemployed.    Their sick pay schemes aregenerally superior to the proposed sickness benefit.    Thus they v/illnot generally gain directly in these respects from the additional contributions paid for the short term benefits (some public servantsqualify for unemployment benefit for some months if they retire beforethe National Insurance retirement age).    Unless there are other changes, however, they may gain from the fact that tax relief is given on the part of sick pay which is equivalent to the National Insurancesickness benefit - and this will in future be a significantly larger partfor higher paid staff.7.     Against this background there will also be reactions - stronger than are justified by the figures set out above. - to the changes incontracting out arrangements.    Public sector employees generallydo not accept the principle that the traditional level of public service pensions should be altered in any way to take account of the fact that national Insurance benefits are now available which were notavailable when the pension schemes were framed.    They will thereforeresent changes which intensify the application of this principle,particularly if the result was that they had to pay more in contribution for less total pension.-6-
