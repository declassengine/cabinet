C.(65) 153 COPY NO.        6 016th November, 1965CABINETLONDON TRANSPORT FARESMemorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretaryof State for Economic AffairsBackgroundEarlier this year the London Transport Board sought agreement to increase fares by 10 per cent from May, 1965, indicating that afurther increase of the same order would be needed in March, 1966.The Government concluded that there should be a thorough examinationof the conditions under which the Board operated and of the possibilityof even more extensive measures of traffic management and restraintto improve those conditions.    We asked the Board to postpone faresincreases while this examination was undertaken, and undertook tomake good to the Board by a subsidy the  3. 85 million which the fares increase was expected to bring in by the end of 1965.    7. e are committed to fresh decisions to be effective not later than the beginningof 1966.2.       A number of improvements in traffic management (including theintroduction of 17 new urban clearways and 34 new major one-wayschemes) have been agreed for introduction during 1966.     these measures will not however substantially improve the London TCransportBoard&apos;s viability.    Without an increase in fares the Board&apos;s deficitsare likely to be not less than  8 million in 1966 and  10 million in1967 (these figures assume that wage costs rise by 3j per cent a year).Possible measures to increase efficiency and restrain the growth ofprivate transport (especially in Central London during peal: hours)are under discussion;  but there is no prospect that such measures could be introduced quickly enough or would be adequate to enable theLondon Transport Board to pay their way in 1966 and 1967 without anincrease of fares or an Exchequer subsidy.Proposal3.       The London Transport Board have now sought agreement foran overall increase in fares of 10 per cent from 2nd January, 1966.They consider this to be the maximum increase acceptable.    Such anincrease would raise not less than about  5. 5 million in 1966, on theassumption that traffic dropped by about 5 per cent as a result of theincrease:  if the drop in traffic was less - on which see paragraph 5 -the yield from the increase would be more.    On the basis of an estimated deficit of  8 million in 1966, a subsidy of up to about  2. 5 million in that year would still be required, even if fares went up by10 per cent;  if costs rise by more than has been allowed for, the deficit in 1966 will be higher and a larger subsidy would be needed.So whether fares go up on 2nd January, 1966, or not, the london transport Board will require a continuing subsidy in 1966,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

4.       This proposal has been discussed by the Sub-Committee on transport Policies and by the Ministerial Committee on economic development.    A majority of Ministers on each Committee thoughtthat the fares increase should be authorised; but some of us considerthat v/e should not accept a further increase of fares in London as wellas a continuing subsidy until we have a fuller picture of the positionand prospects for public transport in London, including the possibilities for major improvements in the public transport system and in themanagement and restraint of private traffic.Effect of fares increase on traffic5.       A decision turns partly on one&apos;s estimate of the effect on traffic of increasing fares.     The Board1 s original estimate, based onexperience with previous increases, was that a 10 per cent increasein fares would yield a 5 per cent increase in revenue (implying a dropof about 5 per cent in traffic).   The Chairman of the Board now says that that estimate took no account of recent extensions of parkingrestrictions and increases in meter charges in Central London;   andsome account must be taken of the effect of the increasing cost ofprivate motoring and the growth of congestion in Central London.    Itmay therefore be that the drop in traffic resulting from an increase in fares would be less than previous experience would lead one to expect.It seems reasonable to guess that the effect on peak hour traffic wouldbe very small indeed, and the effect on off peak traffic more marked.Majority view6.       The main arguments advanced by those who would favourauthorising the proposed increase are:(a) We have already postponed the increase from May and havearrived at the date v/e set ourselves then;  but there is no prospect ofa long-term plan which would transform the London Transport Board&apos;sviability being ready within a few months.(b) The decline in demand for public transport and the increase incongestion resulting from an increase cf fares of the order proposed would not be significant enough to prejudice any longer-term, solution.(c) Not to increase fares would be inconsistent with our generalpolicy that public enterprises should pay their own way;  we arc in danger cf allowing too many breaches of this principle.(d) London Transport fares were last raised in July, 1964.    since then bus and rail fares have risen all over the country, oftensubstantially.     There are already some signs of restiveness in otherparts of the country about this year&apos;s subsidy to London Transport.It would be difficult to justify continuing to bear upon the nationalExchequer (and so charge upon taxpayers generally) a subsidy thatwould protect the &quot;London passenger from any increase in fares.(e) The further London Transport&apos;g viability is allowed to deteriorate, the more difficult it will be to re-establish it or topersuad.e the Greater London Council to assume a share in the res-ponsibility for public transport in London, which some Ministersthink will be an essential element in any long-term solution.

(f)     While the immediate impact of a fares increase for prices and incomes policy is bound to be adverse, the effect is only deferred, notavoided, by carrying the whole deficit on the Exchequer, if additional revenue has to be raised by increases of indirect taxation which them-selves add to the cost of living.7.       These Ministers recognise the politicai implications of announcing an increase of London fares;  but they believe that mostpassengers would be ready to pay more  or a better service, and they therefore consider that the effects would be mitigated if the anncunce-ment of the fares increase were to be coupled with an announcement that showed that the Government meant business cn improving theservice.Minority view0.       Those of us who take the view that a fares increase should notbe authorised at this time ba.se it on fee following main arguments:(a) The issue is not whether or not London Transport shouldreceive a subsidy, but how much it should receive:   some continuingsubsidy is inevitable.(b) Just to put fa.res up by as much as the traffic will bear contributesnothing to the solution of the longer-term problem.    Indeed any drop in traffic - and these Ministers are not convinced feat fee drop following a 10 per cent fares increase would be insignificant - will exacerbate thelong-term problem.    We ought now to try to break out of the circle ofincreasing farce, increasing congestion and deteriorating public transport service.(c) An increase of fares v/ill do nothing to encourage imaginativemanagement ana improve efficiency, or to persuade the unions toco-operate in a number of imp-roverrents in the use of man-power whichhave been devised and ought to be introduced.(d) The problem of London transport is substantially different, indegree if not in kind, from fee problem in other large cities, and Londonfares are already the highest in fee country.    It is a metropolitanproblem, and we know of no other -metropolitan city in a developedcountry in which public transport is not heavily subsidised.(e) An increase in London fares would be bound to damage prices and incomes policy.    It woixld come into effect at just about the timewhen details of forthcoming increases in coal prices are announced.There is strong pressure for increases in gas prices in Scotland,Wales and fee Soufe-West.    All these price increases in fee public sector would be bound to make it more diffictilt to resist price increases in the private sector (for instance, fee price of bread) and wouldthreaten the credibility of the policy.9.       If it were possible to announce decisions on improvements ofthe service, feat would no doubt help to sugar the pill of an increase offares.    The trouble about feat is that there is a grave shortage of sugar:  there are no significant decisions to announce.    All we could produce would be a mixture of good intentions and studies in progress,which would look like nothing but the mixture as before.-3-

Legislation10.       I understand that whatever we do legislation will be necessary.We should need legislation to continue paying any subsidy, great or small, to London Transport after the end of this financial year.    Weshould need legislation to remit fuel tax (which would be an expensiveway of helping London Transport, since it would be impossible to denya similar remission to other bus operators, and would again contributenothing to the solution of the long-terra problem);  this could presumablybe included in the Finance Bill.    We should also need legislation forany special tax on congestion in London (for instance,    a supplementarylicence fee for cars wishing to enter Central London at certain timescf day), whether it was imposed by the central Government or by theGreater London Council.Conclusion11.       I have no agreed conclusion or recommendation to report.     Themajority view is that an increase of about 10 per cent in fares from2nd January, 1966, should be authorised, and that the announcementof the increase should be coupled with as forthcoming a statement as itis possible to make on traffic management and improvements ofservice.    Iviy own view is that we should not accept a further faresincrease in London as well as a continuing subsidy - and we shall haveto go on paying a subsidy in any case - until we have a much fullerjjicture of the position and prospects of public transport in London,including major improvements in the efficiency and even structure ofLondon Transport and major measures of traffic management andrestraint.     These studies should be carried forward with the utmosturgency.    In the meantime I consider that fares should remain as theyare, and that we should agree to continue to give London Transportwhatever subsidy will be needed to carry them over the next sixmonths.G.B.Department of Economic Affairs, S.W. 1.15th November, 1965
