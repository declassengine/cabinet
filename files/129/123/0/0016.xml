CONFIDENTIAL a a q11 Qus DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)0.(65) 166 COPY NO.    g g1st December, 1965CABINETPRICES AND INCOMES policy memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretaryof State for Economic affairs in the baking dispute we are now faxed with a real test of our intentions.    I understand that the Minister of labour feels there is a chance that the threatened national strike may now be called off on thebasis approved by the Cabinet on 30th November, (CC. (65) 66thConclusions, Minute 4) i. e. an interim 3-i per cent wage increase from 1st January, 1966, and an investigation of the union&apos;s claim for a further increase by the National Board for Prices and Incomes,     I am willingto accept the decision to try and reach a settlement on this basis andbelieve that it can just be reconciled with the prices and incomes policy.2.       We must however recognise that even on this basis the policy will have suffered some damage, bearing in mind the fact that the wor-kers had a reduction in hours from 42 to 40 (equivalent to a 5 per cent increase in rates and a 7 per cent increase in earnings) as recently asMay, 1965.    A further wage increase will inevitably involve a further increase in the price of bread which we have been trying to hold steady.All this will make it extremely difficult to persuade other unions who canexercise power to refrain from doing so and to go to the Board orobserve the principles of the prices and inconies policy.    It will alsohelp to foster a sense of injustice among those groups, such as the armed forces, who cannot or traditionally do not exercise such power,3.       These considerations make it imperative to avoid making anyfurther concessions if the bakers refuse to call off their strike on thebasis we have agreed.    Bearing in mind the strong power of example in this field it is clear that further concessions would do damage to thepolicy and its credibility in the eyes of observers at home and overseas.This in turn would require a fundamental reappraisal of our economic policies in general and of the objectives in the National Plan.    I do notpretend that the possibility of a national strike or other action by theunion which would seriously affect bread supplies is a pleasant one.But this is a test case.     v/e have always known that we should have to face these difficulties sooner or later.    In my view v/e must be ready to face them now, if this proves necessary.4,       I have an impression that a number of my colleagues are unwilling to face the consequences of their own decision to support the prices and incomes policy.    I am accordingly proposing to circulate a generalpaper on the policy next week in order that we may have a full discussionof it. ;*or. ID,Department of Economic Affairs, 3. V. 1.1st December, 1965
