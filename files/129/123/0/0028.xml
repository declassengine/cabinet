C.(65) 178 COPY NO. 6610th December, 1965CABINETSCHOOL MEALSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster the Social Services Committee have been unable to reach agreement on a proposal by the Secretary of State for Education and Science to increasethe charge for the school meal from next summer term.   He proposed toincrease the charge from If- to either l/6d. or, at a minimum, l/4d.He further proposed that in future there should be an annual review of thecharge in the light of any changes in the cost of providing the meal.2.      The Secretary of State for Scotland agrees that there is a case foran ?.annual review to take account of rises in costs, but does not considerthat this is the time to make any change in the share of the cost falling onthe parents, which the 6d increase would involve, and would strongly prefer to make no increase at all at present.Arguments in favour of an increased charge3.      Arguments in favour of a change cited by the Secretary of State for education and Science are -(i)  The price of school meals has not increased since 1957, when itwas fixed at 1/-.    Meanwhile the cost of the meal has increasedby 25 per cent.    In consequence, the share paid by the parenthas fallen from 50 per cent to 37jr per cent, while the share paidby the Exchequer has risen from 50 per cent to 62&quot;! per cent.(ii)  The minimum proposal that v/e should restore the 1957 position,when the parents  share was 50 per cent, would raise the price to the parent from 1/-  to l/4d and would achieve an annualsaving in Exchequer subsidy of  11 million in 1966-67 rising to 13 million in 1969-70,    The Secretary of State for education and Science would much prefer to make a small increase in theparental share.    Thin would go up from the 1957 figure of50 per cent to 57 per cent, if the price to the parent were raised to l/6d and would give an estimated saving of  15 million in1966-67 if introduced in April, rising to  19. 5 million in 1969-70.(iii)  There seems no valid reason why parents should pay a lower sharetowards the cost and the Exchequer a higher share during aperiod when real incomes have risen substantially.    It goescounter to both common sense and socialist principle to raisethe proportionate subsidy as people become better off.    Thepolicy of pegging the charge to the parent at the 1957 level means that the Government is taking a concealed decision each year toincrease this particular subsidy.&amp; 3 a document IS THE PROPERTY OF KER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

(iv)  The constant rise in the number of schoolchildren and the increasing popularity of the meal means a mounting bill for theExchequer.    The net cost of school meals to the Exchequer has risen from  37 million in 1957 to  75 million in the current year, and if no change is made in the price and the percentageof children taking the meal continues to increase from itscurrant level of 65.4 per cent to an anticipated 73. 5 per cent the bill could rise to  94 million in 1969-70.(v) Average weekly earnings have increased since 1957 by 55.6 percent.    A dinner charge of l/6d represents an increase of only50 per cent over the charge of 1/- fixed in 1957.    The proportionof family income spent on school dinners would therefore stillbe less than in 1957, even more so with a charge of l/4d.(vi)  With the Gabinet&apos;s agreement the Secretary of State for education and Science is allowed under the PESO exercise to use savings on school meals for improving other parts of the educationalservice.    With the amount that he would save he could makesignificant improvements, e.g. increasing the minor works programme in respect of slum or sub-standard primary schools.In his view this has a higher priority than maintaining the presentprice for echool meals.Arguments against the increa.se4-.       The Secretary of State for Scotland advancer: three main arguments against the principal proposal - the 6d increase.    These - and the counterarguments of the Secretary of State for Education and Science - are setcut below -(a)    It would be wrong to make any fundamental change (as would be involved in increasing the percentage of parental contribution)until the whole pattern of family support, of which the school meals subsidy is an important part, has been fully studied by theGovernment in the course of the general review which is beingcarried out.    This study may well suggest radical changesconcerning, for example, family allowances and help-in-kind,but they cannot at this point be predicted, and it would be unwise to anticipate them.    Even an interim adjustment to restore theparents1 contribution to the 1957 level will inevitably have animmediate impact on those families having to pay the full increase.The Secretary of State for Education and dcience has ascertained that a social survey to establish the significance of the schoolmeal in family nutrition would take two years, and assumes that the Government study of family needs as a whole will not beready in less.    He would not propose a radical reshaping of thewhole School Meals Service in advance of the completion of theGovernment study, but thinks it reasonable meanwhile to make this interim adjustment in order to have money available for moreimportant things.

*These wage limits are based on average weekly household expenditure as given in the Family Expenditure Survey of 1964.    In deciding whether a family qualifies for free dinners the actual current outgoings on certainfixed items, e.g. rent, etc., are taken into account.    Thus, the grossincomes of families entitled to free dinners will differ somewhat from case to case.-3-C ON FIDE NTIAL9 a r:fc/    *J^b)    An increase cf 6d a meal would impose a real burden on a great many families who do not qualify for free meals (or even someremission of the full charge).    Assuming a consequential adjuct-rnent in remission scales, for a typical family with three children at school, free meals would be available for all the childrenwhere the gross weekly income was less than  14. 16. Od. (inScotland  14. 13. 3d.), but the full cost at the new rate for allthe children (22/6d a week) would become payable where thogross weekly income exceeded  15. 11, Cd. ( 16. 9, 6d. inScotland).    Ji the increase were 4d the full charge would become payable for a 3-child family where the gross income was 15. 8. 6d. ( 16. 6. 9d. in Scotland). *The Secretary of State for Education and Science, in reply,recognises that the impact of the increased charge will be feltmostly by families with incomes just above the level at whichthe full charge becomes payable, but, as with any other socialbenefit based on a test of income, there is bound to be a dividingline determining entitlement or otherwise.    In the case of theschool dinners this has long been accepted without criticism asbeing the level of income which does not fall below national assistance level after payment of the dinner charge.(c)    The sharp increase proposed would be politically inopportune.    Itis very doubtful if any method of presentation could overcome the adverse effects involved.    The method suggested by the Secretaryof State for Education and Science might well provoke dismaythat raising the school meals charge appeared to be the only wayof further financing school improvements.    The increase wouldbe out of step with other current measures to protect lowerincome groups: for instance, the intention announced by theGovernment of lessening the injustices of the rating system inthe interests of the lower income groups.    While savings on school meals could be used with advantage elsewhere in theeducation service, this should not outweigh the objections to increasing the charge now in the way proposed.    The proposal should be examined only in the context of family support generally,and, until this has been done, no substantial change should bemade inthe meals charge.The Secretary of State for Education and Science believes that theGovernment could lessen any political impact by linking the changenot only with a small improvement in the quality of the meal, butalso with a clear statement that as a result of this saving morewill be spent on improving sub-standard schools.    Moreover, he believes that the experience of the last twelve months has beenthat individual actions, whether immediately popular or unpopular,have practically no effect on voting attitudes;  compare, forexample, last year&apos;s increase in pensions and abolition ofprescription charges.    The Governments popularity goes up and down according to the total impression which it is giving of firm and effective government.

5.       The argument was not between the two Secretaries of State alone:,others joined in and the Committee were on balance hesitant about theproposed increase.conclusion. A decision is required on which of the following three courses wecould adopt -(a) To increase the charge for school meals to l/6d. i.e. to cover the increase in cost since 1957 and to raise the parents  shareof the cost of the meal from the 50 per cent as it was in 1957to 57 per cent.(b) To increase the charge to l/4d. i.e. to restore the parents&apos;share of the cost of the meal to 50 per cent as in 1957.(c) To do nothing at present.D.H.70, Whitehall, S.W.I.10th December, 1965-A.
