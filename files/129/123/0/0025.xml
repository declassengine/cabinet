Js DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &quot;S GOVERNMENT)66C. (65) 175 COPY NO.8th December, 1965CABINETNEGOTIATIONS FOR A FREE TRADE AREA AGREEMENTWITH THE IRISH republic memorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations we have now been negotiating with the Irish Republic steadily for about a year and. since Mr. Leniass visited London on 26th July, havevirtually completed the drafting of a Free Trade Area Agreement and aseries of connected documents.     There are only about a dozen points of substance on which agreement has still to be reached, but some ofthese are of considerable difficulty.2.     A team of senior Irish officials are in London this week for negotiations with our officials and Mr. Lemass, accompanied by someof his colleagues, will be here on 13th and 14th December.    It is hopedon both sides that at these meetings the negotiations can be concluded.Indeed, if all goes well, arrangements exist for the documents to be signed on the day after the agreements are concluded and for a white paper (which would consist of some 50 pages) to be published on thefollowing day.3.     I attach at Annex A a summary of the proposed Agreements,They would constitute a Free Trade Area fully consistent with theprovisions of the GATT,       covering virtually all the trade in both directions in agricultural as well as industrial items, but subject to special provisions on some items.4,      I also attach, at Annex B, a list of the outstanding points whichwill probably remain to be settled  with Mr. Lemass on 13th December.5,      The Governments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, theUnited States and EFTA countries have been kept informed in general terms of these negotiations.     The attitude of all of them has been inprinciple sympathetic.    We may have a little difficulty with someEFTA Governments on particular points, but we believe that there willbe no serious effect on our relations with thern.      We ha.ve been muchhelped by Mr. Lemass&apos;s public statements that, after the conclusionof a Free Trade Area Agreement with the United Kingdom, the irish republic could consider joining EFTA.     We expect no difficulty with commonwealth Governments, even though the Irish Republic compete with Australia and New Zealand in dairy products and meat.-1CON FIDE confidential 

6.      The initiative in this negotiation has come from the irish republic.     Their objective is to join the European Economic Communitybut they realise that this is impossible unless the United Kingdom alsojoined.    Meanwhile Mr. Lemass believes that the Republic cannot continue its present system of highly protected industries supplyinga small market and hopes that, if the Republics tariffs against theUnited Kingdom are lowered, Irish industry will be forced to be efficient and improve their exports to all destinations.    In return theRepublic wish primarily for a more assured market in the UnitedKingdom for their growing agricultural production.7.     It is difficult to estimate the balance of economic advantage which the two countries may expect to derive from the Agreements asthey are emerging.    Something turns, for both sides, on thesettlement reached on the points still outstanding.     On our side, atthe end of the ten-year . transitional period we might expect our exports to benefit from the Agreement to the extent of between 15 million and  25 million per annum (over and above any natural growth).     On the other side of the account there would certainly be some increase in our industrial imports from the Republic,particularly of man-made fibre goods and of agricultural products,but some part of these increases may replace imports which we shouldotherwise have made from third countries.    In addition, on the Irishside, the concessions which we have offered on store animals and meat may benefit the Republic, on our best estimate, by anythingbetween  5. 75 million and  8 million a year.    These figures are not comparable with the estimate above of the possible benefit to us,because it is reasonably certain that they will accrue, and the major part will be paid from the outset of the Agreement, whereas what were/ill be getting will be opportunities increasing over 10 years, of whichit would be for our exporters to take what advantage they can.    Ingeneral, what is in prospect looks a fair economic bargain to bothside s.8.     It would also have a political importance.    The disappearance of old leaders in the Republic and the increasing prosperity there have introduced a new realism into Irish politics.     There is a readiness toput less emphasis on the issue   of Partition and, particularly amongthe growing middle class and the business leaders, to accept theeconomic interdependence of the Republic and Britain.     There is an active desire to improve our mutual relations.    The establishment ofa Free Trade Area could help Mr. Lemass in his efforts to loosen upthe Irish economy, should further increase prosperity in the republic and should hence help the favourable development of opinion.    Indeed,an Agreement could place our political relationship with the Republicon a better footing than ever in the pa.st.    There is a general expectation in both countries that an Agreement will be concluded and,if negotiations now broke down, a difficult situation would arise for both sides.    Although the Irish are being very demanding on a numberof points, if a breakdown took place in circumstances in which theycould represent the British Government as having been ungenerous,there could be a krevulsion of feeling in the Republic,-2-

9.      Public comment in this country on the prospect of thisAgreement has been generally favourable.     There will be comecomplaints from sections of industry and agriculture which considerthat their interests will be adversely affected; this is inevitable withany arrangements which diminish protection.     But the reduction ofproduction on the Irish side will be far greater and the oppertuinities which this will afford for our industrial exporters should provide asufficient answer.10.     The Sub-Committee on External Economic Policy of the ministerial Committee on Economic Development considered thematter on 6th December, and agreed the line we should take on the issues listed in Annex B and on some other outstanding points whichofficials will probably be able to settle.11.     The discussions now in progress with Irish officials make itclear that Mr. Lemass will be very resistant to our proposals on cotton textiles and rules of origin (see points (a) and (b) in Annex B).Indeed, if we cannot go some way to meet the Irish on these issues,the negotiations may break down.    On the other hand, if v/e cansettle them, there is good hope of agreement being reached on theother issues.12,.    I recommend that the Cabinet -(a) Approve, subject to the settlement on satisfactoryterms of the outstanding issues, the conclusion ofthe proposed Agreements with the Government ofthe Republic of Ireland.(b) Leave to the Prime Minister, in consultation withthe other Ministers who will be engaged in thediscussions with Mr. Lemass, discretion on the outstanding issues, in the light of the negotiations.A.

ANNEX ASUMMARY OF THE AGREEMENTSExisting position at present we take approximately 10% of the irish republic&apos;s exports, and they take about half their totalimports from the United Kingdom,,    Trade is running; at about 170 million annually both ways.    Our exports to theRepublic are approximately 85% industrial goods and 15%agricultural products.    The Republic&apos;s exports to us areroughly in the proportion of one third, industrial goods to two thirds agricultural products.    The general tradingrelations between the two countries are governed by the angle-Irish Trade Agreements of 1938, 1 9h8 and 1960,    Underthese, broadly,  the Irish are able to send us about 93?^of their experts free of United Kingdom tariff and other restrictions, while about two thirds of our exports to the mare similarly free.    Beth sides give each other preferential treatment over a wide range of goods, and in addition, Irishstore animals are entitled to qualify for payment of theBritish Patstock Guarantees after three months residencein this country, subject to an abatement of fd, a poundin respect of store lambs.New Agreements2o      (a) IndustrialWe would remove our protective duties on thesmall number of Irish Industrial products8*8221 subject to them.    There would be special arrangements covering trade in cotton textilesoriginating in low cost countries.    For goodson which duties are being removed, safeguardswould be provided in the form of rules of/origin

origin against the Republic being used asa back door1 for industrial exports intoBritain from third countries.      On their side,  the Irish would remove their tariffs on British industrial goods by 10 annualcuts of 10/o, and would, also eliminate quotas,in most cases, at once.    V/e are likely to gain new de facto preferences over third countries as Irish duties come down althoughour existing guaranteed preferences overthird countries will disappear.    There wouldbe provision for the Irish to withdraw afew items from free trede after 5 years wherespecial difficulties had occurred,,    TheIrish would be allowed to retain theirpresent system of export tax incentives fora period of years.    The effect of these arrangements would be to place the UnitedKingdom in a more favourable competitive position in the Irish market which has been growing at about &quot;]% per annum.    For their part?  the Irish gains in the industrialsector would be very largely confined, to increased opportunities for exports of goodscontaining man-mad. e fibres and some of theirinefficient industries will go out of businessWe would give the Irish assurances thatunrestricted and duty-free access for&apos;their agricultural produce to the UnitedKingdom would continue indefinitely0    We could/however

however, impose restrictions, except onstore animals, as part of an inter-governmental commodity agreement or otherarrangement   for the purpose of orderlymarketing hut subject to conditions onaccess for Irish produce.    We would retain our import controls on main crop potatoesand the existing arrangements for bacon,cereals and sugar would continue,    Irishbutter would remain under quota, but theirquota will increase and there would be provision for its growth.    We would reducethe waiting period for their store animalsfrom three months to two months, andabolish the differential on sheep (seeparagraph 1 above): the effect would beto increase the attractiveness&apos; of the United-Kingdom market for Irish store animals,    Wehave offered to pay annually the equivalent of our guaranteed prices on 25,000 tons of irish carcase beef and 5?00*5 tons of Irishcarcase lamb in order to help safeguard the Republic&apos;s meat-packing industry fromdiversion of supplies, which gives the Irishcompensation in the agricultural field forthe balance of the industrial arrangements being in our favour.    The Irish wouldexclude from free trade on their sidecertain agricultural, horticultural and food commodities and on these our exports would still face tariffs and quantitativerestriction a,Taut the Irish would undertake/to

to aim not to reduce our opportunities forexporting these commodities to the republic and to consult us if they wanted to reduce our access to their market.general there will be the usual safeguards forbalance of payments difficulties, etc.:and provision for consultation.    Subjectto our approval in each instance, theIrish may reduce mere speedily theirtariffs in favour of Northern Ireland on particular items.

tC ... &quot;ANNEX. BOUTSTANDING ISSUESThe following are issues which may h?ve tc be settled personallywith Mr. Leaass, although it is hoped that sone of them will besettled or redused in scope at the meeting between officials now inprogress and that others will not be pressed by Mr. Lemasst-(a)    Cotton Textiles,,     The Irish are ready to restricttheir exports to the United Kingdom of cloth and made-up goods containing material imported by zheRepublic from low cost producers (which constitute the bulk of their exports of cotton textiles to us)ana. also their experts of cotton yearn.     Therewill of course be no restriction on their exportaof cloth and made-up goods manufactured frommaterial of United Kingdom origin,     &apos;7e have ashedthem to accept a restriction on our imports fromthe Republic of cloth and made-up goods manufacturedfrcm material of Irish origin or from material from countries whose exports to the United Kingdom willnot be under restriction, if in either case their exports to us in these categori 5s grow at an excessive r^te.The Irish regard our proposals as inconsistent with a Free Trade Area.     They argue that theyshould be as free to send to Britain goods madeof say Swedish or American cloth as we would beto send such goods to them and they contest evenmore strongly the idea that their trade in goodsmade from genuinely Irish material should be under any restriction.     Our difficulty is that theextent to which we appear not to restrain imports/fromCONFIDENTIALN

from a growing source like the Republic,increases the problem of securing general acceptance of our import control scheme as a whole.     In particular, we wish tonegotiate some restriction on our importsof cotton goods from Portugal, despiteour E.F.T.A. obligations, and this would bedifficult unless the Irish agree to somerestraint.     The Irish on their side claim that, unlike Portugal, they are not lowcost producers and should be treated like other E.F0T.A, countries,(&quot;b)       ^he^ Rples^of Origin.     Our concern is to devise rules in line with those inE.F.T.A. which will prevent back doorimports from third- countries.     The Irishfear that the rules which we think necessarywill deprive them of some of the benefitsthey expect from the elimination of ourtariffs on goods containing man-made fibres.(c) T^i^mijiajion J^f^exisjcing Trade /^reements 0The Irish are resisting our desire to retainfor a period of years our existing right toa preference of not less than -\0% where theylicense imports duty free or at a reduced rate.(d) Ipive^Year Review,     The Irish wish to havea greater freedom than we have felt able to concede, to exclude from the scope of theFree Trade Area in five years1  time itemsproduced by sensitive Irish industries whichrun into difficulties./(e)
