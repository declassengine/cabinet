C. (65) 183 COPY N0.6J520th December, 1965CABINETFAIRFIELDS SHIPYARDMemorandum by the First Secretary of State anaSecretary of State for Economic AffairsPresent Situation at FairfieldsThere is a great deal of uncertainty in the yard. The Receiverhas managed to persuade the Committee of Creditors not to take actiontowards liquidation for a few days.2..     Reardon-Smith are proceeding with their discussions with foreignbuilders, but will not take any irrevocable decision without firstinforming the Department of Economic Affairs in the hope that the yardcan be saved.3.      The Receiver has written to say that he cannot hold the positionbeyond this week.Progress of Financial Negotiations4.     It has always been the intention to find an important industrialistwith interests in Scotland to come in jointly on a fifty-fifty basis with theGovernment.5.     Sir Isaac Wolf son offered his participation through the Chancellorfor a fifty-fifty company.    When it came to completing arrangementshe decided that he could not proceed.6.      On his return from the West Indies, Lord Thomson and hissenior colleagues expressed interest.    Negotiations proceeded to apoint where Lord Thomson was prepared to contribute for half the equity of  1. 5 million, a loan of half a million pounds being madeavailable by the Government, and a conditional agreement having beenarranged with the Receiver for the purchase of the assets of the yard(see Annex for details of arrangements with the Receiver ). Anannouncement was about to be made in the House.    At the last minuteLord Thomson was persuaded by his junior colleagues on the Board andhis financial advisers not to go ahead.7. Thus, after sixteen days spent in abortive negotiation, we hadtwenty-four hours in which to find an alternative before the time limitset up by Reardon-Smith expired at the close of Friday, 17th December.-1-eDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

8.     Mr. Harold Lever, M. P. , and Captain Robert Maxwell, M. P.were anxious to help in any way they coulda but this was eventuallythought impractical for political reasons.    However, at a meetingattended by Mr. Lever and Captain Maxwell as well as national officials of the six more important Unions concerned, on Friday evening, theunion representatives expressed their willingness to try to persuadetheir executive committees to make an equity investment in Fairfields.9.      The only remaining possibility of a Government partnership now appears, therefore, to be a consortium of up to five separate interests,to contribute  -f million equity as in the proposed arrangements with lord Thomson.    At the present time this might be made up as follows:-Iain Stewart &amp; Associates  15 0, 000Lord Thomson 15 0,0003ir Isaac Wolf son 15 0, 000The Trade Unions 15 0,000Another syndicate 15 0,000This would purchase Fairfields shipyard (but not Fairfield-Rowan)from the Receiver for  2 million (and provide sufficient normal working capital: but, like any other, the new company would need cover for any additional temporary requirements for working capite.1 fromtime to time.    This could be provided by a commercial bank but Ithink it would be better to provide for drawings up to  f million forthis purpose from the Treasury).Alternatives available10.     There thus appear to be the following alternatives:(i)     (a)   To proceed on the basis outlined in paragraph 9 as follows:  iD-Government . 75Consortium (including Trades Unions) . 75Loan capital provided by theGovernment , 50  2. 00 million(b)   If  . 75 million is not forthcoming from non-Governmentsources (but &amp;\ million is), to reduce the total equity to  1 million and increase the loan capital supplied by theGovernment to   1 million.(ii)     Total nationalisation, which is unlikely to get satisfactorysupport from either the shipbuilders or the shipowners andit may thus prove difficult to run the shipyard as a viablecommercial concern.(iii)     Inform the Receiver that every effort has been made without success, in which event he will be forced to close the yard.-2-a 6

11.     If my colleagues agree to (i) in principle, I will make one finaleffort to achieve this before the end of this week.    If not, I am notmyself attracted by alternative (ii) and I think I should announce todayto the House that we have failed to save the yard despite the moststrenuous efforts.G. B.Department of Economic Affairs, S. W, 1.20th December, 1965-3-

anne:Arrangements with the ReceiverShortly before the announcement that Lord Thomson was coming in for half the equity, a conditional agreement was made withthe Receiver to acquire the fixed assets, stores and work in progressof the shipbuilding company for   1. 9 million.    This figure was basedon a valuation commissioned jointly by the Receiver and theDepartment cf Economic Affairs for the fixed assets and a certificatefrom Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co. for the stores and work inprogress.    The valuation gave the value on break-up of  , 79 million and on the sale as a going concern assuming a return to profitabletrading conditions within a period of five years of  1. 855 million.The Receiver obviously expected an offer between these two figures,but in practice the chances of his obtaining an offer from anyone elseat the higher figure was remote.    Yards which closed down recentlyhave been realising substantially higher figures than was expected and,therefore, the offer had to be somewhat above the break-up value andone which the Receiver was able to defend if challenged.    The offer of  1 million for the fixed assets was supported by Mr. Leach ofPeat, Marwick, Mitchell.    The stores and work in progress wereassessed ?.t  . 859 million by Peat, Marwick, Mitchell,    As soon asthe assets have been acquired and the rights to the contracts havebeen transferred there is  1. 3 million due to be paid in respect ofpayments on account from shipowners.2. There are losses for tax purposes of approximately  1. 9 million for the shipyard, which will be inherited by the new company.3.       The Receiver has been informed that the Government will notbe able to acquire any of the assets of Fairfield-Rowan, theengineering subsidiary company.     The Receiver will endeavour to sellF airfield-Rowan as a going concern.20th December, 1965-4 -
