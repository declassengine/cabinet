confidential annex AVIEWS OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR defence the minimum conditions on which the Secretary ofState would agree to a reference of the pay of the armed forces to the N.B.P.I. are as follows:-(i)      The terms of reference should &quot;be such as toallow the Board to give an honest answer tothe questions placed &quot;before them within amonth.(ii) The terms of reference should also &quot;be sodrafted as to invite a finding by the Board on whether the prima facie needs of the armed forces require special treatment in accordancewith some or all of the criteria laid down inthe White Paper on Prices and Incomes.(iii) The initial guaranteed offer should he atleast half of what is known to be the resultof the review under the Grigg system, namely9jr per cent.(iv) The Chancellor of the Exchequer should agree inadvance to accept the recommendation of theBoard.(v)     The analogous cases of the pay of the higher civil Service and of Doctors should also be remitted to the Board.

ft irjVIEWS . OP. THE PmST, JIlCj^TARYAND. THE, CH^IC^LQR OP. TEE exchequer we considered this natter further after theSecretary of State for Defence had left the meeting in order to fulfil another engagement.   Our views onthe points made by the Secretary of State arc asfollows(a) We see no possibility of the Board making itsreport in as short a time as one monthi but,as we indicate below, we think part of the reference could be dealt with within two months.(b) We cannot accept that the initial guaranteedoffer should exceed 7 per cent. (i.e. the norm)(c) We should be willing to discuss further theproposal that the Chancellor should agree inadvance to accept the finding of the Board.(d) We do not regard the proposal that the pay ofthe Higher Civil Service and of Doctors shouldbe referred to the Board as being particularlyrelevant.Despite the reactions of the Secretary of State for defence we adhere to the alternative solution which we put to him.   We therefore propose that a reference shouldbe made immediately to the Board in accordance with thedraft at Annex C.We would recommend that, in the first instance,the Board should be asked to consider whether, and towhat extent, increases additional to an interim increaseof 7 per cent, on 1st April 1966 should be made then or

later in the pay of the Armed Forces.    Informalenquiries which we have made of the Board indicatethat this part of the reference could he dealt withwithin two months.The review by the Board of the arrangementsfor determining the pay of the Armed Forces in the longer term could he dealt with by the Board at amore leisurely pace.

ARMED SERVICES* PAYANNEX   0DRAFT TBRH8 OF REFERENCE TO TEENATIONAL BOARD FOR PRICES AND INCOMES8 3*The pay of the Armed Forces has &quot;been reviewed at two-yearly intervals since I960.   The next reviewis due to take effect on 1st April, 1966.The formula at present used to determine the increases due under these reviews is set out in cmnd. 9U5j dated E&apos;ebruary I960, viz., &quot;It has beenagreed that changes in the pay of Service Officersv/ill in future be governed broadly by the relativechanges in the pay of comparable grades in the HoneCivil Service&quot; i.e,, the Executive and Administrativegrades: and &quot;It has been agreed that in future changesin the pay of ratings, soldiers and airmen will be governed broadljr by changes in the average earnings and v/ages in manufacturing and certain other industries as notified by the Ministry of Labour&quot;.The Government are concerned to establish whetherthis system can still be regarded as an appropriate method of determining the pay of the Armed Forces havingregard to the considerations in Part I of the White paper on Prices and Incomes (Cmnd2639) and their relevance tothe need of the Services to recruit and retain on a voluntary basis sufficient men to meet the commitments of the Services and the special features of Service life and emoluments.   In particular, they wish the Board toconsider, first, whether, and to what extent, increasesadditional to; the interim increase of 7 per cent on1st April 1966, should be made then or later in the pay of the Armed F^orces, and secondly, what the arrangements

for determining the pay of the Armed forces should be in the longer term.   The Beard are accordingly requested to report on these issues.
