THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1965C (65) 184 Copy No.     6 621 st December, 1965CABINETLEASEHOLD reform memorandum by the Lord President of the council the proposed scheme in our Election Manifesto we said &quot;Labour will ... changeleasehold law to enable householders with an original lease of morethan 21 years to buy their own houses on fair terms &quot;. The QueensSpeech at the beginning of this Session promised &quot; legislation to reform the leasehold system for residential property in England andWales, including provision for leasehold enfranchisement&quot;.2. The Ministerial Committee on Legislation on Rent, land commission and Leasehold Enfranchisement has worked out ascheme, on the basis of proposals put forward by the Minister ofLand and Natural Resources, with the following principal features:(1) A qualified leaseholder should have the right to:&apos;   (a) a 999-year extension of his lease at a modernised groundrent; and(b) the right to enfranchise at the market value of the freeholder^interest, as reduced by id).Both rights would be exercisable at any time after the passage ofthe legislation, and not only at the expiration of the originallease, and they would apply to all future leases. The holder ofan extended lease would have the right to rebuild his house, butnot to develop the site.(2) The qualification for the exercise of both these benefits should be :ia) the leaseholder must hold an original lease of a house ofmore than 21 years at a ground rent (hereafter called along lease) which was either acquired when it had morethan 21 years to run or was obtained by gift or inheritancefrom a person who so acquired it;ib) the leaseholder must have been occupying the property ashis residence for at least three years;(c) the property must be below the limits of rateable value setfor the purpose of the Rent Act 1965, i.e.,  400 in Londonand  200 in the provinces;CONFIDENTIAL6404 a
(d) occupying leaseholders who were otherwise qualified wouldnot lose their qualification by reason of the expiration ofthe lease before the passage of the Bill. This implementsthe undertaking given by the Minister of Housing andLocal Government in the House of Commons on 8th December, 1964.(3) Enfranchisement for holders of long leases not qualified under (2)A person who has purchased a long lease when it had21 years or less to run should have the right to enfranchise at market value, but no right to a 999-year extension of the lease.If he does not enfranchise before the original lease expires hewill become a statutory tenant at a rack rent.(4) Rights reserved to the freeholder:(a) During the currency of the original lease the freeholdershould have the right to resist in the county court theexercise of the leaseholder^ right to enfranchisement orto the extension of the lease on the ground, familiar tothe county courts in the Rent Acts and the Landlord and tenant Act 1954, that he wants the property for occupation by himself or his family and would suffergreater hardship from inability to recover possession atthe end of the original lease than would the leaseholderfrom inability to exercise the rights conferred by thescheme.(h) In the event of a 999-year extension of the lease the freeholderwould be entitled(i) to have the ground rent brought up to date at intervals of 30 years;(ii) to redevelop on buying out the leaseholders interest,subject to arbitration jf the leaseholder wished toexercise his continuing right to enfranchise.(5) FlatsThe Committee consider that the proposals should not applyto flats or other property divided between occupying leaseholdersNo satisfactory basis for freehold ownership of flats will existuntil legislation can be passed to implement the recommendationsof the Committee on Positive Covenants Affecting Land (theWilberforce Committee), and this is not a topic with which wecan deal in the Leasehold Bill itself. Our Manifesto pledge wasin terms of houses, and we do not think that there is anyexpectation that tenants of flats will be enabled to enfranchise;few of them are as yet subjected to insecurity because the practiceof letting flats on long leases is of fairly recent origin.3. Since it will be some time before a Bill can be introduced,the Committee suggest that the Governments proposals should beoutlined in a White Paper to be published as early as possible in theNew Year. Before the White Paper can be drafted it is necessary tobring before the Cabinet two matters on which the Committee havebeen unable to reach agreement: the proposal to give holders of an
original lease acquired when it had more than 21 years to run a rightto an extension of the lease for 999 years, and the question whetherthe right to enfranchise or to an extension of the lease should runagainst public authorities. These questions are discussed below.The 999-year extension of the lease4. A majority of the Committee consider that it is appropriate to give the leaseholder the right to a 999-year extension of the lease ata modernised ground rent because (a) this will ensure that the price the leaseholder pays forenfranchisement, if he wishes to enfranchise, either before or after the expiry of the original lease, will not includethe value of the house which in social equity belongs tohim;(b) entitlement to a long lease will give security of occupation and a saleable asset (on which a purchaser could raise a mortgage) to the leaseholder who does not want to putdown a lump sum for enfranchisement; and(c) a   long   lease   provides   an   attractive   alternative   toenfranchisement for the owner-occupier on a managedestate. Landlords of some of these estates already offertheir tenants extensions of their leases to 999 years,admittedly on payment of a capital sum of premium, andwe should not offer a lesser extension than the goodprivate landlord already offers.5. Some members of the Committee are critical of the 999-yearextension, however, on the grounds that:(a) by giving a leaseholder an indefinite right to the use of theland and by greatly reducing in some cases the price ofenfranchisement it would effect a drastic- indeedconfiscatory transfer of property values. It would givethe leaseholder, at the expense of the freeholder, not onlythe value of the house (about which there is nodisagreement), but a considerable slice of the development value of the land. This goes well beyond what is necessaryto remedy the social injustice entailed when a house forwhich the leaseholder or his predecessor in title has paidreverts to the freeholder. Illustrations of the financial effect are given in the Annex.(b) this  transfer  of  values  will   benefit  in  particular  the leaseholder who does not want to remain in occupation and can therefore realise his gain by selling either the freehold or, if he does not want to enfranchise, the extended lease. He would in fact get something close tothe full profit without paying the freeholder anything,because he could get an extension to 999 years for nothingand then sell his lease at a price reflecting the additionalvalue to the purchaser of the right to enfranchise it after three years. But would-be future leaseholders, e.g., theyoung married couple wanting to buy a cheap leasehold,
will be worse off because the effect of the scheme will beto increase the price of leasehold housing for owner occupation;(c) redevelopment, whether by private or public developers, willbecome more expensive, since if the freeholder wishes todevelop (and he may well have bought the reversion ofthe leasehold for this purpose) he will have to buy back from the leaseholder the value transferred to him by thelegislation;(d) profit will be made not only by leaseholders who areoccupying. Investment leaseholders will be able to selltheir interests at enhanced prices as soon as their presentsub-tenants wish to change house;&apos;c) the proposals would make leasehold investment sounattractive that leasehold as a means of providing owner-occupied housing might well not survive.Public authorities6. Labour Party policy on leasehold enfranchisement did notoriginally contemplate that enfranchisement should run against public authorities. In &quot; Homes for the Future &quot; we said that tenants of &quot; alocal authority, Government Department or certain public corporations &quot; would not be entitled to purchase the freehold, but would be given the right to a further lease. This was followed in&quot; Signposts to the New Wales &quot;. But in September 1964 the party&apos;sHome Policy Sub-Committee decided that enfranchisement should extend to tenants of public bodies; this was announced in Notes forthe Guidance of Speakers, and a number of candidates are believed to have given pledges on the point. It was not specifically mentionedin the Manifesto.7. The case for allowing enfranchisement against public authorities is that:(a) the proposition that it is unjust that a house which the leaseholder has either provided or purchased at nearfreehold value should revert at the end of the base to thefreeholder applies with equal force whether the freeholderis a private landlord or a public authority, and it isdifficult to base our proposals on this proposition unless we apply it to all occupying leaseholders; we are agreedthat it ought not to apply to owners who do not occupy;(b) in some areas, particularly in South Wales, local authoritiesown scattered properties which they hold for investment. From the leaseholders point of view theyare indistinguishable from private freeholders of similarproperties in the neighbourhood. Consequently it isdifficult to justify discriminating between one leaseholderand another, the more so as the benefit conferred on the leaseholder within the scheme will be substantial;(c) that we are committed by the pledges given before theGeneral Election.
8.   On the other hand, it is argued that:(a) to  allow enfranchisement  against  public  authorities  is inconsistent with our policy of bringing land into public ownership; and that since we could not conceivably allowenfranchisement against the Land Commission it wouldbe absurd to allow it against ihe local authorities whoseoperations are complementary to those of theCommission;(b) that in the hands of responsible public authorities, who donot exploit their tenants, the leasehold system haspositive advantages: it enables estates to be laid outcomprehensively without waste resulting from privatedevelopment; it facilitates socially valuable experimentswith mixed estates combining owner-occupied and rackrented dwellings; provides for the proper management of estates and in due course enables them to becomprehensively redeveloped;(c) local authorities would strongly resist a proposal to alloweither enfranchisement or the compulsory extension of leases to 999 years to council tenants. Councils with a labour majority, in particular, would find it hard tounderstand why we appeared to be frustrating policies,which we have in some places urged upon them, of developing estates on long leases in the interests of thelocal community;(d) similar considerations apply to New Towns and to housing associations.9. It may be possible to reduce the area of disagreement bydistinguishing among the various purposes for which local authoritiespossess leasehold property; as an investment; to redevelop a particularsite for their own purposes when the reversion falls in; forcomprehensive redevelopment, as in a city centre; or for the creationof new leasehold housing estates. The case for exemption is not equallystrong in relation to all of these; nor are the objections to a right toan extended lease necessarily as strong as those to enfranchisement.Before these possibilities are examined further, however, it would be useful to have the preliminary view of the Cabinet on whether wecan defend either the total exemption of public authorities or their total inclusion, and if not in which direction a compromise should besought. There are a number of special problems, relating to universities, charities, the National Trust, the Crown Estates and theRoyal Duchies, which we can consider when the broad lines of policy have been settled.Alternative possibilities10. If the Cabinet were to consider that the proposals set outin paragraph 2 above went too far, particularly in relation to the999-year extension of the lease, the Ministerial Committee could
examine further alternative proposals which have been put to them.Briefly, these are: &apos;A. (i) to give the leaseholder of a lease acquired when it had more than 21 years to run a right to an extended lease ata modernised ground rent for a much shorter period, say21 or 50 years which would have some relation to theprobable life of the house and hence to the inequity whichit.is desired to remove but without the right to rebuild.The freeholder would be able to get possession forredevelopment during the extension of the lease on payment to the leaseholder of the value of his new interest which would include the existing use value of the house;(ii) to give the leaseholder who bought his lease with 21 years orless to run the right, as under paragraph 2 (3), to continue in occupation at a rack rent at the expiry of the originallease;(iii) category (i) would get enfranchisement at the market valueof the freeholders interest. Where there was little or nodevelopment value, enfranchisement would be relativelycheap; where there was development value the freeholderwould receive the full value of his development rights.Category (ii), who cannot claim to have either providedor paid for the house, would not have a right to enfranchise(but would have security of tenure). Or alternativelyB. (i) no fixed extension of the original lease for either category of leaseholder, both getting instead a statutory tenancy atthe end of the original lease at a modernised ground rent,or a rack rent, as the case may be. The freeholder to retain the right to repossession for redevelopment during thestatutory tenancy on payment of statutory compensation possibly a multiple of the rateable value, which would include the existing use value of the house;(ii) both categories of leaseholder to have the right toenfranchise during the original lease at the market valueof the freeholder^ interest, but the freeholder to beentitled to resist enfranchisement during the last year ofthe lease on proof of intention to redevelop at the end ofthe original lease, and, if successful, to pay the statutorycompensation, and at the leaseholder^ option to buyout the remainder of the lease at market value.11. Either A or B could be confined to leases given before aparticular date, either a current date or one related to the socialproblem at which the legislation is aimed. With or without a limitation of this kind they would not prejudice the continuation of the leasehold system in the future. The question whether eitheris to be preferred to the scheme outlined in paragraph 2 may dependon whether we consider that the leasehold system has a useful socialfunction in modern society, or whether we are content to see itdisappear as a feature of either private or public housing.
Privy Council Office, S.WJ,20th December, 1965.Conclusion12. The questions on which the Ministerial Committee seek the views of the Cabinet are:(i) is the scheme outlined in paragraph 2 and in particular the proposal for a 999-year extension of lease broadly acceptable?(ii) if so(a) should  it  apply  in  its  entirety  against  public authorities? or(b) should extension of lease, but not enfranchisement,apply? or(c) should an attempt be made to distinguish amongthe different categories of land held by public authorities?(iii) if the scheme in paragraph 2 is not acceptable as it stands,should either A or B in paragraph 10 be examined further?H. B.
annex the FINANCIAL EFFECT OF THE PROPOSALS INPARAGRAPH 2 OF THE MEMORANDUMWe have considered the typical cases of a small house such asis found in South Wales and of a medium-priced suburban-typehouse, in each case..on the alternative assumptions that there is, or that there is not, development value in the site; and we have looked at the values when the lease has different periods to run. By way ofillustration:(i) Small house; no development value; lease about to expireThe leaseholder^ interest under the present law is worth nil.The 999-year lease would give it a value of about  1,150.* the leaseholder could enfranchise by paying the freeholder about 250t and would then have an asset worth  1,500.(ii) Medium house; considerable development  value; leaseabout to expireThe leaseholder^ interest under the present law is worthnil. The 999-year lease would give it a value of about  3,000.*The leaseholder could enfranchise by paying the freeholder about 8,6501 and would then have an asset worth  12,000.(iii) Same as (/) except that lease has 30 years still to run the leaseholder^ interest under the present law is worthabout  1,065. The 999-year lease would give it a value of about 1,225.* The leaseholder could enfranchise by paying thefreeholder about  1351 and would then have an asset worth 1,500.(iv) Same as (ii) except that lease has 30 years still to run the leaseholders interest under the present law is worthabout  2,520. The 999-year lease would give it a value of about 3,425.* The leaseholder could enfranchise by paying thefreeholder about  3,800t and would then have an asset worth 12,000.* These figures are an approximate valuation of the 999-year lease as such,i.e., without taking account of the additional value of the inherent right toenfranchise it.t These figures assume that the leaseholder would be required to pay for thespecial value to him of &quot; marrying the interests &quot;.
