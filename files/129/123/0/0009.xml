CONFIDENTIAL - qk3HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT66C.(65) 159 COPY NO._24th November, 1965CABINETRATE REBATESMemorandum by the Minister of Housing ana Local government there are two points for consideration.     The first is the&quot;threshold&quot; - the amount of rates which is to be disregarded in the calculation of rebates.     The second is the income limit in the caseof a single person.2.       The overall aim of my scheme is to reduce the proportion of household income taken by rates in the case of the lower income groups.The Allen Committee found that, while taking an average of all income groups 2.6 per cent of household income went on rates, in the case ofthose with  6 to  10 a week the projjortion was 6 per cent and in thecase of those with less than  6 a week it was 8 per cent;  these are1963-64 figures - the proportions will have risen since.     The reasonfor having a threshold at all is to secure that for a given total cost ahigher proportion of relief is given to households with high rate billsthan to those with low rate bills.     But v/e cannot push too far in thisdirection without undermining the scheme, for tine poorest householdsdo not pay that much in rates, even though the proportion of incometaken is high.    (Households with less than  6 a week pay on averageabout  23.)3.      I originally proposed a figure of  5, but to meet the Chancellorof the Exchequer I offered to increase this to  6 10s. (2s. 6d. a week);this would save about  2 million a year at the expense of deprivingnearly 150,000 persons of rebates altogether and reducing the rebatesof the remainder.     To raise the threshold further to  7 10s. , as theChancellor suggests, might cut out a further 100,000 persons and saveanother  1 to  i&apos;r million.    But every time the threshold is raised itis the ratepayers at the bottom of the income ladder who stand to sufferthe biggest proportionate loss.4.       The Chancellor has singled out for special attack the incomelimit of  8 proposed for single persons, and argued that this is undulygenerous compared with the limit of  10 a week set for a married couple.    True, the differential of  2 a week is smaller than the differential between the National Assistance Board1 s basic scales for single persons and married couples, which is just under 50s.    But theAllen Committee showed that this is a group on whom rates pressparticularly hard.    Single person retired households in the  6 to  10 aweek class spent in 1963-64 almost 9 per cent of their income in rates,compared with the average of 6 per cent for ail households in thisincome group.    And over three-quarters of those concerned are of retirement age.    In other words they are largely widows or widow/erswhose housing costs have not shrunk with their incomes.    They are a class particularly deserving of assistance,CONFIDENTlALx

CONFIDENTIAL oo5.       To argue, as the Chancellor has done, that the rebate scheme must be too generous because it grants rebates to people whose rates are no higher than their income tax liability is to ignore altogether thefact that on average income tax takes a much larger slice of incomethan do rates.    Even if the single man with  0 a week and a  20 ratebill would only be left paying  10 a year in rates, mis would stillrepresent 2.4 per cent of his income - only just below the average forall householders;   and the average rate bill for this group is in factnearer  40 than  30.6,       The effect of cutting the income limit for a single person from 8 to  7 would be to save  2 to 2\ million and to exclude about150,000 households from rebates.    It is not worth it.R.. H. 3. C.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, 5,&apos;l7&quot;.l,24th November, 1965
