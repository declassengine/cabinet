LEASEHOLD reform memorandum by the Lord Chancellor, the Attorney-Generaland the Solicitor-GeneralThe memorandum by the Lord President of the Council(0.(65) 184) records that the Ministerial Committee was unable to agree on the proposal that, as part of the proposed legislation on leasehold reform there should be a right to a 999 year extension of the lease at amodernised ground rent and the right to enfranchise at the market value as reduced by this right of extension.    It seems to us that the objectionsto the proposal outlined in paragraph 5 of the Lord presidents memorandum are very serious.     The proposal goes considerably further than our public commitment and, because of the resulting serious dis-ruption of established property values, would prove intensely contro-versiah    We doubt that it would be possible to defend the 999 yearextension on any basis of principle, and believe that it should be possiblesubstantially to remedy the social mischief at which the legislation isaimed by methods which do not involve so drastic a transfer of propertyvalues and, consequentially, so steep an increase in the cost ofredevelopment (whether by private or public developers).Arbitrary Incidence of Loss and Gain2.       We do not dispute that the bargain creating the lease may in manycases have given the original freeholder little or no equitable claim tohave the house handed to him at the end of the lease.    Where the free-holder bargained to allow the use of his land, the payment he received for it (whether by way of cash payment or ground rent, ot both) willrarely, if ever, have been adjusted to the fact that he would also receive a building at the end of the lease.     Where the freeholder let a building,the price is likely to have equalled the full, or nearly the full, value ofthe house.    But, whatever the nature of the original bargain, in thecourse of time the proprietary interests will have changed hands at prices reflecting the freeholder^ reversionary right to the building.The reversion will have changed hands at prices including the value ofthe future possession of the house;  the house will have changed handsat a price reflecting the limited duration of the lease.     The nearer theend of the lease the larger the impact of reversionary rights on the price.The right of enlargement of the lease which is now proposed will in nearly every case operate in favour and against persons who have acquired their interests at a cost reflecting these reversionary righto.The freeholder will be deprived of something he has paid for;   the leaseholder will be given a benefit which he had not bargained for-.DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)660.(65) 185 COPY NO._21st December, 1965CABINET

3.       As the annex to the Lord Presidents memorandum indicates,the size of the benefit conferred on the leaseholder which is a com-paratively small amount where the lease has 30 years to run and the site has no development value, becomes a very considerable amountwhere the lease is ?.bout to end or there is a high development potential.The proposal to limit the rirdit of enlargement to leaseholders of anoriginal term of 21 years will go some, but not the whole, way to mitigate the blatant anomaly that the greatest benefits (i. e. at the veryend of the lease) may go to the leaseholders who bought the smallestinterest and paid least for it;   and it would be impossible to prevent theconverse anomaly, that the freeholder who had recently bought thereversionary rights at a high price (e. g. for redevelopment) would bethe hardest hit.    Inevitably the incidence of the gain or loss would be largely fortuitous.    Although some of the freeholders do not deservemuch sympathy, there are certain to be others who could enlistextensive and influential support.     Figures submitted to the ministerial committee indicated substantial holdings of leasehold reversions bycharities, universities, the Church Commissioners and public authorities.     They could no doubt muster considerable opposition to theproposals and support it by cases where ail the merit was on their side.Our Commitment4.       Cur public commitment, in The Queen&apos;s Speech, the LabourParty Election Manifesto and Ministerial statements, does not go beyondan undertaking&apos; to change the leasehold law so as to enable leaseholderswith an original term of more than 21 years to buy their houses on fairterms.     &quot;Fair terms&quot; is an elastic expression, but it would normally be under stood by a dispassionate reader as something approximating tothe market value.     That was the criterion put forward by the Minoritycf the Leasehold Committee (Leslie Hale, M. P. and Lynn Ungoed-Thomas, M.P.) who in 1951 advocated, leasehold enfranchisement againstthe majority of that Committee which rejected it.     This Minority Reportcontains the most thorough exposition so far published of the thinking ofLabour members on this subject and, although different methods of calculation have since that date been put forward in various private members&apos; Bills, v/e believe that the Minority Report still represents themost authoritative expression of Labour Party thought on this subject.y e are not aware that there has been any public indication that v/e arenow planning legislation on far more drastic lines.    What is nowproposed is a measure of expropriation of an unprecedented character.This is not a case where private property is taken over for the benefitcf the community.     This is a compulsory transfer between individuals.The proposal is that in each case, and there will be a large number ofthem, one property owner will be compelled by law to make a free giftto another property owner of a large part of his interest.    No-one has ever suggested that public authorities should acquire land in so confis-catory a manner.    Such legislation was never foreshadowed either inthe Election Manifesto or otherwise.     Indeed, it would quite certainly bemet with the objection that such a proposal was not even hinted at before or during the Election.The Alternatives.5.      We have given some thought to alternative proposals which would achieve our objectives.    We doubt that any form of extension of the leaseholder^ term provides a solution.    Any long-term extension rnu3tdrastically depreciate the value of the reversion, while a short extension-2-

CONFIDENT! ALsay for 10 or 15 years, would not do enough to alleviate fee existinggrievances; after a few years a leaseholder wanting to move would againfind his lease unsaleable, or nearly so, and a leaseholder who wasdispossessed for development would still get little compensation.6.       We appreciate that in some cases a right to enfranchisement atthe present market value of the freeholder&apos;s interest would not sufficientlymeet the leaseholder^ needs because the price would be more than hecould afford.     (The price would not, of course (unless the site was ripe for immediate development), be the full vacant possession value of feehouse.    Because of the impact of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954(which enables the leaseholder to stay on at the expiration of his leaseas a tenant under the Rent Acts) the value of the freeholder&apos;s interest is very much less than that.    For instance, for a house of  40 rateable value wife a vacant possession value of  1500, fee market price of feefreeholders interest might be approximately  550 at the end of the lease or, if the lease had 10 years to run, it v/ould only be  240, cr, if20 years to run,   120).    It may be that the position could be improved by providing for payment on easy terms:   the amount might, for ins-tance, become a mortgage on the property to be paid off over a periodof years.    If it is thought feat the leaseholder^ needs could not be met in this way, then v/e think feat alternative B in paragraph 10 of the lord presidents memorandum deserves serious consideration.     Thisproposal, which has the added advantage of simplicity, involves givingfee leaseholder security of tenure at an up-to-date ground rent and feeright to statutory compensation if he is displaced for redevelopment.There would still be some transfer of property values, but it would beless drastic than under fee other proposals, and it could be justified onthe ground that all that fee freeholder was entitled to v/ould remain his.The development potential could be reserved to him, and pendingdevelopment or possession he would receive a fair rent for the ground.7.       We accordingly ask our colleagues to agree that fee proposals in paragraph 2 of the memorandum of the Lord President go too far andthat further consideration should be given to enfranchisement at market value or on the lines of the Alternative B in fee memorandum.Lord ChancelIor&apos;s Office, S.W.1.21st December, 1965--1
