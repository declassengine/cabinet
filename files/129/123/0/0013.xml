I am examining urgently the action required to exercise control over the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia (see paragraph 3 of the note).-Li. J . C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.T,29th November, 1965SECRET

JL vPROPOSALS FOR INTENSIFIED FINANCIAL.MEASURES AGAINST rhodesia the following measures are proposed for consideration -(i)  No more payments from Rhodesian accounts to non-sterling countries, even for pre-zero commitments.    This reverses   a previousannouncement.    Most pre-zero commitments are running out, but there remains continuing items, e.g. servicing I. B.R.D. loans.    These areguaranteed by K. M. G. , but why should not Rhodesia provide ov/n dollars ?(ii)  Ban United Kingdom merchanting to and from Rhodesia, even forSterling Area trade.    Mer chanting is convenient for Rhodesia.(iii) Ban new United Kingdom insurance business with Rhodesia.Disadvantage:   other countries will pick up business.(iv) Mo transfers of Rhodesian security sterling from one Rhodesianto another.    This cancels previous announcements.    It would make itimpossible for a Rhodeoian holding United Kingdom securities to liquidatethem, even by sale to another Rhodesian.(v)  Apply the Dame rule to the securities held by Reserve Bank of rhodesia, i.e. deny facilities allowed to other central banks.    Thiswill make illiquid most of remaining Rhodesian reserves in UnitedKingdom.(vi)  No trading credit for United Kingdom exports to Rhodesia:   cashon shipment only.    (This does not arise if all exports are stopped anyway).(vii)  No cash gifts at ail by United Kingdom residents to Rhodesia.Cancels previous announcement of  50 limit.     Will be criticism overstopping Christmas gifts, and trouble over special cases.(viii)  No travel facilities for United Kingdom residents wishing to visitRhodesia, save in special cases.     Cancels previous announcement of 250 limit.    Cannot be policed perfectly, but offenders will be liable toprosecution.(ix)  No arrangements for any travel allowance or transfer of cashfor United Kingdom residents wishing to emigrate to Rhodesia.(x) No overdraft from London for United Kingdom banks operating in Rhodesia.    These banks to be warned that facilities are most unlikely to be forthcoming even to avoid a default.(xi)   -.7e take all possible steps to press for the immediate repayment of all overdrafts outstanding for Rhodesian residents with accounts at united Kingdom banks.    (No new overdrafts have been allowed anywaysince 11th November.)(xii)  No remittances by United Kingdom firms to subsidiaries andbranches in Rhodesia, except to pay for imports from those subsidiariesinto United Kingdom;  if these imports are banned, these paymentsstop too.This should have considerable impact in Rhodesia, and causedislocation and unemployment, at least temporarily.    Disadvantages:damage to long-term British interests, unpredictable psychologicaleffects, possible for Smith to keep production going by providing localfinance and possibly expropriation.-1-SECRET

(;ciii)  No payments by United Kingdom residents to ??Jiodesia in respectof pre-zero arrangements (e.g. child at school) which are not definitecontractual commitments.(xiv)  Temporary stop on contractual payments to Rhodesia, includingpensions, interest and dividends, insurance claims.    Announce thatthere is of course no question of repudiating such obligations, but theycannot be carried out until constitutional Government is restored.   Untilthen H. M.G. will hold pensions, interest etc. payable by H. M. G. insuspence account and advices other firms etc. to do likewise.This is a major and difficult step.    Disadvantages:  risk ofaccusation of default by H.M.G. and risk of retaliation by Rhodesiawhich financially would be on balance favourable to Rhodesia;  psychologicaleffects unpredictable.But the step should cause much inconvenience and hardship to individuals and by its very enormity should demonstrate H. M. G&apos;determination and have considerable impact.2.      The above measures do not include stopping payments for visibletrade.    The way to step imports and exports between Rhodesia and united King dim is by direct controls.    It would be illogical to take such measures as (xiv) above without also stepping visible trade.3.      In addition, it is proposed to take action under the SouthernRhodesia Act to exercise control over the Reserve Bank of Rhodesia.Two possibilities:   issue directions requiring the Bank to refer toLondon before using accounts in other countries; or dismiss and replace the Governor and Directors of the Reserve Bank by United Kingdomnominees, and direct them.    Both are feasible legally.   Both requireco-operation of other foreign bankers to make successful.    The second course (full control) would be more certainly effective, but it involvesaccepting responsibility for managing the day-to-day operations of theBank which will be difficult to exercise and may lead us into deep water.-2-
