DIPLOMA TIC RELATIONS WITH THE VATICANIvCemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe present position is that Her Majesty is represented at the holy See by a Minister, while there is no diplomatic representative ofthe Vatican in this country.    (The present Apostolic Delegate has nodiplomatic status, and is accredited only to the Anglican hierarchy).2.       In my memorandum of 31st March, 1965 (C.(65) 56), I invitedmy colleagues to consider a proposal to seek the approval of The Cue ento our suggesting to the Holy See that diplomatic representatives withthe rank of Ambassador should be exchanged.     Since that memorandum was written, it has been represented that acceptance of a Papaldiplomatic representative in London would be repugnant to some sectionsof non-Catholic opinion in this country, and that there might even be anoutcry against it.3.       One alternative and more limited proposal which we might con-sider is that the status of our Minister at the Koly See be raised to thatof Ambassador, without any change in the Vatican&apos;s representation here.The Apostolic Delegate has suggested to our Minister at the Holy Seethat it would be very welcome to the Vatican if v/e v/ere to raise ourLegation to an Embassy, even without accepting an envoy from the KolySee.    In any event, our Minister considers it unlikely that the Vaticanwould take the initiative in asking for the accreditation of a diplomaticenvoy to this country.    If such an envoy were eventually to be appointed,he would not be a full Nuncio (automatically taking precedence).    SuchNuncios are normally appointed only in predominantly Catholic countries there are some practical reasons in favour of this limitedproposal:(i)   The Holy See is now the only place at which we maintain aLegation, rather than an Embassy. This is an administrativeanomaly which I should like to see tidied up.(ii) At the Papal Court, where protocol is important, the juniorstatus of Her iv.iajesty&apos;s representative can be an inconvenienceto the proper discharge of his duties.(iii)  Furthermore, it seems inappropriate for him to rank eqtial,among others, with the representatives of San Marino, Ivionacoand The Order of Ivialta.    The other seven countries whichaccredit Ministers to the Holy See are similarly not of thefirst significance.    It is true that the United States, the Soviet-1-IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government.(65) 173 COPY NO.    666th December, 1965CABINET

Union and the old Commonwealth countries, i. e. the majornon-Catholic powers, have no diplomatic representation at ailat the Holy See.    But I am not sure that this is an argumentwhy our own representative (we have had one since 1914) shouldbe a Minister rather than an Ambassador.(iv)  Under the present Pope, as under his predecessor, the Vaticanis becoming a more important influence in world affairs in the promotion cf peace, disarmament, the war against poverty,and support for the United Nations.    These are goals whichare worthy of support, and the gesture of upgrading our representative at the Holy See might be appropriate on these grounds also.5.       On all these grounds there is a good deal to be said for the limitedproposal to upgrade the status of our present Minister at the Holy See tothe rank of Ambassador.    I recognise of course that there are alsofactors pointing in the other direction, notably the fact that the archbishop of Canterbury does not favour even this limited move.    Ishould greatly value the views of my colleagues in this matter.M, S.Foreign Office, S.W.I.6th December, 1965-2-
