THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet, November 1965C (65) 155 Copy No.    6 619 th November, 1965CABINETPUBLIC SCHOOLSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for education and ScienceFollowing a Cabinet decision of 13th July, (C.C. (65) 37thConclusions, Minute 4), The Queen&apos;s Speech states that &quot; a publis schools Commission will be set up to advise on the best way ofintegrating the public schools with the State system &quot;. This paper,which has been approved by the Social Services Committee, discussesthe terms of reference of the Commission and other related questionsDefinition of schools2. Our Election Manifesto and The Queen&apos;s Speech both speak of &quot; public schools &quot;. The only practicable definition of these (whichwas broadly that used by the Fleming committee ) is &quot; schools nowin membership of the Headmasters Conference, Governing BodiesAssociation or Governing Bodies of Girls&apos; Schools Association &quot;. Thisembraces, first, 276 independent schools (containing 95,500 pupils).Of these, 134 are boys (106 boarding 28 day), 142 girls (83 boarding-59 day).3. But it also embraces (in addition to 22 maintained schoolswhich I refer to later) 152 (out of 179) Direct Grant Schools, of which72 are boys (58 day 14 boarding) and 80 girls (79 day one boarding).I do not want these to come within the purview of the commission for the following reasons:(a) Many Direct Grant schools constitute too important a partof local education authority arrangements in their areas to be detached from the maintained school system and put under the Commission.(&apos;) &quot;the public schools and the general educational system &quot;. report of thecommittee on public schools appointed by the president of the board of education in july 1942. published 1944.CONFIDENTIAL6312 a\
(b) The Direct Grant schools pose a different problem from most of the independent schools. They are already insome sense part of the public sector; many of them areCatholic; and they are predominantly day schools,whereas two-thirds of the independent schools areboarding. Their inclusion would, therefore, distract theCommission from its main task of dealing with theindependent schools.(c) Above all, our overriding aim for the Direct Grant schoolsis that they should negotiate and agree directly with localeducation authorities their future place in localcomprehensive reorganisation schemes; and this is alreadybeginning to occur. But if we put them under theCommission, we shall provide the reluctant ones with aperfect excuse for not negotiating and for contracting outof local reorganisation schemes.(d) I am confirmed in this view not only by the opinion ofpro-comprehensive Directors of Education whom I have consulted, but also by the fact that the more eminentDirect Grant schools desperately want to come under theCommission.(e) On a minor point, the wider definition of all HeadmastersConference, Governing Bodies Association and Govern-ing Bodies of Girls&apos; Schools Association schools would be most untidy; for it would exclude 27 Direct Grant schoolswhile including 22 maintained schools.I therefore conclude that the Direct Grant schools must be treatedas a separate operation, as indeed they are treated in mycomprehensive Circular; and I would propose to exclude them byinserting the word &quot; independent &quot; in the definition though I wouldsound a further warning note to them at the same time as Iannounced the Commission.4. The definition also excludes a further 3,130 private schools.These schools do not present any urgent problem in this context;they were not mentioned in the Manifesto or The Queen&apos;s Speech;they could not possibly be dealt with in the next 2-3 years, being of enormous variety, usually very small and often denominational.I therefore propose to exclude them from the definition but to makea vague reference to them in the Commission^ terms of reference(see Annex).Tasks of the commission.   In pursuance of its general remit of advising on the best way of integrating the public schools with the State system, I proposethat the Commission should be entrusted with the following tasks:(a) To investigate: i.e., to collect and assess information aboutthe schools within its scope (which vary greatly in size and character) and about the need, and existing provision,for boarding education; and to examine possible formsof collaboration between the schools and the maintainedsector.
(b) To work out with local education authorities and schools the part which individual schools should play in national and local schemes of integration.(c) If it so wishes, and subject to my approval, to initiateexperimental schemes matching existing provision with different types of need.id) To recommend the basic principles of a national solution tothe problem of integration; whether this would needlegislation should be left open at this stage.Guiding principles6. I am sure that, without prejudging the detailed findings ofthe Commission, we must lay down certain broad guiding principles;otherwise the Commission might make recommendations which weretotally unacceptable to us. This was the line which we took in&quot; Signposts for the Sixties &quot;. The principles should reflect the following considerations:(a) The public schools represent a considerable educationalcapital; and, at a time of acute pressure on our resources,this should be used to meet the needs of the nation as awhole. In particular, since the schools are two-thirdsboarding and account for one-half of the country&apos;ssecondary boarding provision, the Commission should consider the boarding aspect first; that is, how the schoolsmight help to satisfy the &quot; need &quot; category along the linesdefined in the Martin report and, more widely, theneeds of other children whose home or neighbourhoodenvironment is prejudiced to their education.(b) Both for the reason given in (a) above, and in order to eliminate their devisive influence on society, the schoolsmust accept a socially mixed entry.(c) Moreover entry must represent a progressively wider range of academic attainment. We cannot turn each individualschool into a comprehensive school (many of them are much too small). But the public school sector as a wholemust increasingly conform with our comprehensivepolicy for the maintained sector. Now that we areabandoning the 11 -f in the maintained sector, wecannot perpetuate and indeed intensify academicselection for the public school sector.(d) The  local  education  authorities  are  themselves  quiteheavily involved in boarding provision, though in a veryunsystematic and unco-ordinated way. It is vital thatthe Commission^ work and recommendations shouldmarch hand-in-hand with what the local educationauthorities are doing.(&apos;) Report of the Working Party on Assistance with the Cost of BoardingEducation.

(e) Lastly, the State-sponsored entry should not be just a tinyminority we do not want a small-scale Flemingsolution. I am sure it would be wrong to lay down inadvance any particular percentages; but we should establish the broad principle that, in the long run, entry to these schools should not depend on parental income.7. I attempt in the Annex to embody these guiding principlesin the terms of reference.Size, finance and administration of Commission8. I envisage a Chairman (and possibly Deputy-Chairman) whowould be half-time and paid accordingly, and about 12 othermembers who would not be representatives but drawn from a numberof interested parties schools (maintained as well as public), localeducation authorities, universities, churches as well as one or twoindependent members. The Commission would be serviced by myDepartment.9. I estimate that the servicing of the Commission might cost 55,000 in a full year. The only other public expenditure for (say)two years would be the cost of pilot experiments perhaps  100,000in the first year and not more than  400,000 in the second; I would hope this might be borne by the local authorities. The cost of anyresearch needed for the Commission^ work would be borne on myDepartment^ research Vote. Once the Commission has recommended,the burden of expenditure will depend on (a) the rate of integrationwhich the Commission proposes, (b) whether the Government acceptsthis or not (as to which it is of course a completely free agent), (c) theextent to which local education authorities contribute towards the fees of the State-sponsored pupils, and id) the extent of the parentalcontribution on which we decide. None of this, as I explained to theCabinet on 13th July, will fall to be decided for 2-3 years.Other possible measures10. A number of other actions which the Government might take have been suggested from time to time. I have considered these and reached the following conclusions:(a) Application of the teacher quota system to the schools. Butit appears on examination that (allowing for boardingand larger 6th forms) the alleged superiority in staffingratios of these schools is rather small; any possible gainto the 6,000 State secondary schools would be negligible.Moreover, such a policy would need legislation, wouldbe onerous and costly to administer, and would createpointless resentment just at the moment when we want the maximum goodwill. I do not think, therefore, that thisis a worthwhile proposition. But the Commission shouldbe asked to consider the point.(b) Eliminating tax privileges. I am pursuing this point with theTreasury to see whether any action is possible or desirable in next year&apos;s Finance Bill.
(c) Abolishing relief from rates. The great majority of publis schools are charities and as such enjoy the same relief as other charities which do not receive University GrantsCommittee grant. It would be invidious to discriminate against them while others retained their present relief.(d) Persuading Oxford and Cambridge colleges to give fewerplaces to pupils from public schools and more to those from maintained schools. The Franks Commission isaware of this problem and I propose to await its findingsbefore pursuing the question further.Conclusion11. I invite my colleagues to endorse the terms of reference for the Commission which are set out in the Annex. (I understandthat the Secretary of State for Scotland would wish the Commissionto deal with Scottish schools coming within the definition.) I shall then proceed to appoint the Chairman and to make a statement tothe House.C. A. R. C.Department of Education and Science, W.I,18th November, 1965.AnnexTERMS OF REFERENCE OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLSCOMMISSION1. The main function of the Commission will be to advise onthe best way of integrating the public schools with the State systemof education.2. For the immediate purpose of the Commission publis schools are defined as those independent schools now in membership of the Headmasters Conference, Governing Bodies Association orGoverning Bodies of Girls Schools Association.3. The Commission will be expected to carry out the followingtasks:(a) To collect and assess information about the public schools(including their staffing ratio in comparison withmaintained schools); to study the need and existing provision for boarding education; and to examine possibleforms of collaboration between the schools (in the firstinstance the boarding schools) and the maintained system.(b) To work out with local education authorities and schools the role which individual schools might play in national and local schemes of integration.
(c) If it so wishes, and subject to my approval, to initiateexperimental schemes matching existing provision with different types of need.(d) To recommend a national plan for integrating the schoolswith the maintained sector of education.(e) To recommend whether any action is needed in respect of independent schools not now in membership of theHeadmasters Conference, Governing Bodies Associationor Governing Bodies of Girls Schools Association.4. In carrying out its tasks the Commission will be expected(while respecting the denominational character of many of the schools), to pay special attention to the following objectives:(a) To ensure that the public schools should make their maximum contribution to meeting national educationalneeds, and in the first instance any unsatisfied need forboarding education in the light of the Martin andNewsom Reports.0)(b) To create a socially mixed entry into the schools in orderboth to achieve (a) above and to reduce the divisiveinfluence which they now exert. .(c) To move towards a progressively wider range of academicattainment amongst public school pupils, so that thepublic school sector may increasingly conform with the objectives outlined in Circular 10/65.(d) To co-operate closely with local education authorities in seeking to match provision with need for boardingeducation.(e) To ensure the progressive application of the principle thatthe public schools, like other parts of the educational system, should be open to boys and girls irrespective ofthe income of their parents.(&apos;) Report of the Working Party on Assistance with the Cost of BoardingEducation.
