HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (65) 15622nd November, 1965COPY NO.DOCABINETTRIAL GENERAL SPEED LIMIT OF 70 M. P. H.ON ALL ROADSMemorandum by the Minister of transport at their meeting on 19th November, the Home Affairs Committeeendorsed the proposals which I had put to them for action to be takenfollowing the recent multiple crashes on motorways.    It was felt thatin view of the great public concern about this matter my colleagues would wish to know in advance of the measures which I intend to announce in reply.to several Questions that have been tabled for answer on24th November.2.      There are two main steps to be taken in the immediate future.The first is an ad hoc advisory speed limit of 30 m. p. h. for temporaryapplication on lengths of motorway when and where the weather conditions are specially bad.    These lengths will be indicated byflashing electric signs, displayed at the sides of the road, which thePolice will switch on and off as they consider necessary.     Plans are going ahead for physical preparations to be completed in time tointroduce the ad hoc limits just before Christmas.3.      The second measure is the introduction for a trial period of four months, through the winter and covering Easter, of a general70 m. p. h. limit on all unrestricted roads, including motorways,    It.will not be a major feature in dealing with fog hazards, though it has some bearing on them, and on other hazards due to bad local conditions.No direct evidence is available about the effect of introducing a speed limit of 70 m. p. h.     Nevertheless the Road Research Laboratoryadvise me that there is no doubt some reduction in both speeds and numbers of accidents can be expected.    In the United States, where the accident rate per vehicle mile is amongst the lowest in the world, allroads outside the cities are subject to a general limit, usually at shout70 m. p. h.    I have no doubt that we should take advantage of the presentmood to adopt the trial limit as a means of inducing higher standards ofdriver discipline generally and of persuading drivers here to accept theneed for restraining excessive speeds.    In consultation with the secretaries of State for Scotland and vValec, I shall review the resultsof the experiment in time to decide whether the 70 m. p. h. limit shouldbe continued at the end of the initial trial period of four months.

764.     Neither measure involves great cost, and my Department are intouch with the Treasury on all the details of the expenditure involved.The Local Authorities and other organisations mainly concerned havebeen consulted.    The 70 m. p. h. limit may attract criticism from someof the motoring interests, but in the pres ent circumstances I think It most unlikely that there will be any significant body of fundamentalopposition to the four months1 experiment.    This is an opportunity notto be missed and my aim is to take advantage of it in my statement tothe House on 24th November.Ministry of Transport, S. E. 1. ,19th November, 1965.-2-
