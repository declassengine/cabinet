IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)C.(65) 165 COPY NO. 6629th November, 1965CABINETFAIRFIELDS SHIPBUILDING AND ENGINEERING CO. LTD.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the First Secretary of State proposes in C.(65) 162 that we should decide now to buy out the Fairfields&apos; creditors and take over the yard.While I agree that our object should be to take the firm over, perhaps in association with private industry, I am sure it is essential that we should avoid taking on the encumbrance of the firm&apos;s present liabilities (whichcould be up to  8 million) and thus responsibility for bailing out the creditors. .2.      If we are to avoid paying a grossly inflated price for the firm as agoing concern v/e can only contemplate a take-over after bankruptcy, thusacquiring only the physical assets.    I am told this would be very difficultto achieve since during and after bankruptcy operations the yard wouldprobably have to close down, creating, apart from immensely tangledlegal questions, precisely the problems of labour wastage and unemployedplant, equipment and site which we are striving to avoid.    This leads meto consider whether a take-over might be arranged to take place more orless simultaneously with the declaration of bankruptcy at a price to bedetermined by arbitration.    This would have the obvious advantages ofcircumventing the need to negotiate with the creditors and preventing anyrunning down of activity.    It also has the attraction of leaving open thepossibility of flanking our stake in the enterprise with a contribution from private industry.    In this connection Sir Isaac Wolf son told me that he had spoken today to the Receiver to the effect that he was still interested in thepossibility of his (Wolfson&apos;s) participation, though he felt that the only means of keeping Fairfields going would be through a radical reconstruction,involving a new company and renegotiated contracts.    Sir Isaac &quot;Wolf son ismeeting the Receiver again on Thursday, 2nd December;  and I feel that itwould be desirable to await the outcome of this meeting before taking finalGovernment decisions.3.      I am advised that recourse to the arbitration solution outlined above would also present serious difficulties, but I think it merits very careful examination before we become committed to any of the alternatives,-li. J. C.Treasury Chambers, Si, W. 1.29th November, 1965
