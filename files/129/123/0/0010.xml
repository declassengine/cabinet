G (566THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF KER BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS GOVERNMENT)IIIC.(65) 1&amp;0 COPY NO._24th November, 1965CABINETRATE REBATESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer7/hen rate rebates were discussed by the Cabinet on 14thOctober, the Prime Minister indicated in his summing up that furtherconsideration should be given to the points raised in discussion on theadministration of the scheme, including the  5 level of minimum rateliability.    The questions now outstanding are -(a)    whether the &quot;threshold&quot; or minimum rate liability should be 6 10s. (2s. 6d. a week) or  7 10s. a year (3s. a week).(b)    whether the income limit for full relief for a single person should be  8 a week or  7 a week.2.       I must tell my colleagues that we are facing a difficult situation on the Estimates and on public expenditure generally, which will leadto a difficult Budget unless we can secure considerable reductions.There are, therefore, particularly strong grounds for securingeconomies wherever they can be got without undue difficulty.3.       The main purpose of this memorandum and of the attached tableis to get away from percentages and global totals relating to classes ofratepayers, and to show the effect of the alternative proposals in termsof their money impact on individual ratepayers.    It is this that willmatter in the House and the country.    The figures demonstrate that asmall difference in the amount of relief to individuals can make a bigdifference to the outlay of public money.4,       My proposals for the threshold and the single income limit would reduce the cost of the scheme to the Exchequer by  3 million -  4 million, and the cost falling on the rates by  1 million -  lj million.As the attached table shows, except in one case, my proposals wouldgive substantially the same relief as the Minister&apos;s.    The effect ofthe  7 10s. threshold, taken on its own, is to reduce the relief in eachcase by 13s. 4d. per year (or 3d. per week) on a bill of  10,  20 oreven  40 per year.    This cannot make any significant difference to theproportion of income taken in rates.     The only category much affectedis the single person who is a householder at or about  8 a week, and Iconsider there are good grounds for this (see paragraph 6 below).Taken as a whole, I do not believe that my proposals weaken the attraction of our scheme politically.    The previous Governments raterelief measures achieved little, and hardly afford the Opposition a base for criticism.-1-

SECRET - g5.       Cn the threshold, I do not believe that a minimum of 3s. aweek instead of Zs. 6d. is too high.     The Minister says a  7 10s.threshold might exclude 100, 000 people from relief, but these must bydefinition be people to whom he is proposing to give relief of 13s. 4d.a year only, or less.    And the 100,000 has to be viewed against a very rough estimate of t\ million beneficiaries in all.6.       On the income limit, I think the following figures bring out mypoint that the differential of  2 a week (H-25 per cent) between single and married is too small:-Single    Married      DifferenceIncome tax starting levels	 5 10	0	 8 10	0	 3  0	0 t+55%)Income tax &quot;age exemption&quot;						levels	 7 14	0	 12  0	0	 4 6	0 (4-56%)National Insurance Pensions	 4 0	0	 6 10	0	 2 10	0 (+62170)National Assistance Rates	 3 16	0	 6  5	6	 2  9	6 (+65VJ)I realise that the Allen Committee said that rates pressed particularlyhard on single retired householders.    However, they also said(paragraph 230):-&quot;The average income of ail retired single householders is only 314, 9 a year but more than three-quarters of them fall withinthe lowest income range where the average income is  234 ayear. &quot;They also showed (Table 314) that in their &quot;Special Study&quot; or specialhardship group only 12. 3 per cent had incomes of  350 and over, and four-fifths of this 12. 3 per cent were occupying six or seven rooms.I do not think this makes a case for fixing the single person&apos;s incomelimit   ?,bove  364, or  7 a week.     The  7 limit would also make it easier for me to defend, as I must, the fact that we are taking fromthe single person on  8 a week  21 a year in income tax if he is under65, or nearly  12 if over 65.7.       I would summarise the issue as follows:(i)   The relief to the individual ratepayer is very substantial under either set ox proposals.     For example, except in one case,a  20 per year rate bill is reduced to  11 per year under theMinister&apos;s proposals, and to  11 13s, 4d. under mine.(ii)  This is an instance where we can secure a reduction in Voteexpenditure of  3-4 million per year (and of  1 million per year which would fail on the rates) with the minimum effecton our social policies and on the individual beneficiary.(iii)  In a difficu.lt public expenditure situation, where a number ofmy colleagues&apos; draft Estimates are likely to be submitted atsubstantially higher figures than had been expected in the summer, the adoption of my proposals here would make a significant contribution.D, J, C,Treasury Chambers, S.
