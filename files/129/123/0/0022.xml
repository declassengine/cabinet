[IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)66C. (65) 172 COPY NO.__-6th December, 1965CABINETHOUSINGMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Cabinet agreed in July (C, C. (65) 43rd Conclusions,Minute 3) that the local authority housing authorisations (England andWales) should be kept at 150, 000 in 1965 and in 1966, which determined the capital expenditure for 1966-67, at  477 million.    The Minister of housing made the reservation that, if there was a substantial fall in private sector house building in 1966 the public sector should beincreased, and that this would involve higher capital expenditure than was being allowed for; and it was agreed that the position should bekept under review.2.      In the public expenditure allocation, the group under my chairmanship had given great weight to housing, which had been allocated (capital expenditure and subsidies)  110 million out of the&quot;additional&quot; total of  240 million for 1969-70 allocated to the pro-grarnmes under consideration at that time.3, The report of the Group on the Construction Industries,circulated with E. D. (65) 115, showed the following prospectivesituation:-Starts 1965 1966Public Sector 180,000* 200,000*Private Sector 210,000 235,000390,000 435,000Output (195 8 prices)Public SectorPrivate Sector  m.	 m.

It clearly cannot be argued that the prospective situation in1966, either of starts or of output, calls for any new special action.-1-SECRET

5.     The report of the Group on the Construction Industries said thatthe pressure on the construction industry would be slightly (about per cent) less in 1966 than in 1965.    But in 1965 there was a seriousoverload, with lengthening construction periods and rapidly risingconstruction earnings (hourly earnings up by 9 per cent from April, 1964to April, 1965).    Shortages in the main crafts are expected to continue in 1966.6.     Just as important and relevant is the course of the economicsituation and the balance of payments situation, which are not showingthe easing which we hoped and, with the continuing rapid increase ofpublic expenditure, are going to confront me with a very difficultBudgetary situation.    It is early to judge the outcome, but it seems clear that any additional load which v/e put on the economy for 1966 willhave to be compensated at Budget-time.     There is no room in the economy for taking on new additional demands.7.     The Minister asks for 156,000 authorisations in 1965 and in1966 compared with the present agreed rate of 150,000 in each year.If the extra 6, 000 approvals for 1966 are given in the early part of theyear, this adds another  19 million to expenditure in 1966/67.    If the extra 1966 approvals were spread evenly over the year, the additional expenditure in 1966/67 would be  16. 4 million, but in that case alarge number of the extra approvals would not add at all to construction in 1966.8.     I understood at the Economic Development Committee meeting that the extra were needed to deal with development area and other special regional questions, and on this basis was prepared to go alittle higher.    But I gather that the development area and similarneeds are given priority in any case, so this does not arise.    Indeed,the additional houses may well be in places of great shortage of labourand inflationary pressure.9.      I understand that up to 3rd December 132, 000 houses have been authorised for 1965, with 4, 000 to come for the Greater London Council.The Minister believes there has been some reluctance in applying forauthorisations in advance of the announcement of the new subsidyarrangements.    To safeguard this, I should be ready for there to be acarry-over into January if 150,000 cannot be authorised in time beforethe end of December, 1965.10.     I fully understand that the new subsidies may increa.se the requests from local authorities;   but the levels of subsidies had beenfully discussed when we fixed the level of authorisations for 1965/66;and I do not think there is any new factor there.11.     To sum up, I cannot accept the view that we need to increasehousing further in order to stabilise the economic situation.    that view was founded months ago, when it was feared that the measureswhich we had taken might lead to serious deflation.    But that is notthe case at all; and the better wo do with exports in 1966 the greaterwill be the inflationary pressure inside the economy.    I sympathise with the minister&apos;s desire for a larger programme, but he sharesthat ambition with most of our other colleagues, and he has notestablished any special reasons for re-opening his programme in isolation from others.-2-

12.     I propose, therefore, that we ask the Minister to stick to15 0, 000 in 1965 (and carrying some over into 1966 if necessa.ry), andstick for the time being to 15 0, 000 for 1966, with a further review inthe light of the course of the economy and the Budget prospects in, say,three months&apos; time.L. J. C.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.6th December, 1965
