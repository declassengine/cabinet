DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY CF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)C. (65) 182 COPY NO,17th December, 1965CABINETG6SCOTTISH TEACHERS&apos; salaries memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i seek the authority of my colleagues to give effect to salary increases for Scottish teachers from 1st April, 1966, at the levels put to me as an agreed recommendation by the negotiating body representingthe education authorities and the teachers&apos; associations in Scotland.The existing scales date from April, 1963, and the overall increaseproposed is marginally under 15 per cent.    in the light of the 13 percent increase given to teachers in England and Wales from 1st April,1965, which contained a substantial measure of revaluation, and of what has happened since, the proposed increase is, in my view, justified inequity and compatible with our incomes policy.2.       The position was discussed in the Sub-Committee on Prices and incomes of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Development at ameeting on 16th December, but no agreement was reached.    As adecision has to be taken urgently, I must therefore bring the matterforward now.3.       The background and the considerations which must bear uponcur decision are set out in the Annex.4.       The First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for economic affairs has proposed that the increase should be limited to 13 per cent.He argues that this would be enough to bring Scottish teachers to the samerelative pay level as the English teachers;   and that the increase of just under 15 per cent which I propose would have a bad effect on publicopinion - and trade union opinion - in terms of the attitude to our incomes policy.5.       To limit the increase to 13 per cent, on the grounds that this isenough to bring Scottish teachers to the same relative pay level as theEnglish teachers, is to ignore the fact that the Scottish teachers havehad no increase since 1963 and are now quite clearly at a disadvantagecompared with teachers in England, who have had the benefit of a 13 percent increase from April of this year.    We must deal fairly by theScottish teachers;   and we must give them the revaluation which v/epromised the teaching, profession,     V/e cannot do this at less than thepercentage I propose - just under 15 per cent cn the salary bill.    Infact, for all but the lowest paid teachers (those on the non-graduatescale, at present  600- 1,190), the increase would be little more than14 per cent (14. 35 per cent to be exact).-1-

Sc otti sh Off ic e, S. W. I.17th December, 19656.       I fully accept that we must do everything v/e can to sustain our policy on prices and incomes, but I cannot think that our policy is likelyto be prejudiced by my acceptance of an agreed settlement at just under15 per cent.    I do not believe that a Scottish settlement of this order islikely to have any real impact on our policy.7.       I must stress the seriousness of the situation which will face us if I cannot implement the agreed settlement.    We shall certainly be con-fronted, with a succession of strikes, in which hitherto responsibleelements will join, which will not only disrupt the education service cutalso expose us to damaging criticism from many quarters, including ourown supporters.    It must be kept in mind too that I have to proceed byway of regulations which are subject to the negative resolution procedure,and if the agreed settlement is not to be excepted, we will be faced witha Parliamentary onslaught even from our own side on the floor of theHouse on the Prayer which would be inevitable.     To evoke all thisopposition for the sake of less than 2 per cent over two years, and against an agreed settlement, will do us serious damage politically and in myopinion will not aid our incomes policy.

5.       The First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for economic affairs has proposed that the Scottish settlement should be at 13 percent like the English one.     But this would apply a flat rate of increase at different dates to rates which were previously set at different levels to run for different periods.     The straightforward way to reckonis, I think, to measure the total earnings over the whole period from1963, when Hie salaries in the two countries diverged, to 1967 when thecurrent English award expires, taking an index figure for each year,with 1963 equal to 100.    If we give the Scottish teachers 13 per cent theposition is that --3-. a n t%ANNEXSCOTTISH TEACHERS&apos; SALARIESBackgroundNegotiations on teachers1 salaries in Scotland are conductedseparately from those in England and Wales, the present negotiatingbody being the Scottish Joint Council for Teachers&apos; Salaries.     TheGovernment are not represented on this body and are not party to thenegotiations, which take place between representatives of the employingauthorities and o  teachers&apos; organisations;  but it is open to me to accept,reject or modify any recommendations which the Council make to me.2.       The existence of separate negotiating machinery reflects the separate tradition of the education service in Scotland and the considerabledifferences between the structure and qualifications of the teaching profession norm and south of the Border.     The structure of the scalesand the rela.tivities between them have long been different in the twocountries.    Sy and large, increases in salaries have tended to be madeat roughly the same time, and the practice has been to aim at approximately the same overall percentage increase in the salary bills in the two countries.3.       In 1963, however, the salary movements in the two countriesdiverged.     Teachers in England received a 7 per cent increase to last for two years:   teachers in Scotland obtained a 10 per cent increase inreturn for giving an assurance that they would neither initiate norsupport any claim for a further increase to have effect within threeyears.     Their level was therefore higher than the English - 110 corn-pared with 107, on the basis of the 1963 level as 100,     The two-year period in England has been followed by an award, after arbitration, ofa 13 per cent increase from April, 1965.     Since men it is the scottish teachers who have been behind, but they have adhered to the bargainthey made in 1963.4.       The negotiating committees of the Scottish Joint Council for teachers&apos; Salaries reached agreement in November on recommendations for increases from 1st April, 1966, which would amount overall to just under 15 per cent;   and these agreed recommendations were submittedby the Council on 26th November.The main issue

(i)  the Scottish teachers over the period from 1963 to April, 1966,when the 13 per cent would be due to come into effect, will havereceived less than the English teachers and so will be behind;(ii)  with the 13 per cent they will still not have caught up in April,1967:  and(iii)  any award that is likely to be made to English teachers then whenthe current English scales are due for review will keep theScottish teachers behind.I could not defend this situation.     The teachers would feel that theGovernment had left them to suffer from the consequences of a settle-ment designed to last for three years.     They are, naturally, veryconscious of the fact that by April, 1966, their level of remunerationwill have been substantially lower than that of English teachers for awhole year.     They will expect their increase when it comes to take some account of this.6.       If, on the other hand, we give effect to the agreed settlement,the position over the four years 1963 to 1967 is that the Scottish teacherswill go marginally ahead in 1966-67, making up in that year a littlemore than the ground, they will have lost in 1965-66.    Any award at theend of the current English settlement will put English teachers ahee.dagain.7,       I appreciate feat an exceptional pay increase of this order has tobe looked at in the context of incomes policy.    But I believe it is con-sistent with the criteria we set for increases above the norm in ourWhite Paper on Prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd. 2639).    The second of these (paragraph 15(ii)) provided for an exceptional increase when itwas designed to improve recruitment when this is essential in thenational interest.    I need not labour the relevance of this in relation toteachers.     The fourth criterion provided for those workers whose payhad fallen seriously out of line and needed to be improved in the national interest.    We have all recognised publicly that this applies to teachers.8.       I have considered also the public presentation aspect.    PurelyScottish settlements obtain very little notice outside Scotland.     This one would, outside Scotland, be of interest mainly to English teachers and itdoes not seem likely that they would take any exception tc the increasebeing higher than theirs after the longer period.    I have myself beenunder pressure from the Scottish T.U.C. to take steps to improveteacher recruitment and I cannot believe that they would regard myacceptance of an agreed settlement at this level as in any wayembarrassing in other directions.Costs9.       The cost of a 15 per cent increase is estimated at about  8. million (about  7.25 million for full-time, certificated school teachers and about  .9 million for other teachers whose salaries are directly related to those in schools, such as teachers in further educationestablishments, including central institutions, and colleges ofeducation). ;
