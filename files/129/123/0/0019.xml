IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(65) 1693rd December, 1965CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:Note by the Chancellor of the exchequer submit for the approval cf my colleagues a White Paper onthe Planning and Control of Public Expenditure which I would hope topresent and publish on 14th December.2.       The main purpose of the White Paper is to give a clear state-rnent of the way in which the control and planning of public expenditurenow operates.     To a very considerable extent we have broken newground since we tcGk office by our adoption of a fixed percentage increase for the growth of total public expenditure and the system of allocating resources to the main blocks of expenditure within an over-all limit.     My colleagues know only too well how difficult the operationhas been.     That it has so far succeeded is no mean achievement.Therefore we should set out in this way what we have done and the way in which we have done it.    It is right that we should take credit for what is generally regarded as a remarkable advance in the control ofpublic expenditure, and that we should make available to students ofthis important field this exposition of the working of the government machine.3.       The main figures on public expenditure were all included in chapter 18 of the National Plan.     The figures in this White Paper setthese out again and supplement them in various ways, e. g. by giving a breakdown by spending authority which was not included in the earlierdocument.     They a.lsc give for the first time the public investmentfigures for 1966-67 and the outcome of the 27th July measures fordeferment of capital projects; and the White Paper firms up the Plan&apos;s figures for nationalised industries&apos; investment up to 1970, incorporatingthe Governments decisions since the Plan was published.-t.&apos;.

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE: planning and CONTROLI IntroductionOne of the Governments first tasks when they came into office was toexamine the prospects and priorities of public expenditure. There were large expansion programmes in progress for the various public services,which had been published in outline in December 1963*. These did not, inthe Governments view, provide adequately for the nation&apos;s social or economicneeds. Even so, they would have fully absorbed for the years ahead the future growth of revenue at the rates of taxation then ruling, even if the nation hadmanaged to achieve a regular rate of growth of the gross national productas high as 4 per cent a year.2. The Government began a review of public expenditure in order toredeploy for more productive purposes and for the strengthening of thebalance of payments the resources which were engaged on work of loweconomic priority for the Government; to give effect to the governments own concepts of social priority ; and to bring the growth of public expenditureinto a sounder relationship with the development of the national economy.3. The process of reshaping involved : (a) A decision to limit the total growth of public sector expenditure toan average of 4  per cent a year at constant prices from 1964-65 to1969-70: this was subsequently confirmed as part of the national plan.t(b) Within this total, a long-term allocation of resources to each of themain public services to provide the quantitative framework for their development.(c) A strict review of individual programmes, in particular of defence.id) A review of the investment of the nationalised industries to fit in with the National Plan.ie) More effective implementation of the programmes and an improve-ment of financial control, to get better value for money.4. This White Paper describes the first results of this re-shaping, theprocedure which the Government adopted to carry it out, and the methods by which the Government intend to continue the process in the future, toenable the public services to make the best possible contribution to thedevelopment of the national economy and to provide for the most importantsocial priorities, the programmes of social improvement and economic expansion going forward together, each dependent upon the other, as partof the National Plan. The relevant statements of Government policy appear in Appendix I.II Aggregate of Public Sector expenditure . The Governments object throughout has been to look at public expenditure as a whole ; to make the best possible estimate of the cost wheneach question has come forward for decision, and to present the choicesbetween different programmes and between alternative courses within them.* &quot; Public Expenditure in 1963-64 and 1967-68 &quot;.

In their first days in office, the Government considered the choices open tothem in this way, and decided their first social priorities, which were toincrease the rates of national insurance and associated benefits and to remove the prescription charges.6. These choices are made from a comprehensive aggregate of public sector expenditure, including both current and capital expenditure by central and by local government, and the gross outgoings of the National insurance funds, but excluding debt interest. This total was about  10,500 million in1964-65. It involves expenditure of many kinds: e.g., purchases of defence equipment and laboratory supplies ; the employment of soldiers and hospitalstaffs by the central government, and of teachers and firemen by localgovernment; the construction of houses, schools and roads ; payments ofnational insurance benefits and of national assistance to those in need ;support for agriculture ; loans and grants to firms moving to the development districts ; aid to under-developed countries.7. The.se expenditures are linked by three common strands. First, allare decided by Government, central and local, on grounds of public interest.Secondly, they generally involve directly or indirectly a claim on the nation&apos;sproductive resources a direct claim where the Government are employingmanpower, buying goods or paying for construction, and an indirect claimwhere the Government pay pensions or family allowances, or give grants to universities or loans to industrial enterprises. Such &quot;transfer payments&quot;give their recipients a claim on resources, which becomes an addition to demand except to the extent that the payments are saved ; and in most casesthe circumstances are such that the payments are spent. Thirdly, all theseexpenditures are paid for either from taxation, local rates or national insurance contributions, or by borrowing from the public* ; the extent of both taxation and borrowing will depend primarily upon the economic situation.8. The investment of nationalised industries and certain other public corporations, like the B.B.C., and the Exchequer advances to them, arehandled separately. This is because the nationalised industries are enterprisesproducing goods and services for sale ; and the size and composition of their investment are considered in relation to the industrial needs of the economy and the commercial policy of the undertakings themselves, and have less in common with the generality of central and local government expenditurethan with the rest of industry. Subsidies to them are of course included inthe aggregate.9. For review and control purposes the aggregate of public sector expenditure is divided into functional blocks. Each heading defence budget, education, health and welfare, benefits and assistance, and so on includes all the expenditure for the particular purpose. For example, theeducation total includes the pay of teachers and other running costs, new building, provision of equipment, student awards and teachers&apos; superannua-tion, for the whole range of publicly-financed educational institutions fromprimary schools to universities, whether these are the responsibility of theDepartment of Education and Science and the Scottish Education Depart-ment, or of the local authorities, or of private bodies, such as universities,receiving grants and loans from Government Departments and localauthorities.* The receipts and expenditure of the public sector are analysed in Appendix IV.
-a \A10. This classification enables the Government to consider the develop-ment of the various services as a whole, and to decide the priorities betweenthem. Each main block is within the scope of one Minister (except wherethere are separate Departments for Scotland and Wales); and each minister is able to decide how to use the resources allocated to him within it. Theextent to which the whole block of expenditure is under the detailed controlof the Minister will vary from case to case ; but even where the minister has no formal control, as with much local authority expenditure, the Govern-ment Departments policy and the procedures for determining the level ofGovernment grant or the loan sanctions for capital expenditure may bringthe dimensions and direction of the development of the services within theinfluence of the Minister.11. The aggregate of public sector expenditure is dominated by a fewlarge programmes. The defence budget, roads, public housing investment and subsidies, education, health and welfare, benefits and assistance account for about three-quarters of the total. Some important programmes, such asassistance to industry, cannot be realistically predicted over a long period ;so the main programmes represent an even greater proportion of thoseexpenditures for which long-term programmes can be drawn up in advance.12. The period 1964-65 to 1969-70 was chosen for the review. the out-turn for the base year 1964-65 was not then known and an estimate was used: the expenditure for the year 1965-66 was to a considerable extentdetermined by the plans of the previous Government: four more years were then covered to 1969-70. In general, this is the most convenient period for considering the development of most of the main public services for many it is the time required to train skilled staffs and to plan and buildnew capital facilities.13. The phasing of development of these services is such that it isdifficult to make substantial changes of direction, even four years ahead,without the risk of dislocation. The defence review is aimed at eliminatinga prospective 20 per cent increase in expenditure from 1964-65 to 1969-70:and this is involving a radical review of world-wide commitments andweapon systems and procurement arrangements. The practical problem of allocation between the main civil programmes was concerned with thedistribution between them in the year 1969-70 of an amount of resourcesequivalent to about 3 per cent of the total. It would be possible, withsome dislocation, to alter the course of development of these services more rapidly, but the nature and technology of most of the main public servicesrequire a planning period of four or five years.Ill-The 1965 Survey and Allocation14. In order to draw up a comprehensive set of public sector expenditure programmes, the Government had to decide at an early stage how muchpublic expenditure should be provided for in the period up to 1969-70.The preparation of forward estimates of the cost implications of public expenditure policies was a familiar one: there had been an annual survey of public sector expenditure from 1961 onwards, in accordance with the330281 A 3
recommendations of the Plowden Committee*. The essential and novelelement was the procedure of deciding first how much the country could afford ; then deciding how this could best be deployed ; and finally requiringeach spending Minister to arrange his expenditure within his agreed allocation.15. The Department of Economic Affairs and the Treasury therefore prepared an initial assessment of the growth of gross national productwhich could reasonably be expected, and then of the resources which were required to improve the balance of payments, to strengthen private and nationalised industries&apos; investment, to provide for the expansion of public expenditure on the lines of the policies then ruling, and to allow for thegrowth of private consumption.16. The outcome was the Cabinet&apos;s decision in January to impose a limit on the rate of growth of the aggregate of public sector expenditure(as defined above) from 1964-65f to 1969-70 of 23 per cent (i.e. anaverage of 4  per cent a year) at constant prices. It was necessary todecide this provisional guideline first in order to establish an effectivestarting-point for the reshaping of programmes. The decision was announced in Parliament by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 22nd February, 1965,when presenting the Vote on Account.17. The 1965 Survey of public sector expenditure began as soon asthe Cabinet decision had been made, starting with instructions for a detailed costing by all spending Departments of their policies for theperiod 1964-65 to 1969-70. These were divided between &quot;basic&quot; pro-grammes, which were to be drawn up within limits laid down in advance and related to the developments of the individual services already in train,and &quot; additional &quot; programmes representing the cost of further improvements which could be made if more resources were made available. The pro-grammes were prepared at constant prices, so that the change in expendi-ture shown from year to year excluded any effect which price changes(including changes in wages and salaries) might have on the amount ofmoney to be spent.!18. The returns by Departments covered the whole field of public sector expenditure. They were subjected to a rigorous scrutiny in order toensure: (a) that the financial implications of existing policies had been fullytaken into account in the &quot; basic &quot; programmes:(b) that realistic costings had been made of the &quot; additional &quot; programmes and policies.There was available to the Government in June, following this examina-tion, a detailed Survey of the prospects for public expenditure, which coveredboth &quot; basic &quot; and &quot; additional &quot; programmes, and this was agreed by the* &quot; The Control of Public Expenditure &quot;.   Cmnd. 1432 (July, 1961).f The out-turn for 1964-65 was lower than was expected last January: the cabinets decision related to the comparison with the figures and definitions at the time of the originalstatement, which are set out in the tables in Appendix III.I The figures for current expenditure on goods and services were prepared as nearly aspossible on the same price basis as the 1965-66 Budget Estimates. Figures for capitalexpenditure were mostly at March, 1965 prices. Payments such as subsidies and grants and loans to industry, which do not involve the direct purchase of goods and services, weremeasured in such a way as to make no allowance for any effects from price changes. the costings prepared on the basis described are referred to collectively as &quot; at 1965 Survey prices &quot;.
spending Departments and the Treasury and the Department of economic affairs to be as realistic and accurate a costing as was possible.19. The Survey provided for a contingency allowance of  100 million for1969-70 in order to make some provision for possible needs for extra expendi-ture by the Government in circumstances which cannot be foreseen e.g., forunforeseeable natural calamities ; and for the tendency for the implementation of policies to cost more than expected. The allowance made is three-quarters of one per cent of total expenditure.20. While the Survey of public expenditure was taking place, the pre-paration of the National Plan was proceeding. More refined analysis ofthe economic prospects for 1964 to 1970 confirmed the initial decision limit-ing the growth of public sector expenditure to 4J per cent a year at constant prices. The examination of the prospects of the construction and engineer-ing industries, and the prospective supply and demand for manpower,showed where special pressures were likely to exist; and these were takeninto account in the scrutiny of the expenditure programmes. One fact ofparticular importance was the requirement of the health and education servicestogether with public administration for some 500,000* extra people between1964 and 1970, a requirement greater than the total increase of manpowerexpected to be available. This conclusion put great weight on the importanceof efficiency in the use of manpower throughout the public sector, and illus-trated the existence of physical as well as financial limitations to the expan-sion of these services.21. The Survey was considered, together with the relevant evidenceaccumulating from the work on the Plan, by a group of senior Ministers,none of whom had large Departmental responsibilities for any particularblock of expenditure, under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Ex-chequer. The Ministers responsible for the main expenditure programmes were consulted one by one. In the light of this examination, the Grouprecommended the adoption of specified limits for each of the main programmes of expenditure, both for 1966-67 and for 1969-70. The Group made theirreport to the Cabinet, in July, and decisions were taken on each of the main programmes for the two years in question. These decisions were announced in the National Plan.IV  Composition of Public Sector Expenditure22. In parallel with this process of Survey and allocation, the review,announced in October, 1964, of certain programmes was in progress ; and theultimate shaping of the programmes resulted from the combined effect of these operations and also from the day-to-day decisions taken in the course ofthe year.23. The defence review was under way by Christmas 1964. The defence white PaperJ presented in February 1965 formulated the problem of finding the means by which defence expenditure during the next few years mightbe contained at roughly the then current figure in real terms. The continua-* The National Plan, Chapter 3, paragraph 18.t The Tables in Appendix III are developed from and supplement those in Chapter 18of the National Plan.t Statement on the Defence Estimates, 1965, Cmnd. 2592 (February, 1965).
tion of previously existing policy would have involved an increase at constant prices from an estimated  2,000 million in 1964-65 to  2,400 million by1969-70 ; and after the first stages of the review, the Government were ableto adopt the reduction to  2,000 million in 1969-70 as a definite objectiveon which economic planning could be based. A series of decisions wastaken from January onwards, notably on aircraft procurement, the futureof the Army reserves, and the cancellation of the 5th Polaris submarinewhich went more than half-way towards the target of a saving of  400million.*24. A similarly radical review has been made of civil defence25. Expenditure on overseas assistance, which is to a large extent deter-mined some two years in advance by previous decisions, is expected to rise from about  190 million a year in 1964-65 to about  225 million a year in1966-67 on the basis of existing commitments. The future programme will depend on periodic reviewed/s in the light of progress made in overcoming our economic problems.26. In the social and community services, the main characteristics of thereshaping of programmes! have been:  (a) A very large expansion in public sector housing investment and asubstantial increase in subsidies, involving increases of 33 per cent and 68 per cent respectively from 1964-65 to 1969-704(b) A continuing expansion from 1964-65 to 1969-70 in education(32 per cent) and health and welfare (23\ per cent).(c) In benefits and assistance, an increase of 38 per cent, of which[7] per cent is attributable to higher numbers : the first priority hasbeen given to the introduction of earnings-related benefit in the early months of unemployment, sickness, industrial injury and widowhood.(d) The police and prisons services show together an increase of 22 percent.(e) For roads, the increase is just over 40 per cent, with construction and major improvements showing an increase of over 70 per cent to 364 million in 1969-70, but these are not keeping pace with the increasing pressure on road space.(/) The control of miscellaneous local authority investment (town halls,parks, etc.) has been tightened.27. On the economic side, a large number of measures have been takenor announced to stimulate mobility of labour and advanced technology, with considerable extra expenditure, e.g. expansion of training facilities, redundancies-dancy payments to improve the mobility of labour, extension of development districts, special funds for the National Coal Board to expedite closure ofunecomonic pits, increased funds for the National Research Development* Statement by Secretary of State for Defence 5th August, 1965.

Corporation^ investment in innovations in such fields as computers, machine tools and process control; encouragement of farm amalgamations ; exportpromotion ; and the National Ports Councils development programme forports. Arrangements have been made (see Appendix II) to get clearer criteriaby which to judge of the circumstances in which proposals for civil tech-nological research and development should be approved.28. The composition of public sector expenditure (Appendix III, Table 1)will change considerably in the next few years. Defence and related expendi-ture will proportionately be taking much less: there will probably be greaterexpenditure on incentives and services which are designed to improve the performance of the national economy: the need to improve the socialinfrastructure, notably in housing but also in communications, related to regional development, will certainly involve large increases particularly ofcapital expenditure: the education and health services will continue to expand: and the growing numbers of old people, and the desire to improve their standard of living in line with that of the rest of the community, will involve rapidly increasing expenditures on benefits and assistance of allkinds.29. In terms of economic category also the composition of public sector expenditure will change (Appendix III, Table 2). Capital formation (i.e.expenditure on houses, roads, schools, hospitals, etc.) is likely to increase by nearly 50 per cent: this expenditure together with the investment of the nationalised industries* and other domestic capital expenditure! is set out in greater detail in Appendix III, Table 6 and shows a total capital increaseof nearly 28 per cent. Current expenditure on goods and services is likelyto increase by only 15 per cent, with the stabilisation of defence expenditure,nearly all of which, whether of current or capital character, is included inthis category. The 38 per cent increase in current grants to persons is duepredominantly to benefits and assistance, but there are other rapidly expand-ing items here, such as grants to universities.30. In Appendix III, Table 3, the totals are divided by spending authority Government Departments, national insurance funds, local authorities. Theincrease in local authorities&apos; expenditure, current and capital, is put at 35 percent, reflecting the rapid growth of education, roads and housing. This rapidprospective growth of local authorities&apos; expenditure underlines the need forthe change in the financial relationship between central and local governmentwhich is now under discussion between the Departments and the localauthority associations, and which will be the subject of legislation duringthe present Session.V Development of Long-Term Programmes31. The 1965 Survey and allocation operations have established guide-lines for the development of each of the main services, with specific limits for 1966-67 and 1969-70. Similar limits will be established for those smallerservices for which it is practicable to draw up a long-term programme.32. These five-year guidelines have a dual purpose, for they provide a framework both for the planning of the service and for financial control.The Minister in charge of each service has as much assurance as it is prac-* Appendix III, Table 5.t For a definition of this term see footnote (1) to Table 6, Appendix in.
ticable to give of the resources which will be at the disposal of the service.This enables him to plan how to use them to the best advantage ; and itgreatly eases the day-to-day operation of financial control.33. The extent to which there are specific long-term programmes inphysical terms depends upon the administrative and technological content of each service. In defence, the period of weapons production is so longthat ten-year costings are needed, and have been used for some years. the functional costing system* has also been set up as a tool for long-term defence planning. The technology of the road programme requires that it should be planned in detail four years ahead, with some judgment made of what develop-ment will be possible for a further period of years. In the education programme, the two crucial long-term factors are the supply of teachers andthe supply of buildings ; and in the latter it is the general practice for pro-grammes of starts to be authorised to local authorities and universities threeyears ahead (i.e. in respect of buildings to be finished five or more years ahead). In the health service, a long-term hospital programme is in progress,and the allocations for running costs are settled firmly for the coming yearand provisionally for the next year or two thereafter. In housing the need to plan well head, covering both the public and private sectors, has become increasingly evident.34. This long-term planning of the public services has developed farin recent years and will be extended further; and this can now be done with more assurance. The shift of emphasis to the evaluation and appraisal of long-term programmes and the long-term allocation of resources to them is leading to the development of better methods to measure and comparethe cost-effectiveness of alternative courses of action. In the variouseconomic services, and particularly the investment of nationalised industries,the techniques of appraisal are being continuously improved (see paragraph42 below). Likewise in defence, the appraisal of the military effectiveness of alternative weapon systems in relation to their cost is now being increas-ingly developed: the process makes it possible to choose either the cheapestmeans of accomplishing a defined military objective, or the means ofderiving the maximum military value from a given expenditure of resources. There are analogous opportunities for applying similar tech-techniques in the social and community services ; and as the long-term pro-grammes become more clearly defined, the use of these tools of manage-ment will extend, and better value for money will result.35. The extension of commitment of the national resources for several years ahead means that there has to be an element of flexibility in the programmes, as is shown in paragraphs 54 et seq. below. They representtoo large a part of the use of resources to be independent of the fluctuations in the national economy. The physical programmes themselves need tobe flexible enough, moreover, to be adjusted for unexpected populationmovements, changes in costs and techniques, and new social and economic developments.36. About 85 per cent of the whole of public sector expenditure is ofa kind which is suitable for long-term planning within fixed financial limits on the lines described, though the scope for specific long-term programmes* Statement on the Defence Estimates, 1965, paras. 36-40.
defined in physical terms is much less. For this 85 per cent it wouldappear to be possible to draw up five-year costings of expenditure with asufficient degree of realism to permit an allocation to be made and financial control to be exercised accordingly.37. For the remaining 15 per cent, in which it is impracticable to draw up a long-term programme or to work to a long-term financial allocation,other forms of control ensure that aggregate expenditure on these does not increase excessively fast and carry the total public expenditure above the level which has been laid down.38. In most of these cases, the cost of a specific policy in a particularyear can be forecast only within wide limits. The outturn of the agricul-tural subsidies every year will depend heavily upon the level of productionand the course of world prices: under the present guaranteed price system,therefore, it is impossible to confine this part of expenditure on agricul-ture within predetermined limits. Expenditure on agricultural services andon the long-term improvement of agriculture is also difficult to forecast: butit is less subject to wholly unpredictable factors. Firms moving to the develop-ment districts are entitled to standard grants for buildings and for plant and machinery ; but it may be impossible to say, particularly when a new develop-ment of this policy is introduced, how many applicants there will be and how long will elapse before the grants require to be paid. The size of the british railways Board deficit depends in part on variable factors beyond the Board&apos;control. Some kinds of work, particularly but not exclusively in the field of advanced technology, are subject to large and unforeseen escalations of cost.39. In each of these illustrations, however, the Governments actionsare of major importance to the cost. The strength of the stimuli givento production in the Farm Price Review, the size and attractiveness of grants under the Local Employment Act, decisions on proposals to close uneconomicrailway services, the cost control of the projects which are liable to escalate:all lead clearly to short-term and long-term increases or decreases in cost.The importance of cost-effectiveness and the appraisal of proper choicesare as great here as in the services for which long-term programmes are practicable.VI Nationalised Industries40. For reasons described in paragraph 8, the investment of nationalised industries is not included in the aggregate of public sector expenditure, andis not therefore subject to the limits imposed upon this aggregate. The invest-ment of these industries, and their sound development, are at the centre ofthe National Plan, partly because of their strategic importance to the economy,and partly because of their size (capital  8,800 million ; labour force approach-ing 2 million ; output about one-tenth of gross domestic product; investment of  1,350 million in 1965-66, or about the same as that of the whole of manufacturing industry). They are also of great significance because theydepend upon the Exchequer for their supplies of new capital in so far as theycannot provide these from their own resources.41. These investment programmes were examined in order to ensure thattheir size and content were adequate to provide the necessary energy, transport and communications for the economic expansion provided in the Plan. The
estimated capital expenditure in 1964-65/-66/-67 and in 1969-70 is set out for each undertaking in Table 5 in Appendix III. This table incorporatesthe decisions on these programmes taken by the Government since the publica-tion of the National Plan.* The rapid expansion in recent years which isexpected to take the total of nationalised industries&apos; investment up from  1,180million in 1964-65 to  1,470 million in 1966-67 is coming to an end, and thetotal is expected to fall to  1,400 million by 1969-70. The effect of this coursewill be to free more resources after 1967 for public service investment, for private manufacturing investment, and for exports.42. Of the increase from 1964-65 to 1966-67 of  286 million, or 24 percent, on nationalised industries&apos; investment,  132 million is attributable toelectricity,  61 million to gas, and  70 million to the Post Office. In thefollowing years to 1969-70, the level of Post Office investment will expandsubstantially. This is expected to be more than offset by the fall in theelectricity programme as the increased generating capacity initiated in recentyears to overcome the dangers of power shortages in the expanding economyconies into service: the position will be reconsidered in the spring in the lightof this winter&apos;s experience.43. The scale of the investment is such that the Government and theindustries themselves are devoting increasing attention to the techniques and criteria for investment appraisal. Allowance must be made for thesocial and non-economic obligations which most nationalised industries arerequired to undertake. But having done this, it is essential, in order to ensurethe most efficient deployment of the national resources, that the minimumreturn on new capital in the nationalised industries should be comparable with that obtainable elsewhere in the economy. The most up-to-datetechniques are being developed in order to carry this into effect. The appraisalsof the development of the nuclear power programme, of the choice betweenthe various projects for developing the South Wales iron ore ports, and of theelectrification of the railway line from London to Southampton andBournemouth are important recent examples.!44. The financial objectives which are agreed from time to time between these industries and the Government define the return to be sought on theindustries&apos; capital assets as a whole, and are the guideline for the industries&apos;commercial policies. The nationalised industries, like any other industries,are subject to the Governments general policy on prices and incomes. TheGovernment have made it clear that they expect these industries to do all they can to absorb increases in costs by increasing efficiency ; and have referred nationalised industries&apos; price proposals to the National Board for prices and Incomes.45. Over the entire field of nationalised industry, the return on capital in1964-65 averaged 4-2 per cent. There is a wide variation between the financial objectives of 8 per cent (net of historical depreciation) and 12-4 per cent(gross) for the Post Office and the Electricity Council respectively, and the losses of the railways and the coal industry. The lower the return, thegreater is the financial call on the Exchequer; and in spite of the improved* The National Plan, page 57.t &quot; Iron Ore IniDorts into South Wales &quot;, Cmnd. 2706 (July, 1965) and &quot; Fuel Policy &quot;,Cmnd. 2798 (October, 1965).
financial performance in recent years, the industries borrowed over  550million from the Exchequer in 1964-65, and their borrowing will be more in 1965-66.46. Where it has been necessary to undertake full scale reorganisation ofan industry to meet changed economic circumstances, substantial sums ofcapital have also had to be written off or placed in suspense:  1,192 million for the British Transport Commission in 1962 and  110 million for theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation and  415 million for the national coal Board in 1965. These write-offs are, in accounting terms, a recognitionof the changed value of the assets they represent, but the cancellation of the industries&apos; debt to the Exchequer which enables these sums to be written off in no way reduces the burden on the community. The Exchequerlends to the industries at the same rate as it borrows in the market. Theinterest payments made by the industries to the Exchequer just suffice tomeet the interest payments which the Exchequer must itself make to those from whom it has borrowed. When Exchequer loans to the industries arecancelled as part of a capital reconstruction, the Government must of coursecontinue to pay interest to the original lenders. The cancellation of exchequer loans to the amount of over  1,700 million in respect of the three reorganisa-tions above involves an annual permanent burden to the Exchequer on this account, which is at present of the order of  70 million.VII Phasing and Implementation47. The preceding sections describe the method by which the Govcrn-ment have undertaken the reshaping of public expenditure programmes whichthey began in October 1964. They start from the Governments decisionto contain the aggregate of public sector expenditure within a definite limitup to 1969-70 ; and describe the process of Survey of public expenditure and long-term allocation of resources between the main public services which followed ; and set out the pattern of expenditure which is likely to develop.This is the establishment of a framework ; and this final section sets outthe problems that arise in working within this framework.48. First, the time-scale of decisions, the great variety of public expenditure, in its purpose and function, its economic nature, and the variousauthorities which are responsible for it, present a formidable problem offorecasting future costs and containing expenditures within the limits laiddown. Within the 85 per cent of the aggregate of public sector expenditure for which forward costings of policy can realistically be undertaken, thereis no reason to doubt that the quality of the costing will improve, though there will probably continue to be a tendency to underestimate the futurecost of carrying out particular policies.49. The question of control is more complex, because of the variety ofpublic authorities whose expenditure is involved. The expenditure of theGovernment Departments is of course under the continuous control exer-cised through the annual Estimates ; and the out-turn is normally within areasonable margin of the original Estimates: in the last five years, the differ-ences have been4T-7 per cent, -f 3-5 per cent, 4-1-5 per cent, -2-3 per cent,and -1-1 per cent respectively (all in money terms). But the margins increase
considerably as the period lengthens. The expenditure of the national insurance Funds follows precisely from the Governments decisions on thevarious benefits and the numbers eligible for them, which can usually be predicted within a narrow margin. The extent to which the central govern-ment can affect the level of local authorities&apos; expenditure, which is about one-third of public sector expenditure, varies widely. There is control over their capital expenditure through loan sanctions and in some cases through specificstatutory powers. For current expenditure, there is in general no specificGovernment control; but the local authorities&apos; policies are in many casesthe expression of national policies, and are subject to Departmental regula-tions, and the fixing of levels of grants affects the ability of the local authori-ties to incur expenditure.50. Taking public sector expenditure as a whole, it is not possible toexercise a fine control over substantial periods ahead, but the essence of thelong-term allocation system is to ensure that the decisions involving commit-ments of economic resources for the future are taken according to a rationalpattern of priorities and a realistic view of the implications for the national economy of providing these resources ; and the technical possibilities of cost-ing and of financial control would seem adequate to support this.51. A problem not yet fully resolved is that which arises from the fact thatthe Survey and allocation of public sector programmes, and consequently the long-term programmes of the Departments, have to be carried out interms of constant prices because price changes do not affect the differentprogrammes in a uniform way. There is difficulty in comparing the actualexpenditures recorded after the event with the provision made in the pro-grammes. Moreover, figures at constant prices obscure the fact that theremay be pay and price increases of an exceptional character. Further, fromthe point of view of financing, the increases in costs caused by increases in pay and material prices are as significant as those required by the expansionof the public services, and anomalies may arise when one kind of cost increase is treated differently from another.52. The treatment of future expenditure in terms of constant pay and prices tends to underestimate the future weight of the public services in rela-tion to the national economy as a whole. Wages and salaries represent alarger part of the total cost of public services than of industry generally, andthe concept of the &quot; productivity &quot; of workers in services like defence and health and education cannot be as clear as in industry. Hence, if pay goesup in the public services at the same rate as in the private sector, the &quot; price &quot;(cost per unit in money terms) of providing these services will rise faster than the average price level for the economy as a whole ; and this tendencyis obscured in the programmes based on constant prices, and emerges inpractice only as events unfold.53. Secondly, there is the need to work the system with a due flexibility.To control public expenditure too rigidly in terms of an aggregate could leadto anomalies. Some kinds of public expenditure are potentially advantageousin their effect upon the national economy: the composition of the total ofpublic expenditure is as important as its size; and if the composition isfavourable for economic growth it is possible for the nation to &quot; afford &quot;a larger total than if the composition were unfavourable.   Some kinds of
-3     (public expenditure, on the other hand, call for particularly scarce Rinds of-S-resources, and must be limited accordingly. Great restraint on government expenditure overseas is likely to be necessary for as far ahead as can beseen. The public sector is such a large user of construction and some kinds of skilled manpower that the requirements have to be examined carefully fromthis point of view. The total amount of such public expenditure that thenation can &quot; afford &quot; will depend upon the measures taken both in increasingsupply and restraining demands to deal with these particular constraints.Again, there may be changes in fiscal policy which will substitute Govern-ment expenditures for tax reliefs or vice versa ; and although such changesmight be fiscally exactly equivalent, they would result in more or less&quot; public sector expenditure&quot; as defined in this section, and it would benecessary to redefine the total limit accordingly.54. The Government are likely to continue to need to establish a limit to the total of public sector expenditure in order to serve as a guide-line: but there may in future be room for changes in the definition andboundaries of the aggregate to which a limit is applied.55. Thirdly, there is the phasing of the programmes. In the early stages of the 5-year programme, the rate of increase in public expenditure is abovethe average rate from 1964-65 to 1969-70 of 4] per cent. Thus, the increase at constant prices from 1964-65 (as estimated at the time of the Survey) to1965-66 is likely to be 7-1 per cent. This is mainly because the programmes which the Government inherited on coming to power provided for very large increases in this period. The increase at constant prices from 1965-66 to1966-67 is likely to be much less than this ; and during the later years ofthe programme the growth of public expenditure may slow down to less than4j- per cent, with the flattening out of the defence programme playing animportant part in this result.56. Thus the pattern of the programmes in the 5-year period was a fasterincrease in the early years than in the later, a similar course to that in the totalof nationalised industries&apos; investment programmes (see paragraph 41).57. The immediate increase in public expenditure was more than the economy could bear, having regard to the pressure on resources and on thebalance of payments, and the Government therefore took the special measures announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 27th July. These were designed to moderate the rate of growth of public expenditure as effectivelyas possible, and with the least possible interference with the most urgent socialprogrammes. They concentrated on slowing down the rale of expenditure on capital expenditure and on deferring purchases of equipment and stores, andthey covered the whole of the public sector, including Government Depart-ments, local authorities and nationalised industries.58. It was necessary to act rapidly to reduce the overload, and this made it impossible to carry out a detailed adjustment of programmes. TheGovernment therefore decided to postpone the starting dates of non-industrial projects for six months, but exempted all projects in development districts, and houses, schools and hospitals. Loan sanctions were to begiven only in special circumstances for local authority loans for expenditureon land purchases in advance of requirements, on civic buildings, offices and a variety of miscellaneous projects ; and lending by local authorities
on mortgages for house purchase was restricted. Government departments were instructed to act accordingly; circulars were sent to local authoritiesinviting their action likewise ; and the chairmen of the nationalised industries were asked to help also.59. It is estimated that in the three months ending 31st October 1965central and local government capital expenditure projects to a total value ofabout  200 million have been deferred for six months. The effect of thesedeferments will be to reduce expenditure in 1965-66 by some  40 million and in 1966-67 by about  60 million. In addition to this the deferment ofexpenditure by Government Departments on stores and equipment will lead to further savings of  7 million in 1965-66 and  6 million in 1966-67.60. The Chancellor wrote to the chairmen of the nationalised industriesdrawing their attention to the measures being taken to restrain expenditurein the public sector and asking for their co-operation in comparable measures.He made it clear that he was not asking for postponement of projects whichwere essential to economic growth over the next few years. As a result the chairmen have offered to defer expenditure of the order of  60 million.61. In the development of the long-term programmes the question ofphasing will recur, for public expenditure is too large an element in thenational economy to be treated entirely on a long-term basis independently of the short-term economic situation.62. It was made clear in the National Plan* that the successful accom-plishment of these programmes is contingent upon the success of the economy in developing along the lines indicated in the Plan. It will benecessary for the Government to control the phasing of the public expendi-ture programmes within the general limit of the average increase of 4 per cent a year at constant prices over the five-year period so that the load on the economy which they represent does not increase faster than the economy can bear.63. In conclusion, the Government has two approaches to the problemof expenditure planning and control, one the relatively long-term and one the short-term. The decisions establishing limits for the main programmes for1969-70 have provided a framework for the development of these services,and enable the Ministers in charge of these services to make their prioritychoices and plan ahead. This covers most of the field, and should ensurethat these main services will be expanded on a scale which can be accom-accommodated within the country&apos;s resources and taxable capacity. Once thetotal has been established, to spend more on one item means spending lesson something else ; and this is a true system of economic and social priorities.It is for debate and discussion how these choices should be modified in theyears ahead.64. The problem is at the same time tackled for the short-term, with thepurpose of containing expenditure in 1966-67 within a reasonable limit. Forthe expenditure under direct Government control, the Estimates for 1966-67are the crucial point, and limits have been established within which each department is required to prepare its Estimate. The Governments object isto ensure that total public sector expenditure in 1966-67 does not exceed that* The National Plan, page 181.
4JLof 1965-66 at constant prices by more than 4  per cent; and the limitswithin which the Departments have framed their Estimates were prepared with this intention; but the total of Estimates in any one year is alwaysliable to fluctuations as a result of the movement of those items which canvary widely according to the economic or international situation, and the increases in costs, which are bound to make the increase in money termssubstantially more, must of cause be taken into account when the total is determined.65. The Survey of public sector expenditure is an annual one, and the1966 operation will decide what aggregate increase over the level establised for 1969-70 will be practicable for 1970-71, and how this is to be allocatedbetween the main programmes. This is how part of the Plan will rollforward another year, with guidelines for the development of the mainservices for a further year ahead. At the other end of the time-scale, decisions will be taken on the limits for 1967-68, which will again be the basis forthe work on the Estimates in the autumn of 1966. As the process becomesmore firmly established, the Survey and allocation operation will increasinglytake the form of a determination of long-term strategy in the outlay of public sector expenditure, brought to a point of decision in the allocation betweenthe main programmes for the fifth year ahead, and the fixing of the limit forthe short-term need for cash for the Estimates for the year immediately ahead.
APPENDIX statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on PublicExpenditureExtract from the Budget Statement, Wth November, 1964(O.R. Cols. 1029-31)[Mr. Callaghan]The expenditure programmes that we found in being for defence, thesocial services, houses, schools, hospitals, roads, will all entail substantially increased expenditure every year. By 1968 the total expenditure in thepublic sector will be  2,000 million more than it is today, without making any allowance for increased prices in the interim. This future expenditure is based on the revenue and savings that would accrue from a growth rate of4 per cent in our gross national product. Hon. Members will know that theaverage annual increase in our national product over the last five or six years has been only about 3 per cent, or a little less, and over the whole period from 1951 onwards has been no more than 2\ per cent.Putting it another way, the previous Administration have pledged our future revenues for the next four years on the basis of an underlying growth rate that they did not achieve and, looking at their record, they were unlikely to achieve. Of course, it is possible that the previous Government wouldhave achieved and maintained a 4 per cent growth rate for the next fouryears in a row. I do not say that miracles cannot happen, but the pro-grammes that we have taken over have been planned on the assumption thatthe miracles have already happened. Many of these programmes current and capital are, in practical terms, already committed. It will take timeto reshape them, but we intend to do this.Our first objective is to get the deployment of economic resources right.For example, large and important parts of our industrial and technologicalmanpower and capacity are locked up in production and research for theGovernment. It will be our urgent task to see how far this pattern shouldbe modified in the national interest so as to release resources for more productive purposes and for the expansion of exports. Defence will bein the forefront of this examination. This year&apos;s figure is over  2,000 million,of which  350 million is spent overseas and is a direct burden on the balanceof payments. This is the important point. The failure to secure value for money in the defence field has become a byword throughout the country:by relating commitments to resources it is our intention to ensure that the armed Forces are able to discharge their task with greater effectiveness and economy.We shall also examine those Government expenditures in the civjl field which have an economic aspect to ensure that an adequate economic andfinancial return can be secured for the industrial and scientific manpower and capital which they absorb. The purpose of much of this expenditure is sound enough and it is not our intention to hack it with a meat chopper.In the first instance, therefore, we intend to ask a task group of senior officials including scientific and economic advisers to sort out these projects and appraise their economic priority. We shall then have a firm basis for action.
Next, my hon. Friend the Chief Secretary will be reviewing the remainingfield of civil expenditure and I have asked him to consider whether the priorities at present established are right or whether it is possible for theGovernment to release valuable men and plant for work which will strengthen the balance of payments and help expanding industry. We are looking forall economies, not just tiny economies, although it must be part of the chief secretary&apos;s task to try to get rid of the kind of waste to which the comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention in recent years. But our basicobjective is to find substantial cases where expenditure is not yielding full value in social and economic terms.To turn to the other side of the medal, there are, clearly, fields in which increased expenditure by the Government can help the modernisation of the economy and the improvement of the rate of technical progress. The helpthat is being given to ensure more rapid development in the under-employedareas of the country is a good example of this. I very much welcome thediscussions which my right hon. Friends the First Secretary and the Ministerof Labour are about to have with industry to help men move easily fromjobs where productivity is relatively low and opportunities are few to more productive and progressive employment.Extract from a Statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 22ndFebruary, 1965, about Supply Expenditure, 1965-66[O.R. Cols. 35-37][Mr. Callaghan]The Vote on Account, covering the Civil Estimates and the Defence(Central) Estimate, is being published this afternoon ... It is the Govern-ment&apos;s task to plan the purposive use of our economic resources as a whole,in order to secure, first, that total expenditure both public and private matchesthe resources that can be made available, and, second, that within the totalthere is a proper balance between the requirements of the public and private sectors. This means that the public sector may need to absorb a larger shareof our gross national product than it does today. But the growth of public expenditure must be effectively controlled so that social and economicpriorities can be duly secured in the National Economic Development plan which the Government are preparing.We have accordingly been considering the problem of planning the longer-term course not only of Central Government expenditure, but of thetotal expenditure of the whole public sector. A final decision on the detailsof this will be reached when the plan has been drawn up. Meanwhile, theGovernment have decided that the growth of public sector expenditure between 1964-65 and 1969-70, excluding the investment of the nationalised industries, will be related to the prospective increase in national production,which in our present judgment means limiting the average increase in public sector expenditure, taking one year with another, to 4^ per cent a year at constant prices. This will mean a corresponding containment of the risein private sector expenditure. Only as a nation succeeds in raising theannual rate of production can public and private expenditure be increased.These decisions will provide a sound base for our policies for modernisingand expanding the national resources. They will also permit the progres-sive development of our economic and social policies, because expenditure will be realistically related to our capacity to embark upon new plans.
Extract from the Budget Statement on 6th April, 1965[O.R. Cols. 279-281]PUBLIC EXPENDITURE[Mr. Callaghan]I now come to public expenditure. Both in my statement of 22ndFebruary and in my opening remarks today I have made it clear that it is our intention to plan the use of economic resources and to control the growth of public expenditure so that the right balance of economic and socialpriorities can be duly secured. The control of public expenditure will thereforebe used positively as well as negatively. The Government have decided thatthe growth of public expenditure between 1964-65 and 1969-70 will be related to the prospective increase in national production. In the Govera-menfs present judgment this means limiting the overall increase in public sector expenditure excluding the investment of the nationalised industries,and taking one year with another, to 4  per cent a year at constant prices.We are examining the whole of public expenditure again in order to determinea proper order of priorities and to control waste.In the field of defence, reviews are being conducted to ascertain the chEtngesthat would be required to contain expenditure at roughly the 1964-65 figure in real terms. One of the most serious aspects of this problem is the growth of overseas military expenditure. This includes maintaining our troops inGermany, the Middle East and the Far East. Since 1959 I ask the Committeeto note these figures this total has gone up year by year without let orhindrance from about  175 million to over  300 million, including defence aid.These payments across the exchanges constitute a serious drain on our balanceof payments. A reduction in them depends upon others as well as ourselves,but the economy badly needs some of the foreign exchange resources absorbed by the defence programme; and the Government intend to secure a reductionin the existing burden.Altogether, about 1  million men and women are employed in the forces and in industry to supply them. These are important and scarce resourcesof manpower, needed for industrial expansion and for exports. It is against this background that the Government have had to consider the future ofthe TSR2 project. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defencehopes to catch your eye later in the debate this evening, Dr. King, in orderto make a full statement about the Governments policy and its decision to cancel the project.The effect of this decision is to save  35 million of Government expenditurein 1965-66, after taking account of the terminal costs which may becomedue to be paid this year. But, so far, this aircraft has cost  125 million, andthe cost is mounting fast every week. It has, and would have, divertedhundreds of factories employing thousands of skilled and semi-skilled menfrom other work of national importance, including exports in particular.This is not a sensible use of our overstrained resources. The government&apos;s decision will, in the next five years, release  350 million of resources of an advanced kind for more productive work.On expenditure in industry, my colleagues&apos; statements in the last fewdays about postal charges, railway closures and agricultural supportdemonstrate our policy and we do not intend to be moved from it that
these industries should continue to increase their contribution to the national economy. Where we believe that Government expenditure can have a constructive and fertilising effect on industry, we have shown ourselves readyto make the money available. In education, in health, in social security and in housing we are engaged in arranging our priorities so that we can get the best combination of programmes and the best value for moneywithin the expenditure which can be devoted to these purposes.Side by side with this is the review of local government finance which is going on, which will enable us to decide how the expenditure on the public services can best be shared between central and local sources of finance. Itis no easy matter to reshape public expenditure in a short time and wemust look further ahead than just the current year if we are to make a realimpact on these expenditures. But I commend to the Committee, and especially to my hon. Friends, the words of Robert Owen:&quot; Beneficial changes can alone take place by well digested and wellarranged plans temperately introduced and perseveringly pursued.&quot;I know only too well, as my predecessors did, of the pressure for higherpensions and for better pay ; and I do not need to recall to any hon. Memberthe recent outcry about the state of some of our schools, the condition ofsome of our hospitals and the wretchedness of some of London&apos;s housing.My earnest wish is to see the nation freely and willingly devoting thenecessary resources to satisfying the simple needs of ordinary men andwomen a home to live in, a school to learn in, a hospital when we aresick and a modest living for the elderly. But the fulfilment of these plansjostles against the need for a healthy balance of payments as well as thedesire by all of us as individuals for an increase in our own personalstandards of living.For the reasons which I gave at the outset, in 1965 first priority mustbe given to balancing our overseas payments. I have already indicated themanner in which we are setting about this. Until we get this, we shall need to contain the rise in private expenditure. For the rest, a healthy balanceof payments is necessary to enable the economy to grow at a steady pace.Our most important task is to reconcile faster growth with a satisfactorybalance of payments. We look to the economic plan which is now being prepared to co-ordinate the conflicting claims made upon our resources by private expenditure, social expenditure, defence and industrial investment;and also to stimulate the economy into greater efficiency and productivity.Extract from a Statement by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 21th July, 1965[O.R. Cols. 228-30][Mr. Callaghan]. . . This year&apos;s balance of payments deficit is likely to be well below halflast year&apos;s figure. To ensure that we reach our aim of eliminating the deficit inthe course of next year and of maintaining the strength of sterling, theGovernment have decided to adopt the following measures.First, expenditure at home. The Government intend to slow down therate of expenditure on capital projects and to defer as far as possible
purchases of equipment and stores by Government Departments, localauthorities and nationalised industries.Housing, schools and hospitals will be contained within their existing programmes. For other non-industrial capital projects for which contracts have not yet been signed, the starting dates will be postponed for six months.Exemptions will be made for projects in development districts and areas of high unemployment. Similarly, purchases of goods will be deferred to themaximum possible extent.All Government Departments have been instructed to carry out this policyand to arrange for other bodies for which they are responsible to do likewise.The nationalised industries will be called on to follow a similar course ofaction.   Local authorities will be asked to follow suit.Loan sanction and grants will only be given to local authority projects which are urgently required. In particular, sanction will not be given exceptin special circumstances to loans for expenditure on land purchases inadvance of requirements, on civil buildings, offices and a variety of miscel-laneous projects which, though desirable in themselves, are not essential atthis time. The expenditure in these categories is now running at  150 million a year.Lending by local authorities on mortgage for house purchase has trebledin England and Wales in the last five years, and in 1964-65 reached 180 million. With the co-operation of the local authorities this will be restricted to the average of the three years ended 31st March, 1965, namely, 130 million.The House will recall that last spring I undertook to review the swollenprogrammes of public expenditure left behind by our predecessors. this review is now complete. As I forecast before the election, the examinationrevealed that it would not be possible to carry out all the programmes weinherited within the limits of our resources until the necessary rate of growth of production has been achieved. We have, accordingly, reshaped the total programme and I can inform the House that from now on expenditure willbe kept to the level that we as a nation can afford. I am giving instructionsto Departments that the 1966-67 Estimates shall be drawn up within a limit which has been determined for each Department within the agreed total.....APPENDIX IICriteria for the Appraisal of Civil Technological ProjectsIntroduction1. Every civil technological project, however small, should be sanctionedonly if it represents a worthwhile expenditure of resources ; but the processof appraisal assumes even greater importance when the proposal is likelyto engage a substantial part of the available funds, facilities and manpower,or when a choice must be made between two or more projects whichcompete for such resources. This memorandum has been prepared to helpin making assessments of the economic and technological merits of pro-posed research and development projects and in weighing the priority of one project against another. Those questions which cannot be answeredquantitatively may be considered in qualitative terms.   It is not expected
that every worthwhile project will fulfil all the requirements. For eachproject, some criteria will be more important than others, and the judgmentmust be made on the merits of the case as a whole.2. Both technical and economic criteria must be taken into account ;and when there is a proposal for collaboration with other countries, account must be taken of international considerations.Technical Evaluation3. First, the technical evaluation of a project should normally be basedon an outline research and development programme in which the objectives and duration of each stage (exploratory, feasibility and development) are clearly set out. Has the programme been drawn up so that it can be termin-ated on review at the end of any stage, and has the contract been framedaccordingly? Have the prospective user(s) of the final product and those responsible for the project worked closely together to determine the require-ments and define them as specifically as possible?4. Second, is the project highly advanced, scientifically and technically?If not, it will normally have to stand or fall solely on its economic merits.If it is highly advanced, the following are the questions:  (i) What is its scientific feasibility? Is the basic science well established?Does it depend on a single advance not yet assured, or on severalsuch advances?(ii) To what extent does it go beyond present technological experience?Does it, for example, depend on new materials, new manufacturingtechniques, or involve new operating conditions? Do these innovations-tions in turn depend on further basic scientific work or long-termtechnical studies?(iii) Are there alternative technical routes, in case some of the criticalsteps prove intractable? Will these alternatives be studied in parallelor in sequence?(iv) Have working models of the product been built and operated success-fully? In what respects will the finished product operate underdifferent conditions and for different lengths of time than these?Are these differences expected to raise further scientific or technical problems?(v) Would there be competition from other countries, and where researchhas been done abroad, could the results be obtained more economic-ally through licensing arrangements?5. Third, what scale and quality of manpower and capital facilities arerequired for research, development, design, test evaluation and production ;and what resources could be made available for the project? Are these resources over-stretched or under-used at the present time? To what extentv/ill the project be in competition with other projects for the same resources?Would the project strengthen the research and development capacity of theindustry?6. Fourth, if the research and development is successful:  (i) Will the production require workers with special skills?   Are theseavailable, or have plans been made to acquire or train the necessarypeople?
(ii) Will the production require special manufacturing equipment in short supply or available only by import?(iii) Will the product have to be constructed from special materialsor components, which are scarce or must be imported?7. Fifth, is the research organisation or manufacturer capable of carryingout the work efficiently and reliably and within whatever cost and time limitsare specified? For example, is there a critical path programme for the pro-ject? What standards of quality will be set and how will quality be controlled?Are there adequate facilities and programmes for testing? If this is the firstproject of its kind, has allowance been made for the inexperience of thosecarrying out the feasibility and project studies?Economic A ppraisal8. First, what is the economic purpose of the product resulting from the project, and in particular:  (i) Is it to satisfy a commercial market which is reasonably certain to exist, or a commercial market which must at present be regardedas conjectural, or a non-commercial i.e. Governmental-market(e.g. defence, basic research)?(ii) What is the nature of the competition for these markets?(iii) What contribution can the project be expected to make to theeconomic recovery of the country within the next five or ten years?9. Second, what are the prospects for a rapid application if the develop-ment is successful? What are the factors in the industry or in the market which would help or hinder this?10. Third, what is the financial cost of the project, capital and current,year by year ; and what is the expected financial return on the cost, assuming-ing the project is successful? When the return is a long way ahead, this must be properly taken into account in the rate at which future earnings arediscounted ; normally a rate of 8 per cent, should be taken. If the contractis to be placed with a private firm, the extent of their willingness to invest theirown money in it should be given considerable weight.11. Fourth, what should be the effect of the project upon the balance ofpayments, both at the outset and in the future?12. Fifth, what are the potential gains to other firms and industriesthrough the advance in technology and productivity that the project may bringabout if it is successful? Would the undertaking of the project itself leadto desirable changes in industrial structure? Would the project be an indirectsupport to exports by strengthening industrial prestige?13. Sixth, does the Ministry of Defence expect the project to have signifi-cant defence application? If so, part or all of the cost will normally fallon the Defence Budget.14. Seventh, what contribution would the project make to basic science?If this was the main result the project would normally be financed by the research Councils and other sources of funds for scientific research.15. Eighth, these various costs and benefits, both the estimated financialreturn on the project itself and the wider costs and benefits to the economy generally, will often be difficult to quantify ; but it is necessary nevertheless
to list them systematically. It is also necessary to consider whether risks. would be incurred or damage suffered by the national economy if the project was not undertaken ; and whether the avoidance of such risks or damage would be commensurate with the cost of the resources which wouldbe employed.International Considerations16. When projects involving international collaboration are considered,some additional questions are necessary. It is often more costly to carryout research and development on a collaborative rather than a national basis,and multilateral collaboration may be more costly than bilateral: it is there-fore necessary to compare the costs and benefits of collaborative action withthose of independent national action.17. First, are the scale and nature of the resources involved, both to launchthe project successfully and to meet competition from elsewhere, beyond thescope of this country alone?18. Second, to what extent are the prospective partner-countries inter-dependent in research and development in the relevant fields? Each country will normally have made some progress in the field. Do their relativepositions make for easy collaboration? A great disparity is in generalundesirable.19. Third, do the countries have a common interest in the project, and what are their respective needs for knowledge, experience, facilities andmarkets in relation to it? What arrangements will there be for collaborationand sharing in the development (if the project is for research only), produc-tion and marketing of the product if the project is successfully completed?Would collaboration in any case lead to a desirable broadening of theindustrial base, a satisfactory sharing of costs, and wider assured markets?20. Fourth, what is the nature of the financial arrangements in the pro-posed partner-countries, and what is their suitability for getting realisticdecisions at critical points in the development of project? Does the draft agreement include suitable break clauses so that the programme can ifnecessary be terminated at the end of any stage in the development?21. Finally, what is the importance of the project for foreign policy?

The total is that which the Government decided to contain within an average increase of 4.5: per cent a year at constant prices in the period 1964-65 to 1969-70.(2) The expenditure shown for each function is that of Great Britain spending authorities.The expenditure of Northern Ireland spending authorities is included in the last item under&quot; other programmes &quot;.(3) Estimates of summer 1965 at prices related to the Budget Estimates of 1965-66. this price basis is used for the 1969-70 figures also and is called &quot; 1965 Survey prices&quot;.(4) The figures for out-turn in 1964-65 agree with those in the table at the end of the 1965Blue Book on National Income and Expenditure showing the &quot;Treasury analysis of public expenditure &quot;, the diiterence in total being on account of the exclusion of the capital formationof nationalised industries, etc.(5) These are estimates for 1964-65 made for the Government&apos;s first analysis from whichthe &quot; 4i per cent &quot; decision was taken, adjusted to 1965 Survey prices (sec note (3) above).(6) The out-turn for 1964-65 is after deductions of large, special receipts in respect ofthe handing over of military assets in Kenya and Malta. The amount for 1969-70 is the equivalent, at 1965 Survey prices, of the ceiling of  2,000 million fixed for the defence budget at the prices of the 1964-65 Estimates.(7) Environmental services cover water supply, sewerage, refuse disposal, parks and pleasuregrounds and other miscellaneous services provided by local authorities.(8) This total does not take account of the deferment measures announced by the Govern-ment on 27th July, 1965, the effect of which can be expected to be a reduction of the order of 50 million in 1965-66 (see also paragraph 59 of main text above).

All current expenditure on theNational Health Service, net of revenue from charges raised, is included.Current expenditure on goods and services also includes defence expenditureon fixed assets (other than married quarters, ordnance factories, and other items with a potential civilian use) and building and construction expenditure overseas.Capital formation comprises all expenditure on fixed assets (with the exceptions noted in the immediately preceding paragraph), net of the proceedsfrom the sale of assets, by the central government, local authorities andcertain other public corporations. An allowance for the increase in thevalue of stocks is also included.Subsidies include the deficit grant paid to the British Railways and Water-ways Boards, all subsidies in support of agriculture and the housing subsidiespaid by the central government and local authorities.Current grants to persons, etc., comprise a wide variety of current transfer payments of which benefits and assistance paid to residents of the UnitedKingdom under the National Insurance and related schemes form the largestsingle item. Also included are awards to students, school meals (net ofparental contributions) and school milk, and grants in support of the current expenditure of the universities, voluntary schools, and other private non-profit-making institutions.Current grants abroad consist for the main part of grants to overseas governments under the aid programme; expenditure on certain UnitedKingdom-based institutions whose activities are directed to the needs of table public sector expenditure by economic category^)(excluding nationalised industries, etc.)

Thus the actual payments of social security benefits are included against either central government Vote-borne (Supply) expenditure or expenditure by the National Insurance Funds,depending upon the type of benefit; the Exchequer contribution to the Fund is however excluded, since this ranks as an internal transfer within the public sector. Similarly all expenditure by local authorities, irrespective of the way in which it is financed, appears against local authorities, while grants by the
central government to local authorities (estimated at  1,300 million in. 1965-66) are excluded. It follows therefore that, because of these transfersand various other transactions between Departments and the Exchequer, the element of total public expenditure by the central government on Votes willdiffer from the total of the published Estimates.
