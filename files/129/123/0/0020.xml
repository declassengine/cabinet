DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC I..AJE3TY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (65) 170 COPY-NO.       pfi6th December, 1965CABINETHOUSING PRC GRAMME 1965/66Memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentThe Secretary of State for &quot;Wales and I need urgently to know whatlevel of house-building by local authorities we can authorise during theremainder of this year and next.2.       &quot;When the Cabinet considered this in July last (C. C. (65) 43rdConclusions, Minute 3) the level of approvals for local authority building was left at 150,000 for this year, and the same for next;   though it wasagreed that I should keep this under review.3.       Since then three things have happened: -(i) We have announced cur intention to reach a United Kingdomoutput of somewhere near 250, 000 public sector houses by1970 as part of a total output of half a million.(ii)  We have announced new subsidies for local authority houses -with the result that requests for approvals, which have beenquiet while the authorities waited for this, will now comeflooding in.(iii)  An official group which has been studying the forward loan onconstructional capacity has reported (S,D.(65) 115) that,following the steps which have been taken to cut dov/ninessential work, demand in 1966 is likely to be some 55 million below productive potential.4.       My view is that the right plan now would be to let public sector housing rise slowly but steadily so that we should reach the 250, 000mark by 1970 without any jerks.     This would mean, for England andWales, a level of 156, 000 approvals this year,  161, 000 next - and so on by some 5,000 additional each year.    (Since this year has nearly run, theright way to secure this smooth progression would be to see the first stage of this as an addition of 17,000 approvals between now and fee endof next year, instead of pushing through as many as possible during therest of this month and then steadying. )5.       This has been considered by the Economic development committee and they concluded that an addition of 6, 000 approvals thisyear (as the Secretary of State and I proposed) and 6,000 next year (i. e.12, 000 between, now and the end of next year, instead of 17, 000) could beaccepted, provided that the distribution could be on a regional basisacceptable both to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself.    No-1-CONFIDENTIAL

1 k nX tj uquestion, I think, arises on the distribution;  I should be prepared to seeas many houses as is physically practicable built in the development areas, and also to provide for transferring industrial workers,especially coal-miners - which I am told is what the Chancellor wants.For the rest, my priority must be to provide for the conurbations wherethe need for rented housing is overwhelming.    But I understand thatthe Chancellor does not feel able, even so, to accept the total of12,000 additional approvals.6.       One issue is the amount of slack which is desirable in the buildingindustry;   12,000 additional approvals between now and the end of nextyear - which I am prepared to accept - would mean about  13 millionadditional work in 1966, and rather more in 1967.    But the other issue is whether we can afford to keep down house building by local authorities,having announced a  rising programme and having imposed buildinglicensing to make the rising programme possible.   Even if 12,000additional houses are authorised, I shall have to cut back hard the programmes of many authorities whose needs I judge to be not of firsturgency;  with less than 12, 000 I should have to cut back some whoseneeds are plainly very urgent.7.       It is essential that this should be decided now.    I must settleforward programmes with the main house-building authorities to coverat least three years ahead.    Only so can the authorities organise theirbuilding efficiently, and only so can I get the maximum use made ofindustrial systems.R. K. S.
