CONFIDENTIAL n ,THE SCOTTISH HOUSIIvG PROGRAMS1965 to 1970THE AIM1.     The National Plan^&quot;^ announced the Government1 s intention to give to housing a greater priority than it has had for many years   the rate of &quot;building will &quot;be increased with the initial aim of achieving a programme of half amillion houses a year in the United Kingdom &quot;by 1970.     Scotland&apos;s shareof this total will &quot;be about 50,000 houses a year, an increase of 40 per cent.over the 19&amp;4 level.The need2.   The number of new houses needed in Scotland cannot yet be estimated, (2)5 hut it is clear that by any standard a vast programme isprecisely   &apos; &quot;essential if past deficiencies are to he overcome and present and future needsadequately met.3.   At present there are in Scotland about if million houses.     Although theneed for replacement of a house cannot he related to its age - some very oldhouses have been or could he improved to modern standards - the mere factthat half a million are over eighty years old clearly indicates the need fora substantial programme of replacement.     In their most recent slum clearanceprogrammes, submitted in response to a circular from the Scottish DevelopmentDepartment of December 1964? &quot;k-ie local authorities are proposing to accelerate the rate of clearance and to close or demolish some 45*000 unfit houses duringthe three years 1965 to 1967.     They estimate that about the same number againare in such condition that they should he demolished as soon as resourcespermit.     This is not, however, any real measure of the total need for replacement of unfit and obsolescent houses.     A very high proportion of the older houses are in stone tenements and consist of only one or two rooms;and most have no fised hath, hot water tap or separate w.c. or lack at least one of these essentials.     Although many of them are solidly constructedand might well stand for many years, this solidity is the very factor whichmilitates against attempts to bring them up to modern standards of size andamenity, and in most cases nothing short of replacement is practicable.1.(l)   Cmnd. 2764, Chapter 17.(2)   See Appendix A

4.     Eaoh year it is necessary to demolish some houses which would havehad a useful further life;    this happens, for example, as a consequence of comprehensive redevelopment of slum areas or of new road schemes.     There alsoremain some 18,000 temporary houses &quot;built after the Second Yiorld War whichmust be replaced soon.5.     In addition there is the need arising from the increase since the Warin the number of families wanting a home of their own, an increase whichlargely reflects the trend towards earlier marriage, which is still continuing.The demand would have been greater if the net rate of migration from Scotland -now running at 40,000 persons a year - had not been so large.     The Government1seconomic policies for Scotland, as they will be defined in a White Paper on theScottish Economy 1965 to 1970, to be published shortly, will have as their aimthe creation of more employment opportunities in Scotland, resulting in lowerunemployment and higher activity rates and a substantial reduction in theloss of population by emigration.     For all these purposes much will dependon a higher degree of mobility of labour and this, in turn, will call for new housing on a substantial scale in support of economic growth, particularlyin Central Scotland.6.     Broadly, the requirement for new houses over the next few years isestimated as follows -existing now(i)    up to 500,000 to replace houses already.dy identified as slums or toreplace old houses not capable of improvement;(ii)    at least 30,000 to meet present shortages;a.^sing ^annually(iii)   3,000 a year to replace other losses;(iv)   17,000 a year to keep up with the forms/tion of new households;(v)    5,000 a year to meet additional industrial requirements and reduce emigration.A programme of 50,000 houses a year can be only a first step towards meetingall these requirements.-2.

see Appendix B.Cmnd. 2771jjQ^f-S A0, ?ze.t -    .CQr. ii&amp;ke.7.     Of the 550,000 houses built in Scotland since the War only 75,000 were for private owners, almost exclusively for owner-occupation.     The remaining475,000 have been erected by public authorities - the local authorities, thenew town corporations, the Scottish Special Housing Association and Governmentdepartments - almost exclusively for letting.     The proportion of private housing has increased steadily since the &apos;,.ar, hut the number built for theprivate sector in any year has never exceeded about one-fifth of the totalThis is in marked contrast to many parts of the United Kingdom, in which morehouses have been built for owner-occupation than by the public authorities.The G-overnement consider that there is a large potential demand for owner-occupation in Scotland.     In particular the building of many attractive houses for sale will he essential if industry is to be induced to grow in Scotland..8.     There is however an even greater need for new houses to let.     The presentshortages fall most heavily on those who are least able to pay an economicprice for modern accommodation.     These are the people who at present live in overcrowded and unsatisfactory conditions.     The local authorities have so far done a commendable job in building houses for letting at moderaterents to people who cannot afford either to buy a. house or to pay the fulleconomic rent of a modern house.     But in many parts of the country the demand is still formidable and the programme of building by public authorities mustbe accelerated.9.     The Government intend to keep both the total programme of house-building and its division in Scotland between the public and private sectors under constant review.     Their present expectation is that in the years immediately ahead the Scottish private sector will provide one house for sale for everythree or four provided by the public sector for letting.     representative the building-bodies of/societies and builders have agreed to join in planning andprogramming building for owner-occupation throughout Great Britain alonglines which are explained in the Paper &quot;The Housing Programme 19^5 to 1970presented concurrently by the Secretary of State for Wales and the Ministercf housing and local government.3.

MffiEDAJJ^CJ; ACTION10.    The building of 50,000 houses a year will not be achieved easily.     Itwill call for increased efficiency in the construction industry and the betteruse of the industry&apos;s resources;    for more money from the taxpayer;    for better organisation of the house-building authorities;    and for the provisionof enough land in the right places at the right times.     At the same time- a proper share of building resources must be devoted to the maintenance, repair and improvement of older houses.^&quot;Li^e-&quot;^-l-\J:^5  J^sources11.   A heavy additional load will be placed on the construction industry.It clearly will not be able, within the period to 1970, to secure a sufficientexpansion of the skilled labour force to achieve the increased output requiredsimply by employing more men.     There must also be a substantial increase of productivity, so as to increase the industry&apos;s output without a proportionate increase of labour.12.    Much can be done by rationalisation of traditional building methods, andby better management at all levels, to secure reductions of time, labour and cost in house-building.     There must also be rapidly increasing use of thenewer methods of house-building by systems, involving the carefully plannedassembly on site of factory-made components.     The programme for 1970 will be within the capacity of the industry only if by then a considerably higher proportion of the houses erected for public authorities are being system-built.Finance13.   The necessary expansion of house-building will not be achieved withoutmore help from the taxpayer.     In recent years the cost of house-building has risen markedly and for the last eight years interest rates have been at apersistently high level.14.   Together these two factors have created particular problems for the localauthorities, for whom loan charges on capital expenditure are the heaviestpart of the annual costs of housing.     These annual costs are shared by the

taxpayer, the ratepayer and the tenants of the houses.     In recent years the proportion met by the taxpayer through the Exchequer subsidies has beeninsufficient to keep pace with rises in the costs.     Rents charged to tenantshave on average more than doubled over aperiod of seven years, hut still meetonly 40 per cent of costs.     The share met by the local ratepayer (with, insome cases, assistance from Exchequer equalisation grant) has been steadilyrising and was of the order of  20 million in 1964-65.     It is greatly to the credit of the local authorities that they have continued to build as fast asthey have done despite this very heavy burden on the rates.     Nevertheless,if they are to be able to carry out the expanded house-building programmes which are essential, it is necessary to case the rate burden by improving theExchequer subsidies and by pursuing sensible rent policies.15.   Because of the uncertainty caused by high and sometimes sharply fluctuatinrates of interest, the Government propose, after consultation with the scottish local authority associations, that the main Exchequer subsidy should be related to a stable interest rate of 4 per cent.     Each local authority will receive a basic subsidy on newly-built houses, calculated so as to produce broadly the same effect on its housing account as though the loans raised to financetheir construction had borne interest at 4 per cent per annum.     Boing related to the capital cost of completed houses, the basic subsidy will vary with thatcost;    end, of course, it will vary with the prevailing rates of interest.Direct comparison with the present rates of subsidy is therefore not possible;but the improvement over present rates will be substantial.     Further detailsof the basic subsidy and of the supplementary subsidies which will be paid forcertain purposes are given in iippendix C*16.   The Scottish Special Housing Association and the new town development corporations are wholly Exchequer-financed, no part of their deficit falling on the local ratepayers.     It has been the practice to pay them broadly similarsubsidies to those payable to the local authorities, and they will receive the basic subsidy and those of the additional subsidies which are relevant.5.

Boldlype6.17*   These improved subsidy arrangements will apply to all houses in respect ofwhich tenders are submitted for the Secretary of State&apos;s approval on or after thedate of presentation of this Paper.18.   The purpose of the new subsidies is to provide a proper amount of government support to enable the expanded housing programme to be carried out without placingtoo heavy a burden on the local authorities.     It is proper that rents ofsubsidised houses should be revised at frequent intervals to take account of changing circumstances, particularly rising incomes.     The more generoussubsidies now to be provided create an opportunity for all authorities to review their rent policies so as to ensure that reasonable levels of rents and adequaterent rebate schemes avoid hardship and unfairness to local authority tenants andratepayers alike.19*   The problem of high cost and high interest rates affect not only the public authorities but also potential owner-occupiers, though for -them the deterrentcf high interest rates is lessened by income tax relief on their interest payments.The Government are anxious to entourage house ownership by as many as possible andas soon as the country&apos;s economic situation allows they will publish their plans for bringing owner-occupation within the reach of more families.Imjjr removed J^rganis^atiqn.20.   If the public house-building authorities are to accomplish their tasks, withthe full co-operation of the construction industry, it will be necessary to planmuch further ahead -than in the past.     Some 80 - 90 per cent of the houses in thepublic sector will be built by about fifty major local authorities, the Scottish,Special Housing Association and the new town development corporations.     Thelj alreadyjj Scottish Development Department will work out with all these authorities (as they/talicsijhave with several) provisional programmes for a period of about five years ahead.In doing so the Department will take account of the substantially differing needsof the various areas and of the rate of house-building which each authority can reasonably be expected to achieve.     The1proportion of system building to beused will be a major factor in determining the practicable size of these programmes.

Italics21.     In the existing major centres of population - and particularly inthe Glasgow conurbation - the land available for housing development is rapidly diminishing and the emphasis must increasingly be placed on the redevelopment of existing areas.     Many of the houses which will bereplaced are so small and crowded together that it will be impossible with reasonable standards of planning and amenity to replace them with the same number of modern houses.     Furthermore, the growth of industry in scotland will require a substantial   provision of houses in places where theexisting stock is inadequate for such growth.     The existing New Towns willhave an increasing contribution to make, and the Government are considering whether another should be designated.     Elsewhere the programme of housingrequired may well be beyond the capacity of the local authority or authorities concerned and the Government consider it appropriate that they should provide additional assistance in such areas, through the agency of the scottish special Housing Association.22.     The carrying out of the expanded programme, and particularly the wider adoption of system building, will require a new outlook on thepart of all the public authorities concerned.     Substantial productivecapacity already exists, or is being provided, in Scotland by a number ofmanufa.cturers of various house-building systems.     In most instances the initial costs of providing this capacity are heavy, and prices which arecompetitive with the cost of the more traditional forms of building can be offered only if the manufacturers can be assured of sizeable orders, and a steady run of work.     It is therefore of the utmost importance that public authorities should be prepared to join together in the arrangement of groupprogrammes which will make full use on a planned basis of the systems whichcafca.. available.    The Scottish Development Department, in collaboration withthe National Building Agency, will seek to identify with the authorities the projects which might be included in such group programmes;   to assist themiin the programming of projects;   and to help them to choose the systems best suited to their needs.     Group programmes of this sort can make the best use

of productive capacity and keep costs down to a reasonable level only if theauthorities concerned are prepared to limit variations on points of detail inthe planning of individual houses.     The range of house-types and variety offinishes which the manufacturers can offer, together with attention to goodlayout and planning of each estate as a whole, can ensure that dullness anduniformity do not mar the estates built under these programmes.Land.23.   A rising housing programme can be sustained only if sufficientbuilding land is available.     To be able to plan building programmes, both public authorities and private builders need to know, well in advance, whereand when they will be able to build.     The necessary steps must therefore betaken in good time to allocate and acquire the land, to clear it ifnecessary and to provide the services it will need.     As well as the forward planning of building in the public sector, already referred to in paragraph 20,there must be a forward programme of land identification and acquisition bylocal authorities.     The Scottish Development Department will maintain andjthat these programmes keep well ahead of the start of house-building.24*   Local authorities and New Town Corporations have power to buy land,compulsorily if need be, for house-building whether by themselves or by privatedevelopment.     In order to ensure a balanced house-building programme thelocal authorities will be asked to use their powers, where necessary, to ensurethat private builders as well as the local authorities can acquire land in good time.25*   The Land Commission which has already been announced ^, with power to buy land where this is necessary to secure its early development or redevelopment, is an essential part of the Government&apos;s Plans for housing.The Commission&apos;s powers will ensure that land is forthcoming as and when needed for housing purposes, and the Commission will be able, in appropriate cases, toItalic slievelop their existingg consultations with the local authorities to ensure8.Cmnd. 2771

dispose of land for houses for owner-ocoupa iion on concessionary terms.26.   The foregoing paragraphs have been concerned mainly with the building ofnew houses.     But the present stock of I5 million houses includes many whichcannot be replaced for a long time to come, although they are not up to modernstandards.     It is of the greatest importance that both local authorities andprnva.te owners should make vigorous efforts to take advantage of the Exchequerassistance which is available under present legislation to enable improvements tobe made to these houses.     The maintenance and repair tf houses must also not beneglected.     For the public sector this is one aspect of the whole question of management of houses which the Secretary of State has remitted for considerationby the recently-reconstituted Scottish housing Advisory Committee.     As forrented houses in the private sector, the new form of rent control intrcduced by the rent Act 1 965 is designed to he more flexible and fair, both to landlords and to tenants, than previous controls and ought to encourage landlords to maintainadequately the houses they own.EOTCLUSION27. r.Thai first part of this Paper sets uut the G-overnment1 s aim, and describes the circumstances in which they have decided to accord priority to an expandedhouse-building programme.     In Scotland a programme rising to 50,000 houses ayear by 197* is projected.     This is only the first stage of a developijsrg, plan;as more information becomes available it will he carried forward with increasingmomentum end precision.28.    The second part describes the action proposed to attain the initial objective.It will call for whole-hearted co-operation between all concerned - house-builders,local and central house-building authorities and many other agencies and individuals.With this concerted effort, which they intend to bring about, the Government believethat in the new few years great progress car be ma.de towards housing the people ofScotland decently and well.9.

appendix aBETTER &apos; information.     The problem of obtaining, and still more of keeping up-to-date, adequatebasic information about housing conditions and progress is being carefully studiedand steps are being taken both to make good the immediate deficiencies in knowledge and also to provide a continuous flow of information.2.     The -]96&apos;i Census contained a wider range of information about housingthan previous censuses.     a further sample census, covering a similar range of housing information, is to be taken in 1966.     These, taken together, willmaterially improve knowledge of the number of houses in Scotland, their condition,tenure and oc cup tin cy G-nd of how these factors are changing, but the time betweencensuses, even if reduced to five years, is too long to give an entirely satisfactorypicture of the changing situation.3.     Census results must therefore be supplemented.     For this reason a sample survey has recently been carried out in Scotland on behalf of the scottish development Department and a similar sample survey has been carried out in G-lasgowfor the Corporation.     The results of these two surveys, which have been closelyco-ordinated, will be available early in 1966.     Further regular surveys will beundertaken in the future on a scale sufficient to provide indications of the mostimportant trends.4.     Perhaps the most difficult gap in information concerns the condition ofhouses.   One reason for this is the absence of any cor.mon standard by reference tov;hich assessments can be made of fitness for habitation and of potentiali-cy for improvement.     The Scottish Housing Advisory Committee has set up a sub-ionmitteeto examine the f ormulatior. of such standards and their work should enable the stateof Scotland&apos;s housing to be more precisely evaluated.5.     More information is needed also on the way in which the stock of housesis used.     The sample survey will give current information aibout occupancy.     Butan important aspect of this question is the way in which tenants are chosen for houses available for letting.     This is of particular importance in relation to &quot;cheneed in Scotland for greater rrcbility of labour.     As most houses for letting areowned by local authorities, a sub-committee of the Scottish Housing AdvisoryCommittee has been set up to examine the methods by which the authorities allocate(1)

their houses.     At the same time the Scottish Housing Advisory Committee itself is considering the whole question of providing houses to meet the needs ofindustry.6.     It is important that as much as possible of the new information collected in these ways should be generally available.     The results of the sample survey willbe published and the possibility of publishing a wider range of housing statistics isbeing examined.(2)CONFIDENTIALN



5 oNBCT; SUBSIPISSJ^CJLLOCiJ; aUTKCPJTY HOUSING-1.     The J,ill*   A Bill will be introduced during the present Session ofParliament to provide for a new subsidy structure in Scotland.   The broad,framework is set out in the following paragraphs.2.     Bajsic _o.nl ^^^ entar^ .stibsidi^s.   The new subsidies will comprise -(a) A basic subsidy(b) Supplementary subsidies where appropriate for(i)    expensive sites(ii)   high flats(iii)   overspill(iv)   building in special materials(v)   precautions against subsidence,(vi)   special needs3*   Period of^subjgjfliesj:\ndjnaview*   The new subsidies will apply to houses for which tenders are received for approval by the Secretary of State following the date of presentation of the Paper,    accept for the overspill supplement(paragraph 5(b)) they will be payable for 60 years, subject to provision for possible review from time to time./;..     The basic^ubsidy,.   An entirely new form of basic subsidy will take theplace of the unit subsidy (normally .-s32 a house but less or more in some instances) payable under existing legislation.It will be calculated in respect of all approve.! dwellings completed in any financial year and will take the form of a contribution towards the loan chargesincurred in financing their capital cost (including land).   The subsidy will be calculated as the difference between loan charges payable on loans of the amountof the capital costs at current rate of interest and at A per cent,   lor these purposes the current rate of interest for any year&apos;s subsidy calculation will bedetermined by the Secretary of State as representing the average rate of interestpaid on new loans raised by local authorities in the preceding year.(i)

5.     Supplementary subsidies(a) The subsidies for expensive sites, high flats, precautions againstsubsidence and building in special materials will be on the same general lines as those payable for these purposes under existing legislation but there will he some detailed changes in the formulaefor calculating them and in the qualifying conditions.(b) Dwellings built by receiving authorities under overspill agreementswill qualify for additional Exchequer subsidy of  12f a year for aperiod of 10 years.   This will match the contribution by the exportingauthority which is required under the Housing and Town Development(Scotland) .&apos;.ct 195?.(c) S^fcisd  SMS(i)   Some authorities which are remote from   centres  of supply ofbuilding labour end materials qualify for additional subsidyunder existing legislation.   This is of particular value to the highlands and Islands. The subsidy will continue with adjustments to take account of the assistance towards higher co ts which willbe given through the basic subsidy,(ii)   For authorities whose existing commitments for housing necessarilycreate an exceptional financial burden, the new rates of subsidywill he specially supplemented.(iii)    The Bill will also enable additional subsidy to he paid to localauthorities who provide housing accommodation urgently requiredto meet the needs of incoming worker,&apos;,, where it cannot be providedwithout imposing a heavy financial burden on the local authority.6.     Hojtjels^jrant.    The maximum grant pa; able under Section 89 of theHousing (Scotland) xict 1950 will be increased from  7 to  15 a bedroom.(ii)
