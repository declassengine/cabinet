IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(65) 16430th November, 1965COPY NO.66;abinetTHE ADULT OFFENDER:  DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome department i ask the agreement of my colleagues that I should present forth-with a White Paper setting out in general terms my proposals for penalreform for the adult offender.    I had hoped to secure a place in themain programme for this Session for a Criminal Justice Bill which wouldincorporate these proposals;  but it has been found necessary to relegatethis Bill to the reserve and it may not be possible to introduce it this session.    In any event it has a low priority for drafting purposes andtherefore cannot be ready until some time next year.    If my colleagues agree I would provoke an inspired question asking what my proposals were for penal reform and would answer it by saying that it is shortlyintended to lay a White Paper before Parliament.2.       My purpose is to place before the public a White Paper whichwill be, as it were, a twin to the White Paper on the Young Offenderpublished on 25th August.     Together they would, I believe, disclose animpressive pattern of penal reform covering the under 16&apos;s, the 16 to21&apos;s and the adult offender, and, as it were, first and second instal-ments of our measures to implement the thinking in the LongfordReport.    A great deal of work and thought has been devoted to this inmy Department and now that a year has gone by and public opinion is considerably interested in an exercised about conditions in prisons, i feel that the Government will be under criticism if no response is madeto the challenge for reform presented by existing prison conditions.3,       My main proposals were approved by the Home AffairsCommittee earlier this year.     The Committee has approved my proposal to publish a White Paper, and the draft annexed to thismemorandum incorporates some amendments arising from theCommittee&apos;s discussion of an earlier draft.4.       The central feature of my proposals is to select by a carefulprocess all those prisoners who are capable of being reclaimed forsociety and bringing them back into society under a considerablyextended parole system which would apply, not merely to ordinary andstar prisoners, but also to the recidivist prisoners as well.    EveryGovernor I have consulted has emphasised that if he could hold out to prisoners in his charge the hope of an earlier release on parole, subjectto licence, it would very greatly strengthen his hand in influencing themtowards improved behaviour and in conducting his prison.    It wouldalso, in the view of prison governors, lead to a large number ofprisoners abandoning a life of crime on their release under licence and-1-CQNFSDENT8AL

Piome Offic e, S. W. 1.30th November, 1965-2-CONFIDENTJALIGreturning permanently to society as useful citizens.    An example of thevalue of supervision is the fact that of 1,100 prisoners released in 1962who were supervised by the Central After-Care Association from 83. 8(Dartmoor) to 98.1 per cent (Wormwood Scrubs) had not returned to prison by the end of 1964, a period of from two to three years.5.       I propose also to abolish the existing systems of correctivetraining and preventive detention.    In the draft White Paper I also give an account of the progress of the building programme and deal withother matters which I mink of great importance, such as keepingprisoners in touch with their families.6.       I am anxious to publish these proposals very soon in the formof a White Paper because I think it would be most undesirable to haveto remain, as it were, mute on the subject of penal reform for adultprisoners until certainly next year and perhaps even the year after, ifit is impossible to fit the Criminal Justice Bill into the programme.7.       I accordingly ask for the agreement of my colleagues to mypublishing the White Paper as in the annex attached.F. S.

annex the ADULT OFFENDER &quot;        i fl &apos;7Introduction&quot;You cannot train men for freedom in conditions of captivity&quot;.In these words the late Sir Alexander Paterson stated the paradoxwhich presents itself daily to every prison administration.     Theparadox cannot he evaded;    hut it is all the more necessary to seek to overcome it hy strengthening links between the prisoner and thefree community and hy developing new ways to ease the transitionhack to freedom.      In August the Government laid before parliamentary White Paper headed &apos;The Young Offender&apos;.      The present white paper is twin to that Paper and together they set out theGovernments broad proposals for early reform in our treatment of offenders in England and Wales.     Like the August White Paper, thepresent White Paper is published for purposes of discussion.     the august White Paper outlines our approach to the under 16s, and the16s to 21s.     The present White Paper deals with the adult offenderover 21 who has been sentenced to imprisonment.2,     The first need is to protect society against the dangerous manor woman who by crime will disturb its peace if at large.      The idea that anybody is incurably wicked is distasteful and hard to accept.But experience shows there are some who just will not make friendswith society ever.     Against them society must be protected, notrevenged.     It does none of us any good to enjoy a sense of revenge.Such evil-doers must be kept apart, for long periods;    even,  should it be unavoidable, for life.     But to prevent the progressivedeterioration which often results from long confinement in prioon,even in the case of the strongest-minded,  their conditions inconfinement must be humane and tolerable.3.     Such irreconcilabi.es are the exception not the rule.     The restdiffer infinitely.     Many are disturbed unstable and immature.     F^germany, it is difficult to acclimatise themselves to the idea of beingever fully re-accepted into society, knowing that they have donethings for which their fellow citizens will always dislike themmistrust them and be reluctant to forgive them.     Long peiiods in prison may punish, or possibly deter them, but do them no good -certainly do not fit them for re-entry into society.     Everyadditional year of prison progressively unfits them.Release on Licenceh,     The central feature of the Governments proposals is that prisoners whose character and record render them suitable for thispurpose should be released from prison earlier than they are atpresent.     Prisoners who do not of necessity have to be detained forthe protectior of the public are in some cases more likely to be made into decent citizens if, before completing the whole of theirsentence they are released under supervision, with a liability to recall if they do not behave.     Other countries teve used systems ofthis kind with success and the Government have concluded that thetime has come to ask for powers to adopt a system of early releaseon licence in this country.5.     At present a prisoner is released after completing two-thirds of his sentence unless he misconducts himself in prison.     What isproposed is that a prisoner5 s date of iielease should be largely dependent upon his response to training and his likely behaviour onreleaseo     A considerable number of long-term prisoners reach arecognisable peak in their training at which they may respond togenerous treatment, but after which, if kept in prison, they may godownhill,,     To give such prisoners the opportunity of supervisedfreedom at the right moment may be decisive in securing their returnto decent citizenship,

6.       It is therefore proposed that the Home Secretary should beempowered to release on licence any prisoner who has served at least one-third of his sentence or 12; months, whichever is the longer.Release on licence would be limited to those who were likely to respond to generous treatment and who were not regarded as a risk to the public.     The licence would run until the date on which the prisoner would otherwise have been released;    that is to say, in a normal case, the date on which having earned his one-third good conduct remission, he would have been released.7.     Release would be subject to conditions which might, accordingto the individual case, be more or less strict.     A normal conditionwould be supervision by a probation officer, and conditions as toresidence would also, in suitable cases, be imposed.     Failure tocomply with the terms of the licence might involve recall to prison.8.     These proposals can be illustrated by taking, as an example, anoffender serving an ordinary sentence of say six years&apos; imprisonment.He would under the existing arrangements be entitled, if he behavedwell in prison, to the ordinary good conduct remission of one-thirdof his sentence, that is, two years.     The proposal is that inaddition, if he is a prisoner who has shown promise or determination to reform he should be able to earn a further period of freedom onparole of up to one-third of his sentence.     In the example quoted,the offender could thus be released after serving two years of hissentence in prison.     Thus his first two years would be spent in prison.     For the next two he would be free but on licence undersupervision.     For the remaining two years he would be at liberty,and no longer liable to recall.     These arrangements would afford the strongest incentive to reform, and greatly assist the task ofprison administration.     It would ameliorate the present conditions under which prisoners serving long terms of imprisonment becameprogressively less able to re-enter society.     It would incidentallyalso gc some way to relieve the existing overcrowding in prisons.The persistent offender9.     There are at present two forms wf special sentence which may be imposed on persistent offenders - corrective training and preventivedetention.     The former is for the younger man, usually in histwenties, and the latter for the older criminal.10.   Corrective training was introduced by che Criminal Justice Act,1948.     Courts are empowered to pass a sentence of between two and four years&apos; corrective training on an offender of 21 or more whoseoffence and record show that he needs &quot;training of a correctivecharacter with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime&quot;.This provision is generally agreed to be now inappropriate.     Todayall suitable prisoners, whatever their sentence, are given training.The number of sentences of corrective training has fallen steadily toabout 200 a year.     There are at present only some 260 men and womenserving such sentences.11,   It is proposed that the special sentence of corrective training should be abolished.12,   Preventive detention In its present form was also introduced by the 1948 Act.     It is available for those aged 30 and over (inpractice for those over 40) who have a substantial criminal record.A sentence of preventive detention may be imposed when the court is satisfied that it is expedient for the protection of the public.The term of the sentence;must be not less than five and not more than14 years;    in practice the minimum sentence is one of seven years.Preventive detention sentences, too, have decreased in number.     In1964 there were 40 such sentences, and there are only about 500preventive detainees in prison at the present, time..

i u- -j13.    The public have a right to be protected from offenders whopersistently commit serious offences, and the courts must have adequate powers to deal with them.     The Government is convincedhowever that the special sentence of preventive detention is nolonger appropriate.     It is proposed, therefore, to abolishpreventive detention.1h.    Instead Courts will be given jurisdiction when they have beforethem a person who has committed an offence and who is in additionshown by evidence to be a persistent offender to impose a longersentence than they would have imposed had they been sentencing himonly for the crime itself of which he is convicted.     For thispurpose we propose to empower the Courts to sentence a persistentoffender to up to 10 years&apos; imprisonment where the ordinary maximumterm for the offence is five years or more and not more than 10 years;and to up to five years&apos; imprisonment where the ordinary maximum termis two years or more and not more than five years.     Where theordinary maximum terra exceeds 10 years, there will be no greatermaximum for the persistent offender.16.   But it is essential for this purpose that the persistentoffender must be clearly defined in a definition in the statutein such a way as to apply only to delinquents whose character andrecord of offences are such as to put it beyond all doubt that theyare a real menace to society, and to exclude the petty criminal whocommits a series of lesser offences.     He is certainly a nuisance butnot the menace against whom special protection is necessary.     To bea persistent offender, the convicted person must(a) be sentenced by a superior Court for an offence whichis punishable with two years imprisonment or more andwas committed within three years of a previous convic-tion or completion of a custodial sentence, for an offence similarly punishable;    and(b) have been convicted on indictment on at least threeprevious occasions since reaching the age of 21 of offences punishable on indictment with imprisonment for two years or more, and have been on at least twoof those occasions given a custodial sentence;    and(c) have been sentenced on those occasions to imprison-ment for periods aggregating not less than fiveyears,17.    In such a case the arrangements for release on licence described above would apply with one important modification.     As with theordinary prisoner, the man sentenced as a persistent offender wouldbe eligible for release after one-third of his sentence but, what-ever the date of release, he would be cn licence until the whole ofhis sentence expired.     This would ensure that the persistentoffender was subject to control, in custody or on licence, for thewhole of the period considered necessary by the court for theprotection of the public.18.   The position of a persistent offender under these proposals maybe illustrated by the following example.     Let it be assumed that hehad committed the same offence as the offender in the example inparagraph 8 but the Court, instead of the sentence of six years which might have been thought appropriate to that offence, had decided, after it had been proved that he was a persistent offender,and on consideration of the circumstances of the offender and the offence, to impose a sentence of - say - nine years.     He too would,although a persistent offender, qualify both for the one-third good conduct remission and for the one-third parole on licence.     Thus,if he behaved, himself well in prison and showed signs of beinglikely to reform if given a chance, he might be released at the3

1 -! ftii i;earliest after three years.     In order to remain at liberty,however, he would have to behave during the whole of the remainingsix years.     If he misbehaved at any time during this six years hewould be liable to recall to prison to serve the remainder of the nine years of his sentence.     Any persistent offender who had itin him to try to make good would thus be afforded the strongestinducement to behave and a safe-guard would be provided forsociety.The treatment of long-term prisoners19.   Whilst every effort would be made to reclaim for society the prisoner capable of reform it still remains the primaryconsideration that society must be properly protected against thewrongdoer.     Unhappily this does involve that some prisoners willhave to undergo confinement for very long periods.     Indeed, somereally dangerous prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment, who can never be safely allowed back into society, may have to be confinedfor the rest of their natural lives,.     The Government proposes that in order to prevent a deterioration which otherwise might set in in the case of such prisoners after many years confinement,conditions specially humane and tolerable should be provided forthem.     A special block at Albany in the Isle of Wight for theirdetention is being planned.     It will have maximum security arrangements but every reasonable endeavour will be made to makethe lives of prisoners detained in it sufficiently varied, andto give such prisoners sufficient interests, as to make it possible for them to spend in it a large part cf their lifewithout grave deterioration.     This problem will arise par&quot;&apos; icularlyin the case of murderers sentenced to life-imprisonment whosecharacter is such that they cannot be released either at all or until after the expiry of a very great number of years.Allocation20,    In recent years there has been progress in the developmentwithin the prison system of a comprehensive range of establish-ments and regimes suited to the needs of different types ofprisoner.     It is intended to make further advances in thisdirection to enable the prison administration, when a man has beengiven a custodial sentence, to assess his requirements and send him for training to the type of establishment from which he is most likely to qualify for consideration for release on licence.21.    In particular the treatment of the small time persistentoffender will take account of the needs of those of inadequatepersonality (as most of them are).     Pull use will be made, bothin the custodial part of the sentence and during the period onlicence, of such special institutions, homes and hostels as are appropriate.Visits to -prisoners22.    It i3 of the utmost importance to maintain contact betweenthe prisoner and his family.     This is essential not only for thepurposes of retaining contacts with society but to make it possible to bring him back into society as a useful citizen.     Aman who has won the trust and affection of a wife and childrenmust have good in him.     His bond with his family is the bridgeover which he can pass back from prison to the companionship ofhis fellow citizens.     It must not be undermined.     Moreover sucha man also suffers a far more agonising punishment confined in prison away from his family than the rootless introvert who has never thought of anybody but himself.h

230   Under the existing system a prisoner may be far removed fromhis wife and family and from other home ties and may only see his family on rare occasions.     He may, as it were, save up accumulatedvisits and then be sent back to his local prison in order to receivefrequent visits from his family during a short period of time.     Atpresent such accumulated visiting periods are only allowed when a prisoner has served at least two years.     It is proposed forthwith to reduce this qualifying period to one year.     In addition visits to the prisoner by his family should be facilitated.     A.dvance onthese lines must of necessity be cautious and gradual in order not onlyto overcome the formidable admin:strative difficulties involved butalso to avoid abuse of facilities granted.     In the long termhowever it is hoped that extended opportunities might be given to prisoners who show themselves worthy of trust to have from time totime as may seem appropriate day or week-end home leave in order to preserve the family bond.Work for prisoners2k,   The policy followed in providing work for prisoners is based onthe three reports of the Advisory Council on the Employment ofPrisoners.     Many of the recommendations of these reports have beenor are being carried out, but much remains to be done.     TheGovernment&apos;s aim is to provide every prisoner with the cost type ofwork of which he is capable and the best industrial training forwhicn he is fitted.     An industrial expert has been appointed with responsibility for creating a really efficient prison industrial organisation,-     A high standard of industrial efficiency is not onlyin the interest of both prisoners and the community:    it is thenecessary basis for improving the payments made to prisoners fortheir v/ork.     Particular attention is being given to the possibilityof such improvements.     An- eventual solution may--be a system under whichprisoners receive normal wages, out of whicn they contribute totheir own support and that of their families, and. perhaps also tothe cost of compensating their victims.25.   Every endeavour will be made to increase the existingaccommodation in hostels.     At the moment for the prison populationof 23,000 there are available only some 250 hostel places.     Thismeans that it is impossible to hold out any hope of going to ahostel for a prisoner serving less than four years and that a great many who would benefit by being in a hostel have little chance ofbeing given this opportunity.     Prisoners in hostels li^e within the prison precincts but go out to v/ork daily unsupervised during thelast six months of their sentence in order to ease the transitionbetween confinement and free life in society.     Since it must take time, with the maximum effort in expanding accommodation andrecruiting prison staff, to increase to a marked degree the scale ofhostel accommodation an experiment is being made in allowingprisoners not in hostel accommodation, but under confinement inordinary prison conditions, to go out during the day to do work,unsupervised, with local employers.     The success of such a schemedepends upon the careful selection of suitable prisoners and it is greatly hoped that it will be possible substantially to increase thenumber of prisoners who in this way are allowed to work unsupervisedduring the day-time returning in the evening to prison.Sh91lt--ferm imprisonment for drunkenness26.    Special efforts are being made to help prisoners who arealcoholics.     There are already branches of Alcoholics Anonymous ina number of prisons, and special units for the treatment ofaalcoholismhave been set up at Y/andsworth, Pentonville, Wormwood Scrubs,Y7akefield and Hollowayl      It is hoped to set up others.27.    These arrangements cannot, however, do much for the 5?000prisoners sentenced annually for periods of one, two or four weeksfor offences of drunkenness,.     These prisoners occupy much needed

cell and workshop space in the crowded local prisons and it is not easy to give them any constructive treatment.      It has accordingly been decided to use, as an experiment, the open prison at Spring Hillin Buckinghamshire to house men who have hitherto served short-termsentences for drunkenness in Pentenville or Wandsworth Prisons.    Thepsychiatric prison at Grendon is adjacent, and its medical and other resources will he available for any of the new inmates of Spring Hillwh-- may need them.    It is. hoped to identify those who need treatment,and try to arrange for xt in outside hospitals after the men&apos;srelease.     Pull liaison will be maintained with social workers out-side the prison in order to make suitable after-care arrangements.28.    If these arrangements prove successful, consideration will begiven to their extension to ether prisons serving heavily-populatedurban areas.Prison building programme29.   Prisons for men are still seriously overcrowded - about 5,000inmates sleep two or three to a cell intended for only one prisoner.The need for more accommodation is therefore still urgent.    Moreover,many of the older prisons are unsuitable for modern methods of penaltreatment, and the proposals in this White Paper will accentuate theneed for varied establishments for their successful operation.30,    The present extensive programme for new construction and re-development includes the building of new prisons at Gartree,Leicestershire;    Albany, Isle of Wight;    Coldingley, Surrey;Honeybourne, Worcestershire;    Low Newton, Durham;    Culham,Oxfordshire;    and some new constuction at existing establishments.In addition, accommodation is being planned for up to 100prisoners serving long sentences in the special block to be built at Albany, Isle -cf Wight, which has already been described.     other projects are being considered.31.   A new prison for about 250 women is being &apos;planned at TheydonMount, near Epping, Essex,32.   Because of the need for further research into the design ofprison accommodation, the Minister cf Public Building and Works, inconsultation with the Home Secretary, reconstituted in 196h thedevelopment group for prison building,,     Its first task was to study the type of prison development best suited to the needs of the future,having regard to changes in methods cf penal treatment and in building techniques.     The group has made a preliminary survey of the many factors affecting design, such as the needs of security,  thedevelopment of modern methods of training and treatment, and thenecessity for better living accommodation and facilities, includingimproved night sanitation;    and is now considering the design of anew security prison, which it is planned to build at Pull Sutton inthe East Fading of Yorkshire,After-care33.    It is generally agreed that if prisoners are to make success-fully the difficult transition from prison to a free life in thecommunity they need the support of an effective system of after-care.     The developments outlined in this paper emphasise that need.6

A. A t33h.,    In 1963 the Advisory Council on the Treatment of Offendersrecommended a new approach to after-care, including the installa-tion of social workers in all prisons and the assumption ofresponsibility for all after-care on discharge by a new andenlarged probation and after-care service, supported by voluntaryeffort.     The Advisory Council envisaged a corps of prison welfare officers who would be members of the prison staff, though possessingthe same qualities and skills as probation officers and inter-changeable with them.     The Government have taken the view that thesurest way of achieving the Council&apos;s aim is to integrate the prisonwelfare service with the probation and after-care service.     Thisproposal has received general approval, and in future all PrisonWelfare Officers will be Probation Officers on secondment.3.5*   For just over a yeax* the transfer of the Local Aid Societies&apos;responsibility for after-care has been proceeding smoothly.     Ofthe 36 local Discharged Prisoners&apos; Aid Societies in existence atthe time of the publication of the Advisory Council&apos;s report, 28have now handed over their after-care responsibilities to some 60probation committees and it is expected that the transfer will bevery nearly complete by April i3&amp;6a36.    The termination of the after-care responsibilities of the localAid Societies has brought no decline in voluntary effort,     In many parts of the country there is new and most welcome interest indischarged prisoners.     The success of after-care depends in great measure on the acceptance cf the offender and his family by thecommunity,,     Voluntary workers can do much to help the public torealise their responsibilities in this field.37.   A Working Party has been set up, under the Chairmanship of theDowager Marchioness cf Reading, &quot;Tw consider what contributionVoluntary effort could make to the after-care of discharged offendersand to advise the Secretary of State what particular projects shouldbe considered for assistance from public funds.:!     One interimreport is already being studied.      Simultaneously the national association of Discharged Prisoners&apos; Aid Societies and &quot;ither bcdiesinterested in this work have been considering how best voluntaryeffort can be integrated into a nation-wide pattern, and expanded to meet the most urgent needs of the discharged offender.38o   A particularly valuable development in recent years has beenthe establishment of homes where discharged prisoners can stay ina friendly atmosphere free of institutiraalism until they are ready-to fend for themselves.     A scheme of Government contributions towards the running costs of these &quot;half-way houses&quot; has recentlybeen announced.39-   There are many other voluntary activities, which range from thebefriending of individuals and providing material help - includingnotably help for the wives and families of those still in prison -to the running of clubs where ex-prisoners are welcome, and a housing scheme to help them find a home.AO.   Sor?.e offenders are so handicapped, mentally or physically,that the chances of their successful establishment in society are necessarily small.     They will need continuous and intensive support for a very long time, and there is room for further voluntaryeffort here      The personality of some is so eroded by long yearsof imprisonment that it may well prove desirable to promote the

provision   ef hostels, possibly with a sheltered workshop, which for the rest of their lives will give them the same sense of security that they have experienced in prison.     If theseunfortunates can be contained in this wr.y it will be better thansending them back to prison and their potential victims (oftenthose who are most vulnerable to petty thieving and to whom anydepredation at all is a major tragedy) will benefit.CONCLUSIONh/l.   At the present time a great deal of thought is being givento the treatment of the prisoner.     Many experiments are beingcarried out, and their results carefully assessed.     The proposals in this White Paper represent an attempt, on the basis of presentknowledge, to strengthen the constructive forces in our penalsystem, and to tackle afresh the problem of the persistentoffender.      They seek, first,  to improve the powers available tothe courts and, secondly, to strengthen the means of implementingRule 1 of the Prison Rules of 196h:    &quot;The purpose of the training and treatment of convicted prisoners shall be to encourage and assist them to lead a good and useful life.&quot;e
