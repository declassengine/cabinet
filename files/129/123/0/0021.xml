4 K9X W W$DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(65) 1716th December, 1965COPY NO. 6 6CABINETLONDON TRANSPORTMemorandum by the Minister of TransportSince the papers by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster and myself (C.(65) 168 and E.D. (T)(65) 39) were prepared, there has   -been a new development.    I am now faced with a debate on the Reporton the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries (London Transport)on Thursday next, 9th December.2.       As my colleagues know, I am committed to a statement on london Transports affairs before the Recess.    In the circumstances,I think I must make some statement during the debate about theGovernment&apos;s policy towards London Transport and what should be done about fares in the New Year.3.       There arc two possible alternative statements.     One would be inthe form of a &quot;package deal&quot; announcing all that we can straight away,including the necessity of raising London Transports fares early nextyear.     The other would have much less to say;  would shelve the issueof fares for, say, six months;   and would promise a further statement at that time.4.       I very much prefer the former approach, because:(a)    Parliament - and the public - expect us to announce firmt I propose to say will be unwelcome to many -meaures now.motorists and users of public transport alike.    But it at least showsthat as a Government we are dealing with the whole problem, not patchingand piecing together bits of it.(b)    V/e have a good case to put.    It is set out broadly in paragraph 12of the Chancellor of the Duchy&apos;s paper.    (I would only dissent - at thisstage - from the reference to the possibility of a takeover by the greater london Council).    Paragraph 12(3)(b) - the fares point - is as important as any other, and in my view ought to be made.(c)    It is unlikely that we shall in fact be able to produce in six monthsa statement about solutions to traffic conditions and the right balance between public and private transport that will sound much moreimpressive than v/hat we could say now.    Certainly v/e should by then have a clearer idea of what is practicable e.nd. when it can begin to take effect;  but v/e will not be able to show any solid results, or even to promise that they are only just round the corner.    If what we say thencan only be in much the same terms e.s what we can say now there iseverything to gain by an announcement at once,,

(d)    To delay the fares increase v/ill merely make the situation weeventually have to deal with worse than it need be.5.       i have placed at Annexes A and B drafts of two alternativestatements.    i strongly recommend statement A, and seek the agreementof my colleagues to my making a statement on these lines during thecourse of any early intervention in the debate.Ministry of Transport, G. E. 1.6th December, 1965

DRAFT STATEMENT AAs the House know;s, the Government have been making a comprehensivestudy, in conjunction with the London Transport Board, of the circumstances in which the Board operate.     This study has ranged beyond London Transport&apos;financial affairs:   the days are past when we could deal piecemeal with theroad, the rail, the public transport or traffic problems of a city likeLondon.     We have looked at them all as a whole.   Long-term policies need further investigations, notably those still being carried out within theLondon Transportation Study,     But the Government are now ready to state their immediate intentions.As a result of our analysis of the situation we adopt the followingbroad objectives:First, to call a halt to the deterioration of London&apos;s transport facilities - of all kinds - and to make the positive improvementsnecessary to meet the economic and social needs of a great city,and to ensure that the traffic viral to those needs shall havefreedom to move,SoocnxL, to take measures to ensure the best use of scarce road space.Third, since we regard public transport systems as essential, toensure that necessary public transport services are not only maintainedbut improved.fourth, to find means to achieve a more equitable distribution of theburden of paying for London&apos;s transport in all its forms.To achieve these objectives, complementary measures &quot;will be needed, onthe one hand to discourage the use of private cars, notably at peak times,and on the other to improve public transport.To discourage the use of private cars, the G-orernment have decided thatthe most immediate and effective measure   is a now policy towards parkingin Central London.     Parking restrictions must be used as a deliberatedeterrent to the peak hour car commuter, not merely - as in the past - asa means of keeping clear the road space needed for moving traffic.     Thenow policy must bite on both on- and off-street parking.     I am openingdiscussions at once with the Greater London Council and local authorities concerned to decide how the new policy can most quickly and effectively begiven effect.-1-

Other possible measures of restriction are being considered in detail,including extra charges for the use of vehicles in Central or othercongested areas of London;   /arid a tax on employment, possibly linked tohours of work/7.     Precise methods of restriction are being considered indetail with the G-greater London Council and others concerned.     What canbe stated now is the Governments determination to achieve a marked improvement in a situation which, without special measures, will manifestlyget worse.Some of the measures concerned might, if thejr are to be implemented in the most effective way, involve legislation.     /JThe Government arc also considering -whether changes in the present tax arrangements for the provision and use of cars by business users could contribute towards alleviatingtraffic problems in large cities, notably London^On the public transport side, we need better, quicker, more comfortableand more punctual services.     The easing of peak-hour road traffic should go a long way towards achieving shorter-term improvements by helping to clear the roads;   by encouraging people back to public transport;   and by enabling transport providers to reshape their services in the light ofchanged conditions.     Moreover, measures of restraint can be so arranged as to ensure that, directly or indirectly, those who contribute tocongestion in London will contribute to maintaining and developing thepublic transport services,In the longer term, public transport will have to be improved in more radical ways;   through new investment and by intensifying the effortdevoted to research and development so as to achieve increased productivity and other far-reaching improvements in techniques.Meanwhile, it will still be necessary, as the costs- particularly wagocosts - of providing public transport rise more steeply than can be matched by increased productivity to accept some increases in fares to help bridge the gap.     Further deterioration in the financial position of the london transport Board would make the eventual problems more difficult to solve.I have therefore told the Chairman of the Board that the Government do not propose to ask for any further deferment of the fare increase originally intended to take effect earlier in the year.Notwithstanding this increase in fares it is likely that the london transport Board will require some measure of financial assistance in 1966and in due course the Government will present to the House their proposalsfor providing this.-2-CONFIDENTIAL

While it remains to be seen how far the measures proposed will help to mend London Transport&apos;s finances, they will, halt the decline, and set the London Transport Board in particular, on the way towards a situationwhere, in the -words of the Select Committee, they can provide &quot;an efficieneconomic and adequate service of public transport throughout their Area,for which tne travelling public would be -willing to pay&quot;.-3-CONFIDENTIAL

ANNEX draft STATEMENT BAs the House knows, the Government have heen making a comprehensivestudy, in conjunction with the London Transport Board, of the circumstances in which the Board operate.     This study has ranged beyond London Transportsfinancial affairs;   the days are past when we could deal piecemeal with theroad, the rail, the public transport or traffic problems of a city likeLondon.    We have looked at them all as a whole.Further investigations are still necessary.     Longer-term policies, inparticular, will depend on work at present being carried out within theLondon Transportation Study.     But the Government, having assessed the shorter-term London Transport situation in relation to the deterioration of public transport and to increasing traffic congestion, are now ableto state the broad lines of their approach to the problem.The Governments broad objectives for London&apos;s transport are:First, to call a ha.lt to the deterioration of London&apos;s transport facilities - of all kinds - and to make tne positive improvementsnecessary to meet the economic and social needs of a great city,and to ensure that the traffic vital to those needs shall havefreedom to move.Second, to take measures to ensure the best use of road space.Third, since we regard efficient public transpoit systems as essential,to ensure that necessary public transport services are not onlymaintained but improved.Fourth, to find means to achieve more equitable distribution ofthe burden of paying for London&apos;s transport in all its forms0To achieve those objectives, complementary measures will be needed,on the one hand to discourage the use of private cars, notably at peaktimes, and on the other to improve public transport.Possible methods of further restricting private cars are being examined by my Department in conjunction with the Home Office, the Police,the Greater London Council and others concerned.     Their work relates to the county as a whole, but with special interest in London.     I expectdetailed conclusions early in the New Year-.     It will then be possible towork out and propose specific schemes.    The most likely possibilities at themoment would seem to be further controls on parking in central or congestedareas of London;   extra charges for the use of vehicles in such areas;   andfiscal measures   possibly by means of a tax on employment linked to hoursof workj70-4-

Meanwhile, I must state the Government1s determination to achieve a marked improvement in a situation which, without special measures, willmanifestly get worse.On the public transport side, we need better, quicker and morecomfortable and more punctual services.     The easing of peak-hour road traffic should go a long way towards achieving shorter-term improvementsby helping to clear the roads;   by encouraging people back to public transport;     and by enabling transport providers to reshape their services in the light of changed conditions.     In the longer term, public transport will have to be improved in more radical ways;   through new investment andby intensifying the effort devoted to research and development so as to achieve increased productivity and other far-reaching improvements intechniques.Yftiatever is done to discourage private cars in Central London andto improve public transport, it will still be necessary to accept increases in fares to meet increases in costs - particularly wage costs.     But afare increase in London now would still fall short of restoring thebalance of the London Transport Board1s finances, and outside financialassistance would still be necessary.     I have therefore asked the Chairmanof the Board to accept a further deferment ^or about six months/ of thefare increases originally proposed to come into effect earlier in theyear.     By the end of that time I hope to be able to announce the measureswe sho.ll be talcing to restrain private car commuting and to restore thebalance between public and private transport.In due course I shall also present to the House the Government&apos;sproposals for providing the London Transport Board -with the financialassistance they will require in 1966.-5-
