CONFIDENTIAL &quot;        2S3DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)0.(65) 130 COPY NO. g g14th December, 1965CABINETSPACE POLICY review memorandum by the Minister of aviation at their meeting on Tuesday, 14th December, 1965, the ministerial Committee on Joint Research and Development considered the space Policy Review, a copy of which is attached.    The Committeeconcluded that the United Kingdom should seek to terminate its comrnit-ment to the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO).However, as we v/ere committed to membership and to payment of oursubscription until March, 1966, and, in addition, to a consideration ofthe new ELDO Programme in March, 1966, we should not announce our intention of disengaging from the Organisation when the ELDO Councilmet on 20th December, 1965.    It was agreed that it might be best if wecould persuade our ELDO partners to undertake what might be called a european Space Review, on the lines of the Review we had recentlycompleted ourselves.    This Review shotild be carried out as a matter of urgency and might cover not merely the activities of ELDO, but also thoseof the European Space Research Organisation (esro) and the EuropeanConference on Satellite Communications (GETS).    It was to be hoped thatone of the conclusions of such a Review would be the abandonment of the eldo A and B programmes.2.       The majority of the Committee were in favour of proceeding withthe BLACK ARROW programme, but the Chief Secretary, Treasury,reserved his position.    It was felt, however, that to withdraw from ELDOand at the same time to proceed with BLACK ARROW as a purely nationallauncher project would create the worst possible impression in europe and would also run counter to the general approach to aero-space questionsrecommended by the Plowden Committee.    It was therefore agreed that  /e should, in the context of the proposed European Space Review, examinethe possibility of offering BLACK ARRO&quot;W as a co-operative venturebetween ourselves and any of our ELDO partners who might wish toparticipate.3,       It is therefore recommended by the Joint Research and development committee that -(i) we should work towards terminating our commitment to ELDO;(ii) this should be done in the manner best calculated to minimise the political damage of withdrawal;(iii) we should proceed with the BLACK ARROW programme;(iv) we should examine the possibility of inviting any of our ELDOpartners, who might wish to do so, to participate in the black ARR.OW programme.R.

CONFIDENTIAL -       9HiSPACE POLICY REVTE17Intro duetion1.     The purpose of this paper is to summarise for Ministers the relevantissues relating to civil policy in space including developments since thereport of the Space Policy Review Committee (circulated as MISC. 3&quot;lA:8th January, 1965), and to submit those which call for decision in the nearfuture.     The only military interest in space which is referred to in this paper concerns military satellite communications.     Other military interests are being considered separately and are covered at length in the report ofthe Bondi Sub-Committee of the Defence Research Committee (D.R.C.) on united Kingdom Defence Interests in Space.     Note should also be taken ofthe report of the Task Croup on Public Expenditure circulated on11th January, 1965 as MISC. 31/2.Present Activities2,     Our present activities in space can be considered under four headings:(a)   Scientific Space Research:    (b)   The European Launcher development organisation;   (c)   the United Kingdom Technological Space Programme, and(d)   Satellite Communications.     More detailed accounts of each field of activity are given in the Annexes.(a) Scientific Space Research (Annex A)3. Our current activities, which are the responsibility of the science research Council under the general control of the Secretary of State for education and Science, fall into two main categories -(i)   the United Kingdom national space research programme including theAnglo-United States co-operative programme;(ii)   the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO) programme.The cost to us of these two items in 1965/66 is approximately  3 million andis expected to rise to a ceiling of rather more than  6 million per annum by1963/69.     In the rest of this report we do not further consider this worksave to the extent that it has implications for the rest (e.g. seeparagraph 6 below).(b) The European Launcher Development Organisation ^Annex4.     This organisation was set up in 1962 at the instigation of theUnited Kingdom to enable European countries, anxious to participate in spaceactivities but unable to afford the cost of developing launchers nationally,to participate together in a technical programme for the production of an initial launcher (ELDO A) for which the United Kingdom would supply the-1-CONFIDENTIAL

Australia became a member and madeavailable the Woomera range and supporting facilities.     The programme was originally estimated to cost  70 million (1963-69), of which theUnited Kingdom share was 38.8 per cent ( 27.3 million), but the estimatehas now risen to  150 million (of which our share is  58.2 million) and,in the absence of a completely costed plan for the remaining 3i&quot; years,there are now indications that even this amount will be exceeded.     TheUnited Kingdom&apos;s annual contribution in 1965-66 is of the order of 13 million, and up to the end of 1965 v/e Trill have contributed a total of 29.6 million (leaving  28.6 million outstanding),5. ^ In April this year an inter-governmental conference accepted thereconnendations of a working group that, if ELDO were to continue inexistence, a now programme for &quot;.n advanced launcher (ELDO B) was the most desirable objective.     To reach this, it was considered on technical grounds(France re-serving her position) that the present ELDO A programme should becompleted and, together with the development of an apogee motor (ELDO A/S),would be the best foundation for ELDO B.     Before this conference ministers agreed that United Kingdom policy should be to accept in principle that the eldo programme should continue on lines directed to the development of anELDO B launcher, on the understanding that we should not enter into any commitment as regards either the total expenditure to be incurred inrelation to the project or our own share of it, (C.C.(65) 23rd Conclusions,Minute 3).     Pending the preparation of detailed costings no EuropeanGovernment has committed itself to any expenditure on the ELDO B project,other than for limited project studies.6,     The present provisional estimate for this new ELDO programme is 110 million ( 25 million for ELDO A/S and  85 million for ELDO B), but,although a suitable contingency allowance has been made, there is thepossibility that the final sum may be higher.     On the basis of our presentshare (38.8 per cent) this would involve us in an expenditure of  42.7 million;   but we shall try to reduce our share to 25 per cent ( 27.5 million)in the new negotiations in March 1966.     This means that together with the outstanding balance of the ELDO A development ( 28.6 million;   paragraph A)and a presumed share of an equatorial launching base ( 2.5 million of thetotal costs;   see paragraph 7) and certain support costs ( 2.5 million) our commitments to the ELDO programme for the seven years up to 1972 will thusrange from  61.1 million to  76.3 million, an average of  8.7-10.9 million per year,-2-

7.     On present forecasts, there is a market for only two ELDO launchers,those for the proposed ESRO large astronomical satellites (see Annex A,paragraph A) and only then if they are competitive in price with suitableUnited States launchers.     It seems possible that the need for a productionsubsidy cannot be entirely excluded.     If the ELDO A launcher were to beused for this purpose an equatorial launching base will be required, apossible location for which would be French Guiana, which on Frenchestimates, will cost between  7.0 million and  10 million to construct (this estimate is undoubtedly too low even for a launching pad;   if a whole baseis required it would probably cost not less than  25 million).     In addition is estimated that the base will cost  1.8 million a year to run.    no agreement has yet been reached as to how this cost should be shared, whichis additional to the  150 million for the completion of ELDO A.     Otherpotential uses for ELDO launchers are for the proving of communicationssatellites by ourselves or by the European Conference on SatelliteCommunication (CETS);   (see paragraph 13 and Annex E) but no   firm agreements have been made, and here again the launchers would have to be competitivewith United States counterparts.(c)   The United Kingdom Technological Space Programme (Annex C^8.     The main items of this programme relate to research on basic satellitetechnology, both extra-mural and intra-mural, and to a proposal by theMinistry of Aviation to develop a small satellite launcher (SSL) based onthe BLACK KNIGHT ballistic test vehicle.9.     The Ministry of Aviation base their case for the development of a smallsatellite launcher (BLACK ARROW) on the grounds that it would be primarilya research tool whereby satellite components and sub-assemblies (but not complete communications satellites) could be proved in actual spaceconditions by mounting them in small test satellites (200 lb. maximum).     Thefirst BLACK ARROW&quot; launching is planned for 1968-69 (whereas the FrenchDIAMANT rocket has already (November 1965) placed an 85 lb. satellite inorbit).     BLACK ARROW would give us direct practical experience of theproblems of injecting satellites into prescribed orbits and of controllingthem there without, however, any capability of injecting communicationsatellites into operational orbits.     The proposed programmes for thedevelopment and utilisation of BLACK ARROW and for continued research intobasic satellite technology are planned as a single integrated and self-contained project within a national space programme.     The satelliteexperiments launched by BLACK ARROW would enable us to achieve and maintain in this country at modest cost, an independent capability in satellitedesign and development and to demonstrate to prospective customers the viability of our components in space.-3-CONFIDENTiAL

CONFIDENTIAL -       &amp;:..10.   The experiments could he extended to include components and sub-systemsfor communication satellites.     We have considered what would he involved in getting launchers from U.S.A. for this purpose.    The United States might perhaps he prepared to allow us to carry out launching on their facilitieshut It would he difficult to rely on this if these launchings were designedto enable us to compete with the Americans in satellite technology.    moreover the Ministry of Aviation would say that launching on American facilities would not provide us with the technological experience required.11.   It might become possible, although the Americans have not permitted thisyet, to purchase launchers from U.S.A., and carry out launching3 at Woomera.This would avoid the cost of developing BLACK ARROW, but it would requireappreciable expenditure on the establishment of a new launch complex atWooinera to fit the American launchers, which would diminish this saving.     Inthe view of the Ministry of Aviation, It would be unwise to rely upon UnitedStates willingness to permit such purchases, especially when one purpose ofour operations would be to enable British firms to supply communicationssatellite components of British design to the global satellite system in competition with United States designs.     Others of us think that it would bedifficult for the United States Government to withhold such permission, in thelight of the international agreements which form the basis of the contractsprocedure of this system (paragraph 17 below), and the steps which UnitedStates firms are already talcing to place sub-contracts in United Kingdomand Europe.12,   The present estimated cost of developing the small satellite launcheritself is  9.5 million (including a contingency of about 17 per cent) spreadover a period of 4-6 years.     If the development proved successful, anoperational programme of 3 launchings of experimental satellites each year isexpected to cost  3.5 million a year including satellites, tracking and datareduction services.     The estimated overall cost of the programme is 42 million as set out in Annex C, paragraph 7,13.   The figures given in paragraph 12 do not include any provision for thedevelopment of a communications satellite, whether this is done eitherindependently or in collaboration with CETS (Appendix E).     If developedindependently, the estimated cost over five years would vary from  5 million for merely creating an adequate technological base, to  15.0 million for thecomplete development of a launch-proven satellite (two launches by ELDO or united States launchers).     For comparison, the United Kingdom share of ajoint European communications satellite development programme (including three launches by ELDO or two double launches by the U.S.A.) would be about 5.5 million over a similar period.-A-.&apos; A .&apos;, !

(&amp;)   Satellite Communications (Annex D)14.   Communication satellites are likely to play an important part in thefurther development of reliable worldwide communication services for commercial purposes.     An important aspect of this development is our membership of CETS (Annex E), which was established in 19^3 to consider what practical measures were needed to make the maximum European materialcontribution to the development of such an international system and topresent a united European front in negotiations with the United States anda number of Commonwealth and other countries that led in 1964 to thecreation of the Interim Committee on Satellite Communications (I.C.S.C.).Under the relevant interim Agreements a decision has been taken to establish an experimental international communications satellite system, and it ishoped that the basic system will be operational in the latter part of 19&amp;7-Our share of the total estimated costs of this system was originally 8.4 percent or about  6 million spread over a period of about five years, but with more countries joining in, the share has been reduced to 7.74 per cent andmay be reduced a little more in future.     In the long term this investmentcan be expected to become a commercial proposition.     The interim Agreementsprovide that, when proposals or tenders for equipment for the satellitesystem are comparable in quality, price and timely performance, contracts should be distributed between member states in approximate proportion totheir respective contributions.15.   CETS is at present considering a programme to establish in Europe acapability for the supply of equipment to the global system.     The space technology Committee of CETS has already produced outline proposals for thedevelopment of an experimental satellite and details of the entire proposedCETS programme for the development of a communications satellite includinglaunchings are available to member states,     GETS are asking Governments tomake clear very soon whether they are prepared to negotiate their participa-tion in such a programme.     It is estimated that this will cost  22 million,of which the United Kingdom share is expected to be  5.5 million (seeparagraph 12).     However there are certain pointers which indicate to us that the supply of equipment may be actually carried out through tenderingby international consortia of aero-space and electronics firms and efforts are being made to see whether the other members of CETS have entertainedsimilar ideas.     In the latest circumstances the United Kingdom should seek to avoid taking the initiative in a multilateral enterprise which might laterprove neither economically nor technologically viable.     The political consequences of talcing any fresh initiative in this way at the wrong time andon the wrong project could involve this country in a serious loss of politicalcredit - the very opposite of the objective that international collaboration in technology is designed to achieve.-5-CONFIDENTJAL

16.   The Defence Space Review Committee have recommended that if our commitments east of Suez continue and if a high level of flexibility andavailability of communications is regarded as of the highest importance,most of the existing high frequency links should be replaced by militarysatellite communications.     The latter are the subject of current discussions and combined experiments between ourselves and the United States.Potential Market for Global Satellite Systems17.   ^e have considered the possible extent of the export market for thesupply of equipment for the global satellite system.     It is open to UnitedKingdom industry to secure as much of this market as it can by making its performance and price competitive;   and the international agreement providesthat where this condition is satisfied the contracts should be distributed between the countries in approximate proportion to their contribution to the costs:   our share is 7.74 per cent (Annex D).     The United States share is56.24 per cent.     with their long lead in technology throughout the field, theAnerieans will be in a powerful competitive position.     They are likely,however, to be providing all the launchers (for it is most unlikely that ELDOor anyone else will be able to produce these competitively in price and efficiency), and this should give us an opportunity to press hard for abetter share for other equipment if we can supply competitively.18.   Eor earth stations, the United Kingdom should have opportunities forgetting business if our industry is competitive.     V/e have full designinformation and a British firm has obtained a contract (though not in inter-national competition) for a small capacity earth station to be erected inAscension Island in ^^66.     &quot;vTe did not, however, with full international competition obtain the contract for a similar earth station which is to be built in Australia, mainly on grounds of price and the fact that our designsdid not allow for hurricane protection, but the circumstances are somewhatobscure.     The total market up to 1970 is likely to be . 50-90 milliondepending on whether geostationary or moving satellites are used, and aboutthe sajne in the next five years.     T7e would put the maximum possible shareat 25 per cent, if we were leading in competitiveness, and this would giveover a ten-year period, say,  2-^-5 million a year of exports, and, say, one-third of this if we only got our standard share.r-o-

-7-o &amp;19-   For satellites, the total market up to 1975 including replacements oradditions to the basic-phase system is estimated at . 22-98 million.     Thereshould be prospects, if our electronics industry find it profitable to exploit them, for the supply of satellite components to the United Statescontractors either under licence or of wholly British design.     A Britishfirm has won the contract for the first ESRO satellite, against international competition, and although the prospects are less favourable than for earthstations there should be some prospects of saAes here.     The development cost for a communications satellite (including two launchings) is estimated at aminimum of  15 million in five years, and there is no provision for this inthe proposals before Ministers.     The range of uncertainty is too wide topermit an estimate of the exports that we might secure in a world market ofat most  10 million a year.     But it must be small in relation to thedevelopment cost, none of which would be likely to be recovered in the priceof the sales.20.   There is no prospect of our producing launchers for communicationssatellites competitively.21.   The best prospect is therefore in the market for earth stations, whichis both the largest market and the one which we are technically andcommercially in the best position to supply:   our prospects here do not depend upon whether or not we manufacture satellites or have nationallaunching facilities.     There is also a potential market for satellitecomponents.     The market for complete satellites is likely to bo small inrelation to the development cost.     Our chances of success T.rauld beincreased by a programme including BLACK ARA0&quot;.7.     But the potential volumeof exports in this field could only be small in relation to the cost to theGovernment of such a programme ( 42 million in ten years, Annex C) inaddition to the cost of development of the satellite itself.     Exports aretherefore hardly a factor in the decision whether or not to proceed withBLACK ARROW.

22.   Our current and future programme of activities in space (other thanstudies of work for purely military objectives) thus consists of thefollowing principal items, a measure of the relative cost of which is theestimated out-turn of expenditure in the years 1965/66 to 1971/72 asfollows -  million 1968-69&quot; !sM JorJLve1965-66   1966-67   1967-68      and and       years  966-621969-70    1971-72      to&apos;1970-71SoientificSpaceResearch (1) 5.0 5.7 6.0 6.0 6.0 29.7CivilCommunica-tions (2) 1 .25        1 .25        1 .25        1 .25 1 .25 6.25E1DC (3)       13.5       13.0        8.7- 8.7-        8.7-             47.8-10.9 10.9        10.9              56.6U.K. Tech-nologicalSpace Pro-gramme (4)    1 .7        3.0        3.6 4.3         4.8              20.0OtherM.O.A.spaceexpendi-ture (5)        1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 6.0C . -ii .T, S.(6) -       0.3       1.0        1.0 1.0 4.3TOTALS        20.65      24.45     21.75-    22.45-     22.95- 114.05-  million 23.95      24.65        25.15 122.85In each year.(1)   The estimates for 1967-68 to 1971-72 are based on the assumptiongiven in paragraph 3.

This is assumed to be thesame for 1971-72.(3)   The amount for 1965-66 may be  2.5 million higher on account ofexpenditure incurred in earlier years.     The amounts for 1967-68 to 1971-72are based on the assumption given in paragraph 6.-8-CON FIDE NTS AL

C ONI PI OP MTIAI&amp; 0 6(4)   Based on the Ministry of Aviation integrated programme includingdevelopment of BLACK ARROW (see Table in paragraph 7 of Annex C).     Forthe basic satellite technology programme alone, the estimated cost from1967-68 to 1970-71 would be  1 .3 million in each year but some provision would be needed for the creation of an adequate technological base forsatellite development of the order of  1 .0 million per year (seeparagraph 12).     Alternatively, independent development of a communicationssatellite would cost about  3.0 million per year for five years (see annex C).(5-)   This covers use of Skylark rockets for space technology experiments(up to  250,000 a year) and the balance of Ministry of Aviation extramuralexpenditure on space activities (about  950,000 a year) not included under item (A).(6)   Assuming the estimates given in Annex E (paragraph 1) are adhered to.23.   The present total cost is  20.65 million, of which the ELDO contribution is over 67 per cent.    Assuming that our expenditure on scientific space research and civil communications is not at issue, then if we remain in ELDO,join CETS but abandon BLACK ARROW while creating an adequate technologicalbase, our costs in 1971-72 are likely to be of the order of  21-23 million;leaving ELDO, but continuing with a full technological space programme(including BLACK ARROW) and joining CETS, the cost would be  14.5-16.5 million;whereas leaving ELDO and abandoning BLACK ARROW, but joining CETS andcreating an adequate technological base would cost  13-15 million.Space Policy24.   There has been considerable public criticism that the above activitiesdo not amount to a coherent space policy, and that there is no mechanism fordevising one.     In the sense that what we do does not cover the whole spacefield this is true.     But such a programme would require resources on thescale of those now employed by the United States and U.S.S.R, and this isclearly beyond our means.    We have therefore to direct our expenditure to specific fields in which we are or may become particularly interested and ensure that it is kept within our means.     Excluding military use, whichis considered separately, these fields are -(a) scientific research;(b) the use of space for communications of all kinds.-9-CONFIDENTJAL

25.   Both fields mainly involve satellites and associated tracking equipment.We are interested in launchers primarily to the extent that they are necessaryfor effective work on the satellite payloads, since, from our point of view,the launchers are only a means to an end (though unfortunately the means are more costly than the ends).    We do not propose in this paper to argue the justification for   continuing our activities in the scientific space researchfield, or for our contribution towards the Interim Committee on satellite communications, which we believe will turn out to be a commercial proposition.26.   We are therefore left with our own technological space programme,which includes our intra-mural and oxtra-nural rosoaroh (see paragraph 8),a contribution towards a European programme for the joint development ofsatellites (GETS), and the small satellite launcher, and finally and mostimportantly, in view of its cost, our future policy towards ELDO.27.   There is common ground that there is no justification for this workon economic grounds.     This was the view taken by the Task Group on public expenditure in its report last January, and economic justification has never been part of the case put to Ministers.      The analysis of the potentialmarket for exports of equipment for the global satellite system summed upin paragraph 21   shows that the possible gains to be made as a result ofa space programme are too small in relation to the cost to be given weightin the decision.28.   Moreover, this work engages high quality scientists and technologistssome of whom might otherwise be employed on work of direct economic value;nor do any recent investigations, either in the United States or in theUnited Kingdom, support the view that the indirect gains (the so-called&quot;spin-off&quot;) justify expenditure on such a scale.     There is no argumenton the score of national prestige, which could equally well be used for our undertaking expenditure in a very large number of other fields, e.g. under-water research.29.   The argument in favour is that the use of space, particularly for communications, is something in which the United Kingdom does have a sub-stantial interest;   that in international discussions relating to the useof space it is of value to us that our international status should be supported by technological knowledge;   and perhaps, most important of all,that space is a field where developments may falsify predictions and wheretherefore it may be worth while to expend some resources in order to maintain a place.     Moreover, unless we are able to contribute something to inter-national discussion in: this field, other nations may be unwilling to make available to us their knowledge and we might lose access to information which might prove to be of importance to us.-10-CONFIDENTJAL

Deoislona to be taken30.   The question to be decided is the size and nature of our spaceprogramme.     It is common ground that v/e should continue the scientificspace research programme, rising from  3 million in 1965-66 to  6 million a year by 1968-69;   and that we should continue our contribution to the interim Committee on Satellite Communications ( 1^: million a year).31. There are two questions to be decided, the answer to the first having a direct bearing on the second -(i)   whether United Kingdom should continue to support ELDO (cost 12.0 million in 1966-67 and  V7.8-56.6 million in the next five years);(ii)   whether United Kingdom should continue a national technologicalspace programme including BLACK ARROW (cost  if.2 million in1966-67 and  26 million in the next five years) and examine in due course whether we should play a part in any CETS (say, 5.5 million in the next five years).-11-

-12-(U fi \m A! A&apos;.: A-\l,*  %mELDO32,   Our main difficulties relate to continuing expenditure on ELDO afterthe end of 19&amp;5A     ^e agreed facts are -(i)   Expenditure on ELDO is at present 67 per cent of our totalexpenditure on space activities,(ii)   The programme is of no interest to our scientific research foreven if, contrary to present expectations, ELDO can provide alauncher for ESRO in competition with the United States, thiswould only justify it as a eupplier of equipment and not as adirect contributor to the ESRO programme,(iii)   There would be a diminishing t echnological interest for theUnited Kingdom in future programmes if our work consisted solely,as seems likely, in the further development and production of the flight-tested BLUE STREAK.     It is possible that a new ELDOprogramme, using advanced propulsion systems related to a specific launching requirement, couldbe of technologicalinterest.     But the cost of such a programme would be verylarge, and we should need to negotiate an extension of existing arrangements for sub-contracting the production of BLUE STREAKto our partners to enable us to take a satisfactory share ofthe worthwhile elements of such a programme.     But this mightnot be possible, for it Is unlikely that any of our partnerscould manufacture BLUE STREAK more cheaply than ourselves,and this would add to the already over-burdened ELDO budget.The continuance of the ELDO programme cannot therefore bejustified on technological grounds,(iv)   The minimum rate of economic production of ELDO launchersis three a year, and since there are no firm customers for atotal of more than two or three at the most, there can be nofinancial return, and the economic spin-off seems likely to beall but zero.     Indeed the economic arguments are all the other way, as such expenditure ties up resources as well as costingcash.(v)   In considering other customers, it must be borne in mind that on present plans ELDO will never produce a better launcher than theUnited States.    As stated in paragraph 8, an ELDO launcher may need a production subsidy if it is to be competitive in pricewith its American equivalent.

-13-o a n33.   It is agreed that the economic, financial and technological considerationsfavour our ending the ELDO commitment as soon as is practicable.     There isno legal or contractual obstacle to this.     No member of ELDO can formallywithdraw before 1969, but members are committed to finance the initialprogramme (ELDO A) only until 3&apos;ist December, 1965, and any country can endits active participation by refusing to contribute beyond that date.     Therewill be a meeting in mid-December to determine the 1966 budget, and theGovernment could then define what, if any, financial contribution they wouldmake in that year.34.   The difficulty is not of law but of foreign policy,     ELDO was formed in 1962 on United Kingdom initiative, and although the cost estimate forELDO A has escalated from the original figure of  70 million to 150 million, and the economic and technological arguments are modifiedaccordingly, a withdrawal would appear as a reversal of policy, and a moveaway from co-operation with Europe.     This would occur at a moment when theGovernment ere doing their best to reduce divisions between the Six and therest.     The Foreign Office accordingly attach great weight to the damage which disengagement from ELDO could do to the Government&apos;s interests inEurope where it would be seen as an act of bad faith reinforcing the notionof British unreliability, weakening the resolve of the Five to stand up tode Gaulle and encouraging French domination of an inward-looking Europeantechnological grouping.     They point out that the political odium -would bemarkedly increased if It were to become known that we were embarking onBLACK ARR07f;   for the other partners would claim that the United Kingdom hadbenefitted most from the work of ELDO so far, since v/e had continued todevelop and flight-test BLUE STREAK, and that we were now withdrawing inorder to carry out a purely national, launcher capability.     Much may bema.de of the argument that the combination of a reliable first stage(BLUE STREAK) and a nationally developed upper stage (BLACK ARROW&quot;) -already referred to in the British press as a possibility - could produce a national large launcher capability, which the United Kingdom, by with-drawing from ELDO, would have denied to Europe as part of a co-operativeenterprise.     ^he Ministry of Aviation, which -was the Department in the leadin 1962 and since, have great sympathy with the views of the Foreign Office.35.   It is also important to bear in mind that Australia was encouraged by theBritish Government to become a founder member of the ELDO and Australiaprovides facilities for testing the launcher at &quot;oomera in lieu of othersubscription towards the costs of the Organisation,     Cancellation of further work on the ELDO launcher would deprive the Australian Government of the

CONFIDENT1AL2   financial and other &quot;benefits which they are- expecting to obtain from the useof Woomera for testing the launcher.     The Commonwealth Relations Officepoint out that the Australian Government nay in consequence ask that the contribution of the British Government towards Woomera should be increased.36.    On the other hand it is recognised that although the difficultiesof disengaging from ELDO now appear great, the next stage would be to commit ourselves and the organisation to a programme which had no economic,scientific and t echnologioal merits at all commensurate with their cost,with the likelihood that a further occasion would be virtually certain to arise in which we should be confronted with exactly the same situation,more deeply committed and embedded.     Whether the political difficultiesof withdrawing would be greater then than now, however, is problematical.37.   If other members of ELDO shared our doubts about the economic and technological value of its programme, there would be less difficulty indisengaging ourselves.     But the Foreign Office consider that unless wecould get a wide measure of formal agreement we should continue our participation, and that the cost of this, perticularly in relation to someof the other international organisations to which we subscribe, does not seem to be excessive,38.   The other members of ELDO are unlikely to be as impressed as we are by its economic and technological drawbacks.     Barring France, they aretechnologically less  advanced than ourselves and went into ELDO (as did we)with the aim of developing space technology in Europe.     Their financial problems are less, since our- subscription (38.8 per cent) is much thelargest, though the Germans, for example, face a serious budget problem.Any doubts they feel are unlikely to be expressed.    This places us in thedisagreeable tactical position of having to speak first.39.   In the light of these considerations, the most important decision for ministers is v/hether Her Majesty&apos;s Government wish to continue to supportELDO or whether they wish to withdraw.     The views of Departments, set outin paragraphs 27 to 31, show that on economic, financial and technical grounds, the concensus of opinion is in favour of withdrawal, but theForeign Office, supported by the Ministry of Aviation, are opposed to such acourse for political reasons.     If Ministers decide we should continueto support ELDO, we shall seek to re-negotiate our share of the costs andto obtain a share of the technically interesting work in the new programme

to be considered at the ELDO meeting in March, 19&amp;6.     If on the other handMinisters decide that we should withdraw, the contractual and politicaltactics to be adopted will be considered further by officials in -the nearfuture with a view to deciding the line to be taken at the forthcomingCouncil meeting of ELDO oh 20th December, 1965, when the 1966 budget forELDO A has to be decided.     In doing this, they will bear in mind thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government has stated in the House of Lords that:, atthe March 1966   meeting of ELDO we shall, together with our partners,have to consider the estimates very carefully in relation to -the technologicaladvantages to be derived from present and possible future programmes,40,   The issue for decision here is whether the teclmological space programme(lines 4 and 5 of the Table in paragraph 22), including BLACK ARROW, over and above the scientific and I.C.S.C. programmes, contributes to the objectives in paragraph 29 sufficiently to warrant e expenditure of the resourcesinvolved,.The Treasury, the Department of Economic Affairs and the Board ofTrade remain unconvinced of the economic case in favour of proceeding withthe programme, and consider that the size and quality of the scientificspace research programme is of some significance in relation to the arguments in paragraph 39.     The Post Office too are doubtful if the export market is sufficiently large to justify the expenditure on research and development.The Ministry of Aviation on the other hand favour the programme as the cheapest means of preserving our interest in spree technology, and theyare supported in this view by the Ministry of Technology,Conclusion41 *   The continued programme of scientific space research and our financialand administrative contribution towards the international system under the interim Committee on Satellite Communications are not at issue.     ministers are therefore invited to decide: -(i)   Whether or not it should be the objective of Government policy to withdraw from SLDO.(ii)   whether to continue expenditure on basic satellite technology(as indicated in Annex C, paragraph 7) and supporting work,(iii)   Whether to go forward with the BLACK ARROW programme.-15-CO-AA :AAVAA-,

(1)CONFIDENTIALMNEX A6 u SIScientific Space research .     The term &quot;scientific space research&quot;, as used in the United Kingdom,refers to the acquisition of scientific knowledge by observations orexperiments depending on the use of sounding rockets or satellites, whichhave grown from small beginnings in 1957.     The Science Research council are responsible for this work under the general control of the Secretary ofState for Education and Science.     This includes the award of grants to universities and all administrative matters arising in connection with the scientific space research programme, the formulation and arrangements forthe execution of a programme for support of scientific space research, and responsibility for United Kingdom participation in the European space research Organisation and United Kingdom co-operation with the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration of the U.S.A. and with other national and international governmental space research agencies.     The Royal Societyis responsible for non-governmental United Kingdom space researchactivities stemming from the International Council of Scientific unions and COSPAR.European Space Research Organisation (ESRO)2.     The ESRO Convention, vdiich entered into force on 21st March, 1962f,has been ratified by Belgium, Denmark, Prance, Germany and the Netherlands,Italy, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland arid the United Kingdom.     The Conventionbinds the member states to continue in the organisation for the initial period of eight years (up to 1972) for which they have agreed to contributetotal resources of 1,500 million French francs (about  110 million) at 1962prices.     The shares of all the original potential members have been worked out on the basis of their average net national incomes the United kingdom share being 25 per cent, and that of V/est   Germany and France being21.5 per cent and 18.2 per cent respectively.     On present plans theUnited Kingdom will have been required to contribute by March 1972 up to 27.5 million at 1962 prices (our contribution in 1965-66 is  1.75 million).By 1970 decisions will have to be taken in the ESRO Council on the level of resources to be made available to the Organisation in the ninth and subsequent years.3.     ESRO has no firm programme for its first eight years.     There is a document setting out the very considerable numbers of rockets and satellites,DV types, which it is the aim to launch, insofar as this may prove possilbe within the eight year financial ceiling.     It is already known that not allthese desired launchings can be afforded and a major review is being undertaken this year,:    However, it is expected that ESRO will launch perhapsthree hundred sounding rockets and about twelve satellites by 1972.

(2)4.     In July 1965, the ESRO Council agreed, on a recommendation from itsScientific and Technical Committee, to plan its Large AstronomicalSatellite (L.A.S.) project on the basis of the present stated parametersof the ELDO launcher (see Appendix B), which assume the use of an equatoriallaunch site.     This decision followed from the fact that although ESRO has never entered into a formal commitment to use ELDO launchers, there hasalways been an understanding to this effect and Article 12(2) of the ELDOConvention calls for the closest possible co-operation between the two.The ESRO Council recorded that any substantial departure from theparameters of the ELDO launcher, or any important delay in the launchschedule, would exclude its use.     This decision is subject to review intwo years * time (1968) and there can be no ESRO commitment until after that stage.    A decision by ESRO to use the ELDO vehicle would provide ELDO witha specific objective instead of developing a launcher for which there is noidentified requirement.     But the ESRO requirement, if it materialises,would not exceed one proven ELDO A launcher to the present parameters in1971-72 and another in 1972-73.5.     On present ELDO plans the ELDO A launcher should be available from1969 and a steady production of three Blue Streaks per annum is desirableto keep down unit costs,     Production for the ESRO requirement would therefore be most economically arranged as part of a programme in which atleast two other Blue Streaks were used each year for development work e.g,in connection with ELDO or CETS programmes.     No such programmes have as yet been approved nor can such approval yet be assumed, nor can the cost ofan ELDO launcher for ESRO be determined at present.     The cost of such alaunching was estimated in 19&amp;4 at  2.85 million on the hypothetical basisof an ELDO programme requiring four Blue Streaks per annum.     This estimateexcludes the coat of an equatorial launching site ( 7-10 million for   con-struction and  1 08 million per year running costs according to French estimates;but thes3  are undoubtedly low) which - failing agreement on ELDO B and/ora CETS programme using ELDO A - would be needed only for ESRO firings;   itis in any case currently being re-examined.     The price which ESRO mighthave to pay NASA for an alternative launching using an ATMS/AGENA rockethas been established as a result of recent ESRO/NASA discussions as of theorder of  2.85 million,     If fewer ELDO launchings are commissioned, thecost of ELDO vehicles may have to be subsidised to make then competitive in price with their American counterparts, otherwise the S3R0 programme wouldhave to be reduced in order to find the extra cost of using ELDO vehicleswithin the agreed eight-year financial ceiling.

ANNEX BEuropean Launcher Development organisation.      The European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) was set up in1962 with as its aim the development and construction of space vehiclelaunchers and their equipment suitable for peaceful application fcr supply to eventual users.   The organisation consists of the United Kingdom, Prance,West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and Australia.   The UnitedKingdom made available without charge, all the work it had done prior to november 1961 on the manufacture of BLUE STREAK, which would be useful forsatellite launcher purposes (apprcodmate expenditure  67 million).   Australiacontributed appropriate range and supporting facilities at Woomera andtechnical co-operation based wn scientific experience in conducting trials andassessments.   The cost r,f &apos;--,he initial ELDO programme was estimated to be 70 million spread over five years of which the United Kingdom share was tobe 38.8 per cent ( 27,3 million).   By the end of 1964 ELDO had spent 50 million on. its prr.gi-.mme, including  21 million in the United Kingdom.In this period the technical contribution by our scientists has been considerable not only as regards the successful development of BLUE STREAK,but also as advisers to the Secretariat of ELDO and to the other participating countries in such matters as guidance and telemetry.   This contribution hasbeen recognised by th^ Em-opeans and has enhanced the standing uf curtechnologists in sther related fields.   In addition some political goodwillhas been engendered from our participation with the principal members of the six in a large-scale peaceful technological project&apos;.   Continuation df workon BLUE STREAK under ELDO has also helped to develop and maintain thefacilities that form part of the United Kingdom/Australia joint project atWoomera, where BLUE STREAK has already had three successful firings.2.      It was apparent for some time, however, that the initial estimate of 70 million would be exceeded owing to difficulties in accurate financialestimate in a new technological field, in which several of the partners had noprevious experience, nor had any provision been made for general inflationarytrends.   Accordingly the ELDO Secretariat prepared in 1964- a revised estimate ofthe cost to completion of the initial programme, which totalled  117.5 milliontogether with the contingency allowance of  25.5 million and an addition of 7 million for economic factors making  150 milli on in all of which theUnited Kingdom share is  58.2 million.   As we will have contributed  29.million up to the end of 1965, this leaves  28.6 million still to be paidif the programme on ELDO A is to be completed.   An inter-governmental conference was held in Paris in January 1965 to consider this revised estimate but failedto reach any conclusion because the French made radical proposals to stwp workon the current ELDO programme and to proceed with an advanced type of launcherat once.   A Working Group was however set up to examine the French and other proposals and to report to the reconvened conference in April 1965.(3)

4.      A further int er-governmental conference will be held in March 1966at which a firm revised estimate of the cost to completion of the ELDO a programme on the basis of the new target plan would be available.   This willenable major policy decisions on the future activities of ELDO to be made.If Ministers take the view that the United Kingdom commitment to ELDO should be terminated as coon as possible it might be necessary to take some preparatorysteps to this end somewhat earlier.   It is relevant that under the ELDO a programme the principal United Kingdom share wf the work is the BLUE STREAKprogramme but proposals currently under examination and which have widesupport from the European members would ensure that each member state can expect in the long run the same proportion of work in relation to its contribution and also equal proportions of interesting work.   The continueddevelopment and production of BLUE STREAK for future programmes would be ofdiminishing technological interest to us.   If, as we hope to negotiate,our contribution to future ELDO programmes is reduced to about 25 per cent weshould have to sub-contract to our partners some of the BLUE STREAK work toenable us to take up our share of the more advanced developments.5.    Assuming our contribution to the future ELDO programme will be 25 per cent,and the provisional estimate of cost of this programme ( 110 million) given inparagraph 2 is correct, that the programme for ELDO A is to be completed, thatan equatorial launching base is constructed and in operation by 1972 (see Annex Aparagraphs 4 and 5) then, - together with Secretariat and range rental coststotalling  2.5 million, our total commitment to ELDO in the next seven years(1966-72) will be  61.1 million ( 32.5 million for the future programme, plus the  28.6 million outstanding for ELDO A).   This implies an average yearly outlayof some  3.4 million over this period.   On the other hand, if our contributionremains at 38.8 per cent, the expenditure would be  10.9 million per year.CONFIDENTIAL(4)At this all countries except the French (who reserved their position) &quot; 2 7^accepted the principle that if ELDO was to continue in existence the ELDO Bprogramme was the most desirable objective for the early 1970*s and thatthe intitial three-stage ELDO programme (ELDO A) together with the developmentof an aopgee motor (ELDO A/S) were on technical grounds the best foundation for the ELDO B programme.   The cost of this programme is provisionallyestimated to be  110 million (ELDO A/S,  25 million; ELDO B1,  85 million)in addition to the amount required to develop ELDO A.   No country acceptedany financial commitment to this beyond continuing with expenditure on the initial programme during 1965 pending studies on the cost of these futureprogrammes.3.      Since then   the ELDO Council has adopted a revised target plan forELDO A which increased the number of development firings from ten to eleven,as a result of which the development programme will end in April 1969 instead ofJune 1967.   This would still meet the ESRO timetable mentioned in Appendix A(paragraph 1+).   The Secretariat estimate the increased cost involved at about 14 million, which would reduce the contingency allowance in the  150 millionestimate to about  12 million.

ANNEX G 9 1----- w e;United Kingdom Technological Space programme .     British v;ork in the satellite field began late in 1 959 when the RoyalAircraft Establishment (R.A.E.) began to study design and technologicalproblems.     Fron early in 1 9&amp;0 some very modest extramural support (about 60,000 a year) was also provided.     The R.A.E. studies embraced severalpossible projects, and by 1961 a design study of an astronomical satellitehad been completed as well as, in conjunction with the Post Office, a designstudy of a civil communications satellite system.     In 1962 the R.A.E. beganintramural studies on four Staff Targets for military space systems, and reported on these in the following year.     In 1963 two preliminary designstudies of scientific satellites were carried out on repayment terms forthe European Space Research Committee (ESRO), and a project study was alsocompleted of communication satellite systems (military as well as civil) inwhich work to the value of about  200,000 was carried out by industry.     Aorkis now nearing completion on a subsequent project study for a limited BritishDefence Satellite Communications System to a Staff Requirement of theMinistry of Defence, and for this study about . 100,000 of work will becarried out by industry.     It does not follow that the United Kingdom will necessarily establish an independent military communications satellitesystem;    the most likely outcome at present is participation in an Americansystem using American satellites and launchers but with British groundstations at our own terminals.2.     In 1963 a start was made in industry on a programme of research anddevelopment concerning the basic elements in satellite technology.     Suchtechnology involves knowledge of such items as the development of solar cellsfor satellite power supplies, the effect of space environment on electroniccomponents, mechanical devices and on materials, and the development of attitude sensing and control systems which are essential for the design ofany satellite.     The programnme consists of a series of relatively smallprojects and studies, seme of which extend over two or mere years.     Thetotal expenditure so far authorised is  650,000 and. this will soon be whollycommitted.     In order to support a civil or military space programme thesatellite studies would have to be continued, over a period of years at a levelof about  500,000 a year.3.     The commencement of a basic satellite technology programme was aprerequisite to the provision by the Ministry of Aviation of the scientificsatellite U.K.3 which will be launched fi-ee by tin america (NASA) as part of theBritish scientific space research programme.     This project, on which workbegan effectively on 1st January, 1964, is estimated to cost  1,100,000 andis due for completion&apos;by the end of 1966.     As the first satellite to be designed and built entirely in Britain it has significance beyond its immediatescientific purpose.     This practical experience of building a satellitecomplements the basic satellite technology programme in establishing a(5)

(6)CONFIDENTIALo !&apos; ftBritish industrial capability in this field of work.     As a result, a Britishfirm, in the face of intense European competition, has won the contract forthe first ESRO satellite and another British firm was third on the shortlist.     We did not compete for the second ESRO satellite but a British firmwas second on the short list for the third.     The costs of U.K.3, though notthose of the supporting technological programme, are a charge to the scientific space research programme described in paragraph 1 of Annex A.ij.     Besides the programmes described above, the Ministry of Aviationcommenced studies in 1954 on the development of a small satellite launchingvehicle (S.S.T,.) plAgK /fflROW.     The proposed programmes for the development and utilisation   of BLACK ARROW and for the continued research into basicsatellite technology are planned together as a single integrated and self-contained project within the nationa&quot;1 space programme.     The purpose of thesmall satellite launcher would be to provide British industry and Britishscientists with a research facility which would on the one hand enable the carrying &quot;out, in actual space conditions of the experiments which areabsolutely necessary to test the functioning of satellite and satellitecomponents and on the other enable direct oxperienoc to be gained of theproblems of injecting satellites into proscribed orbits and controllingthorn there.5.     Eor these purposes it is desirable, in the view of the Ministry of aviation, not only to have a launcher costing much less than ELDO A or itsAmerican equivalent, but also to have one wholly under United Kingdomnational control.     This would, they suggest, enable the United Kingdom tomake a fully effective technical contribution to international space programmes and also strengthen our influence in the work of international bodies suchas ELDO, ESRO and ICSC (see Appendix D).6. The complete development programme for a three-stage satellite launchervehicle, which would be capable of placing a 200 lb. payload into a 300 n.m.polar orbit from Joomera would comprise:-(a) the development of the launch vehicle;(b) the development of suitable test satellites;    and(c) the provision of the necessary tracking and data handlingfacilities.

7.     The following table shows the estimated costs for the above programme asthey might fall on the Ministry of Aviation Vote over the next ten years forthe development and subsequent utilisation of Black Arrow and the essentialbasic satellite technology programme.Total for ^*1964/5 Next A    Totaland    1966/7 1967/8 1968/9 1 969/70 1970/1   years      for1965/6 1971/72- 101974/75 years(i)   Black ArrowDevelopment O.96     1.95     2.34     2.10    1 .40    0.75        - 9.50(ii)   Basic satellitetechnology 0.50     0.40    0.50    0.50    0.50 . 0.50      2.0       4.90(iii)   Black Arrowutilisation - upto 3 launchingsa year, withsatellites - 0.90      1.60   2.75    14.0      19.25(iv)   Intramuralcomprehensivecosts in supportof above extra-mural work 0.94     0.65     0.80     0.80      0.80   0.80      3.20      7.99Total.0m. 2.40    3.00    3.64    4.30     4.30  4.80    19.20    41.64Note 1:   A provisional estimate cf the annual cost of 3 Black Arrowlaunchings, with the satellites, tracking and data reductionservices is  3.5 million made up as follows: n.LaunchingsTracking, data reductionetc. 2.5Satellites 1 .03.5 million the main table above assumes that expenditure would build up tothis rate by 1970-72 as the development phase came to an end.Note 2:   The Bondi committee gave a figure of  5 million per annum forthe total above; this appears to have been rounded up from thesame be.sic figures.Note 3:    The intramural costs (iv) include  0.35 million rising to 0.50 million on intramural basic satellite technology (ii).(7)

8.     It should be stressed that the figures given in paragraph 7, are for theS.S.L.programme alone, which although allowing us to test the componentsdestined for larger satellites (e.^. communications satellites), does not permit complete development of such satellites themselves.     For this purpose the Bondi Committee estimated that  8.5 million was required excludinglauncliings and ground stations.     A minimum programme to include two launchin-by ELDO-A or an American equivalent is estimated to cost -215 million in allover five years.     For comparison, the United Kingdom share of a jointEuropean programme for satellite development (including three launchings tyELDO-A or two double launchings by American launchers) would cost 5.5 million;   and the creation of an adequate technological base withoutco-operation or launching about  5.0 million (both over five years).(8)

ANNEX DSatellite Communications1.     Her Majesty&apos;s Government1s policy regarding communication satelliteswas stated in Parliament in February, 1964 in the following terms -&quot;The Government&apos;s objective is the creation of a world systemof satellite communications, in partnership with the United States,the Commonwealth, European and other countries, on conditionsv/hich will give countries investing in the system a share in settling its design and character, and in its management andcontrol, and the opportunity to provide some of the equipment.&quot;2.     Diuring 1963, the United Kingdom, France and a number of european countries established the European Conference of Satellite Communications(CSTS see Appendix E).   In 1964, formal negotiations began with the UnitedStates, Canada, Australia and Japan which led to the drawing up of twoInterim Agreements covering the establishment of a global satellite system,under an Interim Committee on Satellite Communications (ICSC).The Interim Agreements3.     The first Agreement was between governments;   it set out general objectives in the field of satellite communications and the conditions tobe applied, and it established interim arrangements for a global satellitesystem.     The second was an operating Agreement between telecommunicationentities, i.e. one covering financial and technical provisions.   TheAgreements are designedly of an interim character intended to cover thefirst five years or so.   The intention is that they will be superseded bydefinitive arrangements not later than the 1st January 1970, the characterof those arrangements to be determined in the light of experience.   Theoriginal United Kingdom share of the total estimated costs of the globalsystem was 8.4 per cent, or about  6.0 million spread over a period ofabout five years but this has been reduced as more countries have entered the Agreement and now stands at 7*74 per cent.   Payments  are made fromthe Post Office Fund, and the financial return are related to -fcbepercentage subscribed, made out of profits which the ICSC will make byleasing circuits in the space segment to telecommunication entities.4,     The inter-governmental Agreement provides that when proposals ortenders for equipment for the satellite system are comparable in quality,price and timely performance, the Interim Committee shall seek to ensurethat contracts are distributed between States in approximate proportion totheir respective contributions to the costs of the system.   Because of thelong lead which the U.S.A. has in satellite technology, it must be accepted that much of the initial equipment will be of American origin.   And indeed,(9)

(10)O H Qher predominant financial share (originally 61.0 per cent;   now 56.24 percent) will ensure that a larger proportion of the equipment for the later stages will also he American.     It should be realised, however, that it is unlikely that any European launcher will be able to compete with thoseproduced by the U.S.A., and thus the latter country will have to supply thebulk, if not all, the launchers required for the system.     Since launchersare the most expensive component, it follows that they will account for the major part of the U.S.A. share of the contracts.     On the assumption thattenders are at least comparable in terms of price, quality and delivery datethere will be a proportionately higher share of the satellite market forother advanced countries.5.     The launch in April 1965 and subsequent operation of the first experi-mental (Early Bird) satellite for the I.C.S.C. has been most successful andhas greatly increased confidence in the use of synchronous satellites for communications purposes though this cannot be conclusively judged until theend of 1965 when the acceptability of this type of satellite to telephoneusers will have been properly assessed.     In the meantime, the I.C.S.C, isnow on the point of agreeing the specification for a satellite   which can beused at either synchronous or medium altitude and it is probable that orderswill be placed early in 1966 for such satellites&apos; to be delivered in 1 967 and early 1968.     As mentioned in Appendix B, paragraph 3, there appears to belittle prospect that ELDO will have developed the capability to put asynchronous satellite into orbit before 1970, and the annual I.C.S.C.requirement for launchers after the initial period in which the global system is established will be low.     This limits the use of the ELDO launcher, erenif competitive with the U.S.A. equivalents, to the putting into orbit ofoccasional replacement satellites.     This also places on CETS the requirement to show that their programme will give Europe the ability to produce at least as good satellites as can the United States at some given date in the future.6.     The establishment of the basic-phase global system is expected torequire between 6 and 24 satellites, depentling on the orbit chosen and the capacity provided.     The required average life is five years, so the average rate of replacement will be between 1 and 5 satellites per annum.     on present estimates the basic-phase communication-satellite system willprovide sufficient capacity up to about 1975, and further capacity may beprovided either by the construction of an additional sub-system or byadditions of extra satellites or by replacements of the original satellitesby ones of larger capacity.

It is likely that by 1970 some 35 earth stations will, have been constructed, of which it is probable that at least 10 will be in Europe,North America and Japan and will be constructed by the countries in whichthey are placed including the United Kingdom,     The remaining 2j5 might beopen to international competition;   if the system used geo-stationarysatellites perhaps up to 6 of the latter would have two aerials and costsome  3.0 million each;   the remainder would cost perhaps half as muchmaking the total market some  46 million;   if the system used movingsatellites the cost might be up to  90 million.     A further 35 stationswill probably be required by 1975, but no estimate of their cost can bemade at the present time.     Development and construction of earth stationsis at an advanced state in the United Kingdom and the full design(11)Basic-phase system 6m. -  24m.9 *y q7,     The estimated cost of each satellite for the basic-phase system is w I &apos;-&apos;between  0.5 million and  1.0 million depending on the number required, andthus the cost of the basic system is likely to lie between  6 million and 24 million with an annual replacement cost of  1 million to  5 million.Although our present basio share is 7.74 per cent it could be optimisticallyargued that the United Kingdom might obtain as much as 25 per cent of thesatellite orders if a strong lead in competitiveness can be established.Thus the total satellite market that might become available to the UnitedKingdom for civil purposes in the period up to 1975 can be estimated to fallv/ithin the following ranges - m.

POMFinFMTI AlO !) Ufat   Oinformation is available to British industry;   in fact, a British firmhas already obtained a contract for the small capacity earth station whichis to be erected in Ascension Island in 19^6.     On the other hand, Britishindustry failed by a vri.de margin to secure the order for a similarstation in Australia which went to an American firm.     Moreover, there are indications of a tendency to link orders for earth station with aidprogrammes.     However, the Ascension Island contract indicates that it isnit necessary for the United Kingdom to manufacture satellites in order twbe able to compete in the ground station market.     On the very optimisticassumption that we could obtain up to 25 per cent of the contracts, theUnited kingdom&apos;s shaie of the market would be  11.5 or  22.5 milliondepending on the type of satellite system employed.9.     It can be seen that on the most optimistic forecasts eur total shareof the market over ten years is likely t* be not more that  70 million,and may be very much less if United Kingdom industry is unable to make its performance and price highly competitive.

(13)w U annex EEuropean ^nf^ej^enoji^o^ Satellite Communications (CBTS) - European research and Development Frogrannes1.    The objective of the CETS programmes (MISC. 3l/l, paragraph 85) is toestablish in Europe a capability for the supply of equipment to the globalsatellite communications system.     The original estimate of the total costof the programmes up to 1970 was thought to be of the order of  16 millionbut has since been provisionally increased to  22 million, of which our share,should we decide to enter into Agreement, would be about  5.5 million (25l).The Space Technology Committee of CETS has produced outline proposals for theco-ordinated development of an experimental satellite, and sufficientinformation on all aspects of a CETS development programme should beavailable in time for the CETS plenary session to take decisions on itearly in 1966.2.     Although the United Kingdom has taken the view that we cannot commit ourselves to a programme of work until we have decided upon the extent ofour commitment to ELDO, we have participated in discussions on co-ordinatedprogrammes in order to avoid undue delay, and in these discussions we havebeen assisted by the work we have undertaken at our own expense on theoreticalcommunications satellite studies and early work on basic satellite technologywithout any specific communications applications (Appendix C).     In view ofthe rapid developments mentioned in paragraph 5 of Annex D it now seems unlikely that CETS can achieve its original aim of developing a Europeansatellite which could compete in tine and price with the latest Americandesigns, particularly as on the most optimistic forecasts Europe could nothave its experimental satellite operational until the early 1970s and could at best hope to obtain only very small orders after that tine.     It may therefore be better to concentrate on the creation of an adequate technologicalbase, which would enable European firms or consortia to compete or collaborate with American firms for particular aspects of a communications system.     Weare now attempting to establish informally how far our CETS partners holdthis view.     In the light of their reactions we shall have to considerwhether and by what means we should seek to have it formally accepted by CETS.3.     The extent to which our partners are willing to reassess CETS originaldevelopment policy will be an important factor in determining our reaction to the development proposals which are now being prepared for a jointly-financed CETS programme.     Other relevant factors are the future of ELDO,the advantages of bilateral technological co-operation against the multilateral CETS proposals, the scope, cost and likely outcome of theseproposals and the possibility that the supply of equipment will be met throughtendering by international consortia of aero-space and electx^onic firms.
