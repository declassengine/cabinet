G(66) 99 COPY MO.8th July, 1966CABINETTHE GROWTH RATE AND PRODUCTIVITYMemorandum by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic AffairsThe Outlook for GrowthThe National Plan set a target of 25 per cent for the growth ofnational output between 1964 and 1970.    None of us ever thought that itwould be easy to achieve this target.    But I must warn my colleagues thatthere is now an increasing danger that we shall not do so.    This has anumber of important consequences for our policies.2.      The Plan target implied an average rate of growth of 3.8 per cent a year between 1964 and 1970, but made it clear that the rate of growthwould be below this average in the early years, while we were getting thebalance of payments right.    This meant, of course, that the rate of increase would have to be correspondingly higher in the later years.3.      In the event, output in 1965 was only 2-2f per cent higher than in1964.    The official forecasts suggest that output will continue to rise at about this rate to the end of 1967.4,      There are two main factors limiting the growth of output in currentcircumstances.    The first is the rate of growth of our capacity to produce,The second is the limit placed on the expansion of demand in order to meet our balance of payments difficulties, i.e. the extent of the restraintsimposed by budgetary and monetary policy.5.      Up to now both these factors have played a part in the recent slowrate of growth.    Some industries have been held back by shortage oflabour and capacity, others by shortage of demand.    Over the comingperiod, however (given a continuation of existing policies), the mainlimitation on output is likely to become more and more the rate of growth of demand.    In other words, the capacity of the economy to produce can reasonably be expected to rise by more than the rate of about 2-2-1 per cena year at which demand is expected to rise.6.       But despite these restraints the balance of payments in 1967 islikely to remain unsatisfactory.    Nor does the longer term prospectindicate that the balance of payments is likely to permit any rapid expansion in 1968.-1-SECKETHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)67
setting,&apos;,..r.,&quot;7.      Yet the expected rate of expansion on present policies, up to theend of 1967, v/ould leave us with a need to expand at an average of over  per cent a year in the last three years of the Plan period for the25 per cent target to be achieved.8.      We must consider how our policies need to be developed orstrengthened to improve the prospects for growth.Productivity9.      Even if there were no balance of payments limitations, the poorgrowth of productivity since 1964 suggests that there might be difficultiesin achieving the growth target.    Output per head has been growing at only about lj per cent a year.    Although part of this disappointing performancewas due to a reduction in working hours, it compares unfavourably withthe average rate of 3.4 per cent a year required by the Plan.10.       The experience of individual industries has, however, varied very considerably.    A fair number of industries have been showing increases in productivity fully comparable with the average rates of increase for1964-70 forecast in the Plan.    These are mainly industries where demandhas remained high.    They include electrical engineering, scientificinstruments, clothing, paper and board, rubber, and chocolate and sugarconfectionery.11.       Among industries where productivity has grown less quickly thanthe Plan forecast there are a number where this can be explained by weakdemand, for example, domestic electric appliances, radio and otherelectronic equipment and cotton.    In these industries, with demand falling,productivity could have been increased only by reducing employment morethan output; and thi3 is sometimes neither possible nor desirable, if thefall in demand is believed to be only temporary.12.      In a good many industries, however, the poor performance of productivity cannot be explained by weak demand.    For example, in theimportant field of mechanical engineering, demand has increased atbroadly the Plan rate but the labour force has been increased at twice thePlan rate.    Another example is the motor industry where there v/as asubstantial rise in employment although output last year was held down bythe fall in demand for cars.    The chemical industry also increased itsemployment substantially above the Plan level although output roseconsiderably more slowly than the Plan rate.13.      In the public sector, productivity has grown at less than the Planrate in coal mining, the railv/ays, the postal side of the General PostOffice (GPO) and in electricity.    On the other hand gas output rose faster than the Plan rate, with no increase in employment; and in the telecommunications side of the GPO, output and productivity increased atrates in line with the Plan.14.      Employment by public authorities rose slightly more rapidly in 1965than the average rate envisaged in the National Plan; 94, 000 compared witha forecast of 85, 000.    The additional increases were mainly in theeducation and medical services,    On present policies, the latest forecastssuggest considerably greater increases in employment in centralGovernment, local authorities (especially in education and the health services) than the estimates in the National Plan.-2-
15.      An important factor in achieving the required increase in productivity in future is the need for a rapid rise in industrial investment.The Plan stipulated an average increase of 7 per cent a year in manufacturing investment from 1964-1970.    Investment in manufacturingrose rapidly last year, but there are now signs that despite our new financial incentives some decline is to be expected in 1966 and 1967.    Thisis a disturbing threat to the prospects of longer term growth.Specific Measures16.       The fact that the balance of payments is now the main factorlimiting growth reinforces the need for stepping up our efforts to promoteexports and save imports.    But fundamental to all our problems is theneed to improve productivity more rapidly.    This is essential (along withan effective Prices and Incomes Policy) to improve our competitive position in world markets.    It is also the ultimate determinant of therate of expansion.17.       In addition to the general economic measures designed toencourage industrial expansion and efficiency, we are seeking to raiseproductivity in individual industries through the Economic development committees (EDC), of which there are now twenty, covering two-thirds ofprivate industry.    At the Government^ request, they have so farconcentrated on measures to save imports and increase exports.    Theiremphasis on import saving through competitive manufacture has broughthelpful developments in a variety of ways.    A major development hasbeen to stimulate joint consultation between makers and users of machinery.The latest step has been the establishment of a maker/user group (with government representation) on chemical plant with die job of expanding the production of equipment to meet the investment plans of the chemicals,oil refining and gas industries and export requirements.18.      The impact of the EDCs cannot be measured solely in terms ofheadline-catching action.    Their main job is to identify the opportunities for growth and higher productivity and to make them, and theirrecommended action to seize these opportunities, known to companiesthroughout the industry.    But they have in the course of their work broughtabout specific results, of which the following are some recent examples.The EDCs generally are supporting work on standardisation and reducingthe variety of products with consequent benefits in longer production runs.The most notable success has been the agreement this Spring, on theinitiative of the Electrical Engineering EDC, between the central electricity Generating Board and the cable manufacturers, to reduce the-number of types of high voltage transmission cables from 250 to about 20.Better stock control, which releases capital for new investment and canlower the level of imports, has been pursued by some EDCs and the manual of stock control methods for retailers, published by theDistribution EDC at the end of May, sold 14, 000 copies in the first threeweeks.    The Civil Engineering EDC has recently produced a major report,warmly welcomed by the Minister of Transport, with numerousrecommendations for increasing productivity in road construction,including concentration of major road construction contracts in the handsof fewer teams.    In the course of its work on speeding the movement ofgoods the Movement of Exports EDC has taken a direct initiative in bringing about the establishment of two inland clearance depots as pilot schemesfor helping to reduce port congestion.-3-
s - : E&quot; &apos; *      4,0.919.       In many cases the EDCs have started helping to promoterationalisation in their industries.    In distribution transformers theindustry has been brought to agree to produce its own scheme with the aim of reducing the number of firms from the present thirty to about six.The electric meter manufacturers have also been invited to produce theirown scheme and the Electronics EDG has initiated discussions onrationalisation between the six major firms in its industry.    research into the economies of scale in production has been initiated by the rubber, Food and Wool EDCs.20..     Although the EDCs can analyse the scope for greater efficiencythrough structural changes in their industries and can bring the horses tothe water, they have no power to get them to drink.    It will be theIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation^ (1958-59) function to follow upsuggestions put to it by the EDCs, Government Departments and others,and to carry through practical schemes in co-operation with the industrial interests concerned.    The Bill which will formally establish the 1958-59,and provide it with the necessary financial backing, will be given aSecond Reading before the Summer Recess, and we should make everyeffort to press on to Royal Assent as soon as possible after the Housereassembles.    Meanwhile, I have urged Sir Frank Rearton, the Chairmandesignate of the 1958-59, to get ahead as rapidly as possible with preparatoryv/ork on one or two schemes which might being early benefits to thebalance of payments.    He has agreed to examine the possibilities in the fields of electrical machinery and chemical plant and hopes to have firm proposals ready to be put into effect as soon as the Bill becomes law andthe 1958-59 is able to commit funds,21.       Most of the EDCs work on labour problems so far has been onestimating man-power requirements in the context of the Plan andattempting to identify present or future shortages and suggest action, asthe Mechanical Engineering SDC has recently done in proposing a crashtraining programme of welders.    Other EDCs are arranginginternational and national comparisons of productivity between firms andthe Chemicals EDC is sending a joint trade union/managernent team to theUnited States to establish in detail why man-power usage in Britishchemical plants compares unfavourably with the United States.    This isthe kind of comparison the Government is encouraging through theAnglo/United States productivity study on refrigerators which the electrical Engineering EDC is supporting.    The Paper and Board EDCstudy of four-shift working has made easier its acceptance by trade union members and it now operates in 20 per cent of the industry and isspreading.22.      It is, however, difficult to discuss and act on labour productivityon an industry basis outside wage negotiations.    For this reason, although we hope to get the EDCs to extend and deepen their work on labour productivity, we intend to tackle the problem as well through the national productivity Conference to be held this Autumn.    This is envisaged as thebeginning of a sustained effort to raise productivity, particularly byinitiating practical projects directly involving people on the shop floor.These projects might include extending to further industries Anglo/UnitedStates productivity comparisons, but the major project that we should like-4-
to see is a pilot scheme to establish new plant bargaining committees which would tackle industrial efficiency and restrictive practices indetail in individual factories.    Despite a cool initial response from the confederation of British Industries and the Trades Union Congress, thereis still hope that the Conference might agree on such a scheme.The Implications of Slower Growth23.      If v/e do not achieve the full 25 per cent growth by 1970, someforms of expenditure will inevitably have to be lower than envisaged inthe Plan.24.      Private industrial investment is almost bound to be lower.    the nationalised industries, on the other hand, are continuing to plan toprovide the capacity needed for 25 per cent growth in the economy as awhole.    If in fact that growth is not likely to be achieved, it would bewasteful to continue to base their investment programmes on this assumption.    To do so will increase the squeeze on the private consumer.It is also bad for the finances of the industries themselves.25.      The Treasury and the Department of Economic Affairs have asked the Ministry of Power and the Post Office to consider the effect ofvariations in the rate of grov/th for their industries.    (In Transport the investment programmes are not so clearly related to the general rate ofgrov/th).    The possibility of the Plan rate of growth not being achievedwill obviously be one factor which v/ill have to be taken into account in settling the nationalised industries&apos; investment programmes this Summer.For the moment this will have to be dealt with in an ad hoc way, but assoon a.s possible v/e shall have to decide on fresh planning assumptionsfor these industries going beyond 1970.26.      Whatever marginal cuts may be made in the nationalised industries&apos; programmes up to 1970, and however great a shortfall theremay be on private investment, any failure of output to meet the growthtarget is bound to have implications for private consumption and central and local government expenditure.    K we keep our present public expenditure programmes unchanged, the main brunt will fall on theprivate consumer.    A separate paper will be coming to the Cabinet onthe results of the Public Expenditure Survey.The Review of the Plan27.      We are committed to publishing a review of progress on the Planlater in the year.    Our present timetable also envisages that we should then give industry provisional assumptions about the rate of growth up to1972.    This would be the basis for a further full-scale industrial inquiry,to provide the material for a new plan to be produced in the second half of1967, covering the period to 1972.    We shall need to consider very carefully how the 25 per cent grov/th target to 1970 should be handled inthis context.28. These problems were discussed in a general way at this week&apos;smeeting of the National Economic Development Council and v/e shall be discussing them more fully at the Council&apos;s meeting on 3rd August.-5-
Conclusions29. (a) The prospects of achieving the 25 per cent growth target by 1970have deteriorated since the Plan was published last September.    We mustreview our policies, both in order to strengthen our chances of success and to minimise the consequences of possible failure.(b) We must pursue more vigorously measures to increase exports,save imports and increase productivity in both the private and nationalised industries.(c) This summer&apos;s review of the nationalised industries investment programmes should take into account the reduced likelihood of achieving the 25 per cent growth target by 1970.(d) Proposals for central and local government expenditure up to1970/1 should also be considered against this background.G.
