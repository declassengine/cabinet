HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 93 COPY NO.28th June, 1966CABINETAUTHORISATION OF INCREASE IN LOCAL. AUTHORITYHOUSINGFELOGRAMME IN WALES - HOUSES FOR MINERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for wales the National Coal Board require 2,900 houses in South \Vales for miners transferred to long-life and expanding collieries.    About 1,000were approved in 1965 and earlier.    The re.maining 1,900 are requiredurgently to keep pace with the accelerated closure programme announced at the end of 1, 000 of these must be approved this year and thebalance of 900 next year.    Unless these approvals are given this year there will be a break in the completion of miners1 houses next year.2,      The level of local authority approvals in Wales in 1966 is limitedto 10, 000.    Local authorities are themselves expected to ask for12, 000 to 13, 000 approvals this year - 75 per cent or more of them in industrial South Wales where the housing problem is most acute.   Anumber of authorities must, in any event, therefore, be put off until next year.3.     The demand for miners&apos; houses in Wales represents 10 per cent of the total local authority programme - which is more than double the comparable demand in England.    Local authorities in Wales cannotaccommodate this demand within the programme of 10,000 approvals.4.     The accelerated colliery closure programme has seriouslysapped confidence in the mining industry in South Wales and the presentlabour force of 5 8,000 is dwindling at the rate of 9,5 00 a year.     If thiscontinues - and there is no indication that it will not - collieries nowdeemed to have a long life will be placed in jeopardy.    The provision ofhouses near the long life collieries can play a major part in inducingminers to transfer to these collieries;5.     I seek approval for an increase of 1,000 in the local authority housing programme for 1966.C. H,Welsh Office,S. W. 1.28th June, 1966
