THE HOSPITAL BUILDING programme a Revision of the Hospital Plan for England and WalesIntroduction1. The Hospital Plan which was presented to Parliament in 1962 (Cmnd.1604) established a pattern and standards of provision for the forward planning of the hospital service. Its basic principles remain valid, but medicine hascontinued to advance and an increased rate of growth of the population is nowforeseen. Moreover, it is now clear that many of the schemes shown in theoriginal Plan as expected to start by 1970/71 were inadequately defined andimprecisely costed; consequently, even though greater resources are now being provided for hospital building than ever before, it is clear that the expectationsof the original Plan could not possibly have been fulfilled. The Ministry has there fore undertaken a comprehensive review of the Plan in conjunction withthe Regional Hospital Boards and Boards of Governors of teaching hospitals.2. Starting from the basis of the increased resources now being provided for hospital building, and of a restatement of the pattern and standards of provision to which the forward planning of the hospital service should conform, thepurpose of the review has been to relate the schemes which it is now proposedto carry out as realistically as possible to the resources likely to be available.The distribution of the available resources between Regions has been re-examined in relation to the latest population projections, and the priority of individualschemes reviewed with special attention to the needs of the psychiatric andgeriatric services. The content and cost of each scheme has been assessed asaccurately as is possible at this stage.3. The 1962 Plan explained how the development of the hospital service wascomplementary to the development of services for prevention of illness and forcare in the community; in 1963 and again in 1964, the plans of the localauthorities for development of their health and welfare services were alsopublished. These have recently been revised for the second time. There hasalso been a report from the Sub-Committee of the Central Health ServicesCouncil on the future role of the family doctor, and the Government have con-ducted, with the representatives of the profession, a major recasting of thearrangements for general practice with the object of helping him to fulfil hisrole in a modern Health Service. In reviewing their plans, hospital authorities were particularly asked to ensure that the development of hospital, localauthority and family doctor services was considered as a whole. Much remains to be learned about the interaction of the various services and there is room forexperiments in different forms of collaboration, but it is essential to look athospital development not in isolation, but as part of a nexus of health and welfare services designed to meet the needs of people who will wish, whether insickness or in health, to live whenever possible in their own home.Standards of Provision4. In the 1962 Plan, the following national standards of hospital provisionwere set out as a basis for assessing the probable need for hospital beds and supporting facilities in 1975:
Acute bedsMaternity beds3-3 per 1,000 populationSufficient to fulfil the recommendations of theCommittee on Maternity Services (1959) for anational average of 70 per cent, of confinements totake place in hospital, with a stay of ten days afterconfinement in the normal case and the provisionof some seven ante-natal beds per 1,000 births.(This gave a national average of 0-58 beds per1,000 population in 1975, on the basis of thenational projections of birth rate and populationthen current).Geriatric beds10 per 1,000 persons aged 65 and over.Mental illness beds      Reducing to 1-8 per 1,000 population.Mental subnormality    1-3 per 1,000 population,beds5. The significance of the bed as the unit for measuring the hospital provisionrequired can be exaggerated. The quality of hospital provision can often be greatly improved and the number of in-patients treated can be increased by improving such facilities as pathology laboratories, X-ray departments, operat-ing theatres and physiotherapy departments. Over the last ten years progress has been made in this direction, but substantial opportunities remain for improving the hospital service in this way rather than by providing additionalbeds. Moreover, a trend has already begun, and may be expected to grow, for those needing hospital care who would in the past have become in-patients toreceive treatment as day-patients or out-patients, returning to their own homesafter treatment. The domiciliary health and welfare services are increasinglyable to play their part in this.6. On the other hand, it must be expected that as medicine advances newforms of in-patient treatment will be developed which will make fresh demands in terms of hospital beds: for example, the current development of intermittentdialysis for chronic renal failure.7. Studies to improve our knowledge of hospital needs continue. The mostcomprehensive is a study by the University of Manchester Medical CareResearch Unit of the caseload of the hospitals in the Liverpool Region, taking account of the severity of illness on admission, the extent to which adversesocial conditions affect hospital use, the extent of recurrent need for hospitalcare, and the tempo of work and the efficiency of the hospitals. Other studiesseek to evaluate different forms of care. There are, for example, two studiesbeing carried out by Departments of the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne.One is estimating the use of resources, including hospital beds, under different methods of care for geriatric patients; the other is studying the needs of the elderly for hospital and community services arising from mental infirmity.8. In 1962, it appeared that in those areas where the whole range of services for the elderly inside and outside hospital was well developed, the necessaryhospital provision was being achieved with about 10 geriatric hospital beds per1,000 persons aged 65 and over. No firm evidence to justify a revision of thisratio is at present available, but new factors are emerging. For example, the
growing appreciation of the needs of old people and the fact that the number ofthe very old among the elderly population is gradually increasing will give riseto an increased demand for hospital beds; these factors may however be offsetto some extent by the trend towards more day hospital provision. The latestindications appear to point to a need for slightly higher provision for geriatrics,but firmer evidence is required before conclusions can be drawn. hospital boards and local authorities will together keep the requirements under review,in the light of the principles that have been laid down for the care of the elderly.9. The 1962 Plan accepted the forecast, supported by a statistical inquiry,that an already perceptible decline in the number of hospital beds required formental illness would continue, and that 1-8 beds per 1,000 population could betaken as the probable limit of requirements by about 1975, on the assumptionthat the average length of stay of patients admitted in the years 1954-1956continued to apply. A further inquiry on a comparable basis is in progress but will not be completed for some time. The number of beds in use has continuedto fall and an interim assessment of trends in the long-stay hospital population,and of admission and discharge date, does not suggest that the ratio assumedearlier need be changed at this stage. There remain factors affecting the require-ment which cannot be precisely evaluated.10. Because it was not possible at the time to quantify the effect of the various factors governing the future requirement of beds for mental subnormality, itwas provisionally assumed in Cmnd. 1604 that the national average of 1 -3 bedsthen available per 1,000 population could be taken as a broad guide to future requirements. There is no reason yet either to adopt this estimate as a firmbasis for long-term national planning or to propose some different ratio.Research into the prevalence of subnormality and into other aspects of theproblem continues. Plans for increasing local authority training centres and residential provision for subnormal adults are still in the early stages of fulfilment.In many areas there are still considerable waiting lists for admission to hospital.The right course in the circumstances is to ask Boards to make their own esti-mates of bed needs in the light of the special requirements in each Region.11. As the service develops and studies continue, the time may come (asCmnd. 1604 foresaw) when it is clear that the bed ratios there set out for diff-different categories of patients should be modified. But for the present no sufficient reason to change any of them has appeared. They are, of course, only broadguides which often need to be amended in the light of local study to take account of regional and local variations from the general pattern.Population12. The population projections to which these ratios have to be applied are however substantially higher than those used in the 1962 Plan. Then it was assumed that the population of England and Wales would increase from 46-million in 1961 to 49-2 million in 1975. But the latest estimates show that thepopulation has already reached 47-8 million and is expected to be 54-2 million by 1981. Looking further ahead still, the projection for the year 2001 is 66-3 million: if the ratios set out in paragraph 4 are still to apply, we should, on that basis, need about 70,000 more hospital beds in the year 2001 than we have now.The latest population projections for each Regional Hospital Board area aregiven in the Regional chapters; they take account of decisions on planned
population movements taken up to October 1965. These estimates are subjectto revision from time to time.Pattern of Development13. It is still planned to base the hospital service of the future on a network of district general hospitals providing a wide range of treatment and diagnosticfacilities for in-patients and out-patients, and including units for active psy-chiatric and geriatric treatment. This policy points to the closure of hospitalswhich do not conform to this pattern, and in the interests of economy closureshould take place as soon as possible. But, because of the greater increase of population now expected, it is probable that the closure of many such hospitalswill be delayed longer than had been foreshadowed since they will need to beretained in use, though perhaps for different purposes.14. This pattern of development will afford opportunities for greater partici-pation by general practitioners in hospital work and for linking developments in hospital medicine with work in general practice. Already between a quarter anda third of all general practitioners hold sessional hospital appointments andfurther opportunities will become available for part-time work. In somedistrict general hospitals there are arrangements for family doctors to assume responsibility for the care of suitable patients, and there will be scope forfurther experiments in the use of small hospitals for patients who no longerrequire the full facilities of the district general hospital and can be cared for bytheir own family doctors. Other small hospitals may be developed as out-patient centres.15. The teaching hospitals will play an increasing part as district general hospitals serving the communities around them; in London in particular, some are moving from the centre to suburban districts where improved hospital services are badly needed.The Hospital Building Programme.16. The rate at which hospital building can be undertaken will continue to depend on a number of factors, including the availability of staff qualified to plan and design hospitals, the capacity of the construction industry to deal withthe total load put upon it at any time, and the financial provision which can bemade for hospital building having regard to the strength of the economy and toother claims on national resources.17. Moreover, new hospital buildings generally require more staff andtherefore cost more to run than those they replace, not only because of theincreased scale of basic provision that may now be required, but because, thenew buildings make it possible to provide specialised services that are neededr but could not previously be accommodated. It is estimated that new building at the current rate (about  73 million a year) gives rise to approximately  10million additional running costs each year, which corresponds to an annual increase of about 8,000 hospital staff. Studies of the numbers of staff requiredby different types of hospital, and of the most efficient ways of runninghospitals, are in progress over a wide front; and steps are being taken to trainmore doctors and to recruit and train more nurses and other hospital workers(see paragraphs 26-29 below). But the limitation of available manpower, as
well as of money for running the service, has a bearing on the amount of building work which can be done.18. Any forecast of the capital sums which will be available from year to year must be subject to prevailing economic conditions; but, for the purposesof this review, a somewhat greater provision of resources over the coming years has been assumed in revising the programme than in the original HospitalPlan. Roughly  1,000 million will be spent over the next ten years.19. In considering the distribution of resources between regions, a number of factors have been taken into account. Regard has been paid to the present state of the services provided for patients in each region, to the condition of the hospitals, and to the rate of population growth now forecast. By taking accountof these factors this programme will enable progress to be made both in thecountry as a whole and particularly where the deficiencies are greatest. TheMinistry&apos;s aim is to achieve a common satisfactory standard of service in all parts of the country. Each Regional Hospital Board will be given from year to year its programme in money terms, and will be required to match its capitalexpenditure with these allocations and to adjust its plans accordingly. Variationsfrom the estimated cost of schemes will have to be met by alterations in theprogramme of schemes, not by alterations to the amount of money to be madeavailable.20. Within this framework it is for the Regional Hospital Boards to keep under review the priority of particular schemes within their programmes, incontinued consultation with local interests and with the Ministry. special attention has been and will continue to be paid to psychiatric and geriatricprovision to ensure that it has sufficient priority. For example, though the totalnumber of beds needed for the mentally ill is expected to diminish, the quality of the service can be radically improved by providing treatment at the general hospital and by setting up special units for groups of patients who may needspecial facilities, such as children and adolescents. The demands of medicineare constantly developing, and account must be taken of planned movements of population, for example, through the establishment of further New Towns.It is therefore important that the hospital building programme remain fluid andthat there should be a willingness to adapt it to changes of need, even though this may mean the postponement of some schemes in favour of others.21. The priority of teaching hospital schemes within the programme has been determined and will be kept under review by the Ministry. The needs of the expanding medical schools (see para. 27) have been taken into account. the teaching hospital building programme must be a flexible one for the reasonsmentioned above and also because some changes may be necessary as a resultof the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Medical Education (see para. 27).22. As the Hospital Building Programme has developed, the larger projectshave become more prominent. These big schemes have naturally taken longer to plan and have sometimes had to be deferred in favour of smaller but urgentimprovements. These large schemes are however the essence of the long term development of the hospital service and many are now under construction or about to be started. When the 1962 Hospital Plan was being prepared, only threeschemes costing over  1 million had been completed, costing less than three percent, of the total cost of hospital building completed since 1948. Another 13
schemes were under construction. By 1965 17 schemes of this size had beencompleted and the number in progress was 43, to a total value of  97 million,or well over half the cost of all the hospital building projects then in progress.At the present time only one thirtieth of the total cost of schemes in progress isfor those costing less than  30,000 each. The proportion of total resourcesspent on large schemes continues to increase.23. It is impossible to estimate precisely the cost of a scheme whose precisecontent is still unknown, and it may therefore be misleading to set a startingdate; so much was demonstrated by the history of the original Plan. In the last few years however much experience has been gained and applied in the costing of large hospital building schemes once their content has been settled. More-over, the design and cost guidance material distilled from experience and madeavailable to hospital Boards and their professional advisers has greatly in-creased (see paras. 30-32 and 37-42). In the present review care has been takento cost individual schemes as accurately as is possible at the stage of planningreached, and to draw up realistic building programmes within the capitalallocations likely to be available. Nevertheless, these costings may well be modified as the content of schemes becomes clearer and as their design isworked out.24. It cannot be too often stressed that these are flexible programmes. Theyare flexible because they must accommodate a number of variables: changingpriorities both national and local, variations in cost arising from alterations inthe scope of particular schemes or from such other causes as changes in buildingmethods, variations in money allocations from year to year according to theresources made available to particular regions and to the hospital service as awhole. For example, if more economical planning and design and more efficient building methods come to be adopted, some schemes may start, andfinish, earlier than was originally anticipated. In that event, provided thecountry&apos;s economic strength allowed, and the Government^ social prioritiesdemanded, the allocation of greater resources in total to health, the programmescould be significantly accelerated. There are many imponderables which argueagainst trying to lay down a rigid plan.25. Since therefore both the priority of individual schemes and their costing,and hence their timing, must be kept continuously under review, it would hardly be appropriate to publish in this Paper (and thus give an illusory permanenceto) the detailed programmes as they now stand. The regional chapters show how the service is expected to develop in each region and list the most importantschemes (those expected to cost more than  250,000) at present in progress or expected to start within the four-year period, 1966/67 to 1969/70, but do not attempt to assign starting dates except by indicating those expected to start thisyear. Schemes expected to start after 1969/70 are also listed in two broadclasses of priority.Medical Staff26. Hospital Boards have reviewed their future needs for medical staff inaccordance with the recommendations of the report of 1961 on Medical StaffingStructure in the Hospital Service. The number of consultant staff is currently being increased up to totals approved by the Ministry for the period up to the
end of 1968. In deciding on these totals and in agreeing to increases in thenumbers of junior and intermediate staff, the Ministry has had to take intoaccount the current shortage of doctors.27. There is no means of overcoming this shortage quickly. The number of doctors newly qualifying at British medical schools is, however, increasing andwill continue to do so. In 1966/67 and 1967/68, the University Grants Com-mittee is providing for the start of schemes which will increase the studententry at existing schools by 250 the equivalent of three new medical schools of average size. A new medical school and teaching hospital is being planned atNottingham. Considerable further expansion will however be necessary to overcome existing shortages and improve services. The Royal Commission on medical Education, appointed in 1965, will report on what changes may be needed in the pattern, number, nature or location of medical schools and the content of medical education.Other Staff28. Studies are being made into the extent of the need for other hospitalstaff. The Ministry is studying with hospital authorities the deployment ofnurses in 125 acute hospitals. Other aspects of manpower needs are being examined by the Department of Sociology, University College of South wales and Monmouthshire, by the Department of Applied Social Science, theUniversity of Nottingham and by the Department of Sociology and SocialAdministration, the University of Southampton. To remedy present deficiencesand man new hospital buildings the service will need a continuing increase in numbers of staff. It will also meet growing competition from other forms ofemployment. More effective methods of recruitment are needed: the methodsof recruiting school-leavers to nursing and to other hospital careers, and of attracting back to the service women who have left it on marriage, are beingimproved. The hospital service will have to adjust itself to still greater depen-dence on married women, whether in full-time or in part-time employment.29. Training schemes and the structure of careers in the service will befurther developed. The Salmon Committee has reported on the senior nursingstaff structure, the administrative functions of the senior nursing grades and themethods of preparing staff to occupy them. The National Staff Committeewhich was set up in 1964 for the more effective co-ordination of appointments,training and movement of administrative and clerical staff has produced anumber of reports which have been commended to hospital authorities:complementary Regional Staff Committees were set up in 1965. The training ofa number of other classes of staff is being examined and developed.Hospital Design and ResearchDesign Guidance30. In the early years of the National Health Service there was little oppor-tunity to gain experience of the design of modern hospital buildings. With alarger building programme and more experience of hospital planning, it is nowpossible to take advantage of the unity of the hospital service and to make available for the use of all hospital authorities the distilled experience of thehospital service in Britain and elsewhere.
31. The Ministry&apos;s guidance is made available to hospital authorities andthose who work for them in a number of documents, of which the mostimportant are the Hospital Building Notes and Equipment Notes, which offerguidance on the design and equipment of the various departments of a hospital.Each Building Note is accompanied by a statement of the cost within which a department can be built to the standards in the note. Without reducing thosestandards, the cost allowances have been increased by only 9 per cent, since they were introduced in 1961, although building costs generally have increasedby about 18 per cent, in the same period. This reflects the greater efficiencythat has been achieved in providing hospital buildings of the desired standard.32. The next stage in providing this guidance is to advise on the most efficient ways in which hospital tasks can be carried out in new buildings and how the various hospital departments can most efficiently be combined in wholehospitals. Already experience of how hospital buildings can most satisfactorilydischarge their functions has enabled the Ministry to reduce its detailed study of Boards&apos; plans and so accelerate the planning process.Research Studies33. The hospital building is a framework for the efficient discharge of functionswhose performance may itself be subject to improvement. Almost all research into the efficient operation of hospitals is therefore germane to their design.There are some 200 such studies in hand, including those mentioned in paragraph  and the Ministry is currently providing about  250,000 a year for work of thiskind, in addition to considerable support from the Nuffield Provincial HospitalsTrust, the King Edward&apos;s Hospital Fund and similar bodies.34. Examples of research of this kind are a study by the Social MedicineResearch Unit of the Medical Research Council of the effects of differences in treatment as between patients referred to certain teaching hospitals and tocertain non-teaching hospitals in London. A preliminary study by the Institutefor Operational Research of the methods of serving food to patients; and a study of the effect of length of stay in hospital by the Medical Care ResearchUnit of the Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, the Uni-university of Sheffield.35. The Ministry is itself carrying out studies into various aspects of hospitalactivity, such as the deployment of nurses, progressive patient care, the cost offood, mechanical and electrical aids, the planned maintenance of equipment,and now has a small group of full time research officers.36. Some of the benefits of automation are already apparent in certain hospitaldepartments. The introduction of automatic data processing will not onlysimplify many existing tasks but will provide valuable information for manage-ment and will assist planners in the design of new hospital buildings.Design Standardisation37. Hospital building is complex and whatever economies may be achievedmany of its essentials will remain expensive. Much more can be done, however,short of rigid uniformity, to reduce unnecessary variety and so lessen the workof design. The Ministry and the Hospital Boards, in co-operation with theScottish Home and Health Department and the Ministry of Health and social services in Northern Ireland, are working on the application to hospital design
and construction of the principles of industrialised building. All hospitaldesign is now linked to the national system of preferred dimensions and within this system study groups are drawing up specifications for a range of building and engineering components, to encourage longer production runs and lower prices. Limited ranges of doors, storage units, window assemblies, partitionsand directional signs have already been provided, with a saving of time to thedesigner, improvement of design and reduction of cost. It is hoped in due course to cover about 80 per cent, of hospital building components in this way.The National Health Service has had the willing co-operation of architects,engineers and quantity surveyors and of manufacturers.38. It may be advantageous to carry standardisation further to enable theservice to get the utmost value from its resources, though it must never beallowed to prevent experiment or adaptability to changing needs. The possi-bility of designing standard departments of hospitals for general use is nowbeing examined. The designs for such standard departments would be modifiedfrom time to time in the light of experience.39. Work is also being done to improve and rationalise the ranges of looseequipment. Working groups have been set up to study various kinds of supplies and equipment and to produce guidance on specifications and purchasingmethods. These studies should lead to the provision of items more appropriate to hospitals&apos; requirements, a reduction in the variety of types purchased and better value for money. Although the items considered so far are mainly non-medical, for example, textiles and furniture, a start has been made in the moredifficult field of medical equipment. The Ministry&apos;s scientific and technical staff has been expanded and is now increasingly engaged in the development and evaluation of medical equipment: more than 50 projects are currently beingcentrally financed and supervised. A study is being made of the methods bywhich the hospital service might best obtain the wide range of medical and domestic goods which it requires.40. An experiment is also being undertaken to evaluate the contribution which can be made to hospital building by proprietary building &quot;systems&quot;.Under this, seven major contractors have been asked to construct hospitalbuildings (mainly maternity units) using their own systems adapted to thenational system of preferred dimensions. It is hoped from this experiment to discover how easily the systems can be adapted to a common dimensionalpattern, and to the particular context of hospital building.41. The Ministry is also as part of these activities undertaking, in co-operationwith Regional Hospital Boards, three major building development schemes,including a complete district general hospital at Greenwich.42. Two experimental schemes of special interest are those at Eastburn(Yorks.) and at Crewe which, taking advantage of larger than average sites,promise to provide cheaper accommodation than has previously been possible.Conclusion43. The National Health Service inherited too many old and out-of-datehospitals. The Governments firm intention is to provide modern hospitals forthe entire country. Good progress is now being made towards this end. How
soon it can be achieved depends, more than anything, on the progress of thenational economy.44. The particular aim of this review has been to bring greater realism to hospital planning. The Government will give to hospital building as large ashare of resources as the country can afford. But at all times the main problem will be how to get the best possible value from the resources provided. Thismeans increasing acceptance of techniques and standards fitting the needs of anational service, not solely designed for particular hospitals. The Service mustdevelop as a whole. The planning that is summarised in this Command paper has at all times had that end in view.
REGIONAL PROGRAMMES
THE NEWCASTLE HOSPITAL region emphasis of the programme the Newcastle Hospital Region has a population of about 3-09 million,which is expected to increase to 3-36 million by 1981. The elderly form asubstantial proportion of this increase, and indeed the number of people aged65 and over in the region, at present 343,000, is expected to increase by 30%to 446,000 in 1981.The major problems of the region are:(i) to provide for this increased population and in particular for the heavy demands on hospital services likely to be made by the substantial increase in the numbers of the elderly;(ii) the need for replacing or improving many existing hospitals;(iii) the general need, apart from the increase in population, for moregeriatric and psychiatric services.The general basis of the programme is one of making progress on the pro-vision of district general hospital facilities throughout the region, and of supplementing this progress by minor schemes (under  100,000) to increasegeriatric and psychiatric provision and to improve existing facilities. Moreaccommodation for the mentally subnormal is also being provided. the regional Board has had to keep in mind the practical and economic difficultieswhich long intervals between phases of development can create and this factor has influenced the timing of the start and phasing of some of the majorredevelopments.Pattern of development the intended pattern of development of the hospital services in the regionis now as follows:Newcastle area the intention is to concentrate the general hospital services of the area in three hospitals: a new hospital at Freeman Road, Newcastle; the teachinghospital, concentrated in a redeveloped Royal Victoria Infirmary; and aredevelopment of Newcastle General Hospital.St. Nicholas mental illness hospital, Newcastle, will serve the Newcastle,Gateshead, and N.W. Durham areas.Gateshead area the intention is to concentrate the general hospital services for this area at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Gateshead.South Shields area the intention is to concentrate the general services for this area at a newhospital on the site of South Shields General Hospital. The completionof the first two phases of this development will release beds elsewhere inthe area for geriatric use.
South East Northumberland, Wansbeck, Berwick, and Alnwick areas the long term intention is to concentrate the general hospital services inSouth East Northumberland at a completely new hospital, possibly atRake Lane, Tynemouth; in the Berwick area, by further development atBerwick Infirmary, and in the Alnwick area by development of AlnwickInfirmary.In the Wansbeck area, it is intended to complete the development ofAshington Hospital. In the long-term it will probably also be necessary,in order to meet the full needs of the area, to build a new district general hospital in addition to Ashington Hospital. In the meantime variousinterim schemes are in mind to help meet the serious shortage of geriatricbeds.It is intended to complete the development of Northgate and DistrictHospital for the mentally subnormal. This will be an 800-bed hospitalwith full supporting facilities and will serve the Wansbeck, Newcastle,Berwick, Alnwick and South East Northumberland areas.St. Mary&apos;s mental illness hospital, Stannington, and St. George&apos;s mental illness hospital, Morpeth, will serve the South East Northumberland,Wansbeck, Berwick, Alnwick, and Hexham areas.Hexham area the long-term intention is to develop Hexham General Hospital into themain district hospital.The development of Prudhoe Hospital for the mentally subnormal hasrecently been completed. This hospital will serve the Hexham, Newcastle,Gateshead, South Shields, N.W. Durham, Sunderland, and Durham areas.North West Durham, South West Durham, and Durham areas the intention is to concentrate the general hospital services for the N.W.Durham area by redeveloping Shotley Bridge General Hospital. Theintention in the S.W. Durham area is to concentrate the general hospital services by redeveloping Bishop Auckland General Hospital. The long-term intention in the Durham area is to build a district general hospital atDurham to serve the general hospital needs. In the meantime various minorschemes to improve diagnostic and geriatric accommodation and the accident service are in mind. It is intended to develop Earls House hospitality-tal, Durham, for the mentally subnormal. This hospital will serve theDurham, Sunderland, Hartlepools and North Tees areas.Sunderland areaIt is difficult to forecast with any accuracy the size of the population whichwill in future need to be served in this area, which includes the new town of washington, but in the long term it is likely that three or four district general hospitals will be needed together with a new hospital for the mentally subnormal. It is intended to begin with the redevelopment ofRyhope General Hospital. It will probably also be necessary to carry out some interim development elsewhere with a view to improving supporting services in the area.
Cherry Knowle Hospital, Ryhope, for the mentally ill will serve theSunderland and South Shields areas.North Tees-side, South Tees-side and the Hartlepools areas the general hospital services in the North Tees-side area will be con-centrated at the new North Tees General Hospital, Stockton. The com-pletion of the first two phases of this development will release beds else wherein the area for geriatric patients.Winterton mental illness hospital will serve the North Tees-side, Hartle-pools, S.W. Durham, Durham, Darlington, and Northallerton areas. It isintended to carry out improvements to the hospital, including upgradingof the in-patient accommodation which will permit better grouping of patients.The long-term intention in the South Tees-side area is to concentrate thegeneral hospital services for the area in three new hospitals, the first ofwhich will be built on part of the St. Luke&apos;s Hospital site. A new hospitalfor the mentally subnormal will also be required.

THE LEEDS HOSPITAL region emphasis of the programme the Leeds Hospital Region has a population of about 3-19 million. This isexpected to increase to about 3-42 million by 1981. The elderly form a substantial proportion of this increase; the number of people aged 65 and over in the region,at present 375,000, is expected to increase by about 35 % to 519,000 in 1981.The main consideration in formulating a hospital programme for the regionis not so much the need to make provision for the relatively small increase in total population as the need to replace out-dated accommodation, to continueto rationalise the pattern of hospital services throughout the region and toreduce the present unevenness in the level and standard of facilities in different areas. Thus, although the programme includes the building of several newhospitals and the substantial redevelopment of others the aim is not any signifi-cant overall expansion in the number of beds (except for maternity beds) butthe development of a more rational pattern that will allow something like theexisting number of beds to be better situated, more effectively used and supportedby improved diagnostic and treatment facilities. A deficiency in the present standard of these supporting facilities, particularly in out-patient and accidentdepartments, is a common feature in many parts of the region and for thisreason a good deal of the programme consists of the development of suchdepartments. This type of development will generally be undertaken in thefirst phase of the building of new hospitals or of the redevelopment of existinghospitals; the bulk of ward accommodation, maternity units, acute and mediumstay psychiatric units, geriatric admission units and supporting facilities willgenerally be built in the later phases of these major developments.The Regional Board have, however, maintained a place in the early partof the programme for the start of several major geriatric and psychiatricdevelopments.Acute and medium stay units will also be provided at the larger mental illnesshospitals in the region where long stay beds may be expected to be reduced in number.    .-,..The programme also makes provision for the commencement of redevelop-ment of Leeds General Infirmary which, as the teaching hospital for the region,will have to provide for an increased output from the Leeds Umversity medical and Dental Schools. Some teaching facilities will also be provided at St.James&apos;s Hospital, Leeds.
Pattern of development the pattern of development of the hospital services in the region is now expected to be as follows:Leeds and Otley area the services of the area will centre ultimately on St. James&apos;s Hospital andLeeds General Infirmary, both of which are to be rebuilt on their existingsites, and in the meantime Otley General Hospital will also continue toserve the Wharfedale area. Cookridge Hospital will be developed to provide additional geriatric beds. Psychiatric services in the area will be provided at St. James&apos;s Hospital and at High Royds and Stanley Royd Hospitals.Mental subnormality services for the area will continue to be provided atMeanwood Park Hospital which will also serve other areas in the region.Hull and East Riding areaWhen the new 542-bed hospital in Hull is completed this year it will joinHull Royal Infirmary (Sutton), Kingston General Hospital, WestwoodHospital, Beverley and Castle Hill Hospital, Cottingham in providingdistrict general hospital services for the area. Psychiatric services in thearea will be largely centred on De la Pole Hospital and Broadgate Hospital(mental illness) and Brandesburton Hall (mental subnormality); these services will be shared by other areas.Scarborough, Bridlington, Malton and Whltby area the services of the area will be centred at Scarborough General Hospital,which is to be redeveloped on its present site, and new hospitals to be built at Bridlington and Whitby. Acute psychiatric beds will be provided in the later stages of the redevelopment of Scarborough General but for theremainder of its psychiatric services the area will continue to look towardsthe hospitals in the East Riding and York areas.York and Selby area the services of the area will be centred on a new district general hospitalto be built on a site adjacent to Bootham Park Hospital. Later stages ofthis development will include the provision of geriatric admission beds and short-stay psychiatric beds. Longer stay geriatric beds will be found at theCity Hospital and in new building on an adjacent site. Apart from acutepsychiatric beds ultimately to be provided at the new hospital, mental illness services for the area will largely be centred on Clifton and BoothamPark Hospitals. Mental subnormality services will be centred on Clay-penny, Whixley and Rawcliffe Hall Hospitals where additional beds areto be provided. All these psychiatric hospitals will also continue to serveother areas.Harrogate and Ripon area the services of the area will be centred on a new district general hospitalto be built at Harrogate. Later stages of this development will includeacute psychiatric beds but for the remainder of its psychiatric services thearea will continue to look towards the York area.
Bradford, Bingley, Keighley, Skipton and Ilkley area the services for the major part of the area&apos;s population will be centred atBradford Royal Infirmary and a new district general hospital in Bradford.The Keighley, Skipton area will be served by a new district general hospitalat Eastburn. Bierley Hall Hospital will be developed to provide newgeriatric accommodation. Acute psychiatric beds will be provided as partof the new hospitals in Bradford and Eastburn and the remaining mental illness services will continue to be provided for this and other areas of the region at Scalebor Park, Lynfield Mount and High Royds Hospitals, all of which are being, or are to be expanded, or modernised. WestwoodHospital will continue to provided mental subnormality services for this and other areas.Halifax area the services of the area will ultimately be concentrated at a new district general hospital on the site of the present Halifax General Hospital.Apart from short-stay beds which will be associated with the new hospital,geriatric and psychiatric accommodation will be provided by developmentof Northowram Hospital. Mental subnormality services will ultimately be housed in new accommodation on a site to be selected in the area.Huddersfield area the services of the area will be centred at the new 508-bed hospital atLindley, Huddersfield, which will be brought into commission this yearand at St. Luke&apos;s Hospital where major redevelopment was completed in1965. St. Luke&apos;s and Storthes Hall Hospitals will together provide a comprehensive mental illness service for the area, the latter hospital alsocontinuing to serve other areas. Mental subnormality services will continueto be provided by facilities in neighbouring areas but ultimately will beprovided by new building in Huddersfield on a site to be selected.Wakefield, Dewsbury, Batley and Mtrfield area the services of the area will ultimately be centred at new district general hospitals to be built at Dewsbury and Wakefield, the latter in effect com-prising the redevelopment of Pinderfields General Hospital. Apart fromshort-stay beds ultimately to be associated with the new hospital in Dews-bury, psychiatric provision for the area will be centred at Stanley RoydHospital (mental illness) and a new hospital for the mentally subnormal atWakefield. This provision will be shared by other areas.Pontefract, Castleford, Goole and Howden area the services of the area will ultimately be centred at Pontefract general hospital with additional facilities at Castleford which, together with theBartholomew Hospital, Goole, will satisfy the needs of the area. Apartfrom the acute psychiatric services to be included in this complex the area will continue to look to its neighbouring areas for mental illness andmental subnormality services.

THE SHEFFIELD HOSPITAL region emphasis of the programme the Sheffield Hospital Region has a population of about 4-55 million.This is expected to increase to 5-19 million in 1981. Within these totals, thenumber of persons aged 65 and over is expected to increase from 516,000 nowto 658,000 in 1981, i.e. by more than one quarter.Most of the hospitals in the region are old and require to be redeveloped to modern standards or replaced. There is a particular shortage of maternitybeds: a substantial programme for providing large modern maternity units inthe major towns is already under way. Generally the programme aims at the progressive redevelopment of the major general hospitals as district general hospitals providing a comprehensive range of services, including where appro-priate facilities for psychiatric and geriatric treatment. Accident and emergencyunits will be provided at selected district general hospitals. A number ofexisting geriatric hospitals will be upgraded and enlarged, and further provisionfor the increasing number of elderly will be made by converting some hospitalsat present used for other purposes. A number of new hospitals for the mentallysubnormal are now being planned.The largest projects of all are the new teaching hospitals at Sheffield, onwhich work has already started, and at Nottingham, on which planning is being pressed forward. Together these two projects will ultimately provide morethan 2,000 new beds and the annual number of medical students proceeding toclinical training in the region will be trebled.Pattern of development the intended pattern of development of the hospital services in the region isnow expected to be as follows: Sheffield area the general hospital services of this area will eventually be based on theCity General Hospital, which will be developed as a district general hospital; the Hallamshire Hospital (the new main teaching hospital);and a new district general hospital which will be built at Norton, in thesouth of Sheffield.

Thepopulation of the Mexborough area is thought to justify a separate district
general hospital, but it is not yet clear where this will be provided. Extrageriatric beds will be provided at Badsley Moor Lane Hospital; andWathwood Hospital will eventually be developed to accommodate longstay psychiatric patients.

THE EAST ANGLIAN HOSPITAL region emphasis of the programme the East Anglian Hospital Region has a population of about 1,620,000.This is expected to increase to 1,880,000 by 1981. One of the major problems ofthe region is to provide for this increased population, particularly in Ipswichand Peterborough and in the Cambridge and South West area.There is a general shortage of acute and maternity beds, and many hospitalsare in old buildings and deficient in out-patient and diagnostic facilities. Greatimportance is attached to remedying these deficiencies.The programme includes substantial expenditure on redeveloping Adden-brooke&apos;s Hospital which will continue as a teaching hospital for the region andwill provide a district service for Cambridge and the surrounding area.Numerically the region is well off for geriatric and mental illness beds andthe Regional Board&apos;s aim is to continue the policy of upgrading, to provideacute units in district general hospitals as they are built and day hospitals where possible. The Board&apos;s programme pays due regard to the need for more mentalsubnormality beds.Pattern of development the pattern of development of the hospital services in the region is now expected to be as follows:Cambridge and South West area the services for the area will centre on Addenbrooke&apos;s Hospital which isbeing redeveloped on a new site.Future developments will include a new district hospital for Huntingdon(where interim improvements are proposed) and redevelopment of theTower Hospital, Ely, and Saffron Walden General Hospital. Improvementsat these hospitals will supplement the general services and geriatric pro-vision for the area. Chesterton Hospital, Cambridge is to be improved andwill continue as a geriatric hospital. Fulbourn Hospital for mental illnessis currently being upgraded and there are further plans to reorganise and extend facilities there. The first phases of the new Ida Darwin Hospital forthe mentally subnormal are under construction at Fulbourn.West Suffolk area the needs of this area will be met by a district general hospital at Bury St.Edmunds which will include beds for geriatrics and the mentally ill. Majorredevelopment is planned at the Risbridge Home, Kedington and at theJane Walker Hospital, Nayland to increase the region&apos;s facilities formentally subnormal patients.Ipswich and East Suffolk area the services for this area will be developed at two new district general hospitals for Ipswich which will include geriatric and mental illness beds.Work on a new geriatric unit is currently in progress at the Heath RoadWing of the Ipswich and East Suffolk Hospital. Major upgrading is also in
progress at Stow Lodge Hospital which will continue to form part of thegeriatric service for the area. St. clement&apos;s Hospital, Ipswich will continueto provide mental illness beds for the area.Norwich and Cromer area the phased redevelopment of the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital willprovide the first district general hospital for the area. A second one will eventually be needed. The area&apos;s geriatric needs will be met at the seconddistrict general hospital and at Wayland Hospital, Attleborough and elsewhere. Hellesdon Hospital for mental illness will continue to serve this area and the Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft area.Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft areas new district general hospital is proposed eventually to meet the needs ofthis area, and will include geriatric and mental illness beds. Work on anew maternity unit at Northgate Hospital is due to start later this year andother interim improvements at Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft are proposed.King&apos;s Lynn and Wisbech area the needs of this area are to be met mainly by a new district general hospitalat King&apos;s Lynn which will include geriatric and mental illness beds. Interimimprovements are being undertaken at Wisbech.Peterborough and Stamford AreaPeterborough Memorial Hospital is at present being redeveloped to providea district general hospital for the area. It is planned eventually to build asecond district general hospital at Peterborough and to redevelop theStamford and Rutland Hospital, both of which will include geriatric beds.Improved facilities will also be provided at the County Hospital, Dodding-ton.The later developments at Peterborough will include mental illness provi-sion and there will also be a new hospital for mental subnormality to meetregional needs.Major building schemes (New Hospitals and building schemes expected [to costmore than  250,000).Already in progressCambridge new regional blood transfusion service headquarters.Fulbourn Hospital improvements to engineering services.Ida Darwin Hospital new mental subnormality hospital, phase I and staff housing.Ipswich and East Suffolk Hospital (Heath Road Wing) geriatric unit.Norfolk and Norwich Hospital boiler-house, mortuary, workshops andnew maternity unit.Peterborough Memorial Hospital redevelopment, phase II, including mainward block, out-patient and accident departments.Schemes which it is hoped to start within the period up to 1969/70Cambridge new Addenbrooke&apos;s Hospital, phase II (expected to start thisyear).

THE NORTH WEST METROPOLITANHOSPITAL region emphasis of the programme the North West Metropolitan Hospital Region has a population of about 4-million. This is expected to increase to 4-9 million in 1981. The problems inthe region are those of renewal where necessary and expansion to provide forthis increased population and the increases that have already taken placetogether with shifts of population within the region. As an example, in theStevenage, Bracknell and Hemel Hempstead areas the creation of new townsmakes the provision of additional hospital facilities a matter of more than usualurgency.A new hospital is needed to replace the King Edward Memorial Hospital,Ealing, which is under very heavy pressure and in need of improved facilities;and a new hospital (in association with the Medical Research Council&apos;s ClinicalResearch Centre) is being built at Northwick Park to serve parts of the adjoiningLondon Boroughs of Brent and Harrow. Elsewhere the emphasis will be onredeveloping and expanding existing hospitals by stages to provide a districtservice to match the needs of the areas dependent on them. Apart from theincrease in beds, the Board propose to continue improving diagnostic and treatment facilities, including out-patient, accident and emergency departments,operating theatres and pathological services where deficiencies exist.The programme also includes substantial expenditure on teaching hospitals,in particular a completely new Royal Free Hospital and, later, a start to the rebuilding of St. Mary&apos;s Hospital. The teaching hospital projects are designedprimarily to provide up-to-date facilities for treatment of patients, but will also make more extensive provision for the clinical work of the associated medical schools and specialist postgraduate institutes.In the field of psychiatry, psychiatric units for mental illness are proposed at anumber of district general hospitals. This will enable these hospitals to providebeds and day hospital facilities for the mentally ill as an integral part of thegeneral hospital service. A regional unit is proposed for adolescent psychoticsand another for the long-stay needs of psychopaths complementary to the pioneer diagnostic and treatment centre for psychopaths now building at WestHendon. A substantial number of additional beds for mental subnormality isalso proposed. Additional accommodation will be provided at hospitals for the mentally ill and for the mentally subnormal to meet the considerable develop-ment which is taking place in all forms of occupational therapy.Additional geriatric beds are intended which will be added to as opportunity offers by re-allocation from other specialities.Provision of much needed residential accommodation, improvement of engineering services and the extension of hospital laundry facilities are also proposed.
Pattern of development the pattern of development of the hospital services in the region is now expected to be as follows: Inner London AreaThis is the area served mainly by the Paddington and North London HospitalGroups and by the teaching hospitals situated within the region, notably fourlarge undergraduate hospitals (Royal Free, University College, Middlesex and at . Mary&apos;s, Paddington). There are also a number of postgraduate hospitals(including Hammersmith). Rebuilding of Charing Cross Hospital at Fulhamwill take the main hospital now at Agar Street, W.C. 2, outside the regional boundary (see p.44) and the first phase of the Chelsea postgraduate medical Centre (see p.44) will provide accommodation to take St. John&apos;hospital for Diseases of the Skin, St. Mark&apos;s Hospital for Diseases of theRectum and Colon, and the St. Peter&apos;s, St. Paul&apos;s and St. Philip&apos;s group of hospitals (urology) all of which are presently situated within the region.District general hospital services within this area will be provided by the teaching hospitals and by the Paddington General, Royal Northern,Whittington, and St. Charles&apos; Hospitals. The new Royal Free Hospital atLawn Road and the opportunity for providing more closely integratedfacilities in Paddington on the rebuilding of St. Mary&apos;s Hospital will makeimportant contributions to improved local services.The area looks to Friern Hospital and to Horton and Springfield Hospitals(in the South West Metropolitan Region) for the treatment of mentally illpatients and to Leavesden and Harperbury Hospitals for beds for the mentally subnormal. It is hoped in the long-term to provide within the region for the population of this area at present served by Horton andSpringfield Hospitals. The Tavistock Clinic, for out-patients only, is beingrebuilt at Hampstead and is expected also to house the Child GuidanceTraining Centre and the Tavistock Institute.North and Central Middlesex area the services of the area will centre on district general hospitals to beprovided by the redevelopment of Edgware General Hospital and MountVernon Hospital, the building of the new hospital and clinical researchcentre (in association with the Medical Research Council) at NorthwickPark, and the further development of the Central Middlesex and WillesdenGeneral Hospitals.The area will look to Napsbury, Shenley, Hill End and St. Bernard&apos;sHospitals and to Springfield Hospital for the treatment of mentally illpatients. It looks to Harperbury, Leavesden and Cell Barnes Hospitalsfor beds for the mentally subnormal. It is hoped in the long-term toprovide within the region for the population of this area at present served by Springfield Hospital. A psychiatric unit for mental illness is to beincluded in the new Northwick Park Hospital.South West Middlesex area the services of the area will centre on district general hospitals to beprovided by the development of West Middlesex, Ashford and Hillingdon
Hospitals on their present sites and the building of a new hospital on a site at Southall to replace the existing King Edward Memorial Hospital,Ealing.The area will look to St. Bernard&apos;s Hospital and to Springfield Hospitalfor the treatment of mentally ill patients. For mentally subnormal patientsit is served partly by Leavesden Hospital, and partly by Normansfieldwhich it is proposed to extend and which is within the area. In the long termit is hoped to provide within the region for the population of this area atpresent served by Springfield Hospital.Barnet, Mid- and West Hertfordshire AreaMost of the acute work for the Barnet area will be concentrated at BarnetGeneral Hospital. St Alban&apos;s City Hospital will continue as a district general hospital. With the recent addition of a psychiatric unit, the newQueen Elizabeth II Hospital, Welwyn, now provides a full district general hospital service. West Herts, and St. Paul&apos;s Hospitals will continue toprovide a district general hospital service which will ultimately be con-centrated on a new site and Shrodells Hospital, Watford, is in course ofredevelopment as a district general hospital by the provision of maternity and psychiatric services.The area will look to Hill End and Napsbury Hospitals, in addition to thenew unit at the Queen Elizabeth II Hospital, for the treatment of mentally ill patients, and to Harperbury and Cell Barnes Hospitals for beds for the mentally subnormal. New psychiatric units for mental illness are proposed at Barnet and Shrodells Hospitals.Luton and Hitchin area the services of the area will centre on a new district general hospital to be built near Stevenage, on the redeveloped Luton and Dunstable hospital and on expanded maternity services at the Luton Maternity Hospital whichis adjacent to the Luton and Dunstable Hospital. A second district general hospital is proposed later in the Luton area.The area looks to Fairfield Hospital for the treatment of mentally ill patients and to Bromham and Cell Barnes Hospitals for beds for the mentallysubnormal. The new hospital to be built near Stevenage will include apsychiatric unit for the mentally ill, and a similar unit will be provided atLuton and Dunstable Hospital.Bedfordshire area the services of the area will ultimately centre on a district general hospitalon the Bedford General Hospital (South Wing) site where all general hospital&apos;services will be concentrated.The area looks to Fairfield Hospital for the treatment of mentally illpatients and to Bromham Hospital for beds for the mentally subnormal.A^psychiatric unit for mental illness is proposed at Bedford general hospital.
Windsor, Slough and Maidenhead Area.The services of the area will at least in the short term centre on district general hospitals to be provided by the redevelopment of King EdwardVII (Windsor) and Heatherwood (Ascot) Hospitals and by further develop-ment of the new hospital recently built at Wexham Park, Slough. Maiden-head Hospital will remain a centre for out-patient work and might evencome to rival Windsor as a hospital centre. A site has been earmarked atBracknell for hospital development.The area looks to St. Bernard&apos;s Hospital for the treatment of mentally illpatients and to Church Hill House and Leavesden Hospitals for beds forthe mentally subnormal. Church Hill House Hospital will be extended.

THE NORTH EAST METROPOLITANHOSPITAL region emphasis of the programme the North East Metropolitan Hospital Region has a population of about 3 -4 million. This is expected to increase to 3*8 million in 1981.The region has to provide not only for a population increase of about 12 percent, but also for a shift in the balance of population caused by migration from east London to the new towns of Harlow and Basildon and to other long-established but growing communities such as Colchester. New district hospitalsare required at both Basildon and Colchester. Elsewhere the programme will be one of rebuilding existing hospitals. The Regional Board will continue toimprove diagnostic and treatment facilities so that greater use can be made ofexisting beds and with the improved facilities more patients can be treated satis-factorily without their becoming in-patients. Wherever possible the Board are proceeding accordingly, but in some areas, the rapid growth of communitieshas outstripped hospital provision to the extent that the provision of new bedsas well as improved facilities is the only feasible course. A programme forthe development of accident and emergency departments is under considerationby the Board.The Board will continue to increase their provision for the mentally sub-normal and are devoting substantial sums to the upgrading of their psychiatrichospitals. They are also providing and planning additional facilities for short and medium stay psychiatric patients at district general hospitals.The population aged 65 and over is expected to increase from 437,000 in1965 to about 483,000 in 1981. In addition to the provision of geriatric units in district general hospitals the Board intend to upgrade a number of hospitalsdevoted to the geriatric services.Pattern of developmentInner London (City, London Boroughs of Hackney and Tower Hamlets).&apos;    The population of this area has declined since the war (although this trendmay well be halted in the 1970&apos;s) and consequently the number of acutebeds in relation to the population is very much above the norm.Although there is a case for retaining some extra beds in the area becauseof social conditions and on account of the relief given to peripheral hos-hospitals under pressure, it should be possible to rationalise the hospital* services in the area in conjunction with the two general teaching hospitals,St. Bartholomew^ and The London Hospitals. Discussions are takingplace between the hospital and University authorities concerned about thefuture relationship of these two hospitals with others nearby in providing a full district service and in making teaching facilities available for increasedintakes of students at the two medical colleges.So far as can be seen, the district service for this area will eventually beprovided mainly by new district general hospitals at Poplar and on the site of St. Leonard&apos;s, the Hackney, Bethnal Green and Mile End and
London Jewish Hospitals in addition to St. Bartholomew^ and The LondonHospitals.The Board are providing a psychiatric unit of 90 beds at Hackney Hospitalwhich, with the similar unit at St. clement&apos;s Hospital, will reduce the dependence of this area on Long Grove Hospital, Epsom, in the SouthWest Metropolitan Region. Improvements will be carried out at St.Matthew&apos;s Hospital, N.1 to provide a better service for geriatric patients.Outer London (North) (Enfield London Borough: part of Haringey LondonBorough: Cheshunt U.D.).The changes in the boundaries of Regional Hospital Boards on 1st April,1965 following the re-organization of London government resulted in theNorth East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board assuming responsibilityfor the provision of hospital services for virtually the whole of the LondonBorough of Enfield and in the transfer to that Board of Highlands Hospital.This hospital has of course been brought within the Board&apos;s general plans for the area but the main district general hospitals will be at Chase Farm,Enfield; North Middlesex, Edmonton; and on the site of St. Ann&apos;s,Tottenham.Facilities at St. Michael&apos;s Hospital, Enfield, which caters for the elderly,will be improved.Outer London (Central) (London Boroughs of Waltham Forest, Newham,Redbridge (western part): Chigwell U.D.).New district general hospitals will eventually be built at Woodford Greenand Forest Gate. These, together with Whipps Cross and East HamMemorial Hospital, will provide the main district service for the area1.Psychiatric services will continue to be provided at Claybury and Good-mayes Hospitals. An adolescent unit will shortly be built at GoodmayesHospital.Improved facilities for geriatric patients will be provided at LangthorneHospital, Leytonstone.Outer London (East) (London Boroughs of Barking, Havering, Redbridge(part): Brentwood U.D.).    .District hospitals for the area are Barking, King George (Ilford), Oldchurch,Rush Green and Harold Wood Hospitals and these will continue to be developed.Warley Hospital for mental illness will continue to provide psychiatricservices. South Ockendon Hospital will continue to serve as one of the region&apos;s main hospitals for the mentally sub-normal.West Essex and Hertford.The principal general hospitals for the area are Princess Alexandra, Harlow;St. Margaret&apos;s, Epping; Herts and Essex, Bishop&apos;s Stortford; and HertfordCounty Hospital. Work on the psychiatric unit at Princess AlexandraHospital is proceeding and will virtually complete the new hospital as planned. Any major expansion of Harlow new town would however giverise to the need to consider extending the hospital. The question Of hospitalprovision for the Bishop&apos;s Stortford area awaits a decision on the future*i   of the airport at Stansted and the possible siting of a new town there.
Mid Essex.The services in this area will eventually centre on the new district general hospital to be built on the site of Broomfield Hospital. In the meantimeimprovements to operating theatres and other services at Chelmsford andEssex and St. John&apos;s Hospitals are to be carried out.North East Essex.The main hospital facilities in the area will be provided by a new district general hospital to be built at Colchester, supplemented by increased\ provision at Clacton.Royal Eastern Counties Hospital, Colchester will continue to be one ofthe main centres of the Region for the mentally sub-normal and SeverallsHospital will continue as one of the Region&apos;s main psychiatric hospitals.Heath Hospital, Tendring, which provides geriatric services will be im-proved.South East Essex.The district general hospitals for the area will be at Basildon, Orsett,Southend-on-Sea and Rochford. Psychiatric services will continue to beprovided for parts of this and surrounding areas by Runwell Hospital andthe short-stay unit at Rochford Hospital.Major building schemes (New hospitals and building schemes expected to costmore than  250.000).Already in progressBarking major developments at Barking Hospital.Epping new out-patient/accident centre and boiler plant at St. MargarefsHospital.Harlow psychiatric unit at Princess Alexandra Hospital.The London Hospital nurse training school.Orsett major developments at Orsett Hospital.Schemes which it is hoped to start within the period up to 1969170Basildon phase I of a new district general hospital.Brentwood new central heating plant at Warley Hospital (expected to start this year).Edmonton a new maternity unit and clinical block at North MiddlesexHospital (expected to start this year).Enfield a new maternity unit and clinical block at Chase Farm Hospital.Harold Wood new maternity unit and boiler plant at Harold WoodHospital (expected to start this year).The London Hospital phase I of new clinical block.Orsett a further ward block, additional facilities and staff accommodation at Orsett Hospital.Romford a new maternity unit at Rush Green Hospital (expected to start this year).&quot;\St. Bartholomew^ Hospital new pathology department (expected to start1 this year).

THE SOUTH EAST METROPOLITAN HOSPITALREGIONEmphasis of the programme the South East Metropolitan Hospital Region has a population of about 3-46million. This is expected to increase to 3-83 million in 1981. One of the major problems of the, region is to provide for this increased population, particularlyin East and Central Kent and East Sussex; the provision of further hospitalfacilities is a matter of some urgency in the expanding areas of Ashford, Canter-bury, Maidstone, Eastbourne, and Brighton. The main emphasis in the RegionalBoard&apos;s programme is on the redevelopment of existing hospitals, with earlyprovision of new outpatient, accident, and maternity departments.The Board&apos;s programme provides for substantial upgrading of their hospitalsfor the mentally ill. They are also proposing to make an early start on theupgrading of Laughton Lodge Hospital for subnormal patients. Geriatricservices will be improved by the provision of more day hospitals and furthergeriatric beds will be made available in some areas by a reallocation of existingacute beds.Pattern of development the intended pattern of development of the hospital services in the regionis now as follows : Inner London Area A (1)This area includes part of Lambeth and Southwark London Boroughs.The services of this area will be provided mainly by the hospitals of theGuy&apos;s and King&apos;s College Boards of Governors. The hospitals whichwere formerly administered by the Bermondsey and Southwark hospital management Committee are now under the control of the Guy&apos;s Boardof Governors, and those which were formerly administered by the Camber-well Hospital Management Committee are now under the control of theKing&apos;s College Board.

Planned and voluntary migrationsince the war has created many residential areas and an urgent demand for additional hospital facilities.The major problems of the region are: (i) to provide for the increase in population mainly in the Basingstoke,Bournemouth, Portsmouth and Southampton areas;(ii) to improve the diagnostic and treatment facilities at hospitals in otherparts of the Region;(iii) the need for the Regional Board to provide at selected district general hospitals regional specialties usually associated with a teaching hospital;(iv) the need for more beds for the mentally subnormal.The aim of the programme is to provide new district general hospitals in theareas with large increase in population, and to supplement these major projectsby smaller schemes which will improve existing services in other areas. TheBoard also plan to increase the provision of assessment beds for the elderly andthe mentally ill, together with day hospital and rehabilitation facilities closely linked with community care. An additional 450 beds for the mentally sub-normal will be provided to serve the areas such as Bournemouth/Poole and north Hampshire which do not now contain any local hospital services for the mentally subnormal.Pattern of development the intended pattern of development of the hospital services in the region isnow as follows: Portsmouth and Isle of Wight area the general hospital services of the area will be based on Portsmouth andNewport, Isle of Wight. At Portsmouth both St. Mary&apos;s and QueenAlexandra Hospitals are to be developed as complete district general hospitals. At St. James&apos; Hospital, Portsmouth a psychiatric assessmentunit with day hospital facilities will be provided and the further stages of anew unit for children will be completed. With the expected growth in population in this area there may be a need, in the longer term, for a thirddistrict general hospital between Portsmouth and Southampton.Central and North Hampshire area the general hospital services of the area will be concentrated at district general hospitals at Basingstoke and Winchester. A completely newhospital is to be provided for Basingstoke. The Royal Hampshire CountyHospital, Winchester is to be re-built. Psychiatric services are provided at Park Prewett Hospital, Basingstoke, where an alcoholic unit to serve the region has been established.
Southampton and Salisbury area the general hospital services of the area will be based on Southampton andSalisbury. At Southampton both the General Hospital and the RoyalHants Hospital are to be developed as complete district general hospitals.Services for the mentally ill are provided at Knowle Hospital, where up-grading of existing wards will continue, and at the Old Manor Hospital,Salisbury where a psychiatric assessment unit with day hospital facilitieswill be added.Bournemouth and Dorset area the general hospital services of the area will be based on Poole, Bourne-mouth and Dorchester. The new district general hospital now being built at Poole is expected to be completed in 1968. A new district general hospital will be started at Bournemouth. Herrison Hospital, Dorchesterwill remain the main hospital for the mentally ill. St. Anne&apos;s Hospital,Bournemouth, will be the short-stay psychiatric hospital for the Bourne-mouth and Poole areas and day hospital facilities will be provided at theHerbert Hospital and elsewhere in Bournemouth. A unit for seriously disturbed adolescents will be provided at the Herrison Hospital.Major building schemes (New hospitals and building schemes expected to costmore than  250,000).Already in progressPoole new district general hospital phase II.Portsmouth St. Mary&apos;s Hospital new maternity unit.Southampton General Hospital new boiler house, laundry etc.Schemes which it is hoped to start within the period up to 1969/70Schemes which it is hoped to start within the period up to 1969/70 are: Basingstoke maternity unit (expected to start this year).Basingstoke district general hospital new wards, operating theatres,accident department and ancillary departments.Portsmouth Queen Alexandra Hospital new wards, operating theatres,accident department and ancillary departments.Southampton Royal South Hants Hospital radiotherapy centre (expectedto start this year).Southampton General Hospital regional blood transfusion centre.Southampton General Hospital new wards, operating theatres, accidentdepartment and ancillary departments.Winchester Royal Hampshire County Hospital maternity unit.According to present plans, the start of these schemes will be followed by the start of: Basingstoke completion of new district general hospital.Bournemouth first phase of new district general hospital.Portsmouth Queen Alexandra Hospital further development as district general hospital.Poole district general hospital addition of 60 beds.
Southampton Royal South Hants Hospital-new maternity unit.Southampton Royal South Hants Hospital new wards, operating theatresand ancillary departments.Winchester Royal Hampshire County Hospital new wards, operatingtheatres and ancillary departments.Other and later prominent developments in the region are expected toinclude: Dorchester a new district general hospital.Newport, Isle of Wight a new district general hospital.Portsmouth/Southampton area a new district general hospital.Salisbury a new district general hospital.There will also be further phases of development of those district general hospitals on which a start will already have been made.
THE OXFORD HOSPITAL region emphasis of the programme the Oxford Hospital Region has a population of about 1-77 million. Thisis expected to increase to 2-31 million in 1981. The major problem of the region is to provide for this increased population. In addition to the natural growth and influx of population to the main centres in the region, there are several planned developments in prospect. These include a new town in theneighbourhood of Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, and a large increase in thepopulation of Northampton. The further development of the Swindon or WestBerkshire area is also under consideration. Except in the new towns, there isgenerally the nucleus of a district general hospital in each area of the region,and the major part of the Board&apos;s programme consists of developing thesehospitals. The Board proposes to place strong emphasis on the improvementof diagnostic and treatment facilities, particularly in out-patient and accidentdepartments. This should enable greater use to be made of existing beds.The programme also includes substantial expenditure for the Board of governors of the United Oxford Hospitals on the redevelopment of the Oxfordteaching hospital.There is a great need for more hospital accommodation for the mentallysubnormal in this region and the Board are planning to build a new hospital forthis type of patient near Northampton. They are also proposing to redevelopthe hospital for mentally subnormal patients at Manor House, Aylesbury. TheBoard will continue with their programme of modernising hospitals for the mentally ill and providing psychiatric beds in district general hospitals. units for special categories of psychiatric care, e.g., adolescent unit and psychopathicunit, will be provided. The Board will be devoting a share of the funds toreplacing unsatisfactory geriatric accommodation and providing acute geriatricassessment units in district general hospitals.Pattern of development the pattern of development of hospital services in the region is now expectedto be as follows:Central area the district general hospital services for Oxford will continue to beprovided by the hospitals of the teaching group except for specialistorthopaedic services which are provided by the Nuffield OrthopaedicCentre. A new teaching hospital is to be built at Manor Road, Headington.When this is complete the work of the teaching hospital will be concen-* trated at the Radcliffe Infirmary and the new hospital at Manor Road.Psychiatric services for the area will continue to be provided by the Warne-ford Hospital and Littlemore Hospital which also serves the North Westernarea.Northern area the services of the area will centre round district general hospitals atNorthampton and Kettering with a smaller acute and maternity hospital atCorby. The existing hospitals at Kettering and Northampton are being
redeveloped. Hospital services in Wellingborough will eventually becentralised on one site. An entirely new hospital for the mentally sub-normal will be built near Northampton. Services for the mentally ill willcontinue to be provided at St. Crispin Hospital where improvements to existing accommodation are being made.North-Western AreaBanbury is the centre of this area, and the Horton General Hospital will be developed to serve as a district general hospital. Unsatisfactory geriatricaccommodation at Neithrop Hospital will be replaced. Outlying smallhospitals will continue so far as can be foreseen to serve the relativelyisolated communities with a small number of beds for acute and geriatricpatients.Western area the main hospital centre will be at Swindon and further development ofthe new Princess Margaret Hospital is planned. Eventually a secondgeneral hospital is likely to be needed at Swindon. Circencester willcontinue to look towards Swindon for many of its acute facilities but theintention eventually will be to centralise hospital services in Cirencester on one site. Accommodation for the mentally subnormal will continue to beprovided at Pewsey where further upgrading will be necessary.Southern area the main facilities will continue to be provided at the Royal Berkshire andBattle Hospitals, in Reading, which will be developed as complementarydistrict general hospitals. Increase of population may warrant a district general hospital at Newbury. It is proposed to redevelop facilities inWallingford, Wokingham and Henley to provide a small number of bedsfor local needs. Psychiatric services will be based on Borocourt Hospitalfor the mentally subnormal and Fairmile Hospital for the mentally ill;further modernisation of both of these hospitals will be nececessary.Eastern AreaStoke Mandeville and High Wycombe Hospitals are being developed as themain acute, maternity and geriatric centres for this area. Supplementaryfacilities are provided at Amersham. It is likely to be necessary in time toprovide a new hospital to serve the proposed new town in North Bucks.Meanwhile a maternity unit and diagnostic centre at Bletchley will serve asa basis for this development. Manor House Hospital, Aylesbury for the mentally subnormal is to be redeveloped. Psychiatric facilities will be at st.. John&apos;s, Stone, with associated units at the district general hospitals.Major building schemes (New hospitals and building schemes expected to costmore than  250,000).Already in progressAmersham General Hospital redevelopment phase I.Bletchley general practitioner maternity unit.Borocourt Hospital-development-phase II.

THE SOUTH WESTERN HOSPITAL region emphasis of the programme the South Western Hospital Region has a population of just over 3 million.This is expected to increase to about 3-37 million in 1981. The proportion ofelderly people is very high. There are at present 422,000 people aged 65 andover in the region and the number is expected to increase by over 19 per cent,to about 505,000 in 1981. During the summer months, up to 5 million holiday-makers visit the South West. One of the main problems of providing a modernhospital service for the region is the distance between the main centres of population and the many small, relatively isolated communities to be served.Road and rail communications are long, and can be seriously impeded by bad weather in winter and holiday traffic in summer.The region is at present served by a large number of small and medium sizedhospitals. The main emphasis of the Regional Board&apos;s programme is on providingdistrict general hospitals throughout the region. Existing hospitals are to be re-developed in Bristol, Exeter, Yeovil, Torquay, Gloucester, Plymouth, Bath andCheltenham. New hospitals are to be built in Exeter, Plymouth, Barnstaple,Truro, Weston-super-Mare, Taunton and South Bristol. But many smallerexisting hospitals will still be needed, especially for geriatric units, and these areto be upgraded to modern standards and extended where necessary.The number of existing psychiatric beds exceeds long term needs. Theintention is to upgrade the main hospitals for the mentally ill, to reduce thenumber of beds by closing less satisfactory units and to provide acute psy-chiatric units in all the new district general hospitals. Existing hospitals for the mentally subnormal will be upgraded and reduced in size and the distributionimproved by building new units at Gloucester and in Cornwall.Pattern of development the pattern of development of the hospital services in the region is now expected to be as follows: North Gloucestershire AreaGeneral hospital services will centre on a reconstructed GloucestershireRoyal Hospital and the General Hospital at Cheltenham which will eventually be redeveloped. Mental illness provision will be based on ConeyHill Hospital, with a psychiatric unit at the Gloucestershire Royal nearby,and eventually at Cheltenham. A new hospital for mentally subnormalpatients is planned for Gloucester. Additional geriatric provision will alsobe made, including a new wing at the Dilke Memorial Hospital.Bristol AreaServices for Bristol itself will be based on four main hospitals, the UnitedBristol, Southmead, Frenchay and the new South Bristol Hospitals. the bristol teaching hospital is being redeveloped on the St. Michael&apos;s Hill site,t and major improvements are being carried out at Southmead and Frenchay.A new hospital is planned to serve South Bristol. Additional geriatric
provision will include a unit at the teaching hospital and a new unit atManor Park Hospital. A new district general hospital will be built atWeston-super-Mare, and this will enable the Royal Hospital to be used forgeriatric purposes. Mental subnormality services will be based on StokePark Hospital, which is to be redeveloped, and Hortham and BrentryHospitals which also serve the Bath area. Mental illness patients willcontinue to be served by Glenside, The Manor and Barrow Hospitals, andacute units at the teaching hospital and Weston.Bath area the intention is to concentrate the main hospital provision at Combe Park,Bath and, ultimately, a smaller hospital at Trowbridge. Mental illnessservices will be based on Roundway Hospital, Devizes, which will befurther modernized, and an acute unit at Combe Park.South Somerset AreaServices for the area will eventually centre on a new district general hospitalat Lyngford, Taunton and the smaller reconstructed General Hospital atYeovil. Bridgwater Hospital will also be redeveloped. Additional geriatricprovision will be made, including new units at Summerlands and Verring-ton, near Yeovil. Yeovil General Hospital will include a unit for mental illness patients, but the main centre will remain at Tone Vale Hospital,Taunton, which is being upgraded, until it is finally replaced by provisionat Lyngford. Mental subnormality provision will be concentrated atSandhill Park, which is also to be upgraded.Devon and Exeter area the main hospital services for Exeter will be concentrated at a new district general hospital at Wonford, and the redeveloped City Hospital. TorbayHospital is also to be redeveloped, and a new hospital provided at Barn-staple. Geriatric services will centre on Exeter City, Newton Abbot, andthe new Barnstaple Hospitals. The unit for mentally subnormal patientsat Langdon, Exeter, will be extended. Mental illness services will be mainlyconcentrated at Exe Vale, with acute units at Wonford, Torquay andBarnstaple.Plymouth areas new district general hospital at Derriford, and a redeveloped Greenbank-Freedom Fields Hospital, will provide the main hospital services inPlymouth. Maternity provision will centre on Freedom Fields. Mount GoldHospital is to be redeveloped. Additional geriatric provision will be made,including units at Mount Gold and Plympton Hospitals. Moorhaven willcontnue to serve mental illness patients.West Cornwall area the main hospital centre will be the new district general hospital atTreliske, Truro, which will release beds elsewhere for geriatric and psy-chiatric use. A small district general hospital will ultimately be providedfor Penzance. A new geriatric unit is to be built at St. Austell. Provisionfor mental illness patients will be based on St. Lawrence&apos;s, Bodmin, which
is being redeveloped, and acute units at Barncoose, Redruth, and theRoyal Cornwall Infirmary, Truro. New developments for mentally sub-normal patients are also planned in the area.Major building schemes (New hospitals and building schemes expected to costmore than  250,000).Already in progressBarnstaple new district general hospital phase I.Bristol Royal Hospital for Sick Children new out-patient department.Bristol Royal Infirmary redevelopment phase I (part).Bristol Southmead Hospital new operating theatres.Bristol Southmead Hospital blood transfusion centre.Exeter Wonford new district general hospital phase I.Gloucester Coney Hill Hospital reorganisation of engineering servicesand new laundry.Taunton Tone Vale Hospital reorganisation of engineering services.Truro-Treliske-new district general hospital phase II (including maternityunit).Yeovil General Hospital redevelopment phase I (including maternityunit).Schemes which it is hoped to start in the period up to 1969/70.Bath Combe Park redevelopment (accident and emergency and out-patient departments).Bristol Royal Infirmary redevelopment new accident and out-patientdepartment phase I (expected to start this year).Bristol Royal Infirmary redevelopment new radiotherapy centre.Bristol Royal Infirmary redevelopment maternity unit.Bristol Stoke Park redevelopment phase I.Exeter City Hospital redevelopment (expected to start this year).Exeter Wonford new district general hospital phase II (including 424acute beds).Gloucester Royal Hospital redevelopment phase III (including 496beds).Plymouth Derriford new district general hospital phase I (including 300acute beds and accident and emergency department).Torbay redevelopment phase lb (including 112 beds) (expected to start this year).Weston-super-Mare new district general hospital phase I (maternity unit).Yeovil redevelopment phase II (including 266 acute beds).According to present plans, the start of these schemes will be followed by the start of: Barnstaple new district general hospital phase II.Bath Combe Park redevelopment phase II.Bristol Royal Infirmary redevelopment phase II (including ward block).Bristol South new district general hospital phase I.

THE BIRMINGHAM HOSPITAL region emphasis of the programme the Birmingham Hospital Region has a population of about 4-98 million,with at present a high proportion of people of working age and a relatively lowproportion of the elderly. The population is expected to rise by one-fifth toabout 5-97 million in 1981, through a high rate of natural increase accentuated by migration into the region.The major problems of the region are: (i) to provide for this large increase in population, anticipating changes inits age structure and distribution resulting from movement to areas of growth and the New Towns proposed at Dawley and Redditch;(ii) the need for more and better hospital accommodation in areas which already have large populations;(iii) the need elsewhere for improvements at many existing hospitals of all types, and for better geriatric and psychiatric services.The principal aim of the programme is to make progress with provision of district general hospitals throughout the region, either by building new hospitalsor by reconstructing the diagnostic and treatment departments of existinghospitals, with additions and improvements to the ward accommodation and supporting services. The Regional Hospital Board intend to concentrate certainspecialties at selected hospitals to serve regional or sub-regional catchmentareas. They will also substantially increase day places for psychiatric andgeriatric patients and add to the in-patient accommodation for the mentallysubnormal.The Board of Governors will continue to concentrate the teaching hospitalgroup alongside the Birmingham University Medical School, from which theoutput of medical students is to be increased.Pattern of development the intended pattern of development of the hospital services in the region isnow as follows: *Birmingham (North West), Warley and West Bromwich area the services will be based on two district general hospitals, one to be developed on the site of Dudley Road Hospital, Summerfield Hospital andAll Saints Hospital by means of new and upgraded accommodation andthe other at West Bromwich mainly by new building. All Saints Hospital,and the Psychiatric Early Treatment Centre with mental illness beds are inthis area, the latter drawing patients from all parts of the region.Birmingham (Central) and South East Staffordshire area the services of the area will be based on the General Hospital, Birmingham,which will be redeveloped, and the district general hospital being built at* The Birmingham conurbation has been treated as a whole in the planning of its servicesthough divided for purposes of description into five areas.
Good Hope Hospital, Sutton Coldfield. The psychiatric hospitals in this area are Highcroft Hospital and St. Matthew&apos;s Hospital, near Lichfieldwith mental illness beds, and St. magaret&apos;s Hospital, near Birmingham,with mental subnormality beds. St. Matthew&apos;s and St. magaret&apos;s Hospitalsalso serve other areas.Birmingham (East) and Solihull area the services will be based on district general hospitals at East BirminghamHospital, which will be extended by a combination of new building andadaptation, and at Solihull Hospital, which will have to be rebuilt. Holy-moor Hospital with mental illness beds is in this area. Coleshill HallHospital, Chelmsley Hospital, Monyhull Hospital, Birmingham, andMiddlefield Hospital, Knowle, with mental subnormality beds, are in this area and also serve other areas.Birmingham (South West) and North East Worcestershire area the services will be based in the longer term on two district general hospitals one at Selly Oak and another at Redditch. A large new geriatrichospital will be built at Moseley Hall. The psychiatric hospitals in this area are Rubery Hill Hospital, the newly built John Conolly Hospital andBarnsley Hall Hospital, with mental illness beds, and Lea Hospital,Bromsgrove, with mental subnormality beds. They also serve other areas.Birmingham (Edgbaston and district) area the teaching hospital centre at Edgbaston will undertake a district service in addition to its present functions. When new buildings have been con-structed it will also provide services for the Birmingham conurbation now given by the Birmingham Accident Hospital and the Birmingham andMidland Eye Hospital.North Staffordshire and Shropshire area the services will be based on the district general hospitals already being developed at Stoke and Shrewsbury; on district general hospitals to be developed at Burton-on-Trent and Stafford; and on a new district general hospital for the Dawley district. Psychiatric hospitals in this area are St.Edward&apos;s Hospital, near Leek, St. George&apos;s Hospital, Stafford and SheltonHospital, Shrewsbury, with mental illness beds, and Stallington HallHospital, near Stoke, with mental subnormality beds. St. George&apos;s Hospitalalso serves other areas.South Worcestershire, Worcester and Herefordshire area the services will be based on district general hospitals to be developed inthe longer term at Worcester and Hereford. Psychiatric hospitals in this area are Powick Hospital, near Worcester, St. Mary&apos;s Hospital and HolmeLacy Hospital, Hereford, and St. Wulstan&apos;s Hospital, Malvern, with mental illness beds, and Dean Hill Hospital, Ross-on-Wye, with mental sub-normality beds. St. Wulstan&apos;s Hospital draws patients from all parts ofthe region.
Coventry and Warwickshire area the services will be based on district general hospitals at Coventry, Nun-eaton, Rugby and Warwick. In the Warwick district the WarnefordHospital, Leamington Spa, the Warwick Hospital and the Stratford-upon-Avon Hospital will have to be improved in order to maintain the existing services until the new district general hospital is built. Central Hospital,near Warwick, and South Warwickshire Children&apos;s Recovery Hospital,Stratford-upon-Avon, with mental illness beds, and the Weston Hospital,. near Leamington Spa, with mental subnormality beds are in this area.Wolverhampton, Wahall and South West Staffordshire area the services will be based on district general hospitals to be developed atWolverhampton by extensive new building and adaptation and at Walsall.Dudley and North West Worcestershire area the services of the area will be based on a new district general hospital tobe built at Dudley and a district general hospital already being developedfrom existing hospitals at Kidderminster.

THE MANCHESTER HOSPITAL region emphasis of the programme the Manchester Hospital Region has a population of about 4-55 million.This is expected to increase to 4-95 million in 1981. More significant than the overall increase in population is the movement of population away from theformer industrial centres to the newer residential areas, particularly towardsSouth Manchester and North Cheshire where already the population has out-stripped the hospital provision and where two entirely new district general hospitals at Wythenshawe and Cheadle are planned.The main problem in the region is that most of the existing hospitals have their origins in the industrial revolution and, despite much upgrading and increased provision of diagnostic and treatment facilities since 1948 the stage hasnow been reached where the possibilities of expansion to accommodate the growing work load and the requirements of modern medical developments arephysically limited. Accordingly the programme will be mainly one of phasedrebuilding of major hospitals either on their existing or new sites. The maindeficiency in number and quality of beds is in maternity and acute and, withsome exceptions, the first phase of rebuilding will often be the provision of newmaternity departments, with additional service facilities where necessary.Growing pressure on the acute hospitals requires that the second phase shouldbe the provision of acute hospital facilities, and, in the main, the provision ofpsychiatric and geriatric beds will follow on as third phases.The programme also includes substantial expenditure on the redevelopmentof the hospitals in the United Manchester Teaching Group on a site which includes that of the existing Manchester Royal Infirmary.Over the last 10 years the psychiatric beds in the large mental hospitals havebeen reduced by 20 per cent, mainly as a result of the development of compre-hensive psychiatric departments in general hospitals. This policy will continue.The mental subnormality hospitals have to provide for a large number of patients from the Liverpool Region and are overcrowded. Relief will be afforded by the additional wards currently being built at Cranage Hall hospital and by increased provision in the Liverpool Region.Subject to what has been said about phasing of major redevelopment, priorityhas been given as far as possible to the provision of geriatric and psychiatrichospital facilities. In the Wigan and Stockport areas major schemes forgeriatric and psychiatric accommodation respectively have been brought forward. A psychiatric unit of 160 beds is proposed at an early date in SouthManchester. Elsewhere accommodation vacated on the completion of other schemes will be upgraded and converted to geriatric or psychiatric use where-ever suitable.Pattern of development the pattern of development of the hospital services in the region is now expected to be as follows: 
Northern AreaPreston will be developed as the Northern sub-centre for the region incertain specialties, e.g., radiotherapy, plastic surgery, neuro-surgery andneurology. A new district general hospital will be built there and further developments will take place at Sharoe Green Hospital and at Chorley and district Hospital to complement the provision for the Preston and Chorleyarea. A new district general hospital will also be built in Barrow. Theextension and redevelopment of Blackpool Victoria and Royal LancasterHospitals to district general hospital standards will continue. Somehospital facilities will be retained at Kendal to provide a partial service tothe area.North Eastern AreaBlackburn Royal Infirmary and Burnley and District General Hospital willcontinue to be developed as district general hospitals. The proposal toredevelop Queen&apos;s Park as the second district general hospital for theBlackburn area has been abandoned in favour of provision in the long termof an entirely new hospital to be built at the opposite end of the town toBlackburn Royal Infirmary. The proposal to build a small maternity unitat Accrington Victoria Hospital has been deferred pending re-examinationof the planning and content of the scheme.West Manchester area the main service for the Wigan and Leigh area will be provided by threecomplementary hospitals, Billinge, Leigh Infirmary and the completelyredeveloped Royal Albert Edward Infirmary, Wigan; the service for Boltonand district will be centred on the extended and improved Bolton district general Hospital and Bolton Royal Infirmary; Salford and District will be served by the completely redeveloped Hope Hospital and an entirely newdistrict general hospital to be built near the north west boundary ofSalford; and Park Hospital in West Manchester will be re-developed as a district general hospital.North and East ManchesterFor the foreseeable future the hospital service in this area will continue tobe provided mainly by the existing hospitals although a start will be made upon the redevelopment of Ashton General Hospital by the building of anew maternity unit. In the long term new district general hospitals areenvisaged at Bury, Oldham and two in North and East Manchester. In themeantime developments will be directed towards the continuing improve-ment of existing hospitals.South Manchester AreaNew district general hospitals will be built at Wythenshawe and Cheadle,and Withington and Stepping Hill Hospitals will be redeveloped and extended as district general hospitals.

THE LIVERPOOL HOSPITAL region emphasis of the programme the Liverpool Hospital Region has a population of about 2 -2m. This is expectedto increase to 2-5m. in 1981. The increase in population will present less of a problem than movement of population within the region particularly from thecentre of Liverpool to the periphery. This has already been most marked in thenorth east of the Liverpool area and has made the provision of a new district general hospital to serve this area a matter of urgency. New Towns are being built at Runcorn and Skelmersdale and it is proposed that the hospitals to servethem should grow with the growth of population. The first step will be theprovision of diagnostic and therapeutic centres in each town. The hospitalsserving the Birkenhead and Chester areas are old and quite unsuitable forredevelopment as district general hospitals and it has therefore been foundnecessary to build new district hospitals, the completion of which will enableother uses to be made of the existing hospitals. A new district general hospitalis also to be provided to serve the Warrington area which at present has insuffi-cient beds for its needs.The process of rebuilding existing hospitals will continue with the object of improving the facilities rather than of increasing the number of beds. Accidentand emergency centres will be concentrated in larger but fewer units enablingan effective service with the most modern equipment to be available at all times of the day or night.The Regional Board have provided facilities for certain important specialitiesat regional centres. Two such centres, neuro-surgery at Walton Hospital andradio-therapy at Clatterbridge Hospital have outgrown their existing accommoda-tion and the programme provides for these to be extended and improved.A new teaching hospital is being built in the centre of Liverpool which willprovide improved teaching facilities for a larger number of students and will bring together on one site a number of teaching units which are at presentdispersed. Work on a new dental hospital is also in progress; this will replace the existing hospital and will provide facilities which will enable the presentstudent intake to be increased.Developments some of which have been completed and the remainder ofwhich are in progress will, when commissioned, reduce the dependency of the region on Manchester Region for beds for mental sub-normality patients.There is a sufficiency of beds in the region for patients suffering from mental illness but provision has been made for the programme of improvements to wardsand engineering services in the mental hospitals, which is already in progress,to be continued.Schemes which will provide improved accommodation for the elderly areplanned for Chester City and Warrington Hospitals.Pattern of development the pattern of development of the hospital services in the region is now expected to be as follows: 
Liverpool area the services of the area will centre round a new district general hospitalnow being built at Fazakerley and the Walton, Broadgreen, and SeftonHospitals which will be expanded and developed.The new teaching hospital now being built in the city is also expected toprovide a district general hospital service.The Mill Road Maternity and Liverpool Maternity Hospitals will supple-ment the maternity services being provided at the general hospitals. Treat-ment for patients suffering from infectious diseases will be provided at theFazakerley I.D. Hospital and in the case of tuberculosis at the AintreeHospital. The Alder Hey Children&apos;s Hospital will continue to providepaediatric services for the area but will require additional theatres and newaccident and out-patient departments. The considerable expansion of theOlive Mount Children&apos;s Hospital which is now in progress will enable alarger proportion of the mentally subnormal children and adolescents tobe treated locally, but it will still be necessary for adult patients to betreated outside the area. The majority of elderly medium and long-staypatients will be accommodated at Newsham Hospital at which work onimprovements to wards and services will continue.Further work on improving wards and services will be carried out atRainhill Hospital which will continue to provide treatment for patientssuffering from mental illness. .Southport and Ormskirk AreaAlthough the services of the area will eventually be centred on district general hospitals at Southport, and Ormskirk or Skelmersdale, these willnot be built for many years. In the meantime the services at Southportwill be centred on the Southport and Promenade Hospitals and at Ormskirkon the Ormskirk County Hospital. Maternity services at Southport willbe provided at the Christiana Hartley Maternity Hospital. A diagnosticand therapeutic centre which will be built at Skelmersdale within the ten-year period will provide out-patient, minor accident and diagnostic services for the New Town, and will form the first phase of the new district general hospital.Greaves Hall Hospital provides accommodation for mentally subnormalpatients from all over the region. A phase has recently been completedwhich has more than doubled the accommodation at this hospital and work has now begun on a third phase which will still further increase the accom-modation. When the new wards are commissioned the region&apos;s dependence on the Manchester Region for beds for mentally subnormal patients will be substantially reduced.St. Helens and Warrington area the services of the area will centre round a new district hospital to be built at Winwick and the Whiston, St. Helens, and Warrington Hospitals.A new maternity unit is to be built at Whiston Hospital and the diagnosticservices improved, while at Warrington extensive redevelopment is planned.It is envisaged that new district general hospitals will eventually be built
to take over the work now done at Whiston and St. Helens Hospitals butit will be many years before a start can be made on them.The Winwick Psychiatric Hospital will continue to provide facilities for patients suffering from mental illness who require medium and long-termtreatment.Chester and Wirral area the services of the area will centre round new district hospitals to be built at Birkenhead and Chester together with the Clatterbridge Hospital whichwill be extensively developed.The Deva Hospital will continue to provide facilities for patients sufferingfrom mental illness who require medium and long-term treatment.Major building schemes (New Hospitals and building schemes expected to costmore than  250,000).Already in progress.Liverpool new regional blood transfusion unit.Liverpool Olive Mount Children&apos;s Hospital enlarged accommodation formentally subnormal children.Liverpool Walton Hospital new operating theatres, out-patient andaccident departments, and new boiler-house.Liverpool new teaching hospital. new dental hospital.Liverpool Fazakerley new district general hospital.Southport Greaves Hall new wards and services.Schemes which it is hoped to start within the period up to 1969/70.Birkenhead Arrowe Park new district general hospital.Clatterbridge Hospital new laundry, boiler-house, central sterile supply department and pathology laboratory.

WALESEmphasis of the programmeWales has a population of about 2-69 million. This is expected to increase to about 2-92 million in 1981. The increase will, for the most part, occur in the coastal area of the industrial south east where, if present trends continue, it isexpected to be of the order of \ million. An increase is also expected in thenorth east of some 50,000 and a slight increase in the south west. Over the restof the country the changes are not likely to be significant in the context of thehospital programme except that if the proposal to develop a new town inMontgomeryshire is adopted, the population projections for this east centralarea of Wales will obviously be affected.
