ll3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C(66) 100 COPY NO.8th July, 1966iCABINETSURVEY OF CURRENT WORK. ON PRODUCTIVITYMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Board of Trade undertakes certain work of a general character designed to increase productivity which is referred to briefly inparagraphs 2-4 below.    In addition, in its dealings with the wide range of very different industries for which it has production responsibility, it is constantly seeking to promote progress in increasing productivity (and exports) in ways which are most appropriate to the circumstances and problems of each industry.    It is impossible to describe its work withparticular trade associations and individual firms comprehensively withinthe compass of this paper.    Paragraphs 5-14 below attempt to describebriefly the main lines of this work and the problems to be tackled in someof the principal industries for which the Board is responsible.General Functions2. The first of the Board&apos;s general functions arises from itsresponsibility for the work of a number of organisations, the mostimportant of which are the British Productivity Council (BPC) and theBritish Institute of Management (BIM).    The BPC, whose main source of income is the Board of Trade grant (which has been increased in the current financial year), exercises most of its influence through a large number oflocal Productivity Committees or Associations, which arrange discussiongroups, lectures, etc, , for employers and trade unionists.    The BPC alsoproduces a monthly newspaper, (&quot;Target&quot;) directed mainly at the shopfloorand lower levels of management.    In October the BPC will be launching a&quot;Quality and Reliability Year&quot; which is to be a follow-up of the 1963National Productivity Year.    The BIM has a similar essentially educationalfunction.    Its services include a.n advisory service on managementtechniques, the arrangement of study groups and conferences and themaintenance of a confidential register of management and industrialconsultants.    Unlike the BPC the BIM is normally self-financing.    It is,however, receiving a special Government grant over the next three years toenable it to expand certain activities including its regional work and themanagement education information unit.3, A second responsibility which is relevant in this context is theadministration of the new investment grants.    These will give a powerfulincentive to investment in the sectors where increased productivity can contribute most directly towards economic growth and the improvement ofthe trade balance.-1-
4. Finally, the industrial location policy of the Board, which isbeing pursued with increasing effectiveness, is helping productivity by bringing into use resources in Development Areas which would otherwise be unproductively employed or not employed at all.Developments in Particular IndustriesA.    Textiles5. The main textile industries - cotton, wool knitting and clothing -are at different stages of evolution and vary widely in the pattern of their organisation and production.    But in all of them, the increasing use ofman-made fibres has given the two major man-made fibre producers,Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), and Courtaulds, a growing interest intheir future.    This interest ha.s gone furthest in the cotton industry where,with the encouragement of the Board, the fibre producers have sunk a greatdeal of money in its reorganisation and have a direct and vital interest inits transformation from a low-wage labour-intensive industry to one whichwill consist of relatively few highly capital-intensive units.    The wool,knitting and clothing industries are still, in the main fragmented in theirstructure.    The knitting industry, which has had the advantage of high speedsophisticated machinery for longer than cotton or wool, is growing fast andis probably ahead of the rest of textiles in its attention to productivity.    the clothing industry is, for the most part, efficient by world standards and ithas hit a period of successful design which has resulted in a 50 per centgrowth in exports between I960 and 1964, and an estimated grov/th of another 75 per cent between 1964 and 1970.    The following paragraphs giveshort notes on the individual textile industries:(i)     Cotton     The Cotton Board have agreed to participate in a majorstudy of the means of promoting productivity.    This forms partof a comprehensive programme for the reorganisation of theindustry, of which the essential preliminary is the five-yearlimitation of low-priced cotton textile imports.    Much hasalready been done to improve productivity as a result both of the intervention of the man-made fibre producers and of the work doneby the Cotton Board&apos;s Productivity Centre.    But the study nowbeing planned can be pressed to secure more rapid progress,especially in the fields of integrated production and marketing.(ii)     Wool    The structural problems of this industry are formidable.Its units appear to be, in general, too small to sustain the investment needed to modernise its production and to enable itto  *ay the wages which will retain an adequate labour force.Three steps have recently been taken to tackle this situation.The Economic Development Committee (EDC), after considerablehesitation, is about to embark on consideration of the structure of the industry and of the economies of scale production.    Theindustry is discussing with the Board other means of fosteringstructural reform which might help to provide more adequatemanagement and finance.    Thirdly, the Board of Trade have proposed that the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation (1958-59)should include the industry among its candidates for examination.(iii)    Knitting and clothing   EDCs have recently been set up for both these industries and will shortly be considering their productivityproblems.    The clothing industry now appears, after considerable pressure, to be successfully concerting its export efforts underthe guidance of a newly established Clothing Export Council.- 2-
B.    Shipbuilding;6. A great deal of wo rk is in hand on the reorganisation of the shipbuilding Industry following the publication of the Geddes Report.    ThisReport shows that the industry has declined for many years because of low productivity caused by poor management and restrictive labourpractices, recommends major changes in the structure of the industry andin its industrial relations and makes progress within the industry on thesea precondition for Government assistance by way of loans and grants.The changes envisaged for this industry should lead to a major increasein its productivity.    Both sides of the industry have now accepted the needfor the major changes proposed and I shall shortly be submitting proposals to my colleagues for the implementation of the Geddes Report.G.    Chemicals7. This industry is a capital-intensive and has a good record ofincreasing productivity.    For years the main firms in the industry,particularly ICI, have been leaders in productivity studies and the industry has developed a fairly comprehensive productivity structure of tradeunions and management, who share ths-chairmanship of the Industry&apos;sProductivity Committees.    A considerable amount of work on the efficient use of labour has been carried out by the productivity committees of the chemical Industries Association and the Trade Unions.8. The EDC for the Chemical Industry recently made a study which indicated, that the manning of German firms was comparable with manningin the United Kingdom but that sales per employee in the United states were approximately twice the value in the United Kingdom or Germany.A team of management and unions is to visit United States chemical plantsfor a detailed follow-up study of the problem.    This visit which will bepartly financed by the Government is due to take place in October of thisyear.    The Man-Power Sub-Committee of the EDC is also collectinginformation about the forms of productivity agreements v/hich have been introduced in the industry.D. Paper and Board9. This industry is covered by an EDC which has appointed a working party to inquire into the productivity and structure of the industry and isalso discussing suggestions put forward by the trade union representatives on the best means of increasing productivity.    There have, in fact, been considerable changes within the industry in recent years, partlystimulated by JSuropean Free Trade Association competition, e.g. aconsiderable concentration of production and the installation of highproductivity machines.    More uneconomic mills are likely to close.Four-shift working is gradually being introduced.    An integrated pulp and paper mill has been set up in Scotland with Government assistance and similar mills are being set up in Cumberland and at Bristol to make thebest use of available supplies of home-grown timber.E. Printing and Publishing10. There are about 138, 000 people employed in newspaper andperiodical work, and about 235, 000 in other printing and publishingactivities.    There is a considerable volume of work on productivity being undertaken in a number of different ways.    The EDC which was set up inJanuary, 1966 is examining a number of subjects including the availabilityand use of plant and new developments in research.    A Joint Man-Power-3-
Committee for General Printing and Provincial Newspapers was set up at the beginning of 1965 to examine the efficient use of labour; itsindependent Chairman is Mr. R.  0!Brien of the Department ofEconomic Affairs.    Following the dispute at the InternationalPublishing Corporation^ Southwark plant the Minister of Labour setup a Court of Inquiry under Lord Cameron to look into the problems arising from the introduction of web-off set machines and other modernprinting techniques.Nqn-Ferrous Metals Semi-Manufactures11.     The main progress in this field, made more essential by the rhodesian situation, has been in encouraging economy in the use ofthe more expensive metalst particularly copper, and in encouraging the use of substitutes for these metals.    My Department have encouraged the increased use of domestic scrap, by propaganda andby stricter control over exports.    We have accelerated the establish-rnent of new standards e. g. thin-walled copper tubes etc. which require less copper and are some 30 per cent cheaper than previousstandard copper tubes; we have also encouraged the changeover,where technically appropriate, from copper to aluminium in manysizes of cables and wires.    My Department have maintained close touch with all user Government Departments to encourage readyacceptance of these newer products.    In addition we have attempted to encourage new long-term projects within the industry which arelikely substantially to increase productivity and save imports.    Atpresent we are discussing with the Ministry of Technology ways to stimulate research and development projects within the industry andare investigating ways to bring about the more efficient recovery of scrap,G.    M i s c e llane ou s12.     There are a large number of other, generally smaller,industries not covered by EDCs whose progress in achieving increased productivity has varied greatly.    In some cases parts of these industries are in the process of transition from an older, traditionalcraft basis to something more like a modern industry.Pottery (employing 65,000 people) is a good exporting industryand imports are small.    There ha.s been progress in rationalisationrecently and some mergers.    Efforts are being made by some firms to mechanise their production more effectively.    However, the rateof further progress may not be sufficient to enable them to hold their export markets in the face of increased competition.    In the glassindustry (employment 57,900 people excluding flat glass), theproduction of glass containers is largely mechanised and further progress is being made.    We have been trying to encourage theproduction of machine-made domestic glass to replace traditionalimports in the medium price range.
14.     The toy industry (34,000 employees) has some vigorous andand enterprising firms and has been expanding its exports usefully.In the case of footwear (115, 000 employees) there have been considerable changes in recent years with advances in technologyleading to fundamental changes in the industry^ methods.    Therehas been a steady and continuing decline in the total number of manufacturing units but there is scope for further considerableconcentration of production.D. P. T. J.Board of Trade, S.
