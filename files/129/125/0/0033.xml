CONFIDENTIAL -        348Krj3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 83 COPY NO. 6 /17th June, 1966CABINETARBITRATION AND COURTS OF INQUIRYMemorandum by the Minister of LabourArbitrationIn C(66) 82 the First Secretary of State discusses the future ofarbitration and makes proposals aimed at aligning the arbitrationsystem more closely with Prices and Incomes Policy.2.       I think we need to examine in the first place what is the truefunction of an arbitrator, to consider whether that function ought to be preserved and if so, whether an arbitrator can exercise his arbitralfunction and at the same time act as an instrument for the application of incomes policy.    This paper does not deal with Review Bodies whosefunction is advisory.3.       It is true, as the First Secretary says in his paper, that only asmall proportion of wage increases in the private sector are settled atarbitration.    We should not, however, be misled into thinking thatarbitration is therefore unimportant in the field of private employment,and I hope we shall not under-estimate its usefulness to industrial relations.    Arbitration, v/hich is not, of course, concerned only with pay claims is essentially a part of our collective bargaining system.It is a device to enable negotiating parties to reach agreement whenthey are unable to do so by direct negotiation.    It is therefore anextension of the negotiating process to be invoked by the parties, ifthey are both so agreed, to serve their purposes.4.       I appreciate that the position is rather different in the public sector, and particularly in the public services, where arbitration iscommonly resorted to and is regarded by the trade unions and staff associations as the normal and accepted way of dealing with disputes.This is particularly the case where the strike weapon is not normallyused.    In the private sector arbitration is only one of a series ofalternatives, including strike action, which face negotiating parties v/henthey cannot reach agreement.    We have seen in the past that attempts to influence arbitrators have led to a considerable falling-off in the useof this method of reaching decisions on wages and conditions and weshould, I think, be careful before we run any risk of undermining theconfidence of industry in the impartiality of arbitration.5.       Looked at from this point of view I accept that we must expectarbitration to demonstrate some of the defects of the collective bargaining system itself.    We do not expect joint voluntary agreements to be uniformly of a kind which are acceptable to Prices and incomes policy;  the arguments deployed by negotiating parties, both in joint.   -1-
CONFIDENTIAL &apos;       349discussions and in appearances before arbitrators, are rarely dis-interested and seldom wholly satisfactory from the point of view of thenational interest.    While we cannot control the collective bargainingprocess, however, it is, in my view, out of the question to considerimporting control at the stage when disputes are referred to arbitration.6.       The position of an arbitrator, however anxious he may be thathis award should conform to the national interest, is very oftenprejudiced by the negotiations which have preceded the decision to go to arbitration.    The simplest illustration is the case where both a claim and an offer are well above the norm;  in such circumstances, neitherthe arbitrator nor the parties would expect that he would depart fromhis arbitral function of resolving their differences by making an awardcompletely outside the area of difference.7.       To sum up therefore, the function of an arbitrator, as it isconceived at present, is to settle by independent decision cases in whichnegotiating parties have been unable to agree, and if the parties in dispute (and particularly trade unions) are to continue to have recourse to this peaceful means of settling disputes I think we must accept that thesystem is liable to throw up individual decisions which may be an embarrassment to Prices and Incomes Policy.    In spite of its drawbacksthe present arbitration system is a useful adjunct to our present industrial relations system.3.      At the same time, there are steps which we can usefully take toensure that, so far as the system permits it, arbitrators do take accountof the national interest in making their awards.    The most important isto ensure that in the choice of arbitrators we select individuals with a wide background knowledge of the economic situation in general and thePrices and Incomes Policy in particular, so that they are naturallydisposed to pay regard to the interest of the community and to try as faras they can to reconcile these with the facts and merits of the individual cases with which they deal.    The persons whom I appoint either toStanding Arbitration ?i&apos;ribunals or to ad hoc arbitrations are of this kind,and as a class I have much confidence in them.    A good deal orarbitration in industry, however, takes place without any intervention on my part, in accordance with arrangements agreed by the parties.9.      Another step we might take is to improve the briefing of arbitratorswhom I appoint.    At present we supply them with relevant publications,e.g. reports of the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI),Yfhite Papers and statistical bulletins, etc.    We might prepare factualbriefs for arbitrators which, without in any way suggesting how an individual case should be settled would emphasise relevant considerations in the case.    This seems to me to be a better and more practicalproposal than that the Government should itself give evidence inarbitration cases.10.      The functions of the NBPI are clearly different from those of anarbitrator and its decisions and recommendations are not limited byany considerations other than those of the public interest.    the distinctive functions of the NBPI might be emphasised by referring-2-
some arbitration awards to the Board to demonstrate that theGovernment is willing when necessary to question arbitration awardslike other forms of settlement which may be inconsistent with its policy.The Board itself might well want to consider an award and I think weshould be prepared to consider suggestions made by the 3oard.    I donot favour the tripartite declaration which is suggested in C(66) 82.    I doubt the chances of securing agreement to such a declaration but, thisapart, I doubt whether it would be effective except in discouragingrecourse to arbitration.Courts of Inquiry, etc.11.      I agree with the objectives set out in paragraph 6 of C(66) 82.I doubt, however, whether it would be politic to agree here and now thatin every case when a Court or Committee is appointed we should insertin the terms of reference a requirement that the Court in its reportmust have specific regard to the national interest.    Courts of Inquiryare generally set up in situations of extreme delicacy and we need tohave some room for manoeuvre.    I should, however, be willing toaccept the proposals in this paragraph as desirable in principle.R. J. G. iMinistry of Labour, S.W.1.17th June, 1966i.-3-
