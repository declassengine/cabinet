C(66) 6426th April, 1966CABINETREVIEW BODY REPORT ON DOCTORS^ AND dentists   jRE MUNERATIQNNote by th.e First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Economic Affairs and the Chancellor of the exchequer the Minister of Health&apos;s paper (C(66) 62) summarises therecommendations of the Kindersley Review Body on the pay of doctors and dentists as from 1st April, 1966, and asks for agreement to accept them.2,       We recognise that, as the paper says, any major departrre bythe Government from, these recommendations will carry a risk of massresignations amcngths medical profession and a breakdown of the health service.    On &quot;the other hand if we were to implement forthwith a pay increase of some 30 per cent for medical practitioners, it would beimpossible for trade unionists to believe that we are serious about theeconomic consequences of large increases in remuneration in 1966,particularly when it is recalled that these doctors had a 9 per cent increase a year ago.    Nor can we ignore the excessively high cost of implementing the recommendations at once (about  38 million a year).Therefore we have asked officials to list ways in which the cost in thectirrent year might be reduced;  a note is attached at Annex A.3.       We believe that the best alternative is the first - to accept therecommendations as they stand but to implement the increased payments to medical practitioners in two stages, so incurring half the extra costfrom 1st April, 1966, and the other half from 1st April, 1967.    This would still be far in excess of the 3j per cent norm but it would demonstrate that we are in earnest about our policy, and we believe public opinion would be on our side.    This would mean that the Government would beshowing a willingness to accept the Review Body&apos;s award in full as froma date in the reasonably near future, whilst still allowing all sectors ofthe dental and medical profession to have increases this year above thenorm.    Any other course would inevitably lead to severe criticism fromthose who, like the railwaymen, have been told that progress towardslonger term objectives which involve high costs to the Exchequer and thepossibility of repercussions on others, must be gradual.4.       We therefore invite our colleagues to agree to this two-stageimplementation for medical practitioners, ih view of the excessive costand incompatibility with incomes policy of the recommendations as they stand,G.B.i-f, J&quot;.

?M?^L JQPJJ^0RT-M PPATPM -MB.JMTISTS REMUNERATIONNote by officials the report&apos;s recommendations are intended to stand for two years from 1st April 1966,     The last general review took effect three years earlier.     Therefore 2.\ years (from mid-point to mid-point) at 3g&quot; per centgives a &quot;norm&quot; of 9 per cent,2.     The additional Exchequer co3t of the Review Body&apos;s recommendations(including superannuation) would be: m.Hospital doctors and dentists 7*general medical practitioners 23.general dental practitioners 3.3Superannuation, etc, ,J?T*P...,Total  37.9m.3.     The Review Body&apos;s view is that their 1963 recommendations wereovertaken by subsequent developments earlier than they had allowed for.Some increase over the&apos;horm&quot;would be justifiable on these grounds.A.     The recommendation for dentists, averaging 10.6 per cent over thetwo years, is not far above a &quot;norm&quot; of 9 per cent:   it seems acceptableafter allowing for the considerations mentioned in the preceding paragraph,5.     The average increase for hospital doctors is 13.4 per cent.     Thiscovers a wide range, from 35.4 per cent for&apos;pre-registration house officers to 9 per cent for top consultants.     The Health departments , evidenceproposed larger increases for junior doctors within a total consistent with incomes policy, so that the 13.4 per cent is the key figure.     As wellas the earnings of graduates and professional men in industry, the review body took account of increasing workload, and the need to maintain theattractiveness of the hospital service, particularly at junior levels.These considerations seem to justify an average increase of this order.6.     It is the increase recommended for general practitioners which posesthe main problem.     On the basis of the Review Body!s figures the average increase in net remuneration, including all the special payments, could beas high as 33 per cent.     If the new &quot;merit&quot; payments are excluded this figure would go down to 30 per cent;   and to 25 per cent allowing for otheradjustments mainly in respect of special incentive payments (Annex 2 of theMinister&apos;s paper).(1)150ANNEX A
7.     If Ministers were to decide that the recommendations for general practitioners were too high to he consistent with incomes policy then thereare the following alternatives to unqualified acceptance:(i)   Some or all of the main payments under the proposed system could he paid in instalments.     This could he done by accepting therecommendations in principle and implementing the payments intwo stages, from 1st April 1966 and 1st April 1967* so that halfthe extra cost of  23.9 million was incurred in 1966/67 and theother half not until the following year.     This might be done bydeferring until 1st April 1967 the introduction of senioritypayments and merit awards ( 7at) million), and reducing the sumof basic and supplementary practice allowance from  1,200 to 1,000 for the first year ( 4.4 million),(ii)   To cut the total cost, seniprdty^jja;yments ( 5.4 million) andmerit awards ( 2.1 million) could be deferred for the present,reducing the percentage increase figure by up to some 12 percent to something like the figure for hospital doctors.     Againthis would be arbitrary (these payments have been accepted inprinciple in the negotiations on the new system), and the profession would be almost certain to reject the report thusmodified.(iii)   Similarly, merit awards along could be deferred, cutting thepercentage increase by about 3 per cent ( 2.1 million a year).This would be less certain to offend the profession, who maywell themselves reject this item;   but it would be inconsistent with the Health Departments&apos; and Review Body&apos;s view that theproposal for merit awards is specially desirable,(iv)   The Health Departments&apos; evidence said that merit awards were a necessary complement to paym^ts^ for.. senility.     The Governmentcould maintain this view and refuse to make seniority paymentsunless the profession accepted merit awards,   - This would onlysave money if merit awards were then rejected by the profession.But the wording of the Review Body report opens the way to a reference back by the profession for seniority payments to beredistributed.     Although the Review Body said that if the profession rejected merit awards, &quot;we should recommend that themoney which would have been used should not be available, ratherthan that it should be distributed in other ways&quot;, the implication is that if the Government then rejected senioritypayments too, the Review Body might well want to recommend that money should be distributed in other ways.(2)
(v)   As a variant on (iv) to save money in the current year,seniority payments^andj^^ j*ga^^without retrospection when an acceptable scheme for the latterhas been negotiated.     But again this would conflict with anexplicit Review Body recommendation as to operative date andwould cause a row with the profession.(-,ri)   Saa&amp;larly. the whole svst^ai of new y&amp;viiieerita might only be^^l^entecTfrom a cjjry^r^date fpl^J^j^L.aLCAgPA^,?,6.,, Jffi ,ffiepjrojFession, which is unlikely before June;   an operative dateof 1st July would save a quarter of the annual extra cost, or some  6 million.     The alternative recommended by the review body, that the new payments should take effect from 1st April,would require retrospective adjustment of payments made at theold rates during thf, quarter, but there would be noadministrative difficulty in allowing for retrospection for thebulk of the payments involved,(vii)   This retrospective adjustment will however be difficult andinexact fort the new payments^ for items of service^.     To avoidhaving to pay a compounded sum based on the amount earned inthe following quarter, administrative simplicity could be gained(and something like  0.5 million saved) by deferring these payments to a current date following acceptance.     The questionhere is whether the relatively small gain is worth the risk ofprotests at rejection of one Review Body recommendation.22nd April,, 1966(3)
