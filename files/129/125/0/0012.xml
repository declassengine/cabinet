[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 62 COPY NO.     g y25th April, 1966CABINETDOCTORS&apos; AND DENTISTS&apos; REMUNERATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of HealthGeneralThe Review Body on doctors and Dentists&apos; Remuneration have reported to the Prime Minister on the remuneration to be paid todoctors and dentists in the National Health Service during the two year period from 1st April, 1966.    A copy of the report is attached.    Themain salary scales and fees recommended are listed in itsAppendices II and III.    We ask the Cabinet to agree that theGovernment should accept the recommendations as a whole.2.       The increased annual cost to the National Health Service,comparing the new gross remuneration with the old, is estimated at about  35 million (excluding consequential increases in employers&apos;superannuation contributions), or 15 per cent.    Details are given in annex A.    This compares with an estimated increased cost of about 77^ million or 33-g- per cent for the proposals submitted by the professions.3.       The total increase in net income involved is difficult to assessbecause of uncertainties regarding practice expenses and doubt whether all the new payments to general practitioners should beregarded as additional, but it is likely to amount to a minimum of alittle under 18 per cent, reflecting general economic developmentsover a period of about three years.    Different assumptions from thosewe have used about the uncertain factors (see paragraph 14 below)would lead to a higher percentage.4.       The report comes at a time of unease in the professions and ata critical stage in their relationship with the Health Service.    Thiscrisis of confidence has been most apparent among family doctors, huthospital doctors too, especially those in junior posts, have recentlybrought to public notice their discontent with current conditions and thedentists have asked for a complete review of the conditions of dentalpractice under the National Health Service.    Too many doctors areemigrating because they cannot see a satisfying future in this country as things stand, and those who remain are suffering the strain ofproviding services for a growing and increasingly health consciouspopulation in physical conditions which are often inadequate or worse,and which, as regards general practitioners, could under present arrangements often be improved only through financial sacrifice on thepart of the individual doctor himself.    All this goes well beyondremuneration, as the Review Body themselves recognise, butremuneration   is part of it and none of it can be ignored whenremuneration is considered,
The Review Body&apos;s Approach5.      Present remuneration of doctors and dentists is based on reccomendatons contained in the First Report of the Review Bodymade in 1963, as adjusted by intermediate reports.    The review body explain that because of the difficulty of foreseeing trends so far ahead and particularly because of the new basis adopted for the remuneration of general medical practitioners, they have now made recommendations to take effect from 1st April, 1966 and applicable,as suggested by the Government, for a two year and not a three year period.6.      The Review Body state that the factors taken into account toestablish the appropriate levels of remuneration for the two years Lfrom 1st April, 1966, include all the evidence (both the professions&apos;and their own information) on comparability, man-power, workloadand the distribution of d.octor3 between hospital and medical practice,as well as the considerations of prices and incomes policy.    Theyconsider that their previous recommendations were overtaken by events sooner than they had allowed for, so that the increase now recommended covers more than the two and a half years between the mid points of the previous and the present review periods.7.      They emphasise the difficulties of adopting comparability as a,basis for settling doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; remuneration and, although they have not ignored it as a factor, state that major considerations are the man-power situation in the professions and the weight of workand responsibility carried by doctors and dentists.8.      As to man-power needs the Review Body conclude that whilstyoung people are still attracted to medicine as a career, the national health Service is failing to hold the number of trained doctors required.Although there is no evidence that a career as a consultant in thehospital service is unattractive far too many junior doctors are beinglost.    A cause for still greater anxiety is the failure of the general medical service to attract enough young doctors and in particular theserious losses among those in the early years of a career in general practice.9.      As to workload in the hospital service the Review Body refer tothe fact that the turnover of in-patients has risen faster than the totalnumber of hospital medical staff since 1957 and conclude that the work-load must have increased at all levels and particularly among juniorgrades (who are required to work for very long hours).    In the general medical service they draw attention to the falling ratio of principals to total population, the fall in the number of assistants and the growth inthe number of very young and elderly patients.    They conclude that theaverage workload has increased in recent years and that for manydoctors it has increased considerably.10.      The Review Body emphasise that their recommendations are intended to recognise:-(i) the immediate need to reduce the loss of newly qualifieddoctors from the hospital service, to improve theattractiveness of the service in the junior grades and toreward increases of workload in these grades;-2-
the longer-term need to maintain the attractiveness of thehospital service as a career and to obtain the expansionenvisaged;(iii)the immediate need to increase admissions to and stemwithdrawals from the general medical service and toreward increasing workload;(iv)the longer-term need to promote and support remediesdesigned to make general practice an attractive andsatisfying career.General Medical Practitioners11.      The recommendations on general medical practitioners must beconsidered against the background of the Governments direct negotiations with this section of the profession over the last year.After the uproar touched off by the Review Body&apos;s report of25th january.ry, 1965. which led to the presentation of the Charter for the family Doctor Service, and the sending in of undated notices of resigna-tion, still in existence, from over 80 per cent of family doctors, the profession were with difficulty persuaded to limit the scope of direct negotiations with the Government to methods of payment and conditionsof service, and to leave levels of payment for consideration by the review Body.    It was only possible to achieve this by referring again and again to the independent status of the Review Body, the quality ofits members, and the weight that any Government must be bound togive to their views.    While the profession of course know that thefinal decision is for the Government we emphasised our full confidence in the Review Body and reminded the profession more than once that no government had failed to accept their advice.    In a letter to theChairman of the General Medical Services Committee on 16th March,1965, the draft for which was approved by the Cabinet (CC(65) 16thConclusions), the Minister of Health said &quot;I am sure we must continueto look to the Review Body for advice on levels of remuneration&quot;.12.      In the ensuing year the arrangements for general practice in the health Service have been completely recast, in an intensive series of meetings between representatives of both Health Departments and the profession.    We have worked out proposals not only for a new systemof remuneration which will be much more sensitive than the presentsystem to differences in circumstances and standards of practice butfor assisting and encouraging doctors in other ways to give the best possible service to their patients, including a finance corporation tomake loans for the provision of practice premises.    These proposalsrepresent a great step forward in general practice, constituting as theydo a significant reshaping, on the lines proposed by the Government, ofthe proposals originally put forward in the Charter.    The negotiations have engendered among the leaders of the profession a belief in theGovernments good faith and good intentions towards general practice.This new-found confidence, which could lead at last to a genuine partner-ship between Government and the medical profession, is as yet afragile thing and could all too easily be shattered.    It could never bere-established.    The profession as a whole has been unwilling to decide whether to accept the new arrangements until the contract has beenpriced, and it is indeed reasonable that the Government should first say what remuneration would attach to the new contract.    Acceptance of the review Body&apos;s recommendations on this, even though they fall well short
of what the profession themselves have claimed, is likely to satisfy thegreat majority of family doctors and thus to open the way to therevitalised general practice which is essential not only to the futureof the National Health Service but also to the future of general practiceitself.    Rejection or even substantial modification would certainly leadto mass resignations from the service and to emigration of many moreyoung doctors, and thus totally nullify our efforts of the past year andlose us this opportunity, perhaps the last, of putting general practice on the right road.    It would in fact probably mean the end of general practice as we know it: at best, recovery would be a long, bitter and costly business and the Government would be faced meanwhile withthe almost impossible task of finding a means of providing alternativeservices for the public.13.      This is the background for consideration of the Review Body&apos;srecommendations.    As requested by the Government and the profession the Review Body have expressed these in terms of the actualfees and allowances to be paid to practitioners instead of fixing, as previously; the average net income to be earned by all practitionerstaking part in the Service and leaving it to the Health Departments and representatives of the profession to agree upon the size of the &quot;pool ! of remuneration thus to be made available and the level of fees and allow-ances which this pool would sustain.14.      Any assessment of the increase in pay implicit in the review body&apos;s recommendations must thus rest in part on estimates of thenumber of fees and allowances to be paid in the future and, since someof these are entirely new items of payment and it is not possible to forecast precisely how many practitioners will qualify for them, the calculations may be subject to a substantial margin of error.    On thebest estimates possible it appears that the new fees and allowances would give practitioners collectively in 1966/67 nearly  24 million more than they would receive under the present pool system if the targetnet income were unchanged.15.      Not the whole of this sum should properly be reckoned as a payrise.    For such a reckoning, a more appropriate figure to take wouldbe about  16 million.    This represents 25 per cent of the estimatedcollective net income under the present system.    As explained in annex B, this is the figure arrived at after allowing for estimated under-reimbursement of expenses under the present system, for estimatedabnormal growth of expenses under the new system, and for the factthat some of the new payments cover aspects of general practice not previously recognised.    If these latter payments were included (otherthan merit awards, for which both the Review Body and the RoyalCommission on doctors and Dentists&apos; Remuneration have previously envisaged extra payments), the percentage would be 29.16.      The Review Body make it clear that they consider a pay increasewell above the norm to be justified for family doctors because of the increasing workload and the alarming loss of man-power which hasrecently begun to occur.    They consider that the increase they have recommended is within what can be regarded as reasonable andconsistent with incomes policy.    We agree, and can see no justification for a contrary view, quite apart from the disastrous consequences ofrejection to v/hich we have already referred.    Presentationally thedifficulty of making comparisons both with the past and with other professions and the fact that the Review Body have made a complete
reassessment of the situation should minimise any difficulties with other workers and the public.    The high increases will be directed to thosewhom it has been decided to single out for special treatment, many ofwhom have for years been subsidising a high standard of general practiceout of their own net income.    Indeed a considerable number of doctorsare likely to receive comparatively little additional remuneration.17.      The net additional cost to Votes in 1966/67 of implementing the review Body&apos;s recommendations for general medical practitioners isestimated at about  21-1 million (including just under  2 million forincreased employment of ancillary staff, which is not part of theincreased pay of the doctors themselves).    This is less than the figurementioned in paragraph 14 because some of the payments would be madequarterly in arrears.Hospital Doctors and Dentists18.      The overall increase in salaries, including certain increases inthe number and value of distinction awards, proposed for hospital doctors and dentists is about 13j per cent, but there is considerable variationamong grades.    For consultants - who number over two fifths of thestaff - the increase is broadly 10 per cent.    For those holding maximumdistinction awards, the increase is only 9 per cent.19.      Larger increases are, however, recommended for juniorhospital medical staff, ranging from 10 per cent for the registrar in hissecond year up to 35 per cent for pre-registration house officers (themost junior grade).    We have no doubt that substantial increases are justified for junior grades whose work involves long hours and exactingduties.    Public attention has recently been focussed on the discontentand grievance among these doctors.    A starting point of  1,100 perannum for a newly qualified doctor at age 24 or 25 cannot be regarded asunduly high.20.      The Review Body propose that doctors who are compulsorilyresident in hospital should not pay lodging charges and that others whoare resident should pay the economic charge, having regard to thestandard of accommodation.    All doctors, whether compulsorily orvoluntarily resident, should pay for meals taken in hospital.    The matter is referred for further discussion between the Health Departments and representatives of the profession in the light of the Review Bodyls proposalsGeneral Dental Practitioners21.      dentists remuneration is based on a target average net incomerecommended by the Review Body.    Fees for various items of treatment,providing also for the full reimbursement of expenses, are then worked out.    There is no definite figure for target net income for the whole ofthe last three-year review period.    The rate recommended in April, 1963was  2,740, but this was superseded by various intermediate recommenda-tions.    The rate recommended for the last six months of the period was 2,950.22.      The British Dental Association, in their evidence to the review body, suggested target net incomes of  3,745 and  3,818 for the twoyears of the new review period.    The Review Body&apos;s recommendation isthat for the year beginning 1st April, 1966 the target should be  3, 200and for the following year  3, 325, an increase of 8. 5 per cent and afurther 4.2 per cent respectively above the present target of  2,950.(This represents an average target for the two years of  3,262, 10.6 percent above the present target).
24.      We see no reason why the recommended increases, if accepted,should have any direct repercussions on claims for pay increases byother groups of staff in the National Health Service.    No other leadingprofessions rely almost wholly on the State for their livelihood andtheir professional opportunities.    Although we cannot assert thatcertain recommendations might not be used to support a claim for similar treatment by, say, the nurses, we would aim to resist any suchcomparison on the grounds that doctors constitute a special case.25.      It would be a very serious step indeed for the Government to reject or substantially modify the Review Body recommendations.    Animportant reason for setting up the Review Body was to avoid, in thewords of the Royal Commission, &quot;the recurrent disputes aboutremuneration which have bedevilled relations between the medical and dental professions and the Government for many years. &quot;   Refusal toaccept their recommendations would at once involve us in a much morebitter dispute than ever before, at a time when, as indicated inparagraph 2, relations between the professions and the Health service are already critical and would also almost certainly lead to the resigna-tion of the Review Body and thus leave us without any means of settlingdisputes with the professions about pay.    Even so, if the recommendations were manifestly indefensible in terms of incomes policy, the government might have to consider jeopardising the whole future of the national health Service by not accepting them; but we do not think that this isthe situation which faces us.    The increases proposed for hospital doctors as a whole, and for dentists seem to us to be modest in relationto the period which all the recommendations are intended to cover andthe exceptional increase, within this modest figure for all hospital doctors, for junior hospital staff, is amply justified by the specialconsiderations applicable to such staff.    Similarly the increase forgeneral medical practitioners, though high compared with the norm, isin our view fully justified by the considerations of workload and recruit-ment on which the Review Body dwell.    The recommendations as a wholeseem to us to strike the right balance between the different categories of staff, the higher increases for general medical practitioners andv- junior hospital doctors being offset by the much smaller increase for senior hospital staff and dentists, who are likely to regard theirincreases as well short of what is their due.    When we consider whatis at stake, and recognise that, for general practice at any rate, it isnot a matter of settling a pay increase but of whether or not thisessential service to the public is to be preserved at all, there can surelybe no doubt about our course of action.26.      We have had a preliminary discussion of the Review Body&apos;srecommendations with the First Secretary of State and the Chancellorof the Exchequer.    They do not dissent from them in principle butconsider that on financial and economic grounds the recommendations for general medical practitioners (paragraphs 13-15 above) should notinitially be implemented in full.    It is our firm view that any tamperingwith the recommendations would be unacceptable to the profession.    Inview of our insistence that the new contract for family doctors should be23.      The Review Body justify these increases on the grounds ofgeneral economic development since 1963 (as in the case of all their recommendations);  the need to stimulate the recruitment of dentalstudents which has lagged noticeably in the past year or so;  and theextent to which changes in the level of output should be taken intoaccount in the determination of target net income.Conclusions
-7-priced by the independent Review Body they will see refusal to acceptthe recommendations in full as a breach of faith.    They will feel thatthey have been singled out for arbitrary treatment and that, contrary tothe views of the Royal Commission on whose advice the Review Bodywas set up, their pay is being determined by considerations of politicalconvenience.    We have no doubt that the result would be the sendingin of the bulk of the 18, 000 resignations still held at BMA House, andthe loss of many young doctors not only from the Service but from britain, by emigration to overseas countries only too anxious to receive them.    Either the whole future of the Health Service and indeed of medical care would be put at risk or we should have to beat anignominious retreat.    Moreover, if there were mass withdrawals, weshould have to pay out this year between  60 million and  100 million in respect of superannuation and of compensation due under the national health Service Acts.    The remuneration of doctors leaving the service would be saved, but only from the date&apos; of withdrawal, and v/e should be bound to pay for medical care, and for drugs, in some form or another.The total cost to the Exchequer would certainly be higher than wouldacceptance of the Review Body&apos;s recommendations.    There would be no prospect of getting the doctors back into the National Health Service atany lower cost than that of acceptance and it would probably cost verymuch mere.27.      It may be argued that a minor modification of the award mightnot lead to these disastrous consequences.    But this is to ignore the doctors&apos; present mood.    Even if the modification were forced throughin the end, it would only be after bitter dispute and charges of breach of faith.    It is difficult to see that the financial and economic advantages ofany minor modification could possibly be such as to justify poisoningrelations with the profession in this way and running a serious risk ofthe far worse consequences, social and financial, described above.28.      There is in fact no alternative to full acceptance which could be both worthwhile in terms of financial and economic policy and acceptable to the profession.    We recommend that the Prime Minister should beinvited to announce as soon as possible that the Government have accepted all the Review Body&apos;s recommendations.    He could make itclear that the recommendations for general practitioners are of an order which the Government would not normally have found it possible to accept in present economic circumstances; and that they are doing so becauseof the special considerations regarding recruitment to, and workload in,general practice to which the Review Body refer, and because the recommended scale of fees forms an integral part of a completely newcontract negotiated between the Health Departments and the professionover the past year, which he believes will lead to a new era for general practice in this country,W.

CONFIDENTIAL a 6ANNEXBINCREASE IN NET INCOME ELEMENT IN RECOMMENDATIONS FORGENERAL PRACTITIONERSThe recommendations for general medical practitioners are interms of gross fees from which expenses must be met.    A calculation istherefore necessary to arrive at an estimate of increased net income.The total increase of  24 million referred to in paragraph 14 includes about 2 million for the payment of notional rents to doctors who own theirsurgeries (as distinct from renting them).    The Review Body consider it likely that the credit given to the pool for practice expenses in the pastincluded little or nothing for notional rents;  putting this right is therefore not an increase in the net incomes which was always intended.    Again,since the Review Body have recommended gross fees from whichpractitioners will have to meet their expenses (other than those which underthe new system will bo directly reimbursed) any increase in spending overand above that allowed for by the Review Body in their calculations will reduce the rise in net incomes.    The Review Body explain that they have allowed for an increase in average practice expenses at a compound annual rate of 4^ per cent but this may well be insufficient to cover abnormalexpenditure feat is likely to follow the introduction of the new contract anda substantial increase in the gross incomes of the practitioners themselves,e. g. consequential increases in the salaries which practitioners have topay their assistants, the cost of equipment and facilities for the additionalancillary helpers they are expected to employ, and a certain amount ofrefurbishing of surgeries, etc. - all of them items for which credit would automatically have been given under the pool system, thus ensuring thatthe expenditure did not have to be met from doctors intended net incomes.Again, the estimate of the total sum which would have been availablein the pool for 1966-67 is depressed, since the credit for expenses isbased on tax figures, by the withdrawal for tax purposes of the initialcapital allowances on private motor cars by virtue of the Finance Act,1965.    Doctors are unlikely to reduce their expenditure on cars - atleast to anything like the extent indicated by the withdrawal of the capitalallowance - and this is a further factor to be taken into account in assessing the increase in pay which they would receive.No precise figures can be put to these various factors but theyprobably result in the amount in the total of  24 million which shouldreckon as a pay rise being not much more than  20 million.Over  4 million of this reduced total of  20 million ie contributed by payments which the Review Body clearly regard as in a different category from a straightforward pay increase, namely, payments forspecial experience and service to general practice (a periphrasis fort&quot;merit awards&quot;) (over  2 million), payments to recognise vocational training ( y million), payments to doctors practising in groups ( 1 million), and payments for service in unat-ractive areas ( f million).The Review Body make the point that none of these payments are providedfor in the present system (except that the present arrangements for interest free group practice loans give some small financial advantage todoctors in groups) and consider that they should be &quot;strictly additional&quot;.As regards merit awards the Royal Commission which reported in I960recommended an extra  -f million for this purpose and the Review Bodysaid in their Fifth Report last year that they would be prepared torecommend a substantially greater sum to finance an agreed scheme.-9-
It can fairly be argued not only that merit awards are not provided forin the present system but also that the profession have chosen to forgoa considerable amount of remuneration under this head in the past.(It is by no means clear that the profession will agree to the introductionof merit awards even now, but the Review Body have made it clearthat in default of this they do not wish the additional remuneration forthis purpose to be made available for any other.)   The payment for vocational training is not dissimilar from the feature of many salarystructures under which new entrants with special qualifications arestarted at a point above the minimum of the scale.    And all thespecial payments mentioned, which will go to only a minority of doctors,cover aspects of general practice which the Review Body expressly sayhave not hitherto been recognised in the system of remuneration.While, therefore, they have not recommended that these payments should be made retrospectively it follows that they should not be takeninto account in assessing the increase in pay for doctors as a whole.After discounting the  4 million contributed by these specialnew payments the net increase for the generality of doctors is about 16 million, including over  5 million for seniority payments, which constitutes another new feature of the new contract.-10-

REVIEW BODY ON DOCTORS&apos; AND DENTISTS&apos; REMUNERATIONSEVENTH REPORTCHAPTER IINTRODUCTIONIn this report we submit the conclusions to which we have come and therecommendations which we make as the result of our second general review ofthe remuneration of doctors and dentists in the National Health Service.2. As a result of our first general review, begun in 1962, we submitted our first Report on 27th February 19631, recommending that the rates of remunera-tion of doctors and dentists from the National Health Service should be increasedby 14 per cent, with effect from 1st April 1963. We made clear our intention thatthe resulting new rates of remuneration should be likely to remain appropriate for a period, taken as a whole, of at least three years from that date. our recommendations were accepted and implemented.3. Our main concern in that first general review was to take account of developments since the Report of the Royal Commission on Doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; Remuneration2 which had affected all those with whose remunerationwe are concerned. The submissions put to us at the time were all in terms of ageneral increase to be applied to all groups and at all levels, and we were able toexpress our recommendations in terms of a single percentage rate of increase tobe applied to all the relevant figures. But even at that stage we were informed thatwe should in due course receive representations on behalf of certain particular groups, and subsequently we were asked to consider changes for particular groups within the general framework set by our 1963 recommendations.4. In 1964 and again in 1965 it became necessary to consider how the implementation of our 1963 recommendations was working out in relation to the remuneration of general dental practitioners, having regard to new information about dentists&apos; hours of work and also to changes in the level of output and in the structure of the profession since our First Report. Our Second Report3, dated10th December 1964, and our Sixth report, dated 13th July 1965, made further recommendations designed to bring about in the changed circumstances the results we had intended our 1963 recommendations to achieve. We were also asked to consider a claim in respect of senior hospital medical and dental officers1 The First Report was published in the Official Report, House of Commons, for 25th March1963.2 The Royal Commission^ Report was published as a Command Paper (Cmnd. 939) inFebruary 1960.3 The Second Report was published in the Official Report, House of Commons, for1st February 1965.4 The Sixth Report was published in the Official Report, House of Commons, for 5th August1965.
in the hospital service, which was the subject of our Third Report5, dated10th December 1964, and to consider proposals in relation to the numbersof distinction awards to be available for consultants in the hospital service, onwhich we made interim recommendations in our Fourth Report5, dated 25thJanuary 1965. Finally, we were asked to consider proposals for altering boththe amount and the system of remuneration for general medical practitioners.We made recommendations on these proposals in our Fifth Report5, dated25th January 1965. The recommendations in all these reports were accepted andimplemented, save that, since general medical practitioners were unable at that stage to agree to schemes for direct reimbursement of certain practice expenses,v it was not possible to act upon our suggestion that the additional moneyaccruing as a result of the recommendations in our Fifth Report should bedrawn upon so far as necessary to facilitate the introduction of the schemes inquestion, and the whole of the additional money was distributed in increasedcapitation fees.5. In all these reports after the First we were concerned with considerationspeculiar to particular groups of doctors and dentists, not with developmentscommon to all, and we did not take account of considerations which we regardedas falling within the scope of the type of general review which was the subject ofour First Report. Thus the subsequent reports revised the 1963 recommenda-tions in certain respects, but did not seek to re-examine them in the light ofgeneral economic trends and other developments.6. In March 1965, representatives of general medical practitioners put tothe Minister of Health, in a Charter for the Family Doctor Service, proposalsfor radical changes in the system and amount of remuneration of general medical practitioners. The Minister indicated his readiness to discuss proposalsfor the system with the profession^ representatives, but made it clear that hewould not be ready to agree to new levels of remuneration except on the recom-mendation of the Review Body. He did not see how new arrangements could bebrought into effect before the end of the period for which the Review Body&apos;s1963 recommendations were intended to last, but suggested that discussions should proceed so that new arrangements could come into effect at the beginningof a new review period.7. By May 1965 it was apparent that our 1963 recommendations (as modified by subsequent reports) could not be expected to last beyond March 1966, andwe decided to embark upon a second general review, in order that we might make recommendations to take effect (if accepted) for a new period starting from 1st April 1966. Invitations were accordingly sent to the Health Depart-ments and to the recognised evidence-giving representatives of the professions tosubmit memoranda of evidence by 30th September 1965. At the same time we made inquiries of our own, for the purpose of collecting information aboutlevels and movements of earnings of graduates in other professions and employ-ments. We collected information about earnings in other public services, in localauthorities and in publicly-owned industries; and we approached a number of professional institutions for information about earnings in professional practice.The Third, Fourth and Fifth Reports were published as a Command Paper (Cmnd. 2585)in February 1965.
We also invited nearly thirty companies, covering a wide range of industry and finance, to provide us in confidence with detailed information about earnings ofstaff with graduate or equivalent professional qualifications both accordingto their types of qualification and by age group. This inquiry produced informa-tion covering nearly 20,000 such staff, almost three times as many as werecovered by the similar inquiry made by the Royal Commission (referred to inparagraphs 95 and 96 of their Report). We should like to record our gratitude toall those who assisted us in these inquiries.8. We received all the main submissions of written evidence during november and early December. The Health Departments provided us with a memorandumon incomes policy and economic factors relating to the review of remuneration of the medical and dental professions, and the significance and implications of ithe prices and incomes policy were more fully expounded to us in oral evidenceby a representative of the Department of Economic Affairs. The Health Depart-ments also provided us with memoranda and gave oral evidence on the remunera-tion of hospital medical and dental staff and on the remuneration of general dental practitioners, and at our request provided additional factual and statistical information in writing. The Joint Evidence Committee of the British medical association and the Joint Consultants Committee submitted a memorandum;their representatives (including a representative of the Hospital Junior StaffsGroup Council of the British Medical Association) were invited to supplement the memorandum and answer questions in oral evidence. The British DentalAssociation provided a memorandum on the remuneration of general dental practitioners, and we invited their representatives to supplement thememorandum and answer our questions in oral evidence.9. We agreed that, since the proposals for general medical practitionerswere related to a radically altered system of remuneration, on this occasion the written and oral evidence concerning them should be taken separately fromthat on the remuneration of hospital doctors. We also agreed to depart in this instance from our usual procedure by accepting that the general practitioners&apos;case should on this occasion be presented by counsel. Through the summer wewere kept in touch with the progress of discussions between the Minister ofHealth and the representatives of general practitioners. As a result of these discussions a report containing proposals by the Government for a new systemof remuneration was issued to the profession. A ballot of the profession inOctober 1965 registered the view of a substantial majority of general practitionersthat the Governments proposals should be sent forward to us so that we couldrecommend levels of payment. Thereafter we received a memorandum ofevidence from representatives of the general practitioners, who were alsoinvited to supplement their memorandum and answer questions in oral evidence.The profession^ desire to be represented by counsel meant that on this occasion the main statement of their arguments and proposals came to us in their oral evidence rather than in their memorandum, which was little more than an out-line of some of the main features in their proposals. The general practitioners&apos;case was fully and clearly stated to us in the course of two long sessions of oral evidence. The Health Departments submitted a memorandum of evidence on ;general practitioner remuneration at the same time as the profession submittedtheirs, and were also invited to supplement their memorandum and answer questions in oral evidence.
10. We had the benefit of an opportunity to discuss with Lord Brain andSir John Macpherson, Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the committee whichadvises the Health Ministers on the allocation of distinction awards for con-consultants, questions arising on the numbers of these awards that should be madeavailable.11. In addition to this evidence provided in answer to our invitation(and a number of letters from individual doctors and dentists), we received amemorandum of evidence from the Hospital Junior Medical Staff ActionGroup. This Group was formed in September 1965 by a group of hospitaljunior medical staff who (in their own words) &quot; felt that recommendations should be sent to the Review Body on behalf of junior staff as they were uncertain whether the views of junior staff would adequately be represented in the evidence to be submitted by other organisations, of which they were not necessarilymembers or supporters &quot;. They informed us that their proposals were supportedby over six thousand signatures; this number would represent about half thetotal number in Great Britain of people in the hospital medical and dentalgrades covered by the Group&apos;s submission. At our request the Action Groupprovided answers in writing to certain questions which we put to them.12. In all we held twenty-three meetings between October 1965 and March1966 for the purpose of this review. We heard oral evidence at eight of these meetings.13. It will be seen from this account of the evidence we have received andthe procedure which we have followed that our task in this second general review has been very different from our task in our first general review. this time it was not simply a question of thinking in terms of a general percentage increase for all doctors and dentists in the National Health Service. We were asked to review the salary structure of hospital medical and dental staff indetail and to consider whether to recommend changes of relativities within the structure. For general medical practitioners we were not asked to determine anaverage net income for incorporation in the calculations relating to the pool,which is now to be brought to an end, but to determine a whole series of indi-vidual fees and payments in a new system of remuneration, allowing not only for net income but also for the reimbursement of practice expenses under new arrangements. We have also given further thought to problems in the system of remuneration for general dental practitioners which were first drawn to our attention at the time of our first review and have continued to be troublesomesince then. In the course of this review we have also had to consider more closely than before the relationship in earnings between the two main branchesof the medical profession, the hospital service and general practice. The RoyalCommission, six years ago, concluded that the overall relationship should remain broadly unchanged. Our review this time has led us to a differentconclusion.14. One further general point remains to be made. Since 1948 successiveHealth Ministers have been charged with a statutory responsibility for providinghealth services. The provision of the National Health Service, together withgreat developments of medical and dental knowledge and techniques and an increasing awareness among the general public of scientific advances in medicine
and dentistry, has led to a growing demand for medical and dental services. Asthe Government have recognised in The National Plan9, the demand on the health and welfare services will continue to grow with the increase in the popula-tion and improvements in standards of service. There is a deep concern in bothprofessions, and in the hospital service as well as in general practice, aboutthe present working of the National Health Service and the implications of growing demand, not just for the future of the National Health Service but also for the future of medicine and dentistry in this country and for those whopractise them. This is a matter that goes far beyond remuneration into problemsof the supply of places for training, the provision of facilities, the organisation of practice and other matters which are outside our sphere; indeed changes in remuneration will not solve the underlying problems or by themselves allay allthe concern which is evident in both professions. But remuneration is notirrelevant in this context. Bearing in mind that we are on this occasion under-taking a fundamental and wide-ranging review of medical and dental remunera-tion, we have tried to consider the problems of remuneration against this widerbackground, as well as in relation to the considerations and circumstances thatare immediately relevant.0 The National Plan, Cmnd. 2764 (published in September 1965), Chapter 20.
CHAPTER IIPERIOD COVERED IN REVIEW15. In their report the Royal Commission stated that in the professionalfield frequent changes of remuneration were not customary, and in their viewwere not desirable. They did not think that any attempt should be made tokeep doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; remuneration closely in step with every change inthe earnings of comparable groups or in the cost of living. They suggested thatwe should normally propose adjustments at relatively infrequent intervals, andthese adjustments should be expected to keep the position stable for sometime, so that in the period immediately before a review doctors&apos; and dentists&apos;remuneration might be lower than its &quot; right&quot; level at that time, but imme-diately after a review it might well be above its &quot; right &quot; level. They suggestedthat the aim should be to keep remuneration stable for periods of at least threeyears if possible7.16. This was the system we followed at our first review, if only (as we saidat the time) because we were invited by the Health Departments and the pro-confessions to do so. It has difficulties, as we pointed out in our First Report. it means that at each review we must look backward as well as forward: backwardto decide at what point in the last three years the current levels of remunerationwere &quot; right&quot;, and forward to assess what increases are required to bringremuneration up to a level which will be &quot; right&quot; over the next three years.Three factors have to be weighed. First, developments in the first part of theprevious period must be examined, to see whether they ran according to the expectations on which the previous review was based. Second, allowance hasto be made for further developments between the point at which currentremuneration is now considered to have been &quot; right&quot; and the time of the review. Third, future developments have to be envisaged so as to allow forwhatever further change is needed to bring remuneration to a level which will be right for the forthcoming period as a whole. The last part of this process isparticularly problematic.17. In principle we share the Royal Commission^ view that frequentchanges of professional remuneration are not desirable. For this reason, and because of the objections (which we discuss in Chapter III) to relying solely orprimarily on comparisons as a basis for determining medical and dentalremuneration, we have not adopted the proposal put to us by the HospitalJunior Medical Staff Action Group for annual increases based on general economic trends and triennial&quot; revaluation &quot; reviews based on fair comparisons,on the pattern of the non-industrial civil service with its annual general pay increases and periodic pay research reviews for particular classes.18. The representatives of hospital medical and dental staff and of general dental practitioners formulated their written evidence to us on the assumptionthat our recommendations would relate to a further period of three years, from&apos; Cmnd. 939, paragraph 437.
1966 to 1969. At an early stage in our review, however, our minds were moving towards a shorter period; and we found our views confirmed by the health departments, who suggested that on this occasion our review should cover aperiod of two years. We have decided to adopt this suggestion, which we under-stand to be acceptable to the recognised representatives of the professions, forthree main reasons.19. From 1963 to 1965 the general level of money incomes rose at a fasterrate than we anticipated and a considerably faster rate than we think the RoyalCommission expected. Although it may be hoped that the prices and incomes policy will succeed in keeping the growth of money incomes within the long-term rate of growth of productivity in future, it has to be recognised that thecomplete fulfilment of the objectives of the policy may take some time. Ifincomes are rising at the rate experienced in this country in the last two or threeyears, incomes that are adjusted only once every three years can becomeseriously out of line, and when the time comes for an adjustment it may haveto be relatively large: this may create misunderstandings in the minds of thosewho do not appreciate that the incomes policy &quot; norm &quot; of 3 to 31 per cent, forthe average rate of growth in money incomes is an annual rate. In the medicalarid dental professions infrequency of adjustment at such times tends to bearparticularly hardly on the junior hospital doctors (in whose salaries, particularly at present levels, there can be little or no margin within which to absorb changesin the cost of living). It also affects salaried hospital doctors and dentists whosesuperannuation benefits are based on final salary and who retire just before a review. This is the first reason for adopting a shorter review period on this occasion.20. The other two reasons are peculiar to general medical and dental practitioners and to this occasion. At this review we are recommending levels of awhole range of payments for general medical practitioners under a new systemof remuneration. On some of these payments there is inevitably little or no firminformation derived from experience to guide us. There is thus an element ofexperiment in the levels of payments as well as in the system. The Governmentand the profession^ representatives contemplate a full review of the systemafter an appropriate period they suggest five years to enable a consideredjudgment of its effectiveness to be arrived at. We should like to have an opportunity -unity of reviewing the levels of payment a good deal sooner than that, wheninformation is available about the results of the first year&apos;s working of thesystem. We have also been informed that discussions are to take place betweenthe Health Departments and the British Dental Association on the system of remuneration for general dental practitioners; the Health Departments proposethat we should be kept in touch with the progress of these discussions, as wehave been kept in touch with the discussions on the system of remuneration forgeneral medical practitioners. It may be convenient that the introduction of any changes in the system that result from these discussions should coincide with ageneral review, though we do not rule out the possibility of their being introduced in between reviews. From both these points of view three years seems too longto wait for the next general review.21. We have therefore decided to formulate all our recommendations onthis occasion with the intention that the resulting rates should stand for a period
of two years from 1st April 1966, and should be appropriate for that periodtaken as a whole.22. We have regarded it as our main task to fix rates of remunerationwhich will be right for the new period, taking into account all the relevant factors,not simply to adjust existing rates and structures for general economic develop-ments since we last reported. In so far, however, as our recommendations are intended to take account of general economic developments amongst other factors and to replace our 1963 recommendations (as modified in some cases bylater reports), we think that they should be looked at in the light of the following considerations:(i) We think that our conclusions in February 1963 were about right in sofar as they related to developments between 1960 and that date, butsomewhat underestimated developments thereafter. We conclude thatour 1963 recommendations were overtaken by events earlier than weallowed for.(ii) In deciding what allowance to make for developments since the point at which the 1963 recommendations were overtaken, we have felt bound to take some account of the general movement of money incomesbetween then and now. We have felt that it would be wrong in principle,as well as inconsistent with statements by successive Governments andby the National Board for Prices and Incomes, that doctors and dentistsshould be penalised because their remuneration is reviewed lessfrequently than many other people&apos;s.(iii) The recommendations in this report are intended to stand for a periodof two years from 1st April 1966.23. It follows from the first of the above considerations that, if our recom-mendations are being thought of in relation to a period of time, the period should be longer than the two and a half years that will have elapsed between themidpoints of the 1963-66 and the 1966-68 review periods. But that is only partof the story. Many other considerations have had to be taken into account as wereviewed the problems of the various groups with whose remuneration we areconcerned and decided what recommendations to make for the next two years.
CHAPTER IIIECONOMIC FACTORS AND COMPARABLE EARNINGS24. The submissions put to us by the professions rested, explicitly orimplicitly, on the views expressed by the Royal Commission in recommending the terms of reference with which a standing Review Body should be set up:&quot; We do not think it desirable to define exactly the factors of which the review Body should take account in making its recommendations. Itwould be presumptuous on our part... to seek to tie their hands for years ahead in circumstances of which we are not at present aware. While itshould be left to them to decide which factors might be relevant at anyparticular time and the weight to be attached to them, we expect that three factors which would always be relevant would be changes in the cost ofliving, the movement of earnings in other professions, and the quality and quantity of recruitment in all professions.&quot;825. The Health Departments and the Department of Economic Affairs drewour attention to the point made in the White Paper on Prices and IncomesPolicy9, that changes in the cost of living and comparisons with levels or trendsof incomes in other employments were among the factors to which less weightwould have to be given than hitherto if wages and salaries were to keep in step with the long-term rate of increase in national productivity, and to the criteria for exceptional increases in wages and salaries which were set out in paragraph15 of the White Paper:&quot; (i) where the employees concerned, for example by accepting moreexacting work or a major change in working practices, make a directcontribution towards increasing productivity in the particular firm or industry. Even in such cases some of the benefit should accrue to thecommunity as a whole in the form of lower prices;(ii) where it is essential in the national interest to secure a change in thedistribution of manpower (or to prevent a change which would other-wise take place) and a pay increase would be both necessary and effective for this purpose;(iii) where there is general recognition that existing wage and salary levelsare too low to maintain a reasonable standard of living;(iv) where there is widespread recognition that the pay of a certain group ofworkers has fallen seriously out of line with the level of remuneration for similar work and needs in the national interest to be improved.&quot;Without themselves putting forward any figures for new levels of remuneration for doctors and dentists, the Departments recognised that for general medical practitioners considerations of manpower and workload might justify some increase above the average annual rate of 3 to 31 per cent, which the White8 Cmnd. 939, paragraph 431.9 Cmnd. 2639, published April 1965.
Paper takes as the norm for the growth of money incomes related to the long-term rate of growth of national productivity. They took the view that there wasno case for an increase of more than this norm for general dental practitionersor for hospital medical and dental staff as a whole, though they thought that within the overall increase for hospital medical and dental staff there should be larger increases for junior staff than at the higher levels.26. The professions did not suggest that their remuneration should besettled without regard to general economic considerations. They drew our attention, however, to one of the factors that led the Royal Commission torecommend the appointment of a standing Review Body:&quot; The second aim is to give these two professions, most of whose membersderive the greater part of their livelihood from the National health service, some assurance that their standards of living will not be depressedby arbitrary Government action. It may sometimes be expedient to avoidincreased expenditure on the remuneration of people paid from public funds; it may be tempting to describe this as an economic necessity or inthe national interest. While clearly the Government of the day mustgovern, doctors and dentists must have some confidence that their remuneration will be settled on a just basis.&quot;10The representatives of the professions urged us not to recommend levels of remuneration that were lower than we might otherwise think fair and reasonablebecause of the exigencies of a particular current economic or fiscal situation,arguing that it was for the Government to deal with those problems, and to adjust programmes of public expenditure according to their views of economicand social priorities. The professions&apos; representatives suggested that it would be both unfair and undesirable that ground which they submitted had been lost bydoctors and dentists in relation to other professions should not be recoveredbecause of the relative infrequency of reviews of their remuneration and becausethe present review coincided with a particular phase of incomes policy. They also suggested that their proposals to us were justified in terms of the criteria for exceptional increases set out in the White Paper, and in particular by evidence which they put before us to show that their earnings had in the last nine yearsfallen (in the words of the White Paper) &quot; seriously out of line &quot; with earnings inother professions, by the inability of some to maintain a reasonable standard ofliving on present earnings, by the need to sustain recruitment and reducewastage of doctors and dentists and by the increased workload and responsibility which they were being asked to carry.27. We were supplied in evidence with information on changes in the cost ofliving, as reflected in the index of retail prices. It was not argued that the remuneration of doctors and dentists generally had failed to keep pace with thecost of living in the last fifteen years. It was, however, argued by the HospitalJunior Medical Staff Action Group that the current salary levels of juniorhospital doctors were substantially too low because the salary rates fixed in1948, at the outset of the National Health Service, on the basis of recommenda-tions by the Spens Committee which had been expressed in terms of 1939money values, did not make nearly enough allowance for changes in moneyvalues between 1939 and 1948. We have not sought to pursue this line of
reasoning. The Spens Committee in any case made no recommendations for house officers, and at this distance of time it would be difficult, if not impossible,to say what considerations led those concerned to fix salary rates as they did in1948. More important, we think that the time has now passed when the recom-mendations of the Spens Committees, reporting in 1946 and 1948, can be relied on as a guide to levels of remuneration. We have to consider what is appropriate in present circumstances.28. The Royal Commission^ recommendations were based upon theconclusions which their terms of reference required them to reach as to theproper levels of remuneration of doctors and dentists from the National health service by comparison with earnings of other doctors and dentists and in other professions and connected occupations at the time of their appointment in1957. Comparisons with movements of earnings in other professions andemployments since then were the main basis of the increases proposed to us by the professions for hospital medical and dental staff and for general dental practitioners; they were also relied upon as one of the arguments in support ofthe proposals put to us by the representatives of general medical practitioners.The arguments on comparisons are of general application to the considerationof medical and dental remuneration, and can best be discussed in a generalcontext. The professions&apos; case on comparisons was most fully deployed in theevidence presented by the Joint Evidence Committee on behalf of hospital medical and dental staff. For convenience we base our discussion on theirpresentation; the general drift of the argument by the British Dental association was similar and our general comments (though not all the detailed points)apply to that also. Because much of the weight of the professions&apos; case rested onthe conclusions they had drawn from the evidence they had collected on move-ments of salaries and earnings in other walks of life, we have thought it right todeal with their evidence and arguments with great care and in detail. In this chapter we set out our views and conclusions on this, and we mention some ofthe general issues that arise in considering the implications for decisions onremuneration of questions of manpower and workload. In later chapters of thereport we discuss in more detail the evidence we have collected and the views wehave formed on the manpower position and workload situation in the hospital services and in the general medical and dental services.29. The Joint Evidence Committee stated that they fully accepted theconclusions reached on general practitioner remuneration by Mr. (now Lord)Justice Danckwerts in 195211, and the conclusions reached by the Royal Corn-mission in so far as they were based upon the evidence collected by the RoyalCommission relating to professional earnings in 1955-56; they thus acceptedthe Royal Commission^ conclusion that average earnings of doctors and dentists for the whole career period between ages 30 and 65 should have been about  7,000 more in 1957 than they were in 1955-56. They considered, how-ever, that the Royal Commission&apos;s further adjustment of 12 per cent, to bringthe 1957 figures of career earnings up to date for the period from 1960 to 1963was inadequate, and that the Review Body&apos;s recommendation in 1963, thoughit allowed for the Review Body&apos;s conclusion that the rates of remunerationrecommended by the Royal Commission had been overtaken much earlier than11 See Cmnd. 939, paragraphs 52 to 55.
the Royal Commission had expected, had none the less failed to bring medical and dental remuneration for the period from 1963 to 1966 back into line withthe incomes of the other professions in the Royal Commission^ survey at the levels regarded as appropriate by the Royal Commission.30. The Royal Commission expressed their view on the appropriate levels of earnings in the medical and dental professions in 1957 in terms only of average career earnings, not of salary scales or points. In order to arrive atnotional salary scales for hospital medical and dental staff in terms of what they thought that the Royal Commission would have regarded as appropriate in1957, the Joint Evidence Committee deducted 12 per cent, from the scalesactually recommended by the Royal Commission for introduction in 1960. Theycompared these notional 1957 scales with the scales introduced after our 1963review, and found that the 1963 scales were higher than their notional 1957scales by 28 per cent, (our 14 per cent, compounded with the Royal Com-mission&apos;s 12 per cent.), which was equivalent to a cumulative annual increase ofabout 31 per cent, over the period of about seven and a half years from early1957 to the midpoint of the three years beginning on 1st April 1963.31. They contrasted this with a cumulative average annual increase of5J per cent, in gross domestic product per head of the working populationover eight years between 1957 and 1965; with a cumulative average annual increase of nearly 5f per cent, in the index of average earnings of salariedemployees over the nine years from October 1955 to October 1964; and withcumulative average annual increases between 1957 and 1963 of 5  per cent, and5 per cent, for incomes of  2,000 and  3,000 respectively in 1957 (deduced fromcomparisons of numbers of incomes in successive income-brackets in variousyears appearing in the annual statistics of national income and expenditure).They also compared figures of earnings in 1955-56 in certain other professionsincluded in the Royal Commission^ survey with figures of earnings in the sameprofessions in various years between 1962 and 1965 derived from later inquiries,to arrive at cumulative average annual increases ranging from 5.9 to 8.0 percent. They also quoted changes of certain civil service salaries (including thoseof a number of professional grades) from various dates between 1956 and 1959to various dates between 1963 and 1965, to show cumulative average annual increases ranging from 4.2 per cent, at the highest salary levels to 6.9 per cent,at the  1,500 level (in 1958 terms).32. The representatives of the Joint Evidence Committee accepted thatthe detailed evidence they had collected was of varying degrees of statisticalvalidity and relevance to medical and dental remuneration, but they submitted that the general picture that it presented was clear and unmistakable. Theyconcluded that &quot; a reasonably conservative estimate of the general increase insalaried and professional incomes comparable to the medical profession is, 5f per cent, a year, except that at the level of about  3,000 in 1957 an increase of5  per cent, is more appropriate &quot;. Starting from their notional 1957 salarylevels, projecting forward at these rates of increase to the middle of a period ofthree years from April 1966 (on the assumption that our recommendations would relate to such a period), and supplementing the results at the lowest levels of hospital doctors&apos; salaries in the light of direct comparisons with startingsalaries in other employment, they proposed new salaries ranging from  1,200
for the salary of a house officer in his first (pre-registration) year (comparedwith  812 today: an increase of  388 or about 48 per cent.) to  5,950 for themaximum of the consultant scale (compared with  4,445 today: an increase of 1,505 or about 34 per cent.).33. A number of detailed difficulties complicate the analysis of this informa-tion and suggest some reservations on the conclusions. Gross domestic productper head seems to us to be a doubtfully appropriate indicator to choose for thispurpose. The index of average earnings of salaried employees is dominated bytechnical and clerical workers, at lower salary levels than many doctors and dentists. The figures on distribution of incomes at various levels include income from investments. Moreover, they are revised substantially from time to time,and the technique of deducing income changes from them is by no meansprecise.34. There must be reservations also about the detailed figures for move-ments of earnings in other professions. While the Royal Commission^ surveyswere conducted simultaneously and uniformly, with elaborate procedures foreliminating sampling errors and other distortions, and were analysed by age inorder to produce information on career earnings, the later inquiries quoted bythe Joint Evidence Committee were conducted at various times by variousdifferent bodies, were related to different (and not necessarily representative)populations, were not always surveys by questionnaire, and generally speakingdid not provide material from which career earnings could be calculated. So faras the civil service salaries are concerned, some confusion arose from thedifferent ranges of dates chosen: when the movements for the same grades are taken for the period from 1st April 1956 to 1st October 1964, the cumulativeaverage annual increases range from 3-8 to 5-9 per cent.35. The method by which the Joint Evidence Committee arrived at notional1957 salaries for hospital doctors and dentists from the Royal Commission^recommendations for the period from 1960 is open to question. Paragraph 170of the Royal Commission^ Report makes it clear, not only that their calculationsof the appropriate increases from 1955-56 to 1957 and again from 1957 to 1960were in terms of average career earnings, but also that they decided that withinthe average figures younger doctors should receive rather higher percentage increases. They give no indication of what percentage figures they had in mindat different salary levels (unless the figures in paragraph 136 are to be soregarded), but it clearly follows that to deduct a flat 12 per cent, from all the1960 salary levels is liable to give too high an answer at lower salary levels andtoo low an answer at higher salary levels.36. A more serious criticism relates to the choice of 1957 as a base date forthe figures on medical remuneration. The publication of the Royal Commission&apos;sReport, with its comprehensive surveys of earnings in 1955-56 in other pro-confessions and its recommendations for doctors and dentists, led to &quot; catching up &quot;increases in some other professions. If the Royal Commission considered thatdoctors and dentists were underpaid in 1955-56, some other professions took theview that the Royal Commission^ findings showed that they too were underpaidat that time. Movements of earnings between 1955-56 and points between 1962and 1965, of the kind given in the Joint Evidence Committee&apos;s evidence, must beconsidered in this light. Moreover, by taking notional salary levels in 1957 as the
starting line for hospital doctors, the Joint Evidence Committee left out of the reckoning that portion of the increases recommended by the Royal commission which was designed to bring the 1955-56 average career earnings up to a levelappropriate in 1957. A comparison of the movement of hospital doctors&apos; salariesbetween 1st April 1954 (the date of the introduction of the scales in force in1955-56) and 1st April 1964 (a year after the introduction of the 1963 scales, andthus hot far from the middle of the review period that is now coming to an end)shows cumulative average annual increases over the ten years ranging from 3 per cent, at the consultants maximum to 5 per cent, for the registrar and 6 percent, for the house officer. We offer these figures for the purpose of illustrationonly, not because we are arguing that the salaries were &quot;. right &quot; at 1st April 1954.37. Three major difficulties thus bedevil any attempt at comparisons of movements of incomes. The first is that comparisons between one group andanother can vary greatly according to the base dates chosen. The second is thedifficulty of being sure that like is being compared with like. The third is thedanger of &quot; leapfrogging &quot;, when increases in earnings in one sector are used tojustify comparable increases in earnings in another sector, which in turn areprayed in aid of a further increase in the first sector &quot; to restore comparability &quot;.The potential inflationary effect of this process is plain.38. Two of these difficulties can be illustrated by one example taken fromthe Joint Evidence Committee&apos;s submissions to us. One of the other professionsto which reference was made was that of university teachers, where the medianincome (all ages) in the Royal Commissions survey ( 1,380 in 1955-56) wascompared with median earnings from a recent survey by the Association of university Teachers ( 2,318 in 1964-65), to show an increase of 68 per cent., or-9 per cent, a year compound, in nine years. This illustrates first the difficulty ofcomparing results from two separate surveys. Like is not being compared withlike: the Royal Commission^ survey covered all professional earnings of university teachers, while the survey by the Association of University Teacherscovered only the teachers&apos; salaries from their own universities. If the twosurveys had covered the same range of earnings, the comparison would probably have shown a higher annual rate of increase unless of course there were otheroffsetting factors to allow for. This example also illustrates the danger of leap-frogging. The increase in university teachers&apos; earnings in this period included the substantial salary increases recommended in March 1964 by the. national incomes Commission because they had found that the existing salaries were&quot; not adequate to enable the universities and colleges of advanced technologyto recruit and retain sufficient staff of the calibre necessary to maintain theirhigh academic standards &quot;. The Commission expressly stated that the main object of their recommendations was to put the universities and colleges in a, position from which they would be able to compete on terms with other claim-mants for the limited number of persons of high academic ability12. If the remuneration of the medical and dental professions, recruiting in the samemarket, were now to be increased by an amount which reflected the whole of the1964 increases for university teachers, the competitive position of the universitiesin relation to the medical and dental professions would presumably be to that extent worsened and the object of the National Incomes Commission^ recom-National Incomes Commission, Report no. 3 (Cmnd. 2317), paragraph 213.14
mendations frustrated. Before putting forward a recommendation which had that effect, one would need to be very sure that a comparison of current recruit-ment needs and experience for university teachers on the one hand and for themedical and dental professions on the other justified it.39. Bias arising from choice of varying base dates and the risk of &quot; leap-frogging &quot; may be to some extent, though not entirely, avoided by comparingcurrent levels rather than trends of remuneration for jobs which have a strongfunctional resemblance to each other. This is the basis of the system of &quot; faircomparisons &quot; which has been used for determining pay in the non-industrial civil service. But a system based on what the Armitage Committee on the Pay ofPostmen described as &quot; functional comparisons &quot; is not feasible in our field,because there are no jobs in this country that can be regarded as functionallycomparable with those of doctors and dentists in the hospital service or ingeneral practice.40. The Hospital Junior Medical Staff Action Group put to us a suggestionthat we should recommend the appointment of an organisation like the CivilService Pay Research Unit to assist us by collecting information about changesin the cost of living and earnings in other professions. We think that thisproposal misconceives the main function of the Civil Service Pay Research Unit.That is to analyse in terms of function and responsibility both jobs in the civilservice and jobs in outside organisations, with a view to establishing whetherand to what extent the outside jobs are functionally comparable with the civilservice jobs. Where they conclude that an outside job is broadly comparable with a civil service job, they say so, drawing attention to any special factors which supplement or complicate the comparison. They also provide details ofthe remuneration and conditions of service attached to the outside job. If theonly requirement were to collect this information, it would not need a pay research Unit to do it; their function is that of identifying comparable jobs. Ifthere were any chance of finding other jobs which were functionally comparable with those of doctors and dentists in the hospital service and in general practice,there would be something to be said for setting up a Pay Research Unit toadvise us on the job comparisons. If the task is to seek information aboutearnings in other professions and employments we can do that for ourselves.41. We have in fact collected a considerable amount of information aboutcurrent levels of earnings of graduates and others with equivalent professional qualifications in the public services, in other professions and in industrial andfinancial concerns for the purposes of this review, and the professions&apos; evidenceincludes a certain amount of similar information. We have already discussed thedifficulties of analysing and collating such limited information as is available about current earnings in other professions. It must be recognised that there isno hope of securing figures of the same breadth and authority as those obtained by the Royal Commission without repeating their comprehensive survey oradopting their recommendation about the use (subject to safeguards againstdisclosures of information about the affairs of individuals) of material availableto the Inland Revenue13. The only conclusion we have been able to draw fromthe information available to us on current levels of earnings in other professionsis the negative one, that it does not establish that medical and dental earnings are as a whole substantially lower than they should be. But the information does
not take account of other factors which may be held to justify an improvementin the earnings of doctors and dentists.42. Our inquiries about earnings of graduates and those with equivalentprofessional qualifications in industry provided us with valuable information about levels in 1965 and movements since 1960 of earnings in industrial and commercial employment at levels comparable with medical and dental remunera-tion. Earnings in this sector can be presumed to be further removed from theinfluence of the Royal Commission^ findings than earnings in the professions.This information covers the same categories of persons as those covered by theRoyal Commission^ similar inquiries on earnings in 1955-5614 and has the sameadvantages as regards reliability. Since the statistics were supplied in age-groupsit was possible to derive a figure for average career earnings between the ages of30 and 65, and hence the age-corrected average annual earnings over that range of years. The resulting figure was approximately  3,250. This was about 35 percent, greater than the 1955-56 figure from the Royal Commission&apos;s inquiry.The information about movements of earnings since 1960 is less easy to interpret,but our inquiry appears to suggest that earnings of graduates and men withequivalent professional qualifications in industry at levels up to about  3,000in 1960 rose at an annual rate of 3 to 3J per cent, between 1960 and 1963, and atan annual rate of about 5 per cent, (or a little more at the lowest levels) between1963 and 1965. For salaries of  5,000 and above in 1960 the increases over theperiod appear to have been somewhat less.43. In interpreting the information on levels of earnings in industry three points must be borne in mind:(a) Some of the companies in our inquiry did not include salaries paid to full-time directors in their returns.(b) The figures of earnings in our inquiry mostly excluded &quot; fringebenefits &quot;, on which we sought and obtained separate information.This did not give us any reason for differing from the Royal Com-mission&apos;s finding that, as regards additional benefits, doctors and dentists might be about level on average with the whole group of graduates in industry, though industry might be better placed thandoctors and dentists in the top ranges of salary levels.18(c) Account has also to be taken of superannuation contributions and benefits. Our inquiry provided us with information on current super-annuation contributions and benefits in relation to salary levels in industry, and led us to the conclusion that in general hospital doctors and dentists are not at a disadvantage in this respect, though this is notto say that it would be impossible to find instances of superannuationprovisions in industry either more or less generous than those for hospital doctors and dentists.16Allowing for all these points, however, the extent of the coverage of our inquiry and the reliability of the figures have made it an important element in the11 Cmnd. 939, paragraphs 95 and 96.10 Cmnd. 939, paragraph 147.10 Some difficulty has arisen in the case of general medical practitioners because superannuationbenefits are calculated in terms of career-average earnings, and are therefore liable to fail to make sufficient allowance for the erosion of money values by inflation; but we understandthat the Health Departments have made proposals to the profession^ representatives foralterations to the system of calculating benefits with a view to meeting this difficulty withoutrequiring any increase in contributions.
evidence on which our review has been based, to be taken into account along with information on professional earnings and earnings in other public services.44. We have discussed the difficulties of adopting comparability as a mainbasis for settling doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; remuneration. We do not mean by this tosuggest that we have ignored comparability as one element in the process of reaching decisions on this subject, or that we have dismissed as irrelevant orentirely without substance the arguments and evidence put before us. It would be convenient to be able to adopt the general point of view put to us by the health departments, that the Royal Commission^ recommendations in 1960 wereright and were accepted by both sides, that our recommendations in 1963 wereright and were accepted by both sides, and that we are called upon to do no more than take account of trends since our first general review. We have not felt able to take so limited a view as that: we must be prepared to think it possible that we and the Royal Commission were mistaken, as well as to take account of the many developments of various kinds since 1963. We are, however,saying that we cannot accept on grounds of comparability alone increases of the magnitude proposed to us by the professions, and that assessments of other factors, such as the manpower situation in the professions and the weight ofwork and responsibility carried by doctors and dentists, must be major consi-derations for us to take into account in making up our minds.45. We reserve detailed discussion of these matters in relation to eachprofession in turn for later parts of this report. One or two general points canhowever be made here, because they have some bearing on the weight to beattached to general economic trends and comparisons with other incomes.46. In any profession or employment those responsible for determiningremuneration have to take account of a combination of economic and socialconsiderations. Arguments on comparability are perhaps primarily directed tothe social considerations; it is arguable that, if one is thinking in terms of whatis economically justifiable, the direct evidence of experience in the recruitment and retention of staff is a better indicator of ability to compete in the market formanpower, and therefore of the adequacy of the level of earnings, than com-comparisons of earnings. This argument would doubtless have much force if one wasdealing with a type of employment where the mobility, or at least the inter-changeability, of labour was high. We think, however, that it would be bothdangerous and unjust to apply this principle too rigorously to the situation ofprofessions like medicine and dentistry. The training required to practice in either profession is very long. The health services are by far the largest users of medical and dental manpower, and opportunities for employment of doctors and dentists in this country outside the health services are limited (thoughmedically and dentally qualified manpower is much in demand overseas).In both professions the sense of vocation, of service to the community andloyalty to the profession, is long established. In these circumstances evidence ofuncompetitiveness in the market for the limited supply of suitable manpowermay be slow to appear; if we may allow ourselves a medical metaphor, by thetime the symptoms become statistically apparent and measurable, the disorderwhich they represent may have existed for some time and developed some way,and may not be easily or quickly or cheaply remedied. Here comparisons of earnings may have a greater part to play than in some other types of employ-
ment, not necessarily as direct evidence of inadequacy of remuneration, but as early warning signals of the need to consider whether remuneration is adequate and to be watchful for more definite manifestations of uncompetitiveness.47. Another facet of the economic considerations that enter into the deter-mination of remuneration is change in the output per fiead of the peopleconcerned. Where output can fairly be measured in statistical terms, it is notdifficult to assess what the increase in output per head and the resulting effects on costs per unit of output have been, though there remains the problem of deciding how the benefit accruing should be distributed as between the work-people, the entrepreneurs and the customers. It is more difficult to assess the significance of changes of output per head in a service where output cannot soreadily be measured. We heard much in evidence about the increasing workloadon hospital doctors and on general practitioners, and the developments in medical technique and equipment which have made the work in many waysmore exacting. We shall be examining this evidence in more detail later. Here itsuffices to say that some of the return from these changes and developments maynot appear in measurable forms of increased output or reduced costs but may take the form of improved standards of service which are none the less of value for not being quantifiable. The weight to be attached to these considerations in assessing remuneration is very much a matter of judgment and thus incapable ofconclusive statistical demonstration.48. We can best end this chapter of our report by quoting a letter which was sent on our behalf to the representatives of general medical practitioners whenthey sought our guidance in May 1965:&quot; The Review Body&apos;s terms of reference require them:&apos; To advise the Prime Minister on the remuneration of doctors and dentiststaking any part in the National Health Service.&apos;In recommending these terms of reference for the Review Body theRoyal Commission on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration made it clearthat they were deliberately not seeking to tie the Review Body&apos;s hands forthe future, in circumstances which they could not themselves foresee, andthat it would be for the Review Body to decide what factors might be relevant at any particular time and the weight to be attached to them. Inthis respect the Review Body are different from the Royal Commission, whowere specifically enjoined in their Royal Warrant to consider what shouldbe the proper current levels of medical and dental remuneration in the lightof comparisons with remuneration received in other professions andoccupations.Without seeking to tie the Review Body&apos;s hands the Royal Commissionexpected that movements of earnings in other professions would be amongthe factors which would always be relevant to a review of medical and dentalremuneration. This was an expression of view, not a mandate: in any suchreview the Review Body would be free to decide whether to make com-comparisons with other incomes and what weight to attach to them in framingtheir recommendations. If comparisons of incomes are made, they must of. course be on a basis which ensures so far as possible that like is beingcompared with like and must take account of differences in workload,responsibilities and conditions of service.
The Royal Commission^ Report was an important landmark in thehistory of medical and dental remuneration and up to now has formed the starting point of the Review Body&apos;s recommendations. Nevertheless the review Body have always regarded themselves as completely free to assessremuneration on whatever basis and in whatever manner seemed to themright at the time. They see no reason to depart from this principle. Theywould not regard themselves as bound to take the Royal Commission^recommendations as their starting point or as inhibited by any view of whatwas appropriate in the past from reaching whatever conclusions they thought right in the circumstances and on the evidence available to them atthe time of a review.&quot;49. We have followed these principles in framing the conclusions andrecommendations in this report. We have not sought to determine whethermedical and dental remuneration was &quot; right&quot; or &quot; adequate &quot; in 1939, in1948, in 1952, in 1957, in 1960 or in 1963. Spens and Danckwerts and Pilkington,even our own Fifth Report a year ago, are all landmarks of the past, not sign-posts or guidelines for the future. We have taken careful note of past history,and of all the evidence on comparisons with earnings in other professions andemployments (both that submitted by the professions and that which we havecollected for ourselves). We have also considered the present position and future prospects of the manning of the service and of the work and responsibilities which doctors and dentists are asked to undertake. We have had regard to the considerations of prices and incomes policy put before us in evidence by theGovernment, whose representatives gave us to understand that the principles ofthe policy were wide enough to embrace within the national interest both thestatutory duty of Ministers to provide a national health service and, more generally, the importance of medical and dental services to economic and social welfare. Thus we have regarded it as our main task to decide what doctors and dentists should be paid in the circumstances of the two years from 1st April 1966,and not simply to start from a view of what was or was not appropriate in thepast or to preserve for their own sake patterns, either within the medical and dental professions or between those and other professions, which may have beenright at some past date but are not necessarily right today.\\
CHAPTER IVMANPOWER AND WORKLOAD IN THE HOSPITAL AND general medical SERVICESManpower50. In considering the remuneration of hospital doctors and of general medical practitioners we have paid particular attention to the manpower needsof the hospital service and the general medical service and the prospects of meeting those needs. Since we are dealing with a single profession manning thetwo services, this problem falls into two parts: recruitment to and wastage fromthe medical profession in this country, and the distribution of doctors betweenthe two services. We have not examined recruitment of doctors in the publichealth services, in industry and elsewhere outside the National Health Service,even though they are part of the medical profession as a whole; our terms ofreference do not cover doctors outside the National Health Service. All our discussion of hospital staff in this chapter is in terms of medical staff, not dentalstaff. Dental staff account for only a small proportion of hospital medical and dental staff, and the nature and conditions of their work differ in some respects from those of medical staff. We have not, however, sought to distinguish between medical and dental staff in the recommendations we make in Chapter V.51. The number of qualified doctors in practice (whether general practice orthe hospital service) is primarily determined by the output of the medical schools in this country. Since it takes five or six years for a medical student to qualify(and another year as a house officer in hospital to be eligible for registration),measures to influence recruitment to medicine take a long time to affect thenumber of registered doctors coming into practice. There are more well-qualifiedapplicants for admission to medical schools than there are places; the limit onthe intake is at present the number of places available. There was a deliberatereduction in the intake following the recommendations of the Willink Com-rnittee in 1957, the effects of which upon the number of doctors qualifying have become apparent in the last few years. That reduction was, however, fairlyquickly reversed. If students from the Commonwealth and other countires overseas are excluded, the output of doctors from medical schools is expected torise from a level of about 1,700 in 1966 to about 2,050 in 1970. The output fromBritish medical schools of qualified doctors from the Commonwealth and other overseas countries is likely to fall from the 1963-65 level of about 200 a year toabout 150 a year by 1970. The output of British medical schools is thus expectedto grow at an average rate of about 80 a year between now and 1970.
52. The number (whole-time equivalent) of hospital doctors in Great britain has been rising steadily in recent years. From 1960 to 1964 it rose by a little over2,000 (about lOf per cent.), from 19,323 to 21,399. For the main grades the increases were:Consultants and senior hospital medical officers    639     (7-9 per cent.)Senior registrars ......      ..    204    (17-2 per cent.)Registrars and junior hospital medical officers    777    (18-3 per cent.)Senior house officers and house officers      ..    447     (7-7 per cent.)The rise in the number of overseas-born doctors in the grades of registrar and below was about 1,200, and thus equivalent to virtually the whole of the increasein numbers in those grades.53. In 1964 the Ministry of Health announced the results of a review of medical staffing structure in hospitals in England and Wales, following thereport of a Joint Working Party on Medical Staffing Structure in the hospital service, under the chairmanship of Sir Robert Platt. The original proposals of hospital boards would have required the equivalent of the whole time of 5,000extra doctors, including 1,800 consultants, to be added to hospital medical staffsover a period of five years. These proposals were scaled down by agreementbetween the Ministry of Health and the profession. Even after this adjustment, it seemed clear that something like 3,500 additional doctors, over and above those required to replace those who die or retire, would be needed for the hospital service in England and Wales over five years, of whom about 1,100 would be inthe consultant grade and about the same number in the intermediate grades.To these figures must be added the corresponding requirements in Scotland.Some of this requirement should eventually be met by bringing more general practitioners into hospital on part-time appointments; but while the pressure on general practitioners remains so heavy, help from that source must belimited.54. The Health Departments told us at the end of 1964 that the numbersof doctors in the hospital service might be expected to rise by about 2,000between 1964 and 1971. This estimate was dependent on the following mainassumptions:(a) the numbers of doctors entering general practice and the hospital servicerespectively would be constant each year from 1964 to 1971 at levelsfifty less on each side than the numbers entering in 1962-63;(b) the number of doctors from Commonwealth and other countires overseas entering the hospital service each year would remain constantfrom 1964 to 1971 at the same level as in 1962-63;(c) the loss of doctors from the hospital service from all causes (includingemigration) each year would remain constant from 1964 to 1971 at thesame rate as in 1962-63.No later estimates were available to us. Even on those assumptions the numberof additional doctors available in the hospital service will fall substantially short of what the 1964 reviews (after the original estimates of hospital boards had beenscaled down) suggested would be needed; and in the light of later information,the assumptions about overseas doctors and about losses now seem optimistic.
The assumptions about numbers entering the service, on the other hand, do not seem to allow for the expected increase in the output of medical schools, towhich we refer in paragraph 51. But in any case the numbers of doctors in thehospital service are increasing, and are expected to go on increasing, even if not as fast as they should increase if needs are to be met in full. Indeed the health departments told us that they were controlling numbers in the hospital service,partly in order to ensure that the increase in the number of doctors did notoutpace the growth in the provision of hospitals and facilities but partly also inorder to maintain a supply of doctors to general practice.55. In general practice the situation and prospects are more serious, andhave become worse since we last reviewed them when we were preparing ourFifth Report. We reported then that the number of principals providing unrestricted-tricted general medical services ceased to rise in 1963, and had fallen by 74during the year ended 30th September 1964. This figure has since been revised to101. Provisional figures for the year ended 30th September 1965 show a net lossof 263 general practitioners, 57 in the first half of the year and 206 in the second.That is a fall of more than l\ per cent, over two years. There was a further net loss of 81 doctors in the quarter ended 31st December 1965. The Health Depart-ments told us that a projection based on experience in 1963-64 led to an estimate that the number of practitioners in the general medical services (including thoseproviding restricted services) in October 1971 would be about 900 less than inOctober 1963. Between October 1963 and the end of 1965, however, there hadalready been a net loss of about 450 principals providing unrestricted services;and, if losses were to continue at the rate reached in the second half of 1965,numbers would be 900 down on the October 1963 level not by 1971 but beforethe end of 1967. Moreover in our Fifth Report we drew attention to estimates that the total population of the United Kingdom would increase by about.65 per cent, between 1962 and 1967 and at about the same rate between 1967and 1972. These figures have also been revised: the estimates are now for increases of about 3.75 per cent, between 1962 and 1967 and 4.04 per cent,between 1967 and 1972.56. Figures17 of admissions to and withdrawals from general practice showthat the main cause of the net decline is the rise in the numbers of withdrawalsrather than the fall in the numbers of admissions. From 1,180 in the year ended30th September 1963 admissions have fallen to 1,093 (provisionally) two yearslater. The figure of withdrawals, however, has risen from 1,171 in the yearended 30th September 1963 (itself 201 higher than in the previous year) to1,356 in the year ended 30th September 1965; and again the evidence suggests asteep increase in the rate of withdrawals towards the end of the latter year. Therise in the rate of withdrawals has been particularly marked among doctors underthe age of forty-five.57. The emigration of British born and trained doctors has become amatter of serious concern. There has been much discussion of the statistics ofemigration and immigration of medical manpower, the fullest recent studybeing that by Brian Abel-Smith and Kathleen Gales18. We do not propose to17 The figures of admissions and withdrawals each include practitioners transferring from one-Executive Council to another, at a rate of between 20 and 30 a quarter. Withdrawalsinclude deaths and retirements.18 British Doctors at Home and Abroad, published in 1964 by the Codicote Press for The.. Social Administration Research Trust.
recapitulate the statistical evidence in detail. Abel-Smith and Gales estimatedthat for each year of the period from January 1955 to July 1962 an average ofabout 390 British born and trained doctors left Britain and did not return19.Some of these went to take up temporary appointments and would in due course return; others had some intention of returning at some time. No figurecomparable with this is available for later years. The Overseas Migration board have, however, published statistics collected on a sample basis of migrantsfrom and to the United Kingdom in 1964 by types of occupation20. Thesestatistics suggest that in 1964 1,200 doctors with United Kingdom passportsemigrated from this country and 300 immigrated; and that another 1,200doctors with passports of other countries emigrated and 1,500 immigrated: anet loss of 900 doctors with United Kingdom passports, counterbalanced by anet gain of 300 doctors with passports of other countries. It must be emphasised that these figures are not comparable with those derived from the researches ofAbel-Smith and Gales. They are subject to sampling errors, and to various otherimperfections. They cannot be taken as evidence that the rate of emigration hasincreased since 1962. None the less, when every allowance has been made foruncertainties in the figures, it seems clear that there has been a substantialpermanent loss. Britain can and should make a contribution to the development and welfare of less highly developed countries, but we find it very disquietingthat the net outflow of doctors with United Kingdom passports should be so high in relation to the output of qualified British doctors from British medical schools.58. The Abel-Smith and Gales study also gave figures for the last position inthe National Health Service of the doctors who had left the service to emigratebetween 1955 and 1962. More than half of them were hospital doctors in the grade of registrar and below; 1\ per cent, were senior registrars; only \\ percent, were consultants. Just under a quarter were general practitioners. Thecomment that Abel-Smith and Gales made on these figures was as follows:&quot; This ties in with our finding that the most usual time of leaving was three to six years after registration. The commonly held view that the majorityof those going abroad are ex-general practitioners is untrue . . . Butunwillingness to enter general practice, or stay in general practice as itexists under the National Health Service, was nevertheless the mostcommon complaint mentioned by those who responded to our postalquestionnaire from Canada and Australia.&quot;There is every indication in the figures made available to us that reluctance to stay in general practice has increased since 1962.59. So much for the statistical evidence on medical recruitment and wastage.It points in our view to the following conclusions:(i) The medical profession has not lost its appeal to young men andwomen considering what career to take up and so what training toundertake.18 The figure of 390 relates to doctors who were still abroad at the time when the inquiry wasconducted; it does not include doctors who left Britain and returned between 1955 and 1962.20 Overseas Migration Board: Statistics for 1964 (Cmnd. 2861), Table 3.
(ii) The National Health Service is failing to hold as many British traineddoctors as it should be able to hold or as it needs.(iii) There is no sign that a career as a consultant in the hospital service isregarded as unattractive or that there is any difficulty in filling appoint-ments; but the supply of doctors is likely for some time to be insufficient to meet all the needs of the service at this level if essential requirements for other sections of the profession are to be met.(iv) There are signs that the junior ranks of the hospital service are losingmore doctors than they should if the hospital service and general practice in this country are to be maintained. The losses are particularlyserious among those newly qualified and among registrars.(v) There have been serious losses among those who are in the early yearsof a career in general practice, and general practice is failing to attractenough young doctors.60. These conclusions fit not merely the statistical evidence but also thesymptoms of discontent that have manifested themselves in the profession overthe last year. We have had to consider to what extent inadequacy of remunera-tion is an underlying cause of trouble, and to what extent complaints madeovertly about remuneration are really attributable to some other cause ofdissatisfaction.Workload61. One cause of dissatisfaction of which we have heard a good deal inevidence is increased workload. It is, as we have said, a peculiarly difficultsubject on which to form views, because medical workload does not readily lenditself to definition and measurement. This difficulty is particularly acute inrelation to general practice, because of the nature of the work and the fact thatthe general practitioner works mainly on his own. Impressions on this mattermust inevitably have a substantial subjective element.62. Figures published by the Ministry of Health show a steady rise in thenumber of in-patients discharged or died (a slightly macabre statistic) and ofnew out-patient attendances at National Health Service hospitals since 1957.There has also been a steady rise in the number of hospital medical staff. Thefigures we give below are for England and Wales only.	1957	I960	1964	1957-60	1960-64	1957-64Patient turnover&quot;	No. (000&apos;i)	No. (000&apos;j)	No. (000&apos;s)	Increases	per cent, o	ver period in-patients discharged or died	3,794	4,136	4,725	9.0	14.2	24.5New out-patient attendances at						consultant clinics	6,927	7,123	7,505	2.8	5.4	8.3Accident and emergency						department attendances	11,530	12,290	13,436	6.6	9.3	16.5Hospital medical staff	No.	No.	No.			(whole-time equivalents):						Consultants and senior hospital						medical officers      .......	6,780	6,988	7,477	3.1	7.0	10.3Senior registrars       ......	1,008	925	1,140	-8.2	23.2	13.1Registrars and junior hospital						medical officers	3,250	3,693	4,363	13.6	18.1	34.2Senior house officers and house						officers       .........	4,621	4,951	5,330	7.1	7.7	15.other staff       .........	36	27	36			&quot;     &quot; Total............	15,695	16,584	18,346	5.7	10.6	16.9* Including patients receiving dental treatment, who account for a very small proportion of the totals.
63. The turnover of in-patients has thus risen faster than the total number of hospital medical staff since 1957. It is noticeable that, while the numbers ofregistrars have expanded considerably over the period, providing a base forfurther expansion in the senior grades, the average annual rate of increase in thenumber of house officers and senior house officers has been less since 1960 thanit was before. This no doubt reflects mainly the reduction of intake to medical schools after the report of the Willink Committee, to which we have already referred.64. Patient turnover is an inexact measure of the workload falling onhospital doctors. The number of beds in hospitals has actually fallen slightlysince 1957 and the rising number of patients treated has been accommodated bya reduction in the average length of stay in hospital. None the less the higherturnover must lead to some increase of workload at all levels; it will cause anincrease in the demand for diagnostic and treatment services and in the numberof operations. If we are rightly informed that the routine procedures of admissionand discharge of in-patients and much of the work in accident and emergencydepartments are generally entrusted to junior medical staff, the increase inpatient turnover may well have affected their workload even more directly thanthat of senior doctors.65. Two points were also strongly made to us by the representatives of thehospital doctors:(a) Developments in technique had profoundly altered the practice ofmedicine in recent years, and new techniques not only had to be learntand mastered but also required more time and increased the pressure andintensity of the doctor&apos;s work.(b) The hospital service could not run without an increasing number of house officers: increasingly consultants needed a larger number of junior staff (registrars as well as house officers) working under them inorder to cope with the volume of work. The fact that the number of house officers had risen by proportionately less than numbers of othergrades had addedto the burden on registrars and on senior doctors.66. There was no disagreement on the point that house officers and otherjunior hospital doctors were required to work for very long hours. The repre-sentatives of the Joint Evidence Committee told us that the house officer was likely to have to work about 70 hours a week, and to be on call for many more.Hours on duty, including periods on call, of as many as 100 or 120 a week for house officers were mentioned to us by the Health Departments. Long hours of duty for house officers are not, of course, a new feature of hospital life; but wethink that it is a legitimate assumption from the figures we quote in this chapterand from the other evidence we have heard that the burden on junior hospital doctors has been growing in recent years. This will be eased only slowly, as theoutput of the medical schools rises.67. The statistical evidence on workload in general practice is not easy to interpret. It is clear that, so long as the total population rises faster than thenumber of general practitioners, lists will tend to increase. The ratio of unrestricted-trieted principals in general practice to total population in Great Britain, whichwas 1:2,235 in 1961, fell slightly to 1:2,259 in 1963 and more sharply to 1:2,330in 1965. Over this period the number of assistants has fallen significantly, so that
the ratio of principals plus assistants to total population has fallen rather more rapidly. If withdrawals from general practice continue at the rate reached in thesecond half of 1965, this ratio will continue to deteriorate significantly. It is alsoto be supposed that, since very young and elderly patients have a greatermorbidity risk, the fact that the numbers of people in these groups are risingproportionately faster than the total population will further intensify the degreeof additional pressure on the doctors. There is little reason to doubt that in thelast year the abolition of prescription charges has added to some extent to the family doctor&apos;s workload.68. There also remains the very strong impression, certainly in the minds of doctors themselves and fixed strongly in our minds by their representatives, of a growing burden on doctors, beyond anything that can be accounted for by the developments to which we have referred, to a point that many doctors are beginning to find insupportable. One would expect to find a reflection of this instatistics of consultations per patient. Figures on this are, however, very uncer-tain. In evidence the Health Departments said that no statistics available to themrevealed a significant increase in the average number of contacts per patient onlist. In answer to our questions they amplified this statement as follows:&quot; Figures obtained by the Departments&apos; Regional Medical Officers in thecourse of visiting 3,282 doctors between December 1964 and May 1965show an annual equivalent of 5-6 contacts (4-0 surgery attendances and1-6 visits), which is almost exactly the same total as that found by Professor(now Sir Austin) Bradford Hill in a sample of about 300 doctors for thesame months in 1949-50 (for the first twelve months Professor Bradford Hillfound a ratio of 5-22). In 1955-56, on the other hand, the General RegisterOffice found an average of 3-8 from 171 doctors on the Research Register ofthe College of General Practitioners. The College itself found in August1964 an annual equivalent of 5-05 from 356 doctors on the Research Register.It seems difficult to base firm conclusions on these figures.&quot;69. The profession^ representatives reminded us that these figures would not reflect increases in time spent on each consultation, and drew attention to anumber of other factors which were tending to increase the burden of work on family doctors, notably:(i) The establishment of a free health service had increased the use whichpeople made of the services of the family doctor, and the increasedhealth-consciousness which this helped to generate meant that demand on the doctor continued to grow. The doctor&apos;s contract was open-ended, in the sense that though remuneration and conditions of service were fixed by the State, the services rendered depended entirely upon thedemands of the patients, on which no external restraint was placed.(ii) Even though the requirements of the Ministry of Pensions and national insurance on medical certification for eligibility for benefits were beingmodified, doctors were asked to sign certificates for many other purposes.(iii) The increase in stress diseases tended to increase the extent of patient-doctor contacts, both in terms of numbers of consultations and interms of average length of consultation (because the doctor had notonly to conduct a careful examination in case the symptoms maskedorganic disease but also to try to trace the origins of the stress which had given rise to the symptoms).
(iv) More diagnostic tests, and the advent of more powerful drugs thedosage and effects of which had to be frequently checked, had alsoadded to the doctor&apos;s workload for a given number of patients.70. The profession^ representatives accepted that the remedies (as opposedto the reward) for increased workload were more doctors and better organisa-tion, but they told us that recent experience showed that one result of betterorganisation was to increase the patients&apos; demand for doctors&apos; services.71. We find it impossible to express a judgment on the burden of workloadon general practitioners in terms of statistical values. We have no doubt thataverage workload has increased in recent years, and that for many doctorsworkload has increased considerably. We think that the sense of being over-loaded is exacerbated by a feeling that too much of the work that the general practitioner is being asked to do is trivial, and not only does not call for the fullexercise of his clinical skill but also makes it more difficult for him to practicegood medicine and to provide the best standard of service to those whose need of medical advice and skill is real and urgent. Some of this work requires a judgment or decision which only a doctor can take; and much of it is probablyan inevitable result of the relationship between a doctor and his patient and thefact that the general practitioner is the first person to be consulted when the patient feels the need of medical help. There must be very few practitioners whowould want their patients to be deterred from consulting them when they neededhelp and advice. But there is a clear feeling that nowadays patients, undeterredby any charge, come to their doctors for minor disorders and injuries of a kindwith which their parents would not have troubled the doctor. The sense offrustration to which preoccupation with trivia gives rise would be alleviated, tosome extent at any rate, by better practice organisation and more ancillary help.But in the meantime, once a man is under the strain of overwork, further additions to his burden which may be individually slight in themselves may have disproportionately-portionate effects on his sense of strain, particularly if he can see no term to the pressure under which he is working. We take very seriously the point made to us by the Health Departments (not just as their own view but as something whichwas also causing anxiety in the profession) that, while a doctor may up to a pointbe able to deal with more patients without loss of efficiency, there comes a timewhen the price of taking on more patients, or of an increase in workload fromother causes, is a lower standard of service.Manpower and workload: implications for remuneration72. Finally we have had to consider how far the conclusions we havereached on manpower and workload are related to remuneration, so as to formjudgments on the extent of the increases which they require and justify.73. The losses of doctors that we record in the first section of this chapterand the increases in the burden of work that we discuss in the second section are clearly interrelated: the increase in the burden on junior hospital doctors and on general practitioners is greater because some have gone; and the risk of furtherlosses is greater because of the growth of the burden of work and the discontentthus engendered.74. It is difficult to assess how far dissatisfaction with remuneration hasbeen a contributory cause of the losses of doctors from the hospital service and
from general practice. In the course of their inquiries Abel-Smith and. Galescollected some information on doctors&apos; reasons for emigrating; the commentsthey received were not necessarily representative but they were perhaps indica-tive. They can be summarised as follows:(a) Some doctors (particularly those emigrating to the United States)went in search of better opportunities for salaried teaching and research;job prospects in this line seemed poor in Britain.(b) Some doctors were not prepared to go on working under the national health Service.(c) Many doctors were dissatisfied with the role and scope of general practice in this country, and in particular with the dissociation ofgeneral practice from the work, resources and privileges of the hospital service.(d) Many doctors had failed to obtain a post of the desired seniority in thespecialty of their choice, and were unwilling to go into general practice.(e) Some doctors had simply failed in repeated applications for generalpractices.(f) Some doctors went out of curiosity or restlessness.There does not seem to have been any appreciable number of doctors whoemigrated solely or mainly because they thought remuneration in this countryinadequate, though a number of those who gave other main reasons for emigrat-ing coupled criticisms of the level of remuneration with those other reasons.75. It has to be remembered that the doctors who made these commentsemigrated before 1962, in some cases many years before. What they said is notconclusive about what counts today. We must also record two coincidencesthat may be no more than that. The first coincidence is that Abel-Smith andGales found that the number of doctors going abroad had been steadily increas-ing up to the period 1958-60, but the figure for 1961-62 suggested a change intrend: the Royal Commission^ report on remuneration was published inFebruary 1960. The second coincidence is that the rate of withdrawals fromgeneral practice rose steeply in the third quarter of 1965: our Fifth Report,which recommended increases in remuneration for general practitioners that were widely and publicly stigmatised as inadequate (or worse), was published in February 1965 and was followed by several critical weeks during which thediscontent of general practitioners received much attention not only in the profession but outside.76. Our own conclusions are:(i) The first critical point in a doctor&apos;s career comes soon after qualification.Many who leave the hospital service at this stage withdraw for reasonsunconnected with remuneration. Yet we think that there are some particularly those with family commitments who would like to staybut for whom the existing level of remuneration in the house officer and) senior house officer grades has been a decisive reason for leaving, andothers for whom it has been at any rate an important contributorycause.(ii) The second critical point comes at the registrar level. In his first orsecond year as a registrar a doctor has to review his prospects and
consider his future. He has to consider whether, if he stays in thehospital service, he wants or is likely to obtain promotion first to seniorregistrar and then to consultant, or whether he would be content tomove in due course to the medical assistant grade and take his chance of becoming a consultant later on by that approach. Some doctors mayalways have intended to go into general practice; others may prefer a future in general practice to the future they foresee for themselves inthe hospital service. These are the main choices, but there are others.We think that at this stage too many doctors who for one reason or another do not want to stay in the hospital service are rejecting the choice of general practice, even if emigration is the alternative. We alsothink that with some doctors dissatisfaction with the level of remunera-tion at this stage of the career, or possibly with the level of remuneration for the medical assistant grade, may be a contributory cause of adecision to leave the service.(iii) Though the hospital service should grow and is growing, and its longer term needs require a substantial expansion in the number of hospital doctors, the evidence does not suggest that the higher ranks of thehospital service are failing to prove sufficiently attractive.(iv) General practice is failing both to attract and particularly to retain as many younger doctors as it needs. This is a most alarming development.Furthermore, the steady reduction in the number of doctors in general practice, in face of the increase in the population, is the main, but not theonly, reason for the increase in the average workload.77. In our opinion the unattractiveness of general practice is primarily amatter of conditions and workload: doctors find that they are not able, or fear that they will not be able, to practise good medicine in the conditions and underthe strains of general practice. The remedies for these problems lie, we are convinced, in more doctors, better vocational preparation for general practice,better organisation (including more group practice and more use of ancillaryhelp) and a closer relationship with the hospital service. An increase of remunera-tion by itself will not make it easier to practise good medicine, though it maymake difficult conditions more tolerable for a time.78. None the less, though in general the level of remuneration may not bethe only cause of the present troubles in general practice, it clearly is an important element in the widespread sense of discontent and dissatisfaction among general practitioners. It has been suggested to us in evidence that this is attributable to adecline in relative remuneration since before the war. It may indeed be thatdoctors&apos; remuneration has risen by proportionately less than incomes of lesswell-paid people since 1939; but they have this in common with a great many other professional and highly qualified men.- Our view is that standards andrelativities of remuneration in 1939 are of only limited relevance in 1966: societyhas changed so profoundly since 1939. On the other hand, we think that there issubstance in the view that the level of remuneration does not at present ade-adequately reflect current conditions in general practice: we believe that theseconditions do justify a considerably larger total amount of remuneration, sodistributed as to give better rewards to high standards of medicine and toencourage doctors to organise their practices in a way that will help them toprovide a service which meets the requirements of today.
79. Some of the remedies for the present conditions could begin to be effective quite quickly; others will take time. The overriding immediate need isto stop further deterioration of the general practitioner service and to begin to promote the changes that will bring about its recovery. The maintenance ofthe service in the immediate future depends mainly on the existing doctors: onreducing the flow of emigrants and on keeping up the flow of new recruits intogeneral practice. We are convinced that for this purpose a substantial increase of remuneration is urgently necessary and fully justified. But unless our recom-mendations are regarded not only as directly contributing to the maintenance ofthe service in the immediate future but also as one element in a much widerattack on the needs and problems of general practice, they will not be succeedingin the objectives which we are seeking to achieve.80. To sum up, our recommendations are intended to recognise, and webelieve them to be required by:(i) the immediate need to reduce losses of newly-qualified doctors from thehospital service, to improve the attractiveness of service in juniorhospital grades, whether as a prelude to a career in the hospital service or to a career in general practice, and to reward the increasing workloadon these grades;(ii) the longer-term need to maintain the attractiveness of a career in thehospital service, with a view to the substantial expansion envisaged for hospital medical staff in all grades;(iii) the immediate need to increase admissions to and stem withdrawalsfrom general practice, and to reward the increasing workload in general practice;(iv) the longer-term need to promote the remedies which will foster prideand confidence in general practice and make it a more attractive andsatisfying career.
HiCHAPTER VREMUNERATION OF HOSPITAL MEDICAL AND DENTAL STAFF81. In this chapter we consider in detail the remuneration from the national health Service of hospital medical and dental staff in clinical appointments,of administrative medical staff in hospitals, and of ophthalmic medical practitioners, and we state our recommendations on new salary scales andother payments for the two years from 1st April 1966. Our discussion in this chapter is mainly in terms of doctors, but our recommendations are intended toapply equally to the small numbers of dental staff in the hospital service.Clinical staff82. The present grading and salary structure of clinical staff in the hospital service is as follows:(a) The most junior grade is that of house officer. The newly qualifieddoctor enters this grade, usually at the age of 24 or 25. Each post inthis grade is held for a period of six months, and two &quot; approved &quot;posts, providing a range of general experience, must be held, and theduties satisfactorily performed, before the doctor qualifies for fullregistration. After registration he will generally hold at least one further post in the grade. There are separate salary rates for each ofthe first two posts held and a final rate for third and subsequent posts.The present rates are  770 for the first post and  855 for the second post(giving an average salary of  812 10s. in the first year), and  940 inthe third and subsequent posts. We were informed that it was normal practice for a doctor to hold up to three house officer posts; it would,we understand, be very unusual to hold more than five posts, or spendlonger than three years, in the grade.(b) The next higher grade is that of senior house officer, the salary for whichis  1,195 for a doctor aged 27 or under,  1,255 for a doctor of 28 or over. Doctors are unlikely to spend more than a year or two in this gradebefore obtaining a registrar appointment.(c) The present salary scale for the registrar grade is  1,425 rising afterone year to  1,595. The Health Departments told us that it was normal practice for a doctor to pass two years in the grade, but it appears from figures that have been put before us that it is by no means un-common to spend three or four years, or even longer. It is when the doctor has been a registrar for about two years that he has to decide(if he has not already decided beforehand) upon the direction hisfurther career is to take: whether he should seek an appointment asa senior registrar with a view to becoming a consultant in a few years;whether he should move on to the medical assistant grade with itslonger scale, regarding a consultant appointment as a remoter possibility-lity; whether he should move into general practice; or whether heshould go out of the National Health Service altogether.
td) Experience as a senior registrar is the normal preliminary to seekingappointment as a consultant. The present salary scale for the seniorregistrar grade is one of seven points, from  1,710 to  2,395, the lasttwo increments each coming after two years instead of one so thatthe whole scale spans a period of nine years. It is normal practice topass four years in the grade, but it is by no means unknown for a doctor to spend up to nine years as a senior registrar.(p.) The medical assistant grade (with the corresponding assistant dentalsurgeon grade) has been created since our first review, following the^commendations of the Working Parties on Medical Staffing structure in the Hospital Service. This intermediate grade is intended for those&quot; able to assume larger responsibility delegated to them by senior staff,to undertake on the responsibility of the senior staff some of the complexdiagnostic and therapeutic procedures, and to give continuing support and supervision to the house officer grade.&quot; Staff in this grade thus donot act entirely on their own independent responsibility. They will,however, have had considerable experience, and they will be carryingintermediate responsibility comparable with that of senior registrarsand registrars whose work they will supplement. Many of them will bein process of training for the consultant grade, but the medical assistantgrade is intended to provide a worthwhile career for those who continue in the hospital service without the responsibility of the consultant. the salary scale, which was agreed by the Health Departments and therepresentatives of the profession and has not until now been consideredby the Review Body, runs from  1,650 (just above the second and finalpoint of the registrar scale) by fourteen increments of  90 to  2,910(equal to the minimum of the consultant scale).(f) The senior grade in the hospital medical staffing structure is that of theconsultant, the salary scale of which runs from a minimum of  2,910(which is related to age 34) by eight annual increments of  170 and afinal increment (after two years at the penultimate point) of  175 toa maximum of  4,445. More than half the total number of consultantsare employed on a part-time basis, and paid at sessional rates based onthe whole-time salary scale up to a maximum of nine-elevenths of thewhole-time rate for a &quot; maximum part-time &quot; consultant. Part-timeconsultants are at liberty to undertake private practice.(g) The grades of senior hospital medical (and dental) officer, junior hospital medical officer and general dental surgeon will not continue to be part of the permanent structure, and no new appointments are beingmade. The salary scale of the senior hospital medical officer grade runsfrom a minimum of  2,280 (related to age 34) by four annual incrementsof  85 and four biennial increments of  115 to a maximum of  3,080;the scale for the junior hospital medical officer grade runs from aminimum of  1,255 by three annual increments of  65 and five annualincrernents of  70 to a maximum of  1,800. The scale for the general dental surgeon grade runs from a minimum of  1,610 by fourteenincrements of  80 to a maximum of  2,730. Certain senior hospital medical officers have been occupying posts approved as consultant posts,and have been receiving a special allowance of  625. The grading of
these officers is being individually reviewed. Nearly 900 have beenregraded as consultants, but about 100 remain as senior hospital medical officers with allowances, and there are about 1,200 seniorhospital medical officers who do not hold allowances.Junior hospital doctors83. It was strongly put to us by the representatives of the profession thatjunior hospital doctors up to and including senior registrars were particularlyseriously underpaid both in relation to the work they were asked to do and by comparison with earnings at comparable ages in other professions and employ-ments. It was proposed that the first year&apos;s salary for a house officer should be 1,200, and that new scales should run from about  2,000 to  2,400 for registrarsand from about  2,400 to  3,200 or  3,300 for senior registrars.84. The Health Departments informed us that they considered that therewas some justification for proportionately higher increases for house officersand senior house officers than for other grades, provided that these wereaccommodated within an overall increase for hospital doctors and dentistswhich ought not to exceed the incomes policy norm. This view was specificallyrelated to the long hours of duty and exacting work undertaken by these grades.85. The Health Departments and the representatives of the profession were thus agreed in principle upon the need for changes in the salary structure forjunior hospital doctors. It was further pointed out that many staff in the seniorhouse officer and registrar grades were at present dependent for any increasein remuneration on obtaining a more senior post. This was not consistent with experience at similar age levels in other professions and employments. Moreover,the years immediately following full registration were years of rapid develop-ment in skill and confidence in the practice of medicine, and this could well berecognised through the salary structure by the granting of additional increments.Longer salary scales for junior hospital doctors to the level of registrar, and amore coordinated and even salary progression up the structure, would make for greater flexibility and more accurate correspondence with patterns of experience in the service, and would encourage doctors who might benefitthereby to stay a few years longer and gain extra experience in the hospital service before entering general practice. The Departments and the professionhad therefore reached agreement in principle upon the idea of a &quot; commonextended scale &quot; for senior house officers, registrars and senior registrars, toprovide a regular salary progression through the three grades, with the maximum of each grade coinciding with or overlapping the minimum of the grade above.86. In our view the case for substantial increases for junior hospital doctors,and particularly for house officers and senior house officers, is overwhelming. Aswe have said, these grades undertake a great deal of the routine work that fallson medical staff in the hospital service, and may well be more directly affectedby the increase in patient turnover than their seniors. The numbers of houseofficers and senior house officers have been increasing less fast than the numbersof in-patients discharged or died and of accident and emergency departmentattendances; and we cannot overlook the fact that at the present time 40 percent, of doctors in the grades of registrar and below come from the Common-wealth and other overseas countries. House officers are commonly required to
live in hospital at least for their first year and often for longer, and to be on call for many of the hours for which they are not actually working. The health departments told us that house officers undertook exacting work, often inunpleasant circumstances, with long hours of duty and little leisure. the profession^ representatives put it more vividly: they described the life of thehouse officer as being almost monastic.87. We were told that, whereas house officers now receive salaries and are changed for board and lodging if they live in hospital, before 1948 they acceptedappointment virtually in an honorary capacity, being given only their boardand lodging and a laundry allowance. In those days it had been generally accepted that a house officer could not be a married man; indeed many hospital doctors used to postpone marriage until they became consultants. The pro-fession&apos;s representatives said that, as a result of changed social attitudes, this restriction is no longer acceptable. One-third to one-half of house officers are already married when they are first appointed, and many of them havechildren. These men are normally required to live in hospital during their time as house officers. During that time they see little of their families, for whom they have to provide from what is left of their salaries after the deduction ofboard and lodging charges for residence in hospital.88. The profession^ representatives also submitted evidence to show thatstarting salaries in other professions were much above the starting salaries of hospital doctors. It would be difficult to arrive at precise starting salaries for hospital doctors simply on the basis of comparisons with levels of earnings inother professions and employments at similar ages. The range of startingsalaries in other professions and employments is wide; and some account hasto be taken of career prospects. None the less we are in no doubt that a first-year salary of  812 for a qualified doctor of 24 or 25 is far too low by anystandard, and particularly in relation to the workload and responsibility he isexpected to undertake. We therefore consider that the starting salary needs tobe substantially improved. If the structure is not to be distorted, this improve-ment will extend in some degree to the grades above. This is not, however, justa matter of achieving a sensible salary structure, important though that is.There is a need in any case for significant improvements in the salaries of other of the junior grades, though the salaries of registrars and senior registrarsare not so far out of line as are the salaries of house officers.89. Two arguments have sometimes been put forward as justification forpaying the junior hospital doctors a relatively low salary: that up to the levelof senior registrar doctors are still in training, and that a relatively low levelof earnings in the early years has in the past been and should be accepted aspart of the conditions of an apprenticeship which leads to the prospects of relatively high earnings as a consultant after the age of 35 or so.90. There is some force in the second argument, in the sense that startingsalaries should not be settled without regard to career prospects. But the firstargument must not be overstated. It is true that until they become consultantshospital doctors&apos; do not undertake the full range of responsibility for patients,but there is no doubt that the junior grades in the hospital medical and dentalstaff carry a substantial part of the burden of the day-to-day clinical work.Moreover it is also true in other professions that there is in the early years of a
career a strong element of training and acquiring experience as well as ofcontributing to the work of the organisation or practice.Salary scales91. We are recommending a number of changes in the detailed salary structure for junior hospital doctors. The first relates to the house officer scale.Neither the Health Departments nor the profession wish to retain separaterates of salary for the first two house officer posts, held for six months eachduring the year before a doctor qualifies for full registration. There is noelement of promotion in the move from one post to the other: the doctor isexpected to undertake two appointments, normally one medical and onesurgical, to give him a good range of general experience before he is registered.On the other hand some house officers may continue in the grade for morethan a year after registration, in order to extend their experience or for other reasons. We are therefore proposing a three-point scale, but with annu 1instead of bi-annual increments. We recommend that no house officer who is not fully registered should go beyond the second point of the scale.92. For senior house officers we are also recommending a three-point scalewith annual increments, again to provide for those who stay longer than thenormal period in the grade. We recommend that the starting salary of seniorhouse officers on appointment to the grade should be the minimum of the scaleirrespective of age.93. For registrars we are recommending a five-point scale, with the lasttwo points overlapping the first two points of the senior registrar scale. Manyregistrars will, we know, move on before the end of four years, but it is clearthat some do not, and we have thought it right to provide a further incrementfor them. If the pattern changes and it becomes less common to spend more than four years in the grade, we may want to consider at some future review stopping the scale at the fourth point.94. For the senior registrar grade the pattern of experience is expected to change. The Health Departments told us that &quot; it should not happen thatnumbers of senior registrars will again spend more than five years in the grade &quot;in view of the proposals for the medical staffing structure in the hospital service.The reaction of the professions&apos; representatives to this statement was welcoming,but sceptical. We have thought it right to recommend a six-point scale withannual increments, to make some provision for senior registrars who remain inthe grade for longer than five years; this scale will replace the present seven-point scale with four annual and two biennial increments.95. We accept the general principle of the &quot; common extended scale &quot; for senior house officers, registrars and senior registrars and we are recommendingsalary scales accordingly. The fact that the scales will now meet or even overlapraises the problem of what should happen to a doctor who, having reached themaximum of a lower grade, then takes up an appointment which involves hispromotion to the next higher grade, the minimum of the salary scale for whichmay be the same as (or lower than) the maximum of the lower grade. the health Departments suggested that it would be consistent with the general principle of the &quot; common extended scale &quot; that in these circumstances thereshould be no increase of pay on promotion; the doctor concerned would simply
move into the new grade at his existing salary and proceed to the next pointabove that on the scale of the higher grade when he was next due for an annualincrement. We share the view of the Royal Commission that promotion froma lower to a higher grade should in all cases provide some increase in remunera-tion.21 We therefore recommend that the existing provisions in the terms andconditions of service governing starting pay on promotion should apply topromotions in the circumstances we have described.96. For the avoidance of doubt we desire to make it clear that we considerthat a doctor promoted to a higher grade from a salary point on the scale ofthe lower grade which is below the minimum of the scale for the higher gradeshould start at that minimum and proceed up the scale by annual increments;he should not have to mark time at the minimum of the higher grade because he was promoted before he reached the maximum of the lower grade.97. Two further points remain on the salary arrangements for juniorhospital doctors. At present a doctor who wishes to broaden his experience by undertaking training in a particular specialty may have to accept an appoint-ment in a lower grade in order to do so. At present, as we understand it, hedrops to the salary scale for the lower grade. It is not desirable that doctorsshould be discouraged in this way from extending their knowledge and experience in ways which will be of benefit to the service as well as to themselves. Wetherefore recommend that, where a doctor accepts an appointment in a lower grade for approved training purposes, so long as he remains in the lower gradehe should continue to receive the salary which he was receiving at the time whenhe left his last appointment in the higher grade, and he should continue to earn incremental credit in the higher grade so that, when he reverts to an appointment in it, he re-enters the salary scale at the point which he would havereached if he had never left it.98. We were also invited by the profession to recommend some compensa-tion (for example by the grant of a year&apos;s seniority) to a young doctor whoobtains an approved higher qualification. It was pointed out that obtaining ahigher qualification puts the doctor to some expense in various ways (forexample, on examination fees and on buying books) and may also require himto forego earnings for a period in order that he may devote his whole time to study. The obtaining of such qualifications is, however, a condition of appoint-ment to higher grades. The higher salaries for those grades are thus themselves a reward for obtaining the required qualifications, and we are not satisfied thatit is necessary or justifiable to give any compensation over and above that.99. The Health Departments and the representatives of the professioninvited us to preserve the existing relationships between the medical assistantscale on the one hand and the consultant scale on the other. We have broadlyaccepted this advice. We wish in passing although nomenclature is not ourbusiness to record our view that &quot; medical assistant&quot; is a misleading titlefor a doctor with the degree of responsibility and experience which is expected of doctors in this grade. It may even lead to confusion with &quot; medical auxiliary &quot;.We hope that consideration will be given to finding a more suitable title.
100. We were asked by the profession^ representatives to consider two detailed changes in the consultant^ salary scale, apart from the general salaryincrease:(a) that the minimum of the scale should no longer be linked to agethirty-four;(b) that the interval of two years before the final increment becomespayable should be reduced to one year.On the first point, it was argued that it was becoming more common for doctorsto be promoted consultant before the age of thirty-four and that, if a man was good enough to be promoted, he was good enough to progress up the incre-mental scale without marking time until his thirty-fifth birthday. We accept thispoint, and therefore recommend that the minimum of the scale should no longer be linked to age thirty-four, and that a consultant appointed at an age of lessthan thirty-four should not have to wait until his thirty-fifth birthday beforebecoming entitled to his first increment. We recommend a ten-point scale withnine annual increments; we think it unnecessary to retain the rule wherebyconsultants pass two years at the penultimate point of the scale before movingon to the maximum. Thus all consultants will proceed up to the maximum of thescale by annual increments, at whatever age they are appointed.101. We recommend the introduction with effect from 1st April 1966 ofnew salary scales for full-time doctors and dentists in the main clinical grades in the hospital medical and dental staffing structure as follows:(a) House officers:  1,100 rising by two annual increments of  100 to amaximum of  1,300.(b) Senior house officers:  1,450 rising by two annual increments of  100to a maximum of  1,650.(c) Registrars:  1,650 rising by four annual increments of  100 to amaximum of  2,050.(d) Senior registrars:  1,950 rising by one annual increment of  100 and four further annual increments of  125 to a maximum of  2,550.(e) Medical assistants and assistant dental surgeons:  1,850 rising byfourteen annual increments of  100 to a maximum of  3,250.(f) Consultants:  3,200 rising by five annual increments of  185 and fourfurther annual increments of  190 to a maximum of  4,885.102. We recommend the following general arrangements for assimilatingstaff from the present scales to the new scales on this occasion:(a) House officers and senior house officers: staff in their first year in the grade to the first point; staff in their second year in the grade to thesecond point; staff who have been in the grade for more than two years to the third point. No house officer who is not fully registered should go beyond the second point of the scale.(,b) Registrars: staff in their first year in the grade to the first point; staffin their second year in the grade to the second point; staff in their thirdyear in the grade to the third point; staff in their fourth year in the grade to the fourth point; staff who have been in the grade for morethan four years to the maximum.
(c) Senior registrars: assimilation by corresponding points; staff who havebeen more than five years in the grade to the maximum.(d) Medical assistants and assistant dental surgeons: assimilation by corresponding points.(e) Consultants: assimilation by corresponding points, the two-year pointin the present scale counting as a single point for this purpose.103. For junior hospital medical officers (a grade which will not continue as a permanent feature of the staffing structure) we recommend a scale rising from a minimum of  1,550 by eight annual increments of  60 to a maximum of 2,030. Assimilation should be by corresponding points. This scale will broadlymaintain existing relativities with other grades of junior hospital doctors.104. The senior hospital medical and dental officer grades will also not continue as permanent features of the staffing structure. In our Third Report22we indicated that we should reconsider the personal salary scales (and allowanceswhere held) of these officers when the salary scale of the medical assistant gradeand the corresponding dental grade was changed. The Health Departments told us that in their view &quot; it would not be justifiable to protect salary scales in such away that the holders received the benefit of any future revaluations of salaryscales except in highly exceptional circumstances &quot;. We were later told that this meant that the salaries of the senior hospital medical and dental officers in postsgraded as medical assistant should in the Health Departments&apos; view be assimil-ated to the medical assistant scale as soon as increases for medical assistantstook their scales above the present scale for senior hospital medical officers, withprotection for the allowances of those who were in posts graded as consultant aslong as they continued to hold them.105. If our recommendations are accepted, the scale for medical assistantswill now overtake the present scale for senior hospital medical officers. In ourview, however, the time has not yet come to assimilate the senior hospital medical officer scale to the medical assistant scale, and we are making recom-mendations which will continue a separate scale for senior hospital medical officers and preserve broadly the existing relativity with consultants. Werecommend that the system of biennial increments in the scale for seniorhospital medical officers should be dropped, and that the new scale should be anine-point scale, starting at  2,500, and rising by five annual increments of  100and three further annual increments of  125 to a maximum of  3,375. Assimila-tion should be by corresponding points, the existing two-year points counting assingle points for this purpose. We recommend that the special allowance for senior hospital medical officers in posts graded as consultant posts should beraised to  700.106. For whole-time general dental surgeons (another grade which is nowclosed to new entrants and will eventually cease to exist) we recommend a scale rising from  1,800 by one annual increment of  80 followed by thirteenannual increments of  90 to a maximum of  3,050. Assimilation should be by corresponding points.22 Cmnd. 2585, published in February 1965.
Part-time rates107. We recommend that rates of payment to part-time hospital doctors and dentists should be increased with effect from 1st April 1966 pro rata withthe increases in the salary scales of whole-time doctors and dentists in thecorresponding grades.108. Until 1960 part-time consultants paid on sessional rates calculated interms of notional half days were paid more than the strict proportion of thewhole-time rate. The Royal Commission reviewed this system of weighting,and decided that there were no sound arguments for retaining it. As a tran-transitional provision they recommended that a limited amount of weighting shouldbe retained on the remuneration of part-time consultants in post on 31stDecember 1959 and also on the remuneration of those who might later becomepart-time consultants provided that on 31st December 1959 they were in the grade of senior registrar or above. They recommended that no weighting shouldbe added for those eventually appointed part-time consultants who entered anyof these grades after that date.109. The profession represented to us that the weighting arrangements which existed before 1960 should now be restored. These representations seemedto us to be based mainly upon arguments which the Royal Commission had considered but had found unconvincing. The only new argument was that theworkload of consultants had increased, that the great majority of part-timeconsultants were giving more time to the hospital service than their contractsprovided for, and that the increased workload bore more hardly on the part-timer than on the whole-timer because it was more difficult for him to find the extra time among his other commitments. In our view the considerations which led the Royal Commission to recommend as they did are still valid, andwe do not find the additional argument of sufficient substance to cause us totake a different view. We therefore recommend that there should continue tobe no weighting for part-time consultants beyond that allowed for by the RoyalCommission^ transitional provision.Distinction awards110. We were asked to review not only the values of distinction awards for hospital consultants but also the method by which the numbers of awardsavailable are determined. Until 1960 the numbers of awards were determined onthe basis of percentages of numbers of consultants eligible; there were three levels of awards, 4 per cent, of all consultants eligible being selected for A awards,10 per cent, for B awards and 20 per cent, for C awards. The Royal commission were not satisfied that working on a percentage basis in this way was alwaysreasonable: they pointed out that there might be circumstances in which therewas a large influx of doctors into the grade for some special reason which wouldnot justify an automatic increase in the number of awards. They therefore recommended that instead of percentages there should be fixed numbers of awards. They recommended that a new award, above the A award (and sodescribed as an A Plus award) should be introduced, and that there should be
100 A Plus awards of  4,000, 300 A awards of  3,000, 800 B awards of  1,750and 1,600 C awards of  750. These numbers represented nearly 35 per cent, ofthe total number of consultants at the end of 1959: about 1J per cent, for A Plusawards, about 3f per cent, for A awards, about 10 per cent, for B awards and about 20 per cent, for C awards. Thereafter it was to be for the Review Body tosuggest any alteration in the numbers of awards which they thought was requiredby conditions from time to time.111. In our First Report in 1963 we stated that we did not consider itnecessary to change the number of distinction awards at that stage, but werecommended that the value of the awards should be increased by 14 per cent,from 1st April 1963.112. By September 1964, as the number of consultants had been steadily increasing, the percentage of consultants holding awards had fallen fromnearly 35 per cent to about 30  per cent. It became clear as a result of thereviews of hospital medical staffing that a further increase in consultant postscould be expected during the next few years. At the end of 1964, therefore, the profession invited us to recommend that the numbers of distinction awardsavailable should be increased and should be related once more by fixed per-centages to the total number of consultants. The percentages they proposed were:\\ per cent, for A Plus awards3J per cent, for A awards10 per cent, for B awards20 per cent, for C awards.In our Fourth Report23 we said that we should find it difficult to reach final conclusions on these proposals except in the context of a general review ofconsultant earnings; we therefore intended to consider the proposal in thecourse of the next general review. We were satisfied, however, that some imme-diate increase was necessary in the number of B and C awards, pending full consideration of the profession^ proposals, and we recommended that the totalnumber of B and C awards should be increased forthwith to 850 and 1,700respectively.113. In their evidence to us for this review the profession repeated theproposal which they had already put to us. We calculated that, on the basis ofconsultant numbers at 30th September 1965, the profession^ proposals would produce an extra 550 awards: 50 A Plus, 50 A, 150 B and 300 C awards. the health Departments suggested that we should recommend an additional 100awards in 1966 and a further 100 awards in 1967, but did not suggest how theadditional numbers should be distributed among the categories of awards.114. The proposal to revert to fixed percentages rather than fixed numbershas certain attractions. The number of award holders would vary automaticallywith the number of consultants, without the need for any special review oraction on our part; and it would ease the task of those responsible for advisingMinisters on the allocation of awards, since at any time they would have a23 Cmnd. 2585, published in February 1965.
clear idea of the number of awards likely to be available for distribution notonly immediately but over the next two or three years. None the less we thinkthat the considerations which led the Royal Commission to prefer a system of fixing numbers rather than percentages are still valid. They referred, by way ofexample, to a review which had then been recently completed of the grading of senior hospital medical officers, a number of whom had become consultants;and they suggested that, if some of these had become consultants only afterthe invoking of some appeal procedure, it was not very likely that they would themselves be strong candidates for awards, and that the percentage system of fixing numbers of awards would probably result in their promotion simplyincreasing the number of awards available for other consultants. Following thedecision in 1964 that the senior hospital medical officer grade should not con-tinue to be part of the permanent structure there has been a further review ofgradings. In consequence nearly 900 senior hospital medical and dental officers with allowances have been regraded as consultants, again in some cases after an appeal procedure. It would be surprising if this once-for-all addition ofabout 10 per cent, to the number of consultants warranted a corresponding increase in the number of award holders. For very similar reasons to thosewhich motivated the Royal Commission we therefore recommend that theallocation of awards should continue to be based on prescribed numbers of awards rather than on percentages of those eligible.115. In terms of the total number of consultants at 30th September 1965the present numbers of award holders represent about 29 per cent, of thoseeligible, and if there were no further increase in the number of awards thepercentage would continue to fall as the number of consultants rose. As aresult of the evidence we heard we are satisfied that the number of awardholders is still too low, even after our interim recommendation last year.Though there has been the once-for-all promotion of senior hospital medical and dental officers into the consultant grade which we have already described,there continues to be a steady increase in the number of younger doctorsappointed to the grade. We are advised that, as a result of the improved trainingwhich the hospital service has been able to provide, there is now an increasing number of consultants who in the judgment of those concerned deserve an award but for whom no awards are available.116. We recommend that the numbers and values of awards should beincreased from 1st April 1966 to the following:100 A Plus awards of  4,885315 A awards of  3,700950 B awards of  2,1751,900 C awards of  925.117. This will increase the total number of award holders by 315. This is a relatively large increase; but, apart from the small interim increase last year, itis the first since 1960, and throughout the years since then both numbers and standards of consultants have been rising. It would in our view be wrong for so long a period to elapse again without a further review of numbers of awards,particularly in view of expected developments in the consultant grade; and we recognise that those who are concerned with giving advice on the allocation of the awards need to be able to plan ahead to some extent. We therefore
propose in future to review the number of awards annually. We understandthat, as the committee which advises on allocations of awards formulates itsadvice in the early months of each year, the convenient time for such reviewswould be just before that, towards the end of the preceding year. We thereforeintend during the autumn of each year to discuss with representatives of the health Departments and of the profession and with the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the advisory committee whether any change in the number of awards available at the next allocation is called for, and to make recommenda-tions in time for them to be taken into account (if they are accepted) in the ensuing review by the committee.Other payments to clinical staff118. The Royal Commission recommended that &quot;peripheral&quot; hospitals(those outside cities and towns containing teaching hospitals) should beauthorised to pay allowances of up to  100 a year in addition to the ordinarysalary rates in order to recruit suitable staff in the grades of registrar, juniorhospital medical officer, senior house officer and house officer.24 Following our recommendations in 1963 the rate of this &quot; peripheral &quot; allowance was raised to a maximum of  115. We recommend that this rate should be raised to amaximum of  140 from 1st April 1966. Since no further appointments arebeing made in the junior hospital medical officer grade, for all new appointmentsthe allowance will be available in future only in respect of staff recruited in the grades of registrar, senior house officer and house officer.119. We recommend that the fee for a domiciliary consultation should beincreased from  4 16s. to  5 10s., and the additional fees pro rata, and thatthe permitted annual maximum of earnings under section Sff) of the Terms andConditions of Service of Hospital Medical and Dental Staff should be raised to  275 in any quarter or  1,100 in any year. We recommend no change in thearrangement whereby whole-time consultants (and whole-time senior hospital medical officers) who undertake domiciliary consultations should receive no feesfor the first eight such consultations each quarter.120. Hospital doctors give lectures to nurses in training; they also markexamination papers and conduct oral or practical examinations for the purposeof nurses&apos; training. They are traditionally paid fees for lectures to nurses, butnot for examinations: the Health Departments told us that they had agreed tolecture fees in 1952 on the understanding that no fees should be paid for taking part in examinations. Fees for lectures to nurses are differentiated accordingto the grade of the lecturer: the fee for consultants is at present  3 3s., for seniorhospital medical officers  2 7s. 6d., for medical assistants on salaries of morethan  3,350,  2 2s., and for the remaining medical assistants and other grades Ills. 6d.121. The profession represented to us that participation in the training ofnurses was important work for the hospital service. Moreover, though lecturesto nurses might be given during working hours, the doctor giving the lecturewould often find himself obliged to make up for lost time on other work by working out of normal hours. They considered that it was anomalous that thereshould be differential fees according to the grading of the lecturer. They pro-
posed that a fee of  4 4s. per lecture should be payable to any hospital doctorin whatever grade for lecturing to nurses. They also proposed that there shouldbe fees for taking part in the examination of nurses:  8 8s.for a 3  hour sessionof oral or practical examinations and the same fee for every twenty papersmarked.122. If we were starting afresh, we doubt whether we should want torecommend the introduction of fees for lectures to nurses. In other walks of life this sort of internal lecturing for training purposes is accepted as part ofthe contribution which senior members of a service make to the general wellbeingof the service without receiving additional remuneration, even though theymay have to work longer hours in order to make up for lost time. Since thisis a traditional feature of medical remuneration, we do not recommend theabolition of fees for lectures to nurses, but we would not wish to endorse anextension of the principle and we do not therefore recommend the introductionof fees for taking part in examinations.123. If fees are to be given for lectures to nurses, we do not think it un-reasonable that the fees should be differentiated according to the grade of thelecturer, particularly if the lectures entail some work outside normal hours:it seems reasonable to assume that the time and experience of a more highly paid doctor are worth a higher rate than those of a less highly paid doctor.Accordingly we recommend the following fees for lectures to nurses:Consultants  3 10s. Od.Senior hospital medical officers  2 15s. Od.Senior registrars and medical assistants  2 10s. Od.Other grades  2 0s. Od.We recommend that the fee for lectures by medical assistants should be thesame for all doctors in the grade, irrespective of salary level.124. We recommend that the fee for an exceptional consultation (payable to a consultant who, having no contract with a board, is called in exceptionallyto the board&apos;s hospital or clinic for a special visit) should be raised from  7 2s. 6d.to  10. We were invited by the profession to recommend that an additional feeof  25 should be payable for any operative work carried out in the context ofan exceptional consultation. We make no recommendation on this proposal,which should, we suggest, be discussed between the Health Departments andthe profession^ representatives.125. We recommend the following levels of payments to general practi-practitioners under Section 10 of the Terms and Conditions of Service of hospital medical and Dental Staff:(a) Payments to staff funds for general practitioner hospital units:  40 perbed.(b) Payments to part-time medical officers at convalescent homes etc.: 275 a year for each weekly &quot; half-day &quot;, up to a maximum of  2,475a year; 75 a year for one hour or less per week; 150 a year for over one hour but not more than two hours a week.
(c) Payments for occasional work in the blood transfusion service: 1 13s. 4d. per hour or part of an hour, with a maximum of  5 persession.(d) Payments for part-time general dental practitioner appointments: 275 a year for each v/eekly &quot; half-day &quot;, up to a maximum of  2,475a year; 75 a year for one hour or less per week; 150 a year for over one hour but not more than two hours a week.126. We recommend that the fee for exceptional consultations by general practitioners should be increased from  2 17s. 6d. to  3 5s. Od.127. We recommend that the special allowance for medical superintendentsof psychiatric hospitals should be increased from  285 to  310 a year.128. We recommend that weekly locum rates should continue to be cal-culated as l/52nd of the mean of the appropriate salary scale for all grades.Accordingly we recommend the following rates:Consultant appointment  77 15s. Od. a week or  7 Is. 6d.a notional half daySenior hospital medical (or dental)    56 10s. Od. a week or  5 2s. 6d.officer appointment a notional half dayMedical assistant or assistant  49 Is. Od. a week or  4 9s. Od.dental surgeon appointment a notional half daySenior registrar appointment  43 5s. 6d. a week or  3 18s. 6d.a notional half dayJunior hospital medical officer         34 8s. 6d. a week or  3 2s. 6d.appointment a notional half dayRegistrar appointment  35 11s. 6d. a week or  3 4s. 6d.a notional half daySenior house officer appointment      29 16s. Od. a week or  2 14s. Od.a notional half dayHouse officer appointment  23 Is. 6d. a week or  2 2s. Od.a notional half dayGeneral medical practitioner:appointment under Section 10(b)   5 6s. Od. a notional half day.129. The profession^ representatives invited us to consider the following proposals:(a) Occasional visits by consultants to outlying hospitals of their ownboards should be treated as exceptional consultations and remuneratedaccordingly.(b) Regular teaching commitments for which a consultant does not receiveremuneration from another source should be added to the items tobe taken into consideration in the assessment of contracts under paragraph 5(a)(1) of the Terms and Conditions of Service of hospital medical and Dental Staff.
(c) When a doctor rejoins the hospital service after having undertakenmedical practice outside that service (e.g. in a developing country, in her Majesty&apos;s Forces, in general practice or in research) he should beentitled to restart at the point on the scale which he would have reachedif he had not left the hospital service.(d) Seniority lost by service in developing countries should be added tothe factors which boards may take into account in fixing the startingsalary of a consultant.(e) It should be the duty of the Advisory Appointments Committee toconsider all the relevant factors in assessing the starting salary of aconsultant and to recommend to the board the appropriate startingsalary in each case.We make no recommendations on any of these proposals, and leave them fordiscussion between the Health Departments and the profession^ representatives.Board and lodging charges130. Hospital doctors who live in are charged for the board and lodgingwith which they are provided. The charges vary in amount from grade tograde. These charges have customarily been reviewed when remuneration was increased. The Royal Commission did not regard it as part of their task tomake recommendations about the amounts to be charged for board and lodging,and left it to the Whitley Council to formulate a scheme of charges. However,the Royal Commission expressed the view that, where individuals or classes of individuals were required to live in, the amount charged should be lower than would otherwise be appropriate. Accordingly doctors in posts for whichresidence in hospital is a condition of appointment are now allowed a discountof 12f per cent- on the charge appropriate for their grade.131. It was represented to us by the Joint Evidence Committee that at least the lodging charge, and preferably the charge for board as well, should not be levied upon those who are required to live in. It was pointed out to us thatvirtually every young doctor has to live in during his first year as a houseofficer, and for thbse who contemplate a career in the hospital service theperiod of compulsory residence in hospital may well include a second year orlonger. These doctors are required to live in so that they can be on call, and during this period the hours of work (including periods on call) are, as we have noted, very long. It was represented that the requirement of compulsory resi-dence might in any case tend to discourage young doctors, particularly thosewho were married and had children, from staying on in the hospital service to extend their qualifications. It was suggested that such a requirement wasunusual in other professions, and it was argued that in such circumstances the young doctor might expect to be compensated by being provided at leastwith free lodging. It was pointed out that the lodging charge bore particularlyheavily on young married doctors who had to maintain homes for their families.It was therefore proposed that the charge for lodging in all appointmentsincluding compulsory residence should be abolished.132. This proposal was strongly argued by the representative of the HospitalJunior Staffs Group Council of the British Medical Association on the JointEvidence Committee, and by the Hospital Junior Medical Staff Action Group.
The Joint Evidence Committee told us that they saw merit in a further proposal made by the Hospital Junior Staffs Group Council of the British medical association (which was also advanced by the Action Group): that officers whoare required to be permanently resident or to be resident either at night or atweekends in performance of their duty should receive free meals taken whilst on duty, so that they would be charged only for meals taken while off duty.133. The complete abolition of board and lodging charges for those requiredto live in would represent in effect a considerable increase in the pay of the doctors concerned, and we have not felt able to conclude this review withoutreaching a view on the subject.134. The Health Departments suggested that the principle in this matter should be that the salaries payable should be &quot; the rate for the job &quot;, and thatthose doctors who lived in, whether voluntarily or compulsorily, should pay for their board and lodging at economic rates, just as their colleagues who liveout have to do. They took the view that the obligation of compulsory residenceduring the first year of the career and in certain other appointments was oneof the conditions which the young doctor accepted in entering upon the careerand was therefore something to be taken into account in determining the salary rates generally, rather than by means of special arrangements for boardand lodging charges. They accepted, however, that a discount on the full charge should continue to be allowed if residence in the hospital was a condition of appointment. They reminded us that at present rates the board and lodgingcharges for junior grades, even without allowing for the discount for compulsoryresidence, were below a strictly economic level and thus contained an element of subsidy. They therefore invited us to endorse the principle that board andlodging charges should be assessed on an economic basis for all doctors living in, subject to the existing discount for compulsory residence, and to leavethe detailed application of this principle for negotiation between themselves and the profession.135. As we see it, the real difference between the Health Departments andthe profession is that the Health Departments regard the obligation of com-pulsory residence as a general condition of service, to be taken into account in fixing salaries but not to be separately remunerated. This principle is blurred, butperhaps not effaced, by the discount on the board and lodging charge for thosewho are compulsorily resident. The profession on the other hand regard theobligation of compulsory residence as unique, and as entailing a substantial additional burden of work, and are in effect proposing that this should berecognised by a concealed addition to remuneration in the form of free board andlodging.136. We find ourselves in some sympathy with the argument that a youngdoctor who is required to live in hospital, and is expected to be on call for very long periods, should get his lodging free. We have also very much in mind theparticular problem of the young married doctor, who is in effect paying twiceover when he is required to pay a board and lodging charge and to maintain a home for his wife and family. We see the theoretical force of the argument putforward by the Health Departments that the salary should be the rate for the job and that board and lodging charges should be assessed at economic rates.We douot, however, whether it would be practicable to take this argument to
its logical conclusion, since that would entail a substantial increase in thelodging charges for the junior grades. The existing arrangements do in practicerecognise that logic in this instance has to be tempered by other considerations.137. In our view the argument for remission applies with more force tothe charge for lodging than to the charge for board. Moreover the youngmarried doctor, though he has to maintain a home for his wife and family,does not have to eat meals in hospital and at home at the same time, thoughunder the existing arrangements he gets no remission on his board and lodgingcharge when he goes home for a meal.138. We think that this matter should be further discussed between the health Departments and the representatives of the profession, and we recom-mend that they should negotiate a system of charges based on the followingworking principles:(a) There should be no charge for lodging to a doctor for whom residencein hospital is a condition of his appointment.(b) For other doctors who live in hospital a lodging charge should bedetermined at an economic rate, having regard to the standard of accommodation provided.(c) All doctors, whether they are compulsorily or voluntarily resident andwhether they are on duty or off duty, should pay for meals they take in hospital.Our recommendations on remuneration are based on the assumption that these principles are followed. We recognise that the doctor who is required to live inwill gain less than he would do if the present charges were not subsidised.Administrative medical staff139. Medical administrators in hospitals are doctors who have no clinicalduties and are employed full time on administrative work. Their remunerationis based on a number of scales related not only to grading but also (in regional hospital boards) to the size of the region in which they are employed. In 1960the Royal Commission recommended that the maximum of the scale of remuneration paid to senior administrative medical officers in the largestregions should be the same as that of the whole-time consultant with a Cdistinction award; this was a return to a relativity which was first establishedby an arbitration award in 1951. Other administrative medical staff were toreceive increases proportionate to those which resulted from this recom-mendation for senior administrative medical officers in the largest regions.The resulting salary scales were increased by 14 per cent, following our reportin 1963.140. The profession represented to us that the responsibilities of medicaladministrators had greatly increased in recent years, particularly in connectionwith work on the Hospital Plan. They also suggested that administrativemedical work was failing to attract a regular flow of suitable applicants, partly because most medical men preferred a clinical career and the salaries were not sufficiently attractive to induce some clinicians to turn to administrative work,and partly because other sources of recruitment to administrative medical staff,such as the Colonial Medical Service and the medical services of the armed
forces, were likely to be less productive of recruits to administrative medicalwork in the hospital service than in the past. For these reasons they proposedthat the scale for senior administrative medical officers in the largest regionsshould in future be related to that of a consultant with a B distinction award,and that the salaries of other administrative medical officers should be increasedproportionately.141. Though the workload falling on the administrative medical staff has undoubtedly increased, the number of doctors doing this work has also increased considerably: the senior administrative medical officer in each regionnow has a much larger force of subordinate staff to assist him than in the early days. We were informed by the Health Departments that vacancies in thehigher grades in this class could readily be filled from lower grades, and thatthis was now in practice the way in which the top posts were filled. There was thus less need than in the past to be able to attract consultants out of clinicalwork into the higher ranks of administrative medical work in the hospital service.They also pointed out that the remuneration of administrative medical staff had to be considered in relation not only to the remuneration of clinical staffbut also in relation to lay administrators and other professional staff employedby regional hospital boards.142. It did not seem to us that a case for altering the relativities betweenclinical staff and administrative medical staff had been made out. We conclude that the salaries of administrative medical staff should continue to be based onthe existing relativities, and in particular that the salary for the senior administra-tive medical officer in a large region should be based on that of a whole-timeconsultant with a C distinction award. Accordingly we recommend for senioradministrative medical officers in the largest regions a scale running from 4,680 by two annual increments of  185 and four further annual increments of 190 to a maximum of  5,810, and we recommend that the salary scales forother administrative medical staff should be revised by agreement between the health Departments and the profession^ representatives, so as broadly tomaintain existing relativities.Ophthalmic medical practitioners143. Ophthalmic medical practitioners are doctors under contract withOphthalmic Service Committees of Executive Councils to test sight. At theend of September 1964 there were 739 of them: 69 were general medical practitioners, 206 were part-time consultants (another one was both a general medical practitioner and a part-time consultant), and many of the rest hadhospital appointments in other grades. Ophthalmic medical practitioners are paid by fees per test; the fee is made up of three elements, one of net remunera-tion (at present 17s. 6d.), a second in lieu of employers&apos; superannuation contri-bution (at present Is. 6d.), and a third in respect of expenses. Our concern is withthe first element.144. The net remuneration element has since 1957 been related to themean of the minimum of the senior hospital medical officer scale and the maxi-mum of the consultant scale. This has perhaps reflected the fact that under theold medical staffing structure posts in the Hospital Eye Service which were concerned only with refraction were graded senior hospital medical officer,
while the ophthalmic medical practitioner, though concerned only with re-fraction, is an independent contractor and does not work under consultantsupervision. The Health Departments argued that, since the senior hospital medical officer grade would not continue to be part of the permanent staffingstructure, it was no longer appropriate to rely upon the relationship whichhad since 1957 determined the net remuneration element in the ophthalmicmedical practitioners fee. They considered that the most appropriate relation-ship was with the medical assistant, or possibly with the midpoint of the com-bined medical assistant and consultant scales; and they accepted the implication that this would mean a reduction, or at best no change, in the fee. They con-sidered that the fee was too high at present for the nature of the service per-formed: the full medical qualification was not essential for the purpose oftesting sight, and the doctors concerned would be able to employ their skill and qualifications more fully, and therefore more usefully, in other work inthe ophthalmic service.145. The profession^ representatives pointed out that the fact that entry tothe senior hospital medical officer grade had been closed in no way altered the status or skill of ophthalmic medical practitioners, or the nature of their work. There was no other evidence that standards of entry or of performancehad fallen. They did not accept that the ophthalmic medical practitionersmedical qualifications were not usefully employed: they were better qualifiedthan ophthalmic opticians (who also test sight) to diagnose abnormal orpathological conditions; and, though as ophthalmic medical practitioners theywere precluded from themselves treating people sent to them for sight tests,they were able to advise the patient to see his own general practitioner, and thegeneral practitioner what course of action or treatment to follow. The professiontherefore proposed that the net remuneration element in the ophthalmic medical practitioners fee should continue to be related to the midpoint between theminimum of the senior hospital medical officer scale and the maximum of theconsultant scale, so that ophthalmic medical practitioners&apos; net remunerationwould be increased pro rata with other rates of remuneration for doctors of similar standing.146. We find needlessly artificial the convention of relating this fee to this or that point on some other scale of remuneration, and we have tried to con-sider the matter on its own merits. It seems that both the Health departments and the profession thought that the existing relationship produced a reasonablerate of remuneration in 1957, and there has not been any change in the dutiesor in the nature of the work that would justify a radical change in this fee ascompared with other rates at this sort of level. Without seeking to confirm orestablish any precise relationship for the future, we recommend that the netremuneration element in the ophthalmic medical practitioner&apos;s fee should from 1st April 1966 be 18s. 6d., plus Is. 6d. in lieu of employers&apos; superannuationcontribution and a further sum in respect of expenses to be agreed between the health Departments and the profession^ representatives.
CHAPTER VIREMUNERATION OF GENERAL MEDICAL PRACTITIONERSThe new system147. The proposals put to us by the Health Departments and by the repre-sentatives of the profession on the remuneration of general practitioners are,as we have already said, related to a radically altered system of remunerationwhich has necessitated a different approach to the problem of general practi-petitioner remuneration from that which we have followed in previous reports.148. The existing system of remuneration was described in some detail inour Fifth Report,25 and we do not propose to repeat that description. Briefly,remuneration is paid out of a pool. The money credited to the pool consists ofa prescribed average net income (which means in this context gross earningsless expenses chargeable as deductions for tax purposes) for every principal inthe general medical services who is under 70 years of age and who providesunrestricted services, plus a sum intended to represent practice expenses incurred by those doctors. The main payments out of the pool are capitation fees of so much for each patient on a doctor&apos;s list, with loading payments for patientsfrom the 501st to the 1,700th on the list of a doctor in partnership and fromthe 401st to the 1,600th on the list of a single-handed doctor. A number of other payments also come out of the pool, notably those for maternity medical services, dispensing of drugs and dressings by doctors, mileage payments to ruralpractitioners, fees for general medical services to temporary residents, and payments for the training of trainee assistants. Following our Fifth Report,payments to general practitioners by hospital authorities, local authorities and government Departments were excluded from the pool for 1965-66.149. Our main role in this system of remuneration has been to determine the average net income to be credited to the pool. The Health departments and the profession have then agreed on the sum to be credited to the poolfor practice expenses (on the basis of sample inquiries into income tax returns)and upon the levels of the various fees and payments to be made out of the pool.150. The Government^ proposals for a new system of remuneration were published in October 1965, following discussions with the profession^ repre-sentatives, in a Second Report of Joint Discussions between general practi-petitioner representatives and the Minister of Health. In the words of that report:&quot; The proposals involve a fundamental recasting of the present system of remuneration, and in the Governmenfs view represent a major step forward in improving the conditions under which general practice is provided underthe National Health Service &quot;. The profession^ representatives have made itclear, both in the Second Report of Joint Discussions and in evidence to us,that they have no mandate to commit the profession to accepting the new system, though they acknowledge its merits. The profession have, however,26 Cmnd. 2585, published in February 1965.
agreed that the revised system of remuneration should come to the review body for recommendations on levels of payments. If agreement is reached onthe new methods and levels of payment, then the Government will agree to abolish the pool.151. The Charter for the Family Doctor Service, a document prepared bythe profession^ representatives which was the starting point of the discussions of the new system, suggested that general practitioners should be given a choice of payment by capitation fee, fee for item of service or some form of salary.The Government have stated that they are not at present satisfied that payment by fee for item of service is a feasible or desirable method of payment for thegeneral run of the doctor&apos;s work, though they have said that they are willingto consider further with the profession whether mutually acceptable safeguardscan be devised for a limited experiment. We have not been asked to consideror make recommendations upon levels of payments under such a system.152. The Government have agreed that payment by salary is a suitablemethod of payment for family doctor services in some circumstances. Theyconsider, however, that this method would be appropriate only where doctorswere practising from premises provided by the National Health Service (or bylocal authorities) and where practice expenses were being directly met by theservice, rather than being provided by the practitioner and reimbursed by theservice. Payment by salary is not expected to be appropriate where the doctor isproviding his own premises, staff and equipment, and where he works alongsidedoctors paid by fees. It is most likely to be suitable in the case of doctorspractising from health centres.153. There is to be further discussion between the Government and the profession on the detailed conditions of service which would accompanypayment by salary. We have been told that we shall be consulted about levels of payment when agreement has been reached upon other detailed conditions,but in the meantime we are not asked to make recommendations on levels of payment by salary.154. We are thus asked to relate our recommendations on levels of payment to a scheme, which has been discussed in detail between the Health departments and the profession^ representatives, based upon a capitation fee. There are,however, a number of important differences between the new system proposed and the existing system:(1) The existing loading payments will disappear.(2) Part of remuneration will be paid in the form of a basic practice allow-ance, to be paid in full to all unrestricted principals who have lists of atleast 1,000 patients (or are members of partnerships with an average listof at least 1,000 patients per doctor) and who make themselves availablefor general medical services within normal hours for certain minimumperiods each week. The allowance will be scaled down for doctors who do not satisfy these conditions.(3) A standard capitation fee per patient on list will be paid in respect of services other than those given at night and at weekends.(4) The standard capitation fee will be higher in respect of patients aged- sixty-five and over than in respect of other patients, to recognise thefact that elderly patients need more attention from their doctors.
(5) There will be additional payments for doctors undertaking services at night and at weekends: a &quot; stand-by &quot; payment, payable at a flat rate likethe basic practice allowance and subject to the same conditions, a supplementary capitation fee for patients in excess of 1,000 on the list(in excess of 1,000 per doctor on the combined lists of doctors in partner-ship), and a fee for each visit requested and made between midnight and7.00 a.m.(6) There will be additions to the basic practice allowance for practice inunattractive areas, practice in groups, vocational training before entry into practice, for seniority (provided that attendance at post-graduatetraining is maintained), and for special experience and service to general practice. All these additional allowances except that for group practicewill be scaled down (like the practice allowances) for doctors with lists of less than 1,000 patients and doctors who devote less than a specifiedamount of time to general practice under the National Health Service.Doctors with lists of less than 1,000 patients will not be eligible foreven part payment of the allowance for group practice.(7) A post-graduate training allowance on the lines of the present scheme will be retained.(8) There will be separate fees for services carried out in pursuance ofpublic policy.(9) Reasonable expenditure on rents and rates for surgery premises will be directly reimbursed.(10) Up to 70 per cent, of expenditure on ancillary help will be directlyreimbursed.(11) There will be arrangements for additional payments (subject to certain conditions) during periods of sickness when it is necessary to employ alocum or other deputy from outside the practice.155. In addition to these payments, general practitioners will continue tobe eligible as at present for fees for maternity medical services, temporaryresident fees, emergency treatment fees, certain anaesthetic fees and ruralpractice payments. Modifications in the arrangements for remunerating thedispensing of drugs and dressings by general practitioners have been underdiscussion between the Health Departments and the representatives of the profession.156. General practitioners in the general medical service will also continueto be able to undertake work for hospital authorities, local authorities and government departments (payments for which were excluded from the poolfollowing our Fifth Report), and to carry on private practice. For all these services they will continue to be separately remunerated.157. From our point of view there is one further major difference betweenthe new system and the old. Instead of asking us to fix an average net income and themselves agreeing upon rates of payment to produce that average net income, the Health Departments and the profession^ representatives have invited us to recommend separately the levels of payment for at least the majoritems in the new system. Since these payments will be gross fees, it has been necessary for us to allow for practice expenses as well as net income in arriving at our recommendations.
158. As we understand it, the new system is designed to meet a number of requirements which many doctors have considered are not met, or are not sufficiently met, under the present system of remuneration. The basic practiceallowance, for example, is intended to recognise that, while some practiceexpenses vary more or less proportionately with the size of list, others do not.It also recognises that the doctor&apos;s obligation in terms of time and availabilitydoes not vary directly with size of list: a doctor with a small list has to holdhimself available for a certain number of surgery sessions each week and hasto be on call for his patients at other times, just as a doctor with a large listhas to do. Then again, the introduction of separate payments for services at night or weekends will provide some financial recognition for those doctors no doubt the great majority who continue to undertake &quot; round-the-clock &quot;responsibility, and at the same time make it possible for some doctors to be relieved of the responsibility and the remuneration for providing service at night and weekends, if they so wish and if arrangements can be made to covertheir patients at those times. In these and other ways payments under the new system will be more directly related to the incidence of work, responsibility and expense than payments under the previous system.159. The introduction of seniority payments will recognise the developmentof experience in the general practitioner, and will provide him with the prospectof maintaining the level of his remuneration at a time when he may wish withadvancing age to begin to curtail his responsibilities or reduce his workload.160. So far we have been dealing with payments in respect of aspects ofgeneral practice or conditions of a doctor&apos;s life which are not new, though theyhave not been separately identified in terms of special payments. We now cometo the payments which are new, in the sense that they recognise particularaspects of practice or qualities of individual doctors in a way that has nothappened before. Some of these payments are in the nature of incentive pay-ments: for instance, the additional payments for practice in chronically under-doctored areas and for practice in groups. Other payments seek to providehigher remuneration for those doctors who have established a claim to beregarded as especially good doctors, by virtue of special training, qualifications,experience or service to general practice.161. The direct reimbursement of expenditure on practice premises and ofthe greater part of expenditure on ancillary help will at once help to removesome of the manifest inequities in the present system of distribution, where thereimbursement of practice expenses is related to size of list rather than to individual expenditure, and will serve as an encouragement to those doctors who spend more on their practice premises and on ancillary help. We welcomethese proposals, which will in our view constitute an important improvementin the conditions of general practice and provide some assistance towards the changes in organisation which we believe are needed if general practice is tobe able to cope with the demands of the population for medical care.The evidence of the profession^ representatives and of the Health Departments162. The representatives of the practitioners submitted a memorandum ofevidence in which they proposed levels for each of the payments under thenew system. In their oral evidence they explained to us how they had arrived
at their figures. They had first redistributed within the new system the sumsdistributed in the main payments made under the existing system. They made provision in their proposed basic practice allowance for expenses which do notvary proportionately with size of list and in their standard capitation fee for expenses which do vary in proportion with size of list. They excluded thoseexpenses which are at present reimbursed through capitation fees but will be directly reimbursed or otherwise covered under the new system. They alsoexcluded those expenses incurred in connection with work for hospital authori-ties, local authorities and Government departments, and expenses incurred inconnection with private practice, which have hitherto been included in thetotal practice expenses credited to the pool. They treated the proposed supple-mentary payments for night and weekend services as being in effect overtimerates by deducting the &quot; day equivalent&quot; from their standard capitation fee,so that only the overtime element would rank as additional remuneration.After allowing for all these adjustments they redistributed the rest of theamount at present paid out in capitation fees, loading payments and finalbalance payments mainly into the new standard capitation fee but partly intothe basic practice allowance.163. They then added to the sums already included under the heading ofthe basic practice allowance an amount for holiday and study leave (whichwe were asked to identify separately so that it could be paid, if the doctor sowished, at the time leave was taken), and a sum to compensate the doctor andhis family for the fact that every doctor has to hold himself available for acertain number of surgery sessions and calls outside surgery hours irrespective of list size, and for the intrusion that these arrangements in many cases makeinto the private life not only of the doctor himself but also of his family.164. These elements in the basic practice allowance for holiday and studyleave and for compensation for availability were regarded as new items, neithercovered by the existing system nor taken into account hitherto in fixing levels of remuneration. So also was the overtime element in the payments for night and weekend work. All the payments described as additions to the basic practiceallowance those for practice in unattractive areas, practice in groups, andthose for seniority, experience and special qualifications were regarded as new payments, as also were the fees for items of service in pursuance of public policy and the special sickness payments.165. By the time they came to submit their evidence the general practitioners&apos;.representatives knew that the Health Departments were suggesting that weshould on this occasion make recommendations to stand for two (ratherthan three) years. They welcomed this proposal, and accordingly suggested for the basic practice allowance and the other new payments levels whichthey regarded as appropriate for the period from 1966 to 1968. For the standardcapitation fee, however, they suggested the level at which it would have been inOctober 1964, if the existing amount of remuneration had been redistributed inthe new system in the manner which they suggested was appropriate and if all the items which in their submission were new had been treated as requiring addi-tional remuneration. They invited us to apply to that figure, and to certain otherfees such as temporary resident fees, a &quot; betterment factor &quot; to raise them to
levels appropriate to the period from 1966 to 1968. They suggested that thesame betterment factor should be applied to the standard capitation fee forgeneral practitioners as was applied to the salaries of hospital doctors.166. In their oral evidence the representatives of the profession gave us afull account of the basis on which their case was presented. They told us thatgeneral practitioners were dissatisfied not only with the amount of their re-muneration but with their conditions of service and with the present methodof remuneration. On conditions of service they referred particularly to the diminution in the number of general practitioners and the increase in thepopulation, not only in terms of the need to reduce wastage but also in termsof the effect on individual workload. They also told us of factors which hadtended not only to increase the number of contacts between patient and doctorbut also to increase the amount of time spent by the doctor with or in relationto each patient. We have discussed these points in an earlier chapter.167. On the method of remuneration they explained that it had been a prime source of dissatisfaction under the pool system that workload and paywere unrelated. Moreover, though aggregate expenses were reimbursed in full,the distribution of the reimbursement was not related to the actual expenditureof individual practitioners. This penalised those who spent more than theaverage amount on their practices in order to give a better service to theirpatients. It was a further source of dissatisfaction that the more work doctorsundertook outside general practice, the less was available for remuneration for general medical services. That source of dissatisfaction had been at leastpartly alleviated by the Review Body&apos;s exclusion from the pool of payments by hospital authorities, local authorities and Government departments; butit remained a defect of the pool system that individual doctors could increase their own earnings only at the expense of their colleagues, because of the limits on the total amount in the pool. They explained that doctors felt that underthe present system there was no adequate recognition of the continuous respon-sibility laid upon them; the general practitioner had to offer an option on theentirety of his time and energy, in a way and to an extent which were not expected in any other profession.168. Dissatisfaction with the method of remuneration was coupled with a feeling that the remuneration of general practitioners had fallen seriouslybehind that in comparable professions and behind salary incomes generally.On this score the representatives of the general practitioners relied upon thesame evidence as the representatives of the hospital medical and dental staff.169. The profession^ representatives emphasised that the Government^hope that the new system would represent a major step forward in improvingconditions in general practice would be realised only if additional funds weremade available. Many of the statements made by the Government, in discussions with representatives of the general practitioners and in public, would in the profession^ view be a mere mockery if they intended no more than a redistribution-tion of the funds at present available under different headings. In the pro-fession&apos;s view many of the payments proposed were completely new, andcovered items which had not hitherto been paid for or taken into account indecisions on remuneration.
170. The profession^ representatives suggested that it was for the review body to form an independent view upon the relevant economic considerations,without being bound by statements of Government policy; but they claimed that in any event their proposals could be justified within the framework ofthe White Paper on Prices and Incomes Policy26. We should not be put off,they suggested, by considerations of increased cost; if a certain increase in remuneration was necessary to maintain general practice within the national health Service, it was for the Government to decide how to find the money.They added that on their estimates the total cost of their proposals would beno greater than the cost of the recent abolition of prescription charges.171. The Health Departments emphasised that the system and the amount of remuneration were logically separable: it would be possible to redistribute thepresent amount of aggregate gross remuneration under the new system, and we might think it right to have regard to the level of remuneration that would result from the sums we recommended for the various payments under the newcontract. None the less they recognised that considerations of manpower andworkload were very relevant to the determination of the level of remuneration and might justify an increase that was &quot; exceptional &quot; in terms of the prices and incomes policy. They did not suggest how much should be paid in totalremuneration to the profession, and they did not make precise suggestions forlevels of payments under the new system, though they gave indications of views in some instances; these matters were left for us to make up our minds about.172. The Health Departments argued that the burden of responsibility upondoctors included three factors which were the normal incidents of the doctor&apos;slife: the continuous responsibility for the patient, the special &quot; life and death &quot;responsibility, and the responsibilities which the doctor&apos;s work created for hisdomestic household. They considered that all these factors had been taken intoaccount in assessing remuneration in the past, though the current review inrelation to the new system gave the Review Body a new opportunity to reassessthe weight to be given to them.173. In particular, the Health Departments could not accept the profession^view that all the proposed additions to the basic practice allowance were completely new items of remuneration. The proposed seniority payments mustin their view be regarded as part of career earnings and thus as not by themselvesmeriting additional remuneration. On the other hand they agreed that theproposed payments for pre-entry vocational training and for special experience and service to general practice would be new. Both the Royal Commission and,in their Fifth Report, the Review Body had indicated willingness to recommendadditional money for payments of this kind. The Health Departments would accept that these payments should be regarded as additional at this stage, thoughonce they had been introduced and established they would no doubt come to beregarded as part of career earnings.28 Cmnd. 2639, published in April 1965.
Our comments and conclusions174. As we have said, our task has for the first time been to consider and recommend levels of actual payments to doctors, not an average net income.In considering what sums to recommend for the payments in the new system of remuneration we have tried to determine an amount which we think is appro-priate to each, but we have not found it possible simply to deal with the systemitem by item and settle a level for each payment without regard to all the others.For many of the payments there are few or no objective criteria to determine what they should be; the judgment must be to some extent an arbitrary one.For instance, some of the payments are designed as incentives, but no one can say at this stage what level of payment will have the incentive desired becausethese incentives have not been tried in the past. Views were expressed to us bothby the Health Departments and by the representatives of the profession on thebalance between different elements in the new system, and we have carefully considered those views. We have also thought that we could not recommendlevels of payment under the new system without regard for the total effect of our proposals, both in terms of cost and in terms of reward to the doctor.175. With the abolition of the pool, average net income will cease to be themain determining factor in the system of remuneration. Moreover, withthe system of differential payments which the new arrangements provide, the concept of average net income becomes even less meaningful than in the past.It is an essential characteristic of the new system that the individual doctor&apos;sremuneration will depend not simply on the size of his list but also on a variety of other factors, including the type and standard of practice and his own qualifi-cations and experience. To try to state the effect of our proposals in terms of average net income would be to overlook the fact that, as compared with theexisting system, the new system will bring about a significant relative redistribution-tion of gross remuneration.176. There are two aspects of this redistributive effect to which we should like to draw particular attention. The first is that the new system inevitably and intentionally reduces the proportion of remuneration which is paidthrough capitation fees. Under the present system over 60 per cent, of grossremuneration is paid out in capitation fees, and another 20 per cent, in loadingpayments. Under the new system the standard and supplementary capitationfees together will account for less than half the total of gross remuneration.So the results of the new system cannot be assessed just by comparing thenew capitation fee with the old; and the amount of the new standard capitationfee does not represent our assessment of the total amount which a doctor shouldreceive for providing medical care for each patient on his list.177. The second point a related one also arises from the introduction ofthe basic practice allowance. The proposal is to have a basic practice allowancepayable at a standard rate to doctors with lists of 1,000 patients or more, andscaled down for doctors with smaller lists. In its operation it will therefore be notunlike a &quot; loading &quot; on the first 1,000 patients; indeed the Second Report of joint Discussions describes it as representing &quot; an extension of the principleof the present loading payments which it will replace &quot;. One effect of it will bethat a larger proportion of the aggregate remuneration for general practice
will be payable to doctors with small lists than under the existing system. In sofar as this recognises that some practice expenses do not vary directly with size of list and makes smaller lists relatively more remunerative than they are atpresent, it meets what we understand to be the objectives of the Health Depart-ments and the representatives of the profession. If, however, the basic practiceallowance were to be set at too high a level in relation to the capitation fee, itwould go too far in this direction, and doctors with small lists would be toofavourably remunerated as compared with colleagues with larger lists andconsequently a heavier workload. This would cut across another of the objec-tives, that of relating remuneration to workload. This is one of the considerationswe have had in mind in deciding what levels to recommend for the new payments.178. In considering the basic practice allowance and the standard capitationfee we have faced one major unresolved disagreement between the profession^representatives and the Health Departments on the interpretation of the docu-ments put before us relating to the new system.179. The general practitioners&apos; representatives proposed to us that the basicpractice allowance should include an element in respect of &quot; compensation which must inevitably be an arbitrary amount for the fact that every general practitioner providing unrestricted general medical services has to hold himselfavailable for a certain number of surgery sessions, etc., each week irrespective oflist size &quot;, and they indicated that this element was intended to cover the factthat the doctor&apos;s professional obligations in many cases caused &quot; a considerableintrusion into the private life of the doctor&apos;s family as well as his own &quot;. Thisproposal was associated in their memorandum of evidence with a reference to paragraph 21 of the First Report of Joint Discussions between general practi-petitioner representatives and the Minister of Health, dated 2nd June 1965. Thisparagraph stated that the proposed scheme for partial direct reimbursement of expenses incurred in the employment of ancillary staff would not apply topayments to wives (and other dependants) who assisted doctors in their practice,and went on to say:&quot; The Government and the profession recognise that the work of mostpractices intrudes upon the doctor&apos;s domestic arrangements, and theyhave agreed that the Review Body should be invited to consider whetherthis is a factor which could and should be taken into account when fixingrates of pay for the doctors themselves. If a solution on these lines provedfeasible it would then become inappropriate to make payments for wives and other dependants in addition, whether these were based on sumsallowed as deductions for tax purposes or otherwise.&quot;It was also associated with a reference to the Second Report of Joint discussions between general practitioner representatives and the Minister of Health, setting, out the Governmenfs proposals for the new system, in which it was statedthat the basic practice allowance was &quot; intended as a payment to recognise the continuous responsibility (including the responsibility devolving on a wife ordependent relative) and basic expenditure entailed in general medical practicewithin the normal working week.&quot;180. The Health Departments told us that their intention in these references&apos; arid specifically in the reference to &quot; intrusion upon domestic arrangements &quot;in paragraph 21 of the First Report was that we should be asked to take into
account in fixing the basic practice allowance the sort of help that membersof a doctor&apos;s household give to the practice, not in a regular or systematicway but informally and intermittently (answering telephone calls and so on),and the payments which many doctors make to their wives (or some other person in their households) in recognition of this help and are able to includeas practice expenses for tax purposes. They also said that many doctors&apos; wivesgave their husbands &quot; ancillary help &quot; in the practice in a more extensive andsystematic way, and were (or could be) paid accordingly. They had not beenable to think of a satisfactory way of covering payments for services of thiskind in the scheme for direct reimbursement of expenses on ancillary help,and they accepted that, if the Review Body agreed to take account of whatwas described in paragraph 21 of the First Report of Joint Discussions as&quot; intrusion upon domestic arrangements &quot; in fixing remuneration, they should allow for the fact that some payments to doctors&apos; wives were in respect of thismore extensive assistance. In the Health Departments&apos; view it was inconsistent with the intentions embodied in paragraph 21 of the First Report of joint discussions that the profession^ representatives had provided for &quot; payments to wives and other dependants &quot; within their proposals for the standard capita-tion fee, as well as including in the basic practice allowance an amount for&quot; compensation for availability and domestic disturbance &quot; which was asso-ciated with a reference to paragraph 21 of the First Report of Joint Discussions.181. The Health Departments also made clear their view that, althoughone of the factors in recognition of which they had proposed a basic practiceallowance was that (as the Second Report of Joint Discussions put it):&quot; [every practitioner] has to hold himself available for a certain number ofsurgery sessions, etc., each week,.. . irrespective of the size of his list&quot;,this was not in their view to be regarded as a new factor which had never been taken into account before: it was one of the basic and unchanging obliga-tions which had always been recognised and taken into account in fixingremuneration.182. The representatives of the profession put a different interpretation onthese matters. They said that a doctor who actually paid his wife or dependantwas paying for skilled work of some kind in a medical, nursing or secretarialcapacity. In addition to that doctors&apos; wives or dependants inevitably, by reasonof being members of the family, had to shoulder work and responsibility forwhich they were not paid; this embraced the sort of help given in dealing withtelephone calls and so on, particularly when the doctor was out on a visit orcall. They considered that no account was taken in the existing system of remuneration of this sort of intrusion into the life of the doctofs family. Thustheir argument for rewarding &quot; intrusion upon domestic arrangements &quot; in the basic practice allowance as a new factor not hitherto taken into account inthe system of remuneration, in addition to reimbursing payments to wives andother dependants in the standard capitation fee, rested on the premises that allpayments to wives and other dependants were in respect of skilled work ofsome kind and that doctors&apos; wives and dependants were not being paid for anyhelp they might intermittently and informally give to the practice by way ofdealing with telephone calls and in other similar ways.
183. This disagreement has been of some significance for us, because if the health Departments&apos; view is correct there is an appreciable element of doublecounting in the proposals put to us by the profession, whose proposed standardcapitation fee included about Is. 3d. (equivalent to about  150 per doctor on average) for payments to wives or other dependants in addition to  300 inthe basic practice allowance as &quot; compensation for availability and domesticdisturbance &quot;. We find the profession^ interpretation difficult to reconcile withthe clear statement in paragraph 21 of the First Report of Joint Discussions that,if the Review Body considered that &quot; intrusion upon domestic arrangements &quot;was a factor that could and should be taken into account when fixing rates of pay for doctors themselves, it would then become inappropriate to make payments for wives and other dependants in addition. It must also be said thatour impression is that it is by no means uncommon for doctors to make pay-ments to their wives (or other dependants) not just for systematic assistance tothe practice on the basis of special skills or qualifications but for help givenintermittently and informally in various ways.184. For the purposes of our report, however, we have not found it necessaryto press the Health Departments and the profession^ representatives to resolvethis disagreement between them; we need do no more than state the view whichwe have taken of the matter, in terms which we hope will make our intentionsclear. We consider that the obligation of continuous responsibility, with all its implications for the life of the doctor and his family, cannot be regarded as anew factor in general practitioner remuneration, now being taken into account for the first time. It has been one of the basic features in general practice formany years certainly since 1948 and we believe that it was one of the factors in the minds of the Royal Commission in referring to differences in the &quot; natureof the work and responsibility &quot; and &quot; the advantages and disadvantagesinherent in the lives of doctors and dentists &quot; in Chapter V of their Report. Wehave certainly had in mind and the need to consider this specific problem has brought to the forefront of our attention the obligation of continuous responsi-bility, with all its implications, as an important feature in the life of a general practitioner. We do not, however, regard this as something which can be separated and recognised by a single distinct payment or part of a payment. It isone of the basic conditions of the doctor&apos;s work, and so must colour all thinkingabout his remuneration. The burdensomeness of this obligation must vary insome degree, if not in strict proportion, with the number of patients for whomthe doctor is responsible. Moreover it clearly varies according to whether heundertakes responsibility for &quot; out-of-hours &quot; work or not. So far as the new system of remuneration is concerned, this obligation has in our view to be takeninto account in fixing the supplementary payments for doctors who undertakefull responsibility including night and weekend work, as well as in fixing the basicpractice allowance and standard capitation fee which will go to all doctors,including those who contract out of the obligation of continuous responsibility.185. In formulating our recommendations, therefore, we have taken full account of the obligation of continuous responsibility, with all its implications for the life of the doctor and his family, though it is not to be found indentified in connection with any one single payment; we have also taken into account the fact that payments to wives and other dependants will not be included in the
1 o1 h,scheme for direct reimbursement of expenditure on ancillary help, and so willhave to be met out of the remuneration from other payments.186. We have been invited to include in the basic practice allowance anamount which recognises that the doctor is entitled to a period of leave eachyear for holidays and study, during which he will need either to employ alocum or to arrange for his patients to be cared for by a deputy for whom hewill himself have to stand in on another occasion. No particular period is to bestipulated, but the Government have accepted that for the majority of practi-practitioners a total of six weeks a year for holiday and study would not be unreason-able. We are asked to identify separately the amount included in the basicpractice allowance on this account, so that arrangements may be made for the doctor to receive it, if he so wishes, at the time when leave is taken rather than aspart of his regular quarterly or monthly payments.187. Hitherto aggregate gross remuneration has included actual payments tolocums for holiday cover, through the practice expenses credited to the pool,but these payments have not been directly reimbursed to the doctors whoincurred them. There have also been arrangements for direct payments towardthe cost of employing a locum when the doctor attends a refresher course, butas this is now to be covered by the basic practice allowance these arrangements will be discontinued.188. At present many doctors do not employ locums when they go on holiday(there would not be enough locums to go round if all doctors employed them),but have reciprocal arrangements with other doctors. In these circumstances nomoney payment normally passes: each doctor &quot; pays &quot; his deputy by services in kind. In future similar arrangements will no doubt continue to be made; but now the remuneration of each doctor will include an amount which he can draw,if he wishes, when he takes holiday or study leave. It will be for doctors whomake reciprocal arrangements to decide whether to exchange money payments ornot. But, whichever way individual doctors settle this between themselves, thenew arrangement will recognise that a doctor going on leave has either to pay alocum in money or to pay a colleague in kind.189. It has always been recognised, as one facet of the obligation of con-tinuous responsibility, that a doctor is responsible for seeing that his patients arecared for while he is away. A reciprocal arrangement between colleagues can beregarded as in some ways the parallel in the general medical service of thearrangements that are made in other walks of life for a man&apos;s work to be lookedafter by his colleagues when he goes on holiday, without additional payments bythe employer. In many other walks of life, however, a man can so organise hisaffairs as to bring forward or postpone work; he can thus deal himself with matters which cannot be deputed and so ease the burden that falls on hiscolleagues while he is away. Even the general dental practitioner can deal with much of his work in this way, leaving only emergencies arising while he is awayto be dealt with by a colleague. The general medical practitioner, however, hasmuch less scope for organising his work in this way. If he goes away, his patientsare generally speaking going to need medical attention just as much as if he was there, and he cannot do very much to bring forward or postpone their require-ments. This means not only that the doctor who goes on leave must provideI *
adequate cover but that the doctor who deputises for him accepts a real increasein responsibility and workload.190. Though we think that this facet of the collective and individual obliga-tions of continuous responsibility must have been in people&apos;s minds whenremuneration has been considered in the past, we have welcomed the opportunity -unity and the reason for reassessing its significance on this occasion. We havetaken full account of it in formulating our recommendations. There is, however,no necessary connection between on the one hand the question of principlewhether an allowance should be made for this factor in determining levels of remuneration (and if so how much), and on the other hand the administrativequestion whether a doctor should be able to draw part of his remuneration forthe year in a single sum, if he so wishes, when he goes on leave. We should see noobjection to a doctor being allowed to receive some part of his basic practiceallowance for the year in a single payment at the time when he goes on leave, if itsuits him to do so, and subject to whatever safeguards are necessary to ensurethat he is not overpaid for the year as a whole. We leave this for further discus-sion between the Health Departments and the representatives of the profession.191. There were one or two minor disagreements between the health departments and the representatives of the profession on the arrangements forscaling down the basic practice allowance and the additional allowances for doctors who do not qualify for payment at full rates because they have lists of less than 1,000 patients. The profession^ representatives envisaged a series ofbanded rates, diminishing progressively but not necessarily in strict proportion as list size diminished; the Health Departments envisaged scaling down indirect proportion to size of list. Doctors with lists of less than 100 patientswould in any case not be entitled to any of these allowances. The profession^proposal seems to us to be more consistent with the nature and purpose of the allowance; the Health Departments&apos; proposal, on the other hand, would avoid the risk that the loss of one patient could result in a disproportionatelylarge loss of earnings, if its effect was to move the doctor from a higher to a lower rate-band. On the whole our view would be that the allowance (and the additions) should be scaled down pari passu with the size of list from the full rate at 1,000 patients to a figure somewhat greater than one-tenth of the full rate at 100 patients.192. This approach would certainly seem to be appropriate for the supple-mentary practice allowance. The Second Report of Joint Discussions envisaged that this allowance would be a supplement to the basic practice allowance,payable under the same conditions and scaled down in the same way. the profession^ representatives argued that, since this allowance was to be a stand-by payment and the obligation to stand by was something which did not varywith list size, it should be paid in full to all doctors who undertook &quot; out-of-hours &quot; responsibilities. This argument seems to us to overlook the point that,since supplementary capitation fees will not be payable on the first 1,000 patientson a list, the supplementary practice allowance is related not only to the obliga-tion to stand by but also to the work done for the first 1,000 patients. Thissuggests that it would be reasonable to scale down the supplementary practiceallowance pari passu with the size of list from the full rate for a list of 1,000patients to a minimum rate greater than one-tenth of the full rate for a list of100 patients.
193. As these disagreements came to our notice, we have thought it right toexpress our views on them. Clearly, however, the exact arrangements for scalingdown the allowances for doctors who are not entitled to receive them at the full rate will require careful consideration if anomalies are to be avoided. Ratherthan attempt ourselves to work out these arrangements, we think that they are better left for discussion between the Health Departments and the representativesof the practitioners in the light of the views we have expressed.194. In assessing levels of payment for the various fees and allowances underthe new system, we have taken into account all the considerations of manpower and workload which we discussed in Chapter IV, bearing in mind that similar considerations were the main factors which led us to recommend an increaseof nearly 10 per cent, in average net income in our Fifth Report a year ago. Wehave also taken the opportunity of thinking afresh about the even less measurablebut none the less important considerations of the special nature of the doctor&apos;responsibility which were referred to in evidence before us. In addition to thevarious matters to which we have referred earlier in this chapter, we have also had in mind the more detailed considerations set out in the paragraphs which follow.195. The Health Departments told us that in their view the basic practiceallowance should form a substantial, but not the major, element in the remunera-tion of a doctor with an average sized list, and suggested that it should be atleast one-third of the sum of the basic practice allowance and standard capitationfees for such a doctor. We have set the allowance at a level which will be slightly less than one-third of gross remuneration from this allowance and the standardcapitation fee for a doctor with an average list, in order that we should not haveto reduce levels of other payments below what we think reasonable.196. The Second Report of Joint Discussions suggested that the standardcapitation fee for patients over sixty-five might be one-third higher than forother patients. The profession^ representatives put their suggested capitationfee 50 per cent, higher for patients over sixty-five than for other patients, on thebasis of statistical evidence that consultation rates were half as high again for patients of sixty-five and over. As the profession^ representatives themselves have suggested in another context, consultation rates do not provide very firmor precise indicators of workload. In our view the proportion suggested by the profession makes for too large a differential, and we recommend a standardcapitation fee for patients over sixty-five which is 140 per cent, of the fee forother patients.197. The Health Departments suggested that payments for &quot; out-of-hours &quot;responsibilities should not be so high as to produce disproportionate remunera-tion compared with responsibilities at other times, but high enough to ensurethat sufficient doctors were willing to undertake such work. They suggested thatstand-by, capitation and night visit payments together might amount to some12.4 to 15 per cent, of the sum of the key payments in the new system (the basicpractice allowance, the standard capitation fees and the payments for &quot; out-of-hours &quot; responsibilities). In their oral evidence, by way of qualifying theirwritten evidence, their representatives indicated that they considered the bottom
of this range more appropriate than the top. Such statistical evidence as there isabout the proportion of &quot; out-of-hours &quot; work to work during &quot; normal&quot;hours suggests that the proportion of consultations out of hours is appreciablyless than 12J per cent, of total consultations. The relative volume of work is,however, by no means the only consideration to be taken into account. Wehave decided to make recommendations which will have the result thatremuneration for &quot; out-of-hours &quot; responsibilities will account for a slightlysmaller proportion of total remuneration from key payments than that suggestedby the Health Departments and about the same proportion as that which wouldhave resulted from the profession^ proposals.198. When we were asked last year to consider the introduction of senioritypayments, we made clear our view that, if the concept of payment for senioritywere to be adopted, it would require radical changes in the present arrange-ments for payment to general practitioners. This condition is now in process ofbeing satisfied. We also made it clear that our figure of average net income was based on an assessment of what total earnings should be over the whole of thepractitioners career, and therefore allowed already for differences between general practitioners and other professional men in the pattern of careerearnings. It follows from this that we have not been able to regard senioritypayments as new and extra remuneration.199. The new system will, however, also include additions to the basicpractice allowance for vocational training before entry to practice, and forspecial experience and service to general practice. In considering these items wehave had in mind the views of the Royal Commission on the desirability of some system of differential remuneration to recognise distinguished general practice.Nor have we forgotten our own indication, in our Fifth Report, that we should welcome an arrangement whereby the first-rate practitioner might be able to earn well above the average net income without taking on an excessively largelist, and our readiness to recommend, in order to finance a suitable scheme, asum substantially greater than that recommended by the Royal Commission.The proposed allowances for pre-entry vocational training and for special experience and service to general practice would be very much in line with what we have envisaged, and we have thought it right to regard these as truly addi-tional allowances, covering aspects of general practice which have not been recognised in the system of remuneration until now. The Health Departmentsagreed that we should not on this occasion regard these as being included incareer earnings, and we have regarded them as additional to the increasedremuneration which we have thought it right to recommend on other grounds.200. The profession^ representatives have invited us to consider whether a doctor who is entitled to the annual allowance for vocational training before&apos;entry to practice, which would run until he became entitled to a senioritypayment (and therefore for about ten years), should be allowed to commuteit for a lump sum payable on entry into practice. We see the attractions of a lump sum payable on entry into practice, when there may be heavy initialexpenses to meet. It is therefore with some regret that we have concluded that to try to combine that idea with an allowance for pre-entry vocational trainingwould raise too many difficulties and anomalies for the attempt to be worthmaking. So we recommend an annual allowance only. We also recommend that
doctors who acquired the necessary qualifications and entered general practicebefore 1st April 1966 should be entitled to receive this allowance (if they alsomeet the qualifications of list size and periods of duty in general medical service)from 1st April 1966.201. The representatives of the general practitioners made it clear that theyhad no mandate to agree to payments for special experience and service topractice. They were, however, able to suggest levels at which these paymentsmight be set if they were included in the new system of remuneration. the health Departments think that the case for these payments is so strong that thenew system should contain provision for them; indeed, they have made cleartheir view that they regard these payments as a necessary complement to pay-ments for seniority. We share the Health Departments&apos; view of their value, andin commending them to the profession we wish to emphasise again that theyreally are additional payments: if they were not included in the system, weshould recommend that the money which would have been used for them shouldnot be available, rather than that it should be distributed in other ways.202. The Second Report of Joint Discussions proposed that these payments should be made to selected doctors over the age of 45 and in receipt of a senioritypayment, and should not normally be payable beyond the age of 65. It wassuggested that about 30 per cent, of those within the field should be selected toreceive the payments, and that there should be two levels of payment, thehigher of which would go to a very limited number of doctors. The health departments and the profession^ representatives both suggested that thereshould be 3,000 payments at the lower level and 100 at the higher. The pro-fession&apos;s representatives proposed that the payments should be the same as theC and B distinction awards for consultants; the Health Departments suggestedthat the lower payment might be about  500 and the higher about  1,500.203. We are not convinced that the field of selection for these payments should be limited to doctors aged between 45 and 65. Though distinction ingeneral practice no doubt comes partly from experience, the sort of distinctionwhich these payments will recognise could in some cases emerge well before a doctor reached the age of 45. We do not make a formal recommendation onthis, which is something to be settled between the Health Departments and the profession^ representatives; but it would in our view be preferable that eligibility for these payments should not be formally limited by age. Furthermore, wethink that it would be a mistake to link these payments at all closely, either interms of number or value, to distinction awards for consultants; that might betaken to imply that these payments will be more like distinction awards forconsultants than we think they will in practice prove to be. For these reasons weare recommending different numbers and values for the payments than thosewhich have been suggested to us; but the payments we recommend will, we hopeand believe, constitute an appreciable recognition of distinction in general practice.204. The Second Report of Joint Discussions proposes to retain a separatepayment, on the lines of the present post-graduate education scheme, for doctors who attend a prescribed number of sessions of approved post-graduate trainingover a stated period. The allowance is at present  12 a year for five years,payable in one lump sum during the period. We are recommending a new rate of
payment, but this is clearly not a new type of payment. The Health Departmentsproposed that entitlement to this allowance should lapse on entitlement toseniority payment. We recommend that a doctor who is in receipt of a post-graduate education allowance at the time when he first becomes entitled to aseniority payment should continue to receive that allowance for whateverremains of the five year period for which it runs, but that no doctor should startreceiving a post-graduate education allowance, or start on a new five-year period if he has already been in receipt of an allowance, after he has become entitled to a seniority payment.205. Though rather different considerations apply to the allowance forgroup practice (which will be payable only to doctors with lists of 1,000 patientsor more) and for practice in unattractive areas, we think that both must beregarded as new and extra items, not hitherto recognised in the system of remuneration. The allowance for group practice is intended to provide a financial incentive to doctors to embark upon group practice from centralsurgery premises. The group practice interest-free loan scheme has providedsome incentive in the past. That has not, however, been a charge on the poolsince 1960; moreover, even though it is now to lapse, its place will be takenby the scheme for direct reimbursement of expenditure on practice premises,which will mean that the cost of raising capital for group practice premises willbe directly reimbursed. The proposed allowance is thus strictly additional.Group practice is one of the main ways in which general practice can be re-organised so as to provide a better service for the patients and a better life forthe doctors. It might seem that it should for this reason be attractive to doctorswithout further financial incentive. Both the Health Departments and the profession^ representatives agree, however, that some incentive is needed to accelerate the growth of group practice, which can (particularly at the outset)involve increased practice expenses. In fixing the level of this allowance we have borne in mind that it is not the only financial advantage of group practice: a group practice is better able to maintain good premises and employ ancillaryhelp, expenditure on both of which is now to be reimbursed direct. We have alsoborne in mind that the provision of better standards of service by means ofgroup practice tends, according to the evidence put before us, to increase theuse that patients make of the service.206. The additional allowance for practice in &quot; designated &quot; areas is a straight inducement payment; it has no parallel in the existing system of remuneration, and so far as we know the need to encourage practice in&quot; designated &quot; areas has not been a factor in previous thinking about thegeneral level of remuneration. Indeed an increase in payments to all doctorswould be no incentive to practise in particular areas. We thus regard this allowance as strictly additional. Any figure must be to some extent experimental;, we do not know what figure will act as an inducement, nor indeed how farreluctance to practise in these areas can be overcome by financial inducements.We have been mindful of the fact that an area which is &quot; designated &quot; now maynot stay so for ever, and we have recommended a level of payment which will,we hope, mean that the loss of earnings will not be catastrophically great ifqualification for the allowance ceases because the area ceases to be&quot; designated &quot;. We recommend that the amount of the allowance should notvary with the character of the area, as the Health Departments suggested it
might. In the Second Report of Joint Discussions it was stated that this allowance would be payable to doctors in areas which had been &quot; designated &quot; by theMedical Practices Committee for a period of three years up to the date of payment. We have not examined whether this is the appropriate criterion. Weshould regard any change in the criterion as a matter for discussion between the health Departments and the representatives of the profession. We recommend,however, that the criterion should be kept under review, in the light of require-ments for manning the service in different areas.207. We were invited to recommend a minimum fee for services carried outin pursuance of public policy, for instance the taking of cervical smears, vaccina-tions and immunisations. When evidence was given to us, discussions betweenthe Health Departments and the profession^ representatives had not gone far enough to establish what services were to be separately remunerated in this way.None the less the profession^ representatives told us that they would welcomea recommendation by the Review Body of a fee which they would regard for themoment as the standard fee, subject to negotiation with the Health departments for higher fees if some new and unusual work were introduced. Without knowingdefinitely what services are to be covered it is difficult to say what the fee shouldbe. For instance, some courses of immunisation require several administrationsover a period of time. We are therefore recommending a standard fee for items orcourses of service in pursuance of public policy, and leaving it to the health departments and the profession^ representatives to agree in the light of this on methods and levels of payment for particular services. In deciding what fee torecommend we have assumed that, if and when vaccinations and immunisationsin pursuance of public policy are remunerated by Executive Councils, theincrease in doctors&apos; earnings from Executive Councils will be to some extentoffset by a reduction of earnings from local authorities for the issue of records of vaccination and immunisation.208. We see no reason to retain the link between the temporary resident fee,which covers services actually provided for a temporary resident for a period of up to three months, and the annual capitation fee per patient on the doctor&apos;slist, payable whatever services are given during the year. We have decided torecommend that the temporary resident fee should remain at its present level.We consider that there should not be a higher fee for temporary residents aged65 and over than for those under 65: we recommend a standard rate for alltemporary residents.209. In recommending an increase in the amounts credited to the ruralpractice funds we have borne in mind that rural practitioners with smalllists will benefit from the relative redistribution of total remuneration which wehave already noted as one of the effects of the new system, though this will be tosome extent offset by the fact that rural practitioners with small lists are less likely than their urban colleagues to be able to qualify for a group practiceallowance and still less likely to qualify for an allowance for practice in designatedareas.210. We have been informed by the representatives of the profession that inEngland and Wales a payment of 5/- a year for every one hundred patients on a doctor&apos;s list is made to recompense him for the drugs and dressings which he
provides to patients from his surgery stock. They have proposed to the health departments that this system should be discontinued and replaced by theScottish system whereby drugs and dressings can be replaced by the issue of aprescription by the doctor, but the Health Departments have rejected thissuggestion. The profession^ representatives have invited us to endorse theirown proposal, or failing that to recommend that the payment should in future be 15/- a year for every one hundred patients on the list.211. This payment amounts at present to about  6 a year for a doctor withan average list; the profession^ alternative proposal would increase this toabout  18. Another way of putting it is that the present payment is equivalentto about Jd. on the capitation fee; the profession^ proposal would increasethat to just under 2d. We doubt whether it makes sense to have separate arrange-ments for reimbursing this relatively small expenditure, and we recommend thatit should in future be regarded as covered by the capitation fees, not only inEngland and Wales but also in Scotland. Our recommendations on capitationfees are formulated accordingly.212. Finally, before we set out our recommendations for the variouspayments under the new system, there are certain matters of a technical naturewith which we must deal. In arriving at the payments we propose, we have takeninto account practice expenses as well as net income; the new payments aregross remuneration. The latest available figure for practice expenses is the totalof practice expenses credited to the pool for 1963/64, as derived from sampleinquiries by the Inland Revenue. We have allowed for an increase in averagepractice expenses at a compound annual rate of A\ per cent, since that time; wehave also allowed for the effect of changes in the treatment of depreciationallowances by virtue of the Finance Act 1965. Our recommendations are intended to cover the annual average of practice expenses in 1966-67 and 1967-68estimated on this basis. We have assumed that  4 million a year will be re-imbursed direct in respect of expenditure on practice premises and that  3fmillion to  4 million a year will be directly reimbursed in connection withexpenses on ancillary help. We have allowed for the fact that the directreimbursement of expenditure on practice premises will provide for thereimbursement of a notional rent on owner-occupied premises. We are not clearthat notional rent on owner-occupied premises has hitherto been given full weight in decisions on remuneration. It seems likely that practice expensescredited to the pool have included little or nothing for notional rent, though they will have included some expenditure on maintenance and other items which might be the landlords responsibility in the case of rented premises andmay thus be taken to reflect one element in notional rent on owner-occupiedpremises. ,213. Hitherto certain expenses incurred in connection with work for hospital authorities, local authorities and Government departments and expenses incurred in connection with private practice have been included in thetotal practice expenses credited to the pool, the first because they were suffi-ciently unimportant to make it unnecessary to try to identify and exclude themand the second because of the difficulty of estimating their amount. We have nowbeen provided with more up-to-date estimates of earnings from and expenses on private practice than were available a year ago, and with an estimate of those
Recommendations on levels of payments215. We recommend the following levels of payment with effect from 1st April 1966 for the various items in the new system of remuneration as described in the Second Report of Joint Discussions between general practitionerrepresentatives and the Minister of Health (cf. para. 154 of this report):(1) Basic practice allowance: full rate ..      ..      1,000 0s.  Od. a year(2) Standard capitation fees:(a) for each patient aged under 65 ..      ..           1  0s.  Od. a year(b) for each patient aged 65 or over       ..          1   8s.  Od. a year(3) Payments for &quot; out-of-hours &quot; responsibilities -ties(i) Supplementary practice allowance:full rate        ..u......       200  0s.  Od. a year(ii) Supplementary capitation fee for eachpatient in excess of 1,000 on the list(1,000 per doctor on the combinedlists of doctors in partnership) ..      .. 2s.  6d. a year(iii) Fee for visit requested and made betweenmidnight and 7.00 a.m.....      ..  ,,       1   0s.  Od. a visit(4) Additions to the basic practice allowance (fullrates):(a) To a doctor whose main surgery is situated in an area that has been&quot; designated &quot; for a continuous period ofthree years up to the date of payment   ..       400  0s,  Od. a yearexpenses incurred in connection with work for hospital authorities, localauthorities and Government departments which have hitherto been included inthe total of practice expenses credited to the pool. The change of system pro-vides an opportune moment for taking these expenses out of remuneration forgeneral medical services. We have accordingly not provided in our recommenda-tions for the reimbursement of these expenses. In the past, however, in fixingaverage net income both the Royal Commission and we have made allowance for the fact that expenses not attributable to general medical services were beingcredited to the pool; it must be assumed that both they and we would have recommended higher levels of average net income if these expenses had not beencredited to the pool. We think that this point should be taken into account in considering our recommendations on levels of payments in the new system.214. Our recommendations are based on the assumption that doctors agedseventy and over who provide unrestricted services will receive payments under the new system on the same basis as other doctors providing unrestrictedservices, except where the Governments proposals in the Second Report of joint Discussions specifically provide otherwise (for instance, it is proposed thateligibility for seniority payments and for additional payments during sicknessshould cease at age 70).
(b) To a doctor practising with others in a central surgery in such a way as to satisfy the agreed definition of group practice ..       200  0s.   Od. a year(c) Seniority payments (subject after 1969 toattendance at a prescribed number ofsessions of post-graduate training):(i) To a doctor whose name has been continuously included in the MedicalRegister for fifteen years and who hasbeen a principal providing unrestricted-tricted general medical services underthe National Health Service for atleast the last five years       ..      ..       200  0s.

The Second Report of Joint Discussions indicates as the qualification for entitlement to the third seniority payment that a doctor shall have been continuously included in the Medical Register for thirty-five years and shallhave been a principal providing unrestricted general medical services underthe National Health Service for at least twenty-five years. As the national health Service was instituted on 5th July 1948, this could, if taken strictly, be read to mean that no doctor could qualify for the third seniority paymentbefore 5th July 1973. We do not believe that this interpretation can have been
intended. Accordingly we recommend that until 5th July 1973 a doctor shallbe eligible for the third seniority payment if he has been continuously includedon the Medical Register for the last thirty-five years and has been providingunrestricted general medical services under the National Health Servicecontinuously since 5th July 1948.217. We make no recommendations on the following matters, which are left for direct negotiation between the Health Departments and the representa-tives of the profession:Additional payments during sicknessInitial practice allowanceSupplementary annual paymentsPayments under the trainee schemeFees for administering anaestheticsFees for emergency treatmentPayments in respect of the dispensing and supply of drugs and appliances.218. We recommend that the Health Departments and the representativesof the profession should negotiate direct on the application of the new systemof remuneration and of our recommendations to doctors providing restrictedservices, and should consider whether as a result of the introduction of the new system of remuneration any further provision needs to be made in respect ofpractitioners who employ assistants.
CHAPTER VIIREMUNERATION OF GENERAL DENTAL PRACTITIONERS219. The present system of remuneration of general dental practitionersstems from the recommendations of the Royal Commission. Dentists are paidby an item of service method of payment. A target average net income fromthe general dental services for all principals, full-time and part-time together,working wholly or partly in those services, is recommended by the Review Body.The Dental Rates Study Group, which comprises representatives of the pro-fession and the Health Departments with an independent Chairman, is chargedwith the duty of determining gross fees for each item of service in such a fashionthat the target net income for the average dentist is achieved in the standardnumber of hours at work. For this purpose the Study Group keeps underreview average times for each dental operation and the average number of hours worked per annum.220. Following the report of the Royal Commission, and in fulfilment oftheir recommendation, the target average net income from the general dentalservices for all principals, full-time and part-time together, working wholly or partly in those services, was fixed at  2,400 a year. A scale of fees (which represented a reduction in gross remuneration) to produce this target came intoeffect in June 1962. In our First Report in 1963 we recommended that the target average net income should be increased by 14 per cent, to  2,740 for theperiod from 1963 to 1966. By the time the Study Group came to fix a new scale of fees the 1962 scale was producing average net income at a rate about 10 percent, above the  2,400 target. Allowing for their expectation of a continuingrise in output, the Study Group fixed a scale of fees for the new target which came into effect in October 1963.221. In the following year there was every sign that the continued rise in output was carrying average net income once again well above the target. TheBritish Dental Association proposed a system of &quot; tolerances &quot; which wouldhave permitted average net income to rise appreciably above the target as aresult of rising output without fees then having to be reduced. While we were considering this proposal it became known that an inquiry by the Dental RatesStudy Group showed that the average number of hours worked in 1963 had risen by about 4 per cent, from the figure on which the Royal Commission^recommendations and our 1963 recommendations were based. It had been recognised by the Royal Commission that a substantial change in the number of hours worked would be a ground for revising target net income. On the basis ofthe estimates of future average gross earnings and practice expenses whichwere before us, we concluded that the 1963 scale of fees, if allowed to stand until1966, would over the period as a whole produce about the right average net income, taking into account the increase in the average number of hours worked.In our Second Report,27 therefore, we recommended that the level of net income27 Submitted on 10th December 1964 and published in the Official Report, House of Commonsfor 1st February 1965.
until our next general review should be that which would result from leaving the current scale of fees in operation unchanged. This recommendation was accepted.222. In the summer of 1965 it became clear that average gross earnings wererising less fast than had been estimated and that the scale of fees was producing a considerably lower average net income than the Review Body had envisaged.In our Sixth Report,28 therefore, we decided to recommend a target net income of  2,950 to come into effect as soon as possible, making it clear that this was designed to produce for the rest of the review period the result intended by our Second Report, taking account of a change in practice structure whichhad been reported to us and to which we refer again later in this chapter (para-graphs 228 and 229). This recommendation necessitated a new fee scale, whichwas introduced in September 1965. This scale still failed to yield the target net income which we had recommended, and another new scale, increasing certainfees, was introduced in February 1966.Manpower and workload223. Before considering certain problems that have arisen in the system of remuneration of general dental practitioners we discuss some of the general considerations that we have had in mind in thinking about the level of their remuneration. We do not go over the ground of economic factors and com-parable incomes; the arguments put forward by the British Dental association on these matters were similar to those advanced on behalf of hospital medical and dental staff and general medical practitioners, which we have discussed in chapter III. The manpower and workload situation in dentistry, however,requires separate treatment.224. The number of dentists on the Dentists&apos; Register rose from 15,693 to16,841 between 1954 and 1964, the latest year for which figures are at present available. The increase of 1,148 included 679 dentists holding commonwealth and foreign qualifications. Since 1961, however, the number of dentists onthe register holding Commonwealth and foreign qualifications has changedvery little, and the main increase has been in the number of dentists holdingBritish qualifications. This pattern has not been matched in the general dentalservice. The number of dentists in the general dental service in Great Britain,having risen from 1961 to 1962, fell back by 1964 to the 1961 level of just under11,600. This slight fall since 1962 is, however, attributable entirely to the retirement of older dentists, which had been expected. Between 1961 and 1964the number aged under 30 increased by 444. There is thus no evidence of a deterioration in the ability of the general dental service to attract and holdyounger dentists. There is no evidence to suggest that the general dental service is losing a significant number of dentists by emigration.225. The intake of students into the first professional year in dental schoolshas risen steadily from 589 in 1961-62 to 688 in 1964-65. Though the intakein 1964-65 was the highest up to that time, about thirty places remained unfilled.Preliminary indications for 1965-66 are that 760 places were available for28 Submitted on 13th July 1965 and published in the Official Report, House of Commons,for 5th August 1965.
admissions into the first professional year, of which about 740 were filled, theunfilled places being mainly in one new school.226. None of this evidence suggests that recruitment and wastage rates inthe general dental service give cause for immediate concern. These matters will,however, need to be carefully watched. By 1970 the number of places availablefor admissions to the first professional year in dental schools will have risen to880, and the number will rise still further by 1974. The dental schools are tosome extent in competition for candidates with medical schools. Unlike medical schools, however, dental schools have no surplus of suitable candidates;indeed medicine is often the first choice of those who subsequently take updentistry. If the number of places available in medical schools is to be increased,more of those who have medicine as their first choice will be able to satisfythat choice, and it may become more difficult to fill places in dental schools.227. The indicator which has been much relied upon as a measure of output of general practitioners in the general dental service is the figure of average gross earnings corrected for revisions of the fee scale. Up to 1964 the trend of these figures implied that output was rising steadily. There were several reasons for this, apart from changes in the number of hours worked.First, the introduction of new types of equipment, and particularly the air rotordrill, enabled the dentist to perform some operations much faster than in thepast. Second, it seems clear that there has been a change in the organisation ofpractices, including a considerable increase over the years in the use made ofancillary help. These developments have enabled the dentist to give moretreatment in a given amount of time, but it seems likely that they must by now have largely achieved their effect. A third factor in the increase in average gross earnings, and therefore in the implied increase in output, has been the changein the age structure of the profession. The peak of earning power comes rela-tively early in the career in dentistry, and when the proportion of youngerdentists rises, as it has done in recent years, and the demand for dental care is increasing, the average output of the profession goes up. The change in theage distribution of the profession is continuing, and average output may beexpected to rise on that account for some time to come.228. Since 1964, however, the figures of average gross earnings have alsobeen affected by a major change in practice structure. There has been a signifi-cant fall in the ratio of assistants to principals, and the evidence suggests thata considerable number of assistants have recently become principals in theirown right, often being taken into partnership or association by their formeremployers. This change does no.t necessarily affect the output of the professionas a whole, but it does reduce the average earnings per principal. It takes sometime for the effect to be fully reflected in the estimates of average gross earnings,but when it is known that there has recently been such a change it is impossiblefor some time thereafter to rely on successive quarterly estimates of averagegross earnings as indicators of trends of output.229. The rate of increase in average gross earnings began to fall off in1964, and the average gross earnings for the years ended 31st March, 30th june and 30th September 1965 actually declined. The representatives of the health departments indicated that the change in practice structure could well accountdirectly or indirectly for the greater part of the change in the trend since early
1964, and that the figures of average gross earnings could in fact be consistent with a continuing rise in average output, though perhaps at a somewhat lower rate than in earlier years.230. We have found it impossible to draw any reliable conclusions fromthese figures. We have not treated them as evidence of a decline in output;indeed to do so would be inconsistent with the evidence that the numbers of courses of treatment continue to rise. There is no evidence to suggest thataverage hours worked have changed significantly since the Dental Rates study group survey of hours worked in 1963, the results of which we allowed for inthe recommendations in our Second Report.231. We have thus found no immediate problem of manpower and noconclusive evidence about changes in workload, of the kind or extent that wenoted in Chapter IV in relation to parts of the medical profession, which would lead us to take the view on those grounds that earnings from the general dentalservice were seriously inadequate. We have, however, thought it right to have some regard to the possible effect on recruitment of dentists of the prospective increase in the number of places in medical schools.System of remuneration232. In 1962, at the time of our first review, the British Dental Associationdrew our attention to the difficulty of operating the system of remunerationrecommended by the Royal Commission in a time of steadily increasing output.If target average net income is fixed at a single rate for a period of three yearsand at the beginning of that period the scale of fees is so framed as to yield the target average net income at that time, then, if the level of output subsequentlyrises, it is likely that before the end of the period fees will have to be reduced if practitioners are not to receive an average net income of more than the target. If the rise in output is attributable to a large extent to an increasing proportion of younger dentists, this is liable to bear particularly hardly onolder dentists. The increased output comes from the younger dentists who thusincrease their earnings; if the target average net income is then reduced, theyare probably left with earnings at the same level or even at a higher level thanat the beginning of the period, but the older dentist, who is less able to under-take additional work, may well find his earnings reduced, even though hisoutput remains steady. We felt, however, that the proposals put to us by theBritish Dental Association in 1964 for altering the system would create moredifficulties than they would solve, and since we submitted our First Report wehave been considering whether we could suggest any change in the system whichwould meet these problems in another way.233. In our most recent evidence we have become aware of further problems in the current system of remuneration. We received an impression that the dental Rates Study Group had encountered difficulties which were preventingit from properly fulfilling the functions intended for it by the Royal Commission.Fixing times for dental operations or ascertaining the total number of hours worked did not seem to have raised any special problems; it seemed that difficulties had arisen mainly in the course of trying to agree, when fixing a new scale of fees, upon what allowance should be made for the growth of practiceexpenses and for changes in average gross earnings attributable to changes in\)
output or changes in practice structure during the period which was expected tobe covered by the scale. It was clear to us that the Study Group was encounteringthe same sort of trouble in allowing for changes in output when fixing fees aswe have encountered in trying to assess the extent to which the trend of outputshould be taken into account in fixing target net income.234. The British Dental Association also considered that the work of the study Group was showing an increasing tendency to suffer delays because therepresentatives of the Health Departments lacked authority to make decisions and had frequently to refer back for instructions. The Health Departmentsindicated that on a number of occasions this had been attributable to pointshaving been raised at short notice.235. We do not suggest any major change in the system of remuneration.We have thought about possible alternative systems, but we have concluded that payment by item of service is the only feasible method of payment inpresent circumstances. The Health Departments have (so they told us) come tothe same conclusion; and we have noted that a recent survey by the BritishDental Association shows that the majority of general dental practitionerswould prefer to continue to be remunerated in this way. As a means of deter-mining the amount of fees, we see no alternative to calculating on the basisof a target net income and estimated practice expenses. Neither the health departments nor the British Dental Association dissented from this conclusion.We understand, however, that they are embarking upon discussions on thesystem of remuneration as a result of which they may wish to suggest some changes, for instance the incorporation into the system of some form of senioritypayment, which the Association^ survey has shown would commend itself tomany dentists. We have been told that we shall be kept in touch with thecourse of these discussions, and that we shall be consulted about any major change in the system or in the distribution of remuneration.236. The representatives of the British Dental Association drew our attentionto that section of our Fifth Report which dealt with return on capital invested in practices by general medical practitioners, in which we had stated that, whileit seemed clear that the Royal Commission had made some allowance in determining average net income for the need to find capital, we thought thatthey had not included any specific amount for interest on capital employed.We noted that figures of practice expenses derived from sample inquiries intotax returns would not take such interest fully into account, and we recom-mended that the Government and the profession should examine this problemfurther and, if the present arrangements did not make sufficient allowance for interest on capital employed in practices, should endeavour to agree uponchanges that would achieve that result in future. The representatives of theBritish Dental Association invited us to state whether we were equally anxious that in the assessment by the Dental Rates Study Group of the practice expensesof general dental practitioners there should also be proper allowance for capital investment.237. There may well be a number of differences between doctors and dentists in this matter, in that a larger proportion of capital invested in thepractice by a dentist is represented, by equipment which qualifies for depre-ciation allowances and should therefore be reflected in practice expenses. We
think that the Royal Commission^ recommendations (and therefore our recommendations subsequently) on net income must be deemed to have takenaccount of the necessity to provide the capital needed to maintain the day-to-dayrunning of the practice and to meet such expenses as continue to be incurredwhen the dentist himself is on holiday, or is away from the practice for study or because of sickness. We think, however, that it is desirable in principle that grossremuneration, of dentists as well as doctors, should make sufficient allowance for interest on capital invested in premises and equipment, and we hope that in their discussions on the system of remuneration the Health Departments and therepresentatives of the British Dental Association will consider whether thepresent arrangements make sufficient allowance for interest on capital soinvested, and will if necessary discuss the possibility of changes to achieve thatresult.238. Though we are not suggesting any major change in the system of remuneration, we are recommending the introduction of certain relativelyminor modifications which will, we hope, go some way to meeting the problems that we have described. We have considered what target average net incomewe should recommend for a period of two years beginning on 1st April 1966;we have, however, decided to express this target not as a single figure but astwo annual rates of target average net income so graduated as to permit arise of about 4 per cent, per year in average gross earnings without calling for areduction of fees during the period. We recommend that the Dental RatesStudy Group should be invited to proceed immediately to fix a scale of feesso as to yield average net income for the year beginning 1st April 1966 in line with our recommendation for the first year of the period. We further recom-mend that in the early months of 1967 the Study Group should be asked to review the scale of fees in the light of the latest available information and to propose whatever changes may be necessary so as to yield average net income for the year beginning 1st April 1967 at the second of the rates we are recom-mending. We also recommend that there should be no change in the fee scalebetween the annual reviews by the Study Group, except for the purpose of altering relativities within the scale.239. The effect of these changes will be that the scale of fees will be reviewed by the Dental Rates Study Group once a year. If average gross earnings riseor fall during the course of a year, there may be some measure of overpaymentor underpayment of dentists, particularly during the latter part of the year; butwe recommend that no attempt should be made either at the time or subse-quently to offset the error in that year. Towards the end of the year the scale of fees will be adjusted for the coming year so as to provide for the higher targetnet income for that year and for whatever changes have affected or are expectedto affect average gross earnings and practice expenses. There should be no needfor reductions in the fee scale unless during the year average gross earnings have risen by well over 4 per cent, for some reason other than longer hours of work (a development which might call for a revision of target net income) or there hasbeen some pronounced reduction in the rate of growth of practice expenses. &apos;240. It is for us to take a view on the extent to which changes in the levelof output should be taken into account in the determination of target average net income. This we have done. It will be for the Dental Rates Study group to decide to what extent to base its calculations of the fee scale on forecasts of
future movements of average gross earnings attributable to changes in output,changes in age and practice structure and changes in the relativities within the fee scale which may affect the pattern of treatment. In view of the difficulty ofmaking these forecasts in present circumstances and of interpreting the statisticalevidence, we think that the Study Group may want to consider basing itscalculations on estimates of the annual rate of average gross earnings for themost recent period, taking account, however, of the estimated growth of practiceexpenses.241. A further point that has been drawn to our attention is that, when achange in target net income is recommended to come into effect from the dateof promulgation of a new scale of fees, delay in the process of agreeing a new scale can unduly postpone the implementation of the new level of target net income. Experience following our First Report illustrates that difficulty. our report, submitted at the end of February 1963, recommended that the feescale should be adjusted to the revised target net income with effect from such time as the Study Group agreed upon the adjusted scale, not being earlier than April 1963. Our report was accepted and published at the end of March,but it was not until the middle of October that the Dental Rates Study group had been able to complete its work and regulations for a new scale of feeshad been made.242. It cannot be satisfactory that a change in target net income whichhas been recommended and accepted should be delayed for so many monthsbecause of the complication of the processes of translating it into a scale of fees and giving the new scale legal effect. The representatives of the BritishDental Association accepted that there would be considerable administrative difficulties in applying a new scale of fees retrospectively to courses of treatmentbegun before the scale was introduced; but they suggested that it might bepossible to find some way of giving interim effect to a recommendation ontarget net income, possibly by increasing all fees by a flat percentage amount,before the introduction of a definitive new fee scale, so as to reduce the period before a recommendation on target net income took effect.243. Under the law as it stands regulations altering the scale of fees cannotbe retrospective; they can operate only from a date after they have been laid.Whether the change takes the form of a new scale of fees or a percentageaddition to existing fees, the new fees have to be agreed by the Study group and incorporated in regulations. It appears that this makes it impossible forus to recommend a definite date for the implementation of a new rate of targetnet income. Moreover, if there should have to be a cut in fees, or if the description of the items of treatment to which a fee relates is changed, it is legally necessaryfor new rates to apply only to courses begun on or after the operative date ofthe regulations. One possible way of reducing the time which it takes for anincrease in target net income to come into effect might be to apply a percentage increase to estimates for courses begun before the operative date in respect ofwhich payment had not yet been made. There would be considerable admini-strative difficulties about any arrangement which meant that the Dental Esti-mates Board had to reprocess estimates which had already been dealt with;but the Health Departments are considering with the Dental Estimates Boardwhether it would be practicable to introduce simultaneously a revised scale of
fees for courses of treatment begun on or after the operative date and an equivalent percentage addition to apply to estimates for courses begun beforethe operative date and received (or authorised or scheduled) by the DentalEstimates Board after that date.244. The &apos; most substantial contribution to reducing the delay would,however, come from a reduction of the time taken by the Dental Rates study group to decide upon a new scale of fees. We do not underestimate thedifficulties. The technical processes which have to be completed are complicated,and they involve forecasts which may be controversial. We recommend thatthe Health Departments and the British Dental Association should examinetheir procedures and arrangements so as to enable the Group to function and complete its work without delay, as the Royal Commission intended. Werecommend that the Health Departments should consider whether a greater measure of authority can be given to their representatives so as to reduce theneed for reference back for instructions.245. The arrangements which the Health Departments are examining, forcoupling the introduction of a new scale of fees for courses of treatment begunon or after an operative date with a percentage addition on estimates receivedby the Dental Estimates Board before that date but still being dealt with, would help to make an increase in target net income fully effective more quickly than has been possible in the past. We hope that arrangements on these lines willbe practicable. We attach importance to having recommendations on targetnet income implemented and brought into full effect as soon as possible afterthe beginning of the period to which they relate, and we regret that the combina-tion of legal and administrative difficulties makes it impossible for us to recom-mend a definite date on which a new rate of target net income should comeinto effect.Recommendations on target average net income246. We recommend that the target average net income from the general dental service for all principals, full-time and part-time together, workingwholly or partly in that service, should be  3,200 in the year beginning 1st April1966 and  3,325 in the year beginning 1st April 1967. We recommend thatthese rates should come into operation on or as soon as possible after 1st April1966 and 1967 respectively.Health centre dentists247. The representatives of the British Dental Association invited us torecommend an increase in the salary scales for health centre dentists, who arein effect salaried general dental practitioners working in health centres ratherthan in their own premises. As we noted in our First Report, the rates of pay of health,centre dentists were revised in 1962 to bring them into line with the pay of local authority dentists, who were in many cases working alongside themand doing similar work. We thought that it would be inappropriate to disturbthis relationship so soon after it had been agreed. We therefore recommendedthat for the time being salary scales for health centre dentists should remainbroadly in line with those for local authority dentists, subject to further con-sideration at a later review. Since that time health centre dentists have received
further increases from 1st April 1964 and 1st January 1966 in line with increases in the salary scales of local authority dentists. We were informed by the health departments that a further pay claim had recently been submitted for localauthority dentists.248. The representatives of the British Dental Association thought that the link with local authority dentists had grown up as a matter of expediency, andhad little or no basis of principle: they argued that, though it was true thathealth centre dentists often worked in the same premises as local authoritydentists, the work done by health centre dentists approximated more in character to that of general dental practitioners.249. We recommend that for the time being the salary scales of health centre dentists should continue to remain broadly in line with those of localauthority dentists. We may, however, wish to review their salary scales further,if and when we are asked to consider salary scales for general medical practi-practitioners practising in and from health centres.
CHAPTER VIIISUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS250. In this chapter we seek to draw together the main threads which runthrough our report and to summarise our general conclusions. Our recommenda-tions are summarised in three appendices.251. We have explained in Chapter II why we think it right on this occasion to relate our recommendations to a period of two years from 1st April 1966,instead of the three years envisaged by the Royal Commission. Our recom-mendations must be viewed in the light of our intention that they should stand for two years and not three years. We think it important to stress this, because there has been widespread expectation that our recommendations at this review would, like our 1963 recommendations, be for a period of three years.The professions&apos; proposals for hospital medical and dental staff and for general dental practitioners were based on this expectation, though the representativesof the professions later welcomed the suggestion that on this occasion our recommendations should be for a period of two years.252. We have also explained in Chapter II that we have taken account ofgeneral economic developments in the period since 1963, and have allowed fordevelopments that may be expected to occur in the next two years. In particularwe have taken account of the general rise in money incomes between 1963 and1965 and its implications for our 1963 recommendations. Though the fact that other incomes have risen at a particular average rate is not by itself a conclusivereason why doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; incomes should rise at that rate, the growth of other incomes is evidence which has to be taken into account. We believethat doctors and dentists in the National Health Service should not be penalisedfor the fact that developments of this kind have not been taken into account in considering their remuneration since early in 1963.253. In the evidence put to us by the professions the cases for the increases of remuneration proposed were all based mainly on comparisons with otherincomes, on the manpower position and needs, and on workload. We have explained in Chapter III why, though we have carefully considered the evidence available to us on comparisons, we have not felt able to rely on it as a decisiveor even as a primary factor in forming our views. We have examined in ChaptersIV and VII the evidence on manpower and workload, and we have assessed itsrelevance to remuneration. Our aim throughout has been to try to decide whatlevels of remuneration are appropriate for all the circumstances of the period  to which our review relates.254. This has led us to reconsider fundamentally, critically and in detail the structure and levels of remuneration in each of the branches of the national health Service with which we are concerned, and to make recommendations which alter, in some cases radically, both the structures and the relative levels.
We believe that the new structures and levels of remuneration which we recom-mend for hospital doctors and dentists, for general medical practitioners and forgeneral dental practitioners represent fair rewards for their responsibilities and duties and are reasonable in relation both to each other and to incomes of people with comparable qualifications, responsibilities and standing in otherwalks of life, for the period which this review is intended to cover.255. We have broken with the past in two important respects. First, wehave come to the conclusion that it is no longer either consistent with realitiesand with current thinking and practice in professional remuneration, or fair to those concerned, to pay the most junior grades of hospital doctor at rates which are manifestly not only out of line with rates paid to people of similarage and comparable qualifications in other professions but also out of proportion to the amount of work they are expected to do. This could be justified only ifthey could be regarded in some sort as apprentices; but this does not seem tous to be the right way of thinking about the matter. Clearly they still have much to learn of the practice of medicine, which they can learn only by practical experience; clearly also one cannot consider starting salaries without regard tocareer prospects. But house officers and senior house officers are qualifieddoctors and their work is essential to the hospital service. We are satisfied thatthe level of their remuneration, and that of the grades directly above them,needs to be substantially raised, not only in fairness to them but also in theinterests of the hospital service and the practice of medicine, and so in thenational interest.256. Second, we believe that general medical practice has come to a criticalmoment. We have in mind not so much the possibility of mass resignation fromthe National Health Service (though that would be a lamentable occurrence)as the future of general practice in this country, however provided. The lossof doctors to general practice (those who have not come in as well as those whohave gone out) may seem to have been relatively small so far; but it has takenplace against the background of a rising population, and the average rate ofwithdrawals has been rising. If this trend is not reversed, it will not be long before the load will become too great for general practice as we have known it,particularly in some parts of the country. If it became impossible to maintaingeneral practice, the loss to the nation would be very great; the standards of medical care for the population as a whole would suffer, and it would bedifficult and very expensive to rehabilitate general practice or to provideother forms of first-line medical care.257. Professional and lay opinion alike recognise that in this countrygeneral practice should continue to be the first line of medical care. The rapidextension of medical science and development of new techniques have alteredand will continue to alter the demands upon general practice, and will necessitatechanges in organisation which are only beginning to be developed and put intooperation. It is going to be increasingly important for the doctor&apos;s time andenergies to be concentrated on the tasks that need his clinical skill and judg-ment. Among other things this means, we believe, more group practice, andmore use of ancillary help not just for non-medical duties but for carrying outcare and treatment under the doctor&apos;s supervision and responsibility. Withthese developments general practice can continue to be, or where it has ceased
to be can once again become, a rewarding way of life in which the practice ofgood medicine is combined with a direct, personal and continuing relationship of care for and service to those who need medical help and advice.258. This will not happen unless the whole profession want it to happen;and it will not happen without great changes of organisation and attitude which it is the responsibility primarily of the profession to accept and bringabout. There can be no doubt that the next two years are the testing time forthe future of general practice. No fundamental or lasting changes will beachieved without an immediate increase in the level of remuneration, though of itself this will not suffice. The new system of remuneration should do much topromote good practice and encourage practitioners. There will be direct financialincentives to group practice. The schemes for direct reimbursement of expendi-ture on practice premises and ancillary help will be a stimulus to changes thatwill improve both service to the patient and the life of the doctor. The additional payments for extra qualifications, special experience and service to general practice will reward good doctoring and encourage doctors to equip themselvesto practise good medicine. Seniority payments will provide the prospects of higher remuneration in the later years of a career without the need to add tothe burden of work in terms of numbers of patients. Above all, perhaps, the doctor will be able to feel that, if his own remuneration goes up as a result ofhis own efforts or deserts, it is not at the cost of his fellow-doctors: there willbe no pool.259. The need to review levels of general practitioners&apos; remuneration interms of the new system and in the light of the arguments put before us inevidence has given us the opportunity and the material for a thorough assess-ment (or re-assessment) of all the relevant factors and considerations. We have discussed these matters in more detail in Chapter VI. Because the method of remuneration is to be so greatly changed, it would be misleading for us to try to sum up our recommendations in terms of a single figure or rate of increase:some doctors will get larger increases, some smaller, according to size andeven type of list, age, qualifications, area of practice, cost of maintainingpremises, amount of ancillary help and so on. The system will provide incentivesand rewards for good medicine and high standards of service, and possibilitiesof increasing remuneration otherwise than by taking on more patients. On theother hand there may be some doctors who will prefer (if circumstances permit)to contract out of night and weekend responsibility even at the cost of some loss of earnings. Taken as a whole, however, our recommendations will sub-stantially increase the earnings of general practitioners, and so the cost ofgeneral practice to the Exchequer.260. We consider this increase to be justified, indeed required, by theimmediate need to stem the loss from and encourage recruitment to general practice, by the nature and growth of the responsibilities and burdens of workwhich fall upon general practitioners, and by the need to promote changes in organisation and attitudes that will help to foster pride and confidence in general practice. In making our recommendations we have had very much inmind not just the interests of the doctors or the statutory responsibilities placedon government to provide a National Health Service, but the whole future of medical care through general practice in this country. We believe that an
increase in remuneration of the order we have recommended is one, but onlyone, of the necessary conditions precedent for the future of general practice.The other conditions are for the Government and the profession, not for us;but we want to emphasise that we see our recommendations as one amongseveral lines of attack on a wider problem. We hope that they will help tofacilitate other changes. They will be frustrated in much of their purpose if those other changes are not brought about.261. For a variety of reasons it is impossible to estimate the cost of our proposals exactly. The latest available figures of numbers in the hospital services by grades, which relate to 30th September 1964, do not indicate thedistribution of staff in each grade at the various points in the salary scale, andit is difficult to arrive at a precise estimate of the cost of the increases recom-mended, particularly for the junior hospital doctors, for whom the salary structure is to be considerably changed. Estimates of the cost of our recom-mendations for general medical practitioners are also somewhat tentative, since it is impossible to forecast how many doctors will qualify for some of thepayments under the new system of remuneration, or how much will be paid outin direct reimbursements of expenditure on practice premises and on ancillaryhelp. The published Estimates of expenditure on health service votes in 1965-66showed the total cost of salaries of hospital medical and dental staff and of grossremuneration by executive councils of general medical and dental practitionersand of ophthalmic medical practitioners at about  245 million, and the totalgross cost of the hospital services and executive councils&apos; services at just over 1,060 million. For 1966-67 the total cost of these services is estimated at about 1,175 million on the basis of the present rates of remuneration and the existing system of remuneration for general medical practitioners. We estimate that our recommendations, together with consequential increases in employers&apos; super-annuation contributions, would add somewhere in the region of  36 million to 39 million to this figure. We recognise that this is a large amount of money;but we are unanimous that it has to be found if the aims of the National health service are to be secured and doctors and dentists are to be reasonablyremunerated for their work in the service.262. We believe that our recommendations in this report are consistent with the general principles set out in the White Paper on Prices and incomes policy.29 We have been mindful both of the views expressed by the RoyalCommission in paragraph 404 of their Report30 and of the comment made bythe National Board for Prices and Incomes in their report on recommendations by the Standing Advisory Committee on the Pay of the Higher Civil Service:The White Paper [on Prices and Incomes Policy] is not concerned only witha period of particular economic difficulty. It is concerned with the long-term problems of orderly economic growth, and sets out guidance to achieve this end. The White Paper should be interpreted in the light of its long-termaims.31As we understand them, the principles of the White Paper, while aimed at thegeneral objective of relating the average rate of increase in money incomes to29 Cmnd. 2639, published in April 1965.30 Cmnd. 939, paragraph 404; quoted in paragraph 26 above.31 Cmnd. 2882, published in January 1966, paragraph 16.
the long-term rate of growth of national productivity, do not preclude pay increases that can be demonstrably justified by considerations of economicefficiency, urgent social need or manifest equity.This review has placed exceptional burdens on the shoulders of the secretaries to the Review Body, Mr. R. T. Armstrong and Mr. T. W. Hall.The delay in the submission of evidence shortened the time at our disposal ifwe were to complete our task before 1st April 1966. It was due to the tirelessefforts and unstinted help of the Secretaries that we were able to do this. we wish formally to express our thanks to them for the excellence of their work onour behalf.KINDERSLEY, ChairmanARTHUR BAGNALLS.

APPENDIX I summary OF RECOMMENDATIONSHospital medical and dental staff(1) The salary scales we recommend for clinical staff in the hospital service are set out, with the present scales, in Appendix II. All the new scales areannual incremental scales. Detailed arrangements for assimilation to new scales are set out in paragraphs 102 to 106 in Chapter V.(2) No doctor who is not fully registered should proceed beyond the second point in the house officers&apos; salary scale (paragraph 91).(3) The starting salary of senior house officers on appointment to the gradeshould be the minimum of the scale irrespective of age (paragraph 92).(4) The existing provisions in the Terms and Conditions of Service of hospital Medical and Dental Staff governing starting pay on promotionshould apply to all promotions in the junior grades of hospital staff inthe new salary structure (paragraph 95).(5) Where a hospital doctor or dentist accepts an appointment in a lower grade for approved training purposes, so long as he remains in thelower grade he should continue to receive the salary which he was receiving at the time when he left his last appointment in the highergrade, and he should continue to earn incremental credit in the highergrade, so that when he reverts to an appointment in the higher grade here-enters the salary scale at the point which he would have reached ifhe had never left it (paragraph 97).(6) The minimum of the consultant scale should no longer be linked toage 34. All consultants should proceed up to the maximum of the scaleby annual increments, at whatever age they are appointed (paragraph100).(7) The allowance for a senior hospital medical or dental officer occupyinga post graded as a consultant post should be increased to  700 a year(paragraph 105).(8) Rates of payment of part-time hospital doctors and dentists should beincreased with effect from 1st April 1966 pro rata with the increase inthe salary scales of whole-time doctors and dentists in correspondinggrades (paragraph 107).(9) There should continue to be no weighting for part-time consultantsbeyond that recommended by the Royal Commission (paragraph 109).(10) Allocation of distinction awards to consultants should continue to bebased on prescribed numbers of awards rather than on percentages ofthose eligible. The numbers of distinction awards to be made availableshould be reviewed annually (paragraphs 114 and 117).
(11) The numbers and values of distinction awards should be increased from 1st April 1966 to the following (paragraph 116):100 A plus awards of  4,885315 A awards of  3,700950 B awards of  2,1751,900 C awards of  925.(12) The &quot; peripheral &quot; allowance should be raised to  140 (paragraph 118).(13) The fee for a domiciliary consultation should be increased to  5 10s. Od.and the additional fees pro rata, and the permitted annual maximum of earnings under section S(f) of the Terms and Conditions of service should be  275 in any quarter or  1,100 in any year (paragraph 119).(14) There should be no change in the arrangement whereby whole-timeconsultants and senior hospital medical officers who undertake domici-liary consultations should receive no fees for the first eight such consulta-tions each quarter (paragraph 119).(15) Fees for lectures to nurses should be increased to the following levels(paragraph 123):Consultants  3 10s. Od.Senior hospital medical officers  2 15s. Od.Senior registrars and medical assistants(at all salary levels)  2 10s. Od.Other grades  2 0s. Od.(16) The fee for exceptional consultations by consultants should be raised to  10 0s. Od. (paragraph 124).(17) The fee for exceptional consultations by general practitioners shouldbe increased to  3 5s. Od. (paragraph 126).(18) The special allowance for medical superintendents of psychiatric hospitals should be increased to  310 (paragraph 127).(19) Weekly and sessional rates for locum appointments in the hospital service should be as follows (paragraph 128):Consultant appointment  77 15s. Od. a week or  7 Is. 6d.a notional half-daySenior hospital medical (or  56 10s. Od. a week or  5 2s. 6d.dental) officer appointment a notional half-dayMedical assistant appointment       49 Is.

Od. a notional half-day., (20) Payments to general practitioners under Section 10 of Terms andConditions of Service of Hospital Medical and Dental Staff should beas follows (paragraph 125):(a) Payment to staff funds for general practitioner hospital units:  40per bed.(b) Payments to part-time medical officers at convalescent homes etc.: 275 a year for each weekly &quot; half-day &quot;, up to a maximum of 2,475 a year; 75 a year for one hour or less per week; 150 a year for over one hour but not more than two hours a week.(c) Payments for occasional work in the blood transfusion service: 1 13s. 4d. per hour or part of an hour, with a maximum of  5per session.(d) Payments for part-time general dental practitioner appointments: 275 a year for each weekly &quot; half-day &quot;, up to a maximum of 2,475 a year; 75 a year for one hour or less per week; 150 a year for over one hour but not more than two hours a week.(21) The Health Departments and the representatives of the profession should negotiate a system of board and lodging charges based on the followingworking principles (paragraph 138):(a) There should be no charge for lodging to a doctor for whomresidence in hospital is a condition of his appointment.(b) For other doctors who live in hospital the lodging charge shouldbe determined at an economic rate, having regard to the standardof accommodation provided.(c) All doctors, whether they are compulsorily or voluntarily residentand whether they are on duty or off duty, should pay for mealsthey take in hospital.Administrative medical staff(22) The salary scales for senior administrative medical officers in the largestregions should be  4,680 rising by two annual increments of  185 and four further annual increments of  190 to a maximum of  5,810. the salary scales for other administrative medical staff should be revised byagreement between the Health Departments and the profession^ repre-sentatives so as broadly to maintain existing relativities (paragraph 142).
Ophthalmic medical practitioners(23) The ophthalmic medical practitioners fee should be 20s. plus a further sum in respect of expenses to be agreed between the Health departments and the profession^ representatives (paragraph 146).General medical practitioners(24) The levels we recommend for the main payments under the new system of remuneration are set out in Appendix III (see also paragraph 215).(25) Arrangements for scaling down the basic and supplementary practiceallowances and the additional allowances for general practitioners who do not qualify for payment of the allowances at full rate should bediscussed between the Health Departments and the representatives ofthe profession in the light of the views we have expressed (paragraphs191 to 193).(26) The proposed pre-entry vocational training allowance for general practitioners should be an annual allowance only. Doctors who acquiredthe necessary qualifications and entered general practice before 1st April1966 should be entitled to receive this allowance from that date if they also meet the qualifications of list size and periods of duty in general medical service (paragraph 201).(27) It would in our view be preferable (though we do not make this a formalrecommendation) that eligibility for payments to general practitionersfor special experience and service to general practice should not be formally limited by age (paragraph 203).(28) Until 5th July 1973 a general practitioner should be eligible for the thirdseniority payment if he has been continuously included on the MedicalRegister for the last thirty-five years and has been providing unrestrictedgeneral medical services under the National Health Service continuouslysince 5th July 1948 (paragraph 216).(29) A general practitioner who is in receipt of a post-graduate educationallowance at the time when he first becomes entitled to a senioritypayment should Continue to receive that allowance for whatever remains of the five-year period for which it runs, but no doctor should startreceiving a post-graduate education allowance, or start on a new five-year period if he has already been in receipt of an allowance, after hehas become entitled to a seniority payment (paragraph 204).(30) The amount of the additional allowance for practice in &quot; designated &quot;areas should not vary with the character of the area. The criterion of. qualification for this allowance should be kept under review (paragraph206).(31) We recommend a standard fee for items or courses of service in pur-suance of public policy, and leave it to the Health Departments and the profession^ representatives to agree in the light of this on methods andlevels of payment for particular services (paragraph 207).
(32) The temporary resident fees should be at standard rates for all temporaryresidents, irrespective of age (paragraph 208).(33) Reimbursement for drugs and dressings provided to patients from a doctor&apos;s surgery stock should in future be regarded as covered by thecapitation fees, not only in England and Wales but also in Scotland(paragraph 211).(34) The Health Departments and the representatives of the professionshould negotiate on the application of the new system of remuneration and of our recommendations to practitioners providing restricted general medical services and on the position of practitioners who employassistants (paragraph 218).Effective date(35) All new rates and payments recommended for hospital medical and dental staff, administrative medical staff, ophthalmic medical practi-practitioners and general medical practitioners should come into effect from 1st April 1966 and are intended to stand for two years (paragraph 21).General dental practitioners(36) The target average net income from the general dental services for allprincipals, full-time and part-time together, working wholly or partly inthese services, should be  3,200 in 1966-67 and  3,325 in 1967-68(paragraph 246).(37) The Dental Rates Study Group should be invited to proceed immediately to fix a scale of fees so as to yield an average net income of  3,200 for theyear beginning 1st April 1966 (paragraph 238).(38) In the early months of 1967 the Dental Rates Study Group should beasked to review the scale of fees for general dental practitioners in thelight of the latest available information, and to propose whateverchanges may be necessary so as to produce an average net income of 3,325 for the year beginning 1st April 1967 (paragraph 238).(39) There should be no change in the scale of fees between the annual reviews by the Dental Rates Study Group, except for the purpose of altering relativities within the scale. If as a result of a rise or fall in average gross earnings there is a measure of overpayment or underpay-ment of dentists during the year between reviews by the Study Group, no attempt should be made either at the time or subsequently to offset theerror in that year (paragraphs 238 and 239).(40) The Health Departments and the British Dental Association should examine their procedures and arrangements so as to enable the DentalRates Study Group to function and complete its work without delay.The Health Departments should consider whether a greater measure of authority can be given to their representatives on the Group, so as toreduce the need for reference back for instructions (paragraph 244).
(41) We attach importance to having recommendations on target net income for general dental practitioners implemented and brought into full effect as soon as possible after the beginning of the period to which they relate(paragraph 245).Health centre dentists(42) For the time being the salary scales of health centre dentists should remain broadly in line with those of local authority dentists (paragraph249).\\11
