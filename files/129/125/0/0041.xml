87copy no.cabinet european LAUNCHER DEVELOPMENT organisation memorandum by the Minister of aviation at their meeting on 9th June (CC(66) 27th Conclusions, Minute 2)the Cabinet authorised me as head of the United Kingdom delegation tothe conference to make clear to our partners our serious doubts aboutthe future technical and economic viability of the European launcher development Organisation (ELDO) but that nevertheless the UnitedKingdom would be prepared to reconsider its position in regard to ELDOif:-(i) An early and substantial reduction in our future contribution toa figure which should not exceed 25 per cent could be negotiated.(ii) An absolute money limit of, say,  40 million were placed onour contribution.(iii) An arrangement could be arrived at whereby the ELDOprogramme would be reviewed annually and would incorporatesuitable safeguards against automatic commitment toescalating costs.2. I circulated a short report of the Conference of 9th-10th June,1966 (C(66) 86). The Final Resolution adopted (Annex A of C(66) 86)proposed, subject to confirmation of Member Governments:-(a) A new scale of contributions for both the initial ELDO A andthe further ELDO PAS programmes with effect from 1stJanuar3^, 1967.(b) That the financial commitments of Member States should belimited to agreed annual amounts and agreed ceilings for individual programmes.3. The proposed new scale, with a comparison of the existingscale, and scales of contribution based on United Nations monthlystatistics (January, 1966, issue, Table 61) of average net national incomes at factor cost for 1962-64 are as follows:--1-C(66) 9128th June, 1966IkIS document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government)

It v/as impossible to get our figure down to 25 per cent since this v/ould have been too great a variation from GNP and v/ould pose too great a burden on the smaller countries who are worried too aboutgetting a greater allocation of work.    An additional difficulty in gettingdown to 25 per cent v/as Australia1 s unwillingness to take a share inthe contributions for ELDO PAS.    She makes no direct financial:contribution to the original programme, but if, however, the Australianoffer to provide some equatorial launch facilities is taken up, or it ismatched by a comparable French proposal, it will have the effect of reducing the total cost.    A GNP basis including Australia would give us 25.05 per cent.5.      As compared with 25 per cent, a 27 per cent contribution v/illinvolve an increase of  2. 6 million in our expenditure over the six years 1966-1972, i. e. from  41.6 million to  44.18 million.    Thefigures are given in detail in paragraph 4 of C(66) 86,6.       The study of necessary amendments to the Convention or theFinancial Protocol to give effect to our proposal to have annual&apos;andoverall programme ceilings of expenditure v/as remitted to a working group charged to report to the resumed Ministerial Conference on 7th-8th July.    Cur proposals were circulated at Annex B of C(66) 86*7.       The Working Group met on 20th-22nd June and is due to meet again on 28fch-30th June.    Its final report is thus not available.     Curproposals have however been well received and it seems likely that thesubstance of what we want will be agreed.    It has also been agreedthat contracts should be placed directly by the Secretariat and as faras possible on a fixed price basis.     There v/ill, however, be difficultyin getting immediate agreement on the amounts of the ceilings Sincethe big reduction in our contribution presents major problems of re-allocation of work if the smaller countries are to get increases ofwork corresponding to their increased contributions.    Agreement onthis may not be reached by 7th July.    We are likely to receive a substantially higher proportion of the work than our new contribution(on the existing basis we get 102 per cent of our contribution, lessadministrative expenses).    However when ceilings of expenditure are agreed they are unlikely to exceed our estimates v/hich make largercontingency allowances thatn those of the ELDO Secretariat.
0.       Other matters on the agenda at the resumed conference are adecision on the location of an equatorial launching site and the reportof a study group on proposals for the co-ordination of European spacepolicy.    No firm decisions are likely to be reached on the latter and onthe question of the equatorial site I consider we should continue acourse of neutrality and support the solution which offers the bestproposition in terms of cost effectiveness (see paragraph 8 of C(66) 86).9.       The Opposition have given notice that they intend to chooseELDG as the subject for a Supply debate on Tuesday, 5th July,    Andat the next Ministerial Conference in Paris on 7th July we are requiredto take firm decisions on the ELDO A and ELDO PAS programmes,10.      I therefore seek authority at the Ministerial Conference on 7thJuly to:-(a) Confirm our continued participation in the ELDO A programme and agree to our participation in the further programme(ELDO PAS) on the basis of the proposed new scale ofcontributions with effect from 1st January, 1967, subject to satisfactory arrangements for the review of programmes andsafeguards against escalating costs.(b) Announce our acceptance of these proposals in the course of the debate in the House.F.
