C(66) 68 COPY NO.       673rd May, 1966CABINETROYAL COMMISSIONS ON LOCAL; GOVERNMENT;TERMS&quot;OF REFERENCE AND organisation memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland andthe Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentFollowing approval by the Cabinet on 27th January(CC(66) 4th Conclusions, Minute 4) of proposals for setting up a RoyalCommission on local government organisation there have beenconsultations with the Departments principally concerned about the termsof reference.    It might be convenient if we were to set out our proposalsfor the terms of reference of the Royal Cosmmissions.Terms of Reference2.     V/e propose the following terms of reference for each Commission&quot;To consider the structure of Local Government (outsideGreater London)^) in relation to its existing functions:and to make recommendations for authorities andboundaries and for functions, having regard to the size and character of areas in which these can be most effectively exercised and the need to sustaina viable system of local democracy. &quot;3,      While this formula would require the Commissions to examinestructure in relation to functions at present exercised by localgovernment, in making recommendations they would not in terms be debarred from proposing some changes.4.     We are sure however that it would be wrong to charge the commissions with a full study of the distribution of functions between central and local government.    To do so would lead them deeply intoquestions of Government organisation: it would provoke requests frominterested bodies for the Commissions to hear evidence and to examinethe case for radical changes in administration of major services, onwhich they will not necessarily be equipped to form judgmental? it wouldprolong their work by diverting effort from the main task of getting the structure right.England only.-1-COMROEMTIALIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT)
5.     On the other hand, we would not -wish to exclude the possibility that the Commission should, in the light of the ideas on structure theyevolve for existing functions, examine whether that structure could conveniently accommodate some function not at present discharged bylocal government; or whether the transfer from local government ofan existing function might not facilitate the creation of a suitableorganisation for the main local government jobs.    But we think theyshould embark on examination of questions of this kind only afterconsultation with the Government.6.     The suggestion has been made that the need for such consultationshould be given formal expression in the terms of reference.    We aresure this would not be right.    We should not ask the Commissions toserve under terms of reference which would openly reserve.to theGovernment freedom to change the terms as they thought fit.    Wethink the purpose could best be secured by an exchange of letters betweenthe Chairmen and ourselves, setting out an understanding that theextent to which the Commissions should concern themselves withexamining the distribution of functions between central and localgovernment v/ould be a matter for consultation.    The Commissionswill no doubt be giving guidance to bodies and persons wishing to submitevidence and this will enable them to steer evidence towards the structurefor discharging present functions.    We may, of course, have to give a fuller account of our intentions about functions, but this can be donemuch more satisfactorily in an explanatory statement than in formalterms of reference.7.      We have ascertained that these terms of reference would be acceptable to the Chairmen designate, but that they would not be content with a form v/hich formally left the scope of the Commission^ work tobe altered from time to time by the Government.Composition of Royal Commissions8.     We shall be seeking the Prime Ministers agreement to thenominations for membership.Timing9.     We have impressed on the prospective Chairmen and members the need for urgency in carrying through their work.    They will aim tomake their report available in not much more than 2 years, and thisshould make it possible, if then desired, to legislate in the fourthsession of this Parliament.I i10.     We would propose to announce the terms of reference and givethe composition of the Royal Commissions as soon as The Queen&apos;approval has been signified.-2-COMRD&apos;EEiW[AL
Staffing of English Commission11.     For the Commission to make the rapid progress we require itwill need to concentrate attention on the main issues and have available a ready source of information over the whole field of its work.    It will need to be able to commission studies on a wide variety of subjects.For  this purpose it is proposed that the Commission should have available a research organisation, headed by an academic with -wide experience in this field, which will be able to draw on Universities aswell as being supported by specialist staff which will be made available from the resources of the Ministry of Housing and Local Government.W.
