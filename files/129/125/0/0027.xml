THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE PROPERTY  OF;,,  HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. June 1966C(66)77 Copy No.    6713th June, 1966CABINETTELECOMMUNICATIONS AND POSTAL TARIFFSMemorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary; of State for Economic AffairsThe Postmaster-General has put to the Ministerial Committeeon Prices and Incomes proposals for changes in telecommuncations and postal rates as follows:Telecommunications tariffs(a) To reduce the cheap rate on dialled trunk calls from two-thirds to one-half the full rate;(b) To increase the minimum fee for calls from STD coin boxesfrom 3d. to 6d.; the effect would be to give the same amount of time for 6d. as at present, but there wouldnot be a shorter time for 3d.;(c) To encourage the renting of coin boxes in such places ashotels and shops and cafes;(d) To reduce the tariff for certain telegraph circuits hired bysubscribers.Postal tariffs(e) To increase the cost of inland parcels (but to introduce anew minimum limit at \\ lb. which would in fact makeparcels up to \\ lb. slightly cheaper than at present, andto provide lower rates for parcels addressed locally);(/) To increase the highest levels of rates for letter post in line with the increases for parcel post;(g) To increase registration fees and the maximum compensation payable;(h) To raise the recorded delivery fee from 6d. to 9d.;(/) To increase all overseas postal rates.The details of his proposals are in his memoranda to the ministerial Committee (PI (66) 2 and 3).6949
2. The new telecommunications tariffs would not substantiallyaffect total revenue. The increase in postal tariffs would raise aboutanother  20 million. The changes would be announced before theHouse rises for the Summer Recess; the postal changes would comeinto effect in October and the telecommunications changes from 1st January, 1967.3. At the same time the Postmaster-General proposes to announce that from October 1967 the printed paper service will be abolished, and that there will be a deferred service for inland letters,at a minimum rate of 3^d. for a letter not exceeding 2 ounces, whichwould run alongside the existing 4d. rate for the standard service.Users of the printed paper service would have to pay more than atpresent, but for ordinary letters people would be given theopportunity of paying a little less for a slower service.4. All these changes can be presented as measures of rationalisation. The reduction of the cheap rate for STD trunk callsgives the consumer the benefit of the modernisation of the telephone system. The proposals on coin boxes should help toincrease the number of boxes available and reduce vandalism. Theparcel post has been losing money for some time; and the reductionof the minimum weight and the rebate for locally addressed parcelswill temper the increases for many people. The abolition of the printed paper rate and the introduction of a combination of standard and deferred services cannot be expected to raise additional revenue,but they make for sensible rationalisation of the service and willprovide a basis for rational tariff development in the future.5. The Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes agreedthat the Postmaster-General should be authorised to make the changes he proposed. In commending this decision to the CabinetI ought to point out the risk that ill-intentioned people will as usualsay that the Government are not slow to put their own prices up,even though they urge others to stabilise theirs; they may also saythat the increase in the minimum fee for telephone calls from coinboxes hits hardest at the people who cannot afford to havetelephones and have to go outside to a call box if they want to ringup. But the Committee thought that we should face these risks and allow the Postmaster-General to go ahead with a range of proposalswhich, taken together, make good sense in terms of rationalisation.6. I am circulating this note for the information of mycolleagues. I do not propose to ask that it should be discussed ata meeting, unless any Minister specifically so requests. I amdiscussing the timing of announcements with the Postmaster-General.G. B.Department of Economic Affairs, S.W.1,10 June, 1966.
