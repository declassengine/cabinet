US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)This paper seeks the support of my colleagues for the early introduction of the Marine etc. Broadcasting (Offences) Bill to eliminate the pirate radio stations.2.     This Bill was prepared in 1964 but it was not included in thelegislative programme for the 1964, 1965 or 1966 Sessions.3.      The situation has now developed in such a way as to make this legislation far more urgent.    Among the new factors are the following:-(a) The establishment of several new pirate stations (one of them,equipped with two transmitters broadcasting two separateprogrammes, financed from America) eager to takeadvantage of the present state of chaos to make quick profits,(b) The threatened establishment of Radio Freedom which haspolitical objectives.(c) The mounting criticism from European countries about inter -ference with their domestic services which can no longer be ignored.(d) The discovery of defects in the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1949v/hich suggest that prosecutions cannot be successfully mountedeven against those stations broadcasting within territoriallimits.(e) The obvious dangers implicit in a situation that allowed RadioCity to be seized by force by a grotupof strong-arm menbeyond the reach of police action.(f) The growing evidence that gangsterism is thriving in thisatmosphere.(g) The increasing volume of public and press criticism of theGovernments inaction which makes&apos; it much easierpolitically for us to legislate than at one time seemQdpossible,(h) The likelihood that a Private Member&apos;s Bill will beintroduced soon by a Government back-bencher to fill the gap left by the Governments deferment of the Bill.C(66) 9428th June, 1966COPY NO.CABINETPIRATE broadcasting memorandum by the Postmaster General
(i)     The general feeling that what is at stake is now much more thanthe maintenance of international telecommunications agree-ments and involves wider questions of law and order and theGovernment^ will to enforce it.(j)     The fact that the longer the legislation is delayed the harderit will be to deal with the problem.(k)    The indications that the Opposition might facilitate the passageof the Bill and hence reduce the Parliamentary time required.4. For these reasons I believe that legislation cannot properly be deferred any longer, and I ask my colleagues to agree that the Bill benow published and enacted as soon as possible.5.     Some consideration has been given to combining the anti-pirate Bill with the anti-evasion Bill for which a space had been set aside in the current Session.    However work on the anti-evasion Billis not yet far enough advanced to enable a combined draft Bill to beready before the summer recess.    I do not believe that the anti-pirate Bill can be delayed meanwhile.6.      Proposals v/hich would provide alternative sources of lightmusic and would allow the licensing of local radio will be reported to cabinet soon and if accepted will make the passage of the anti-pirateBill much easier.    However consideration of these issues should notbe allowed to delay an early announcement of the government&apos;s decision to proceed with the Marine etc. Broadcasting (Offences) Bill.7,     I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that the Bill should beintroduced as soon as possible, and certainly before the summer recess;that I should make an announcement in the House to this effect at once;and that the passage of the Bill should be expedited.A, W. B.General Post Office, E. C. 1.28th June, 1966.-2-
