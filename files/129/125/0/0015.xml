SECRET V      154is DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C(66) 6527th April, 1966CABINETMINISTRY OF SOCIAL SECURITY bill memorandum by the Minister ox Pensionsand National insurance am now ready to introduce a Bill (the Ministry of social security Bill) giving effect to my proposals for remodelling national assistance which were summarised in C. (65) 176 and approved by theCabinet (C. C. (65) 70th Conclusions, Minute 2).    If, as the cabinet agreed, these proposals - affecting more than two million people -are to be brought into operation in the autumn of this year, it is   &apos;essential that the Bill receives Royal Assent before the summer recess.    I understand that this can be guaranteed if the Bill is published no later than 2nd May, for Second Reading on 10th May,although the Chancellor of the Exchequer v/ould prefer it not to beintroduced before the middle of May.     I should not object to thisprovided Royal Assent could still be guaranteed before the summer recess.    No such guarantee is at present available with a later dateof introduction.    I must therefore seek urgent decisions on twoaspects of my proposals which the Chancellor questions.    I comment on these below.The long-term addition2.      The first is my proposal for the long-term addition (to theordinary scale rates) for the old and for others (apart from theunemployed) who have been on national assistance or non-contributorybenefit for two years, to take the place of smaller discretionaryadditions.    This is a major feature of the scheme.    My original proposal, as approved, was to set this addition at a level of 7s. 6d.but in existing cases to ensure that no more than 4s. 6d. of this was set off against current discretionary additions, so that all gained atleast 3a, from it.     It has since been possible to examine the incidence of discretionary additions in more detail, and in the light of this I havemodified my original proposals in a way which I am sure makes themeven more attractive at no more cost and at a slight initial saving.Instead of setting the addition at 7s. 6d. with a 3s. concession for existing cases, I propose that the long-term addition should be 9s.with no concession.    This will be fairer and it will enable us to dispense at the outset with discretionary additions for the greatmajority of our old people receiving assistance.    Thus we can gomuch further in implementing our intention to make discretionaryadditions, and the enquiries that necessarily go v/ith them, reallyexceptional.COPY NO.-1-
The basic rates3.     I propose to limit the increase in the basic rates to the amountnecessary to meet the increase in the cost of living since the present rates were introduced in March, 1965.     This will mean 5s. a weekmore for a single householder, and 7s. 6d. a week for a married couple.The guaranteed income 1 evel4.      Taking together the basic scale rate as increased by 5s. fora single householder from 76s. to 81s. a week with a long-term additionof 9s. , we shall achieve an income level for our old people and otherlong-term cases on the new benefit of  4. 10s. a week for the singlehouseholder, rent, of course, being allowed in addition.     the attraction of this speaks for itselC    Since the new benefit will inevitably be regarded as a substitute for income guarantee, and since a major object of the new scheme is to attract needy people who have not so far applied, the importance of launching it with asingle rate which looks both round and as generous as we can makeit needs no emphasis.5.      The Chancellor would, I understand, prefer the long-termaddition to stay at 7s. 6d. with no concession   to existing cases.The rate would then be  4. 8s. 6d,    This would save  6 million ina full year but, as my colleagues will be aware, the total cost of my proposals,  65 million in a full year, can in fact be accommodated within my approved programme of expenditure under the national plan on the basis that there should be some limitation of expenditureon the next general uprating.    It has already been decided that Ishould limit the uprating due in mid-1967 by about Is. for this purpose.Some such reduction would, of course, still be necessary even withthe saving of   6 million.The disregards6.     I understand that the Chancellor is concerned because in somecases the combination of the scale rates, rent, the long-term addition,and disregards will bring the claimants&apos; income above the old age taxexemption limits and he would like the disregards to be reduced.    i must remind my colleagues that the Social Services Committee spenttwo full meetings on the disregards when they were considering income guarantee, during which the original proposals were substantiallymodified.    In the annex to my memorandum to the Social services committee S. S. (65) 20 I was careful to put before the Committee a fullexposition of the income tax problem in this connection.    The principalmodifications made by the Committee were to add to the disregard ofdisability pensions and earnings originally proposed a disregard of  1 a week of other income, including superannviation, but not themain national insurance pensions etc. , and maintenance payments;and to be more generous about capital for people without disregardedincome.    These two go together; the  extra capital of  5 00 allowedto the man without a disregard would, at 65, buy an annuity of 20s. aweek, which would be disregarded.    Thus there is equitable treatment as between saving for old age by investment, and by contributing to asuperannuation fund.
7.     When I was commissioned by the Cabinet to remodel national assistance incorporating as many features of Income Guarantee aspossible, I naturally included these disregards in my proposals to theSocial Services Committee and they were there accepted.    Theproposal to rationalise and modernise the disregards was includedin my memorandum on non-contributory benefits (C. (65) 176) and itwill be recalled that these proposals were welcomed.    Anything lessthan these disregards would in my judgment be politically unacceptable,both to our own back-benchers and in the country at large.    We found it impossible, in framing Income Guarantee, against the background ofexisting national assistance disregards to take a severe line;   and bythe same token, we could not take a severe line in remodellingnational assistance.    The proposed disregards do little more thanrestore the value of the existing disregards established by theprevious administration as long ago as 1959, and for some peopleindeed are less favourable.8.     As for taxation, a number of assistance recipients are alreadyabove the tax exemption limit and the Inland Revenue deal with thisadministratively by ignoring such payments.    Admittedly ray proposalstend to aggravate this problem but it cannot possibly be solved bymanipulating the disregards.     A solution could only be found by introducing also some completely new provision limiting payments forrent so as to keep within the tax exemption limit and, even if this could be worked out in time, it would destroy what has always been a fundamental feature of means-tested benefit, namely that reasonablerent is met in full.summary.     I seek the Cabinetls agreement that -(i) the Ministry of Social Security Bill should be introduced intime to ensure Royal iissent before the summer recess;(ii) the long-term addition should be 9s. a week, making a guaranteed income level, after payment of rent, of  4. 10s.a week for old people living alone;(iii) the new benefits should be exempt from income tax;(iv) the proposals for disregards of income and capital atpresent embodied in the Bill should remain unchanged.M.H.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, W. C, 2.26th April, 1966
