HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 549th March, 1966CABINETRE-ORGANISATION OF THE POCKSMemorandum by the M inister of Lab ourWe have announced our intention to set up a National PortsAuthority and Regional Port Authorities which would ultimately become responsible for all port operations including stevedoring.    It will take time to prepare and pass the necessary legislation and for the newbodies to be set up and become effective.     We must decide what to doabout the docks during this period.2.     In my view we should not allow the present casual system ofemployment with its inefficiencies to continue.    Dock workers areexpecting early decisions on a new pay structure related to regular employment, and on improved pensions and a sick pay scheme.Negotiations are very far advanced on these matters.    As part of thesettlement it is intended that restrictive practices associated with thecasual system should go.3.      Rapid improvement of welfare amenities for dock workers is needed.     This cannot be secured without new legislation.4.     For these reasons we should, for the immediate future, seek to get the industry to reach the settlement referred to above and proceed with decasiialisation on the basis of a revised Dock labour scheme and legislation on licensing and amenities, together with theMinister of Transports proposals for improving port efficiency.R, J, G.Ministry of Labour, S.
