CONFIDENTIAL ,        g g 7-IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 92 COPY NO.28th June, 1966CABINET67AUTHORISATION OF IMMEDIATE INCREASES INTHE LOCAL AUTHORITY HOUSING PROGRAMMELaemorandum by the Minister of Housing andLocal GovernmentBackgroundThe Government are committed to completing 500,000 houses(United Kingdom) in 1970.     The Housing White Paper assumed that private builders would contribute about half this number but in view oftheir performance over the past year it is far from certain that theywill achieve this,2,       This year, for the third year in succession, the total numberof houses completed in both sectors is likely to be in the range of380-400,000 (United Kingdom).    We have new got to ensure that theannual rate of completions climbs off this plateau towards the 500, 000v/hich has to be achieved in four years&apos; time.     Unless we provide forthe whole programme to move forward steadily, the target will not beachieved, or will be achieved only by provoking an exaggerated boomin one or two years in the quinquennium, with all the troubles which that entails.The short-term prospect3.       Housing is not going well this year.    The failure is in theprivate sector.    Private housebuilders started 84,000 houses inGreat Britain in the first five months of 1966 against 98, 000 in 1965,Completions in the same period were 81,000 as against 86,000.    Wecannot count on private housebuilders starting even 200,000 houses in1966.4.       I have taken a number of steps to restore the confidence ofprivate builders (particularly the small and medium sized firms v/hichbuild some 60 per cent of houses for sale) in relation to the selective employment tax which the National Federation of Building TradesEmployers have told me will be very valuable.    In addition the optionmortgage scheme will make home ownership possible for new sectionsof the community.    Even so we cannot rely upon the private sector to restore the situation,5.       The only assured means of maintaining a better rate ofcompletions in 1967 and 1968 is to step up the local authority programmenow, by giving additional approvals in the rest of this year.-1-
Liocal authority programme.       When the Cabinet considered housing programmes in July last(C.C.(65) 39th Conclusions, Minute 1;  and C.C.(65) 43rd Conclusions,Minute 3) the level of local authority approvals in England and wales was set at1965 150,0001966 150,0001967 155,0001968 162, 5001969 170,0007.       In April the Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed to an extra3, 500 approvals this year in England.     This small additional programme was immediately allocated to selected authorities who had schemes readyto put to tender.    Nearly all will be built by industrialised orrationalised traditional methods and much of the work on them will becarried out in 1966 (some 1, 000 may be completed this year).8.       I estimate that this year non-priority authorities in England,whom i have so far had to restrain, could take up a further 7, 500approvals without over-straining the capacity of the housebuildingindustry.    (There is no scope for increasing the programmes of the priority authorities because they are&apos; already being allowed to build to capacity).9.       Though some of the extra 7, 500 may be started late this year,most are likely tobe started early next spring and completed in thefirst part of 1968.10,       The need for an increase in the local authority housing programme was considered by the Prime L.inister&apos;s Committee on housing (MISC 113) who agreed (the position of the Chancellor of theExchequer being reserved) to recommend that an extra 7, 500 shouldbe authorised.Extra approvals for coal miners1 houses11.        Lord Robens reqtiires as soon as possible 7,100 houses inEngland for miners transferred, under the accelerated colliery closureprogramme, to expanding pits mainly in Yorkshire and the Midlands;and he may need a further 4, 800 later.     This large number of housescannot be accommodated within the ordinary local authority housing programme which has already been committed.     Contracts for building these extra houses, if authorised, can be let early next yearand an increase is therefore required in the 1967 programme.12.       I seek approval for the following infereases in the Englandlocal authority housing programme: -1966: 7, 500 approvals for general needs1967: 7,100 approvals for miners&apos; houses.R..
