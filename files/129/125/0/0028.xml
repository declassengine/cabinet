Health and Welfare -Development of Community CarePURPOSE OF PLANS1. In 1962 local health and welfare authorities were asked for the first time toprepare ten-year plans for the long-term development of their health and welfare services and to keep those plans under review. A summary of the plans with ageneral commentary on the services and on the plans themselves was published in April, 1963 (Cmnd. 1973). Later in that year authorities were asked to draw up revised plans to 1974 on a somewhat more extended scale, and a summary ofthese plans was published in July, 1964. In July, 1965 the Minister of Healthcalled for a second revision on a comparable basis with the first, covering the decade 1966-76, with annual forecasts up to 1971 and a single forecast for thesecond quinquennium. In this volume the revised plans of local authoritiesprepared in response to this request are presented in summary and analysed.2. The national summaries at the end of the volume, for England and Walestogether and for Wales (with Monmouthshire), set out total numbers of different types of premises and places with ratios to population; numbers of selectedtypes of staff with ratios to population; forecasts of capital and revenue ex- ;penditure; and detailed numbers of the different types of staff estimated to berequired. In these tables, and throughout the analysis of the plans in the following paragraphs, figures relating to premises, places and expenditure are for thefinancial year ending 31st March (or for that date itself), and figures relating to staff are for 31st December. Staff totals given for 31st December, 1965 are notactual, but as expected by each authority at the date of the return.3. Although the revised plans are on a basis similar to that of the lastrevision, precise comparison may not always be possible in some areas owing tointervening changes sometimes substantial in local government boundaries.This is particularly true of South-Eastern England, where the changes cominginto operation on 1st April 1965,* as a consequence of the London government act created the Greater London Council with responsibility for the ambulanceservice, and thirty-two London Boroughs and the City as authorities with health and welfare powers, which not only replaced the London and Middlesex CountyCouncils and the County Boroughs of Croydon, East Ham and West Ham, butalso reduced the areas of the four health and welfare authorities for Essex,Hertfordshire, Kent and Surrey. The changes in responsibility in greater london have also inevitably caused difficulties for the new authorities in makingplans which are for them not a revision but a new beginning; and the results oftheir work contained in this volume are a tribute to their energy and vision.4. Forward planning by local authorities fulfils a number of importantpurposes. In the first place it provides an opportunity to each local authority to perform the essential task of reviewing its past performance, its present needs and its future expectations, and to do so in close consultation with the bodiesresponsible for related services. Reference is made at a number of points in thefollowing paragraphs to the wide and varied contribution made by voluntary bodies of all kinds. These play an invaluable part, not only as pioneers ofuntried measures but as providers of essential services. The training of the*For the London Boroughs the figures shown for 31st March, 1965 in the Tables in Appen-dix A relate to the Services as taken over from 1st April, 1965
mentally subnormal, the accommodation of the elderly and the mentally orphysically handicapped, the running of social clubs and centres for all these groups, and friendly visiting in the home, are outstanding examples of the helpthat voluntary bodies can give; and local authorities must and do gladly take account of that help in making their own plans.5. No less account must be taken of the part played by other health services,notably general practice and the hospitals. The community services providedby local authorities cannot be planned in isolation, but must be seen along withthese other services as parts of an integral programme for promoting health and social well-being. The future pattern of general practice, which is bound up with the development of local authority domiciliary services, will increasinglybe a pattern of doctors working in groups from shared premises with fullsupporting help. Many general practitioners are wanting to provide this kind ofservice from health centres. The importance of joint planning with executive councils, local medical committees and others concerned was accordinglyurged by the Minister when inviting hospital Boards and local authorities toundertake the present revision of their plans (H.M. (65)37 and Circular 14/65).Special mention was also made of the need for joint planning by local authoritiesand hospital Boards of services for the elderly and the mentally disordered; and memoranda of September, 1965 on the former and of December 1965 on thelatter were sent to both types of authority to assist in their joint planning. Timedid not allow of close consultation in every area on this occasion, but a usefulbeginning was made on what must necessarily be a continuing and repeatedexchange of views. Such co-ordination is a vital element in the proper provisionof local health and welfare services.6. The second purpose of forward planning is to provide information on anational as well as a local basis against which local authorities can comparptheir own performance and their own plans for the future. This aspect is further discussed in paragraphs 43 to 87 below. &apos;7. A third important purpose is to provide a basis for systematic developmentwithin the framework of the overall National Plan. The relationship between local authorities&apos; forecasts and the provision made for development of theirhealth and welfare services as an element in the growth of public expenditure asa whole is considered in paragraphs 88 to 93 below.
SCOPE OF PLANS8. The picture of services presented by the plans is inevitably incomplete. not all aspects of the services lend themselves to forecasting in this way, particularly those which are provided by voluntary effort, whose valuable contribution isonly partially reflected in the figures. Nor do the forecasts reveal improvements in quality of service through better use of staff or premises for example, the closer association of health visitors and others with general practitioners; jointuse of staff by local authorities and hospitals; the provision of night attendance;the arrangements made for recreation in clubs or centres for the elderly ormentally or physically handicapped; preventive work in relation to families in danger of break-up or of eviction, and work with &quot;problem&quot; families in general;the replacement of obsolete premises by modern accommodation. Nor could the plans take into account any possible changes in the organisation of these local government services as a result of the recommendations of the SeebohmCommittee.9. What the plans can and do reveal, however, are the broad foundations onwhich the developing services must be based, and the ways in which thosefoundations are to be strengthened and extended. The first aim of the services is essentially preventive to maintain health and welfare in the home, and toprovide those supporting services outside the home which contribute to avoidingor postponing the need for residential care or which will guard against furtherbreakdown after treatment and discharge from hospital care. The extent towhich this aim is already attained, or is to be better attained in the future, canin some degree be derived from the figures of domiciliary staff, of clinics andcentres, and of sheltered (&quot;special&quot;) housing contained in the plans. The secondaim of the services is to provide special residential care for those who for one reason or another can no longer live in their own homes or have no homes. here the rough yardstick is the number of places, whether in homes for the elderly,or homes for the physically handicapped, or hostels for the mentally disordered,(though the contribution made by voluntary homes and by private householdsfor the mentally disordered, which does not appear in the returns, must not be overlooked). And in relation to both aims the forecasts of revenue and capitalexpenditure reflect the degree of growth and improvement which local authori-ties have set as their objectives.
IMPLEMENTING THE PLANS-PROGRESS ALREADY MADE10. The fact that local authority health and welfare services are developingis well known, from the information published by the authorities themselves andfrom that contained in the Ministry&apos;s Annual Reports. The extent of this development, and more particularly the extent to which local authorities aresucceeding in reaching earlier forecasts, can however be more clearly seen fromthe successive ten-year plans; and the immediately following paragraphs 11 to 39analyse and comment on the progress revealed by the present revision inrelation to the main services provided.Domiciliary Staff11. Health Visitors. The number of persons visited continues to grow, with the rising number of children under five and with increased visiting of the elderly.Recruitment in 1964 was however disappointing, and the number of healthvisitors in whole-time equivalents employed at the end of 1964 was 5,393 corn-pared with a forecast of 5,830 for that date in the first revised plans. The presentreturns show a figure of 5,846 for the end of 1965, still rather lower than the forecast of 6,127 in the first revision.12. On 1st April, 1965, (Circular 8/65), the Minister reminded local health authorities that because over 2,000 health visitors in England and Wales wereaged between 50 and 60 it would be necessary to increase considerably thenumbers to be trained in the immediate future. The attention of authoritieswas drawn to the measures being taken by the Council for the Training ofHealth Visitors to stimulate recruitment to health visiting as a profession.Authorities were asked to give practical support to the CounciPs efforts bysponsoring suitably qualified students for training; by sponsoring suitable healthvisitors to train as field work instructors and by providing facilities for fieldwork instruction in their area; and by sponsoring the training of suitablyqualified health visitors to take posts as tutors.13. Home Midwives. The number of home confinements continues to fall(261,907 in 1964 compared with 270,831 in 1963), but this is accompanied by a sharp rise in the number of women discharged early after confinement in hospital and attended by midwives at home (227,480 in 1964 compared with 178,698 in1963). The number of home midwives employed (in whole-time equivalents) fellduring 1964 from 5,309 to 5,298, but the present returns show a figure of 5,643at the end of 1965. This total was below the forecast of 5,689 at the end of 1964contained in the first revised plans; but although there may be undue pressure in some (mainly rural) areas owing to recruitment difficulties, there is no indication at present of any serious general shortage.14. On 30th April, 1965, the Minister wrote to all authorities concerned inEngland and Wales commending the introduction of schemes for planned earlydischarge of maternity cases. Circular 6/65, which indicated to local health authorities the part they have to play in such schemes, reminded authorities thatthe post-natal care of patients discharged under these arrangements is (in association with the general practitioner) a matter for domiciliary midwives or district nurse/midwives; and that relief could be given to those midwives whoalready have a heavy case-load by recruiting part-time midwives for whom this work is particularly suitable.
15. Home Nurses. For several years the total number of persons nursed intheir homes has been falling, but at the same time the proportion of the elderlyamong them has been rising. There seems little doubt that the work load tends to rise, since nursing the elderly takes more time. It is therefore encouraging thatthe number of home nurses (in whole-time equivalents) rose by 317 in 1964 and continued to rise in 1965. The total at the end of 1965 shown in the presentreturns is 8,359.16. There remains none the less a need to ensure that the best use is made ofspecial nursing skills, and in June 1965 (Circular 12/65) the Minister commendedto local health authorities the report of a Sub-Committee which had consideredthe extent to which the nursing team in the local authority services could be developed, and how far its effectiveness could be increased by the employmentof other professional and non-professional workers. The report suggested thatthere was scope for ancillary staffs to be used much more widely, and recom-mended that authorities who had not already done so should undertake localstudies of the content and methods of the work done by their nursing staffs.The report made specific recommendations about the type of duties whichmight be delegated to ancillary workers.17. Home Helps. The total employed (in whole-time equivalents) at the endof 1963 was 27,311 and 28,237, at the end of 1964, the latter figure being 1,101below the forecast figure in the first revised plans. But the present returns showa total of 30,005 at the end of 1965, or 867 below the forecast for that year. InDecember 1965 (Circular 25/65) the Minister emphasised to local authorites theimportance of the home help service (which assists an increasing number ofpersons every year, particularly among the elderly and the chronic sick),suggested ways of further developing it including the mounting of special studiesand the improvement of training, and urged the discontinuance of charges for persons receiving National Assistance allowances or at a similar level of income.18. Social Workers. Encouraging progress has been made since 1963 in the recruitment of social workers. The total of 4,004 shown in the present returnsat the end of 1965 exceeds by 461 the total forecast for that date in the firstrevised plans; and although within that total the figures for staff with relevantUniversity or equivalent professional training (347) and staff holding the certifi-cate in social work of the Council for Training in Social Work (306) were some-what lower than the forecast, they nevertheless represent increases since 1963 of132 and 253. The number of welfare assistants, though increased from 823 to893, falls short of the forecast of 1,024 for the end of 1965.Ambulance Service19. In recent years the numbers of hospital in-patients and out-patientscarried by the ambulance service have grown out of proportion to the increasein the number of patients treated. There has been an even greater proportionate increase in the numbers of patients transported to training centres, clubs, etc.,as more of these units have been opened.20. Although there was a growth of over 11 per cent in the work of the service between March 1963 and March 1965, the same period saw a fall of 3 per centin the number of stations arid rises of 5 per cent in the number of ambulances andof 3-5 per cent in the number of staff. Local authorities have been making pro-
gress in replacing small and unsuitable premises by larger purpose-built stations,and by improved efficiency have been able to do more work without a parallelincrease in capital investment. The present returns suggest however, that during1965 the point was reached at which it became necessary to recruit more staffif quality of service was not to fall. Partly no doubt in anticipation of a reductionin weekly working hours from 42 to 40 as from 1st January, 1966, the numberof staff shown at 31st December, 1965 was 14,149, an increase of over 4 per centin nine months. This total was very near the forecast of 14,239 for that datemade in the first revised plans.Centres and clinics21. Health centres. A significant development of the last year or two has beenthe upsurge of interest in health centres, that is premises which combine facilitiesfor general practitioner and for local health authority services, and sometimesinclude consultant out-patient facilities, as at Hythe near Southampton. Thefirst local authority plans forecast the provision of 26 additional health centres in the ten years ending March, 1972, making a total of 52, and the first revisedplans the provision of 42 additional in the ten years ending March, 1974, makinga total of 68. The present returns show that by the end of March, 1965,the number in operation had already reached 36; and at the end of 1965 six were being builtor extended, 25 were fully planned or at an advanced stage, and a further 50schemes were believed to be already under local consideration. This represents a remarkable and welcome rate of development.22. Maternity and child welfare clinics. Increases in the numbers of expectantand nursing mothers and of young children attending have been accompaniedby a growth in the number of clinics and also by the replacement of old and unsatisfactory premises. At 31st March, 1963, 6,317 clinics were in use, and thetotal had risen to 6,452 by 31st March, 1965, close to the figure of 6,487 forecast for 1969 in the first revised plans.23. Training centres for the subnormal. The total number of places in trainingcentres for subnormal adults and children rose from 26,624 at the end of 1962to 32,857 at the end of 1964 and to 34,118 by 31st March, 1965. In addition localauthorities had at the end of 1962 the use of260 places in centres run by voluntary organisations and 447 at the end of 1964. In the 3 years 1963-1965 48 centresoccupying unsatisfactory premises, containing 2,037 places, were closed and replaced by purpose-built centres. At the end of 1962, 26-9 per cent of the placeswere in centres for children only, 22-8 per cent in centres for adults only and50-3 per cent in centres taking both children and adults. The correspondingpercentages for the end of 1964, 32-3 per cent, 28-9 per cent and 38-8 per centindicate a welcome trend.24. The total number of people attending the centres on any date is less thanthe total number of places, particularly in a period such as the present when newcentres are being opened at the rate of about one a week. Moreover, thenumbers of children and adults attending do not always correspond with thenumber of places allocated to the two age-groups; for instance, in areas whichare short of adult training centres, young adults may remain in a junior training
centre. The allocation of places between children and adults and the numbersattending, at the end of 1962 and 1964, were: Places Number Attending Number receiving1962 home trainingChildren xw         lt , ,              13,540 293Adults Not separately recorded U142 1017Total                     26,624 24,682 1,3101964Children                 17,804 14,952 214Adults                   15,053 15,016 926Total -:x,               32,857 29,968 1,14025. The staff of these training centres (excluding nursery attendants and domestic staff) rose from 2,324 on December 31st, 1962, to a figure of 3,566 forDecember, 1965. This gives a ratio of staff to places of 1 to 11-4 for December,1962, and 1 to 9-5 for 1965. Thus, although the number of staff shown forDecember, 1965, is less than the 3,932 forecast for that date in the first revisedplans published in 1964, recruitment has more than kept pace with the increasein places.26. Social centres and clubs for the mentally disordered. At the end of 1962,local authorities were running 81 social centres or clubs for the mentally ill andhad arrangements with another 31 run by voluntary bodies. At the end of 1964the numbers had risen to 150 and 57 and at 31st March, 1965, the number run by local authorities was 162. For the subnormal there were 64 social centres orclubs run by local authorities at the end of 1962 and 47 by voluntary bodies; atthe end of 1964, 99 run by local authorities and 55 by voluntary bodies; at 31stMarch, 1965, the number run by local authorities had risen to 142. These socialclubs are sometimes held in the evenings in buildings used as training centresduring the day.27. Centres for the physically handicapped. These are provided by voluntary bodies as well as local authorities, and offer opportunities for purposefuloccupation, for the provision of various services, and for recreation and sociallife. They range from small premises with limited facilities available only part-time to purpose-built centres equipped and staffed to offer a full range of facilities for all types of physically handicapped persons including work centres and craft rooms, meeting places for clubs, midday meals, baths and hairdressing.As the provision of services has stimulated the registration of those in need ofthem and the numbers registered (particularly of those with handicaps other thanthose of sight or hearing) has grown, local authorities have themselves providedmore centres, the total increasing from 1,288 at the end of March, 1963, to1,384 at the end of March, 1965.28. Centres for the elderly. Day centres for the elderly provide primarilysocial contact and recreation, and some constitute also a focus for various services. Their nature varies widely, like those for the physically handicapped,and they are supplemented by over 7,000 social clubs for the elderly run by voluntary bodies. It appears that a number of clubs of this kind were includedin the returns for March, 1963 in the first revised plans when the total numberrecorded was 198, but these have been excluded from the figure of 115 for march, 1965.
Residential accommodation29. Subnormal adults. The number of subnormal adults resident in local health authority hostels rose from 479 at the end of 1962 to 954 at the end of1964; the present returns record 1,446 places at 31st March, 1965. In addition,the authorities were maintaining 295 adults in voluntary or privately run homes,and 277 boarded out in private households at the end of 1962, and 555 and 345respectively at the end of 1964. This accommodation is needed in order toprovide for the subnormal who live with their families in childhood and earlyadult life but eventually need other provision and who in former years wouldthen have gone into public assistance institutions or hospitals. It also allows forthe discharge from hospital of patients who are fit to live in the general com-munity if suitable occupation and training and residential care are available.30. Subnormal children. At the end of 1962, 176 subnormal children wereresident in local authority hostels; by 31st March, 1965, 900 places were provided. In addition, the authorities were maintaining 112 children in voluntaryor privately run homes and 96 boarded out in private households at the end of1962, and 212 and 77 respectively at the end of 1964. Many children needresidential care only during the week or the equivalent of a school term, toenable them to attend a training centre, returning home at weekends or for school holidays.31. Mentally ill. The number of places in local health authority hostels for the mentally ill rose from 323 at the end of 1962 to 1,084 at the end of 1964. Thesefigures include a few hostels specifically for the elderly mentally infirm provided under the National Health Service Act, but most of the elderly mentally infirmare accommodated in general old peoples&apos; homes or in a few special homesprovided under the National Assistance Act. All accommodation for the elderlymentally infirm, under either Act, is included in the ten-year plans in the figuresof accommodation for the elderly. The figure of 831 places in hostels for the mentally ill at 31st March, 1965, and forecasts for future years, in the presentten-year plans are therefore not comparable with the figures quoted above for1962 and 1964. In addition, at the end of 1962 local health authorities weremaintaining 404 mentally ill people (or people recovering from mental illness),including 2 children, in voluntary or privately run homes, and 18 boarded outin private households; at the end of 1964 the corresponding figures were 611(including 6 children) and 47.32. Staff of hostels for the mentally disordered. The ratio of staff (excludingdomestic staff) to places in hostels for the mentally ill and subnormal taken together was 1 to 7 in December, 1962, and 1 to 5-1 on March 31st, 1965.33. Physically handicapped. In March, 1963,65 homes provided 6,079 places for the physically handicapped of all ages; in March, 1965 there were 75 provid-ing 7,071 places, and both the total numbers of residents and of the youngerphysically handicapped in homes of all kinds had risen substantially. about one-third of those under 65 are in accommodation provided on behalf of thelocal authorities by voluntary organisations. There are now in England 7 localauthority purpose-built homes for the younger physically handicapped. Thereis as yet insufficient experience to provide authorities with detailed guidance in a building Note, but in November, 1965 (Circular 22/65) the Minister gave broadguidance on the standards considered desirable at the present time, particular
emphasis being placed on the need to provide homely premises for small numbers. Attention was drawn to the relief which can be given to relativescaring for the severely handicapped by the provision of places in these homes for short-stay care.34. Elderly. In terms of expenditure and extent the main feature of localauthority services for the elderly is residential care, which they provide mainlydirectly but also by arrangement with voluntary organisations. At the end ofMarch, 1963, authorities were providing 83,807 places for the elderly in resi-dential homes (including those for the mentally infirm and the physicallyhandicapped), representing a ratio of 14-8 per 1,000 people aged 65 and overand expected by March, 1964 to have reached a net figure (after any closures) of87,637, a ratio of 15-3. The present returns show that in March, 1965 they wereproviding 90,995 places for the elderly in these homes, a ratio of 15-6. Theyhave thus been able to keep up to their expectations and go some way to meetincreased demands, though too many elderly people remain in former PublicAssistance Institutions or other large institutions.35. Staff of homes for the elderly. Changes in the basis of the returns, andthe inclusion in the returns of places but not of staff in voluntary homes pro-viding accommodation for local authorities, combine to make impracticableany exact comparisons of ratios of staff to places. But broadly it can be saidthat a rise in the total number of places in homes for the elderly (includingplaces for persons under 65) from 85,000 in March, 1963 to 92,000 in March,1965 has been paralleled by a rise in the number of staff from 12,300 in Dec-ember, 1963 to about 15,000 in December, 1965, that is to the number forecast for that date in the first revised plans.Expenditure36. Revenue expenditure. Revenue expenditure on local health and welfare services in recent years, adjusted as far as possible to the level of pay and prices at June, 1965 (the level used by local authorities in preparing their plans) isshown in Table 1.Table 1  millionNet Revenue Expenditure^ (at June, 1965prices)Year	Health	Welfare	Total1959/60	80	-t	_1960/61	83	-1	 1961/62    ..	88	-t	 1962/63    ..	91	31	1221963/64	95	35	1301964/65	100	37	137These figures are net, after taking account of estimated payments by recipients of theI  services.tlnsufficient information is available to adjust welfare expenditure for these years to June,1965 prices.
37. In the five years to 1964-65, local health authority expenditure increasedby 25 per cent at constant prices; i.e., on average, just over 4J per cent perannum. Between 1962-63 and 1964-65, expenditure on local health and welfare services together increased by about 12 per cent compared with a forecast of15 per cent made by local authorities in their first ten-year plan.38. Capital expenditure. The volume of capital investment (including sites,vehicles and equipment) for which local authorities have had loan sanctionsis set out in the Table below.Table 2   million*Capital expenditure by the London County Council (which ceased to exist on 31st Maicu1965) was financed under borrowing powers obtained by annual legislation and is not included.The figures in the table relate to loan sanctions recommended by theMinistry of Health in each year for issue by the Ministry of Housing andLocal Government and the Welsh Office. Capital expenditure met by localauthorities out of revenue and special funds is not included : the total expendi-ture met in this way increased from  3-6 million in 1962-63 to an estimated 4-4 million in 1965-66.39. Although the total of loan sanctions has each year increased in real terms(except during 1965-66 when the start of most projects was deferred for sixmonths in accordance with general Government economic policy) the capital programmes forecast by authorities in their plans in 1962 and 1964 have notbeen realised. The first plans forecast capital expenditure of an average of about 30 million per annum in the five years 1962-63 to 1966-67. The first revisedplans forecast an average expenditure of about  32 million per annum in thefive years 1964-65 to 1968-69. Nevertheless, apart from the special circum-stances arising from the deferments 1965-66 mentioned above, applications forloan sanction by local authorities as a whole have not so far exceeded theamounts it has been possible to recommend for issue; and it seems clear that in framing their plans local authorities have generally tended to over-estimate the speed with which they are able to bring forward proposals for capital expendi-ture.Year1962-631963-641964-651965-66Capital Expenditure^(at June, 1965 prices)Loan Sanctions16-320-122-416-5
THE REVISED PLANS-DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND 1965-7640. Population trends, especially for the very young and the elderly, are theessential background against which the community health and welfare services must be studied and their development planned. The following table supplied by the General Register Office shows for England and Wales the estimatedmid-year home population and births in 1965 together with projections of thesefigures during the period covered by the 10-year plans : Table 31965        1971        1976      Percentage increase1976 over 1965Mid year homepopulation (1,000s)aged 0-4 4,113       4,541        4,725 15aged 5-64 37,821 39,239      40,619 7aged 65 and over       5,829       6,466       7,017 20all ages 47,763      50,246      52,361 10Live births(1,000s) 864 948 968 12Still births(1,000s) 14 12 10 -2941. The population growth of 10 per cent for all ages during this period results from a considerably faster rate of growth for children under school age andfor the elderly than for the population aged 5-64. The overall increase of15 per cent for children aged 0-4, slightly exceeds the increase in total livebirths; if as expected there is an increase in the proportion of hospital con-finements, the number of domiciliary births may not increase at all, and may even continue to fall.42. The number of people aged 65 and over is expected to increase by 20 percent between 1965 and 1976, twice as fast as the total population. Within this group, the numbers aged 65 to 74 will increase at a slightly higher rate (22 percent) than that (17 per cent) for those aged 75 and over. This trend is peculiar tothis particular period covered by the 10-year plans; by the 1980&apos;s there will bean ageing of the population within the 65 and over group.
THE REVISED PLANS-FORECASTS OF SERVICES ANDEXPENDITURE43. The following paragraphs analyse and comment on the main features ofthe picture presented by the national figures in the current forecasts. Paragraphs44 to 55 deal with the staff of domiciliary services; paragraphs 56 and 57 withambulance services; paragraphs 58 to 70 with centres and clinics; paragraphs71 to 74 with special housing; and paragraphs 75 to 87 with residential accom-modation. Revenue and capital expenditure are dealt with in paragraphs 88 to93, which summarise in financial terms the growth in services envisaged by localauthorities; and paragraphs 94 to 97 draw together the manpower implications of their plans. Finally paragraphs 98 to 100 briefly state the progress made andthe development proposed, and indicate the action to be taken to follow up with local authorities any deficiencies which the plans appear to reveal.Domiciliary Staff44. Health Visitors. The present plans envisage the employment of 8,942health visitors (in whole-time equivalents) by the end of 1975, which would represent a ratio of 0-17 per 1,000 population. The first plans forecast a ratio of1-15 in 1972, and the first revised plans a ratio of 0-16 by the end of 1973. Thehigher ratios of 0-19 and 0-21 per 1,000 population forecast for English county boroughs and the Inner London boroughs respectively at the end of 1975,compared with the ratio of 0-16 for English county councils, may reflect thegreater pressures falling on health visitors in urban areas (although the differencebetween rural and urban areas is less marked in Wales); but there must remainsome doubt about the adequacy of the lower ratios to meet the needs of theservices.45. While the present returns show less variation than earlier plans in the forecasts for the end of 1975 among counties and county boroughs, the range of ratios of health visitors per 1,000 population is still considerable. In Englishcounties, for example, the range is from 0-09 to 0-24 ,and in English county boroughs rather greater; in Wales the ratios vary between 0-10 and 0-28.Local circumstances vary widely, but it seems questionable whether those author-ities with the lower ratios can be planning to provide an adequate service. It isencouraging that many authorities whose forecasts for the end of 1973 in thefirst revised plans were well below average have raised their sights and plan ahigher ratio of provision for the end of 1975.46. To meet the clear need for additional health visitors the Council forthe Training of Health Visitors estimate that it will be necessary to increase thenumber of health visitor students from 640 per annum to about 1,200 in thenext ten years. Revised health visitor training rules were approved in 1965, andthe Council are increasing the number of courses. At present there are 24approved training centres providing courses for the certificate and integratedcourses of nurse/health visitor training are available at five centres. Approval offurther courses is under consideration.47. Home Midwives. Local authorities forecast a total of 6,604 midwives (in whole-time equivalents) by the end of 1975, representing a ratio of 0-13 per1,000 population, compared with a ratio of 0-12 at the end of 1965. In the counties the 1975 ratios vary from 0-06 to 0-2, and in county boroughs from
0-04 to 0-26. In the London boroughs as a whole the corresponding ratio fore-cast is 0-09, and in the Inner London boroughs 0-07. This clearly reflects the high rate of hospital confinements in the London area, and illustrates the effect whichdifferences in local customs with regard to home or hospital confinementnecessarily have on the need for home midwives. It may well prove that a loweraverage ratio than 0-13 per 1,000 population will be adequate to meet the needsof the service in future years.48. Home Nurses. Local health authorities plan to expand the service to the equivalent of 9,839 home nurses (in whole-time equivalents), a ratio of 0-20 per1,000 population, by the end of 1970 and 10,609 (0-20) by the end of 1975.These figures represent not only an increase in the size of the total force but anincrease over the decade of just over 10 per cent in the ratio per 1,000 population(0-20 compared with 0-18 at the end of 1965).49. In English county boroughs and London boroughs the ratio planned for1975 varies within a range of 0-13 and 0-50 per 1,000 population, but individualforecasts are generally concentrated fairly close to the average (0-19). In Englishcounties the range is from 0-11 to 0-39 with a lower average (0-16). Welshauthorities plan to maintain the 1965 ratio (0-23), which is already well abovethe average for England, over the next ten years.50. The growing numbers of the elderly, and the growing proportion of their time which home nurses have to devote to the needs of the elderly, would suggestthat those authorities whose planned ratios are low will need to consider whether their assessment should be revised. There is some evidence in the present returnsthat authorities whose forecasts in earlier plans were substantially below thenational average have now raised their sights, but a minority apparently remaincontent to plan for a ratio which may well be too low.51. Home Helps. The present returns envisage an expansion in whole-timeequivalents from 30,005 at the end of 1965 to 44,330 at the end of 1975. In termsof ratios per 1,000 population these forecasts represent an improvement from-63 per 1,000 in 1965 to 0-85 in 1975. The returns show a wide variation in theextent of service planned for 1975 by individual authorities, from a ratio of1-24 per 1,000 population to 1-13 in English counties, 0-36 to 2-06 in Englishcounty boroughs, and 0-36 to 1 -77 in London boroughs. In Wales the range is from 0-48 to 2-03. A very satisfactory feature of the plans is the number of authorities who aim to provide home helps in 1975 in excess of 1-0 per 1,000population. These include eight English counties (and five Welsh), thirty-threeEnglish county boroughs (none in Wales) and thirteen London boroughs.52. Certain studies that have been undertaken, notably the report on theAged in the Welfare State by Townsend and Wedderburn, suggest that the homehelp service falls short of meeting all reasonable requirements. In September1964 the Minister sent a questionnaire to twenty local health authorities (tenwith a high ratio and ten with a low ratio of home helps per 1,000 population),the replies to which suggested that the size of the service provided is sometimesdetermined without full knowledge of the extent of local need. In Circular 25/65the Minister encouraged authorities to consider undertaking local studies toenable them to review realistically their services and plans. It will be surprisingif the results of any such studies suggest that a ratio of 1-0 home helps per1,000 population is likely to be too high by the end of 1975.
53. Social Workers. The local authorities&apos; forecast requirements for all categories of social workers at the end of 1970 and 1975 are 5,718 and 6,403respectively. These figures show that authorities&apos; current estimates are markedlyhigher than might have been expected from those made for the end of 1968(4,200) and 1973 (4,752) at the time of the first revised plans. This may reflectin part the encouraging recruitment figures mentioned in paragraph 18 which give grounds for hoping that authorities will be able to make substantial progress towards the achievement of these increased forecasts. In the present returns thenumbers of mental health social workers and other social workers have been shown separately; the national totals of these two categories of staff show that local authorities expect the need for mental health social workers to rise rather more quickly than that for other social workers. The total number of mentalhealth social workers is expected to rise from 1,606 at the end of 1965 to 2,625at the end of 1975 (an increase of about 64 per cent) whereas the number ofother social workers is expected to rise from 2,398 at the end of 1965 to 3,778at the end of 1975 (an increase of about 58 per cent). In 1965 about 16 per cent of all categories of social workers were qualified; it is encouraging that authoritiesare aiming at increasing this proportion to 52 per cent by 1975.54. The national ratio of mental health social workers per 1,000 population isexpected to rise from 0-03 per 1,000 population at the end of 1965 to 0-05 at theend of 1975, while for other social workers, the national ratio is expected torise from 0-05 at the end of 1965 to 0-07 at the end of 1975. Taking both types of social worker together the national ratios of 0-08 for 1965 and 0-12 for 1975are significantly higher than the comparable ratios forecast in the first revisedplans of 0-06 for 1963 and 0-09 for 1973. The ratios for individual authoritiesdo however reveal a wide range of variation. Several authorities are planning to achieve ratios for mental health social workers of over 0-13 by the end of1975; at the other end of the range several authorities are planning for ratiosof only 0-02 by the end of 1975. For other social workers several authoritiesare planning to achieve ratios over 0-24 by the end of 1975; at the lower endof the range several authorities plan ratios of only 0-02 by the end of 1975.The county boroughs and London boroughs tend to have higher ratios than thecounty councils. The Report of the Working Party on Social Workers in theLocal Authority Health and Welfare Services (the Younghusband Report)envisaged a ratio of 0-11 social workers per 1,000 population for 1972. Localauthorities&apos; present plans indicate that over the country as a whole they hope to achieve ratios in excess of 0-11 by the end of 1970 and 0-12 by the end of 1975.This is encouraging; but it must be admitted that, in view of the increasing needs for social workers revealed since 1959, if they were writing their report today theWorking Party might well have envisaged a ratio higher than 0-11. Certainly itseems clear that authorities aiming at ratios substantially lower than 0-12 bythe end of 1975 will need to reconsider their plans.55. The number of mental health social workers in training is expected to rise from 134 at the end of 1965 to 155 at the end of 1970 and 161 at the end of 1975;the number of other social workers in training is expected to rise from 354 at theend of 1965 to 484 at the end of 1970 and to fall to 462 at the end of 1975.These figures include not only staff on courses but also those whomauthorities intend to send on courses later; they do not include direct entrants to courses from outside local authority employment. Local authorities plan
to increase the number of staff holding the Certificate in Social Work from about 300 at the end of 1965 to about 2,400 at the end of 1975. It isnot possible to determine from the figures of those in training whetherthey will in fact secure this planned increase in certificated staff, and localauthorities will need to keep under review the numbers they have in trainingfrom time to time in the light of the actual increases in the number of qualifiedstaff being achieved. To meet training needs the Council for Training in social work has been increasing the number of courses for the CounciFs Certificates.The Council has already promoted, in England and Wales, 16 two-year coursesleading to the Certificate. More are planned, and some existing courses willsubstantially increase the numbers of students accepted annually, producing an estimated intake of at least 300 in 1966. In addition to these courses for new entrants and serving staff with relatively short experience, the Council has approved an emergency programme of one-year courses for those aged over 35with five or more years&apos; experience of social work. Four such courses are alreadyrunning and two more are expected to start later in 1966; these should providefor about 70 students. Other means are being sought to meet the special needsof serving officers who cannot take full-time training. Universities have increased the number of training places for students of social work and, as indicated inparagraph 18, there has been a substantial increase in the proportion of staffwith this type of qualification employed in the local authority services, particularlyin senior and supervisory posts.Ambulance Service56. Local authorities forecast a small increase in the number of ambulancestations, from 926 in March 1965 to 950 in March 1976; but this masks a con-tinuance of the policy of replacing small and unsuitable premises by largerpurpose-built units, as a result of which it is planned to build 65 additionalstations, to close 41, and to replace 187. This constitutes a substantial expansionof the previously planned development. The increase in ambulance vehicles is22 per cent over the ten-year period, slightly higher than the growth rateenvisaged in previous plans. By March 1965 the number of vehicles was 5,672,about the total expected by that date on the basis of the first revised plans. Thepresent plans also forecast a higher rate of growth in staff than either of theearlier plans. Authorities expect a staff of 16,481 by the end of 1970, comparedwith a total of 15,787 expected in the first revised plans by the end of 1973, anda figure of 17,651 by the end of 1975. Further increases may be necessary if therecommendations of the Working Party on training (published on 7th March,1966) are adopted following the consultations now in progress with the interests concerned, since they estimated that an increase of 3 per cent would be needed to allow for staff absent on training courses at any one time.57. While variations between different authorities in size and rate of planneddevelopment persist ranging from increases of 60 per cent in vehicles or staffor both to no increases at all the present returns show that authorities ingeneral are planning for increases nearer to the average rate than in earlierforecasts.
Centres and Clinics58. Health Centres. A striking feature of the present returns is the largenumber of additional health centres (that is premises which combined facilitiesfor general practitioner and for local authority services) forecast especiallyduring the earlier years. Compared with 68 envisaged by March 1974 in the firstrevised plans, 284 are now proposed by March, 1976, of which about half areforecast during the first two years of the present plans and about two-thirdsduring the first three years). Of particular interest is the fact that about a quarter of the health centres are proposed by the new London boroughs. Inview of the practical difficulties, notably the shortage and high cost of land inLondon, this initiative is greatly to be welcomed. The remaining centres pro-posed are divided evenly between the counties and county boroughs, withrather more in the former in the earlier years. It may be that the proposed new arrangements for direct payments to family doctors in respect of expenditureon rent and ancillary staff will lead to even greater expansion than the figuressuggest, and that family doctors and local authorities will come together topromote a more rapid development. There is a growing realisation among both parties that effective medical care in the community calls for their closest co-operation, and this can often best be achieved in health centres where the family doctor can enjoy the use of modern premises and daily contact with localauthority staff and facilities.59. Much has been learned from recent experiments about the desirable size and scope of health centres. To-day the tendency is to think in terms of smallerand more compact buildings than were at one time envisaged. Large centrescosting more than say,  150,000 are now generally acknowledged to beuneconomic and too ambitious for the needs of most areas. While a fewauthorities have provided in their plans for health centres costing over  100,000,the tendency in counties is to prefer centres costing about  40,000, and inboroughs about  60,000.60. Maternity and child welfare clinics. The proposals in the present plans toincrease the number of clinics from 6,452 in March, 1965 to 6,576 in March,1971 and 6,686 in March, 1976 represents a greater expansion than might havebeen expected from the forecasts of 6,487 in 1969 and 6,544 in 1974 contained inthe first revised plans. It may also represent an expansion calling for somereconsideration. The medical functions and staffing of child welfare centres areat present being reviewed by a sub-committee of the Standing Medical AdvisoryCommittee whose recommendations will be relevant to this question. If the best interests of the community demand closer integration of the local authority and family doctor services the continued provision of separate maternity and child welfare clinics may be undesirable. The future may indeed lie with the provisionof health centres, which may replace much of the present clinic programme.While not forgetting other purposes which may be served by these clinic premises(e.g. the welfare of the elderly), authorities may well think it prudent to lookagain at their proposals for the provision of new clinics.61. Training centres for the subnormal. The number of training centre places for children is planned in the present returns to rise from 18,770 in March, 1965to 27,061 in 1971 and 28,493 in 1976, representing respectively 0-39, 0-54 and0-54 places per 1,000 population. Places for adults are planned to rise from
15,348 in 1965 to 29,845 in 1971 and 33,971 in 1976, representing 0-32, 0-59 and0-65 places per 1,000 population.62. These national figures mask a very wide variation between the plans of individual authorities. The number of places for children per 1,000 population in 1965 range from 1-34 to nil, and the number planned for 1976 from 1-42 tonil. In 1965, 3 authorities had a ratio of 1-0 or more and another 53 of 0-5 ormore; in 1976, 7 plan to have 1-0 or more and another 111 authorities 0-5 ormore. Sixteen authorities&apos; plans show a ratio in 1976 no higher than the national average for 1965, and the national average for 1976 is less than half that of thehighest individual ratio for 1965.63. For adults, the 1965 ratios range from 1-08 to nil, and the 1976 ratiosfrom 1-66 to nil. In 1965, 2 authorities had a ratio of over 1-0 and another 40 of1-5 or more; for 1976, 20 plan over 1 -0 and another 108 authorities 0-5 or more.18 authorities&apos; plans show a ratio in 1976 no higher than the national average for 1965. The national average ratio for 1976 is lower than the provision already made in 1965 by 20 authorities.64. Each authority has made its own assessment of the number of placesneeded in its area, and the pace at which it can progress to that figure. The need is not necessarily the same in all areas, and the ratios shown for individual authorities take no account of the fact that some authorities provide some or all of the places needed by a neighbouring authority. It is not yet possible tosuggest what ratios are likely to meet the full need, which continues to grow as new techniques in training the subnormal are developed. Several researchstudies are in progress which are attempting to measure total needs and whichmay provide the necessary guidance. But it is clear from the wide variations inthe present and planned provision of individual authorities that for England andWales as a whole the plans up to 1976, while showing substantial improvementover the present provision, fall short of meeting the full need, particularly fortraining centres for adults.65. The number of training centre staff planned for December, 1970, and1975, would give ratios, in relation to places planned for March, 1971, and1976, of 1 to 9-7 and 1 to 9-4, compared with 1 to 9-6 in 1965. The TrainingCouncil for Teachers of the Mentally Handicapped has approved 16 courses which are expected to accommodate an intake of about 330 students in 1966,and others are under consideration. Authorities have been asked to release staff for training, and to make facilities available for students in their centres.66. Workshops or occupational centres for the mentally ill. The great majorityof the mentally ill either continue to work, or return to work, in open orsheltered employment, some of them passing through the Ministry of Labour&apos;industrial Rehabilitation Units or the workshops of the voluntary IndustrialTherapy Organisations. There is however some need for workshops or occupa-tional centres to be provided by local authorities for those who are temporarilyor permanently incapable of open or sheltered employment or (in the case ofwomen) of the management of their homes. This is still a new element in thelocal authority mental health services, and the extent of the need is likelyto become clearer as more centres are opened, and as more hostel places are provided for people who cannot return to their own homes on discharge frommental hospitals. In March, 1965, local health authorities had 659 places for the
mentally ill in 28 centres; some of these places are in centres which are also used by mentally subnormal adults or the physically handicapped. The plans providefor an increase by March, 1976 to 3,392 places in 106 centres.67. Social centres and clubs for the mentally disordered. These are planned toincrease, for the mentally ill, from 162 in March, 1965 to 282 in March 1976;and for the subnormal from 142 in 1965 to 230 in 1976. This is in addition toclubs run by voluntary societies. This is an activity in which there is great scope for co-operation between local authorities and voluntary societies, particularly where the authorities can make premises available for a club which a voluntarysociety may be able to organise. There is also scope for collaboration with the hospitals, in areas where hospital patients can attend a club run by a localauthority or voluntary society in the community, or where people living in thecommunity can attend social activities in near-by hospitals.68. Centres for the physically handicapped. The present plans envisage a more rapid and extensive development than before, from 1,384 centres in March,1965 to 1,605 in 1971 and 1,702 in 1976, compared with forecasts of 1,473 in1969 and 1,561 in 1974 in the first revised plans. These centres vary considerably in size and quality, but the trend is toward the provision of larger purpose-builtpremises with a wide range of functions. At present there are only about 50purpose-built centres, but the experience gained in operating smaller centres isa valuable guide to the type of facilities most needed in each district. Englishauthorities propose to provide 250 more purpose-built centres by 1976, 195 ofthem by 1971. The London boroughs with very few at present have plans for 69additional centres.69. The plans for the large scale development of centres for the physicallyhandicapped entail a considerable expansion of specialised staff. Authoritieshave not, however, recruited as many occupational therapists for these andother services as they had previously estimated (208 in all at the end of 1965compared with a forecast of 266 in the first revised plans); and they may find difficulty in recruiting sufficient numbers from this small profession to achieve their objective of doubling the numbers employed to 416 by 1969. The majorstaffing requirement for centres is however for craft instructors. 302 were em-ployed at the end of 1965; plans envisage an expansion to 740 by 1975. But the type of staff employed in each centre must vary according to the activitiesprovided, and as voluntary bodies run some centres completely and are res-ponsible for certain activities at others, the estimates of directly employed staffdo not constitute a complete picture of the available manpower.70. Centres for the elderly. Whatever may be the range of facilities provided the development of centres is clearly seen by local authorities as a substantial contribution towards the objective of helping the old person to maintain anindependent life in his own home as long as possible. According to the present&apos; returns 115 centres were provided by authorities in March 1965, and the numbersforecast for 1971 and 1976 are 308 and 429 respectively. These figures vary ap-preciably from earlier plans, and the change no doubt reflects a revision in thelight of growing experience of the nature and proper function of a centreproperly so-called. It is likely that plans will again be revised as further know-ledge is gained of the role of the centre in a comprehensive service for the elderly.
71. Housing of the Elderly. In the future as now the overwhelming majorityof old people will live in their own or other private households, assisted and supported as may be necessary by the community services already described in earlier paragraphs. Housing authorities have made a substantial contributionto the housing of the elderly, not only through the general housing programmebut especially by providing since the war some 360,000 dwellings with onebedroom (or bed-sitting rooms), most of which are occupied by the elderly and indeed were designed with their needs particularly in mind. A total of about410,000 of these dwellings is available.72. Special housing. For old people needing some degree of daily help and support, there has been the developement of &quot;special housing&quot;, that is ofgrouped dwellings under the supervision of a warden who can give or arrange for practical help. Housing authorities provide the accommodation which does not formally constitute a part of the welfare services or of the capital and revenue expenditure forecast in the present plans. But the welfare authority is closely associated with such schemes, and often also plays a part in the selection of tenants. Information about special housing covering the six years 1963-9 was first obtained as part of the first revised plans of local authorities. These showed that 35,894 old people were accommodated at the end of March, 1963, a ratio of 6-4 per thousand of the population aged 65 and over, and that authoritiesforecast a total of 123,961 (a ratio of 20 per thousand) by March, 1969. Thepresent returns, again covering a six year period, show that by the end of March,1965, 63,541 persons had been provided for a ratio of 10-9 and that by theend of March, 1971, it is proposed to provide for 159,228 persons, a ratio of24-6. There is clear evidence of the rapid development of this form of housing.73. The amount of special housing provided or planned varies widely indifferent areas. Four counties, 20 county boroughs and five London boroughshad no special housing in 1965; seven county boroughs and two London boroughsshow no provision by 1971. At the other end of the scale, the highest ratios per thousand elderly people in 1965 in counties were 69-3, in county boroughs 42-and in London boroughs 19-0; and the highest ratios planned for 1971 are incounties 102-5, in county boroughs 118-0 and in London boroughs 24-1. Ingeneral the tendency appears to be for special housing to be provided more widely (and residential homes less widely) in the counties, and the reverse inthe boroughs.74. Local circumstances are very different, and firm evidence is not yet available to show what scale of provision is most likely to be needed. But theremay in some areas be a view that special housing constitutes an alternative to residential homes. This is certainly not so where there is an established needfor continuous care and attention. It is generally more likely that the two services are complementary and are required to meet the needs of differentgroups of old people. In any event it is clear that the need for special housing islarge and will grow with the growing numbers of old people, and that authoritiesplanning for only a low ratio per thousand (or none at all) will need to reconsider their plans.
Residential accommodationThe mentally ill or subnormal75. General. Hostels are not the only way of providing residential accom-modation for the mentally disordered. Placement in lodgings, privately withfamilies, or in small self-supporting groups in ordinary houses, are alternative,and for some far preferable, methods. The aim should be to enable each person to live as socially normal a life as possible. But taking this fully into account, aswell as continuing placement in residential homes run by voluntary societies or private persons, there can be no doubt that a great many hostels provided andstaffed by the local authorities themselves will be needed, as part of a fully developed system of community care.16. It is also important that local health authorities&apos; plans for hostels andtraining or occupational centres should be co-ordinated. Although someresidents in the hostels will be in open or sheltered employment, and many ofthose attending the centres will be living with their own families, there are many who need both hostel accommodation and a place in a centre and for whom one is no good without the other. This is particularly important for those who canbe discharged from hospital if, but only if, a comprehensive service is availablein the community.77. Subnormal adults. The number of hostel places for subnormal adults areplanned to increase from 1,446 in March, 1965 to 8,854 in 1976, representingrespectively ratios of 0-03 and 0-17 places per 1,000 population. In March, 1965123 of the 174 local health authorities had no such hostels. Among the other 51authorities, provision ranged from 0-33 to 0-01 places per 1,000 population.The plans for 1976 show 40 authorities still without any hostels, and provisionby the others ranging from 0-69 to 0-03 places per 1,000 population. Subnormaladults are the group among the mentally disordered for whom the greatestnumber of hostels are needed. The present plans are a step in the right direction,but only a step. Many authorities will need to move both further and faster than their present plans provide.78. Subnormal children. In March, 1965, there were 900 places in localauthority hostels for subnormal children, which are planned to increase to2,706 in 1976, representing ratios of 0-02 and 0-05 per 1,000 population. 40 ofthe 174 authorities provided hostels in 1965; 85 plan to do so in 1976. The ratiosrange from 0-18 to nil in 1965 and from 0-28 to nil in 1976. The amount of residential accommodation needed for subnormal children is likely to vary considerably from one area to another, depending partly on the distribution of population and ease of travel, partly on housing and other social conditions,and partly on arrangements between authorities for shared accommodation.The main reasons why such accommodation is needed are to enable children toattend training centres because their homes are too far away for daily travel, orto provide for children whose families are unable to look after them properly athome.79. Mentally ill. The number of places in hostels for the mentally ill is planned to increase from 831 in March, 1965, to 4,966 in 1976, representingratios of 0-02 and 0 09 places per 1,000 population. Local health authorities areat present only beginning to gain experience in the provision of such hostels,which are largely in the experimental stage. Future plans are likely to be muchaffected by the lessons to be learnt from the pioneers about such questions as
the selection-of residents, the likely average length of stay, staffing and other considerations. The Ministry is at present engaged in a study of these hostels,and it is hoped in due course to be in a position to give guidance to authoritiesbased on the knowledge so far acquired of their nature and use.The physically handicapped80. In the past it has been common for the physically handicapped of all agesto be housed together, and for the elderly without specific handicap to be housedwith the elderly who are physically handicapped. This practice continues; andthe present returns show that homes for the elderly provided 5,465 places for persons under 65 in March, 1965, and that homes for the physically handicappedprovided 4,155 places for persons of 65 and over and 2,916 places for those under65. The forecast figures for 1971 and 1976 show no departure from this pattern;and although it is not possible from the forecasts to determine how far thefigures mask a change from mixed to separate accommodation, it is evidentfrom the more detailed information about capital projects supplied with thepresent returns that some authorities are unfortunately still thinking in terms ofall-purpose homes, and that even by 1976 the majority of the younger handi-capped (an even greater number than at present) would still be accomodated in homes for the elderly. Many authorities will need to review their present plans in order to provide the small homes of not more than 35 places which arerequired to meet the needs of the younger handicapped. Fortunately there areproposals for 50 such homes, including 14 in London where there is a markedshortage of purpose-built accommodation.The elderly81. Residential homes for those in need of care and attention, particularly the elderly, constitute not only a major welfare responsibility of local authoritiesbut also the major single item of capital expenditure for their health and welfare services. Indeed the capital programmes forecast for the next ten years devotenearly half the total, or  171 million, to this one purpose.82. The reason for this programme is clear, namely the great and growingnumbers of elderly persons. The following table shows the expected increases in the elderly population of England and Wales over the decade covered bythese returns:Table 4.Estimated Numbers of elderly people by age groupsThousandsAge Group	1965			T971			1976			Men	Women	Total	Men	Women	Total	Men	Women	Total65-74 75-84 85 and over	1,505 598 100	2,217 1,157 252	3,722 1,755 352	1,799 630 98	2,424 1,251 264	4,223 1,881 362	1,979 715 102	2,578 1,355 288	4,557 2,070 390	2,203	3,626	5,829	2,527	3,939	II 6,466 1 2,796		4.221	7,017
Present experience suggests that the age of admission to homes tends to be high,and that it is particularly among those aged 75 or over that the need forresidence arises. As the table shows, it is estimated that the numbers in this age group will increase by 17 per cent between 1965 and 1976.83. The present returns forecast substantial increases in the number of places for the elderly in residential homes over the ten-year period. At the end ofMarch, 1965,90,995 places were provided, a ratio of 15-6 per thousand aged 65and over. The total rises to 130,256 (20-2) in 1971, and 151,994 (21-7) in 1976.These figures compare with ratios of 15-3 in 1964 and 18-9 in 1974 forecast inthe first revised plans. The increase over the eleven years ending in March, 1976. is one of more than 65 per cent compared with an increase of 17 per cent in thepopulation aged 75 or over, and the difference provides some measure of thecurrent shortfall in residential accommodation for the elderly.84. The increase in places forecast is a net increase, since authorities are planning also for the replacement of old and outworn accommodation. TheMinister asked authorities in preparing the present plans to state their intentionswith regard to the closure of former public assistance institutions including atime-table of action. It is a notable achievement that the number of residents inthese unsuitable buildings taken over for the purpose in 1948 has already beenreduced from 42,000 to 27,000; but it is rarely possible to provide in themaccommodation and care of modern standards, and their final elimination shouldbe achieved as soon as possible. Authorities&apos; present plans provide for all but30, with 3,000 places, to be closed by 1976, and two of the remainder to be closedin 1977 and 1978. In some instances there is reluctance to close premises wherelarge sums have been or are to be spent on improvements. This reluctance isunderstandable; but while it must be right to improve even obsolescent premisesto make living in them more acceptable, expenditure on improvements cannotbe held to consitute a justification for delaying closure. Only very exceptionallycan these premises be modernised to produce a home acceptable by currentstandards. Local authorities which are not planning for early closure will need toconsider their plans again.85. Both present numbers of places for the elderly in residential homes andplanned increases vary substantially between different areas. In March, 1965 thehighest ratio of places per thousand of the population aged 65 and over was for an individual authority in counties 27-8, in county boroughs 32-1 and inLondon boroughs 30-7. The corresponding highest forecasts for 1976 are 35-339-9 and 47-5. At the other end of the scale the lowest existing ratio in the counties was 10-1, in county boroughs 7-6 and in London boroughs 6-1, andthe lowest ratio forecast for 1976 is 11 -1 in the counties, 13-4 in county boroughs and 13-1 in London boroughs. Following the production of the first revisedplans authorities planning for a ratio of less than 15 were asked to review their forecasts, and it appears that they have generally concluded that a figurebelow 15 is not adequate.86. Knowledge is still too limited to enable standard ratios of places topopulation to be laid down, and local conditions must in any event call for different levels. An important factor is that relationship between the hospital and welfare services in providing residential care, and in September 1965 theMinister sent to local and hospital authorities a memorandum outlining the
division of function as it appears to him and asking for close co-operationbetween them both in planning and in policies for admission. Co-operation ofthis kind is an essential basis for the proper development of an integrated service for the elderly, and as it grows its effect may be reflected in future planning.Further research now in progress, such as that being undertaken with theMinisters assistance into the circumstances of old people by the NationalCorporation for the Care of Old People and by the National Institute for social work Training, should also throw clearer light on the need for residential homes.Meanwhile experience so far would suggest that most authorities may find aTatio of between 15 and 25 places per thousand population aged 65 and overappropriate to their areas.87. The staffing of residential homes may well present increasing problems.Authorities forecast a residential care staff of 26,622 at the end of 1975, anincrease of some 11,000 over 1965. It is likely that in doing so they assumed a continuance of broadly the same standards of staffing as at present. It is ex-pected that the Committee on the Staffing of Residential Homes and Institutions,appointed by the National Council of Social Service under the chairmanship ofLady Williams, will shortly provide valuable advice on the problems of recruit-ment, training and staffing generally in old people&apos;s homes as well as in otherresidential institutions of the health and welfare services.Expenditure88. Revenue Expenditure. The revenue expenditure forecast in the presentten-year plans at June 1965 prices is shown below.Table 5.  millionNet Revenue Expenditure* (at June, 1965 prices)Year	Health	Welfare	Total1965/66	112	42	1541966/67	122	46	1681967/68	128	50	1781968/69	136	55	1911969/70	143	59	2021970/71	148	63	2111975/76	167	77	244These figures are net, after taking account of estimated payments by recipients of theservices.89. The expenditure which authorities will actually incur in each of theyears covered by their plans will be affected by the amount of capital employed,the staff available and the decisions taken in framing their annual budgets. Itis difficult for authorities to estimate these with precision more than a year ortwo ahead. The forecasts of expenditure can however reasonably be regardedas a general indication of the extent to which local authorities are planning todevelop their health and welfare services.90. The figures imply a considerable expansion of health and welfare servicesover the ten years covered by the plans, a growth of 58 per cent in all; the annual
rate of increase is 9 per cent in 1966/67, falling off in later years to an average ofabout 3 per cent a year in the five years 1971/72 to 1975/76. The estimated increase in expenditure in 1966/67 is considerably greater than has been achieved in the past and may not be wholly realistic; but the average of about 6\ per cent per annum for the period 1965/66 to 1970/71 is more likely to be achieved.Within this figure, the average annual increase in expenditure on local health services is expected to be about 6 per cent, and that on welfare services about8J per cent. The falling off in the estimated increase in health and welfare services expenditure in the later years no doubt reflects the difficulties of fore-casting realistically so far ahead.91. Table 20.2 of the National Plan (Cmnd. 2764) includes estimates of current expenditure by local authorities on health and welfare services in GreatBritain. These are compiled on a different basis from the forecasts of net revenue expenditure in the present local authority plans in that they are before deduction of income from charges to recipients of the services, do not include capitalexpenditure met from revenue, and are at 1965 Survey prices. After makingadjustments to allow for these differences, the net revenue expenditure on local health and welfare services in England and Wales implicit in the National Planshows an increase of about 30 per cent between 1965-66 and 1969-70. Thecorresponding increase in net revenue expenditure shown by the present localauthority plans (31 per cent) is not significantly higher, but starts with a slightly higher level of estimated expenditure in 1965-66 than is allowed for in theNational Plan. The division of net revenue expenditure implicit in the national plan between local health and welfare services in 1969-70 is broadly similar tothat in the ten-year plans.92. Capital Expenditure. As was the case in local authorities&apos; first planspublished in 1963 and the first revised plans published in 1964, the present plans show that authorities forecast that the greater part ( 256 million or 74per cent) of the capital expenditure over the 10 years 1966-67 to 1975-76 will be concentrated into the first five years (1966-67 to 1970-71) (see page 413). Inpractice, experience has shown that capital expenditure is likely to be more evenlydistributed over the whole 10 year period. While the annual amounts of loansanction recommended for health and welfare capital expenditure must alwaysdepend on the national economic circumstances, it is intended over the years toincrease the amount in real terms of loan sanctions recommended. This isimplicit in the figures for capital expenditure on local health and welfare services included in the National Plan; and those figures are likely to be more realistic than the present forecasts of local authorities. To an appreciable extent the speed of implementation of the authorities&apos; capital programmes rests with theauthorities themselves. Experience has shown the need to go ahead with the detailed planning of individual schemes (including obtaining sites) well inadvance of the application for loan sanction.93. To sum up the position on the expenditure forecasts in the present plans,the National Plan implied that the proportion of the total current and capitalexpenditure of local authorities in England and Wales devoted to local health services was about 3J per cent in 1964-65, and was expected to rise to nearly  per cent in 1969-70. For welfare services, the proportion was must over II percent in 1964-65, rising to nearly 2 per cent in 1969-70. Similarly, the proportionof total public expenditure incurred on local health and welfare services (about
If per cent) is expected to show an increase of about a tenth in the period. As is mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, the rate of increase in net revenue and capital expenditure on health and welfare services shown in the present localauthority plans is in line with the National Plan, after allowing for a more evenspread of capital expenditure over the years.Manpower94. In paragraphs 44-55 reference has been made to the needs for staff for thedomiciliary services, in paragraph 56 for the ambulance service, in paragraph 69for the various types of centres, and in paragraph 87 for residential homes for the elderly. But the staff required for the local authority health and welfare servicesincludes many other categories not so far mentioned for example, doctors,dentists, nursery nurses, chiropodists, as well as large numbers of administrative,manual and domestic staff. The present returns show a total for all types ofstaff of 133,048 at the end of 1965.95. In preparing the forecasts for the next ten years local authorities were asked to indicate for the years 1966, 1967 and 1968 only the numbers they expected to be able to recruit and to have in post; but for later years to assume that staff would be obtainable, and to indicate on that basis the numbers they expected to need and would be prepared to employ. The forecasts show anincrease from 1965 to the end of 1968 of 28,567, or over 21 per cent; for thefirst five years to the end of 1970 an increase of 43,802, or nearly 33 per cent;and for the second five years to the end of 1975 a further increase of 22,696 or about 13 per cent over the 1970 total.96. These estimates are substantially higher in total than those made in thefirst revised plans, though as suggested for example in relation to health visitors(paragraph 44), home nurses, (paragraph 50), home helps (paragraph 52), and social workers (paragraph 54), it may well be that some authorities have under-estimated the need for some groups of staff. On the other hand there may alsobe overestimates, for example of home midwives (paragraph 47), and of staff for centres, clinics and residential accommodation generally. If capital develop-ment, on which about half the estimated increase depends, proceeds less rapidly than forecast in the local authorities plans and this is the expectation indicatedin paragraph 92 above the staff estimates particularly for the earlier years maywell prove too high.97. Account must also be taken of the probable general shortage of man-power, to which attention was drawn in the National Plan, bringing with itkeen competition for the limited resources available. In February last (Circular4/66) authorities were asked to keep staff increases to the minimum compatible with the achievement of essential improvements in services; and even with the wider employment of part-time staff (particularly of married women) whichauthorities will need to extend in the greatest possible measure, the generallabour shortage may necessitate the continuance of this course. Authorities willalso need to keep their priorities for the recruitment of staff under close review,in order to ensure that the resources obtainable are devoted particularly to those services where the shortage is greatest.
CONCLUSION98. Paragraphs 10 to 39 have described the notable progress already made bylocal authorities towards realising the plans they first prepared in 1962. the degree of development inevitably varies from service to service and from area to area, but in general the achievement is substantial. Measured by revenue expenditure at constant prices the growth by 1964-65 was of the order of 12per cent above the level of 1962-63.99. Together with the summaries of the plans themselves paragraphs 43 to97 demonstrate the general resolve of local authorities to devote steadily in-creasing resources to the development of services essential to the well-being ofthe communities for whom they are responsible. Again measured by revenue expenditure at constant prices, the growth envisaged between 1965-66 and1975-76 is of the order of 58 per cent. Attainment of this objective must dependin large measure on the national resources in money and manpower which canbe made available, but the plans bear witness to the readiness of local authorities as a whole to do all in their power to achieve success.100. It will, however, be apparent from the foregoing paragraphs and fromthe plans of individual authorities that the level of particular services providedby a small minority of them falls below what is acceptable, and that some ofthese authorities do not appear to be planning to improve unsatisfactoryservices to an acceptable standard over the next ten years. In some areas thefigures may well obscure the true position for example where a satisfactoryservice is being provided by a voluntary body, or where facilities provided byone authority are meeting the needs of an adjoining area. But where the pro-vision of a service appears to be substantially below an adequate level and likelyto remain so over the whole period of the present plans, the Minister proposesto arrange for his officers to discuss the position with the authority concernedwith a view to action to remedy any deficiency. It is his strong wish to work as rapidly as possible towards a situation in which an acceptable standard ofservice is provided throughout England and Wales; and he is confident that allauthorities will share that wish, and will be ready to co-operate in reaching thatobjective.
APPENDIX ASUMMARIES OFLOCAL AUTHORITIES&apos; PLANS
GENERAL NOTES1. The authorities are arranged by Hospital Regions, as nearly as possible inthe same sequence as in the Hospital Plan for England and Wales (Cmnd. 0000),Appendix A, in order to facilitate comparison with the Hospital Programme.The Hospital Regions and local authority areas are in many places not exactlyco-terminous, and where a local authority area falls in more than one HospitalRegion, it is placed under the Region in which the largest part of its populationlives.2. The population estimates for 1965 are the Registrar General&apos;s mid-yearestimates of the home population of each area.The population projections for mid-1971 and mid-1976 are sub-divisions ofthe projections for standard regions made by the General Register Office for theNational Plan (Cmnd. 2764). Those projections were made for 1971 and 1981,so that regional projections for 1976 were obtained by interpolation.Within the standard regions, it has been assumed that the change which occurred between 1951 and 1964 in the proportion of home population residing in each local authority area will continue at the same rate. Thus if a particularlocal authority area had 5-00% of a standard region&apos;s population in 1951 and5-13% in 1964 an increase of 0-01 % a year would be projected forward, giving5-20% in 1971 and 5-25% in 1976.The estimates for persons aged 65 and over were done in the same way asthose for persons of all ages, though rather more estimation was involved inobtaining starting data and regional controls for persons aged 65 and over.The method used continues forward any trends occurring between 1951 and1964 in the distribution of population within a standard region, and makes no allowance for changes in trends of housing development and population move-ments within those regions. These estimates are the best available consistentprojections for local authorities in England and Wales as a whole at the time of going to print, and are subject to revision in the light of further assessment bythe General Register Office.3. Premises, places and services include those provided under agency arrange-ments (except for centres for the elderly) and those provided in rented accom-modation. Residential accommodation provided on behalf of local authorities by voluntary organisations for the elderly, for the physically handicapped andfor the mentally handicapped is included in the figures of places but not of premises. Only premises in use, or expected to be in use, at the given dates are shown. Total numbers of available places are shown, not merely occupiedplaces.4. Multi-purpose premises are shown in Table 1(a) under each kind of provision and places are apportioned. For example a mixed training centre with20 junior places and 30 adult places would be counted as follows: Premises     PlacesJunior Training Centre    .. 1 20Adult Training Centre     .. 1 30The figures of premises are, therefore, to some extent inflated.
5. Social centres and clubs for the mentally subnormal, for which numbers are shown at the end of Table 1(a), are usually held in premises providedprimarily for another purpose, e.g. training centre.6. For homes for the elderly separate figures for persons aged 65 and overand persons aged under 65 are shown in Table 1(a) in order to give some indication of the extent to which places in homes for the elderly are used foryounger people. Similarly figures for places in homes for the handicapped showseparately the number of places filled by persons aged 65 and over. Table 1(c)relates only to those places in homes for the elderly and for the physicallyhandicapped which are occupied by persons aged 65 and over.7. The physically handicapped include the blind and the deaf.8. The figures of special housing for the elderly in Table 1(d) show thenumber of persons accommodated in special housing where there is a residentwarden, or where staff employed in a near-by residential home for the elderlyare on call. The plans do not include forecasts beyond 1971. Accommodationprovided by Housing Societies is included in addition to local authority provision.9. The figures of staff exclude the staff of the school health service. Students,pupils and full-time administrative and supervisory nursing staff are excludedfrom the separate figures of midwives, health visitors and home nurses, but staff who are partly administrative or supervisory are included in those separatefigures. The ambulance staff figures include senior operational staff. The figuresof day nursery staff include all administrative and supervisory staff but studentsare excluded. For staff engaged in more than one branch of domiciliary work,hours of work have been divided among the entries in the Tables as appropriate.The forecast figures show the numbers the authorities consider they will needand will be prepared to employ, but limited as regards 31st December 1966,31st December 1967 and 31st December 1968 to the numbers they expect to beable to recruit.10. Social workers include all engaged in social work in the health and welfare services: medical social workers, family case workers, home teachers of the blind, mental welfare officers, moral welfare officers, psychiatric social workers,welfare officers and welfare officers for the deaf. Staff appointed with a view to training for a qualification in social work are included under &quot;welfare assis-tants&quot;11. Ambulances include sitting-case cars and dual purpose vehicles. Vehiclesused for the Hospital Car Service are not included.
