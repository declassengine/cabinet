ANNUAL REVIEW AND DETERMINATION of guarantees 1966I. Implementing the National Plan1. When the National Plan (Cmnd. 2764) was published, in September1965, the Government announced that the programme for agriculture would,like other parts of the Plan, be kept under constant review to measure theprogress that was being achieved and to assess the resources required. TheGovernment and the Farmers&apos; Unions agreed that the Annual Reviews underthe Agriculture Acts of 1947 and 1957 should be used for this purposedThe Government made it clear that in determining guaranteed prices and production grants at future Annual Reviews they would take account ofthe objectives set for agriculture in the Plan, as well as of all other relevant factors.2. These objectives are that agriculture should save imports of food thatwould otherwise be necessary to meet increasing demand, and release man-power to other sectors of the economy. The Government therefore wish tosee a further selective expansion of agriculture, provided that this is basedupon the maintenance of the rate of increase in the industry&apos;s productivity.3. No definite production targets have been set, because the desirablerate of expansion of different products will depend on a number of factors:the technical limitations on increasing output, the development of inter-national commercial relations, the call that expansion might make uponscarce real resources and upon Government expenditure, and the progress made in increasing productivity. But the agricultural industry should be ableto meet a major part of the additional demand expected by 1970, totalling about  200 million,! for food which can be grown in this country. Par-ticular emphasis is placed on the expansion of meat production, especially of beef. Since two-thirds of our home-produced beef comes from the dairy herd, this will require an increase in the dairy as well as the beef herd, andthus inevitably give rise to an increase in milk production. It will also meanan increased demand for cereal feed, a substantial part of which will need tobe produced at home.4. The Government have recognised that the industry will need to havethe physical and financial resources required to carry out the selective expansion programme and at the same time to achieve a further increasein productivity. This increased productivity is essential if the industry is to fulfil the objectives of continuing to release manpower and of minimisingits call on the Exchequer for support.5. The programme will require increased investment by the industry, inthe form both of working capital and of fixed assets. The desired expansionof output represents annual rates of increase in net output and release of* The progress of the horticultural industry is being kept under review at thebiennial examinations held in consultation with the Farmers&apos; Unions: see &quot; Examinationof the Horticultural Industry 1965&quot;, published by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office on,9th March 1966.t At 1964 import prices.
manpower broadly similar to those achieved in the last few years ; the required increase in investment will be of the same order as in recent yearsand should therefore be within the industry&apos;s capacity. The Governmentare taking action which will help the industry to obtain the resources needed.The arrangements for guaranteeing bank loans, already available to horticulture-ture, have been extended to agriculture. The maintenance and the increaseof investment in fixed assets will be helped by the plans for continuing and extending the Farm Improvement Scheme which form part of the Govern-menfs proposals for the development of agriculture, and for which anadditional  80 million is to be provided. The new investment incentives inagriculture, which the Government are introducing in place of investmentallowances, are also designed to encourage investment in plant, machinery and equipment which will promote productivity and save manpower.6. The production objectives of the Plan have been among the main considerations affecting the determinations at this Review. But the deter-determinations also give effect to the principles of the Agriculture Acts of 1947and 1957 to promote and maintain a stable and efficient agricultural industry, capable of producing the output desired at minimum prices con-sistently with proper remuneration and living conditions and an adequatereturn on capital. These principles and the objectives of the Plan com-complement each other. The Government recognise that a stable and efficientindustry which is carrying out the seleotive expansion programme on thebasis of a continued rise in productivity, deserves a fair return for itsendeavours ; and the determinations have been made accordingly. TheGovernment have had in mind the assurance they have given to the Farmers&apos;Unions, that the full-time commercial farmer who is operating at a satis-factory level of productivity should be able to earn a proper remuneration,and to improve his income, and so his standard of living, through increasingthat productivity; and they have given a further assurance on this matter(paragraph 64).7. The Government have considered the course of production in relationto the overall rate of expansion envisaged in the Plan and to the selective expansion programme for different commodities. They have also takenfull account of the statements on individual commodities which they made when the Plan was published. Agricultural net output continues to increase,although the forecast increase in 1965/66 is rather below the average ofrecent years because of the weather. The beef breeding herd is expandingbut this expansion has been confined to the hill areas. The dairy herd,which fell between 1962 and 1964, has partly recovered and is now increasingslowly. The Government&apos; announced last September that they intended atleast to maintain the guaranteed price of beef at its existing level for the1966 and two subsequent Annual Reviews, provided that there was no significant change in circumstances. They also undertook to examine jointly with the Farmers&apos; Unions means of overcoming the problems involved in increasing the beef herd. On milk, the Government undertook that in deter-mining the standard quantities they would take account of their talks withthe industry on milk production levels and requirements, and also of the contribution which an expanded dairy herd could make to extra beef production.
8. In the light of all these considerations the Government have concluded that the main need at this year&apos;s Annual Review is to give some furtherstimulus to the production of beef from both the beef and dairy herds. Theyhave decided to increase the guaranteed price for fat cattle (paragraph 27) andto introduce a beef cow subsidy to encourage beef production in those ares which do not qualify for the hill cow subsidy (paragraphs 27 and 55). Theyhave also decided to increase the standard quantities and the guaranteed price for milk (paragraph 28).9. In order to provide a situation favourable to an expansion of beef production over the next few years the Government give an assurance that,provided there is no significant change in circumstances, they will not reduceat any of the Reviews within the period of the present Plan either the guaranteed price for beef cattle or the rate of the beef cow subsidy as determined at this Review. The Government also recognise that if the dairy herd is expanded to meet the need for increased beef production, andthe increased milk production due to this expansion of the herd has to be sold for purposes other than liquid consumption, this could result in adilution of the pool price and they give an assurance that they will take these facts into account in the determinations on milk at future Reviewswithin the period of the present Plan. Further discussions on this assuranceon milk will be held with the Farmers&apos; Unions during the year.10. On cereals, the Government announced last September that becauseof the expected increase in demand for cereal feed the standard quantities for wheat and barley would not be reduced below existing levels at the 1966 andtwo subsequent Annual Reviews but would be related to the expected growth in the market. More cereals are being used for feed and the Governmenthave decided to increase the standard quantities for wheat and barley (para-graph 49). For pigs, sheep and potatoes, moderate encouragement is needed in order to meet the production objectives, while for eggs there is need forrestraint to avoid the risk of production outrunning demand. In the deter-determinations the level of the guarantees for these commodities has been adjustedaccordingly.11. To help in assessing the progress of the selective expansion programme,the resources required by the industry and, in particular, the level of itsremuneration, the economic and financial data available at the Annual Reviewmust be made as comprehensive and up-to-date as possible. The Governmenthave therefore carried out jointly with the Farmers&apos; Unions a thorough exami-nation of the data. They have agreed that information should be provided on the physical and financial assets which are being employed for currentfarming purposes, i.e. the value of occupiers&apos; capital; and also that furtherinformation should be presented on the trends of net income and profitability of full-time farm businesses, in total and for the different categories and sizesof business. This year, and in future, the annual report on &quot; Farm Incomes inEngland and Wales &quot;*, which gives information collected by UniversityDepartments of Agricultural Economics from farm accounts, will be published at the same time as the Annual Review White Paper. Corresponding informa-tion for Scotland and Northern Ireland will be published each spring in* Published by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office (price 10s. 0d.).
&quot; Scottish Agricultural Economics &quot; and in the &quot; Statistical Review of Farmingin Northern Ireland &quot;. This information on incomes of different types andsizes of farms relates to the farming year preceding the year under considera-tion at the Annual Review, and the Government will examine whether the trend of income for the various types and sizes of farms could be assessedfor the Annual Review year. The various changes indicated in this paragraphwill necessarily take time to complete, and meanwhile much of the new datawill be of a provisional character.12. Since the 1965 Annual Review new information has become available on the structure of the industry which underlines the need, recognised at the1965 Annual Review, to adapt support measures to meet the special problems and requirements of the different sectors of the industry. In the White paper on that Review (Cmnd. 2621) the Government drew attention to the complex and heterogeneous nature of the industry, and pointed out that most of itsoutput was produced by about a quarter of the total of 450,000 agricultural holdings. As a result of a special survey it has now been established thatthere are some 220,000 full-time farms in the United Kingdom. Of these,about 112,000 are small scale farms (with fewer than 600 standard man-days). About 66,000 are small &quot; commercial&quot; businesses (between 600 and1,200 standard man-days). The remaining 42,000 are large &quot; commercial&quot;farm businesses (over 1,200 standard man-days) and this group produces about half of the industry&apos;s total output. It is also estimated that the number of full-time farms in the United Kingdom is falling at a rate of between two andthree thousand a year.13.,New information is also available about the value to the industry ofthe annual gain in its efficiency. This was last assessed in 1960, when thefigure of  25 million a year for Review commodities then agreed with the farmers&apos; Unions was related to the level of the industry&apos;s output in the mid-1950s. Since then the volume of output has increased substantially. Ithas now been agreed with the Farmers&apos; Unions to adopt for Annual Reviewpurposes a revised figure of  30 million for Review commodities as an indication of the annual rate of gain in agricultural efficiency.14. At this Review the Government have made their first assessment ofthe industry&apos;s progress towards the objectives of the Plan and of the resourcesit needs. But the determinations which have been made in the light of thisassessment must also be considered along with other Government measuresto increase the productivity of the industry. The Government^ long-term proposals for the development of agriculture include improvements in the marketing of meat and livestock which, together with those already agreed with the Farmers&apos; Unions in the support and marketing arrangements forpotatoes and eggs, will bring about a substantial advance in the marketing of farm produce. Besides the provisions already mentioned for credit facilities and for continuing and extending the Farm Improvement Scheme, the Govern-menfs long-term proposals also provide for schemes to improve the size and lay-out of farms, to assist rural development in the hills and uplands,and to encourage co-operative activities among farmers. It is not intended that these schemes, apart from those for co-operation and credit, should betreated as relevant production grants for the purposes of the Agriculture Act
1957 and their cost will therefore not be included within the value of the guarantees. Nevertheless they represent a part of the contribution whichthe Government will be making towards the development of agriculture inthe coming years. The Review determinations should therefore be seen aspart of a comprehensive policy aimed at modernising the industry, so thatits well-being can be put on a firm foundation and so that it can contributeeven more effectively to the growth of the national economy.II. Economic Condition of the Agricultural industry the Course of Production15. Despite poor weather, agricultural production generally is expectedto be higher in 1965/66 than in 1964/65. With a larger acreage and goodyields, especially for barley, the production of cereals increased by nearly one million tons. The yield of potatoes has been exceptionally heavy and produc-tion reached a high level, in spite of a reduced acreage. The sugar beet cropwas above average in tonnage but below normal in sugar content. Althoughhome production of beef, mutton and lamb is likely to be at much the same level as in 1964/65, the numbers of beef cows and breeding ewes have againincreased. The dairy herd has also shown some recovery and the outputof milk is higher than ever before. Marketings of pigs in 1965/66 havebeen at a high level but the pig breeding herd has fallen sharply in recent months. Home supplies of eggs over the year are expected to be down byabout 4 per cent. The poor hay crop has caused a more rapid increase inthe consumption of animal feedingstuffs.16. The index of agricultural net output is forecast at 139 for 1965/66compared with 137 for 1964/65 and 127 for 1963/64 (average of 1954/55to 1956/57 = 100. Appendix I, Table K, page 31). The relatively small increase in 1965/66 as compared with the increase in the previous year was largely due to the difference in weather.Income17. The actual net income of the industry in 1965/66 compared with1964/65 is forecast to have fallen by  12 million to  463^ million. If adjusted to normal weather conditions, the forecast is raised to  472^ million,  12-Jmillion or some 3 per cent more than the income on a normal weather basis in 1964/65. The trend of actual net income, as indicated by the three-yearmoving average, remains upward (Appendix II, Table A, page 32).18. Information on output, expenses and net income is obtained eachyear for some 3,500 farms of different types and sizes throughout the UnitedKingdom. As mentioned in paragraph 11 above, the detailed results of the survey in England and Wales appear in the annual &quot; Farm Incomes &quot; report.Corresponding information for Scotland will appear in &quot; Scottish Agricul-tural Economics &quot; and for Northern Ireland in the &quot; Statistical Review of farming in Northern Ireland &quot;. The latest survey figures relate to 1964/65and give no indication of the industry&apos;s income position in 1965/66. Butthey confirm the very substantial increase in net income which was forecasta year ago for 1964/65 in the 1965 Annual Review White Paper.  They also30559
indicate that this improvement benefited most types and sizes of farmsthroughout the country. Specimen figures illustrating the changes in net income between 1963/64 and 1964/65 are given in Appendix IV, page 37,Costs and Efficiency19. There have been further increases in the prices of goods and servicesused in agricultural production. It is calculated that these price changes would, at current levels of use, add in a full year a net total of  32 million to the cost of Review commodities. The main item is a rise in agriculturalwage rates (Appendix III, page 36). These increases in costs have beentaken into account along with the annual gain in efficiency, which is nowassessed at  30 million for Review commodities.20. Attention was drawn in the Plan to the high rate of growth in agricul-tural labour productivity which has been at the average rate of 6 to 7 per centin recent years. The number of workers employed in agriculture fell betweenJune 1964 and June 1965 by more than 30,000 to 550,000. The increase in productivity is forecast to continue in 1965/66 but at a somewhat lower rateowing to the relatively small increase in the index of net output.Cost of Agricultural Support21. The Exchequer cost in 1964/65 was  264 million. In 1965/66 it isexpected to fall to  244 million. This reflects substantially lower payments onbarley, eggs and beef, partly offset by higher payments on pigs and potatoes.The Estimates for the coming year (which do not take into account the deter-determinations made at this Review) show an increase to a figure of  265 million to allow for the increased quantities and rather lower prices expected.(Appendix V, Table A, page 39.)III. Commodities and Production grants the Growth of Demand22. The Plan estimates an increase in consumer expenditure on food at constant prices by over 1-3 per cent annually or by 8-4 per cent between1964 and 1970. For those products which can be grown in this country,the total increase is of the order of  200 million at 1964 import prices. Ofthis total nearly  100 million is on account of increased demand for meat,including bacon and poultry meat. Home meat production has, therefore,one of the most important parts to play in the selective expansion programme.Beef and Milk23. The Plan states that the main emphasis must be on the expansionof beef production which will need to be increased to the full extent of thetechnical possibilities. The Government will promote improvements in animal health and methods of rearing to reduce the number of calves lost throughdisease but these improvements will take time. But an increase in beef production will require an increase in the beef herd and also in the dairy herd,which is the source of some two-thirds of home-fed beef. This will entailan increase in milk production which, after meeting our requirements ofliquid milk and fresh cream, will supply a substantial part of the additional demand for milk products.
24. The beef breeding herd increased between June 1964 and June 1965from 982,000 to 1,018,000. The increase has.however been confined to the hills and the number of beef cows in other areas has been declining. BetweenJune 1964 and June 1965 there was also an increase in the dairy herd, from,144,000 to 3,186,000. This increase represents a partial recovery after thedecline which took place between 1962 and 1964. But at present the dairy herd is increasing only slowly despite the higher returns to dairy fannersover the past two years.25. Home production of beef has risen, although total supplies on thehome market during 1965/66 are likely to be about 5 per cent below lastyear&apos;s level because of lower imports (Appendix I, Table D and Fig. II,page 22). The rise in beef production has been limited by an increasein the average age at which animals are slaughtered and by a fall in importsof Irish stores ; but the number of calves retained has increased and it isexpected that there will be some further rise in the production of home-fedcattle in 1966/67. Production of milk has increased, partly because of theincrease in the dairy herd and partly because of the continuing, though slow,increase in milk yields.26. Although the beef and dairy herds are now expanding again, the fallin the beef breeding herd outside the hill areas must be halted and if possiblereversed. The recovery of the dairy herd must also be maintained. TheGovernment gave an assurance when the Plan was published that, in theabsence of any significant change in circumstances, the guaranteed price forbeef would be at least maintained at its present level for the next three years.They have also been convinced as a result of technical talks with the industry on milk requirements that the size of the reserve needed for the liquid marketmerits adjustment, with a consequent increase in the standard quantity.27. The Governments conclusion is that the required expansion of thebeef and dairy herds calls for a combination of measures. The guaranteed price for fat cattle will be increased by 10s. Od. per cwt. In order to encouragebeef production in the areas which do not qualify for hill cow subsidy, a beefcow subsidy of  6 10s. per head will be introduced for cows kept whollyor mainly for the purpose of producing calves for beef (see para. 55). the seasonal scale of standard prices for cattle will again be adjusted in line with the pattern of market prices. The scale of abatements and supplementsunder the graduated deficiency payments scheme will be adjusted in the lightof expected market conditions.28. At the same time the guaranteed price for milk will be increased by d. per gallon. In the light of the technical study, the standard quantity willbe increased by 62-4 million gallons. After allowing for the automaticdecrease of 12-4 million gallons due to the fact that liquid sales were belowexpectations, this gives a net increase of 50 million gallons which is equivalentto an additional -Jd. per gallon on the guaranteed price. The arrangementsfor financing the Milk Boards&apos; schemes for improving compositional qualitywill continue unchanged.29. The Government have also given the assurances on the guaranteed price for cattle, the beef cow subsidy and milk set out. in paragraph 9.1130659 A 4
30. Details of the changes in the guarantee arrangements are given inAppendix VI, Part II, page 46.Sheep and Wool31. The Plan envisages that home production can make a substantial contribution to our slowly increasing requirements for mutton and lamb,consistently with our commitments to our overseas suppliers.32. The total breeding flock has continued to expand, but the expansionis only in the hills. In the lowlands the breeding flock has decreased.Both home-fed and imported supplies of mutton and lamb in 1965/66 areexpected to be much the same as in the previous year. The market has remained strong, partly because of the strength of the beef market.33. The guaranteed price for fat sheep and the hill sheep subsidy arethe primary means of implementing Government policy for sheep. The returns of sheep producers are, however, affected by the prices realised for wool,which are subject to the fluctuations of the world market. To reduce the impact on United Kingdom sheep producers of such fluctuations, price stabilisation arrangements have been operated in association with the priceguarantee. These arrangements will continue under the new financial agreement made on 1st April 1965 between the Government and the BritishWool Marketing Board. Market prices for the 1965 wool clip, althoughsomewhat firmer than for 1964, have remained well below the guaranteed price, which the Government left unchanged last year. In the governments view, there is no reasonable prospect that market prices will exceed the guaranteed price at its present level. A situation in which the market price of wool is each year likely to be below the price paid to producers, so thatcontinuing advances from the Exchequer are necessary to meet the deficit, is incompatible with a price stabilisation arrangement. The Government have therefore decided to reduce the guaranteed price by 2d. per lb.34. They recognise however that a reduction in the wool price is boundto affect the overall returns from sheep, particularly in the hills where woolis of relatively greater importance in the total return from the flock. TheGovernment do not wish to check the increase in the hill flock. The reduc-tion in the wool price is equivalent to a reduction of about 9d. per hill ewe,but the Government have decided to increase the hill sheep subsidy by Is. Od.which not only offsets the reduction due to wool but provides a small incen-tive. In the lowlands, where flocks have been declining, the reduction onwool will be equivalent to about ^d. per lb. on a fat lamb. In orderto compensate lowland producers for this reduction and to encourage the moderate rate of expansion which is desired, the Government have decidedto increase the guaranteed price for fat sheep by fd. per lb.35. Adjustments will be made to the scale of abatements and supple-ments under the graduated deficiency payments scheme. Details are givenin Appendix VI, Part II, page 46.Pigs36. Under the Plan the objective is that home production should meetthe whole of the growth in demand for pork, together with the United
Kingdom&apos;s share of the bacon market under the bacon market sharing under-standing. The minimum allocation for the United Kingdom is being in-creased slightly in 1966/67.37. In the fatstock year 1965/66 about 13-8 million pigs will have beencertified for guarantee, about 1-2 million more than in 1964/65. In thecircumstances of this year when supplies of beef have been relatively shortthe increase in pig production helped to stabilise meat prices. But the excess over the rise in demand resulted in substantially lower market prices for pigs over much of the year, and a rise in the Exchequer cost from  32million to  43 million. The flexible guarantee arrangements, as intended,came into play, and as the forecast level of marketings increased, the effective guaranteed price was automatically reduced by a further 9d. inMay 1965, making a total deduction of 2s. 3d. from the basic guaranteed price.38. But the pig breeding herd is now falling from the very high levelreached in 1965. A fall in the forecast level of certifications led in February1966 to the restoration of 9d. to the effective guaranteed price. It is expectedthat production will be lower in 1966/67 than in the current year. Havingregard to the expansion of pig production required under the Plan theGovernment have decided to raise the level of the middle band in theflexible guarantee arrangements by 400,000 pigs so that the new middleband will be 12-4-13-2 million. Details are given in Appendix VI, Part II,page 47. Although no change will be made in the basic guaranteed price,the immediate consequence of raising the level of the middle band will be toincrease the effective guaranteed price by 9d. per score.39. As a further step towards elimination of the quality premiums onbacon pigs, the quality premium for AA+ pigs will be reduced to Is. 6d. perscore and that for AA pigs will be eliminated. The remaining premiumfor AA+ pigs will be discontinued at the end of the 1966/67 fatstockyear, thus completing the process begun at the 1965 Annual Reviewof letting the market decide and pay for the quality it requires in thecarcase. The Government wish to support the efforts which producers andtrade are making to identify and reward those characteristics which thetrade requires. From 18th April 1966 the existing bacon pig grades otherthan the AA+ grade will be replaced by carcase measurements recom-mended by the Pig Industry Development Authority for classifying carcasesof bacon pigs. In the course of the year the Agricultural Departments willexplore, in collaboration with the Authority and the industry, the practical application of the optical probe in carcase classification.Eggs40. The Plan requirement is that production should meet the expected increase in demand, which is rising at a lower rate than the capacity of theindustry to increase production.41. The very high level of production reached in 1964/65 resulted in*  surpluses and very low market prices which in turn caused a fall in productionin 1965/66 estimated at about 4 per cent. (Appendix I, Table E, Figure III,page 25). - Packing station throughput has also fallen and the British EggMarketing Board&apos;s average selling price is expected to reach the indicator30659
price of 3s, 2d. Prices to producers have been higher and the level of exchequer cost will be substantially lower. But these increases in prices have led producers to increase their flocks again. In the last few months chickhatchery orders for laying flocks have increased substantially compared withthe same period in 1964/65 and it is expected that production will rise again in 1966/67, although not to the level of 1964/65.42. The Board have drawn up new contract marketing arrangements under which eggs sold to them under contract will receive a premium.These arrangements, when introduced, will make for more level deliveriesand help to prevent large fluctuations in supply.43. The present guarantee arrangements for eggs were introduced at the1963 Annual Review, and it was then announced that the working of thearrangements would be reviewed during the third year of their operation.This has been done and, to assist the Board to stabilise returns during theperiod before their contract arrangements can influence market priceseffectively, the Government have decided to postpone for two years thereduction (which would otherwise have been made this year) from 40 percent, to 30 per cent, in the proportion borne by the Exchequer of any amount by which the Board&apos;s average selling price falls short of theindicator price.44. The danger that production will outrun demand nevertheless remainsand some reduction in the guaranteed price is necessary. The indicatorprice is being reduced to 3s. Id. per dozen and the guaranteed price willbe reduced by l-6d. The effect will be a net reduction of Id. in the value ofthe guarantee.Eggs and Pigs Feed Formulae45. The feed formulae arrangements, which provide automatic adjust-ments to the guaranteed prices for pigs and eggs in accordance with changesin feed costs, will be considered during the coming year to ensure that the automatic price adjustments correspond more closely to the changes in feedcosts borne by producers.Cereals46. The Plan recognises that the expansion of likestock production will increase considerably the demand for cereal feed and that, consistently withour international obligations, a substantial part of this additional require-ment should be produced in this country. The Government therefore under-took, when the Plan was announced, that standard quantities for cerealswould not be reduced below existing levels over the next three years, but would be related to the expected growth in the market.47. The acreage sown to cereals in 1965 rose by some 600,000 acres, to, over 9 million. The acreages both of wheat and barley increased, and therewas again a fall in the oats acreage. Despite the poor weather at harvest-time, yields, except for wheat, were higher than in the previous year.Production for 1965/66 is estimated at 13^ million tons, which is nearly one million tons higher than in 1964/65, the base year of the Plan. this increase has kept pace with the abnormally big increase in consumption in.1965/66.
48. The Government are bound by the Agreements on cereals made inApril 1964 with our principal overseas suppliers. In. particular, there is anundertaking that effective remedial action would be taken if there was, or threatened to be, a significant reduction in imports below the level of thethree year average up to 30th June 1964 (9 million tons) and this was due toinsufficient restraint on the financial assistance to home producers. Althoughimports are again expected to fall below 9 million tons, the determinationsmade at the 1965 Annual Review were announced after most of the 1965crops had been sown, and the reductions then made in the guaranteed prices for wheat and barley have not had time to exert their full effect on cerealsproduction. The operation of the target indicator price and standard quantity arrangements will, if production continues to expand above thestandard quantities, have an automatic effect on producers&apos; returns. TheGovernments decision to reduce the ploughing grant (see para. 59) will also provide less incentive to plough up grassland for cereals.49. In these circumstances, the Government consider that this year nochange should be made in the guaranteed prices for cereals, but that havingregard to the growth of demand, the standard quantity for wheat shouldbe increased by 250,000 tons and that for barley by 600,000 tons.Potatoes50. Except in years of unusually low yields, the United Kingdom shouldbe able fully to meet the home demand for main crop potatoes, including thesmall annual increase expected under the Plan.51. The total acreage planted to potatoes (main crop and earlies) declinedby 40,000 in 1965 to 740,000 acres. This decline was more than offset byan increase of one ton per acre in the yield, giving a record yield of 10 tons per acre. As a result there has been in 1965/66 a substantial surplus overand above requirements for human consumption, with adverse effects onmarket prices. Government-assisted buying programmes under the newmarket support arrangements introduced in August 1965 have helped tostrengthen the market and to assure growers of a reasonable return fortheir surplus potatoes.52. A further decline in acreage of main crop and early potatoes isexpected in 1966. The outcome of the crop will depend on the yield ; but although the trend of yields in recent years has been upwards, the yield ina particular year is dependent on the weather and cannot be predicted.This year&apos;s high yield was partly due to the weather. To encourage theplanting of an acreage which, unless yields are unusually low, would enablehome production to meet the home demand for main crop potatoes, theGovernment have decided to increase the guaranteed price by 5s. Od.per ton.Sugar Beet       fc53. The Plan envisages home production of sugar supplying part of the increasing demand within the existing contract acreage and factory capacity and without raising international problems.   The present contract acreage30659\\   A 6
of 443,000 acres is being fully take up at the present level of the guaranteed price. The Government have decided that no change need be made in thelevel of the guaranteed price or the contract acreage at this Review.Production Grants54. The Plan says that the more the industry can reduce costs throughincreasing productivity, the more it will save real resources, and the less itwill depend upon Government support to maintain and improve its income.For this reason the Government repeated their intention to continue to assistthe industry to increase productivity through the direct farming grants. Atthe same time these grants must be looked at to see whether they still reflect the industry&apos;s current needs and contribute towards the modernisation ofthe industry&apos;s methods of farm management and husbandry. This has beendone and the following decisions have been taken.55. Beef Cow Subsidy. This is a new subsidy intended to help farmersengaged in livestock rearing in the uplands and on poor land elsewherewho are not eligible for the hill cow and winter keep subsidies, and to checkand reverse the present downward trend in the beef herd in areas outsidethe hills. The subsidy will be at the rate of  6 10s. per head but will belimited by reference to the available acreage of grass and forage crops and,except for separately-managed herds of beef breeds, by reference to thequantity of milk sold off the farm. Other conditions, including the detailed application of the scheme in Scotland and Northern Ireland, will be announced later.56. Farm Business Recording Scheme. Proper business records are anessential basis for sound decisions on farm management. In the 1965 annual review White Paper the Government said that they would introduce a pilotscheme to encourage record keeping in certain areas with a view to extending the scheme later. The Farm Business Recording Scheme was accordinglyintroduced in certain counties in Great Britain and throughout NorthernIreland on 1st November 1965. The Scheme has made a good start and about 1,500 applications have already been received. It is proposed to extend the Scheme to the whole country during 1966.57. Northern Ireland Special Assistance Grant. In the 1965 annual review White Paper the Government undertook to review the level of thisgrant. This has been done, and, as already announced, the grant has been raised from  1  to  If million with effect from 1st April 1966.58. Fertiliser and Lime Subsidies. Fertilisers and lime are both ofimportance in bringing about the growth in production and productivityrequired under the Plan. The Government; believe that encouragement to maintain the usage of fertilisers should, within reasonable limits, becontinued, and as the cost to the Exchequer of the fertiliser subsidy is not expected to increase in the financial year 1965/66, the Government havedecided that at this Review the subsidy arrangements should be leftunchanged. In the case of lime the rate of subsidy continues to be high(it is now about 60 per cent) and the Government consider that it could bereduced without discouraging an adequate use of lime.-  They have therefore
decided to amend further the rates of contribution so as to reduce the total annual subsidy by an estimated  If million.59. Ploughing Grant Scheme. At present, under Part I of this Scheme, agrant at the rate of  5 per acre is payable for the ploughing up of landthat has been at least three years under grass. The purpose of the grant was at first to encourage the ploughing up of grassland for tillage crops and in later years to encourage ley farming. Since then methods of grasslandmanagement and arable husbandry have changed considerably, and in the government&apos;s view it is undesirable to provide so large an incentive for aparticular form of husbandry which, while it may be suitable in some cases,is not necessarily appropriate in others. At its present level the grantencourages farmers to keep a ley for three years, in order to qualify for the ploughing grant, when it may be more economic to provide a cereal breakby a shorter ley or an alternative crop. The grant will therefore be reducedto  2 10s. per acre.60. Grassland Renovation Scheme. This Scheme has attracted littlesupport since its introduction in 1963 and the Government have decided notto renew it when it expires on 31st August 1966.61. Silo Subsidy Scheme. This Scheme will expire in 1966, but grant-aid for the construction of silos will be available under the proposed new farm improvement Scheme.IV. The Total Award62. In accordance with the Agriculture Act 1957 the present deterrnina-tions must be such as to maintain the total value of the guarantees* at notless than 97-J- per cent, of their total value in 1965/66 ( 1,518 million) after allowing for the cost increase of  32 million on Review commodities. Themaximum permissible reduction in the value of the guarantees is thereforeabout  6 million.63. The determinations now made add  23 million to the total value ofthe guarantees. The Government are satisfied that these determinationstake full account of the requirements of national economic policy, theeconomic condition of the agricultural industry and the production objectives of the selective expansion programme.64. This programme is based upon the maintenance of an increasing rateof productivity. The Government recognise that this rising productivity mustbe used not only to help meet rising costs, but also to finance further invest-ment and improve the income, and so the standard of living, of the full-timecommercial farmer. The Governmenfs recognition of this will be a basicfactor influencing their determinations at future Annual Reviews duringthe period of the present Plan. Further discussions on this matter will beheld with the Farmers&apos; Unions during the year.* The total value of the guarantees is the sum of (i) the value of the price guarantees (calculated for each commodity by multiplying the guaranteed price by thequantity of output qualifying for the guarantee) and (ii) the value of the relevant pro-duction grants.

APPENDIX nAggregate Farming Net Income in the United kingdom note. The revised figures given in this Appendix for the &quot; Departmental&quot;calculation of aggregate net income in the year 1964/65 replace the forecasts whichwere published in last year&apos;s White Paper when the outcome for the latter part ofthat year was not known. In addition new statistical information which has become available affects the figures for 1964/65 and some earlier years. Forecasts for 1965/66are as at mid-January 1966.Table A  million	&quot; Departmental&quot; Calculation		&quot; Raised Sample &quot; CalculationYear	Actual	Three Year Moving Average of Actual	1946/47      .........	1961	-	1671947/48      .........	23 11	243	1611948/49......	301	283	2371949/50      .........	316i	2991	2251950/51       .........	2801	312	2041951/52      .........	3381	323	23311952/53       .........	.3491	345	2701953/54      .........	347	337	3091954/55      .........	314	337	258-11955/56      .........	3501	335	28511956/57      ......i ...	341	356	3051957/58      .....,	377	351	3601958/59      ......	334*	3581	3481959/60      ...      ......	3641	365	31411960/61	396	396	3501961/62      ...      ......	428	425	3941962/63       .........	451	4291	4061963/64      .........	. 4091	4451	3701964/65      .........	4751 (460)	4491	4381965/66 (forecast)  ......	4631 (4721)	- &apos;	(not yet available)Note ( ).  The &quot; Departmental &quot; calculation is for years beginning 1st June.Note (ii). The figures in brackets for 1964/65 and 1965/66 are adjusted to normal weather conditions.
Note (Hi). The &quot; Departmental &quot; and &quot; raised sample &quot; estimates of aggregatefarming net income in Table A are arrived at after making provision for depreciation.Net income can be defined as the reward for the manual and managerial labour ofthe farmer and his wife, and for the use of the occupier&apos;s investment.: Note (iv). These two series of aggregate farming net income are calculated in fundamentally different ways. The &quot; Departmental&quot; estimate is built up from the statistics of income and expenditure for the whole &quot;national&quot; farm, whereas the*&apos; raised sample &quot; is based on some 3,500 actual farm accounts, which are expanded or &quot; raised &quot; to give an aggregate for all farms in the United Kingdom. There area number of reasons why the levels of aggregate net income shown in these two series should vary but it is difficult to make a quantitative assessment of the individualcauses.  Both series are of value in indicating the general trend in the level of income.Note (v). The &quot; Departmental&quot; estimates for aggregate net income include asprofit in recent years about  8 million on the production of food for consumption in the farm household. In other industries the corresponding sums are not treatedas profit and are relatively much smaller (in many cases non-existent).Note: (vi). From the &quot; Departmental&quot; figures for aggregate net income certainsums should have been appropriated by farmers to cover the excess of replacement cost over original cost of certain assets (slaughter stock, cultivations, growing crops,etc.) used up in the course of the year&apos;s production and trade.

Note (i). The figures for years up to and including 1964/65 represent actual expenditure recorded in the Appropriation Accounts. The figures for 1965/66 arethe latest estimates (Hansard, 7th February 1966, Written Answers, cols. 25-26) of cash expenditure in the United Kingdom (Civil Estimates Class V, Votes 3,4, 5 and 6).The figures for 1966/67 are based on the Civil Estimates for that year and do not take account of the determinations in this White Paper (see however Note (viii)).Note (ii). Payments in respect of cereals, potatoes and wool relate partly to the crops or clip of the year indicated and partly to the crops or clips of the preceding year or years.Note (Hi). Figures for milk exclude expenditure on school and welfare milk.Following the 1962 Annual Review the retail price of milk was arranged so that neither a deficiency nor a surplus will arise, taking one year with another, from the implementation of the price guarantee.Note (iv). Expenditure on tuberculosis eradication relates to bonus payments under the Attested Herds Scheme only and excludes compensation payments forslaughtered reactors.Note (v). The item &quot; other grants &quot; includes in 1965/66 grants to producers inthe Scottish Islands, grassland renovation, rabbit clearance societies, improvementof livestock, bracken eradication and machinery syndicates. ,Note (vi).   Of the grants made in 1965/66 the following are relevant production grants for the purposes of the Agriculture Act 1957, and the 1966 Annual Review: Fertilisers subsidy.Lime subsidy.Ploughing grants.Grassland renovation.Field drainage grants for ditching and moling (estimated cost  0-6 million in1965/66; figure in the Table includes expenditure on tiling schemes).Bonus payments under the Tuberculosis (Attested Herds) Scheme.Calf subsidy.Hill cattle and hill cow subsidies.Hill sheep subsidy.Winter keep.Silo subsidies.Grants to small farmers.Grants for farm business recording.Grants to producers in the Scottish Islands.Grants to rabbit clearance societies.Arrangements for the benefit of agricultural producers in Northern Irelandfinanced from the U.K. Exchequer.Grants for agricultural marketing development.Grants for agricultural co-operation.Grants for agricultural credit.Note (vii). The Table excludes the cost of grants for agricultural marketingdevelopment, agricultural co-operation and agricultural credit mentioned in Note (vi)above. The estimated cost of these grants is  0-2 million in 1965/66 and  0-4 million in 1966/67. Grants for horticulture are also excluded. The estimated costof them, including horticultural co-operation and credit, is  2-1 million in 1965/66and  2 - 6 million in 1966/67.Note (viii). On the basis of the original assumptions as. to output and market prices the estimated effect of the determinations set out in this White Paper, together with theproposed increases in the retail price of milk, is a net increase of about  15m. in thetotal estimated cost ( 265m.) of agricultural support by the Exchequer in 1966/67.This net increase is the result broadly of increases of  ^m. on wheat,  3m. on barley, 124m. on cattle,  l^m. on sheep,  2m. on pigs and decreases of  3m. on eggs,  jm.on wool and  lm. on production grants.The figures do not include the effect on deficiency payments of any changes in output during the year which may be ascribed to Review changes.The net effect of the determinations on the Estimates differs from the effect on thevalue of the guarantees for several reasons; the more important are that the priceguarantee arrangements for some commodities do not involve Exchequer payments and that the payment periods for some items do not correspond with the financialyear.

Because marketings and prices of fatstock and wheat may vary from those forecast, producers&apos; average returns under the guarantees for those products inany year may differ slightly from the guaranteed prices.(b) The guaranteed price for pigs is subject to the flexible guarantee and feed formulaarrangements.(c) The guaranteed prices for hen and duck eggs are subject to the indicator price andfeed formula arrangements.(d) The guaranteed price for milk includes 0-25d. per gallon special assistance forcompositional quality.  The guaranteed price is subject to the standard quantity arrangements.(e) The guaranteed prices for wheat and barley are subject to the standard quantity/targetindicator price arrangements.(/) The guaranteed price for barley is subject to arrangements whereby, to encourage amore even spread of marketings over the season, the deficiency payments are subject topremiums for barley delivered, after sale, in the later months of the cereal year and deductionsfor barley delivered in the early months of the year.
Part II.  Additional Details of guarantees. The guaranteed prices shown in Part I of this Appendix for livestock and livestock products in 1966/67 and for crops of the 1966 harvest will be on a similar basis to those for the previous year except as stated in the following paragraphs.Milk2. The provisional standard quantity for each area in 1966/67 has been calculated as follows :-^England and WalesMain Scottish AreaAberdeen and DistrictNorth of ScotlandNorthern IrelandProvisionalStandardQuantity19651661,792-2188-620-19-9100-million gallonsAdjustments Adjustmentsfor Changesin LiquidSales-11-8- 1-3 .No change4- 0-14- 0-6 in Light ofTechnicalStudy4-52-94- 5-64- 0-64- 0-34- 3-0ProvisionalStandardQuantity1966/671,83319220101032,111-0-12-44-62-42,161-03.

Adjustment of Seasonal Scale. With effect from 28th March, 1966, the seasonalscale of weekly standard prices will be adjusted so as to reduce the level of prices by up to 2s. 6d. per live cwt. over the period December to May. Compensatingincreases will be made over the rest of the year so as to maintain a guaranteed priceof 184s. Od. per live cwt.5. Graduated Deficiency Payments Scheme. With effect from 28th March, 1966,the scale of abatements and supplements will be adjusted to take account of the expected market situation for the year. If the average market price for a week isbelow the standard price for the same week, and the deficiency is within the range10s. 0d.-14s. Od. per live cwt., a guarantee payment of the amount of this deficiencywill be paid in respect of the week: but if the deficiency in the week exceeds 14s. Od.per cwt., or is less than 10s. Od. per cwt., the guarantee payment will be subject toabatement or supplement in accordance with scales determined at the Review, whichare being published separately.Fat Sheep6. Graduated Deficiency Payments Scheme. With effect from 28th March, 1966,the scale of abatements and supplements will be adjusted to take account of the expected market situation for the year. If the average market price for a week isbelow the standard price for the same week, and the deficiency is within the range2-75d.-4-25d. per lb. estimated dressed carcase weight, a guarantee payment of theamount of this deficiency will be paid in respect of the week: but if the deficiency in the week exceeds 4-25d. per lb. or is less than 2-75d. per lb., the guarantee payment will be subject to abatement or supplement in accordance with scales determined attrie Review, which are being published separately.
Fat Pigs7. Flexible Guarantee Scale. The flexible guarantee scale (set out in paragraph 9 of appendix VI, Part II of the 1965 Annual Review White Paper) will be modified andwith effect from 28th March, 1966, the scale will be as follows: Adjustment to the basicForecast level of certifications10-8 million or more but less than 11-2 million11-211-612-012-413-213-614-014-411-612-012-413-213-614-014-414-8guaranteed price+ 3s. 6d.4- 2s. 3d.+ Is. 6d.+ 9d.Basic guaranteed price9d.- Is.  6d.- 2s.   3d.- 3s.  6d.There will be a further adjustment of Is. 3d. for each complete 0-4 million or part thereof by which the forecast annual level of certifications falls below 10-8 million or exceeds 14-8 million.8. Quality Premium. With effect from 28th March, 1966, quality premium willbe paid only on pigs graded AA+.  The rate will be Is. 6d. per score.Eggs9. In 1966/67 the indicator prices provided for by Article 4 of the Eggs (guaranteed prices) Order 1963 (1963 No. 569) as amended by the Eggs (Guaranteed Prices)(Amendment) Order 1964 (1964 No. 462) will be 3s. Id. per dozen for hen eggs and2s. 2d. per dozen for duck eggs. If, during 1966/67 and 1967/68, the British EggMarketing Board&apos;s average selling price for hen or duck eggs is below the appropriateindicator price, the proportion of the difference to be met by the Exchequer willremain at 40 per cent, instead of being reduced to 30 per cent, in accordance withthe arrangements introduced at the 1963 and 1964 Annual Reviews and set out inthe Orders referred to above. The Government intend to reduce the proportion met by the Exchequer by 10 per cent, a year from 1968/69 onwards.Cereals10. Standard Quantities.as follows:WheatBarleyThe standard quantities for wheat and barley will beChange4- 250+ 600thousand tonsStandard quantity for 1966 Harvest3,6507,35011. Target Indicator Prices. The target indicator prices will be 20s. 6d. per cwt.for wheat and 19s. Od. per cwt. for barley. If a change should be made in the courseof the cereal year in the relevant minimum import prices, an identical change wouldbe made in the target indicator price, and an average target indicator price for the cereal year would be used throughout the calculations.12. Escalator Arrangement. The escalator arrangement will operate within a range of production of 3-45 to 3-65 million tons for wheat and 6-90 to 7-35 million tons for barley (subject to any adjustments consequent on the crop adjustment formula).Sugar Beet13. For the 1966 crop the maximum acreage to which the guarantee will applywill be 427,400 acres in England and Wales and 15,600 acres in Scotland. Themaximum acreage for the 1967 crop will be the same as in 1966.(30659) Dd. 124792  K140   3/66   St.S.
