REPORTTo the Rt. Honourable the Minister of LabourSir,1. We were appointed by you on 26th May 1966, as a Court of Inquiryunder the provisions of the Industrial Courts Act 1919, to inquire into various matters concerning the Shipping Industry. We now report to you as a matterof urgency upon the first of the four subjects which you required us to inquire into, namely, the immediate causes and circumstances of the present dispute between shipowners and the National Union of Seamen, bearing in mind the matters referred to in the second of those subjects.2. We have held hearings on 2nd, 3rd and 6th June 1966. At the requestof both parties, the Court decided to hold the hearings in private. The case for the owners has been presented by Mr. Ford I. Geddes, M.B.E., Mr.J. K. Rice-Oxley, Mr. M. E. Bates, Mr. H. Bruce Glasier, C.B.E.,Mr. R. A. Huskisson, Mr. S. G. Read and Mr. F. J. Whitworth representingthe Shipping Federation Limited and the Employers&apos; Association of the port of Liverpool The case for the National Union of Seamen has been presented by Mr. W. Hogarth, Mr. W. Marshall and Mr. T. Sutton. We have also considered the written evidence supplied by both parties.Introductory matters3. Some of the arrangements affecting seamen are determined by statute or statutory regulations, but since 1919 their pay and hours and conditions ofwork have for the most part been negotiated on the National Maritime Board.The Board consists of six panels, of which the two which are relevant to thepresent Report are the Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Panel and the Catering Depart-ment Panel. Each Panel consists of twelve representatives on each side.The employers are the Shipping Federation and the Employers&apos; Associationof the Port of Liverpool, and they jointly appoint the employers&apos; representa-tives on the Panels. The employees&apos; representatives on the Sailors&apos; and firemen&apos;s Panel are appointed by the National Union of Seamen, to whom we shall refer as &quot; the N.U.S.&quot;, and the employees&apos; representatives on the catering Department Panel are appointed by the Catering Department Sectionof the N.U.S. In the minutes of meetings the employers are referred to as theOwners, and the employees as the Seafarers.4. Those with whom the Sailors&apos; and Firemen&apos;s Panel are concerned arenow more usually referred to as deck and engine-room hands or ratings.The deck ratings and the engine-room ratings are traditionally separate bodies of men. Both are divided into watchkeepers, who regularly have four hourson duty followed by eight hours off duty, and dayworkers. The cateringdepartment includes the kitchen staff, the dining saloon stewards and thecabin stewards. The numbers in this department are relatively small on a cargo ship, and large, sometimes very large, on a passenger ship, but thereare many more cargo ships than passenger ships. Of the seamen to whomthis Inquiry relates about half are in the catering department and the otherhalf are deck and engine-room ratings. Then according to the &quot; Owners &quot;figures, of the deck and engine-room ratings about three quarters are31001
watchkeepers and about one quarter are dayworkers. These proportionsare of course only rough approximations.5. Ships vary greatly in size, type, capacity and function. There are tankers,bulk cargo ships, specialised cargo ships and passenger ships. There areforeign-going ships and home trade ships. The expression &quot; home trade &quot;has a somewhat extended meaning, including voyages between UnitedKingdom ports and the nearer Continental ports. Of the seamen to whichthis Inquiry relates about four-fifths sail in foreign-going ships, and about one-fifth in home trade ships. This Inquiry is not concerned with the crews of fishing boats.6. The rates of pay for ratings (deck hands, engine-room hands and thosein the catering department) fixed by the National Maritime Board are nationalstandard rates. They apply to those engaged in the United Kingdom on ordinary Board of Trade Articles as crews for ships of 200 tons and upwards.There are monthly rates with food supplied, and these are wholly or mainly for the crews of foreign-going ships. There are also weekly rates on terms of&quot; finding own food &quot;, and these are substantially proportionate to the monthlyrates except that a food allowance of 21 shillings is included. The weeklyrates are for home trade ships. If the owner provides food, the sum of 21shillings is deducted. It will be convenient for purposes of illustration totake the pay of an Able Seaman who is engaged in a foreign-going ship and,in addition to his consolidated basic rate, is entitled to efficient service payafter five years of satisfactory service and to certificate pay for holding anAble Seaman&apos;s certificate.  This is the standard practice of both sides.7. One feature of a seaman&apos;s service which is very important in this case isthat when at sea you cannot have a &quot; weekend shut-down &quot;. The engineshave to operate and the ship to run and all on board to be fed for seven days in the week, and therefore in general the watchkeepers, both on deck and inthe engine-room, and those in the catering department have to work for seven days a week so long as the ship is at sea. Another feature, however, is thatseamen spend a good deal of time working by their ships while in port. A thirdfeature is a very large amount of overtime working. We have been informedthat the average weekly working time for a seaman in a foreign-going ship is66 hours and in a home trade ship is 73-6 hours. It was explained to us thatleisure at sea is not of great interest to the crew and that they prefer to havean abundance of paid work. That was the evidence of the Owners&apos; side. Theevidence from the N.U.S. side was to a somewhat different effect, but we think there is no substantial conflict. What the Owners said is right as a generalisa-tion, but there must be some individuals among the seamen who would prefermore leisure, and on a long voyage no doubt many would like to have anoccasional day or half-day off duty even though it would be without pay.From the large amounts of overtime earnings it follows that basic rates arevery incomplete indications of actual remuneration. The foreign-going Able* Seamen in fact earns on the average  19 17s. 6d. a week. The home TradeAble Seaman earns on the average  22 16s. Id. a week.* Nevertheless for thepurpose of explaining the dispute which eventually arose it is necessary to* These figures are estimated from the Owners&apos; census of hours conducted in 1965. for various reasons they are not exactly comparable with figures of average earnings in otherindustries published by the Ministry of Labour.
trace in outline the history of the basic remuneration and certain ancillarybenefits. Before coming to this history, it is right to add, as a fourth feature of sea service, that the seaman in a foreign-going ship not only has the interest ofa sea voyage but also enjoys free board and lodging and has no expense of travelling to work. Those are advantages to be set off against the dis-advantages of being away from home and away from ordinary occupations and pursuits.History of changes in seamen&apos;s pay arrangements and of the events leading up to the dispute8. The owners have supplied a table and other data showing the typicalAble Seaman&apos;s basic remuneration for a 56 hour week at sea from the year1950 onwards. The monthly rate increased by almost regular annualadditions from  20 in 1950 to  41 10s. Od. in 1964. There was certificatepay, for holding an Able Seaman&apos;s certificate, at the rate of 10s. Od. per month from 1955 to 1960 and thereafter at  1 per month. There wasefficient service pay after a sufficient period of satisfactory service, andthe maximum rate for this rose from  4 per month in 1950 to  4 10s. Od.per month in 1964. There was also a &quot;Sunday at sea leave agreement&quot;.From 1951 onwards for every Sunday which he spent at sea the Able Seamanwas entitled to one day of paid leave, or he oould take the payment without taking the leave. These days of paid leave under the &quot; Sunday at sea leaveagreement&quot; were additional to the standard number of days of paid leavein the year.9. There were important further developments in the year 1960. First,the ordinary hours for working in port were reduced from 56 per week to44 per week, ending at noon on Saturday, so that hours worked in porton Saturday afternoons and Sundays counted as overtime payable at the overtime rate. Secondly, there would now be a half-day of paid leave foreach Saturday afternoon spent at sea. Thirdly, three public holidays would now count as Sundays for the purposes of the &quot; Sunday at sea leaveagreement&quot;.10. There were also important further developments in the year 1961.First, the ordinary hours for working at sea were reduced from 56 per week to 44 per week, ending at noon on Saturday, so that hours worked at sea on Saturday afternoons and Sundays counted as overtime payable at the overtime rate. Secondly, in lieu of the half-day of paid leave for eachSaturday afternoon spent at sea, there was to be included in the basic ratea &quot; compounded compensation for Saturday afternoon at sea&quot; equal to5 per cent, of the monthly rate.11. In 1961-64 there were numerous minor improvements in the pay and conditions of service, including a provision that three more public holidays should be counted as Sundays for the purposes of the &quot; Sunday at sea leave agreement&quot;. Also there were in 1964 increases in the standardperiods of paid annual leave (1) for foreign-going established ratings, from14 to 16 days, (ii) for home trade established ratings, from 12 to 16 days,(iii) for unestablished ratings from 8 to 14 days.
12. In the 1964 Year Book of the National Maritime Board the basic pay of the Able Seaman was set out in this way (except that we arestating only the effect of the provisions contained in the fifth column):  1. Rating	2. Monthly Rates (with free food)	v&apos; if Compounded Compensation for Saturday afternoon at sea	4. Consolidated basic	5. Efficient service pay and certificate pay	6. Total (with full efficient service pay and certificate pay where applicable)Able Seaman	   s. d. 39 10  6	  s. d. 1 19  6	  s. d. 41 10 0	(Amounting to  4 10s. Od. and  1  in the assumed case)	   s. d. 47  0  013. To arrive at the actual remuneration it would be necessary to addthe amount earned for overtime, the value of the right to additional leavein respect of Sundays and public holidays spent at sea and the value of anyother applicable benefits.A large part of the actual remuneration was outside the total basic wage,which was in the case of the typical Able Seaman only  47 per month.This had several disadvantages. It was detrimental to recruiting, unless alarge amount of overtime could be guaranteed, which might not be possible.It kept down the amount of pay which the seaman would receive when on leave and when working ordinary hours in port, it kept down the overtimerate, and it kept down the maximum of the allotment which the seamancould make in favour of dependants, this being a proportion of the totalbasic wage. Also there were some dayworkers who did not have theopportunity of working overtime.14. At meetings held early in 1965 it was decided by the relevant Panelsof the National Maritime Board that a new pay structure should beintroduced. The ordinary hours of work at sea were to be 56 instead of 44,because they would include 8 hours of work on Saturdays and 8 hours ofwork on Sundays, if required. In return for foregoing overtime pay forsuch hours on Saturdays and Sundays, the seamen were to have a greatlyincreased basic pay. The basic pay already included compounded com-pensation for Saturday afternoons at sea. Henceforth it was to includecompounded compensation for the whole of Saturdays at sea, and alsocompounded compensation for 8 hours of work per day on Saturdays andSundays at sea. Also there was an increase in the monthly rate. In the1965 Year Book of the Board the basic pay of the Able Seaman was setout in this way (except that we are stating only the effect of the provisions in the fifth column):  
	2.   &apos;	3.	. 4.&apos;..   &apos;*	5.	Rating	Monthly Rates (with free food)	Compounded compensation for (1) Saturdays at sea; (ii) 8 hours of work per day on-Saturdays and Sundays at sea	Consoli-dated basic	Efficient service pay and certificate pay	Total (with full efficient service pay and certificate pay also applicable)Able Seaman	  s. d. 40 13   6	  s. d. 12 4 0	  s. d. 52 17  6	(Amounting to  5 10s. Od. and  1 in the assumed case)	  s. d. 59 7  6					15. The sum of  12 4s. Od. of compounded compensation in the thirdcolumn was in fact made up of  4 Is. 4d. for Saturdays at sea and 8 2s. 8d. for 8 hours of work per day on Saturdays and Sundays at sea.Thus there was plainly set out in the Year Book the element of compen-sation for such work, and the amount of it was an ascertained figure.16. The increase in the basic rate increased the amounts which the seamanwould receive when on leave and when working ordinary hours in port.All hours of work in port on Saturdays and Sundays were to be overtimehours. Also there were increases in the overtime rates, and for the AbleSeaman this increase was from 4s. lOd. per hour to 6s. Od. per hour. Themaximum rate for efficient service pay was raised from  4 10s. Od. to 5 10s. Od. per month. Seven public holidays were to be counted as Sundaysfor the purposes of the &quot; Sunday at sea leave agreement&quot;. Annual leave for unestablished ratings was increased from 14 to 16 days. Other &quot; fringebenefits &quot; were granted.17. The combined effect of all the changes made in the year 1965 was highly beneficial to the seamen and very costly for the owners. In a press notice, issued by the Board after the meeting of 11th February 1965, atwhich the new arrangements were agreed upon, it was stated:  &quot; The percentage increase varies according to the pattern of a seafarer&apos;work and the pattern of the ship&apos;s trading. It is estimated, however,that the crew costs of a foreign-going cargo vessel with an average pattern of trading, may be increased by some 12 per cent*.&quot;.18. The new arrangements contained a defect, entailing a psychologicaldisadvantage and an element of inequity. The nominal working week at sea, instead of being reduced from 44 hours to 40 hours, as might havebeen expected, was increased to 56 hours. The seamen had been accustomed to receiving extra pay for work on Saturdays and Sundays if it was required. Now they would receive the same pay whether or not they workedon Saturdays and Sundays. The great majority of the seamen (all thewatchkeepers, all or most of those in the catering department and some ofthe dayworkers) would work through Saturdays and Sundays, but some of* This figure was subsequently amended to 131 per cent., and we now find that it shouldbe 14  per cent.
the day workers would not. And yet they would all receive the same pay.The existence of a defect in the new arrangements was realised at the timewhen they were negotiated. The minutes of the meeting of the Panels onthe 11th February 1965 record that the Chairman of the Seafarers&apos; Sidesaid:  &quot; He knew that some of his members would resent the 56 hour week at sea because at first glance it would seem to be a backward step. He felt sure that when it was fully explained they would accept it. He assured the Mtembers that everything would be done to ensure that the whole matter was clearly explained before the date the Agreement came into force &quot;.19. The Agreement came into force on the 29th March 1965.20. Disputes arose as to the kind of work that should be required atweek-ends at sea. It was a term of the Heads of Agreement annexed to theminutes of the meeting on the 10th February 1965 that the work at sea onthe public holidays which were to be counted as Sundays, should be limitedto watch-keeping and essential duties. It may have been implied that workon Sundays at sea (and perhaps also Saturdays at sea) should be similarlylimited. At any rate complaints were made. The principle, however, wasnot contested. When the complaints were referred to by the Chairmanof the Seafarers&apos; Side at a meeting of the Panels on the 4th November 1965,the Chairman of the Owners&apos; Side said that the owners had recommended to all their members that ratings should be given time off each week inthe course of a long voyage and he had personally written to the Chairmanof each company asking them to examine their arrangements for week-endmaintenance Work at sea in their vessels. He also said his side felt that thisrecommendation would prove successful if given time and he asked the unions to refer to him any complaints that they received.21. At the same meeting of the 4th November 1965 the Chairman of theSeafarers&apos; Side not only asked for a number of fringe benefits but also for a reduction of hours at sea, increased wages and leave. This far-reachingrequest came only about seven months after the important and expensivewages settlement which had come into force on the 29th March 1965.Not surprisingly the Owners&apos; Chairman asked that in view of the costs whichthis request would involve so soon after the last wages settlement the request should be withdrawn as his side were unable to meet it.22. There was a short meeting on the 13th lanuary 1966. The Owners&apos;Chairman referred to a report which had appeared in the Press earlier inthe week that &quot;The N.U.S. has decided against the advice of its general secretary Mr. William Hogarth to press for a general wages increase and hours reduction whatever reply the ship owners give next Thursday to a claim on fringe benefits &quot;. In reply the Chairman of the Seafarers&apos; Sideexplained that he had reported back to the members of his ExecutiveCouncil and they had expressed great concern at the Shipowners&apos; rejection of the claim relating to hours and wages. He went on to say that thegeneral feeling of seafarers throughout the country was for a straightforwardreduction in hours and a guarantee of time off while at sea and they alsowanted an increase in wages to cover the rise in the cost of living. He also said that their Executive Council would be meeting in a few days and adefinite decision would then be taken. He referred again to complaints of excessive work being required at week-ends and the Owners&apos; Chairman
said that measures had been taken to ensure that the Agreement workedproperly. The meeting was adjourned until the 1st February 1966.23. At the meeting of the 1st February 1966 the Chairman of theSeafarers&apos; Side said that at the meeting of the Executive Council it hadbeen decided after long discussion to present a claim for a 40-hour week at sea to be worked over 5 days within 7 days with no reduction in the consolidated basic rate, and they also requested that 12s. 6d. per month beadded to the consolidated basic pay for foreign-going Able Seamen withpro-rata increases for other ratings. He interpreted this claim as being for normal hours of work at sea to be 8 per day Monday to Friday and anyexcess hours to be paid at overtime rates. The Chairman of the Owners&apos;side argued at length against the claim. He said that the agreement whichhad come into force in March 1965 had increased costs by an average of13^ per cent for foreign-going ships ; Government circles had not welcomed the settlement, but the owners had defended it because they believed in it;it had created an entirely new wages and hours structure, and the owners hadbeen persuaded to accept it, because it had seemed right for the peculiarconditions of the industry and both sides had believed it would be oflaetinrr 1-wan**fit tn thf* inrlnctnr     Ha aler* caiH that nftpr ls**2t VA5ir&apos;c Qp.tt1(*mf*nfFIRST REPORT OF THE COURT OF INQUIRY INTO certain matters CONCERNING THE SHIPPING INDUSTRYCmnd. 3025CORRECTIONPage 11, para. 24, line 6 should read&quot; also be an increase in the overtime rate to 6s. 2d. which would give an&quot;.London: Printed and Published by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office: 196631001in cost of living and to improvements in productivity in the industry, and said that, unless there was a reduction in hours,&quot; the Owners&apos; offer would be rejected.25. At the meeting on the 24th March 1966 there was a change in theowners&apos; attitude. &apos; They were preparing to meet the new claim. TheirChairman said that direct compensation for hours worked at sea at week-ends could only be reached in steps, if costs were to he kept within bounds.He put forward alternative proposals for this purpose.

said that measures had been taken to ensure that the Agreement workedproperly.  The meeting was adjourned until the 1st February 1966.23. At the meeting of the 1st February 1966 the Chairman of theSeafarers&apos; Side said that at the meeting of the Executive Council it hadbeen decided after long discussion to present a claim for a 40-hour week at sea to be worked over 5 days within 7 days with no reduction in the consolidated basic rate, and they also requested that 12s. 6d. per month beadded to the consolidated basic pay for foreign-going Able Seamen withpro-rata increases for other ratings.  He interpreted this claim as being for normal hours of work at sea to be 8 per day Monday to Friday and anyexcess hours to be paid at overtime rates.  The Chairman of the Owners&apos;side argued at length against the claim. He said that the agreement whichhad come into force in March 1965 had increased costs by an average of13  per cent for foreign-going ships ; Government circles had not welcomed the settlement, but the owners had defended it because they believed in it;it had created an entirely new wages and hours structure, and the owners hadbeen persuaded to accept it, because it had seemed right for the peculiarconditions of the industry and both sides had believed it would be of1 lasting benefit to the industry.  He also said that after last year&apos;s settlementI costing 13^- per cent*, it was difficult to believe that only ten months laterI another very expensive claim should be presented to the owners; thei increase asked for was greatly in excess of the Governmenfs norm ; the1 Government accepted that the profitability of the shipping industry was lowI because of the severity of international competition; the industry had no\ excess profits to distribute, and successive Governments had realised theI problems of the industry; it would be impossible to sustain an increasein costs amounting to approximately 30 per cent in such a short time ;costs which could not be passed on.   Nevertheless the Chairman of theOwners&apos; Side concluded by saying that the claim would be considered bythe members and they would revert to it later.24. At the next meeting on the 9th March 1965 the Chairman of theOwners&apos; Side again argued at length against the claim, and put forward an offer that there should be an increase in the built-in compensation forweek-end work at sea; this would increase the consolidated basic rate of anAble Seaman by  1 12s. 6d. and pro rata for other ratings ; there wouldalso be an increase in the overtime rate of 6s. 2d. which would give an estimated average increase in earnings of about 3 per cent. The Chairmanof the Seafarers&apos; Side argued in favour of the claim, referring to the increasein cost of living and to improvements in productivity in the industry, and said that, unless there was a reduction in hours,&quot; the Owners&apos; offer would be rejected.25. At the meeting on the 24th March 1966 there was a change in theowners&apos; attitude. They were preparing to meet the new claim. TheirChairman said that direct compensation for hours worked at sea at week-ends could only be reached in steps, if costs were to be kept within bounds.He put forward alternative proposals for this purpose. The Seafarers&apos; Chair-man expressed a preference for one of the proposals, but asked for further concessions to be included in it.* If the home trade is included, the increase amounted to 141 per cent.
26. At the next meeting, which was on the 6th April 1966, the Ownersproduced their last offer, which incorporated two out of the three con-cessions which had been asked for. This offer, scheduled to the minutesof that meeting, was as follows:  &quot;First Stage, 1966(a) Direct overtime to be paid for all hours worked at sea on Sunday.(b) Direct overtime to be paid for all hours worked at sea on ChristmasDay, Boxing Day, New Year&apos;s Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday,Whit Monday, August Bank Holiday.(c) Voyage leave to be at the rate of 36 days a year.id) The Sunday at sea leave agreement to be withdrawn, and to bereplaced by the arrangements in (c) and (e).(e) The compensation for week-end work at present included in the consolidated basic rate to be used to provide compensation forSundays at sea, on the same basis as Saturdays at sea are com-pensated at present.(f) The consolidated basic rate (and the overtime rate) to remain as atpresent.(g) Efficient service pay, after five years&apos; service, to be increased from 5 10s. Od. per month to  6 2s. 6d. per month.Second Stage, 1967 12 months after the first stage comes into forceDirect overtime to be paid for all hours worked at sea on Saturdayafternoon, and for all hours worked in excess of four on Saturdaymornings.Third Stage, 1968 12 months after the second stage comes into forceDirect overtime to be paid for all hours worked at sea on Saturdaymornings.The new wages, hours and leave Agreement is to cover a period ofapproximately three years from the date on which it first comes intooperation. However, if there is some dramatic change in circumstances,such as an extraordinary increase in the cost of living (i.e. an increaseabove what has been customary over the last few years) the owners would be prepared to discuss the Agreement further with the N.U.S.&quot;27. What was the effect of that offer? It involved very extensiveconcessions: - (a) Payment was to be made on the basis of a 40-hour week both inport and at sea.(b) There was to be overtime pay for all Saturday and Sunday working at sea, although the basic rate had in March 1965 been enlargedby the inclusion of a compounded compensation to the men for notreceiving overtime pay for Saturday and Sunday working at sea and the basic rate was to be retained unaltered.(c) The 1965 agreement had involved an increase of about 14J per centin the industry&apos;s wage bill, and the agreement proposed by this offer was estimated to involve another 13 per cent increase (though it
has now been ascertained that 12J per cent would be a more accurate estimate).id) The reduction in ordinary hours worked at the week-end at seawould be implemented as to 50 per cent forthwith, as to 25 percent in a year&apos;s time, and as to the remaining 25 per cent one yearlater. It should be added that the cost in the first year would bepartly offset by a reduction in the number of paid holidays.28. The meeting of the 6th April 1966 ended with a statement by theChairman of the Seafarers&apos; Side that, now that the leave question had beenclarified, his side would be prepared unanimously to recommend their executive to accept the Owners&apos; proposals.29. The N.U.S. Executive Council, however, decided differently. On the14th April 1966 the Owners were informed that their offer had been rejectedand they were asked whether they could improve it. The Owners repliedorally in these terms:  &quot; Our 6th April offer gave one way of substituting direct overtimepayment for week-end at sea, instead of the present built-in com-pensation. If you wish to investigate some alternative way of achievingyour objective or some way of adjusting our 6th April offer but inany event within the cost limits of that offer, we would be quite willingto do that with you &quot;.There was no response to this invitation.On the 18th April 1966 the N.U.S. wrote to the Owners as follows:  &quot; Further to our telephone conversation of the 14th and 15th instant,I would confirm that the Executive Council of this Union rejected theOwners&apos; offer of 6th April in answer to our claim for a reduction inthe weekly hours of work at sea and wage increase of 12s. 6d. per month.I would also confirm that in order to achieve an offer acceptable tothem, the Executive Council took the decision to advise our membershipnot to sign Articles of Agreement on and after 16th May 1966.&quot;And so the strike was called.Costs30. In considering the proposals of the two sides we looked closely atthe figures of costs which had been put before us. After discussion,general agreement was reached that certain revisions were necessary, mainly because the original figures related to foreign-going vessels only. Conse-quently, the figure of 17 per cent for the claim becomes 15J per cent andthe figure of 13 per cent for the offer (divided into three stages) becomes12J per cent. These agreed estimates are made on the assumption that hourspaid would remain the same after the proposals were put into effect as theyare now. This assumption is also open to question.31. Both the N.US. claim and the owners&apos; offer (when the stages are completed) provide for the payment at overtime rates of all hours workedon Saturday and Sunday, whereas under the present agreement the monthlyrate includes a compensatory payment for eight &quot;ordinary hours&quot; on both
Saturdays and Sundays at sea whether worked or not. Thus both theclaim and the offer provide for the payment of sixteen extra hours a week at overtime rates while at sea, provided those hours are worked. Theowners&apos; calculation of costs is based on the assumption that they will all be worked. But this assumption cannot be entirely accepted, for in theirwritten evidence the owners asserted that, prior to March 1965 when&quot; ordinary hours &quot; at sea were paid at overtime rates (as they will be infuture if either the claim or the offer is accepted) &quot; there was pressure from day workers (non-watchkeepers) to be worked at the weekend.&quot; Conse-quently there must be some saving here to offset the cost.32. How great a saving can be expected? The owners told us that itwill be negligible, since 88 per cent of ratings are either watchkeepers orin the catering department, and must work through the weekends just ason any other day ; consequently there remains only 12 per cent of day workers on deck or in the engine room to contribute to the saving. The N.U.S., onthe other hand thought the figure of 12 per cent for day workers was too low and insisted that greater savings could be expected. One instance whichthey put to us was a passenger ship not fully booked for part of the voyage,so that it would be possible to give the catering staff time off at weekends.Since the cost of paying sixteen additional hours at sea at overtime ratesis 14-5 per cent of the total wage bill, each hour saved on average throughoutthe industry as a whole would reduce the cost by 14-5 &quot;4- 16 - 0-9 per cent,so that, for example, a saving of four hours per man would cut the costfrom 14-5 per cent to just under 11 per cent. It is only fair to say, however,that the owners regard such a saving as quite beyond the limits of possibility.33. There is, however, another consideration. According to the census of hours worked in the industry on which all the owners&apos; cost figures are based, seamen on foreign-going ships average 66 hours of work a week, andthose in the Home Trade average 73-6 hours. Quite apart from weekendhours at sea compensated by basic pay under the 1965 agreement, ratings onforeign-going vessels worked 795-5 hours overtime on average per year. Thisamounts to 15-  hours of overtime a week over and above a fifty-six hour week at sea, and a forty hour week in part. For Home Trade ratings thefigure is on average 1343-3 hours per year, or nearly 26 overtime hours aweek over and above a fifty-six hour week at sea and forty hours in port.By any standard these figures are high.34. It must be admitted that there are special reasons for high figures of overtime at sea. Few diversions are available and a man cannot spend hisleisure hours with his family. He is therefore more willing to work longhours than the worker on land, for by doing so he can store up overtime payagainst his leave. From the owner&apos;s point of view a good deal of maintenancecan be carried out in these hours more economically than on land. Even so,these figures would seem to offer some opportunity for saving. At this pointalso the evidence which we heard was in conflict. The owners believed that* no more than marginal savings were possible. The representatives of the seamen thought that reorganisation of work could yield substantial cuts inovertime,35. There is another reason for supposing that overtime can be reduced.Although there are difficulties, which the owners pointed out to us, in
making comparisons between the pay of British seamen and those of other nations, there can be no doubt that standards of remuneration in Germany,Holland and Scandinavian countries are in most respects higherthan in Britain. If their shipping industries remain competitive in spiteof this, the explanation must be that either their manning scales are lower,or they keep overtime under better control. Although no figures are available,the owners think that the latter is the probable explanation; and it is supported by the well-established fact that levels of overtime on the Continentin industry generally, except in France, are below that of Britain.36. We have therefore come to the conclusion that it would be possiblefor the industry to make a contribution towards the cost of the introductionof the forty-hour week at sea both by reducing time on duty at sea during&quot; ordinary hours&quot; at the weekend, and by reducing overtime outside&quot; ordinary hours &quot;. A saving of an hour a week overall both at sea and inport would cut labour costs by about 1J per cent. We think a saving oftwo hours a week over the next twelve months is well within the industry&apos;capacity. Such a saving will not come about of itself. It will not be accomplished unless the owners abandon their belief that nothing can be done about it; and its achievement can be greatly assisted by the co-operation ofthe union. We suggest that both sides should commit themselves to this target; that each company should prepare its own plans for rearranging workon its ships to make its contribution to the total; and that a national jointcommittee should approve the plans and, if necessary, assist over any difficulties that may arise in its implementation.37. These plans must not in any way interfere with the right of the master to instruct men to work overtime when he thinks fit. This authority is essential for the safety of the vessel, and to deal with emergencies.38. We heard evidence from both sides concerning the possibility of reducing costs on certain types of vessel by using crews more flexibly in orderto save manpower. One means of accomplishing this is interchangeability ofratings between deck and engine room; another more radical proposal is fora &quot;general purpose&quot; crew. At the moment negotiations on this topic areat a standstill. Although we propose to deal with this subject more fully in our final report, we have no doubt that important economies are attainable,and recommend that talks be resumed as soon as possible. We do not,however, think that they can lead during the next twelve months to generalsavings sufficient to contribute an appreciable offset against the cost of the changes which we propose.Conclusions39. It is important to note that at the time of the breakdown of thenegotiations the N.U.S. made no counter-offer to the owners&apos; proposals. Itis true that they had initially at the meeting of the Panels on 1st February1966, presented a claim for a 40 hour week at sea to be worked in 5 dayswithin 7 days (interpreted by the Chairman of their side as Monday toFriday) with no reduction in the consolidated basic rate, and for 12s. 6d. amonth to be added. This claim however was accepted by the owners inprinciple and embodied in the owners&apos; offer of the 6th April 1966 but
for implementation over a period of two years. The Executive Council ofthe N.U.S. rejected that offer, hut made no counter-offer. It would seem that they intended to wait and see what increased offer would be forth-coming from the owners, and then to decide whether to accept or rejeot it.There was no opportunity for the owners to ascertain and consider whatthe Executive Council were prepared to accept. This would have beenmerely an unhelpful attitude on the part of the Executive Council, and notin any way disastrous, if they had not used the strike weapon. without making any attempt to carry negotiations any further they called a strike.There is no need to infer that the Executive Council wished to have a strikefor the sake of having a strike or from any sinister motive. It is not likely that they would set out to cause grave damage to their own industry withresulting ultimate loss to the members of the N.U.S. The ExecutiveCouncil were, however, calling a strike on the assumption that they would get their own way that the owners, after all the concessions which theyhad made and offered, would eventually under pressure from the strikethreat offer more. That was not a safe assumption as the owners had saidtheir offer was final and they might take their stand on that. In our view the Executive Council were not justified in using the strike weapon withoutfurther attempts to resolve the position, because there was nothing to call for the use of this very drastic and dangerous remedy. There was noremaining issue of principle; there were only questions as to the terms ofthe offer. Their members were not suffering hardship. There had been a major and costly improvement in seamen&apos;s wages in March 1965, and numerous minor benefits gained, and now in 1966 there is another majorcostly improvement offered.40. The owners&apos; side stood firm on their last offer. In our view this wasin the circumstances not an unreasonable attitude, because they had already made and offered so much, and also they had to bear in mind the national interest.41. Now there is a complete deadlock between the parties, with both ofthem standing firmly in the positions which they have taken up. Theowners have made their last offer and cannot, consistently with what theyhave said, make any advance on it of their own accord. The ExecutiveCouncil have rejected the owners&apos; last offer and are waiting for a further offer to follow it. There is no way out of the impasse unless some third partymakes proposals. It is to be noted that the owners have not withdrawntheir offer. It is common ground between the parties that the forty hour weekshould be introduced, and that the compensatory element which was includedin the basic rate to compensate for Saturday and Sunday working at seashould be retained. We have therefore concerned ourselves principally withthe outstanding question of timing, and feel that in the circumstances it is right for the Court of Inquiry to offer proposals which might resolve the deadlock. We have considered the objection that any further concession,coming on top of those already made, must be damaging to the national interest. We shall in a later paragraph deal with questions of percentage costs in this connexion.42. We have as explained in paragraphs 30-38, found certain elementsand factors which have not been taken into consideration by the two sides,
and these, we feel, can be used to make the owners&apos; offer more acceptablewithout materially increasing the cost of it. We have taken soundingsboth in private oral hearings, with representatives of both parties present,and in separate discussions with representatives of each party. We did not ask them to agree anything or accept anything, as they might not be ableto do this without consultation with those whom they represent. But wehave ascertained that the parties are not immovably fixed in the positionswhich they have adopted, and that proposals will be carefully considered.43. Accordingly we propose certain amendments in the Employers&apos; offer which we have set out above in paragraph 25. The main point is tointroduce the forty-hour week at sea over twelve months instead of two years.(i) In paragraph (c) we think the figure 36 is on the low side and shouldbe raised to 39. At present there are 16 days of standard paidleave plus one day for each Sunday or public holiday (out of the seven specified public holidays) spent at sea. The average numberof Sundays spent at sea is 37 per annum for foreign-going vessels and 27 per annum for home trade vessels. The &quot;reduction to 36might be too severe, although it is right to make a substantial reduction to provide a partial offset to the increased cost resultingfrom other parts of the offer.(ii) In paragraph (e) we do not propose any change in the amounts of the compounded compensation items included in the consoli-dated basic rate, but we suggest a change in the description.Spending Sundays and public holidays at sea is one of the manyelements of seafaring life, which are to be considered as a wholein fixing the extent of the paid leave. It is not appropriate to allocate a particular item of remuneration to a particular element.Although the compensation for work on Saturdays and Sundays at sea has been consolidated into the basic rate, it must not be overlooked that it is part of the remuneration for suoh workadditional to the payments at the overtime rate.(iii) The 12s. 6d. provided for in paragraph (g) should be omitted.This provides a small offset to the increased costs resulting fromother partsi of the offer.(iv) At the second stage, coming in 1967 twelve months after the first stage, there should be the full reduction in hours from 48 to 40 sothat overtime pay will be given for all hours worked on Saturday.We think this acceleration of the implementation of the 40 hour week will be specially welcome to the N.U.S. and its members.(v) It follows that there will be no third stage.(vi) The new wages, hours and leave agreement should cover a periodof two years, instead of three years, from the date on which it comes into operation.44. To make sure that our proposals are clear, we set out the amendedoffer which would result from our amendments to the owners&apos; offer of the6th April 1966:-First Stage, 1966(a) Direct overtime to be paid for all hours worked at sea on Sunday.
(b) Direct overtime to be paid for all hours worked at sea on ChristmasDay, Boxing Day, New Year&apos;s Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday,Whit Monday, August Bank Holiday.(c) Voyage leave to be at the rate of 39 days a year.(d) The Sunday at sea leave agreement to be withdrawn, and to bereplaced by the arrangements in (c) and (e).(e) The compensation for week-end work at present included in the consolidated basic rate to be retained as remuneration (in additionto overtime payments) for working on Saturdays and Sundays at sea.(f) The consolidated basic rate and the overtime rate to remain as atpresent.Second Stage, 1967 12 months after the first stage comes into forceDirect overtime to be paid for all hours worked at sea on Saturdays.The new wages, hours and leave Agreement is to cover a period oftwo years from the date on which it first comes into operation.However if there is some dramatic change in circumstances, such as an extraordinary increase in the cost of living (i.e. an increase above what has been customary over the last five years) the owners would beprepared to discuss the Agreement further with the N.U.S.45. Given that the industry accepts our target of a reduction of two hours overtime a week within the next twelve months, the total costof both stages of our proposals would be very close to those of the first two stages of the owners&apos; offer. The agreed costs are now somewhat lower than the owners originally supposed. Because of this and our exclusion ofthe proposed increase of 12s. 6d. a month, it is possible to increase thenumber of days&apos; leave from the 36 a year contained in the owners&apos; offer to 39 a year and still leave the cost of this, stage at a little under 5 per cent.We have amalgamated the second and third stages of the owners&apos; offer,which on their original estimate was to have cost 8 per cent. Because ofthe agreed reduction in total costs, and allowing for a saving of two hoursof overtime, this now becomes about 4-J per cent. The total cost of intro-ducing the full 40 hour week at sea therefore becomes 9J per cent over twoyears.46. Finally, we must record our thanks to our Secretary, Mr. D. B. Smith,and his assistant, Mr. M. Emmott, for their help in this the first stage ofour inquiry.(31001)  Dd. 128719 K60  6/66  St.S.
