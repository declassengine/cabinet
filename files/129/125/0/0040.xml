IS:(66) 90 COPY NO.27th June, 1966CABINETTHE CONCORD PROJECTMemorandum by the Attorney-general in November, 1964, in E.D.(64) 23 I made the following main points on the legal aspects of the Concord Agreement, and in particular the United Kingdom&apos;s obligations under it -(i)  the Agreement is an international treaty, enforceable as such bythe International Court of Justice;(ii)  the Agreement contains no express or implied provision permittingunilateral withdrawal from it;(iii)  if we were to repudiate, or fail to comply with, our obligations,we would be liable to be taken before the International Court;and(iv)  we would then face the possibility that the Court would make anorder that we should pay compensation to the French, possiblyamounting to the additional cost to France of having to complete the Concord project without our assistance.    At that time theestimate of the possible compensation was  140 million;  itcould now amount to well over  200 million.2.      Following the Report of the Committee of Officials dated 13th May,1966, I have reviewed our legal position under the Agreement.    In viewof the mounting and enormous cost of the project, I have considered, inconsultation with Sir Humphrey Waldock, QC, the leading authority inthis field, whether there is any legally defensible way of terminating the concord project against the wishes of the French, or alternatively of limiting the United Kingdom liability under it.     Two particular questionsarise, namely -(a) does the large escalation in the cost of the project itselfconstitute a legal ground which would justify us in withdrawing from it;  and(b) can any &quot;let-out&quot; or other relieving clause be implied fromthe terms of the Agreement and/or the Arrangement of29th November, 1962, between the two countries ?-1-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF KER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
3.     As to the first of these questions, we have come to the firmconclusion   that the escalation in the cost does not amount to such a fundamental change in the circumstances as would in law justify theUnited Kingdom in withdrawing from the project.      A fundamental change of circumstances can in some cases entitle one party to with-draw from an agreement;   but this can only be where the change wasone not foreseen by the parties and where the circumstances whichhave changed constituted an essential basis of the consent of theparties to be bound by the Treaty;   and further, the effect of thechange must be radically to transform the scope of the obligationsstill to be performed under the treaty.     In our view, it would not beheld by the International Court that the escalation in the cost of the project amounted to such a fundamental change.    In particular, itwould be very difficult to argue that the United Kingdom in entering into the Treaty did not foresee the possibility of a considerable increase in the cost of developing and producing an entirely new kindof aircraft.    Further, the acceptance, as the project has proceeded,of the various reports by the Committee of Officials would lend weight to the probable French contention that we had confirmed our willingness to proceed with the project despite the increase in costs.4.     As to the second question, similar considerations apply.    Theevidently speculative and finance-absorbing character of the project and the evidence of the subsequent approval given by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to the increase in costs make it unlikely that the court would accept that there was any implied understanding in theAgreement that there should be a limit to the extent of our financialobligation thereunder,    We have come to the conclusion that theCourt would be unlikely to accept any such argument by the UnitedKingdom.5.     We have also considered the position of the Standing Committeeof Officials, and its relationship to Her Majesty&apos;s Government.    Itmight perhaps be arguable that the provision in the Agreement for thecreation of the Standing Committee with specific responsibility forproposing measures designed to secure economy and for making recommendations on all matters affecting the preparation of thenational estimates and accounts enable Her Majesty*s Government toretain control of the cost of the project.      But this argument is not, inmy view, very helpful, as we are still thrown back on the financial commitments of the two Governments to each other under theAgreement.    &quot;When the United Kingdom Government comes to considerthe recommendations of the Standing Committee, it cannot decide to approve or disapprove them simply by reference to its own financialviews, and must respect its commitments to France.    We may objectto items which we consider unnecessary or outside the scope of the project,    But any rejection of items within the scope of the project,and generally regarded by both, aides of the Official Committee asneeded for its success, would expose us to a charge of breaking faithwith our commitments to the French Government.    In other words,Her Majesty&apos;s Government may disapprove the recommendations, but our disapproval could well be interpreted as a withdrawal from ourc ommitm ent.-2-GOMFBDENTIAfc
6.      In my opinion, therefore, there is at present no legallydefensible way of withdrawing from our obligation under the Agreement,or of placing a limit on our financial liability under it.    I am thereforestill of the opinion that if we were to seek to withdraw from the Treatywe would face the risk of proceedings in the International Court ofJustice, which could order us to compensate the French for theadditional cost of having to complete the project on their own.F.
