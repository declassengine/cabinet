THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1966C(66) 81 Copy No.16th June, 1966CABINETPRICES AND INCOMES policy memorandum by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic affairs since we took office in October 1964 we have been developing a policy for productivity, prices and incomes which is designed,on the basis of co-operation and agreement with representative bodies on both sides of industry, to bring about a gradual butpermanent improvement in the prices and incomes situation. I havebeen discussing with my colleagues in the Ministerial Committeefor Prices and Incomes what action we should take to meet thefact that the policy has so far proved less immediately effective than our economic situation requires. In this paper I suggestcertain ways in which we should, in my view, urgently seek tomake the policy more effective. In separate papers I discuss anumber of possible improvements in the machinery for pay reviews,arbitration, etc. (C (66) 82) and seek the agreement of the Cabinetto a revised Prices and Incomes Bill (C (66) 80). Although these papers are not intended to commit my colleagues, I havenevertheless tried in them to reflect the main points made in our discussion (PI (66) 2nd Meeting).Prices and incomes freeze or standstill2. It has been suggested in various quarters that our present economic difficulties could best be secured by the shock treatmentof a temporary but general &quot; freeze &quot; or standstill of prices- and incomes. Hardly anyone suggests that this could be done on a statutory basis; it would have to be voluntary. What would be involved would be a call on all business, trade and industrial undertakings (private and public) to hold their prices steady for aperiod, and similarly on all employers and trade unions to observea pay standstill for the same period.3. This is not an idea that one ought to dismiss out of hand.It may well be true that we could secure quite a large number of undertakings in this sense. But the difficulty is that no voluntary arrangements of this sort could hope to be watertight.   On the6959
prices side we should have to agree that prices of seasonal foodsand imported materials would continue to fluctuate. In additionsome price increases might have to be accepted in order to avoidcausing exceptional hardship to particular firms; and for one reason or another good or bad many prices would in practiceundoubtedly continue to rise. This would lead to complaints ofunfairness from firms which were holding their prices and fromworkers and trade unions who were maintaining the standstill in pay.4. On the pay side, it would be necessary to secure defermentof increases due under existing agreements (including cost of livingsliding scale agreements) as well as of increases arising fromnegotiations, statutory wage-fixing bodies and arbitration bodies.The Government would have to be particularly punctilious in getting a complete standstill in the public sector. But again the standstill would be bound to be undermined. For example itcould not be enforced at work-place, site or factory level and itcould hardly be expected to override an employees contractualcommitments. All this in particular the deferment of forwardcommitments would arouse bitter opposition and there would bea very serious risk of the familiar situation in which theGovernment was obliged to apply a rigorous standstill in the caseof public servants, while its request went unobserved over large areas of the private sector.5. I do not think that this situation would be tolerable or indeed that a standstill of this type provides the answer to ourpresent problems. At best I do not think that we could expect tohold it for more than about six months, even if we had the supportof the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and Confederation of BritishIndustries (CBI). While a six months&apos; breathing space would admittedly have some advantages, they would in my view beoutweighed by two major disadvantages; first that the pressureswhich would build up during the standstill would result in a spateof increases as soon as it was over on a scale which would undowhatever good we had achieved; and secondly that theco-operation of the TUC and CBI would be strained to an extent which would make it difficult, if not impossible, to resume thejoint search with them for an effective long-term policy.6. But there are other ways in which we can further develop and strengthen the policy without the drawbacks of a generalstandstill discussed above.Prices and Incomes Bill7. We must press ahead with the Bill. This is discussed inC (66) 80.Early-warning arrangements8. The voluntary early-warning system is now workingreasonably well and I am grateful to those of my colleagues whohave helped to secure its introduction.   But there are still two
respects in which the arrangements fall far short of what is needed:(i) It has always been clear that the Government cannotimplement the policy single-handed. We must look tothe TUC and the CBI to give their members a firm lead.The TUC have made a promising start by introducingtheir own early-warning and vetting procedures; the cbi are moving more slowly but will, I hope, develop in time along the same lines. I have arranged to meetthe leaders on both sides regularly to discuss the main problems as they arise and shall use this as a means of keeping pressure on them to extend their influence and activities.(ii) But the discipline of the early-warning system will only be effective if there lies behind it the possibility ofreference to the NBPI. The Board has, in my view,maintained a commendably high level of analysis andcomment in its reports. But we must step up the level ofits work and I look to my colleagues for help in selecting appropriate cases.Development of the White Paper principles9. Although the general principles laid down in the white paper on Prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd. 2639) in April 1965have not so far been seriously challenged, there are some respects in which we need to clarify, amplify or develop them. Forexample:(i) We need to secure wider recognition that we cannot at thepresent time afford any further reduction in the standardworking week (below 40 hours) or general lengtheningof holidays in addition to increases in rates of pay.(ii) Attempts to secure improvements in pay or hours (or both) at increasingly shorter intervals must be resisted.12 months should be a minimum period betweensettlements.(iii) In some cases an exceptional pay increase will be justified by special circumstances of the type discussed in theWhite Paper. But even then it may be necessary tophase the increase rather than implement it in a singlestep.Improvements in machinery for pay reviews, arbitration, etc.10. The effectiveness of the policy is still handicapped by someof , the institutional arrangements. A number of possible improvements are discussed in C (66) 82.Social considerations11. Although I have expressed my views mainly in terms of strengthening the economic effectiveness of the prices and incomes policy, I am deeply conscious of the importance of the social
implications in what we are trying to achieve. We are bound todevelop the policy, so far as we can, in a way which accords withour general political and social beliefs. And it is in any case clearthat no incomes policy can work on a voluntary basis (and it is unlikely to work on any other basis) unless it is broadly acceptedthroughout the working population as both sensible and fair. Thereis no simple answer to this problem; we need to tackle it in anumber of ways simultaneously. We need to put more substanceinto the principle in Cmnd. 2639 that the lowest-paid workers can reasonably expect more than the better paid. We need to make itclear that the policy applies as much to the professions and otherhighly-paid people as to the wage-earner. (I should like to seemore cases of this sort referred to the National Board for prices and Incomes.) The problem would, of course, be eased if it were possible, as is sometimes suggested, to develop techniques forassessing on some objective and generally acceptable basis theappropriate level of pay for any particular work. I have no doubtthat there is scope for the development of such techniques and wemust do what we can to develop them. But it would be rash toassume that this will provide a solution in the short term.12. My general conclusion, therefore, is that we should intensifyour efforts to develop the policy on a basis of agreement andco-operation. If the Cabinet agree, I propose, in consultation with my colleagues most closely concerned, to try to reach agreementwith the main representative organisations on a further statementof principles covering these points. Many of them are of special interest to public servants whose staff organisations are notaffiliated to the TUC and we shall need at the appropriate moment to consult the more important bodies of this type as well as the tuc.G.
