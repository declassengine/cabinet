I:      introduction the rapid development and mass production of the motor vehicle over the past 20 years has &quot;brought immense benefits to millions of people:    increased mobility, a fuller sociallife, family enjoyment, new experiences. It has alsoproduced new, quick and convenient means of moving goods.But at the same time it has brought severe discomforts:congestion in the streets of our towns;    the misery of the journey to work for commuters;    noise, fumes and danger asthe setting of our lives;    a rising trend of casualties onour roads and a threat to our environment in both town and country-side which, if it continues unchecked, will ensurethat the pleasure and benefit for which we use the car willincreasingly elude us.   The aim of a rational transport policy must be to solve this paradox.2.     The nation has not yet begun to face up to the implications of the motor age   Each of us still believes hecan find his own individual means of escape from theaccompanying unpleasantness;    for example, by finding a house further afield and &quot;buying a car - or cars - to enable him and his family to get to it0    In the context of suchimpulses transport policy would have only one aim:    to &quot;buildmore routes for the private car.   And it would find its economic justification in the fact that goods would bemoving by the same routes,3.     The problem of the motor vehicle has been intensified&quot;because it has &quot;been thrust, unplanned, on the environment wehave inherited from a very different age.   We have been slow to realise that the expansion of motor traffic on thepresent scale calls either for a completely new kind of physical environment or for a willingness to adapt its use to the sort of conditions in which we want to live.Countries which &quot;became &quot;motorised1-1 earlier than Britain arejust &quot;beginning to face up to this truth.
Ij..     Even if we had as a nation consciously chosen the first of these two courses, which we h...ve not, it would be atpresent beyond our means.   New towns can be built to therequirements of the motor age though, even then, they willnot necessarily be the sort of towns we want if they arebuilt on the assumption of total dependence on privatetransport.   But most of us live in towns built a century ormore ago and the cost of adapting them to take hundreds of thousands of cars is prohibitive.    Some adaptation must clearly be made but, inevitably, it can only be slow.5.     The same problem faces us on inter-urban roads.   TodayBritain is spending more on new and improved roads than atany time in her history:    the amount for 1966 will be ninetimes what it was even 10 years ago.   Yet so explosive hasbeen the expansion of traffic that by 1970 50% more of our major trunk roads will be heavily over-loaded than aretoday - the legacy of years of neglect.6.     In such a situations two courses are clearly necessary.The first is to give the country&apos;s transport needs the priority they require, not only in the allocation of money,but in their relationship to other developments.   Until very recently we have not even attempted in this country to plan as a whole the factors which create our environment:industry, housing and transport;    or to plan different formsof transport in relation to each other.    Indeed, until thenecessary national and regional planning machinery was created, this was impossible.7.     Since Britain&apos;s resources are limited, it is imperative that they should be used to the best effect:    in other words, industries should not be built without their communications, ports without the means of moving the goods to and from them or houses without adequate roads.Transport must be planned as part of the national effort asa whole and of the regional contributions to that effort.
8.     The second requirement is to face up to the role ofpublic transport.   Our towns and cities will never be ableto cope with their traffic, or the transport needs ofmillions of people, without strengthening, improving and expanding their public transport services.   Nor can we afford to under-estimate, as we have been doing, the valuable contribution which the railways can make in moving goods and passengers from town to town and people to and from work.Clearly these services must adapt themselves to newtechnological developments but to get more people and goodsmoved with less use of road space is vital to the solutionof our transport problem.9.     New thinking is required, not only about types andcombinations of public transport, but also about how theyshould be financed.   To attempt to solve these problems inexclusively commercial terms is to &quot;bring the Victorianmentality to the solution of modern needs.   Those who manageor work on London Transport, British Railways and provincialbus services are struggling to reconcile two mutuallycontradictory objectives:    to provide an adequate service for the public and to pay their way.   As a result they are finding it increasingly difficult to do either.   Thesolution will call for radical changes in the 1962 transport act.10.    It will also call for structural changes.   If thepublic sector of transport is to play its important roleeffectively, its road and rail elements can no longeroperate in isolation.   But the new forms of organisationmust take account of modern developments.    On the freightside this calls for a nationally planned and integratedroad-rail service designed to take full advantage of thenew techniques for handling freight.   Passenger services,on the other hand, must be adapted to local needs.    The
\\- k -r* (T\ ivi cmc svi*t&quot;i a surgent need for integration is now emerging from thepractical experience of transport problems in differentlocalities.   The ways of ensuring this integration, and the forms it should take, are being discussed with the Regional -Economic Planning Councils and local authorities.11,   The key to solving Britain&apos;s transport problems,therefore, lies in planning designed to reconcile ourmany-sided needs, national and regional, economic and social.If we are to live within our means, while developing modern,efficient transport systems, and drawing full enjoyment fromthe motor car, we must put all our resources to their best use as part of a coherent and integrated whole.   This paperoutlines what is being done.
5.II:    BRITISH RAILWAYS - A NIL/ POLICY * X1.     This country has an extensive network of railways,with the capacity to provide fast,  safe and reliableservices for passengers and goods.    It already offers,by comparison with roads, a very high ratio of trafficcapacity to track area;    and there is ample scope for technical development to higher capacity at higher speeds,without increased use of land.2.,    To make sure that the railways can play their part tobest effect in a planned transport system the Governmenthas made a fundamental review of policy.    The developmentof road transport and continuing industrial evolution havemade it necessary for the railways to specialise.   Equally,these developments have emphasized the need to save roadspace and congestion costs by making the fullest use of railways where they can give efficient service, as inthe trunking of freight inter-city passenger journeys, andtravel to work in the major conurbations,3.    The touchstone of a sound railway policy is the extentto which it meets the country1s overall transport needs.Commercial viability is important, but secondary.   Under theTransport Act 1962 the link between nationalised road and rail transport was broken and the new Railways Board wasgiven the task, as a separate corporate &quot;body, of &quot;breakingeven&quot; as soon as possible.   Such a target could only beachieved by paring down the railway system to a degree whichwould be socially and economically unacceptable.    In practicesuccessive governments have intervened to prevent closureswhich were obviously harmful to national and local needs.h.    The provisions of the 1962 Act have vitiated much ofthe good work which the new Railways Board has done.   Usefulprogress was made under Lord Beoching in identifying theroles v/hich the modern railway can best perform and in/ relating
relating investment and. marketing policies to them.Practical results were seen in the rationalisation of passenger and freight services, the accelerated replace-ment of steam by diesel and electric traction, improvements in the control of the wagon and coaching fleets and thedevelopment in conjunction with trade and industry of newtransport conceptions such as the Freightliner and&quot;merry-go-round&quot; services.    But the Board was given noproper yardstick, statutory or otherwise, for measuringthe effectiveness of the railway system against the realnational requirement.    Too little account hod &quot;been takenin the Act of the interrelation of the railways withother forms of transport and of economic and environmentalneeds, whether national or regional.5.    It is now widely recognised that the railway systemcannot play its proper role in the economy of the countryand also comply with the Transport Act 1962.    The Act ledInevitably to the pursit of successive reductions in rail ser-vices regardless of wider considerations.    Moreover thisprogressive reduction appeared a never-ending process, with a depressing effect on the morale of management and men       the opposite of what is required for a Jiealty, efficient industry.6.    The right way forward is to decide now what is to &quot;bethe new role of the railway system in our society,  to amend the relevant statutory and financial provisions accordingly,and to restore stability to the industry so that management and men can concentrate on carrying out that new role withmaximum efficiency.Shape and Size of the Future Railway System7.   For the foreseeable future, the country&apos;s transport system must include a substantial railway network.8.    In most spheres the railways can he expected tocontinue to operate on a commercial basis.   For example,/ over
over a wide range of long-distance bulk haulage, on fastinter-city passenger services, and on some of the more heavily used commuter services, ther..: is no reason whyan efficient rail ay should not attract an expanding volumeof traffic at rates which reflect the true cost of providing the services.    There are other services, however, whichhave little or no prospect of becoming directly remunerative,in a commercial sense, on the basis of revenue from users,at least until a more sensible framework for urban transportcan be established;    yet their value to the communityoutweighs their accounting cost to the railways.    Thesesocially necessary services include many commuter services in conurbations, whose closure would add to road congestioncosts, and some services in remote areas where reasonablealternatives are impracticable or excessively costly.9.    The first problem is to determine the size and shape of the basic system to meet both commercial and socialneeds.   It is already clear from discussions between theMinister and the Railways Board that no network which theBoard would consider commercially and operationally viablewithin its present terms of reference could be achieved-without further extensive closures of socially necessarylines.    On the other hand it is essential to enablemanagement to concentrate on the improvement ratherthan the reduction of the basic system,  so as to providea first class service to the public, trade and industry?and to give railwayman the incentive of an assured andworthwhile future.   The Government has therefore decided,in order to restore stability to the industry, that thegeneral shape and size of the system must be determinednow, and that it should include:       t I(a)    a network of main trunk routes selected forspecial development linking the main centres of population, industry and commerce;/ (b)
(b) secondary lines feeding the trunk network,including some to be developed to carryparticularly h ,avy flows of freight;(c) certain commuter routes in and around the maincities and conurbationsj(d) certain lin^s essential to the life of remoteareas.The detailed proposals discussed between the Government andthe Board are now being considered by the Regional economic planning Councils, and as soon as possible particulars ofthe proposed basic network will be published.    The future of%    some of the lines retained for certain freight flows would,of course, have to be reconsidered if the source of the traffic disappeared or if there should be a major changein their circumstances.10.    The result will be a considerably larger system thanseemed likely with the previous policy of widespreadclosure.   This change reflects a revised assessment by theBoard of traffic uotential and the associated operational requirements, as well as a recognition of the importanceof the contribution of the railways to broader planning for society as a whole.    It will, nevertheless, involve some further closures beyond, those already announced, since thereis some pruning still to be done before the system is brought up to date.   New proposals are likely to include,for complete closure, around UOO route miles now carryingpassenger services and around 1,330 miles darrying freightonly:    but the basic network will still be very substantial.11.    The Governments decision that there should be abasic continuing network of the general size and shapeindicated will not finally settle the future of any linenot included in it, or prejudge the decision on the closure of a particular pnssenger services.    Each of these will go/through
through the normal procedures,  including consultation withthe Regional &quot;Economic Planning Councils.    Any redundancythat may result from the limited number of further closureswill bo mitigated by the comprehensive agreements between management and staff which provide for the transfer,resettlement and retraining of the men concerned, and for compensation payments in those cases where men leave therailways service.    These arrangements are workingsuccessfully but in some cases men whose jobs are threatened have been left in a state of uncertaintythrough delays over passenger closure decisions.    decisions on closures which substantially affect the personal futureof railwayman will be taken,  one way or the other, as quickly as possible.12.    Where however it appears that services might In futurehave to be reinstated on a closed line - for instance as aresult of planned movement of population and industry -the Government will ensure that the route is preservedmeantime, even if the actual track is removed;,  so thatthere will be no physical obstacle to reopening.Future Development13.   Attention can now bu concentrated on the improvementof the part of the system to be retained.    This has two principle aspects which are closely linked:First,  the need to ensure that the best possible use is made of the lines which are to continue in being.    To this end road and rail services must be re-integrated.    The necessary developments in urban and freight transport are described in chapters IV and VI. e.Second, the development of the network as necessaryto enable it to carry the traffic efficiently./For
For this latter purpose the Government will makes   available, on a proper economic basis, and within the generallimits imposed on public sector investment, the capitalneeded for the replacement of obsolete by modern rolling stock, the continued modernisation of track and signalling,and other necessary investment.      It will have very muchin mind the need to concentrate long-term investment onthe major trunk routes, while undertaking works required on other routes for their efficient and economical use asfeeder lines, commuter routes and so on.     The Governmentwill continue to discuss with the Railways Board both its general programmes for investment and appopriate methods of investment appraisal.      It will take particular account ofthe need to consider investment in all forms of transporttogether and in the context of regional economic planning.These developments will not by themselves provide the efficient, cheap and reliable services needed to enable themto attract the traffic to which they are basically suited.This demands the full co-operation of men and management at all levels in the improvement of services and the raising of productivity.      The Government is deeply conscious of thedifficulties of the past v/hich, in the atmosphere of an unstableand declining industry, have inhibited the fullest co-operationamong all concerned.     The new atmosphere v/hich these proposals will engender should do much to overcome this difficulty.But the Government is also taking more specific steps.     ThePrime&quot;Minister has met representatives of the Railways Boardand of the unions to launch a review of the structure of rail-way pay, measures to increase productivity and efficiency, andthe machinery of negotiation and consultation within theindustry.     As then agreed, detailed talks are now   takingplace under the chairmanship of the Minister of Labour./ Financial
Financial Provisions15.    The Government intends to introduce a new system underwhich the Board will be relieved of the burden at presentplaced on its accounts by any unremunerative but sociallynecessary services which, with the Governments agreement,it continues to maintain.    These will comprise more than thosepassenger services to whose closure consent has been refusedunder Section 56 of the Transport Act 1962;  they will include, for instance, a number of important commuter andcross-country services whose closure the Board has refrained from proposing because of their social and economic importance.   There may also be other elements of the Board&apos;expenditure which can be properly attributed to socialrequirements and which ought to be handled exceptionally.16.   A permanent revision of the financial framework within which the Railways Board operates will require legislation and this will be introduced later.   In themeantime it is important that the Board, the railwaymen and the public should know as soon as possible how much ofthe present deficit can be fairly regarded as attributable to the maintenance of unremunerative services which thecommunity requires.   Arrangements are, therefore, beingworked out with the Board to identify these costs so thatthey can be published in the Board&apos;s Annual Report   and accounts.    This will be one of the first tasks in the review described below.17.   As part of the long-term arrangements- the Governmentis considering the possibility that local communitiesmight assume some, at any rate, of the financial responsibility for passenger services whose retention isrequired for local reasons, if they should decide that theline ought to be preserved as part of the local transport system.    This responsibility would devolve on any new transport authorities that might in future bo established for the areas concerned. /l8.- 11 -
18.    These changes will enable a real drive to be madeto eliminate the deficit over the rest of the system apartfrom these &quot;social&quot; services.     The Government intends thatthe Board&apos;s operations as a whole (including the running ofthe &quot;social&quot; services) should be carried out with efficiency and enterprise.      It proposes periodically to determine and make public realistic objectives for the Board by which its progress towards a fully economic basis of operation can be measured.      These objectives will, of course, be set within.the context of the new financial framework.     The Board&apos;sessential task will be to operate economically and effectively on the new basis, and to move as soon as possibleto a position of financial equilibrium.     In this it should ,be greatly helped by the removal of the depressing effect ofan apparently perpetual deficit, attributable at least in part to factors outside its control.Joint studies19.    The establishment of the new financial framework willrequire the identification and costing of those servicesand facilities whose cost should property be borne or aided by the community.     This&quot;will be a complex and difficultjob.      The Government and the Railways Board have accordingly decided to set up joint machinery for the study of these and certain related questions. These studies will be controlled by a Steering Group under the chairmanship of theJoint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport;the other members will be drawn from the Railways Board and government Departments, together with two distinguishedindustrialists and a working railwayman./20.-12:-CONF1DENTBAL
20.   The main study will be carried out by a teamincluding experts from the Ministry and the Board,together with independent consultants, into certain aspectsof the Board&apos;s finances with a view to working out a new and acceptable basis for meeting the costs of the &quot;sociallynecessary&quot; services.   The team will consider the suitability of the Board&apos;s management structure and procedures in thelight of changes which may stem from other proposals in theWhite Paper, in particular from the proposal to set upa national freight organisation.   The detailed terms ofreference of the review are set out in the Annex.21.   These studies will be of a different kind from theseveral studies into the railways of this country whichhave hitherto been undertaken.    In the first place,they will be jointly controlled and undertaken, so thatthe experience and detailed knowledge which can come fromthe Board will be applied within the broad framework of theGovernments policy, and can in turn affect that policyand the proposed legislation at the formative stage.Then their scope will be sufficiently wide to ensure thatthe railways are considered v/ithin the context of thetransport system as a whole.     The studies willalso, where necessary, be carried out in depth,for instance in the identification and costing ofunresjunerative passenger services.   Finally the teamundertaking the enquiries will not bo limited. Experthelp will be brought in from outside wherever thisproves desirable.i i/22.
22.    The Government is confident that these measures will provide the conditions for the progressive development of the railway services to meet the needsof present and future users and for a correspondingimprovement in the Board&apos;s financial position.    Inthis new venture it looks for the full co-operationof both management and men, relieved of the uncertaintiesof the past and encouraged to set their sights on a successful future.- Ik -
Ills     ROADS AMD ROAD SAFETY *1.     The Road ProgrammeWhatever is done over the next two decades to improve our railways, roads will have the dominant role in themovement of passengers and goods.    They carry almost 90$of the passenger traffic and almost 60$ of the goods traffic.Good roads are vital to the efficient working of industry,the movement of exports and the quality of life in our towns.The importance which the Government attaches to the roads programme is shown by the resources it is devoting to it.Current Exchequer expenditure on new roads and major improvements in Great Britain has risen to about  180 million a year.    Provision has been made in the National Plan forthis to be increased to  280 million (at constant prices)hy 1970.    These figures include Scotland and Wales and in what follows in this chapter references to the Ministerinclude references to their Secretaries of State.2,     This   rapidly rising programme is tackling two maintasks.   The first is to provide an effective inter-urbannetwork of major routes.   By 1970 more than 700 miles ofmotorway will have been completed out of the planned1,000 miles and 350 miles of trunk roads will have been built or reconstructed.    Thus, by 1970, the trafficsituation will have been greatly improved on certain of themost important routes, with faster journey times, greatersafety and more satisfactory travelling conditions^   Thesecond task ds   to step up   the rate  of   classifiedroad building in towns, a problem of growing urgency whichis dealt with in Chapter IV.   Unless we can &apos;give thisgreater importance, conditions in our towns will becomeintolerable.3.     Despite increasing expenditure on the roads programme,the backlog of years of neglect and the rise in trafficmean that our roads will be still more congested in the/1970s
CONFIDENTIAL $28197^s than they are now.- the Road Research Laboratoryforecasts   that both vehicle ownership and vehicle milestravelled will double between now and 1980.    The crucialquestions therefore are how much of our national resourcescan be devoted to roads in the 1970s, having regard to allthe other demands on public investment, and how to get full value for the money spent.4.     Plans for the improvement of inter-urban roads in the1970s are now being drawn up.   They are being based first ona complete assessment of the capacity of the present system to cope with future levels of traffic, and second on an appraisal of the economic returns which investment in roadimprovements is likely to produce.   The Ministry&apos;s existingtechniques for road investment appraisal are beingprogressively developed.   They will enable the Ministry to identify the type, place and timing of the schemes whichoffer the highest returns - and thus the highest benefits to the community.    Special techniques are needed becausebenefits from road improvements cannot be measured by simpleprofitability.    They are principally measured in terms ofthe savings in travelling time and vehicle operating costs and savings in cost of accidents which road improvementsachieve.    Further research into the calculation andprojection of these benefits and assembling and analysingthe basic data, is in hand.5.     Since roads are an essential part of physical andeconomic planning, the Ministry&apos;s plans have been drawn up after consultation with Regional Economic Planning Councils,other Government Departments, the National Ports Counciland the British Railways Board.   The plans will fit in withthe broad pattern of population growth in the 1970s and withthe Government&apos;s proposals for regional development.    Butchanges may he needed in&apos; the conception and timing of .particular-futures,.   The plans will, therefore, he kept under continuous review so that new needs can he met as they arise. ^ /6.CONFIDENTIAL
6.     The rate at which it will he possible to implement the plans will depend on the level of national resources whichit ?;ill be possible to devote to roads in the 1970s.    later this year the Government will announce the new road programme for 1970/71 and provisional figures for a planning periodcovering a further period of years.    This will allow workto start on the detailed planning and preparation of asubstantial number of road schemes.    This block of schemes will then be translated year by year into a firm programme,in full consultation with the other Departments concernedwith planning and with the Regional Planning Councils.Productivity7*    It is not enough simply to increase the resourcesallocated for roads.    We must also see to it that we getgreater value and greater output.    Action has already started.In 1965 the Government set up the E.D.C. for the civil engineering Industry under Lord Campbell of Eskan.    The E.L.C.in turn set up a Working Party to examine costs and productivity in the road construction sector of the industry,whose first report has just been published.The Government welcomes the report and is acting on it.In particular the Ministry is:(i)    developing its contract procedures so as to givecontractors better opportunities to workcontinuously on road construction, to employ their plantmore productively and to specialise more ;    this will mean a smaller number of firms being morecommitted to road construction, still, however,in effective competition with one another;(ii)    helping contractors and material suppliers withtheir forward planning by publishing everyquarter forecasts of every major scheme due to start within two years;
CONFIDENTIAL . . ni       a o n4 o U(iii)   making the most of contractors&apos; know-how bycollecting their experience on major contracts and taking fuller advantage of their suggestions for cost-saving modifications in design, giving them as well more time to study jobs and possible economies in them before tendering;(iv)   promoting the development of better road constructionplant and more investment in it;(v)   with the co-operation of the industry, gettingbetter data about the costs of design changes;significant savings are already on the way through changes in the Ministry&apos;s specificationsand there will be even more standardisation,especially in bridge design;(vi)   commissioning studies into the economics of construction, e.g. shift working, continuity of operation and the possibilities of serialcontracting;(vii)   reviewing the working of the statutory andadministrative procedures before a road is builtor improved.Further and more detailed studies of productivity inroad construction will be carried out which may well revealscope for further advances.8.     Although the trunk road and motorway programme is wholly financed by the Ministry, much of the design and engineering supervision of the construction of these roadsis at present undertaken by the county councils actingseparately as its agents.    This diffusion of effort doesnot make the best use of scarce engineering resources.Uniformity of standards and practices are difficult to achieve and continuity of work for experienced design and construction teams cannot be ensured./9-    j
CONFIDENTIAL A ^ .s*      4 oi9.     In order to remedy these defects the creation of a RoadsBoard, independent of the Ministry, has been advocated in some quarters to be responsible for the unified planning and construction of all highways.   But this is no real answer.The Government must retain control over the extent of nationalinvestment in the roads programme, its place in national and regional planning, and the determination of priorities.    Theexecution of the programme - design,  construction, contracts,development planning, rehousing, land acquisition and the like - involves so closely both central and local governmentthat the solution must lie in some new form of partnership between them.    The Government therefore proposes to establish a small number of larger-scale Road Construction Units,  eachcovering a number of counties, in which Ministry and countyengineers will work together on all aspects of design and construction work for the major motorway and trunk road schemes.    The Units will be able to make fuller use of specialist teams, economise on engineering resources, ensuregreater continuity of work and arrange an interchange ofstaff between the county councils and the Ministry.    Thestandard of technical and financial control will be improvedwhile much of the present duplication will be eliminated.The county councils have agreed to examine the details ofthe scheme urgently with the Ministry.    The Secretaries ofState for Scotland and Wales are considering how farsimilar arrangements would be useful in the conditionsobtaining in their countries.   ,Road Safety10.    No transport policy for the motor age will be completeunless it incorporates a new attitude to road safety.      Inthe last 10 years 3i million people have been injured on ourroads, 800,000 of them seriously, and&apos;67,000 have been killed.The toll of death and injury is steadily increasing andthe risk which every individual faces is a growing one.The chance of being injured in a road accident in 1934 wasone in 190;    by 196k it had become one in 156./If
CONFIDENTIAL MIf accidents continue to increase at the present rate, roadcasualities in the 1980s will he nearer a million a year thanthe present 400,000.    Even as things are, accidents are estimated by the Road Research Laboratory to be costingsome  220m. a year in damage to vehicles and property,medical treatment, police effort and in the cutting shortor interruption of life.    This figure excludes any allowance for the premature deaths of those whose contributions to thenation&apos;s well being is not generally measured in financial terms - such as housewives and the elderly.    Nor has anyattempt been made to assess in economic terms the pain andbereavement caused to millions.11.    Immense gains - both social and economic - can be wonfrom a reduction in road accidents.    In the past this problem has been tackled by applying remedies where the damage hasibecome obvious - as well as new roads, which substantiallyreduce accidents, highway programmes have included measures,such as the elimination of accident black spots, speciallyfor reasons of safety;    defects in vehicles have beentackled by a succession of regulations and arrangements for inspection;    human failure at the wheel or on foot hasprompted measures to reduce reckless or careless driving,accidents caused through drink, and the conflict betweenpedestrians and vehicles.    But useful though these measures have been,  they have not been able to prevent the risk of injury from rising.12.    To secure a real and lasting.improvement a more positiveand ambitious approach is needed.    As traffic increases, sodo the risks of death or injury and so, therefore, shouldthe resources and research we devote to reducing these risk.   But action needs to be better co-ordinated, plannedahead as the roads programme is planned, and concentrated on thasse measures which   are likely to produce the greatestsavings in life and limb.    Without such a lead from theGovernment, local authorities, vehicle manufacturers and/road
CONFIDENTIAL &quot;        433road users cannot &quot;be expected to make the further contribution which is needed from them all if we are to achieve greater road safety.13.    The Ministry is now drawing up its forward programme for attacking the problem on three fronts - safer roads,safer drivers,  safer cars.    To make the best use of our resources existing methods of economic assessment are being developed by the ministry&apos;s economists in conjunction withthe Road Research Laboratory.    And the Laboratory in itsnew relationship with the Ministry of Transport isintensifying its research into road safety and in particularinto those aspects of it such as human behaviour, which isat the root of the road safety problem.     The outcome ofthese studies will form the basis of the long-term programme which will be published later.

URBAN TRANSPORTTjigElements of the, IPrjjbl^em1,     About Q0% of our population live in urban areas, half ofthem in the larger towns and cities, and the proportion of town-dwellers is growing-    Many more people live near towns andtravel in for work, shopping or entertainment.    Providing theright transport services for this very large majority.of thepopulation is perhaps the most difficult and importanttransport problem we have to solve.    The challenge of the motor age is, therefore, at its most acute form in urban areastOur cities and towns developed on the pattern set by radialpublic transport systems - buses, trams, surface and undergroundrailways.   The growing use of private transport, brought about by rising prosperity, has now fundamentally altered thesituation,,    The motor car, allowing much more diverse patterns of movement, gives people greater freedom of choice in boththeir living and their working places.    Goods vehicles,catering for the growing needs of urban living, help to fill  &apos;the streets.2.      Unchecked,  these developments could distort our wholepattern of living, as they have done in some places in theUnited States.    Since the trend has not gone so far here,however, we still have the opportunity to shape our cities moreconsciously.,    But the objectives are complex,.    An efficient and convenient transport system is a necessary basis forliving in towns and yet it must be provided in a way that does not destroy other important elements of urban life.There is no single, easy or quick solution to this dilemma,but it is vital that v*ie should succeed in both theseobj ectives.A Comprehensive Approach3.     One thing is now clear.   The urban traffic and transportproblem can be successfully tackled only by a combination of
policieso   It is not enough simply to concentrate on moreroads or tough traffic management or improvements in thepublic transport services.   All these are needed as part ofintegrated policies worked out for each town and region..    Noris it   possible to solve transport problems in isolation.Town planning and transport planning must go hand in hand asthe proposals put forward by the Planning Advisory Group* stress the land use/transportation studies and traffic surveys nowbeing carried out in the conurbations and in larger townsprovide the basis of this planning, but the Government must provide the proper framework within which local authoritiescan act.Urban Road Planning: and Constructioniu     It is clear that to meet modern traffic needs, to protect the environment and to relieve congestion, our large cities and towns will need over the next generation a modern network of high capacity traffic routes.    These networks will call formassive investment in road construction.   We now have an expanded urban road programme, growing and gathering momentum.Even so, its present scale cannot be regarded as more than a beginning of the inevitably long and expensive job ofproviding enough road space in our towns.    A bigger programme will be needed in the 1970s,,  its extent and timing properlyrelated to the resources available for the road programme asa whole.   The Governments aim is to see that the new primarynetworks essential for the main traffic flows and theestablishment of environmental areas as visualised byProfessor Buchanan will be built as soon as the economic resources available for our transport needs allow.    before that is possible, however, the situation will be critical.,*The Future of Development.Plans I-LE,. S..0* 1965,- 23 -
CONFIDENTIALTraffic5,     Traffic policy, therefore, will continue to be an essential part of urban transport pi arming o   Traffic management andparking policies are primarily the responsibility of individuallocal authorities and the main role of the Ministry ofTransport has been to draw the attention of local authoritiesto the advantages to be had from adopting effective trafficpolicies - one-way streets, parking restrictions, waitingrestrictions and so on - and to making available to localauthorities advice on the latest techniques of traffic management..   The Ministry takes part in joint studies with local authorities and carries out joint experiments.   an example is the experiment in centralised computer control ofabout 70 signal intersections and 30&apos; pedestrian crossings inan area of 6-g square miles in West London, with the object of reducing journey times by more efficient linking of signals.A complementary experiment is being undertaken in CentralGlasgowo    The financing of traffic management schemes will be helped by the new Exchequer grant system, which will enableCounty Boroughs to get highway grants for them.60     An effective traffic policy, however should not only makeit possible for traffic to move more freely but also ensurethat the volume of traffic attempting to enter congestedcentral areas is sensibly related to the capacity of the road system.    This will require deliberate measures of trafficrestraint and the Minister will shortly publish a report onthe various methods of controlling the use of urban roads.    Atpresent, a thorough-going parking policy is the best method for achieving this, but in the longer term this may not be enough in the larger towns.    Other possible methods of restraint are,therefore, being investigated, including in particular methodsof road pricing.- 2h -
7.     In. congested conditions,  the individual road user paysconsiderably less for using a road than the cost be imposes onthe rest of the communityo   This leads to economic waste -chiefly in the form of delays to traffic   Road pricing - ametering system to charge directly for the use of congestedroads - is, from the economic point of view, the most obvioussolution to this problem,,    It is not yet established, however,that a reliable, workable and enforceable system can be devisedon the scale that would be needed.   Detailed research to testthe technical and operational feasibility of road pricing is nowin train and a special team has been set up in the road research Laboratory.8,     But whatever individual techniques of traffic managementmay prove worth while, it is already clear that traffic policyis going to be an increasingly important component in the wholetransport policy of big urban areas.   Two changes will be needed.   The powers of local authorities, in relation to traffic matters, must be improved, to make them as flexible and effective as possible and the Ministry of Transport must play a more positive role.   To this end powers under the road traffic Acts are being reviewed.Public Transport9T&quot;--initrll^iEu^Trsport has a key part to play in dealing withthe urban transport problems, both for the mass carriage of passengers at peak hours and for the transport needs of people without cars.    Yet public transport is in decline.Rising costs, the effects of congestion and the loss of passengers to private cars have all contributed to this situation.    Traffic management, by relieving congestion, can help public transport to operate more efficiently but more fundamental changes will be necessary.    1110.   The Government propose to deal with this in three ways:(i)   Re-organisationPublic transport in the conurbations must be reorganised.    The basic defects of the present       2
organisation are that the main elements in the transport system - public transport, road building and maintenance,and traffic control - are spearately planned and financed;that transport as a whole is not being integrated intothe general planning of conurbations; and that eachcontinuous urban area v/hich is a unit from the point ofview of its transport requirements is carved up between anumber of separate authorities.    In many of these areasbus operation is inefficient because of the small size ofthe undertakings.    Municipal and private bus servicesoften overlap and complex working agreements are necessary.Suburban rail services, particularly important forcommuter traffic, are under separate control.11 .   This fragmentation and lack of central, control militatesagainst any rational co-ordination of transport policies.    Thus,those responsible for traffic management and parking are not directly affected by the consequences of their policies for theoperation of public transport undertakings.   Public transportoperators, for their part, must try to pay their way without having any control over several of the factors which affecttheir power to do so.   Again, because local authorities havea financial responsibility for their own bus undertakings butnot for local railway services, their attitude tp...fare levels in either case is naturally quite different.12.    The lack of a carefully weighed local transport plan towhich all this must give rise is often exacerbated by thefact that highway development is grant-aided while rail or busdevelopment is not.   Local authorities therefore have littleincentive to explore the development of rail or other rapidtransit     systems which might better serve local needs.13. . In the long term the right solution will probably be theestablishment of single authorities in these areas with land use, highways, traffic and public transport responsibilities.
Clearly, however, a fundamental change of this kind must await the considerations and findings of the Royal Commission on localgovernmentoii4.0   Nevertheless, action is urgently necessary over the next two or three years if there is to be a proper development ofpublic transport over the next decade.    The Government,therefore, will promote the establishment in these areas of interim machinery that can put right at least some of the defects in the present system.   Already in some of the conurbations,  such as Merseyside, the local authorities andpublic transport operators concerned are working together onthe problems of integration and the Regional Councils are examining what steps might be taken in other areas.   TheGovernment welcomes and supports these initiatives.   They 1believe that as a first step conurbation transport authoritiesshould be created under broad local authority control, withthe duty of securing an efficient? convenient and integratedsystem of public transport for the urban region-    TheMinister of Transport proposes to take powers to create suchauthorities.15o    The Government believe that these arrangements can bemade without prejudice to the work of the Royal Commission andthat it should be possible to build into these imterimtransport organisations enough flexibility to allow theirabsorption in the long-term pattern of local government,whatever this might bec(ii) Finance16.   Public transport will not be able to play an effectivepart without financial help.   Where financial assistance provesnecessary, those who benefit directly or indirectly from theexistence of the service should contribute to its costs;    andit should be possible to use the revenue from any transport
- 28service (including parking) for wider transport purposes.    Itis also reasonable that the first source of &quot;outside&quot; supportshould be revenues from the local community.    Where outsideassistance is given, it will be important not to remove frommanagement the spur of clear financial objectives0/17. The
CONFIDE NT. AL44117.    The Government already contributes heavily to the cost ofbuilding and improving main roads in towns.    It now proposesan extension of this.   It intends to take powers to providefinancial help for the construction or majorimprovement of public transport structures that form part oflocal transport plans - railways, new forms of reserved tracktransport which may be developed, and terminal and interchangefacilities on public transport systems.(iii) Technical improvgment18.    Technical improvements are constantly being made invehicles and in methods of public transport operation.    Butpublic transport is still a labour-intensive industry, and itspatterns of operation have not changed enough in response tothe conditions in which it now operates.    More research is needed into new operating methods and the development of newlabour-saving equipment.    Steps are already being taken inthis field.   The Ministry has set up a group to examinethe technical and operational problems of one-man bus operation.Joint investigations are in hand in Leeds between theMinistry and the local authority over the whole transport and planning field.   A joint study has begun with manchester corporation into the comparative costs of various rapid transitsystems.    But more is needed.   The Government proposes to mounta large and centrally co-ordinated programme of research anddevelopment with the aim of securing a much needed improvement-in services and productivity.London19.   London1s transport problems are unique in their size and complexity.   And the ways in which they are being tackledrepresent the new approach which will be needed in otherconurbations.    The London Transportation Study, under the jointsponsorship of the Ministry of Transport and the greater london Council, is collecting the basic data on transport/movement\    - - - 29 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL ,        4^movement in London, projecting future demand for transport and developing new methods of evaluating the benefits of alternative forms of transport in the light of various possible land-use plans for the London area.    The work of the study is closely linked with that of the new TransportCo-ordinating Council for London, which brings together forthe first time, under the Chairmanship of the Minister of-Transport,  the major authorities responsible for highways,traffic management and the provision of transport facilities in London.    The Study and the Co-ordinating Council togetherwill provide valuable experience of the problems ofco-ordinating decisions and of determining which of manypossible strategies of urban development are the most desirable.20.    The Co-ordinating Council provides the framework withinwhich the planning of roads,  traffic management and public transport can be integrated.    Five working groups have been set up to deal with the co-ordination of public transport facilities;    the provision of interchange facilities, such ascar parks at stations;    investment in public transport;highways planning and the problems of freight transport.The aim is to achieve, by concerted action, immediateimprovements in travelling conditions and to define    what changes in the law may be necessary.21.    Public passenger transport in London is provided by twonationalised transport undertakings.   The Railways Board&apos;sproblems are discussed in Chapter II.   The London transport board, too, suffers from the defects of the 1962 transport act.    It has not only a statutory duty to pay its way, butalso a duty &quot;to provide or secure the provision of anadequate and properly co-ordinated system of passenger transport&quot;.    In practice, these duties have proved irreconcilable--cilable.   Difficult road operating conditions and shortage ofstaff have made it impossible for the Board to offer an/ adequatei    \ - 30 -
CONFIDENTIAL ,        ^adequate bus service.   Between 1955 and 1965 the numberof vehicles entering the Central Area during the morning-peak rose by 30%, hut carried 17% fewer passengers.    Duringthis period London Transport lost a third of its bus traffic;29,000 cars, carrying 39*000 people, took over from 1,900buses and occupied five times more road space.   For theBoard to pay its way is equally impossible in present con-ditions.   The difficulties have resulted in an overalldeficit of  1 million in 1965;    this will probably rise toabout  5^ million in 1966.22..    The first answer lies in comprehensive trafficpolicies including some deliberate measures of restraint,The Coordinating Council and its working groups are follow-ing up two major studies carried out earlier by the GreatertLondon Council at the Governments suggestion.   The first was an Investigation, jointly with London Transport and thePolice, into traffic management measures which might helpbus operations.    The second was a major programme for extending parking control over forty square miles of central London (with the object, among other things, ofmaking commuting by car less attractive).    Work is inhand in conjunction with the London Boroughs and others concerned to implement these two reports.23.   Action has also been taken by the Government to dealwith the immediate financial problems of London Transport.In the Transport Finances Act   1966 powers have been taken asan interim measure to provide deficit grants up to  16million to support the finances of the Board over the next three years.    But more radical solutions will be needed inthe long-term.   A joint review is therefore being under-taken by the Government and the Board will expert outsidehelp, of the Board&apos;s financial needs and commercial policies,and the main operating and management problems arising from them./ 2k.
CONFIDENTIAL a    a4442k.    Meanwhile, the practical job of planning major newfacilities for London is going ahead.    The road programme for the 1970s is being worked out by the Ministry and theGreater London Council together, with particular emphasisbeing placed on the right choice of major ring roads.Extensions of the Underground, further surface railwayelectrification, links to the airports and possible inter-change facilities are being examined within the Co-ordinatingCouncil machinery.   Any projects which can be justified ontheir individual merits will be approved inadvance of the comprehensive transportation plan to beproduced on the basis of the London Transportation Study.25.    These measures are a start towards the achievement ofa properly co-ordinated transport system for London;    asthe longer term studies are developed, wider measurea,involving legislation will be needed.- 32 -
1.     The main transport system - the railways, the inter-urban road network, the ports and airports - must he plannedcentrally and investment must he co-ordinated.    The centralGovernment must therefore draw up the broad framework for thedevelopment of the system, in the light of the total needsof the economy, and determine tko. main priorities within it.It is equally important however that the overall transportplan should reflect the needs of the individual regions.Decisions about road, rail and airport investment need to betaken in the light of comprehensive studies of the transportneeds of each region.    These in turn are dependent on, andmust be related to, the overall planning objectives for the region, and must take into account not only the   existingtransport requirements, hut also future population growth,changes in the structure of industry and employment, and theimportance of safeguarding and improving environmentalstandards.2.      The Regional Economic Planning Councils have an important part to play in the planning of transport.   As mentioned in chapter II, they are being consulted about the future size andshape    of the railway system and they have already given theGovernment their views about the inter-urban road plans forthe 1970s, the Interim Ports Plan and the future of the inland waterways.    Their advice will also he sought on theextent to which domestic air services need to be integrated with other forms of public passenger transport \as part of thedevelopment of national and regional transport plans.3.     Within the regions themselves there is a need for there-organisation and integration of public passenger transport services to enable them to meet more effectively the changingdemand brought about by the growing use of the private car.Over the five years up to 1965 the .proportion of all passenger/movement
movement accounted for by private transport has risen from56fo to 69c/o and this trend is likely to continue.    Yet formany people and many purposes public transport is stillessential.4.      The needs of public passenger transport vary with thecharacter of each locality,    The forms of integration,therefore, must be adapted to local needs.    Already, thelocal authorities in some of the conurbations are, with the government&apos;s encouragement, considering the possibility of setting up conurbation transport authorities to integrate all their passenger transport services.    But the need forrationalisation goes wider than the conurbations.    Thepresent structure and operations of public passenger transport, whether nationally owned, municipal or independent,have been determined largely by historical and geographicalgrowth.    They follow no rational pattern.    Despite thearrangements developed by operators to co-ordinate their services and facilities, considerable scope still exists for better connections and inter-change facilities,shared timetables and joint information services.Nor are the deficiencies likely to be overcome until thereis a basis on which the services can be planned as a whole.5.      The Minister of Transport has enlisted the help of the regional Economic Planning Councils in determining what isthe best means of achieving co-ordination, and ultimatelyintegration, of passenger transport.    At her request they arealready undertaking a number of pilot studies into thetransport problems of their regions, some of which cover the integration of passenger transport services in their areas,both in the large cities and elsewhere.6.      The Councils agree on the need for more effective co-ordination of passenger services.      Many of them think,however, that what is needed is the full integration of/those
these services and that the right answer, in the long term,may prove to he the setting up of regional, or sub-regional,transport authorities, responsible for all public passenger transport services in the area.    But they accept that, forthe short term, some voluntary machinery for co-ordinationwould help.    At the Minister&apos;s request, the Councils have considered what would be the most appropriate machinery foreach, of their regions and they are all now agreed thattransport Co-ordinating committees, or bodies with very similar functions, closely linked with the Councils, shouldbe set up in each region.7.      The Minister of Transport has accepted the Councils&apos;advice and steps are now being taken to set up these committees.    They will co-operate with co-ordinating committees or transportation survey steering committees already established within the conurbations.    Their membership will include representatives of the Regional Councils, localauthorities, local transport operators, users and tradeunions and the Chairmen of the Traffic Commissioners willbe associated with the Committees&apos; work.    They will probablyfind it convenient to work through small expert groupsdealing with particular subjects or areas.    Their main taskwill be to study the local transport arrangements and advise on the steps necessary to get a more effective andco-ordinated service by public transport.    They will alsoadvise on such related matters as traffic managementmeasures to assist public transport, on the siting of carparks in relation to public transport facilities and on arrangements for inter-change between train and bus or between different bus services.Rural transport.3.     In recent years bus operators have been exposed to thetwin forces of sharply declining demand and, steeply rising costs.    The former pressure has largely derived from the- 35 - /substitutionCONFIDENTIAL
substitution of private transport.    The latter has risenmainly because wages are 70$ of bus operating costs.9.     Whilst there is no evidence of any large withdrawal of bus services these adverse pressures cannot be allowed tocontinue without check.    For the people who would suffer from any decline in bus services would include adisproportionately high percentage of the economically weak -in particular the old, the young, the poor and the infirm.10.    In the Governmnet&apos;s view, if help from public funds isto be made available to secure that rural services are providedor continued, the local community should, take its part in determining what services are to be considered as essential and should contribute to the cost.    The Government proposes,therefore, that local authorities shall he empowered to give,at their discretion, financial assistance for providing orimproving road passenger transport for the benefit of rural areas and the people living in them.    The Minister ofTransport will be empowered to contribute towards the costs incurred by local authorities in giving such financialassistance.    General criteria for assessing assistance willhe worked out in consultation with the local authorities.Legislation will provide that assistance can be given inrespect either of the ordinary bus services where this isrequired, or of services of a less conventional nature(for example, run.   by smaller vehicles) where these would meet the public need,   and would relieve the regularoperator of a heavier responsibility.- 36 -
VT J    A NATIONAL FREIGHT plan the Distribution of Freight traffic at a time when many trunk roads carrying large numbersof goods vehicles are heavily overloaded, main railway line shave spare capacity.    This situation is so clearly in conflict with the best use of national resources that theGovernment has put.in hand a comprehensive review ofthe policy for freight transports2.     In 1965 the distribution of freight between the maincarriers was as follows -Tons Ton Miles. ^Share     Average(Millions) (Millions) (Ton-Miles)   Haul(Miles)Road                            1,430 hi,000 60            30Rail                                229 15,400* 23            70Coastal Shipping            33 11;,000 16          210Inland Waterways             8                   132 - 1.5Pipelines                         2Z                   800 1 40   ,^Excluding carriage of railways own materials (which amountedto 1,000 million ton-miles in 1962),A small tonnage of inland freight is also carried by air03.     The staple components of the coastwise traffic aroundBritain are coal and oil.    For these steady flows of bulkcommodities between coastal sites, shipping is a cheap and efficient form of transports    Coal carryings are expected to decline but an increase in oil traffic will offset this loss and is likely to maintain the overall tonnage conveyed byship.    Improvements in terminal handling facilities at the ports will increase the efficiency of sea transport forthese bulk traffics.   The Government sees no reason atpresent for suggesting any change in the arrangements underwhich coastal shipping cperates.4.     The domestic airlines are rapidly increasing the quantityof freight they carry, but this is likely, in the foreseeable future, to remain a very small fraction of the total amountof freight moved.   Air transport carries a limited range&apos;ofcompact and generally high value goods.    These are specialised,traffics, and so there is no reed to bring air transportwithin the compass of the Governments new plan for freight,
5.     The inland waterways have a minor part in the overall &apos;freight picture.    As Chapter VIII explains, they are important only in a few limited areas and principally fortraffics such as solid fuel, &quot;bulk liquids and some generalmerchandise.    The economic use of the waterways must be fully developed, but it can never be significant on anational scale, and the Government does not consider itnecessary to make specific provision for this traffic in itsnew proposals for freight transport.6.,     Apart from water and gas distributed by the public utilities, the main materials moved by pipeline are crude oil and petroleum products.   By 1970 probably about 50 percent more than the present quantities will be conveyed,.Local industrial distribution systems are expected to be developed on a wide scales   but trunk lines have a more restricted role in the overall transport picture, becausethey are justified only by large, regular flows of a very limited range of products.    The development of trunklines is already controlled by the Government, and as faras the future of pipelines can be foreseen at present there is no reason to alter this control.7.     The greatest scope for rationalisation lies in road and rail transport.    The large number of companies making up the road transport industry between them provide facilities for the carriage of general merchandise toall parts of the country.Particularly for traffic which arises in lorry-load quantities, or can be aggregated, the serviceprovided is convenient, profitable and competitive./Road3c?CONFIDENTIAL
Road transport does not usually have the same advantage in the carriage of traffic which arises in, or canbe aggregated into, bulk.    The railways, by contrast,have at present two distinct roles in the field ofgeneral merchandise.     On the one hand, they competedirectly with road haulage for consignments whichare of wagon-load size or smaller.     This is uneconomicalbecause it involves the time-wasting, expensive andrepetitive process of handling wagons one at a time,which is rapidly becoming obsolescent.     On the otherhand, the railways are able to move goods in largequantities very economically.     This is beingeffectively exploited for mineral traffic, other bulkcommodities and company trains, but remains largelyunexploited for general merchandise.   Yet there isa large amount of traffic which could be aggregatedfor through movement between terminals, equipped with modern road/rail transfer facilities, in the maincentres of industry and population.    There is thus a strong technological and economic ca,se for therailways progressively/ceasingi i3?
ceasing to deal with single wagons in isolation andconcentrating on the carriage of traffic which can he bulkedinto full train-loads or even part train-loads0   road transport can then complement this role by collecting andbulking general merchandise for trunk haul by rail andsubsequently sorting and delivering it by road0   By contrast,wagon load traffics which are not easily aggregated, do not come forward in regular flow/s, or involve circuitous routingwould in many cases be better transported by road than rail.8.     The railways and road transport v-ogether account for about80 per cent of inland transport.    The bulk flows of suchtraffics as coal, minerals and raw materials for the iron andsteel industry, for whicn the railways are generally the    jmost satisfactory means of transport, at present form about70 per cent of rail ton-mileage.   At the other end of thescale is the traffic for which there is no alternative to road transport, such as local distribution, medium distancework involving collection from and delivery to many differentpoints en route, and certain specialist loads.    It isestimated that this traffic comprises between 70 percent and 80 per cent of the ton-mileage carried byroad.    It is within the remaining traffics, amountingto some 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the total road and rail ton-mileage, that the real scope forrationalisation arises.    Of this, the two-thirds nowbeing carried by road includes some traffic - particularlylong-distance traffic - which is suitable for rail, andfor which there Is ample spare capacity on the railways;the third now moving by rail includes some short-distanceand other traffic which could better be carried by road./9,
9.     Over the past ten years rail freight traffic has declined by some 5?000 million ton-miles, while total goodstraffic has increased almost three times that amount.    Thishas been mainly brought about by, on the one hand, a heavydecline of coal traffic, offset to a limited extent &quot;by a modest rate of growth in the transport requirements of the steel industry, and, on the other hand, an upsurge in the outputof the industries that have hitherto provided the most important of the traffics carried &quot;by road - construction and building materials, food, drink and tobacco.   The decline in railton-mileage occured almost wholly between 1956 and 19620Between 1962 and 1965 rail ton-mileage (excluding therailways&apos; own materials) has been between 15?500 and16,000 million ton miles a year,10.    In the five years 1965 to 1970 the total demand for goods transport - amounting in 1965 to 68,000 millionton-miles - is expected to grow by about 20 per cent or bysome 1U,000 million ton-miles.    On present trends, thegreat hulk of this would he additional road traffic.    If therailways were just to maintain their 1965 share of traffic,industry by industry, they would gain only some 1 ,500million ton-miles or about one-tenth of the total newtraffic.A new plan for freightand rail has &quot;been the determination of successiveConservative Governments to destroy the machinery forintegrating road and rail transport.   A substantial part11.    One of the main causes of this imbalance between road/of
of the country&apos;s road/rail freight system (accounting for approximatly one half of the ton-mileage by public transport)is owned by the British Railways Board and the TransportHolding Company.   Under the Transport Act, 19-62, they operatenot only independently but in competition with each other.Each undertakes&apos;&quot; the handling of large or small consignments of general merchandise.   There is no   obligation on them toco-ordinate consignments by road and rail,   On the contrarythey duplicate each otherrs facilities and services.   Asa result the nation5s transport resources, particularly the\ railway network, have not been put to the best use and the ability of the public sector to offer an efficient door-to-doorroad and rail freight service   has not been fully exploited012.   The Government has, therefore, been considering the integration of the freight services of the two publicly-owned undertakings on a functional basis, concentrating ina single national freight organisation? operating on a commercial basis, responsibility for general merchandise and sundriestraffic.   The object would be for the organisation to offer the customer a comprehensive   efficient and cheaper door--to-door service, including collection, transport and distributionof his goods, by rail or road or both as appropriate for theparticular loado .....13.   Such a reorganisation would have the advantages, amongstothers, of -(i)    increased efficiency through(a) the integration and. rationalisation of suchfixed installations as depots, warehousesand maintenance and workshop bases inthe public sector,0(b) the integration of the Railways Board&apos;s andthe British Road services collection and delivery services;

Betterfreight handling would, benefit all through services,not only road and rail but also sea and air;(iii) the bringing together within a single management of marketing and development policies at presentapplied by two separate managements of publicly-owned undertakings within the same sectors of the freight market.1h-.    Details of the new national freight organisation arebeing worked out, in consultation with the Railways Board,the Holding Company, the transport unions and userorganisations.   Among the matters still under consideration  &apos;are the working relationship between the Railways Board andthe new body, the arrangements for co-ordinating their policies and operations, including their pricing policies,  and the division of staff and assets between them,\5o    It is, however,  clear that it is through the reorgariisa-tion and rationalisation of the non-bulk traffics that thegreatest immediate benefits can be obtained.   The key tosuccess in this task will lie in making the most efficient andeconomic use of both road and rail transport in the interestsof all concerned, with all suitable traffic being bulked forcarriage by rail in train-load quantities.   The ultimate solution in the long term may prove, in the light of further examination, to be that the new body should be the marketingorganisation for all freight traffic in the public sector;but for the present the Railways Board will continue to beresponsible for bulk traffics, other company trains and freight which moves, mainly in whole train-loads, whollywithin the railway system.16.   The provision of a comprehensive door-to-door service for small consignments and general merchandise traffic will
require the development of a network of modern road/railtransfer terminals.   The Railways Board are already planning a freight grid, which will lead to the concentration ofgeneral merchandise traffic, not destined for private sidings,ma j or at some fifty/terminals in the main centres of industry and population and conveniently located for the transfer of road traffic for trunking by rail.    Direct railway services, using the latest equipment, will operate between the terminals andcollection and delivery over wide areas will be undertaken by road vehicles.   A national freight organisation could develop this freight grid to secure a rational use of road and rail facilities, and at the transfer depots could providewarehousing and other facilities for the making and breakingof bulk as may be required.Interim Measures17*   Legislation is necessary to set up a new National Freightorganisation.   The Government does not intend to wait before taking steps to promote co-ordination between the freightoperations of the Railways Board and the Transport holding company.    It is discussing with them how best their services can now be organised to complement one another and so tofacilitate the setting up of the new organisation.    It is planned to make an early start on the  co-ordination, of theparcels service of British Road Services with the freightsundries service of the Railways Board.Review of Road Goods Transport Policy18.    One of the most serious weaknesses of past transportpolicies has been the failure to identify the relative costs,both economic and social, of carrying goods by road and railoThe value of the Beeching report&apos;s analysis into the role ofthe railways was to a large extent vitiated by the lack of asimilar analysis of the true costs of carrying goods by road.Nor was this failure remedied by the setting up in October 1963
CONFIDENTIAL ,        ^of the Geddes Committee on Carriers1 Licensing,    The termsof reference given to it by the Conservative government were so limited that it was unable to consider policy on roadgoods transport as part of a plan for the carriage of freightas a whole.   Although it received evidence from variousquarters both for and against the argument that road hauliersare not paying their true costs it decided that it was not necessary to its task to pronounce on this issue.19.   The first essential in any policy designed to secure theright balance between different forms of transport,particularly road and rail, must be to remedy this deficiency in our knowledge.    As a first step the Ministry ofTransport is developing a trunk route transport costs model,which will show the relative costs of carrying goods by road and rail on certain trunk routes and the effect on costs of altering the distribution of traffic between road and rail.It is also carrying out a survey of transport from industrial establishments to get more detailed information about the factors which influence the choice made by users between different forms of transport.20.    The transport costs model will help to answer thehitherto unresolved question of track costs, and theGovernment expects to have the necessary data towards theend of this year.   It will then be in a position to decide,on the basis of a proper economic assessment, what changes, &apos;in. the conditions under which road goods vehicles areoperated will, be required.    In the meantime it would not be right to take any decision about the detailed recommendationsof the Geddes Committee on the future of the road goodslicensing system.   The Government accepts the Committee^ viewthat the present carriers&apos;  licensing system is wasteful,ineffective and unduly complicated;    it agrees that it isill-designed to achieve the objectives for which it was setup, even where these objectives are still relevant.    But it
does not agree that the system should be scrapped.    On thecontrary, it believes that it will be necessary to devise licensing system which is an effective instrument of a modernnational freight policy.21 .    These studies need not delay steps to improve the safety and efficiency of road vehicles and to limit the socialnuisance-, particularly from noise and smoke, and theGovernment is taking urgent action in this field.    The safety regulations applied to road goods vehicles are being reviewed and improved.   Higher standards for braking are being introduced.    Schemes for &quot;plating&quot; goods vehicles with the weights they may safely carry, for testing them regularly andfor type-approving essential features of the construction ofnew goods vehicles at the manufacturing stage are being developed.    These were described in detail in the White Paper&quot;Road Safety Legislation 1965/6&quot; of December 1965   which alsoconfirmed the Governmenfs intention to re-introduce speciallicences and tests for the drivers of heavy goods vehicles.The necessary new powers will be sought in the Road Safety-Bill.   New controls over noise and smoke are being developed;,and the Ministry is studying ways of reducing the nuisanceto other road users from loads of exceptional size andweight.22.   Regulations to improve safety are effective only if theyare properly enforced.    The staffing, direction and priorities of the enforcement work now being carried out inthe Traffic Areas are, therefore, being reviewed in order tosecure the most efficient management end direction of this wo&quot;nd the best results in terms of road safety./ 23cCmnd.  2859
23.    The Government is also considering ways in which theefficiency and productivity of the road haulage industry mayhe effectively improved.    It wishes, too, to link the road haulage industry more effectively with national and regional economic and transport planning.    Representatives of theindustry are beginning to play their part in the developmentoi ideas and plans for transport in the regions, but theindustry should be brought in more effectively at national level.24. To achieve all this will require a fundamental and detailed re-shaping of policies, legislation, regulations and machinery now effecting road goods transport.    TheGovernment has set this in hand.    Representatives of bothmanagement and the Unions in road goods transport, and ofindustry, will be fully consulted in the course of this review.
VII:    PORTS RE-0RGAHI3.ATI0N AND MODERNISATION1.   &apos; For a country as d expend en t as Britain upon international trade, an efficient ports system is vital.   The inadequaciesof our ports for present and expected needs have become increasingly apparent.    In too many cases exporters andimporters are not getting services of the quality they require.In this respect they are at a serious disadvantage in comparisonwith their competitors in other major industrialised countrieswhich have modern and up-to-day port transport.    the seriousness of the situation is aggravated by the prospect that, as the economy expands, the volume of imports and exports passing through the ports will also grow rapidly.2.     Considerable improvements have been made at a number of ports in recent years, but a great deal more needs to be done.The Government has, therefore, prepared a programme of actionwhich includes the modernisation and development of port facilities, the introduction of investment grants, and theincoporation in port charges of incentives and deterrents.Even more important in the longer run are the governments proposals for radical changes in the administrative structure and ownership of the ports and in the conditions ofemployment of the dock workers.Capital Investment3.     First, the Government intends to press ahead with a programme of capital development.    It accepted in principle the National Ports council s Interim Plan for- port development which provided for the construction of  some 70 new berths andthe renovation of i+6 more, at a total cost of about :3150m..But the Plan is not a rigid one:  as the Council have pointedout, a high degree of flexibility is required in port planning.It will be necessary, for instance, to take account of the accelerated development of unit transport services, which will increase enormously the &quot;through-put&quot; of cargo at a moderndock berth but require many times the amount of land needed/for
confidential for a conventional berth.    The further ports plans will containforecasts of this country1s trade in the 1970s, by bothcommodity and world zones, and assessments of the adequacy of existing port capacity.    From this will be determined the capacity needed in the ports, in the light, in particular,of such technological developments as the rapidly increasinguse of containers and pallets and the packaging of cargoes,such as timber, previously handled as &quot;break bulk&quot; cargoes.Studies will also be required of the trends in ship size forthe main categories of freight and for the shipping routesserving this country.h.     All this will take time.    Meanwhile, the Government,with the help and advice cf   the National Ports Council, ispressing forward with the task of making the ports fit tosatisfy the demands imposed by modern methods and techniques.Over the next few years, investment on schemes in the InterimPlan and other necessary improvements will amount- to some 2OO-250m.    It is essential that this capital should bewisely spent.    The working of the investment control procedure under the Harbours Act, 1964, will secure that the projectsapproved, as well as being justifiable from the point of viewof the port authorities, also yield the highest possiblebenefits to the community as a whole, e.g. through saving oflabour, and are consistent with the Governments overallplanning.5.     It is essential, if the right investment decisions areto be taken, for the improvement in the costing andforecasting of port authorities to be carried still further.There has been much useful work in this field in recent years but there is still a good deal to be done.    In particular, theintroduction of management accounting throughout the industryand at all levels is of high importance./6V
6. -    The National Ports Council has also clone valuable workin improving the financial state of the ports and in securingimprovements in their budgeting and. accounting.    Many ports are still financially weak, but lack of funds should no longer be a constraint upon desirable investment.   The schemerecently announced by the Government will provide investment grants to port authorities and port operators of 20^ on approved expenditure on plant and equipment in harbours andon harbour works.    Government loans will continue to beavailable to port authorities.Bs tuarJL    JJniXlS^^^P-Q7.      Immediately, steps are being taken to  secure a greaterdegree of unification of control in all the major port areas.The Clyde Bstuarial Authority has been functioning since january 1st of this year; schemes for the Forth, the Humberand Southampton Water are in an advanced stage; a Private Billfor the unification of facilities on the Tees is beforeParliament.   These interim measures will provide for much needed concentration and closer supervision of development and operation than is possible with the present system offragmented management and ownership.   The Docks and HarboursBill now before Parliament contains a number of provisionsdesigned to increase port efficiency and to facilitate the carrying out of port reorganisation proposals; additional powers are proposed for the National ports Council to enable it to carry out its planning functions more effectively.Port Labour8.     The main purpose, however, of the Docks and Harbours Billis to provide a system for the licensing of employers of dockworkers.    The aim is  to bring about a large scale reduction inthe number of employers in the ports so as to eliminate thecasual employer and reduce the present excessive fragmentationof resxjonsibility.    These proposals constitute an important/step
step forward in the Government&apos;s policy of improving industrial relations and efficiency in the ports and will place greatercontrol and responsibility on the major port authorities.9-      Since the war efficiency has been greatly impaired bypoor labour relations and inadequate use of labour in anoutdated physical environment.    In November 196I4. the Ministerof Labour appointed a Committee under- Lord Devlin to inquire into the problem and its Report was published in August 1965*It recommended, as the Rochdale Report had done in 1962,  theabolition of the casual system of employment in the docks andthe introduction of permanent employment for all dock workers.Linked with this were detailed recommendations for- the licensing of port employers, amendment of the National Dock Labour Scheme,the improvement of amenities for dock workers, revision of thewages structure and the abolition of restrictive practices.10o    The National Joint Council for the Fort Transport Industryaccepted the principles of the Report and set up a NationalModernisation Committee under the Chairmanship of Lord Brownto work out the detailed changes.    Action to adapt the existingDock Labour Scheme to a system of permanent employment and negotiations on the terms and conditions to be introduced aspart of the new system is well advanced.    In addition tolegislating for the licensing of dock employers the Docks andHarhours Bill provides for the improvement of welfare amenitiesfor dock workers.    The Government believes that these radicalreforms in conditions of employment -will provide a basis for betterindustrial relations and greater efficiency in the docks in theimmediate future.11.    There is much else that can be done in the short term to improve efficiency.   There is great scope for the improvement of existingmethods and practices,  in particular the adoption of the most modernmethods of cargo handling.   There is room, too, for the developmentof more efficient methods of operation and management.    TheGovernment will take the steps necessary to secure this, and at thesame time will seek to encourage the rapid developments which are*Cmnd 2734 /being-n-CONFIDENTSAL
being made in the unitisation of cargo012.- Modernisation of the financial and charges structures ofthe ports is also essential, and the work at present being doneby the National Ports Council on these matters will be givenhigh priority.    The aim must be to ensure that port charges are basedon economic costs and cross-subsidisation of services is eliminated.The level of charges should be such as to encourage an efficient flow of goods, for example the delivery of export goods to the docks inan orderly sequence, planned to fit in with the loading of ships.Movement of Exports13.    If the export drive is to succeed, and the image of british exports is to be improved, exports must be moved quickly and efficiently to the overseas customer.    This is not simply a portsproblem:    improvements are needed all along the chain, includinghandling in the factory or depot, inland transport, ports,shipping and air freight.    The Government therefore set up, inthe summer of 1965, an Economic Development Committee for theMovement of Exports, under Lord Oaldecote,  &quot;to examine the presentmovement of goods for export and to make proposals to improveand speed.it&quot;.14.    The first need is to obtain comprehensive information, whichis not at present available, about export movement times, thepoints at which delays occur and the effect of delayed orunreliable delivery on the willingness of foreign customersto buy British goods.    This information is being obtained withthe help of consultants.15.   Meanwhile, the Committee is working hard to encourage more efficient export movement.    In particular,  it has -published its first report, which sets out comprehensive recommendations on theimportance of the through transport concept for exporting to europe, and the need to improve transport facilities (particularly the development of unit load systems and the establishment of inland clearance depots), to streamline customs procedures andto simplify export documentation./Reorganisation-51-.CONFIDENTIAL
Reorganisation16.   The policies set out in this Chapter are immediate and necessary steps towards the realisation of the Governmenfs longterm intention of reorganising the ports on the basis of public ownership.   This will require the creation of a strong national ports Authority and publicly-owned Regional Ports Authorities,and the details of the plan are now being worked out.   Centralto the conception is the establishment of a National Portsiluthority as the main planning and policy agency, and as suchresponsible for the control of the development wf a comprehensivenational plan for ports, the selection of particular ports andprojects for development, and the relationship of the ports plan and port investment to the National Plan.    It will also he responsible for such common services as research, statistics,and training, and the general lines of charges policy.17.    The Regional Port Authorities will have a wide measure of independence and will be encouraged to plan the developments called for by the needs of the regions within the guiding lines laid downby the National Ports Authority and in conformity with therequirements of the National Plan.
VIII:   INLAND WATERWAYS1.     Pew of the 2,000 miles of canals and river navigationscontrolled by the British Waterways Board now have any important transport roles to fill;    only a few hundred milesare commercially viable.     But most of the rest of theBoard&apos;s system, constructed in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, before the days of therailways, is ill-placed to compete for the carriage of freight.     It is idle to suppose that in this countryeconomic canal development could have any significant effecton the volume of road traffic.     Canals are now carryingless than one half per cent, of the total inland nationalfreight tonnage.2.     The Board is nevertheless still obliged by legislation,much of it as old as the waterways, to keep many hundreds ofmiles open to commercial navigation regardless of the extentof their use for carrying goods.     The expense is considerable and the losjes heavy.     The time has come for a hard look at the facts which are available for the first time in a comprehensive and realistic form in the Board&apos;s Report,&quot;The Pacts about the Waterways&quot;..     The first task is to match the waterways and the obligations imposed on theirowners to modern needs ;nd conditions.3.     Most of the assets created by the investment of pastgenerations in the waterways have - and can have - no furthercommercial value.     The Government does not propose to invest large resources in new transport waterways, but those few existing nationally owned waterways which caniiform an economic transport undertaking will, with theirallied transport facilities such as docks and warehouses,be operated on a commercial basis in a separate divisionof the Board&apos;s undertaking with a more realistic capital/structure- 54 -
structure. Ancillary sources of revenue, such as the saleof water, will continue to be exploited.k.     In their Report the Board referred to a special group of well-known waterways, the Crinan and Caledonian Canalsin Scotland and the Lower Grand Union Canal in the london area,which lose money heavily.     Their future will needconsideration in the light of the special needs ofScotland and London.5.     The standards to which the remaining waterways shouldbe maintained - or whether they should be eliminated aswaterways - must be decided in the light of theimportance of the other purposes they could fulfil and the costs involved.     The waterways form an integral and important part of drainage and agricultural and industrialwater supply systems and plans for their future must payparticular regard to these important functions.     but whatever is done a continuing charge on public funds ofat least  600,000 a year seems unavoidable.6.     As was made clear in the White Paper &quot;Leisure in the countryside&quot; K many waterways provide usefully forrecreational activities such as canoeing and fishing.     Thepreservation of existing facilities for these activitieswould as a rule give rise to little or no expenditure whichcould otherwise be avoided.     But the increasing use ofwaterways by powered pleasure boats creates a differentproblem.     If the non-commercial waterways at present used by these boats were to be closed to them the annual losscould be cut from about  9^0,000 a yea- to the inescapableminimum of about  600,000 a year at present costs.     Butonce they were taken out of use for pleasure cruising and standards of maintenance lowered it is unlikely that itwould ever be possible to restore them.     It would be/wrongx Cmnd. 2928- 55 -
wrong to allow this to happen to those waterways which seem likely to have a valuable part to play in meeting thecountry1 s leisure-time needs in years to come.7.     The Government will, therefore, discuss with the waterways Board and the appropriate bodies in the regionsconcerned, and with the representatives of users, the extentof the network it would he justifiable to maintain in theimmediate future for use by pow red pleasure boats.These discussions must be completed in time for legislation to he enacted to take the place of the present statutory provisions which expire at the end of 1968.     The networkwhich the Government decides should be maintained for use by powered pleasure boats following these discussions will again be reviewed after five years, and thereafter at regular intervals, in the light of the use made of it, ofthe success achieved in attracting more custom and inexploring the possibility of increasing charges and other sources of revenue, and of prospects for the future.     TheGovernment must, however, reserve the right during theperiod between these reviews, exceptionally, to close awaterway to use by powered pleasure boats by statutoryorder if the cost of keeping it open proves to be out of proportion to the benefit from it.8.     In the Government&apos;s view, both the commercial and theamenity waterways owned by the Waterways Board should remain under the single management of the Board.     The day-to-dayrunning of the waterways re uires specialised skills, tocover such services as water control, lock repairs and the safety of canals and river navigations, all needing to heco-ordinated over wide areas to ensure the efficiency ofthe system as a whole.     Moreover, because of the costthat must continue to fall on the exchequer uer for many years,the Government must maintain direct control of expenditurethrough the Board.- 56 -CONFIDENTIAL
- 57 -9.     At the s..me time there will be scope for voluntaryeffort.     There are many people who have given of thairtime and resources to working on can .1s to fit them forrecreational use and also to advocating their cause.This energy and enthusiasm should not be allowed to gofor nought.     The Government proposes, therefore, that the waterways Board should be empowered to enter into agreements for the rehabilitation of disused waterways forrecreational purposes by suitably organised bodies whichcan raise the necessary resources of finance and labour by voluntary effort, without any additional burden beingimposed on public funds.
IX:    ECONOMIC PLANNING AND RESEARCH:TECHNOIOGICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT5C gnomic JPlanning and .ResearcIi1.      The need ILx a planned and co-ordinated developmentof the country&apos;s transport system has been the dominanttheme of this &quot;white Paper.    But planning must be done inthe light of the facts, and up till now insufficient dataon transport has been available to permit this.2.      The economic and statistical research facilities ofthe Ministry of Transport have, therefore, been greatly strengthened.    Earlier this year a Director General ofEconomic Planning was appointed.   He is supported by a stafjof professional economists, including a MathematicalAdvisory Branch and a group working on problems of investment appraisal over the whole transport field.3.     The Directorate has started by concentrating itsefforts on short-run projects aimed at providing informationof immediate value relevant to forecasting demand,assessing coots and calculating the effect of proposals forsolving the most pressing problems,.    The MathematicalAdvisory Branch is mainly concerned with the problems ofprocessing as much as possible of the work on computers.There will be many problems, both urban and inter-urban,where an economic model, which can be evolved with the aid of a computer, would help both to explain their nature and to explore them in depth, and also would be valuablefor prediction.   Another part of the research programme isan investigation of the economic aspects of urban planning,which will assess the effects of transport policies on urbaiplanning and development in the widest sense.A,...   r:.Q   ...
4.      At the same time, the longer-term future is not beingneglected.    It will he evident from other parts of this white Paper that extensive investment in transport facilities will he required in the remaining years of thiscentury.    It is likely that large sums will be spent on research, and the techniques of cost effectiveness must beused, first to get the right priorities and then to ensure a continuing check of costs against the likely return.Applied technical and scientific research will be more effective if related closely to Information on populationtrends and other social forecasts;    the growth of income and in particular the proportion likely to he spent on various forms of transport;    and the forecasting ofindustrial and passenger demand for transport services.   Allthese studies form part of the Government&apos;s new approach to continue planning, in which greater emphasis is being placedon closer collaboration between the Government Departmentsconcerned, and between them and the local authorities.Technological Rese^ajrch and Development5.      The solution of economic problems, though crucial tothe development of an effective framework for transport, isonly part of the picture.    We must make the most of ourtechnological skills and resources to improve transportequipment.    The latest scientific techniques are being usedin dealing with a range of practical problems.   An exampleis the experiment in reduced journey times throughcentralised computer control of traffic being introduced at about 70 signal intersections and 30 pedestriancrossings in an area of 65- square miles in West London.    Acomplementary experiment is being under oaken in glasgow.    Plans are being prepared for the use of a computeras a basis for the whole of the vehicle and drivinglicensing system in the early 1970s.    This is a majorundertaking which will eliminate much of the routine workrn /inherent
inherent in the present methods.    Additionally, thiscomputer will play a direct part in the administration ofthe heavy goods vehicle testing scheme, providing a comprehensive store of information about vehicles andtheir drivers which can be analysed in ways possible only with a computer, and aiding road safety by providingefficient means of tracing vehicles and their drivers, thusassisting enforcement by the police.    A new large computerhas been ordered for research work at the Road research laboratory.6.      There is little obvious connection between the diversetechnological problems confronting different sectors of thetransport industry, and for this reason there has never been any single research and development organisation for transport.    Resoxirces have tended to be deployed inparticular sectors.    In land transport, there are theRailways Board&apos;s and London Transports research anddevelopment organisations, bodies such as the Motor IndustryResearch Association and the Civil Engineering ResearchAssociation, both partly financed, by the Ministry of technology, and several research groups wholly financed by industry.7.      The advances being made are considerable.    For example,the Railways Board&apos;s Research Department is probably ahead,   of the world in the techniques of operating steel wheels on steel rails, of fundamental importance to the further development of high-speed rail transport;    and the Board&apos;snew electrification system is acknowledged to be in the forefront.    London Transport lead in automatic operation oftheir kind of railway;    they already have an experimentalsection of line carrying passengers between Hainault andWoodford, and the new Victoria line, now under construction,will be automatically operated throughout.
A 7 &quot;18.      The Road Research Laboratory, for which the Ministerof Transport assumed direct responsibility in April 1965,has a world-wide reputation and standing in road construction techniques, and in traffic and safety researchas well.    To assist in the co-ordination of all road research the Advisory Council on Road Research has been setup to advise the Minister, and, as appropriate, the secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales, upon theorientation and scope of research on roads and road traffic.9.     But the main interests of these research groups havebeen, quite properly,  devoted to the problems of their particular part of the transport system.    None isorientated, or equipped, to study and experiment withsystems which radically differ from, and which may supersede,those now operated.    The nationalised transport undertakingshave been short of money for research.    In industry development is, in the main, undertaken specifically forstated requirements of operators or users.10.    The total public investment in research and developmentdirectly identifiable with transport (excluding aircraft,ships and hovercraft) is of the order of  5 million a year.This is not a large sura, particularly since much of thedevelopment financed is directed to the improvement and modernisation of existing forms of public transport.    Thereis no lack of ideas, but the country clearly cannot afford to pursue them all to a conclusion.    Valuable research anddevelopment effort needs to be guided along channels that hearsome realistic relationship to the possibilities of futurecapital investment in new systems, or in modernisation.    Forexample, the continuing modernisation of the railways must behacked by a research and development programme that will enablethem to hold their rightful place in an advanced technologicalenvironment.- 61 - /11.
62 -11.    But the new possibilities which are continually appearingwill not be ignored.    The Government has decided that research and development in inland transport should be expanded underthe guidance of the Ministry of Transport0    The aim   will be two-fold:-   first? to meet the needs of the Government wherethe development of equipment Is required in support of possible policies;    and second, to ensure that new ideas are properly examined in the light of the problems facing thecountry.    The Ministry will work in close co-operation with theMinistry of Technology and the National Research development corporation, and as much use as possible will be made of theskills and facilities that exist in Government research establishments.    Items which will be given first consideration for support will be the exploitation of the full potentialities of our railways to give higher speeds, greater comfort and safety;    the development of automatic fare collection machine and of road pricing mechanisms;    the experimental developmentof prototypes of a guided bus system and a novel kind of urban transport svst^Trt an tubes (which may be on the surface,underground or elevated.; ;    and a new study of the possibilitiesof applying existing technological knowledge to the solutionof the problems of mass transport in city centres.    In themore basic fields of research, the techniques of tunnelling.,the intractable problem of storage of electrical energy asa possible power supply for road vehicles, and new forms ofelectric traction will all be further studied.
X:      SUMMARY1. Pour basic themes have shaped the Government&apos;s transport policy:(i) the transport infrastructure and servioes (rail,road, ports,  etc.) must be modernised.    Sincetotal resources are limited, this means planninginvestment as a whole, increasing productivity and developing better criteria to assist choice;(ii) the problem of traffic conditions in towns mustbe given greater priority.    Here again thesolution lies in integrated planning.    new machinery is needed for the conurbations, wherethe problem is most acute;(iii) the transport system must take account of thesocial, as well as the economic, needs of thecountry;(iv) public transport must play a key role in solvingour transport problems. Publicly-owned road and rail services must be integrated on a functionalbasis.British Railways2.    As a starting point for development the size of the basic railway network is to be defined and stabilised.Details are now being considered by the Regional economic planning Councils and will be published as soon as possible.3o    The Government will assume responsibility for the losses on services retained for social reasons, or on wider cost/benefit grounds, though   the loss on such services which meetmainly local needs may ultimately be assumed by the local community.    The Railways Board will then be given realisticfinancial objectives to assist them to move as soon aspossible to a fully economic basis of operation.A- 6 3 -

The Government and the Railways Board are jointlyundertaking a study of the Board1s finances to determine an acceptable oasis for meeting-: the deficit, arising/frpm &quot;sociallynecessary&quot; services:    the study will also cover othermatters, including the suitability of the Board&apos;s management structure and procedures in the light of other changes proposed in the White Paper.5.     The Government will make available capital for the modernisation and development of the railways on an economic basis, particularly for those tasks for which it is best suited - carriage of freight in bulk, inter-city passenger services and commuter services in conurbations.6,     The Government is reviewing with the Railways Boardand the trade unions the structure of railway pay and vt/aysof improving productivity and efficiency.A National Freight Plan7*     The Government is proposing to establish a nationalfreight organisation with responsibility initially forthe general merchandise and sundries traffic at presentCarried by the British Railways Board and the TransportHolding Company.

The objectives of the expanded programme must be toprovide an effective inter-urban trunk route network,  andto put increasing emphasis on the relief of urban traffic congestion.1D. Techniques for road investment appraisal are beingimproved to ensure we choose schemes which give highestbenefit to the community.ih.    The Government has accepted the main recommendations ofthe Working Party of the EDO for the Civil engineering industry that has been examining costs and productivity inroad construction,  and is acting on them.15.   The Government proposes to establish Road ConstructionUnits in which Ministry and county engineers will work together on design and construction work for motorway and trunk road schemes.16.    A new long-term programme for dealing with roadaccidents is being worked out and will be published later.Urban Transport17.   Land use and transport in our towns must be plannedtogether as part of an integrated whole.    The land use/transportation studies being undertaken in all the conurbations will provide a sound basis for such planning.180   A traffic plan is needed in every major town or city:this must include a comprehensive parking policy to keeptraffic routes clear of parked cars and to keep total parkingspace in balance with the capacity of the road system.I. /19.- 65 -

Investment control proceduresare being strengthened to secure that the projects approvedyield the highest possible benefits to the community.28.    Port authorities and other port operators are to receiveinvestment grants of 20/6 as approved expenditure on plant and mechanical equipment in harbours and on harbour works(excluding land).29.    In order to secure a drastic reduction in the number ofemployers of dock workers, a licensing system will beintroduced under the provisions of the Docks and HarboursBill.    This will make a major contribution to the improvementof industrial relations and efficiency in ports.30.    The financial and charges structures of the ports are tobe modernised,  to ensure that port charges are based oneconomic costs.31.    The Government intends,  for the   long   term,  to reorganisethe ports on the basis of public ownership, with a strongNational Ports Authority and Regional Port Authorities.Inland Waterways32.

Preamble and terms of^reference for the JointSteering Group and Expert forking party . The Government has reached the conclusion that forthe foreseeable future there will he a need, as part ofthe- country1 s transport system,  for a substantial railwaynetwork,    In order to restore stability to an industry which has been the subject of continual change and uncertainty, and to enable management and staff to concentrate on the development of the system in the interestsof the public and of trade and industry, the Government hasdecided that the basic size of the railway network shouldbe determined now.    It will consist primarily of routeslinking the main centres of population and of industry and commerce, with additional routes to serve major freight traffic flows and to provide essential passenger services for commuters and others.    There are still some lines,services and stations whose retention in modern conditionscan no longer be justified, and their future will bedecided under the usual procedure as soon as possible toavoid prolonging uncertainty.2. The Government and the Railways Board are determined that this stabilised rail system shall play a full partin the transport system of the country and do so withrapidly increasing economic efficiency.    Capital will beprovided for the replacement of rolling stock and the modernisation of traction systems and of track andsignalling wherever this can be justified!in economic terms.Investment will be concentrated on the main trunk routescarrying heavy flows of traffic, but other feeder andcommuter lines will also be adapted to modern needs./3.- 69 -
3. The social and other considerations which have led to the decision to stabilise the rail network also make it necessary to substitute a new financial framework for that imposed by the Transport Act 1962.    It hasbecome clear that the requirement contained in the Actfor the Board to &quot;pay its way&quot; by the beginning of 1968 is entirely unrealistic and would, if pursued, force it into action which in many cases would he against the interestsof the community and inconsistent with the plans for transport and other services which the Government is developing.    It must therefore he amended to provide more realistic and appropriate financial objectives and a new financial framework and discipline.k.        Against this background the Minister of transport and the Chairman of the Railways Board have agreed toundertake a review of certain aspects of the railwayindustry.    Por this purpose they have set up a JointJointSteering Group under the chairmanship of the/parliamentary secretary to the Ministry of Transport.    The Croupincludes, in addition to representatives of theBoard, led by the Vice-Chairman, and of GovernmentDepartments, two independent industrialists and a workingrailwayman.5. The Joint Steering Group will he assisted by an expert working party, consisting as necessary of independent accountancy and management consultants and including economists from the ministry&apos; s new DirectorateGeneral of Economic Planning, and by a number of JointMinistry/Railways Board teams investigating particularsubjects.
