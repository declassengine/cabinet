THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1966G(66)98 Copy No.   677th July, 1966CABINETA BRITISH LIGHT AIRCRAFT industry memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Economic affairs at their meeting on 4th July (ED (66) 17th Meeting, Minute 1)the Ministerial Committee on Economic Development approvedproposals by the Minister of Aviation for the acquisition by theGovernment from the Pressed Steel Company Limited of the BeagleAircraft Company.History and background. The Pressed Steel Company Limited started Beagle in 1960to develop and manufacture a range of light aircraft. By the end of1965 they had invested nearly  5 million in it. Pressed Steel, now a subsidiary of the British Motor Corporation (BMC), do not want tocontinue with Beagle; BMC wish to concentrate their resources onactivities related to making and selling motor cars, and regard lightaircraft as being too remote from their main functions.3. For some months the Minister of Aviation has been considering, and discussing with Pressed Steel and BMC, proposals to take over responsibility for Beagle. At the beginning of the year the proposal was for a 75 per cent Government interest; now PressedSteel would prefer to dispose of the whole concern, though they areprepared to leave 20 per cent of the purchase price in the business as an investment, if we want them to do so.4. Earlier this year General Dynamics Corporation of theUnited States made a thorough investigation of the company witha view to acquisition. They concluded that Beagle&apos;s range of aircraft had potentialities, and that by 1972 or 1973 the company could bea profit-making concern and could begin to show a positive, thoughmodest, return on capital invested in it. They decided, however, notto acquire Beagle themselves, because the prospect of profitabilitywas too remote (and there is some suspicion that they werediscouraged by the United States Government from the acquisitionof Beagle).  General Dynamics have, however, undertaken to assist7025
Beagle with marketing their aircraft. Beagle have also made arrangements with two aviation corporations in the United States.All these arrangements with America could be an important help,because the bulk of the market for light aircraft is in the UnitedStates.5. Beagle have also reached agreement in principle for collaboration with Sud Aviation of France. This agreement providesnot for joint production but for market-sharing: each company would produce a range of aircraft, the two ranges would becomplementary and not in competition with each other and the two companies would aim to achieve an integrated network for sales and service of the joint range of aircraft.6. With the agreement of the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Development the Minister of Aviation undertook to finance Beagle while the negotiations with Sud Aviation were going on. We have now had to decide whether to take over permanentresponsibility for this company. If we do not do so, Pressed Steelwill wind it up on 31st July. If we do decide to take it over, PressedSteel will continue the Beagle company until we have obtained thenecessary powers, provided that the Government meet all thecompany&apos;s financial obligations in the meantime.Implications, and pros and cons7. Taking over the company would mean taking power toenable the Minister to acquire the undertaking, expenditure of something between  1 million and  3 million on acquisition, and theinjection of  2 million to  2^ million working capital over the next five years, until the company begins to make a profit. The return on capital would be modest: over a period of 13 years it wouldprobably not be much more than 6 per cent on a discounted cashflow basis.8. The Plowden Committee considered that the light aircraftend of the industry would eventually become commerciallyself-supporting and should not have Government assistanceindefinitely. It could conceivably be argued that it would be contrary to this view if the one company in this country exclusivelyconcerned with light aircraft were to be wholly or virtually whollyGovernment-owned. Nor, on the information available, does Beaglemake a very attractive investment proposition. But Britain ought tobe able to compete successfully in the light aircraft business, and inthe long run the balance of payments should benefit if we were ableto do so. It seems that Beagle is the only going concern that provides a basis for a British light aircraft industry. If the Government donot now take responsibility for Beagle, it will be wound up, and our chances of establishing a successful light aircraft industry will be considerably, and perhaps permanently, set back. A total investment of  4 million to  5 million over five years, with the reasonable prospect of a modest return thereafter, does not seem an unduly high price to pay for keeping Britain in this business, compared with otherexpenditures in the aircraft industry.
Department of Economic Affairs, S.W.1,5th July, 1966.conclusion. The Ministerial Committee on Economic Developmentagreed, with some misgivings, that the Government should acquireBeagle from Pressed Steel and provide it with the working capitalneeded to establish it as a profitable concern. This approval was subject to satisfactory terms of acquisition: the Minister of Aviationthought that he would be able to bring Pressed Steel down from the 3 million which is Pressed SteeFs valuation on a &quot; going concern &quot;basis to t\\ million or less, on the basis that the Government wouldnot be willing to pay more than the break-up value of the assets.The Committee also agreed that the Government would not? be interested in leaving a proportion of the equity with Pressed Steelunless Pressed Steel were prepared to provide a correspondingproportion of the further working capital required over the next five years. It seems unlikely that separate legislation will be requiredto give the necessary powers: we shall have to take legislation inany case to provide the powers that will be needed to enable theGovernment to participate in other sectors of the aircraft industry,and that legislation could probably cover the acquisition of Beagleas well. Even if that were not possible, it might prove that thePresident of the Board of Trade already had powers that could beused for this purpose; this possibility is being further investigated.We shall need to strengthen the management of the company byappointing a first-class full-time managing director and, until such time as we can acquire the undertaking, a part-time GovernmentDirector with financial experience, to look after our interest.10. I am reporting the Committee&apos;s decision to the cabinet for information, both because what is proposed is a measure of nationalisation, though in a small way, and because we should have it in our minds as part of the background to consideration of ourwider policy for the aircraft industry, which we shall shortly behaving to discuss.tt G.
