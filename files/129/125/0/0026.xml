THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1966C (66) 76 Copy No.    6 710th June, 1966CABINETBRITISH POLICY TOWARDS LATIN AMERICAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in the course of the oral report about my visit to Latin Americawhich I made to my colleagues on 20th January I undertook to circulate a paper giving my impressions. In the following paragraph I lay before my colleagues these impressions and seek their agreement to my conclusions.Political considerations2. Latin America is a test case in the struggle to bring the under-developed countries of the world forward to self-sustaininggrowth in freedom. On the basis of per capita income latin american countries occupy a position between Europe and thoseof Africa and Asia. If the more advanced Latin American countries with their European background, their relatively high rate ofliteracy, their proved capacity in technology, their existing industrialbase and their great untapped resources cannot cross the line andjoin the ranks of the developed world, the prospect for other countriesin the under-developed v/orld is bleak. Latin America is going through a critical phase in which the tide of expectations is risingswiftly. Unless enough of these expectations are met, the socialmalaise which already exists could worsen and lead to political andeconomic breakdown and a resort to extreme political forms withadverse consequences for our interests.3. We cannot stand by and watch this happen because in theworld balance of power the 20 republics of Latin America carry a decisive weight. In the struggle for competitive co-existence theadhesion of Latin America to Communism would decisively swingthe balance against ourselves and our allies. Keenly aware of this fact, the United States Government considers the area moreimportant than any other to its security. An illustration of theimportance to us of Latin America is at hand in the United Nations.Without the support of the Latin Americans there would be no possibility of the West producing a blocking third in the general assembly.   We need wide Latin American support (hitherto not6938A
2CONFIDENTIALalways forthcoming) to get acceptance for constructive british proposals. On Rhodesia the attitude of Argentina, Uruguay andBolivia has been crucial and we have seen how helpful it was tohave the Panamanian Government on our side.4. I found that the Peruvian, Chilean and ArgentineGovernments have the kind of programmes and policies for whichwe have a natural sympathy. It seemed to them and it seems to methat we as a Government and as a country are particularly well suited to help with the problems of Latin America. I believe that bothduty and self-interest require us to respond. But in recent yearsBritain has done very little. In two wars we were very largely cut off from the area whilst the United States, both from inclination andnecessity, was extending its influence. We had to concentrate ontransforming an Empire into a Commonwealth, which enjoyed a natural priority because of the bond of a common language. when we did look to the Latin American area, either our energies tended tobe absorbed in our Caribbean possessions or we found alien politicalsystems and nationalist policies which made us even more ready to turn to areas which we administered, or strongly influenced, and where language was no barrier. The building of the Commonwealthhas almost been completed. Experience in the Middle East, asia and Africa of the internal and external political conduct of the states which have emerged from colonial rule and European influence hasshown Latin America in a new context as the most stable, mature,advanced and powerful area of the developing world. I believe thatwe must look at Latin America in this light and, taking advantageof the considerable residual goodwill towards us which exists, devoteincreasing attention to the area.5. Fortunately in the expensive field of defence we can leaveLatin America to the Americans. But in the political field, and indeed the economic, this is not the case. All the Latin american countries recognise that the United States is and will remain the dominant outside Power in Latin America, but they urgently need to develop increasingly close relations with the countries of Europe.Otherwise the existing resentment of United States predominance islikely to develop into a bitter struggle against it, which would not bein our general interests. The need for a balance is felt by mostLatin Americans and is understood by the United States. It wouldexist even if the policies of the United States were wholly benevolentand always correct. The fact that United States policies in latin america are often controversial makes it all the more important thatwe, the Commonwealth, and other European countries should bemore active in the region. It causes me concern that at present wehave less consultation with the United States Government onLatin America and less influence on what they do there than in anyother part of the world. The Dominican affair is unlikely to be thelast in which the United States will take controversial action.Whether we like it or not we shall then be obliged to take a publicposition in the United Nations and in Parliament. We should notdelude ourselves into thinking that we shall easily be able to change
United States policies in Latin America, but it remains important tobe able to carry on an independent dialogue with the Latin american countries, to form our own estimate of their situation, to explain our attitude privately to the United States Government, to influence them as far as we can and on occasion to say publicly that we have ourown view which we have urged on them. If we have to be critical of the United States in public about Latin America, this is likely tohave consequences for Anglo-American relations generally. In orderto assert the right to criticise them when necessary, we must make every effort to be in a position from which to influence thembeforehand. We can do this only if we are seen to be active inLatin America.Economic considerations6. Our political presence in Latin America cannot be divorced from trade, aid and technical assistance. At the moment we supplyonly 7 per cent of Latin America&apos;s imports of manufactures half our average share of world-wide trade in these items and this in a market importing  3,000 million worth of goods a year (bigger thanthe whole of Africa north of the Limpopo and the Indiansub-continent put together) and with the fastest growing population in the world, which will almost have trebled (to  600 million) by theend of the century. This population already has more than twice the per capita purchasing power of the Afro-Asians and is increasingits lead in this respect. Provided that recent rates of growth are maintained, by the end of the century the total purchasing powerof the area can be expected to have increased by at least 500 per cent.Comparing 1964 with 1958, while our exports to Latin America roseby less than 1 per cent, Germany increased hers by 5 per cent, Italyby 17 per cent, France nearly 25 per cent, and Japan over 100 percent. The percentage of our aid allocated to Latin America is notproportionate to its political importance or its economic potentialities.In each of the past two years our total annual capital aid to latin america amounted to between  3 and  4 million, the bulk of this being for refinancing. The equivalent figure for Africa south of theSahara in 1965 was over  57 million, none of it for refinancing. our total technical assistance to Latin America is running at a level ofabout  625,000 a year, compared with  17 million last year for africa south of the Sahara. Similarly, the British Council is spending 500,000 a year in Latin America compared with  700,000 in africa south of the Sahara.7. Unlike many other less developed countries, a numberof Latin American countries are at the relatively advanced stage atwhich quite small amounts of capital aid can produce high returnsin terms of economic development, and it will be to our advantage to channel what development aid we can afford in their direction.Although I recognise that our present situation precludes any large-scale diversion of aid resources to Latin America, I hope thatit will be possible, within the aid ceiling, modestly to increase thelevel of our capital aid to the area during the rest of the decade. We6938
should also expand our present programme in agriculture andtechnical education. Technical assistance is not only one of the most effective contributions which we can make, within our limited resources, to the economic development of the area: it also (likerelatively small amounts of capital aid for development andrefinancing) produces trade benefits.8. Given my assessment of the weight of Latin America in the modern world, we should in future take care to consult the latin american countries more closely on international commercial andcommodity matters than we have done in the past. Even when their interests do not coincide with ours, we shall gain credit from being seen to take them into account.9. I am well aware that our Departments have in the past, andmore than once, examined possible ways of encouraging UnitedKingdom trade with Latin America, and that on the last occasion the Board of Trade broadly concluded that the economic prospectsby themselves did not justify an increase in official or unofficialpromotion of exports and investment. I realise that a freshexamination might confront us with difficulties similar to thoseencountered before, but I am convinced that the Government must now pursue a more active policy in Latin America, and be preparedto give the area a higher priority than at present, for reasons of bothimmediate political and long-term economic advantage. I amthinking here not only of the natural expansion of the Latin Americanmarket but also of the need to reinsure there against the economic consequences of adverse political developments elsewhere.10. I therefore believe that we should now look once more atthe economic picture, partly to bring past studies up to date, butprincipally to discover whether the agreement on the politicalnecessity to cultivate Latin America would not lead us to view our economic and commercial prospects in the area in a differentperspective.11. As a first step in the direction which I am advocating, weshould examine the opportunities for British trade in the area and suggest what action Her Majesty&apos;s Government might take to achievean increase in our trade there. In particular I would hope that wecan identify the fields in which increased efforts would be likely tooffer the best and quickest returns or in which we stand to lose mostby inactivity; suggest how prejudice against Latin America amongBritish exporters might be overcome; and consider the possibilityof improvements in existing Government facilities which, withoutunacceptable increases in cost, might help to increase our trade withthe area. I have in mind, for example, increased efforts to identify the exports most likely to do well in particular countries; possiblechanges of detail in credit policy and practice; such specialpromotions and extra financial support for business missions as might assist sales of British goods in particular countries at particulartimes; and such measures as may be possible to facilitatecollaboration by British firms in local production and in improving the efficiency of local sales outlets for facilities and stocks.
12. Although I am sure that it is a mistake to tar latin american countries with the same brush, the broad conclusions whichI have outlined in this Memorandum are those which I have reached as a result of my visit to three of the countries and from discussions at the conference over which I presided in Lima of all the ambassadors and High Commissioners in the area. these conclusions can be crystallised into the following three principles which should, I suggest, guide us in formulating future British policy towards Latin America:(a) It is an important British interest that Latin America should remain in the free world and that we should do what wecan to help the Latin Americans to achieve self-sustaininggrowth in freedom as quickly as possible;(b) It is equally in our interest in the long term to increase our share of the growing Latin American market;(c) Both these interests require a more active British presence in the political, cultural and, above all, the economicfield; greater priority therefore needs to be given both toLatin America in general and in particular to selectedcountries in the area.13. I hope that I shall have the support of my colleagues inputting these principles into practice. This will entail making available the necessary resources for the purpose. These resourceswill be relatively small. They will be needed for some of themeasures I have indicated above and, for instance, for staff,communications facilities, British Council activities and increasedcontacts with trade unionists, students, journalists, the military and indeed the opinion-forming groups as a whole. The first step is thatwe should accept the realities of the part which Latin America nowplays in the world and act accordingly. From this much will flow.M.
