HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C(66) 673rd May, 1966COPY NO.67CABINETMINISTRY OF SOCIAL SECURITY BILL;ADMINISTRATIVE ARRANGEMENT3Memorandum by the Minister of Pensions and national insurance was invited by the Cabinet (CC(66) 21st Conclusions, Minute 3)to arrange with the Chancellor of the Exchequer for urgent considerationof the possibility of undertaking, during the interval between the third reading of the Bill in the House of Commons and the receipt of royal assent (about mid-November), the administrative work necessary tobring the new scheme of non-contributory benefits into operation in thelast week in November, and to report on any special steps considered necessary.    These considerations fall under three heads, operational,legislative and public relations.Operational2.      Providing that the Parliamentary timetable envisaged by theCabinet is adhered to, I cannot say that what was proposed isoperationally impossible, subject to the appointed day being deferred until 12th December, as to which see the Annex.    But the consequences of attempting to introduce the scheme in this fashion could, in my judgment, be disastrous.    I set out in the Annex an analysis of theeffects of the proposal, which can be summarised thus;-(i) The burden on the administrative machine would be increased at a time when it is bound to be under severe pressure; andthere would be a real risk of breakdown. Even if this wereavoided, the quality of service must suffer. ((ii) A vital feature of the scheme - allowing old people to claim on a written return of income - could no longer be introduced at the outset.    In addition the pilot scheme for the intro-duction of combined order-books would have to be deferred,possibly for some months.(iii)  The publicity programme would be seriously weakened - Icomment separately on this in paragraph 5.Legislative3.      Public money must of course be spent, in effect to implement the Bill, before Royal Assent had been given.    But this is not theimportant factor.    It would be impossible to take account from theappointed day of any changes (whether favourable or otherwise) broughtabout by amendments made after the Summer reces3.    The appointed
day must be announced in July and it would then be plain that a schemenot yet approved by Parliament was for all practical purposes being implemented.    Claims to benefit would be invited and followed up bya home visit to obtain a full statement of the claimants circumstances,before a statutory scheme existed to which the statement could relate.A practical difficulty which troubles me is that the results of the visit,whenever made, could not be communicated to the claimant until earlyDecember.4.       One cannot say that all this rules out what has been proposed,but plainly it involves treating Parliament and particularly the Houseof Lords with scant courtesy, to which serious exception might well betaken;  and in so far as controversy developed about these matters thepublic standing of our scheme would be damaged.    Since the main purpose of the scheme is to secure better public - and political -acceptance of a means-tested benefit I would deplore the creation of controversy over a Bill which, as to merit, will I am sure command general approval.    Circumstances could arise in which, for the reason explained in paragraph 4 of the Annex, payments would unavoidably bemade in excess of what Parliament authorised; though this might bethought a very unlikely contingency it could be dealt with by express &apos;authority if it arose.    A more real risk is that Royal Assent might be delayed beyond mid-November by the need to deal with Lords amend-ments of a kind which commanded popular support.    If the Bill were infact delayed beyond mid-November the situation would be lamentable:awards would be further delayed, the revision of order books alreadyprepared would soon become impossible and, with Christmas imminent,there is a risk that the whole operation would have to be called off forthe time being.Public relations.       The dominant consideration in my view is the public relationsaspect,    I remind my colleagues again that I shall shortly be publishing the results of my Survey of Retirement Pensioners, which will bring out the failure of large numbers of old people to apply for national assistance.    Many will see this as an argument for higher pensions.The aged non-pensioners too are building up substantial political interestand support.    The Ministry of Social Security Bill is our answer.    Thenew scheme ought, in my view, to be introduced by a well-planned andvigorously executed publicity campaign backed by efficient and humaneadministration.    The latter already exists, and with my original programme neither efficiency nor humanity would be endangered;  andwith Royal Assent by the summer recess I should have no difficulty in ensuring the sort of publicity we need.    With Royal Assent deferred until mid-November the publicity campaign could not take place in theway I had envisaged and would indeed have to be stopped completely atRoyal Assent, i.e. the natural time for making the greatest effort.And, because of the overload on the administration, there could well be serious delays in handling the day-to-day business of meeting immediateneed as well as dealing with new claims to the new benefits: it wouldnot be practicable to give priority to cases of urgent need because only after investigation could the degree of urgency be established.-2-
6.       What in fact would happen can be summarised thus:-Snd July;    I should have to announce that, subject to theapproval of Parliament, the scheme would operate from 12th december and that administrative work to implement it would be started at once.iAugust;   The staff of the National Assistance Board would start re-assessing the two million existing national assistance cases.Early October:   Explanatory leaflets and claim forms wouldbe made available locally, but all the information about the schemev/ould have to be on the basis that it was contingent on parliamentary approval, and advance publicity would thus lose much of its impact.Worse still, there being no Ministry of Social Security and noCommission, it would have to be explained that claims would be handled at the offices of the National Assistance Board, in that name.October-November:     National Assistance Board local officersv/ould be visiting new claimants and taking declarations of circumstancethey would necessarily go out as Board&apos;s officers and introducethemselves as such.   Concurrently, we should be repeating in the Lordsdebates that the intention of the scheme was to get away from themisconceptions associated with national assistance.Late November:    The Minister and Commission would beappointed.December:    The benefit s would be paid, but with no advancenotification of the amount awarded.    For the reasons explained inparagraph 5 of the Annex there could be no publicity at this stage at all.Also I should have had to explain the deferment of two attractive feature of the scheme - see paragraph 2 above.January-February:     The full-blooded and unconditionalpublicity campaign which I had envisaged for September-Octobermight begin if, so soon after the main operation and at a particularly difficult time of year, the administrative machine could handle thespate of claims which might be expected to result.conclusion.       The best - indeed the only - programme I can offer is set out above.    No additional influx of staff or special dispensations canimprove it at this stage.    In my judgment it coSipviSo^ disastrouslythe public standing of the new scheme at a time when we shall beexpected to set out vigorously to establish it as an accepted and fundamental part of social security and as the answer to the situation disclosed by my Survey.8.       I must urge my colleagues that v/hat heeds to be done to assureRoyal Assent before the summer recess should be done.M.K.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, W.C.2.2nd May, 1966-3-SECRET
ANNEX    1 66OPERATITJjAL ASPECTS1,     No benefits can be paid under the Bill until the Minister (who willhave the duty of paying them) is appointed and has appointed the Commission,who will have the statutory duty of awarding benefit.   Given Royal Assentby mid-November, the earliest date by which the Minister and Commission couldbe appointed under the Act would not allow new benefit payments to be mademuch before 12th December, which is also the earliest date operationallypossible.   The appointed day could not be made later because of the riskof payments being delayed in the post before Christmas.2,     Existing recipients of national assistance would have their order books renewed as usual.   Some orders in these books would be due forencashment after the appointed day at their existing national assistancerate, and after the Commission had been appointed the payees would,beprovided with an additional book for the increase due under the new scheme.This procedure requires about one million more order books and a great many more man-hours than my original plan,   (Under the original plan about halfof the national assistance recipients would have been provided, as their cases came up for review week by week, with renewal order books reflectingthe higher rate from the appointed day.)   I can get the million more order books, although there has not been time to consult the Post Office about the praticability of encashing the extra orders immediately before Christmas,The man-hours required to prepare the extra books can only come from makingyet further demands on the staff, at a time when they would in any case be under the severest pressure.   Starting the reassessment programme on1st August, the earliest date by which they could finish would be the first week in December, books being despatched   in the week beginning 5th Decemberfor payment on 12th December,   During these eighteen-nineteen weeks theNational Assistance Board staff would be working the maximum overtime that ,is practicable.   All the time the ordinary work - some of the most taxingin the social services - must go on.   The risk of breakdown could not bebrushed aside.   Strong representations are already being made&apos;by the staff associations about the strain on the staff and risks for the public whichplainly lie ahead;   and of course they have no inlcLing of the latestproposal.(1)
(2)SECRET3o     Three further points must he made about the reassessment period August - end Novembers(i)   The start of reassessment oould not be deferred beyond 1st Augustwithout pushing the appointed day into the Christmas postalperiod.(ii)   Once the programme has started no changes in the scheme(beneficial or otherwise) could be incorporated in the order books prepared for the appointed day,(iii)   Tho third reading in the House of Commons must, therefore, besecured by 1st August if benefits are to be paid this year,(iv)   The appointed day would have to be announced when the Billleaves the House of Commons and regardless of the feelings of the House of Lords, or of complications arising from anyLords1 amendment s a4-*     The fact that amendments made as a result of the lords  considerationof the Bill could not be incorporated in the additional books means thatany beneficial amendments would have to be implemented at a later date,with arrears, as order books were renewed.   If the amendments resulted in less favourable allowances to particular individuals (amendments which wereunfavourable overall can no doubt be ruled out) overpayments must result;and special provision would have to be made to cover this irregularity.Effect on the scheme5.     Handling of new claims.   Under my original plan the main publicitydrive to attract claims to the new benefit from people not already receivingnational assistance was planned to start not less than two months beforethe appointed day.   But no publicity drive could be contemplated duringthe period of perhaps no more than two weeks which would elapse under thenew timetable between Royal Assent and the appointed day.   If new claims were made in substantial numbers during this very short period, the effect could only be to produce serious delays.   Widespread delays would sour the atmosphere of goodwill on which we have counted to start off the new scheme.But this is not the most serious consideration.   The claims coming in wouldbe of two kinds.   First there would be those claimants attracted by thenew scheme but not in urgent need, e.g. a pensioner with capital who onlyqualifies because of the higher disregards.   Secondly, many claims would come from people in urgent need who under present arrangements would have sought and obtained national assistance Immediately, e0g. a woman newlywidowed whose husband occupational pension has died with him or the family man suddenly incapacitated hy a road accident.   It would be impossible
to pick out these urgent cases for priority treatment because they oftencannot be identified before they have been investigated.   Some of these people would receive a greatly worsened service and would be temporarily in great hardship.   Such failure to meet real need promptly would provokestrong public reaction.   It is essential therefore that under the timetableremitted for consideration by the Cabinet any advance publicity for the new scheme should be brought to an end before Royal Assent and not resumeduntil the New Year.6.     Apart from this crucial difficulty the timetable would have otherconsequences detrimental to the impact of the new scheme.(i)   Claims would have to be invited on a contingent basis fcr a benefit under a Eill to which Parliament had not givenapproval,(ii)   Leaflets and claim forms would have to be provided for use by the public before Royal Assent,(iii)   Claims for the new benefit would have to be determined beforethe Commission exists, on a statement of circumstances which  I did not relate to any statutory scheme, and on which no decision could be given to the claimant until early December irrespective of the date of his application. ((iv)   Since the Ministry of Social Security and the Commission wouldnot exist, claim forms would have to be dealt with at AreaOffices of the National Assistance Board, in that name, and athome visits by local officers of the Board.   The presentationaldifficulties of this are obvious.7.     Publicity(i)   The publicity campaign I contemplated undertaking some two-months before the appointed day - which would have included full coveragein the press, radio and television, and posters - could not beundertaken in anything like the way I had envisaged;   there wouldbe no statutory scheme to publicise and publicity would therefore have to be conditional and half-hearted.   This impression of half-heartedness would be made worse by the fact that the passageof the Act, the creation of the new Ministry and Commission, the inception of the..new benefit would all occur when publicity hadto be suspended.(3)
(ii)   A full-blooded publicity campaign would still be required tosupport the new scheme;   but this could not he undertaken until after Christmas.   This means that up to some date in theNew Year we should have done little to tell new claimants abouta benefit that had been available from early December, and whichhad been approved by the House of Commons in July.   Apart fromthe general damage this would do to the Government&apos;s credit andto the image of the new scheme in its crucial early days, therewould no doubt be pressure from late claimants for back-dating to12th December.   This would, however, have to be resisted becauseof the administrative burdens   it would involve and the precedentit would create.(iii)   January and February are the heaviest months for local officesbecause of seasonal unemployment and sickness, and on any reasonable judgment they are the worst time   to have a publicity campaign and attract new claims.   One would therefore eitherhave to postpone the campaign until March or risk a deterioration in service in early 1967 which would further damage the image ofthe new scheme,8,     Postal declarations.   A feature of my proposals is that old people who prefer not to be visited in connection with their claim may make a written return.   This feature (which has been the subject of experiment)is only workable when the local office staff have time to follow up anyclaims where the old pei-son has said he wishes to send in a written returnbut fails to do so - otherwise there is a real risk of hardship arising.   Inthe situation described above there would not be staff time for this follow-up action during the period before or immediately after Christmas, so thatthis facility could not be offered to claimants until the New Year,   Anypublicity would have to make this clear,9.     Combined order books.   This innovation has already been publicised andseems to be an important attraction.   It is expensive in man-power duringthe transitional period of conversion of existing cases to combined books.For the same combination of reasons as apply to postal declarations, theoriginal proposal to introduce a pilot scheme in January 19&amp;7 would have tobe dropped;   and because work might be starting in the new Ministry inMarch-April 1967 in preparation for a general uprating of contributory and non-contributory benefits it might be impossible to mako even a start on the combined books operation until the late summer of that year.(4)
