A Plan for Polytechnicsand other Colleges
DRAFT WHITE PAPERA PLAN FOR POLYTECHNICS AND OTHER COLLEGESHigher Education in the Further Education SystemINTRODUCTION1. Much has changed since the White Paper of 1956 on technical education* and the introduction of the four-tier system of Colleges of advanced Technology, Regional Colleges, Area Colleges and Local Colleges.Following the recommendations of the Committee on Higher Education! in1963, under the Chairmanship of Lord Robbins the Colleges of advanced technology have been transferred to the university sector, and the council for National Academic Awards has been established to provide degrees forstudents in non-university institutions. In a recent report the NationalAdvisory Council on Education for Industry and Commerce has drawn attention to the need for the further concentration of courses in the interestsof the most effective use of resources. And the present Government have committed themselves to an even greater expansion of higher education than was forecast in the Robbins report. They have announced their intentionof developing a distinctive sector of higher education within the further education system to complement the universities and colleges of education.2. It is now necessary in the light of these developments to review theexisting pattern of provision of higher education in the Further Educationsystem of England and Wales. This the Government have done in consultationwith the national bodies representing the local education authorities andthe teachers in technical colleges, and with the National Advisory Councilon Education for Industry and Commerce and the Council for NationalAcademic Awards. Valuable help has been received from an informaladvisory group under the chairmanship of the then Joint Minister of Statefor Education and Science, Mr. Reg Prentice, M.P., consisting of individualswith experience of further education and of industry. The Government now propose a further evolution of the present pattern on the lines outlined inthis White Paper.3. The Government and the local education authorities have been puttingsubstantial and increasing resources into the technical, commercial and artcolleges since the White Paper of 1956 was published. The object of developing a new pattern now is to see that the rapidly mounting demandfor higher education within the system of Further Education is met in sucha way as to make the best possible use of these resources without prejudicingopportunities for the tens of thousands of less advanced students who wishto take courses at intermediate and lower levels. The Government believethat this can best be done by concentrating full-time courses of higher education as far as practicable in a limited number of strong centres withthe staff, buildings and equipment needed both to achieve and maintain high standards and to provide the right setting for an active community of staff and students.* Cmd. 9703.t Cmnd. 2154.36878a 2
the present position. Last year there were about 40,000 full-time and sandwich students inadvanced courses in technical, commercial and art colleges in England andWales. Of these students nearly 12,000 were working for degrees and 8,000for the Higher National Diploma (H.N.D.); almost half were sandwichstudents. About 7,000 of them were studying art. A further measure of the substantial scale of provision is that more than 100,000 students werestudying to obtain recognised qualifications by attending part-time day andevening courses at an advanced level. Of these about 2,500 were working fordegrees and more than 50,000 for Higher National Certificates (H.N.C.).These figures represent a remarkable achievement on the part of localeducation authorities and colleges. By their foresight and vigour in recentyears they have expanded provision in anticipation of the growing demand and simultaneously improved standards. This has set a firm foundation onwhich to build for the future.6. All but one of the 25 Regional Colleges and more than 30 AreaColleges and Colleges of Commerce are offering full-time degree courses.About 100 other colleges are providing full-time advanced courses and asimilar number offer only part-time courses at the same level. This does not include 40 Colleges of Art engaged in advanced work.7. The volume of advanced work varies greatly from college to college.25 have more than 500 full-time students; seven have more than 1,000. Atone extreme eight colleges have over 500 full-time degree students; at theother are nine colleges with fewer than 50 such students.8. The figures given in the preceding paragraphs refer to students incourses which are classified as &quot; advanced&quot; in the statistics of theDepartment of Education and Science. There are also growing numbers of students of 18 and over in other courses which are above G.C.E. Advancedlevel in standard but are not classified as &quot; advanced &quot;. References to &quot; higher education &quot; in this White Paper include courses of this type.44. Within higher education there are two other sets of students no less important than those who have the time and ability to take full-time orsandwich courses of degree standard. The first are those who are seeking aqualification that requires a course of higher education which is belowdegree standard; the second are the many thousands of students who, beingalready in employment, can find time only for part-time day and/ or eveningcourses, whether they lead to a degree or to a qualification below thatstandard. The Government believe it to be of the utmost importance thatthe leading colleges concerned with higher education should be comprehensivein the sense that they plan their provision of courses to meet the needs of students in all three categories. The comprehensive range and character ofthe work of these centres will broadly distinguish them from other kinds of higher education institution. As mixed communities of full-time and part-time teachers and students, they will as a whole have closer and more direct links with industry, business and the professions.
future needs &quot; 19. The National Plan* (paragraph 23, page 198) makes clear theGovernment^ intention that there should be available in 1969/70 in GreatBritain places for over 70,000 full-time and sandwich students followingadvanced courses in institutions of further education. This compares withthe estimate of 51,000 by 1973/74 put foiward in the Report of theCommittee on Higher Education. Over 60,000 of these places will be inEngland and Wales. This does not include the provision needed for the students referred to in paragraph 8 above. These combined demands for full-time and sandwich courses are likely to increase still further during thenineteen-seventies. Numbers of part-time students are also expected toincrease, though not at the same rate.future pattern10. It will be possible to meet these rapidly expanding needs and at thesame time to provide properly for the no less important needs of studentsat other levels only if a greater concentration of full-time higher educationcan be secured. The effect of distributing it as widely as at present is that many departments and colleges are too small to sustain high academicstandards and to provide a satisfactory corporate life. This also involves anuneconomical use of resources not least of teachers qualified to undertake the higher levels of work. A considerable measure of concentration is therefore essential.POLYTECHNICS11. The Government believe that the best results will be achieved by developing higher education on polytechnic lines wherever practicable. Thiswill enable staff and students to enjoy the advantage of belonging to institutionsoffering a wide variety of disciplines and it will concentrate expensive resources in fewer centres. The Secretary of State for Education and Science thereforeproposes, in full consultation with the Regional Advisory Councils forFurther Education, to designate a limited number of major centres in whicha wider range of both full-time and part-time courses can be developed. Ascomprehensive academic communities they will be expected to cater forstudents at all levels of higher education.12. In so designating the Secretary of State will take account of the likely demand for higher education places, the needs of industry, the availability of lodgings and other residential provision, and the desirabilityof achieving a reasonably balanced provision in different fields of study overthe country as a whole. Special attention will be given to the claims of regional and other colleges which have already established a reputation ascentres of higher education and at which highly qualified staff have beenappointed and substantial capital resources committed. It is proposed thatas a generic term these major centres should be called &quot; Polytechnics &quot;. Thiswill not prevent particular institutions from using their present or other titles.13. In some places the right course will be to develop a single collegeas a Polytechnic. But where two or more colleges in the same or neighbouringlocal education authority areas are substantially engaged in higher education* Cmnd. 2764, 1965.5
the authorities concerned will be encouraged to link them to form a strongerand better balanced unit. This might occur by the merger of existing collegesor of part of their work: in other cases some form of federal structure maybe appropriate. Care will be taken to respect existing relationships and totake into account special needs in particular fields of study.14. The Secretary of State aims to settle the list of Polytechnics for about ten years and not to add to it within this period. The purpose of this policyis to give the authorities and colleges concerned a firm foundation for thedevelopment of the designated colleges and to guide individual authorities,the Regional Advisory Councils and the Department of Education and Sciencein the allocation of resources. Other authorities and colleges will also know where they stand and will be able to concentrate on their responsibilities for other categories of students.15. When, after considering the advice of the Regional Advisory Counciland any views that may be submitted by the Regional Economic planning council the Secretary of State has decided in principle upon the establishmentof a Polytechnic, the local education authority or authorities concerned willbe invited to submit proposals for its constitution and development.Designation will be given only when the Secretary&apos; of State is satisfied thatthe proposed Polytechnic will be capable of making an effective long-termcontribution as a major centre of higher education. He will wish in particular to be satisfied that there are proper plans for the development of the workin appropriate fields of study on the comprehensive lines described above,and that wherever appropriate possibilities of merger or other arrangementsfor closer association between colleges have been fully explored. He will also need to be satisfied that the government of the Polytechnic will be onacceptable lines (see paragraph 25). But full account will be taken of variations in circumstances, and there may be exceptional cases requiring special treatment. Where appropriate, designation will be provisional in the firstinstance.16. In the long term the Polytechnics will be expected to concentratewholly or largely on students of 18 and over pursuing courses of higher education. Courses at other levels, however, may well continue for some timewhile the demand from higher education students is growing and pendingthe provision of satisfactory alternative facilities elsewhere.17. It is impossible to give any exact indication of the size that aPolytechnic should aim at achieving by a given date. This will depend bothon the level of regional and national demand and on the resources that canbe provided from time to time. It is unlikely, however, that the full educational and economic advantages of developments on polytechnic lines will be secured in institutions with less than about 2,000 full-time students and, while theremay be exceptions, the Polytechnics will normally be expected to have in mind&apos; long-term plans for growth to at least 2,000 full-time students plus part-timestudents from the areas they serve.18. The number of colleges to be designated as Polytechnics has not been fixed precisely in advance. It is an essential part of the Governmenfs policy that the selection shall be made in full consultation with Regional advisory councils and local education authorities, and the number will also be affected6
CONFIDENTIAL ,1by the extent to which it is possible to form mergers or federations. TheAppendix contains a summary of the preliminary proposals which are being sent to Regional Advisory Councils for consideration and gives an indication of the limited number of Polytechnics that the Secretary of State iscontemplating.OTHER CENTRES OF HIGHER EDUCATION19. While the aim of policy is that full-time and sandwich courses should as far as practicable be concentrated in the Polytechnics it is not intended that they should have a monopoly of full-time higher education within theFurther Education system. Their work will need to be supplemented bythat of many other colleges, particularly in specialist fields, and it is obviousthat higher education courses for part-time students will need to be distributedover a still larger number of colleges.specialist centres20. Special consideration will be given to the position of art and othercolleges which already have established reputations in specialist fields andto which substantial resources have been committed. In some cases the bestarrangement may be to include the college (or the relevant part of its work)in a Polytechnic; and in others the college may be able to establish academiclinks with a suitable Polytechnic. Full-time courses of higher education in specific professional fields such as art, architecture, agriculture, social work,management studies, nautical studies, institutional management and catering,which are already recognised under nationally settled arrangements, willcontinue if the need for them can be established in terms of current criteria forthe approval of courses. After progress has been made with the designationof Polytechnics the Secretary of State proposes, however, to review theprovision in these fields with the bodies concerned with a view to deciding whether any changes should be made in the existing pattern.full-time higher education at other colleges21. Existing courses will continue until they have been completed bystudents already in them or arrangements can be made to place the students in other courses.22. Full-time higher education must also continue where there arespecial needs which cannot be met by the Polytechnics and specialistcentres, and where there is adequate student support. These needs may bedue to special local circumstances, the impracticability of transfer to aPolytechnic until additional accommodation becomes available, or studentdemand that cannot be catered for otherwise. The test of need will be whether a proposal to continue or to launch a course satisfies the criteria for the approval of courses in force from time to time. It is not, however,proposed that colleges not already engaged in full-time higher educationshall embark on it save in exceptional circumstances. (The criteriacurrently in force are set out in Circular 11/66 issued by the Department ofEducation and Science on 12th April, 1966, and the report thataccompanied it on Size of Classes and Approval of Further EducationCourses of the Committee on Technical College Resources appointed bythe National Advisory Council on Education for Industry and Commerce.)7
part-time higher education23. In view of the travelling difficulties of many part-time students theremust be a wider distribution of part-time courses and while everything possible should be done to enable part-time higher education students totake advantage of the facilities of the major centres, it is intended thatcolleges at present offering H.N.C. and other part-time higher educationcourses shall continue them subject to the criteria for approval in force fromtime to time. Regional Advisory Councils and authorities will, however, beasked to examine the scope for the further concentration of particular fields of study at selected colleges in order to improve educational standards andto secure the most effective use of resources while taking reasonable accountof the travelling difficulties of part-time students. Colleges not already engaged in part-time higher education should not undertake it in the absenceof exceptional circumstances.24. Proposals for part-time degree courses will not be entertained fromcolleges which have no full-time higher education courses unless the course is to be conducted in close association with a Polytechnic or other collegethat is offering degree courses in the same field.GOVERNMENT OF COLLEGES25. Separate consideration is being given to the pattern of governmentand academic organisation appropriate to colleges engaged in full-time or part-time higher education, and the representative bodies will shortly be consulted about the guidance which should be given on this subject. It willbe a condition of the designation of Polytechnics that their arrangements are consistent with those recommended.RELATIONS BETWEEN POLYTECHNICS AND OTHEPv COLLEGES26. There will be great educational benefit in the establishment of closeacademic and other links between the Polytechnics and other collegesengaged in higher education, whether full-time or part-time, within the surrounding area. Authorities which are invited to prepare schemes for theestablishment of Polytechnics will be asked to take this into account, andthe Secretary of State hopes that all concerned will co-operate in developingsuch links to the fullest practicable extent. The Secretary of State is alsoanxious that mutually advantageous links with universities shall be developed through sharing of staff, joint use of communal and other facilities and in other ways.27. The Government believe that by contributing to the more economicuse of the resources available for further education generally the new arrangements will be of great benefit to all colleges and not only to thosewhich are engaged in full-time or part-time higher education. The courses which are offered at other levels are no less important to the community,and the existing area and local colleges in particular will have a special responsibility for meeting the rapid increases in demand that will result from the Industrial Training Act. Their invaluable contribution to the educational and economic needs of the nation must in no way be prejudiced by the development of higher education. The Government will continue togive them all possible support.8
SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS J28. (i) The decision to develop and expand higher education within theFurther Education system necessitates a review of the existing provisionwith the object of using the available resources to the maximum advantage in order to build up a strong and distinctive sector of higher educationwhich is complementary to the universities and colleges of education. Inparticular full-time and sandwich courses of higher education must be concentrated in a substantially smaller number of centres than at present.(ii) After full consultation with the Regional Advisory Councils andlocal education authorities concerned, the Secretary of State will designatea limited number of Polytechnics as the main centres for the futured development of full-time higher education within the Further Educationsystem. Though there will be no question of creating a rigid or ossifiedpattern irrespective of traditions and individual circumstances, the objectwill be to develop them as large and comprehensive institutions offeringfull-time, sandwich and part-time courses of higher education at all levels.The Secretary of State&apos;s preliminary proposals for the establishment ofPolytechnics are set out in the Appendix.(iii) Designation may be final or provisional in the first instance but itis not intended to add to the list of Polytechnics for at any rate about10 years. Before a Polytechnic is designated account will be taken of thepossibility of associating one or more colleges by merger or otherwise inorder to form a more effective unit. It will be a condition of designationthat the government and academic organisation are on acceptable lines.(iv) The object will be to reduce substantially the number of collegesengaged in full-time higher education but colleges not designated asPolytechnics will continue to offer full-time courses of higher educationwhere they satisfy the criteria for approval of courses in force from timeto time. Existing provision for courses in specific professional fields undernationally settled arrangements will be reviewed in due course.(v) Colleges already engaged in part-time higher education will continue with such work subject to the criteria for approval of courses in force fromtime to time.(vi) In the absence of exceptional circumstances colleges not already engaged in higher education will not be expected to embark on it.appendix the following preliminary proposals for the establishment of Polytechnicswithin their Regions are being sent to Regional Advisory Councils for advice. Where in the light of their views it is decided to proceed with aproposal to establish a Polytechnic, the local education authority or authorities concerned will be invited to prepare for consideration by theSecretary of State a scheme on the lines set out in this White Paper. (the colleges named are those which are substantially engaged in full-time andother higher education in the area and in the Secretary of State&apos;s view shouldprima facie be considered for inclusion in the list of Polytechnics.
