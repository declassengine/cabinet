THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OIlgg^-pRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 56 COPY NO,5th April, 1966CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1966-67Memorandum by the Lord President of the council the Future Legislation Committee and, subsequently, the Committeeon The Queen&apos;s Speech, have considered the Bills suggested by ministers for inclusion in the legislative programme for 1966-67.    In the listsannexed the Bills have been provisionally classified under the following heads :-A. 1    Essential Bills - that is, Bills which must be obtained bya particular date.A. 2    Contingent Bills - that is, Bills which may becomeessentialB       Main Programme Bills for the 1966-67 SessionC Bills in Reserve - that is, Bills which might be brought forward if gaps develop in the programme, but whichcannot have any priority in drafting.S        Bills suitable for the proposed Second Reading committed        Other BillsP       Bills suitable for Private Members2.      Far more Bills have been put forward for inclusion in next Session&apos;programme than could be fitted even in a long Session into the time availablefor Government legislation.    I have had representations from many of theMinisters concerned in favour of Bills which it has not been possible toinclude in the main programme for next Session, and I recognise the weightof their arguments.    I am anxious, however, that Members should not beasked to work during the coming Session under as much pressure as wasnecessary during the last two Sessions, and it would not be possible toinclude any more Bills in the main programme without postponing otherswith equal, or greater, claims.3.      Now that we are in a position to look ahead, I propose that the future legislation Committee should draw up provisional lists of the principal bills for the 1967-68 and 1968-69 Sessions so that we can plan a series of coherentprogrammes which will achieve a proper balance between our economic and social policies and will maintain impetus and interest during the lifetime ofthe Parliament.    Ministers are being asked to put forward long-term plans for legislation, so far as they can at present foresee them, and proposals willbe submitted to the Cabinet when these have been considered.4.      The Future Legislation Committee will also need to consider prioritieswithin List S, which contains more Bills than we are likely to be able to passby means of the Second Reading Committee procedure.5. At present we seek the approval of the Cabinet only for the provisional programme set cut in Lists A. 1, A. 2 and B and C of the Annex.SECRET H. B.Privy Council Office, S.W.1.5th April, 1966
