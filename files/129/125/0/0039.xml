C(66) 89 COPY NO.27th June, 1966CABINETCONCORDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs have seen the Minister of Aviation&apos;s memorandum (C(66) 88)on this subject and I support his recommendation that we must go ahead with the Concord.2.       The political repercussions of a unilateral British withdrawal(and all the indications are that the French are determined to go ahead)would be very damaging.    It would be hard to defend ourselves from thecharge that Britain was not a trustworthy partner.     Other collaborativeprojects could v/ell be prejudiced.    Nor would the political reper-cussions be confined to the additional strain which would be placed onour relations with France.    Our relationship with Europe as a wholecould suffer.    A unilateral British withdrawal could seriously shakethe confidence of the Five and of our NATO partners in our capacity to fulfil our obligations.M.S.Foreign Office, S.V/.1,.22nd June, 19667-US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)********  -        HW**.re**K &quot;^^^
