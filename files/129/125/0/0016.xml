DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)MINISTRY OF SOCIAL SECURITY bill memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in December last (C. C. (65) ?0th Conclusions, Minute 2) theCabinet approved the main features of a scheme for reshaping national assistance and a Bill designed to give effect to the scheme wasconsidered by the Legislation Committee on 26th April.2.      There are a number of issues outstanding in connection with    1this Bill:-(i)    Parliamentary timetable.(ii)   The timing and content of a statement on how the costof the scheme can be reconciled with the expenditurelimits laid down by the Cabinet.(iii)   The level of the new benefits to replace existingdiscretionary allowances and of &quot;disregards&quot; ofother income.(i)     Timetable3.     It is most important to me that the Ministry of Social SecurityBill should not be introduced before about the end of May.4.     The cost of the Bill on present form would be  26 million thisyear and   65 million in a full year.    This is not yet publicly known.For it to become known at or about the time of the Budget would be very embarrassing.    I could not then keep the expenditure out of the Budget,but I wish to avoid unnecessarily increasing the net total of Exchequerborrowing as shown in the Budget figures.5.     The present plan is to introduce the Bill next Monday and haveSecond Reading on 10th May - the worst possible timing from my pointof view - and the view is taken that only thus can1 Royal Assent beobtained before the end of July which it must be if the new benefits forwhich the Bill provides are to be introduced before the winter.    I do not feel able to accept this.C(66) 66COPY NO.27th April, 1966CABINET-1-CO [iVi PI BE MTIAL
(ii)   Statement on Cost6.     The cost of the new scheme cannot be found within the expenditurelimits laid down by the Cabinet for benefits and assistance to 1969-70.It was therefore agreed (C. C. (65) 7 0th Conclusions, Minute 2) that roomwould be found by limiting the next increase in existing benefits and thata statement about this limitation would be associated with the announce -ment of assistance changes.    The terms of such an announcement would need to be settled in time for the Second Reading of the Bill.(iii)   Level of Benefits and Disregards7.     Very briefly the issues here are whether the level of the newbenefit to replace   existing discretionary allowances should be 7s. 6d. or9s. and whether this benefit on the disregards of other income proposed should be adjusted to reduce the number of people who might get highertax free incomes because they were receiving non-contributory benefitsthan if they were earning income in the normal course8.      Points (ii) and (iii) are being discussed with the Minister ofPensions.    If the introduction of the Bill is postponed then I do not need to trouble my colleagues with either at least at this stage.    If not,however, it will be essential to settle (ii) at the end of next week and(iii) at Cabinet on Thursday next 28th April.    In case the latter becomesunavoidable I am arranging to circulate an Annex to this paper setting out the problem more fully.conclusion.     I ask my colleagues to endorse my view that on budgetary groundsintroduction of the Ministry of Social Security Bill should be postponed until about the end of May.L. J, C,Treasury Chambers, S. W, 1,27th April, 1966-2-
MINISTRY OF SOCIAL, SECURITY BILL,The Level of Benefit and of Disregards of Other income in her original proposals to the Social Services Committee andto the Cabinet (C.(65) 176) the Minister of Pensions proposed that peopleover pension age and other long-term cases apart from the unemployedshould receive a standard allowance of 7s. 6d. a week above the normalnational assistance scale rate in place of minor discretionary additions.The cost of this would be about  22 million a year.    This proposal was endorsed by the Cabinet (C.C.(65) 70th Conclusions, Minute 2).    TheMinister now proposes that the standard allowance shoiild be 9s. Od. aweek.     This extra Is. 6d. would cost some  4 million a year in theimmediate future rising to  7 million by 1969-70 and would continue to grow thereafter.    I do not consider this extra Is. 6d. is justified.2.       It is not in my view reasonable that the Cabinet should be askedto decide this issue at such short notice.    Were the introduction of theMinistry of Social Security Bill to be deferred this would not be necessarThis is a further strong reason for postponing the Billrs introduction,3.       There are several reasons why I think we should in any caseresist the increase of the standard allowance to 9s, Od.4.       First, the Minister has already used up all the resourcesallocated for benefits and assistance up to 1969-70 by the Cabinet.She is in fact &quot;overdrawn&quot; in the sense that the cost of the present Billcan only be met within the limits laid down by holding back the nextuprating of existing benefits below the level of the increase in earnings,(This was decided by the Cabinet - C, C.(65) 70th Conclusions, minute),    It is clearly important that this overdraft should be as limited aspossible.    In any case it is not prudent to use up all available resources at this early stage thus leaving increasingly limited room for manoeuvrebetween now and 1969-70,5,      Second, the Minister may argue that she is r. edifying herproposals in other respects in a way that reduces the overall cost andthat therefore the extra Is. 6d. on the standard allowance can be afforded.    I do not regard a reduction in cost made on merits in onefield as any reason for increasing costs in others.6.       Third, a standard allowance of 7s. 6d. when taken with theother improvements proposed would enable total increases of up to12s. 6d. a week to be given to some 900, 00.0 out of about 1,4 million old people.     The people who would not benefit with a 7s. 6d, allowance but who would benefit if it were 9s. Od, are limited in number and those whoare least in need.    Additional benefit of up to 12s, 6d. a week on top of12s. 6d. a week increase approved a year ago (the largest ever inabsolute and proportionate terms) would be substantial.    The more sosince the effect of the standard allowance if inevitably to give rather more to those who are less in need.-3--     160ANNEX
7.       There is a taxation aspect.    National Assistance payments arenot liable to tax but under the law as it stands the new non-contributory benefits would be unless specifically exempted.    The new benefits arehigher than those they replace and so in general are &quot;disregards&quot; ofother forms of income and capital.    If the 1/linister&apos;s proposals were accepted in full and the benefits exempted from tax there would be asubstantial increase in the number of people getting a total tax freeincome which would attract some tax if it consisted wholly of &quot;ordinary1income.    Holding the standard allowance at 7s. 6d. could help at the margin to contain this problem.Treasury, S. W. 1.27th April, 1966f\COM FIDE
