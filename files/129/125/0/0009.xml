THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)&quot;6TTC(66) 59 COPY NO.15th April, 1966CABINETSELECT COMMITTEESNote by the Lord President of the council I attach a copy of a paper on the wider use of Select committees which I have circulated to the Ministerial Committee on parliamentary procedure for consideration at a meeting on Monday, 18th April.    Thepaper proposes that as an experiment we should set up one or moreSelect Committees to inquire into particular matters, with power tosend for persons and papers and to make recommendations.I propose to report the Committee&apos;s views to the Cabinetorally at the meeting on Wednesday, 20th April.H.B.Privy Council Office, S. W. 1.15th April, 1966
SELECT COMMITTEESMeirorandjm^jyjbhe ^ford President of the council.    The Prime Minister has asked ne to consider whether there would beadvanta-ge in the new Parliament in conducting an experiment by whichSelect Committees, composed of backbenchers, would be set up to investigatematters within the purview of certain selected Departments - starting, forexample, with the Home Office or the Department of Education and Science,since both of these Departments deal with issues affecting family life and welfare and human rights which are all matters on which Members would feel able to contribute.     The Prime Minister envisages that the new select committees would work on the lines of the Estimates Committee or the nationalised Industry Committee, where on the whole a very constructive jobhas been done and divisions and arguments have rarely been on Party lines.2.     There is a strong case for a wider use of Select Committees.     It isdesirable to show that the G-overnment, so far from being arrogant in its relations with Parliament, wishes to give more work and authority to theHouse.     A measure designed to revive the influence of Parliament on the formulation of policy, though in substance a restoration of a position thathas been lost, vrould be welcomed at present as a step towards modernisingParliamentary institutions.     Select Committees could provide useful andeducative employment for the backbenchers and would encourage them to do a constructive job;   and in the long run the Committees would produce moreinformed debates on the floor of the House.3.     There are various forms of Select Conmittee that might be used:(a) a Select Committee to inquire into such matters relating to thework of a particular Department as might be referred to them bythe House;(b) a Select Committee to inquire into matters referred to them, butnot confined to a particular Department;(c) an ad hoc Select Committee set up to inquire into a singlespecified topic.Any of these could be given power to send for persons and papers.-1-
4.     In considering which   of these would be the most valuable, it is relevant to bear in mind the kind of work that can usefully be done and the amount of activity that we want to stimulate.    We do not want to stimulate a demandfor specialist committees on the American model operating in every field ofgovernment, including foreign affairs and defence;   nor should we want torefer to Select Committees matters which are subject to acute partycontroversy:   to do so would merely transfer to the Select Commibtee the controversy which would otherwise take place on the floor and would be likelyto impoverish the debates of the House without producing worthwhilerecommendations from the Committee.     We shall therefore need to maintaincontrol of matters referred to a Select Committee and, at least until we have some experience of the ability of Select Committees to do on other topics theconstructive job that has been done by the Committee on Nationalised Industries,we should avoid exposing ourselves to pressure to refer a large number oftopics.     It should be sufficient for our purposes to have one or at the mosttwo subjects under consideration at a time.     The number of Governmentbackbenchers who are not involved in Standing Committees (assuming fiveCommittees and the Scottish Grand Committee) is only about sixty, and not all of these will be anxious to find the time for Committee work.5.     We must also recognise the amount of work which an active Committee,particularly one specialising in the affairs of a single Department, couldthrow on the Ministers and officials who would be called upon for evidence and information;   the possibility of embarrassment resulting from permittedencroachment on the field of policy;   and the danger that, if the SelectCommittee were investigating a natter of current interest, this would prolongthe process of deciding policy, since the Government would have to avoid, sofar as possible, the charge that they had arbitrarily ignored the fact thatthe Select Committee was currently considering the matter.     The currentpressure on accommodation and the services of clerks and shorthand writers,none of which can be augmented rapidly, are also relevant.     Nevertheless,the advantages of the proposal appear to override these considerations.6.     It would clearly be right to start with an experiment, and my owninclination would be to experiment with a form of committee which left usplenty of room for manoeuvre.     I should prefer not to start with a committeespecialising in the work of a particular Department because this would bothrestrict our choice of subjects which could usefully be referred and concentrate the burden of work on the selected Department.     It might alsolead to unwelcome pressure for similar committees on foreign affairs and defence.     The choice seems to me to lie between(a)a Committee appointed to inquire into such natters as shall bereferred to them by the House;   andone or more Committees appointed to inquire into particularmatters.     We already contemplate a Joint Select Committee onTheatre Censorship;   we night select one other topic for a select Committee of the House of Commons.-2-
Of these alternatives, I slightly prefer the second, because the firstnight expose us to pressure to refer several topics at a tine and to empower the committee to work through sub-cornittees, or at least to keep up a steady supply of work for a committee working as a single unit.    ButI recognise that if we chose an ad hoc Gonrittee as the subject of theexperinerrb we should need to give an assurance that if the experiment were a success we should be prepared to make regular use of this procedure,7.     On natters of detail, I suggest -(i)   that the Select Comnitifcees should not be auuiorised to producedraft Bills as an end-product of their work.     It is extremelydifficult for a Select committee without the resources availableto a Departnent and without the assistance of parliamentary counsel to draft Bills whixh would be readily acceptable.     Onthe other hand, if the resources of Parliamentary Counsel wereto be nade available, this could have the effect of disruptingthe Governments legislative programme.     Further, the Govemnentnust be free to consider any report which is produced and on thebasis of its decisions to draft a Bill.     I suggest, -therefore,that the functions of the new Select Committees be United to producing reports naking recommendations for the considerationof the Government.(ii)   that Ministers should not be members of the new select committees,     It would be very difficult for a Minister tokeep control of a Select Committee as a Member, and oncethere was Government representation it vould be inpossibleto disdain some responsibility for the Report when it is produced^     There Is, however, a case fox- peraLtting the newSelect Committees to call Ministers (preferably junior ministers) to give evidence on natters of policy;   and i suggest that the Select Connittees should also be enpoweredto take evidence fron officials with specialised knowledge,e,g, the Head of. the Prison Departnent or sone specialisedofficial dealing with children^ adnini strati on.     It wouldalso be open to the Select committee to call for evidence fronoutside witnesses, such as members or staff of local authoritiesand recognised experts in the field under consideration.-3-
8k     We shall need to have in mind at the outset two or three topicswhich it would he appropriate to refer to a Select Committee.     Currentpossibilities that occur   to ne are reform of the lav/ on abortion,where vie have a considerable body of opinion in favour of amending the lav/but considerable disagreement on how far it is desirable, medically andsocially, to go;   the la?/ on gamingj   educational priorities;    and perhapssome aspect of road safety,     lily colleagues may have other suggestions *9.     If it is agreed in principle that we should experiment with the wider use of Select Committees, the Prime Minister will wish to say some-thing on the subject in the Debate on the Ad&amp;s?ese8   Since we may want togive further thought to details, this might be to the effect that theGovernment  are anxious that Members should be given greater opportunities to contribute to the formulation of policy, that the best way of acliievingthis  appears to be through the wider use of Select Committees;   that theGovernment propose to discuss with tine Opposition Parties an experimentwhich, if it proved successful, could be made the basis of a regularpractice for using the Select Committee procedure to investigate and make recommendations upon problems of current, interest and importance on vfeichParliament might subsequently be asked to consider legislation.10*   I should welcome the views of my colleagues on the proposal to initiate an experiment and the form it night take;   and on therecommendation which might be made to the Prime Minister on the terns ofa reference to the subject during the Debate on the Address,H.B.Privy Council Office,  Whitehall, S.W.1 .14th April, 1966-4-
