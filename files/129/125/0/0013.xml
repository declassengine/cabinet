1 CONFIDENTIAL -        145IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)F*l PiC(66) 63 COPY NO, ^25th April, 1966CABINETHOUSING PROGRAMME 1966Memprandum by the Minister of Housing andLocal GovernmentI have been considering the level of the public sector housing programme for the calendar year 1966 in the light of the disquietingperformance of the private sector in the first quarter of this year.2.     when  the Cabinet considered housing programmes in July last(CC(65) 39th Conclusions, Minute 1; and 43rd Conclusions, Minute, 3)the level of local authority approvals was set at 150,000 for each of theyears 1965 and 1966 with annual increases thereafter to a total of170,000 in 1970,    Subsequently the Cabinet agreed that the total pro-gramme for the two years 1965 and 1966 should be 300,000 so thatapprovals could be transferred from one year to another.(CC(65) 68th Conclusions, Minute 6).     In the event 152,000 approvalswere given in 1965.3.     The housing figures for the first quarter of this year, attached as Annex A, give grounds for concern.     February was a very bad month,partly because the rainfall was exceptionally heavy, and though Marchwas better, the performance in the first quarter as a whole was belowexpectations, particularly in the private sector.4,     Starts by public authorities are much as expected in the light ofthe pattern of new approvals last year.    Completions are slightly belowexpectations and I shall be taking measures to expedite thern,   but thereis not much that can be done in the short term without disrupting futureprogress.5,     The real difficulty is in the private sector where both starts andcompletions are down on our forecasts.    Earlier last year private housebuilding was held back by an acute shortage of mortgage funds.    It hadbeen expected that, once this had been overcome, private builders wouldrecover their confidence and both starts and completions would turnupwards.     This has not happened.6.     Despite a continued high level of building society advances and afull pipeline, the rate of completions by private builders has not increased as expected and construction times have lengthened.    It is becoming increa.singly clear that sales resistance is developing in new houses, although there continues to be a steady demand for existing houses.    Unless the rate at which private houses are completed picks upin the rest of the year, we shall fall short of 400, 000 new houses (public and private),-1-CO SSS FIDE NTS AL
7.     Starts of private houses for the first quarter follow the pattern ofrecent months and point to a total of about 210, 000 in the year.    this compares with the 250, 000 forecast last July when we provisionally fixedthe public sector programme for 1966, and 230,000 to 240,000 forecastlast autumn.8. These disappointing private housing figures do not seem to be dueto shortages of materials or labour.9.      It was always understood that I should reopen the 1966 public     \programme if the private sector fell short of expectations.    Now thatthis eventuality has arisen I seek approval for an extra 10, 000authorisations to be used during the balance of this year.    If approvedthey would be used to take up the slack in areas, mainly in the southand east, where private building is lagging.    This would help inparticular authorities who, with our present programme and priorities,would otherwise get no more than in 1964, despite their urgent need toprovide more housing to rent.10.     I would propose to allocate the extra authorisations broadly asfollows:-West Midlands 3,000South-West 500East Anglia )Eastern CountiesSouthern Counties 2, 000South-Eastern Counties      1^500000Total 10,000Hi     I shall get as many of the extra houses as possible built byindustrialised methods and authorities would be encouraged to employsystems for which capacity is available.    This should ensure shortconstruction times.12.     E, howevers. we are to influence the number of. houses completed before the end of this year, additional allocations must be givenimmediately to the authorities concerned so that they can be put out to tender within the next month or so.    Late though it is, I expect an appreciable number of the 10, 000 could be finished by quick industrialisedmethods before the end of December.13.     In due course I shall need to ask for an additional programme ofhouses to meet the National Coal Board,s requirements for minerstransferred to new pits as a result of the accelerated colliery closureprogramme.    The exact number and the timing of their provision has still to be decided by the Board but it is likely to be spread over three separate years.    In any case, these particular houses must be treatedquite separately from the ordinary local authority housing programme.R. H. S. C.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.
