ll3 DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)EUROPEAN LAUNCHER DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATIONAND EUROPE;  ELDO MINISTERIAL conference memorandum by the Minister of aviation in Decernber, 1965 the Cabinet decided (CC(65) 71st Conclusions,Minute 4) that we should terminate our commitment to ELDO, taking intoaccount the need to minimise the political damage of withdrawal.Subsequently our partners put forward a new proposal for the develop-rnent of an extended version of the ELDO A launcher (ELDO-PAS),which would launch commercial communications satellites much more cheaply than the ELDO B formerly planned.    Our partners also implied that they would be prepared to con mailer financial contribution by the United Kingdom.    Ministers therefore decided that the new developments justified a postponement of our withdrawal for a period of up to 3 months, during which the views and proposals of our partnerscould be studied in more detail.2.      At the Ministerial ELDO Conference on 20th-28th April (a reportof which is at Annex B of the Appendix to this paper) our Europeanpartners repeated their objections to the aide memoire we had sent inFeburary, 1966, prior to the ELDO conference, and urged upon us theneed to complete the ELDO A and continue co-operation in ELDO on future programmes.    The Conference, however, agreed that theproblems of ELDO needed closer study in the light of the proposals for extending the ELDO launcher into the ELDO-PAS system and decided to adjourn until 9th June to allow time for this study.3.      The attached report by the Official Committee on Technology sets out the results of the study by our officials of the new financial,scientific and technological features of the ELDO programmes andinvites Ministers to consider whether they wish to re-affirm the cabinet decision that we should terminate our commitment to ELDGor to reverse the decision and continue with ELDO subject to our percentagecontribution to the Organisation being reduced to 25 per cent from not later than 1st January, 1967. n4.      The report by officials suggests that the economic, scientific and technological appraisal of the ELDO programme is broadly the cameas when the Cabinet decided that we should end our commitment to ELDO,The political objections to withdrawal, however, are now very muchgreater than they were and there is now the strong probability that wecan reduce our financial eontribution to the Organisation.    In particular,I would also draw the attention af my colleagues to the following aopects:-C(66) 73COPY NO,24th May, 1966CABINET-1-
(i)  Technological and Economic Considerations(a) The new proposals for ELDO-PAS are technically feasibleand provide a significant improvement on the original ELDO a programme v/hich was before the Cabinet when the December decision was taken.    The cost of ELDO launchers are admittedly likely to be2-3 times greater than using an equivalent United States launcher but,as mentioned in the official report, there can be no certainty that the americans will be prepared to make available launchers for commercial purposes.(b) There is growing interest in the use of satellites for television purposes.(c) Our EIDO partners have indicated that they are disposed to use their majority powers in ESRQ to insist that E3RO uses ELDOlaunchers.(d) We shall be subjected to great pressures at home to expandnational space expenditure if we leave EIDO.    This could&apos; be more expensive as well as less satisfactory.    While the amount of technological &quot;fall-out&quot; from space research and development is veryarguable, to opt out of the field entirely now while our European allies are continuing, would have an unfavourable effect on our attempts to ,strengthen and modernise our technology.(ii) Financial Implications(a) Whereas at the time of the Cabinet decision the total costof continuing with the initial ELDO programme lay between 4-8 and  58 million, the present estimate for continuing with the eldo A programme and for up-grading it to include the ELDO-PAGprogramme is, on the assumption that our contribution can be reducedto 25 per cent from 1st January, 1967,   42 million.(b) If we withdraw from ELDO and, as now seems likely, our partners continue without us, we shall have to pay to ELDO  14. 5 million as the balance of our commitment.(c) Provided our partners agree to our contribution being reduced to 25 per cent from 1 st January, 1967 for the ELDO A andEDLO-PAS programme, the additional cost (over and above the 14. 5 million referred to in (b) above) would be about  27 million -about  5-f- million for the first three years of the programme and about 32 million for the last three.    Most of the foreign exchange costs wouldbe covered by contracts placed in this country.(iii) Political Aspects(a) It was made clear to me by the European Ministers at theEDLO Conference that British withdrawal would have a serious effecton our standing in Europe and our approach towards closer Europeanassociation.    Dutch, Belgian and Italian Ministers stressed this asmuch as the French and German:  it would in my view be extremelydamaging for us to withdraw at a time when our European partners haveintimated their willingness to help us to reduce our financial burden.-2-
(b) It is likely that, if we do withdraw from ELDO, our european partners v/ill go ahead without us. We shall then be effectively excluded from any collaboration in European space technology.(c) Withdrawal from ELDO could well prejudice our efforts in seeking closer collaboration with Europe in new scientific and technological fields.    We can expect a particularly sharp reaction fromthe French and I am very concerned at the effect this may have on anglo/French collaboration on v/hich our industrial and military aircraft programme is now based.(d) The United States Government have made it clear that theyare most anxious for us to stay in ELDO and have offered technicalhelp for ELDO-PAS.    &quot;Withdrawal may forfeit American goodwill onwhich we are greatly dependent in other fields.conclusion,      I made it clear to our partners at the Conference in April thatthe United Kingdom could not under any circumstances contemplatecommitment to the ELDO B programme and I shall re-emphasise this at the resumed Conference on the 9th June.    I believe, however, it isimportant to keep the option open to the United Kingdom to take advantageof technological developments over the next few years and that continuedparticipation in ELDO is the cheapest means of doing this.    I considertherefore that the balance of advantage lies, provided our contribution is reduced to 25/30 per cent not later than 1st January, 1967, in our continuing to participate in the ELDO A programme and to agree to itsmodification to include ELDO-PAS.6.      I ask my colleagues for authority to proceed on this basis at theConference in Paris on 9th June.POSTSCRIPT7.      Since the above paper was prepared, the Chief Secretary,Treasury and I saw the Secretary General of ELDO at his request.    Thelatest revised estimates of the ELDO Secretariat for the cost of theELDOA-PAS programme are substantially below those in the officials1report as they make less allowance for contingencies and firings.Nevertheless it is prudent to base our calculations on the agreed figures in the officials&apos; report,8.       The Secretary General indicated that there would be greatdifficulty in getting the agreement of other member Countries to theUnited Kingdom contribution being reduced to about 25 per cent for theoriginal ELDO A programme and considered that our 38. 8 per cent couldnot be lowered below 33 per cent for this part of the programme.    Thiswould have the effect of reducing our total contribution over the period1967-1971 to 29.75 per cent.F.M.Ministry of Aviation, S.W.I.23rd May, 1966-3-
EUROPEAN LAUNCHER DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATION (ELDO)Note by the Chairman of theOfficial Committee on technology.     Following the Prime Minister&apos;s instructions that Departments shouldreconsider the new financial, scientific and technological features ofthe ELDO programmes, the Communications-Electronics and Space Committee(CSC) prepared the attached report, which after amendment has now been endorsed by the Official Committee on Technology (t(0)).iThe figures in the report are based on the best estimates that oanbe provided, and have been agreed interdepartmentally.     They show that anELDO launch will be two to three times as costly as a comparable Americanlaunch.     On the other hand, as paragraph 7 and Annex C point out, we havebeen unable to obtain any assurance that the United States would be willing to provide launching facilities for communications or othersatellites if these implied potential commercial competition with Americanundertakings or with international undertakings in which the United states was an active partner.     This makes the position decidedly confusing inview of the repeated indications over the past four weeks of Americanconcern that ELDO should remain in being with the United Kingdom an activepartner.     The United States take this latter position because(i) they fear that the break-up of ELDO would lead to the growth ofnational space programmes in Europe (with possible military overtones),and (ii) they see the development of launcher technology as a means whereby the technological gap between America and a united Europe canbe reduced.     They are convinced that launcher development is a bridgeleading to more advanced, technologies in a variety of fields.3-     The report does not explore the extent to v/hich a, decision on ELDOwill affect the development programme of the European Conference onSatellite Communications (CETo).     This is because of the doubleuncertainties in that programia-a itself.     The members of GETS have notyet decided whether or not the -pr0gramme should be carriftcl out by-1-COWFIDENTIALAPPENDIX
Governments or whether they should, rely primarily upon development through\commercial consortia.     It is only if eventually GETS decides in favourof a governmental programme that E1D0 is relevant, but in that event,and should the United States then be unwilling to sell launchers for thedevelopment of commercially competitive satellites, the CETS programmed could not be carried out if ELDO were abandoned.     The United Kingdom&apos;proposed BLACK ARR07 launcher could be used only for testing components and sub-assemblies, and would not be capable of launching a completeexperimental communications satellite.(Signed)   S. ZUCKERKANCabinet Office, S.&apos;\\120th May, 1966.-2-
-1-introduction in December, 19^53 the Cabinet decided (CC(65) 7&quot;! st Conclusions,Minute 4) that we should terminate our commitment to the Organisation,taking into account the need to minimise the political damage of withdrawal.In February, 1966, prior to the ELDO Ministerial Conference, we sent our partners an aide memoire, setting out our doubts about the technologicaland economic value of the programmes and our concern about the steeplyrising costs.   This had a hostile reception.   While sharing some of ouranxiety about costs, our partners strongly contested our low estimate ofthe technological value of the programmes and stressed the need for continued co-operation in the development of a heavy launching capabilityfor Europe, independent of the united States or Russia.   A new proposal wasalso put forward for the development of an extended version of the ELDO-Alauncher (ELDO-PAS), which would launch commercial communications satellitesmuch more cheaply than the ELDO-B previously planned.    Our partners also^implied that they would be prepared to consider a smaller financial contri-bution by the United Kingdom.   Ministers therefore decided(MISC 110(66) 1st Meeting) that the new developments justified a postpone-ment of our withdrawal for a period of up to three months, during whichthe views and proposals of our partners could be studied in more detail.The Ministerial ELDO Conference on the 26th-28th April (a report on whichis attached as Annex B), agreed to adjourn for this purpose until 9th JunerOfficials were instructed by the Prime Minister to consider the financial,technological and scientific aspects of the new proposals.   These are considered in Annex A attached;    the factors which have changed since theCabinet decision are summarised in the following paragraphs.Technological and Economic2.     ELDO-PAS is technologically feasible but there is in the programmeslittle additional work of technological interest to the United Kingdom;   nor,despite its ability to place commercial communications satellites in geo-stationary orbit from an equatorial launching site, does it significantlyalter the economic prospects of ELDO in respect of satellite communications,except in so far as it may meet French or other national aspirations outsidethe global system.   Thus there has been no change in our broad economicassessment of the ELDO programmes.    In some quarters in the United Kingdomthere, has, however, been some change of attitude to space technology in european IAUNCHER DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATION (ELDO)Report by the Official Committee on Technology;
recent months.   This may be no more than a shift of feeling and isunquantifiable.   There is a growing interest in the possibility of directbroadcasting from satellites and some anxiety about the unforeseeabletechnological consequences of abandoning work on heavy launchers.Financial3.     At the time of the Cabinet decision the total cost to the UnitedKingdom-of the ELDO programmes, based on a 38.8 per cent contribution tothe initial programme and 25 per cent contribution to subsequent programmes and spread over the five years 1966/67 - 1970/71, lay between  48 and 58 million.    It is now estimated that if the Initial Programme were carried through to completion, including the ELD0-PA3 perigee/apogeesystem, the total cost to the United Kingdom over the six-year period1966/67 - 1971/72, based on a 25 per cent contribution from 1st January, 1967(to which our partners have yet to agree) would be about  42 million,including a 50 per cent contingency on the estimate for the perigee/apogeesystem.   On the other hand, were we to terminate our commitment and wereELDO to be continued by the other Member States (as might well be the case,contrary to our expectation last December), the cost of withdrawal would bethe balance of our financial commitment, i.e.  14*5 million.   Thus the net cost of continuing would be about  27 million, with an average of some 5.5 million a year for the first three years and some  3.5 million a year over the last three, the gross cost of either contributions or of terminalexpenses being substantially larger in the earlier period.   A large part ofthe cost in foreign exchange of this total sum would be met through contractsfrom ELDO placed in this country.   Should our withdrawal from ELDO lead tothe immediate dissolution of the Organisation, our share of the cost ofwinding it up would be  4 million.   If the choice lay between completecollapse.and full continuation, the net cost of continuing, taking intoaccount payment for work already done (&apos; 2 million), our contribution until30th June, 1966 ( 3 million) and the winding up costs as above, would be some  33 million.4.     It can be argued that it is unlikely that the cost of completingELLO-PAS will be the total commitment, in that there will be continuingpressure to maintain ELDO and develop more powerful launchers.   although this may be so, the political difficulty to the United Kingdom of with-drawing when ELDO has reached and overtaken the target set in the originalagreement would be likely to be less than now, bearing in mind that theUnited Kingdom had a particular responsibility for the initiation of thecurrent programme.   On the other hand there may be a greater pressure
from industry both here and in Europe to continue.   Nevertheless, if theUnited Kingdom now made its intentions unmistakably clear, it would befreer to decide the advantage of continuing, or otherwise, on economicand technological merits when the time comes.   But even if the mainarguments for continuing in ELDO are political, the reasons which convinceour European partners that the programme is worthwhile apply equally to a programme of satellite development.   There will therefore be the samepolitical pressure for us to embark on such a programme, for example,that of CETS which could cost the United Kingdom at least  2 million ayear over the next five or six years, with possibly heavy liabilitiesthereafter.5.     The best estimate that can so far be made of the cost to a customerof launching with the ELDO-PAS is that it may be 2-3 times greater thanthat of using an equivalent United States launcher.    This means thatthere is no prospect of selling launchers for the international satelliteoommunications system unless they are substantially subsidised.    On theother hand, from the European point of view one cannot be certain that,except for scientific purposes, launchers would be available from elsewhere.Political6.     There have been the following important political developments sincethe Cabinet decision.7.     The United States Government have made it clear in unsolicitedadvances to ourselves and our partners that they wish ELDO to continue and Britain to remain in it (see Annex C);    and have offered technical help for ELDO-PAS.   They have said they regard the gap between Europe and them-selves in advanced technology as a weakness for the West and consider thedevelopment of space (including launcher) technology in Europe is essentialto overcome it.   They have indicated that they fear our withdrawal would increase the possibility of augmenting the French and German nationalprogrammes to include military launcher capabilities.   By abandoningELDO the United Kingdom might forfeit American goodwill, on v/hich we greatlydepend in other fields.   On the other hand, neither the American state department nor NASA have given a clear answer as to whether Europe couldrely on the United States for launching satellites for other thanscientific purposes.
8.     The French withdrawal from NATO provides an opportunity, which we aretaking in various ways, to give a more positive lead in Europe.   This iswelcomed by the rest of the Six and is greatly in our interests.     Ourabandonment of ELDO at this juncture would not only run directly counter to our main line of policy in this respect and prejudice our efforts toforge closer links with European countries, but would leave them even moreexposed to unwelcome French influence.9.     Far from welcoming our initiative, or accepting our arguments, our ELDOpartners (like the Americans, see paragraph 7 above) have shown basicdisagreement from our assessment of the importance of launcher technology.If ELDO were to disappear through our defection, and our partners were inconsequence to be denied the possible political, technological and commercial fruits of independent satellite development, they would resentthis particularly strongly.     In fact they seem likely to carry on theactivities of the organisation in some form if we abandon it.   they recognise our economic and financial burdens and are willing to go a longway to easing then:   but a refusal by us to respond to this willingness will cause widespread resentment. ,Conclusion10.   The question for decision by Ministers is whether in the light of:(a) a broadly unchanged economic, scientific, and technologicalappraisal (subject to paragraph 2);(b) the probability that we can reduce the financial cost( para.graphs 3-5);(c) the increased political objections to withdrawal(paragraphs 7-9);they wish to reaffirm the decision that we should (effectively) withdraw from ELDO or to reverse the decision, and oontinue with ELDO, subject tothe condition that our percentage contribution to the Organisation is reduced to 25.0 per cent from not later than 1st January, 19&amp;7.

I      FINANCE(a) Cost of the ELDO ProgrammesELDO AThe latest available estimate of the cost of ELDCs initial programme(ELDO-A), based on figures provided &quot;by Member States when preparing the1966 budget, is about  158 million.     Of this about  80 million has already-been spent and a total of  120 million authorised to cover commitments tothe end of 1966.ELDO BThe original Secretariat estimate of the cost of the ELDO B programmebefore detailed studies had been made was  130 million without anycontingency.     On the basis of partially completed project studies, theyhave now revised the estimate to  261 million.     The Ministry of Aviationsuggest the   addition of a 2..0 per cent contingency, which would take thetotal estimated cost to  365 million.(b) Cast of Withdrawal from ELDOWhen Ministers decided that we should terminate our commitment toELDO it was expected that without our support ELDO would collapse.Discussion during the Ministerial Conference suggested that our partnersmight well be prepared to carry on without our support.     The terminalcosts, if ELDO were wound up at this stage, are estimated tentativelyat some  10-12 million.     These figures do not include outstandingpayments to contractors for work already carried out at the time of cancellation.     If Member States agreed that the costs of winding upELDO should be split on the normal scale of contributions our sharewould be  3.9- [-.5 million.     If we withdrew, and our partners   con-tinued in ELDO, we should have to bear our share of the  120 millionalready authorised.     Our contributions in respect of the period upto 31st March, -\J&amp;6 amounted to  32 million, and our share of the 120 million at 38=79 per cent is  ^6.5 million.     Thus  1^.5 million would remain to be paid to ELDO as the balance of our commitment.&apos;
(o)   Cost of ELDO PAS Development programme the alternative to the termination of our commitment is for us toparticipate in the proposed ELDO PAS programme (ELDO A with the additionof the perigee/apogee system) with - if our partners agree - a reducedcontribution of 25 per cent.The ELDO Secretariat has not yet prepared a detailed estimate of thecost of developing and proving the recently proposed perigee/apogee system.On the basis of completed project studies for the apogee stage and ofinformation from the French on the cost of the perigee motor system, the secretariat estimate the cost of the ELDO perigee/apogee system would be: m1. ;..&apos; Inertial Guidance 1.12. &apos;!

Manufacture and launching of three ELDO-Asto prove this system 16.0 jTotal without contingency 40.6After discussion with the Secretariat the Ministry of Aviation accept this estimate except for item 5, where it is thought that the developmentcontent is greater than the Secretariat have in mind.     They therefore propose that a further  4.3 million should be added, giving a total withoutcontingency of  44*9 million.     The Secretariat are confident that a contingency of 25 per cent on their total of  40.6 million is sufficient,giving a total with contingency of  50 million.     The Ministry of Aviationwould prefer a 50 per cent contingency, which, added to their increasedtotal, would give a total cost of  67.5 million.     On the information atpresent available this should be sufficient to develop the system including an optimised motor.On the Ministry of Aviation estimate and assuming a reduction In our contribution from 1st January, 1967, our contribution for the financial years from 1966-7 to 1971-2 when the perigee/apogee development is expected to becompleted is estimated to be  41.6 million.     If it proved possible to reduce our contribution from a date earlier than 1st January, 1967; this figure wouldbe reduced by up to  3.18 million.     v7e should not in any event contemplatepaying more than a   share of the cost of the additional perigee/apogeeprogramme based on our GNP (about 25 per cent).     In ESR0 the Conventionprovides that no Member State should pay more than 25 per cent and there is thus a good precedent for insisting on that ceiling for future ELDO programmes

Prom soundings he had taken,they seemed prepared to accept as the price for continued British participa-tion some change in the cost sharing arrangements, not only to futureprogrammes but also to the part that was left of the initial programme.He doubted if any change could be implemented before 1st January, 1967..   Anything he did would be completely without commitment, either to the UnitedKingdom or to other ELDO governments.     His purpose would be simply to find out if the basis for an agreement existed.     He would thereafter come toLondon and discuss the result with Ministers,The Secretary-General has since said that he will make these soundingson his own account.     17e have told him that, if he wishes to make his conclusions known to us he would be welcome and that Ministers will receive him.     He has suggested that he comes to London on 23rd May, 1966.-4-COMFSDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALII     PERFORMANCE AND PUNCHING- COSTS OP ELDO PAS(a)   Perf oriaanceUsing an existing French solid rocket as its perigee motor ELDO PASshould &quot;be able to put a satellite of at least 150 legs into a geostationeryorbit from an equatorial site, assuming that ELDO-A does not fall signi-fioantly short of its present forecast performance.    YJith an improvedversion of the perigee motor it should put into orbit in 1970/71 acommunications satellite of 200 kgs;   that is, about four times the size of Early Bird, which is now operating with a capacity of 250 telephonechannels, and considerably bigger than INTELSAT III (109 kgs), which isintended to be used to estahlish the interim glohal telecommunicationssystem in 1968 and have a capacity of at least 1200 telephone channels.(h)   Launching CostsNo reliable estimate is available.     The ELDO Secretariat have estimated the cost of an ELDO-A launching as  3.6 million, on theassumption that a production programme would run concurrently with a development programme which weuld absorb some of the overhead costs.As we have said that we could not support the proposed ELDO-B programme,it must now be assumed that there would in fact he no parallel develop-ment programme.     Assuming that all overheads would be carried by theproduction programme alone, and that a requirement for two launchings ayear is the most that could be expected, the Ministry of Aviation estimate the cost of an ELDO PAS launching for a customer, assuming that no elementis included in the charge for amortisation of capital costs, as 5-3 million.     This may be compared with the  3.2 million which it isthought NASA may charge ESRO for a launch using Atlas Agena.     This figure is believed to be on much the same basis as the ELDO estimate and toinclude no element for NASA, overheads or depreciation of range equipment.Both figures may be compared with the estimates which NASA has given toICSC for launching satellites of ahout 109 kgs for the global communi-cations system;    a multiple launching of three satellites by Atlas Agenais said to cost  2.7 million, a launching by Thor Delta of a singlesatellite the size of INTELSAT III  1.25 million.     All these figures include launching site costs, but it is not known to what extent the NASAquotation to ICSC for a multiple launching includes the costs ofadapting the launching pad.     It may be however that NASA is prepared to quote lower costs to the ICSC than to European customers.-5-
-6-CO SM FS DE INITIALIII   POSSIBLE EBMfiND FOR ELDO PAS(a)  . Sjaientif ioELDO PAS itself is of no interest to United Kingdom scientists concernedwith fundamental research in space, &quot;but ESRO may use two launchers for itslarge astronomical satellite, provided that it meets ESR0&apos;s requirements forperformance and delivery, and costs no more than a suitable American launcher.On the basis of the costs quoted in Section II(b) above this means in effectthat ELDO would probably have to offer its launcher at a highly subsidisedprice.     There is no prospect that any British scientific satellite willrequire a launcher as large as ELDO PAS.03)   Tele communicationsWe should maintain our present policy that the development of asatellite system should be on a broad international basis with the objective of the creation of a world system for satellite communications.     So far aswe are concerned there can be no question of supporting the development of aseparate system.     Our European partners in CETS and the commonwealth communities authorities are also at the present time committed to asingle international system.The world system now seems certain to iake the initial form of anumber (perhaps five, possibly growing to seven in 1975) geo-stationarysatellites of 109 kgs.,   which are likely to be available to provide worldcoverage during 1968, i.e. before ELDO PAS is operational.     Thereafter wecan expect replacement satelli-tec, taking account of both obsolescence andthe probable durability of satellites, at a rate which is nost unlikely to exceed two per year.     If ELDO PAS proves fully competitive with Americanlaunchers, both as to price and performance, there is no reason why thelauncher should not be used for, at any rate, some proportion of these further launchingsj   the European members of the IGSC should be able to exert considerable influence to this end.     But the present estimates of launching costs quoted in Section II(b) above suggest that ELDO is unlikely to get down to the American price unless heavily subsidised by Member States.The ICSC is studying possible needs for satellite facilities, in the period from 1972 on, involving satellites of 1,000 kgs.,   much heavier than those to be used for establishing the basic world system.     These later satelliteswould be beyond the capabilities of ELDO PAS,
Aside from the possibility of the actual use of ELDO-PASin the maintenance of the world satellite communications system,it has been argued that the strength of the European bargaining position,   when the Interim International Agreements are re-negotiated in 1969/70, would be weakened if Europe lackedany effective launohing capacity or any prospects of achieving it.This view is firmly held in Eurepe and is one of the reasans whyour partners wish to continue the ELDO programme.     Without such a capacity, the European oountries feel they would be in the positionof having to negotiate empty-handed and with no fall-back position.They would argue that they could use European launching capacity as an effective bargaining counter without endangering theprinciple of a single global system.     We for our part could not join in using such a counter if it were likely to call this principle in question.     The European argument cannot be totallydismissed, but such strengthening of Europe&apos;s position as would come fram the possession of an effective launching capacity wouldnot in our view be worth lay itself the tost of the developmentof the capacity.-7-
-8-CONFIDENTBAL(c) European Conference on Satellite Communications - (CETS)The Technical Planning Staff of CETS have put forward a programme forthe development of an experimental communications atellite which wouldinvolve the use of either ELDO or American launchers.    This programme isbeing re-examined by CETS in the light of the new proposals for the ELDO PASlauncher and in any event no firm view has yet been adopted in the UnitedKingdom on whether or not we should join in a CETS programme of this nature.The plan put forward envisaged the use of three ELDO or two Americanlaunchers.     In the light of the probable increased cost of an ELDO launching,considerable economies could perhaps be made if the last two of the threeproposed launchings to prove the PAS vehicle could be used for trie CETSdevelopment programme,     If both the ELDO and CETS programmes were adopted,this might give a saving of about  5 million on their total cost.     the eldo PAS programme would probably be pursued to hest advantage if it wereintegrated with the proposed CETS programme.     This would however presentcomplications because some countries are wedded   to the idea that ESB.0should be responsible for developing an experimental communications satellitefor CETS, whereas if the ELDO and CETS programmes were integrated, it mightbe better if ELDO wero oharged with overall responsibility for the work,(d) Mrecjt Teleyision and Sound J^oadoas^DgMuch interest has developed recently in the possibility that geo-stationary satellites could be used as sound or television broadcasting stations.     (The   relaying of sound or television transmissions by satelliteis a normal function of a telecommunications system, for which facilitieswill be provided within the global satellite communications system,)     Fromthe technical viewpoint, two possibilities can be distinguished:-(i) that satellites might be developed having sufficient power to broadcast directly into home receiving equipment - either ofthe present type or of some newly developed typej(ii)   that less powerful satellites could broadcast signals suitablefor reception by a more sophisticated &quot;community&quot; receivinginstallation, the signals then being distributed locally -e.g. by a wired relay system.The technical problems have not yet received sufficient study forthese two possibilities to be appraised in relation to the use of ELDOIt seems likely, however, that satellites as in (i) above would require amuch more powerful launching vehicle.     Satellites as in (ii) might perhaps be within the ELDO PAS capability.     It must be emphasised that this is avery crude assessment v/hich cannot be refined until a good deal more isknown about the characteristics of the satellites v/hich v/ould be required tomeet any of these broadcasting purposes.     The satellites themselves would undoubtedly cost a good deal to develop.
However, there are nany problens which transcend those relating tothe design of satellites.     The use of frequency channels for &quot;broad-casting fron satellites would be nore wasieful of frequency space than their use by existing broadcasting stations, &quot;because each frequency channelcould only be used once within an area some thousands of niles across ifinterference were to he avoided.     This would inevitably reduce the totalnuriber of different programmes that could be made available.in a congestedarea such as Europe.     She design and production of a cheap domesticreceiver and the provision of sufficient power in the satellite are alsoserious obstables, more particularly in relation to category (i) above.Broadcasting fron a satellite of the kind referred to in (i) above would of course make it possible for any one country with access to it to transmitstraight into people!s homes in any other country within its service rangeprovided they were equipped to receive itj   and, unless there were inter-national regulations to the contrary and unless they were observed, thesetransmissions could include advertisements, political propaganda and other material of a kind which is either strictly controlled or forbidden in   1the domestic broadcasting services of the receiving country.Exact prediction is impossible but the tine required for the developmentof really powerful television satellites is unlikely to be significantlyless than ten years.     However, progress in space technology has beenrapid and much would depend on the effort put into the problem.    Moreover,this is a field in which nation states are politically highly sensitiveand European governments will for the most part probably be unwilling tobe dependent on the use of American launchers for any television satellitesthat nay bo developed.3-
a;:.:h;;;;.i:^y&apos;.v:;-,....(e) MilitaryIt would be possible, given an equatorial launching site and adequatelaunching capacity, for an ELDO PAS to put a military communicationssatellite into geo-stationary orbit.     The advantages of using a militarysatellite communications system are being studied in relation to our future requirements and the costs.     Y/e are in fact already participatingwith the United States in an experimental military satellite communicationssystem and are discussing the use of operational capacity.     There are atpresent certain possible difficulties about the control of a system sharedwith the Americans, but there would be considerable advantages in tine-scale, in cost in interoperability with the United States world-wide system and above all in reliability.     Moreover, Article 9 of the ELDO Conventionentitles Members who have participated in one of its programmes to procurefor any peaceful purposes launchers and equipment developed under that programme.     The Convention does not, however, define &quot;peaceful purposes&quot;.If the United Kingdom wished to purchase an ELDO vehicle to launch amilitary communications satellite, it would be   for the ELDO Council todecide whether such a sale was in accordance with the Convention, and theywould have formally to be asked to do so.     On the basis of earlier discussions they could be expected to agree.     The United StatesGovernment would also have to be consulted about such a sale because,when making BLUE STREAK information available to ELDO, they stipulated that their prior agreement should be obtained to its use for military purposes.(f) Navigational and Meteorological SatellotesThe possibility of providing navigational aids for either ships or aircraft by means of satellites has been successfully demonstrated. Itis probable that a world system (which would be far more economical than any possible national system) would only involve about six satellitesand since their masses do not exceed a few hundred pounds and only a loworbit is required, the ELDO-A vehicle would probably suffice.     Such asatellite could certainly be put into orbit by the ELDO PAS vehicle0The United States TOS system, to be established in 1966, willprovide continuous daily worldwide weather observations by satellite.Thirty member nations of the World Meteorological Organisation areequipping themselves with relatively simple automatic picture transmission .equipment for receipt of observations.     A direct communication link hasbeen established between World Weather Centres in Washington and Moscowfor exchange of data.     Very few satellites are needed for this service.The ELDO-A vehicle could probably suffice for this purpose also.-10-COWFIDEMTIAL
-11-?f*i ij 3IV    EQUATORIAL LAUNCHING- SITEELDO will require an equatorial launching site in order to put intoorbit a satellite with a substantial payload. The three locations nowproposed for this are French Guiana, Northern Australia and a mobile sea-going platform of the San Marco type, developed by the Italians.Political considerations apart, French Guiana seems the mostsuitable. The facilities proposed appear to be technically adequate and the living accommodation seems to be on a much better scale than in either ofthe others;   after allowing for a considerable subsidy, which the French are understood to have offered, the cost to ELDO is estimated by the ELDOSecretariat to be . 8.2 million.     The Australian proposal is for a siteabout 20 miles east of Darwin.     Their estimate of the cost is only 6.4 million,, but the ELDO Secretariat think the facilities offered are notadequate and increase this figure to  10.3 million.     Both the ELDOSecretariat and the Ministry of Aviation doubt the suitability of San Marcotype platforms for vehicles as heavy as ELDO-A.     The ELDO Secretariatestimate its cost as  19.6 million, as compared with an Italian estimate of 14.3 million.     The main advantage of the San Marco proposal is that, If itworked, It would give a site not on the territory of any country and thustruly international.The choice of an equatorial site has serious political and financial implications for ELDO.     The French attach great importance to ELDO choosingto make use of the base they are building in French Guiana for their national programme.     It will be used fcr civil purposes only.     The Frenchappear to make their offer to purchase two ELDO launchers dependent on the choice of this base.     On the other hand the Australians are making a determined effort to get the Darwin site selected.     Any possibility of getting an Australian contribution to the cost of future programmes(including the apogee/perigee proposal) is almost certainly dependent onDarwin being chosen.     &quot;While for political reasons we would prefer to seeDarwin selected, we have so far held that the choice must depend on technical and financial considerations.
CON Fi Dc N Ti At.V      STRUCTURE OP ELDOThis is a matter of concern only if ELDO continues and we remain amember of it.     All Member States are concerned about the efficiency ofthe Organisation and the ability of the Secretariat to control andco-ordinate the work in Member Countries.     The ELDO Council has approvedarrangements for strengthening the Secretariat and re-organising its technical side to reinforce management of the project.     At the same timethe French have proposed that, in view of the increased power of the secretariat, Member States should have a closer control of its activitiesthrough the establishment of a permanent control commission, consisting ofone representative from each Member State.     Other countries would findmore acceptable the establishment of a panel of inspectors to be nominated by Member States.     These inspectors would carry out specific invostiga-tions, at the request of the Council in every instance.     It would be opento Member States to propose to the Council that any project should be investigated by an appropriate panel.The principal firms - Hawker Siddeley Dynamics and Rolls-Royce in theUnited Kingdom, SEREB in France and ASAT in Germany - have been unhappyfor some time about the arrangements for planning and controlling the ELDOprogramme.     They have jointly put forward a proposal that an industrialgroup should be set up and charged with day-to-day running of the pro-gramme and with responsibility for its co-ordination.     If ELDO programmesgo ahead any proposals to improve management are liktly to commandsupport.     It will be for the Council to consider whether the strengthening of the Secretariat, the proposed panel of inspectors and any contractualarrangements for industrial co-ordination of the programme would makeimprovements in the management of the Organisation commensurate with theincreased cost.
(1)confidential annex BEUROPEAN LAUNCHER DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATION (ELDO)Report on the^ Jkgifjgrenoe^of Mirri\sters26T -28th AERIL7 19&apos;go&quot;        &quot;Goneral1,     The Conference, tihich was held in the Western European UnionBuilding in Paris, was convened in order that Ministers could jointlyreview the need for an autonomous launching capability in Europe, progress with the initial programme, problems associated with future programmes and the desirability of a general co-ordination of European spaoe policy.In the event, the course of the meeting diverged considerably from thatlaid down in the formal Agenda, adopted in the opening stages of theConference,Pjyqoedings2,     After an opening speech on behalf of the French Government, In Vihichhe gave an expose of the history and significance of ELDO,j^Alain Peyjrefitte, the French Minister for Scientific Research, was unanimously elected Chairman of the Confarenoe, j^e^s ^aeBelgian Minister for Foreign Affairs, was elected Vice-Chairaan,3*     Introducing Item 4 of the Agenda (General debate on an autonomouslaunching capability in Europe), the Chairman said that the organisation had reached a crisis and attributed the difficulties to shortcomings inthe structure of the Secretariat, to the new potential technicalcapabilities of the ELDO programme and to the question of an equatoriallaunching site,,     After a formal report on the past and possible futureof the Organisation by Professor Bock (President of the ELDO Council),tlle l^ijai^terjif^Aviation, as leader of the United Kingdom delegation,made a statement in whieh he rehearsed the arguments vhich had been setout in our aide menoire of -the 16th February, 1966 and questioned thetechnical, financial and economic foundations of the ELLO-A and elect-Bprogrammes.     He hoped during the Conferenoe to hear- the viewsof theother member Governments on the desirability of continuing with thedevelopment of a heavy launcher, and concluded by saying that &quot;these views will be examined by the United Kingdom very carefully before we decide whether or not we should continue to support the present programmeor embark on other programmes&quot;.
O (&quot; f%4.     The speeches that followed wore by way of replies to the statement by the Minister of Aviation.     All were in support of ELDO, and thearguments put forward in the written comments on our aide memoire wererepeated.     The German delegate emphasised that if ELDO were allowed tocollapse, Europe would lose for all tine the possibility of constructing a european heavy launcher.     He favoured a better co-ordination of Europeanspaoe activities.     The,jjethejrlands jdelegate said that national launcherprogrammes were too expensive.     Although the Netherlands had contributed to ELDO more in money than it had received in work, his Governmentfavoured a reconsideration of the distribution of contributions.     Theabandonment of ELDO might endanger the future of European co-operation inother fields;   but decisions on ELDC-A/S and ELDO-B oould not be taken until more detailed studies had been done.     It was the belief and experienceof the Netherlands that the work so far done on ELDO-A was of great technical and industrial value.     The. Belgian delegate said that it would beregrettable if the United Kingdom were to withdraw from ELDO now, at a -feLmewhen moves were afoot to involve her more closely in European affairs.Belgium shared some of the British concern about the costs of ELDO andfelt the need for an agreed European policy on space.     Small countrieslike Belgium could only participate in space activities on a collaborativebasis and they had to have confidence in the continuity of the co-operativeprogrammes.     The ELDO venture would ultimately become profitable throughthe opening up of large markets in the electronic field, especially whendirect TV transmission from satellites became practicable.     If the ELDOprogrammes were abandoned, satellite telecommunications would be left inthe hands of the United States.5*     The Australian delegate outlined Australia&apos;s effective contributionto ELDO through the provision of the launching facilities at Woomera and emphasised his Governmenfs continuing support of the Organisation.     TheAustralian Government ,were willing to confirm their offer of January, 1965   ,to provide launching sites for all future programmes, including in, particular an equatorial site on Australian territory for whioh they hadalready submitted proposals.     However, they recognised that further study would be required before an equatorial base was chosen from theproposals put forward by Australia, Eranoe and Italy.      &quot;11
^*     The Italian delegate outlined the three possible courses of actionopen to European countries in the field of heavy launchers:   to continue their collaborative programmes (ELDO), to abandon ELDO and iepend on the goodwill of the United States, or to pursue independent national progrannesof their own.     The Italian Government felt that ELDO-A must be conpletedjin any case this would cost little nore than cancellation at this stage.However, they were willing to consider a re-adjustment *jf the prograrxiesand of the distribution of contributions if the United Kingdon were toremain in the Organisation,     The Italian delegate went on to stress theconfusion, higher eosts and duplications of effort which arose fron theexistenoe of three different space organisations in Europe, and he askwlthat the Conference should consider the feasibility of setting up aco*-or inating organisation.     This night at one extreme involve the nergingof the ELDO, ESE.0 and CETS Secretariats;   at -the other extrene it might beno more than a permanent, co-ordinating committee of national representatives.If one organisation were to be responsible for all European space activities,it could be arranged that all members would not be obliged to participate in all the programmesa     The Italian Government had drawn up a draft 1convention for the establishment of a co-ordinating body which they w ereprepared to submit to the Conference.- At a lator stage, and following therecommendation of an ad hoc working group, &quot;the Conference agreed to set upa preparatory committee of national representatives to examine theseproposals in greater detail,7.     The Erenoh delegate pointed out that the British BLUE STREAK projecthad been saved through its adoption by ELDO   for the first stage of ELDO-A.At this tine, six years ago, the French had shown their faith in european co-operation through ELDO by abandoning her awn plans to construct anational heavy launcher,    France recovered In contracts only 75 per c entof her contribution to ELDO, and thus got a smaller return than most of the member-States,     This 25 per cent deficit was unliealthy from the long-term vieY/point, and it should be appreoiatad that France had solutionsother than also open to her - as an alternative she could embark on a major national programme, perhaps with the assistance of extra-european countries.(3)
8,     He went on to describe ine new technical opportunity which was offered to the organisation by the proposal to add perigee and apogeemotors to the ELDO-A launcher (ELDO-PAS).     Prom an equatorial siteELDO-PAS could put a 200 kg. satellite into geostationery orbit.    with it, all technical objectives, with the exception of direct TVtransmission, would be vdthin the scope of ELDO.     The transfer system was undoubtedly feasible:   the perigee-motor system was already availablein Europe,, and.the- apogee moter presented no serious technical problems.9.     The launching site was a natter of particular importance:   it hadto be near the Equator, in&apos; a thinly-populated area, and with goodaccessibility and transport facilities.   In the Prenoh view Guiana wasthe only suitable site that had been proposed.     The Guiana site wasbeing, developed for civilian purposes only.     They wereconstructing a military centre   in the Landes in , iPrance.     If another site was favoured by ELDO (for example, inAustralia), Prance would be in a difficult situation, as she couldnot contemplate the construction of three centres simultaneously.The French delegation would not understand any deferment of a decisionon this important Issue by -the conference.(0
(5)10.   The ELDO-PAS launcher would have many uses:for scientifio research satellites in low orbits (1200 leg),eccentric orbits (300 kg) and lunar orbits;for telecommunications, TV diffusion and relaying;for navigational aids and control of air traffic, andfor meteorology.It was a broad field.     Once it had been defined it would be necessary to lay down a luncher production programme and to find out who would buy the launcher.     If the conditions 3he had indicated were met, and if theother member countries did something of the same kind, Prance would, asa positive gesture, undertake to buy at least two launchers.     commitments to purchase were essential.     It would also be necessary to have supplycommitments - guarantees by the Member States that they would continue to manufacture and supply those components for which they had awoeptedresponsibility.     Without this the default of any one oountry oouldparalyse the whole programme.     Exclusion or rejection from theorganisation would not be a sufficient penalty for suoh default.     more stringent penalties would be needed in the form of compensation payments to the other countries.11.   It was clear that some structural modifications to the Secretariatwere needed in order to reflect the changing character of theerganisation which was now becoming tc some extent an industrial under-taking.     The political and administrative tasks of the Secretariat were now less important.     It was also desirable to strengthen theSecretariats control ever the management of the national sections ofthe programmes by means of a new committee and a team of inspectors.12.   In subsequent speeches it was argued strongly that a Europeanlauneher capability was necessary.    Without it Europe would be dependant em other countries for the launching of scientific and communications satellites, and would fall behind in certain importantareas of technology.     It was highly desirable that the conference should reach a decision on the initial programme, even though the subsequent programmes might require further study.13.   The Minister of Aviation,   in his second speech, outlined theBritish contribution to ELDO end re-affirmed British interest in european co-operation.     After referring to the proportion of herresources which the United Kingdom oould afford to devote to research and development, the Minister of Aviation went on to state, that, despiteall that had been said, the United Kingdom still had serious doubts
about the ELDO programmes and that, unless these were removed, she wouldhave no alternative but to end her present commitments to the Organisation.He continued that he &quot;must make it clear to avoid any misunderstandingthat in any event my Government will not feel able to support the ELDO-Bprogrammes or to agree to undertake any commitments in respect of them&quot;.He then said that the ELDO-PAS proposals -required further time for study andthat it would not be possible to reach a final decision on them at thisConferenae.     He undertook, however, to let the ELDO partners know theresults of the British studies within the next three months and he supported a suggestion that another Ministerial meeting might be heldearly in June.14-.   There was general agreement with the United Kingdom&apos;s proposal foran adjournment of the Conference in order that further studies could bemade by the member countries and by the ELDO Secretariat of the ELDO-PASproposal and of the question of an equatorial launching site.     It wasagreed that the meeting should be re-convened in Paris on 9th June, 1.966-.The French delegate considered it was essential that in June theConference should reach firm decisions on the completion of ELDO-A, onELDO-PAS and on the choice of an equatorial base for operational launches.The questions relating to the structure of the Secretariat and theco-ordination ef European space activities could also be discussed.The Conference then agreed en the Resolution set out below.Resolution by the Ministerial conference the CONFERENCEHaving noted all the problems of concern to ELDO in the light ofthe latest technological advances, the needs of potential users, mattersrelevant to a co-ordination of space policy in Europe and pre-occupationsrecently voiced -1. - FINDS that all these problems require closer study.2. - DECIDES to resume its proceedings in Paris on 9th June 1966to reach decisions on:(a) completion of the Initial Programme;(b) the possible upgrading of performance of the EUROPA 1launcher to meet not only ESRO requirements but alsospacifications for a geostationary communicationssatellite;(c) the choioe of equatorial site for operational firingsof the launchers;(d) the financial and industrial participation of the member Countries.(6)
3. - DECIDES to examine on 9th June 19-56 a preliminary reporton the other outstanding questions, particularly thepossibilities of future programmes and the status ofstudies concerning them, together with the establishmentof a guarantee system for the supply of launchers and the adaptation of the Organisation&apos;s structures to its new tasks.2f. - DECIDES to establish a Study Committee, composed ofrepresentatives of the governments of ELDO Member Countries,charged with examining measures for improving theco-ordination of space policy in Europe, and in particularharmonising the attitudes of the national Delegations tothe European Organisations, and instructs the Committee toreport back to the June session of the Conference.5. - INSTRUCTS the Secretariat to continue, In co-operation withthe Member Gountries, the examination of all aspects ofthe problems in question on the basis of the reports by working Groups A, B and C of the Conferenoe and theSeeretary-General&apos;s report (ELDO/CM(April 66) 16), andto prepare concrete proposals on the points listed inparagraph 2.(7)
ANNEX CAj^ICAN B1TBREST IN ELDOThe United States Government have expressed the strong hope thatELDO will remain in being and that the United Kingdom will remain in it.They are studying ways of providing technical help towards realisingELDO&apos;s programmes and would welcome suggestions from ELDO or theUnited Kingdom.2.     American motives appear to be -(a) the desire to preserve and promote multilateral oo-operation in Europe j(b) the conviction that the development in Europe of space technology, including launcher technology, and the stimulus to innovation and industrial development directed therefrom,is an essential element in strengthening the West throughthe reduction of disparities in teohnologioal performancebetween the two sides of the Atlantic:   they argue thatEuropean dependence on borrowed Amerioan techniques is nosubstitute for experience directly gained and an unsatis-factory basis for any worthwhile United States-Europeanpartnership;(c) the fear that the withdrawal of Britain and the breakdown ofELDO as at present organised will encourage the proliferationin Europe of national (primarily French, but also German)strategic delivery capabilities.r3.    While believing for these reasons that ELD0*s survival is in theenlightened long-term self-interest of the United States, the UnitedStates Government are at present unable, for shorter-term reasons ofCongressional and commercial pressure, to offer to Britain or to europe the assurance that they could rely upon -American launchers forlaunching European satellites of all kinds.COWFIDEMTIAL9 C 9
C^o-or^jj^ati^qn      snacj^oli^oy in Europe1.     The resumed ELDO Ministerial Conference will consider among etherthings the report of a study committee set up on 28th April to examine&quot;measures for improving the co-ordination of space policy in Europe&quot;.2.     Three European co-operative organisations, ELDO, ESRO and CETS, are engaged in different branches of space activity.     They were set upseparately at different times for different purposes and with differentmemberships.     The European members of ELDO are members of both the other two.     They collectively provide an overwhelming share of the resourcesof ESRO and the same is likely to be true of CETS.     Although the fields of activity of these organisations are related (ELDO being concerned -withlaunchers and the other two with satellites respectively for space research and telecommunications), each is separate and &quot;sovereign&quot; in its own field.None has any formal obligation to make use of the products of the others.3.     A fully co-ordinated space policy would require agreement between the member states of all three organisations on common policy objectives.   Thosemight include a programme of scientific experiments involving satellites(though scientists would oppose any attempt te determine the cantcnt^of. thoseprogrammes);   the development of a Luropoan telecommunications and televisionsatellite capability;    and the development of a European launcher.4-     Criticism of the present lack of so-ordination began in the Assembliesof the v?EU and the Council of Europe and has now been taken up by a numberof the governments who are our partners in ELDO.     They argue that anagreement on objectives on the above lines should be buttressed byco-ordination of action in the three organisations, and that this could        ilead to economies in administrative and. technical staffs.     The degreeof co-ordination advocated by different governments varies from a loosearrangement in which each organisation would retain its separateindividuality to measures of integration which would result in theformation of a single European organisation dealing with space matters.5.     The force of the arguments for some measure of co-ord.ination is not: contested in principle by the United Kingdom.     But our view of the actionto be undertaken is conditioned by uncertainty as to the future of ELDOas an organisation.     If ELDO were to disappear, the bodies to be&quot;co-ordinated&quot; would be reduced to two, and, in that event, it is quitelikely also that present tentative plans for carrying forward the(ijANNEX D.
CONFIDENTIAL &quot;        264development of a telecommunications satellite by CETS would also be dropped,leaving a single organisation, ESRO, in the field.     If, on the other hand,ELDO were to survive and the United Kingdom to remain a member our attitude would depend upon the view taken by Ministers of our interests in ESRO.Any substantial measure, whether of &quot;co-ordination&quot; or of &quot;integration&quot;between the three organisations might Involve some restrictions on E3R0lspresent freedom of action.     The scientists, supported by DES and SRC,feel that technological interests and the heavier expenditure in ELDO,compared with ESRO, might damage the scientific programme.     They considerthat ESPO is now getting into its stride and that it would be a mistake to jeopardise its future.     Moreover a closer measure of integration might mean that ESRO could not avoid using the ELDO launcher, whatever the costand other disadvantages to the ESRO budget and progrannes.     The possibleconflict between this point of view and the interests of the ELDOgovernments in maximising the use of an eventual ELDO launcher can hardly be resolved in advance of a decision on ELDO&apos;a future and Britain&apos;sparticipation in it,6,     In discussions in the Study Committee the United kingdom representative accordingly adopted a position of caution and reserve,!However all other members except Australia were in favour in principleof an eventual amalgamation of ELDO, ESRO and CETS, and were able tosecure the inclusion (subject to a United Kingdom reservation) of astatement to this effect in the Study Committee&apos;s report.     The latter is not yet available, but it is expected to recommend the establishmentof :-(a) a Conference of Ministers of ELDO States on a permanent basis,to be enlarged to include Ministers of states belonging toESRO and CETS, but not ELDO;(b) a Committee of ministers Deputies, to neet at least everythree months;(c) a Co-ordinating committee consisting of the secretariats of thethree organisations, to be responsible for such co-ordinationof their activities as is immediately possible and empowered tomake recommendations to the Councils of ELDO and ESRO and toCETS:(d) a study Committee to consider the problem of the fusion of thethree existing bodies.In addition the report will probably express the hope that member states will take steps tc co-ordinate their own space activities internally.7*     Other members of ELDO, particularly Italy and Belgium, will continueto press for the integration of the three organisations.     Eor the reasonsstated above we plainly cannot support this at present.
