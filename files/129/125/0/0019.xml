SF.CR.GT13 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 69 COPY NO. _10th May, 1966CABINETIRON AND STEEL NATIONALISATIONMemorandum by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic affairs at their meeting on 7th April (CC(66) 18th Conclusions, Minute 4)the Cabinet asked the Ministerial Committee on Iron and steel nationalisation to consider whether it would be desirable to extend theprovisions of the Bill to the British Iron and Steel Federation (BISF)as well as the timing of the introduction of the Bill within the 1966/67Session.    The Committee considered these problems on 3rd May and reached the following conclusions.British Iron and Steel Federation2.      The Committee v/ere fully agreed that it would be unwise to try and deal with the problems rasied by the existence of the BISF in theBill now to be introduced.    The main objections to doing so are asf ollows:-(a) The BISF is not a legal entity and we are far from having anyfull knowledge of the complex organisation of either theFederation itself or its various subsidiary companies.    nor have we any power to obtain this information.    In this situation the drafting of satisfactory provisions about theFederation presents immense difficulties.    It would alsomean that the introduction of the Bill would have to be delayed.(b) The inclusion in the Bill of satisfactory provisions about theFederation would almost certainly make it a &quot;hybrid&quot;Bill.    Although with our increased majority this would not prevent the passing of the Bill, it would greatly slow down the speed of progress through both Houses of parliament and might make it impossible to pass the Bill in a singlesession.    This would delay the date at which the NationalSteel Corporation would take over-effective control of theindustry.    We are all agreed that this should be achieved assoon as possible in order to give the maximum time forstructural reorganisation of the industry before the nextElection.    This is the best hope for ensuring that this settlement of the steel industry&apos;s affairs will be a lastingone.-1-
3.       The Minister of Power believes that it should be possible to achieve our objectives in relation to the Federation by negotiation now that it is clear that nationalisation will be carried through.    Thiswould involve an early withdrawal of the nationalised companies fromthe Federation and the early transfer of the central trading activities to the National Steel Corporation.    If for any reason this provedimpractical it would be possible to have a further short Bill to dealwith the Federation and this could be drafted with full knowledge of theorganisation and structure of the Federation obtained by the Corporation.We also intend to do what is possible to ensure that the Directors of the nationalised companies are not placed in a position v/here there wouldbe any conflict between their responsibilities to the nationalised industryand their interests outside the nationalised sector.Timing and Introduction4.      The Committee discussed the advantages and disadvantages ofdelaying the introduction of the Bill until the autumn which would,among other things, give a further opportunity to see if the steelindustry now has any new and specific ideas on the future of the industry.The general view of the Committee v/as that nothing would be gained bydelay and a good deal would be lost.    Delaying introduction would meandelay in taking over effective control;  and for the reasons given inparagraph 2(b) above this would be most undesirable.    Moreover, thegeneral view was that delay in introduction would reduce the chances of getting co-operation from those elements in the industry who areprepared to discuss with us how best to organise the industry afternationalisation.    It would lead to increasing practical difficulties inthe development of the industry.    For these reasons we think it important that the Second Reading of the Bill should be taken as soonas possible.Compensation5.       The Committee also agreed that we should not consider ourselvesbound by the precise terms of compensation set out in the vThite Paperalthough the general basis for determining compensation ought to beretained.    The provisions for compensation have been reviewed bythe Ministers principally concerned on this basis.G.3.Department of Economic Affairs, 3.W.1,10th May, 1966
