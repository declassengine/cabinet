Seamen&apos;s StrikeNeed for Special ActionA Proclamation of Emergency was made and emergency regulations were promulgated on 23rd May.   A new Proclamationand new Regulations will be required on &quot;Wednesday, 22nd June;and the necessary arrangements for this have now been made.The Regulations will, subject to one minor addition relating to air transport, be the same as those now in force.   They will haveto be debated in both Houses of Parliament.2.     Up to now it has been unnecessary to make use of emergency powers.   The expected consequences of the strike havefortunately developed much more slowly than was expected.Supplies of essential commodities are, in general, adequate and prices have remained relatively stable.   Production for exporthas not been much affected so far by difficulties over shipmentand a substantial proportion of the goods is getting away.   Thereis no immediate prospect of petrol rationing.Shortages of industrialsupplies may lead to unemployment in Northern Ireland,    It hasbeen necessary to use Service transport to take supplies of food,fuel and feeding stuffs to the Scottish islands; but in the restof the country normal transport has sufficed.3.     The policy followed in considering suggestions of specialaction to deal with the strike situation has been to avoidarrything which would be likely to result in strike action byother unions, and so make a more damagihg impact on the economy of the country than is being suffered as a direct consequence ofthe seamen&apos;s strike.    It is suggested that this policy should becontinued for as long as possible.li*     As regards the ports themselves, a substantial number ofvacant berths are still available.   Tugmen and other workers have co-operated in moring ships and there has been little trouble with the dockers.   There is a risk that if the strike continuesfor much longer and more of these berths are occupied by laid upBritish ships the remaining berths will be inadequate to enableother ships arriving at the ports to discharge their cargoes.    Ifthis situation arises, it may be necessary to establish portemergency committees under the Emergency Regulations, and empowerthem to select the ships to be unloaded - preference being givento foreign ships.   It is the wish of the port authorities thatsuch action should be deferred for as long as possible, becausethe consequences of taking it are unpredictable.   It might wellbring to an end existing co-operation by other unions and lead to serious trouble in the docks.5.     As regards other forms of transport, it has so far been our policy not to authorise exceptional services under ordinary powersunless it was clearly necessary to do so for the purpose ofmaintaining essential supplies.    It is felt that this policy should now be modified to the extent of interpreting &quot;essential supplies&quot; more liberally - to include, for example, the conveyance of materials which are essential to the maintenance of employmentin a particular area.    It should be emphasised, however, thatthe extent to which carrying capacity can be augmented in this wajis very limited.6.     The possibility of taking action, under emergency powers tomaintain exports or to carry essential supplies to industry -assuming that emergency powers can properly be used for these purposes - is being kept under review.    It seems most unlikely,
however, that any substantial freight could &quot;be carried either bythe Services or by aircraft or road vehicles which are not atpresent being fully used.   It is also to &quot;be expected that any major use of emergency powers for such purposes would have serious consequences on the willingness of other trade vunions toco-operate to the extent they are now doing in maintaining thenormal life of the community.7.     To sum up, it is suggested that the existing policy of avoiding emergency action which could have serious consequenceson the willingness of the dockers, the transport workers, and perhaps other people, to continue as they have been doing withtheir normal work should be maintained, but that departments should exercise somewhat more liberally their ordinary powers toauthorise the exceptional, use of air or road transport orotherwise to facilitate the movement of goods.
