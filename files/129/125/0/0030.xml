k.i Eli fr\3b a, 83143IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)67C(66) 80 COPY NO. .17th June, 1966CABINETPRICES AND INCOMES bill memorandum by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic AffairsWe are committed to reintroduce shortly the Prices and incomes Bill which was published just before the dissolution of the lastParliament.    My colleagues will recall that the Bill is designed toreconstitute the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) on a statutory basis and to give the Government reserve powers, which wouldbe used only after consultation with both sides of industry and an affirmative resolution by both Houses of Parliament, to operate a statutory &quot;early warning&quot; scheme for prices or pay or for both,2,     I do not need to remind my colleagues of the reasons for introducing the Bill, which is an important part of our programme for strengthening the voluntary prices and incomes policy which is in turna key element of our policies for securing more rapid and .sustainedeconomic growth.    The decision to introduce legislation on this basiswas taken by the Cabinet at the beginning of September, 1965, and themain provisions of the Bill were approved by my colleagues in sub-sequent discussions (CC(65) 46th Conclusions, Minute 1,CC(65) 57th Conclusions, Minute 5 and CC(66) 1st Conclusions,Minute 3).    I do not propose therefore that we should go over the oldground again or that the Cabinet should concern itself with the detailsof the Bill (which will shortly be coming before the legislation committee for this purpose).    But my colleagues will wish to beinformed of the main changes we are proposing to make to the Bill aspublished in February and I would welcome their views on the mainoutstanding problems.Changes which have been made in the bill . A revised print of the Bill is attached. The main changes whichhave been made are as follows.Change in Ministerial functions4.     The Bill as published in February provided for all functions tobe exercised by the Secretary of State (in practice, myself).&apos;    Therewas also provision for price and pay notifications to be made to &quot;theappropriate Minister&quot; as defined in regulations to be made by theSecretary of State.-1-
5.       I have new had a number of changes made which are designed to reflect the change in Ministerial responsibilities for prices and incomes policy announced in Parliament on 25th May.     The Bill now provides for references to be made tc the NBPI either by the Secretary of State alone or acting jointly with another Minister of Ministers.    Where a jointreference is made then all the other Ministerial functions under the Billconnected with that reference v/ill be exercised jointly by the sameMinisters.    The Bill also provides for the &quot;appropriate Minister&quot; towhom a price of pay notification has been given to consent to the ending of a thirty day &quot;early warning&quot; period if it has been decided that thecase concerned is not to be referred to the Board.     The Secretary ofState will remain solely responsible for appointing the NBPI, for making orders varying the principles in the White Paper on Prices and incomes Policy, and for making orders specifying the categories ofprices or pay claims or settlements of which notification is required.Dividends6.       Clause 2(1) has been amended to make it clear beyond any possible doubt that dividend cases may be referred to the NBPI.    Inaddition, a new clause (Clause 11) has been drafted giving power torequire the notification of company dividends and other types of distribution in Part II of the Bill.    This is discussed further inparagraphs 14-22 below.Notification of claims by the TUC and individual unions7.       At the request of the TUC Economic Committee, I have arranged for Clause 12 to be amended to enable the TUC to take overthe liability of its individual members for notifying claims, and for individual unions similarly to be able to accept liability on behalf oftheir members submitting claims, if they so wish.    I think that this isa useful provision, which could help to strengthen central authority inthe trade union movement.Period for the Board&apos;s reports8.       Clause 18 has been revised to enable the three month period forthe NBPI&apos;s reports to be extended in any case in which a standstill nolonger applies.     This means that a standstill cannot be longer than three months (plus in seme cases the thirty day &quot;early warning&quot; period)but that in cases in v/hich a standstill has been terminated for any reason the Board can be given more time to produce its report^ or its final report.Penalties under the bill.       We have taken care not tc provide for imprisonment as a penalty for offences under the Bill.     The penalties for which the Bill px*ovidesar e: -(i)  a maximum fine of  50 on summary conviction for failure togive ^evidence required by the NBPI for one of its enquiries,or for failure to observe a requirement under Part II tcnotify a pay claim, award, or settlement, or increase inc c rap any distribution;
-3-(ii)  a maximum fine of  100 on summary conviction, and amaximum fine of  500 (except in the case of corporatebodies where there is no maximum) on conviction in ahigher court, for failure to observe a requirement underPart II to notify a price increase or to observe a thirtyday &quot;early warning&quot; period pending consideration by theGovernment or to observe a standstill of up to three monthspending investigation by the NBPI.These are reasonable penalties for the offences under the Bill.    They arelikely to affect employers more than workers, since employers have muchmore extensive obligations under Part II,    Moreover, no prosecution canbe instituted for an offence under Part II of the Bill without the consentof the appropriate law officer of the Crown who will be able to take intoaccount all the circumstances of the particular case.10.     However, if   any offender failed to pay a fine imposed on him under the Bill, the court which sentenced him could, under the existing law and at its own discretion, either exact the fine by distraint on the offender&apos;s goods or commit him to prison.    I am very anxious to avoidas faz&quot; as possible any risk that an offender against the Prices and incomes Bill might be sent to prison, if only because of the opportunityfor &quot;martyrdom&quot; which this could offer.    I have therefore been considering in consultation with the Home Secretary possible ways of removing this risk or reducing it still further,11.     Ofte possibility would be specifically to exclude the possibility of imprisonment under the Bill and. to rely solely on distraint for the enforcement of fines.    The difficulty is that distraint in its present formis ineffective, and even if it could be made more effective it might offeras much scope for &quot;martyrdom&quot; as the alternative of imprisonment.12.     The alternative remedy of attachment of earnings would be likelyto be a more effective method of enforcing fines, and I have therefore considered with the Home Secretary whether it would be possible toprovide for a.ttachment in the Prices and Incomes Bill,     But this course is also not without difficulty.    The appearance of attachment as a meansof enforcing fines under the Prices and Incomes Bill could imply thatthis method is specially suitable for deeding with offences under this Bill.This would be questionable.    A trade union that wanted to flout the lawwould be unlikely to act as a fine collector in respect of its officers,and could be convicted of disobedience to the attachment order.Moreover, there is no ready-made provision for attachment for fines.The provision in the Maintenance Orders Act, 195 8, on which a newprovision would have to be modelled, is ten sections long and it wouldtake time to make the necessary adaptations, including one for providingfor the attachment of income other than wages, to which the TTJC attach importance.!13.     I have therefore come to the conclusion that it would be preferable for any changes in the existing law for the  enforcement of fines to be madeon a general basis if possible and not simply in relation to the Prices and incomes Bill.    The Home Secretary is currently considering the general problem of the enforcement of fines and hopes to be in a position toinclude a provision for the attachment of earnings in the Criminal justice bill to be introduced in the autumn.    Subject to the views of rny colleagues,
-4-I propose to say in introducing the Prices and Incomes Bill that thegeneral question of enforcement is currently under consideration by theGovernment and that the Home Secretary hopes to be able to introduceproposals in the autumn.    If in the event it does not prove possible tointroduce general proposals in the autumn, we should be ready toconsider   amending the Prices and Incomes Bill at the committee stage.The treatment of dividends under the Bill14.     The other main criticism of the published Bill which has beenmade by our supporters is that it fails to deal adequately with dividends.The endorsement of the Bill by the General Council of the TUC shortly before it was published in February was subject to an amendment torequire the notification of proposed increases in dividends.15.     We have from the start made it clear that our policy is entirely different from that of our predecessors, in that it covers prices as wellas all types of incomes, not just wages and salaries.    We have also said that our treatment of different forms of income must take accountof differences in the way in which they are .earned.     In the case of dividends we have established two main principles:-(i) Aggregate profits, part of v/hich are paid out in the form of dividends, should not rise excessively compared with thegrowth of total wages and salaries (after allowing for short-term fluctuations).    We are formally pledged to use ourfiscal powers or other appropriate means to correct anysuch excess.    I have stated publicly, in Parliament and elsewhere, that we are keeping a careful watch on the trend of dividends in particular and that we shall not hesitate totake any action which seems necessary.     In addition, theNational Economic Development Council is charged with theduty of keeping under review the general movement of prices and of money incomes of all kinds, including dividends.    Wehave already introduced the corporation tax v/ith the intentionof limiting the proportion of profits distributed to shareholdersin the future.(ii) The profits of individual companies, and accordingly the scope for dividend distributions, should be restrained by the workingof the prices policy.    The White Paper specifically providesfor increases in profits or dividends based on excessivemarket power to be referred to the NBPI as indicating scope for price reductions.    Under the NBPI&apos;s terms of referencewe have the power to refer any question relating to money incomes for examination (and I have amended the Bill tomake it clear beyond any possible doubt that this includesdividends).    The reference of profits and dividends of the clearing banks shows that we are ready to use this power in any case we judge desirable.    I am looking for otherdividend cases suitable for reference.
r-&apos;&apos;SDENTIAL16.     In this approach to the problem of dividends we have tried to reconcile the requirements of economic efficiency with the requirementsof social justice.    We are in effect applying the incomes criteria toprofits and dividends only in the aggregate, and the prices criteria to individual cases.    But the fact that we are not applying the incomescriteria directly to individual dividends cases, for general economic reasons, still lays us open to the criticism of unfairness.    And mycolleagues are well aware of the psychological importance of dividendsamongst our supporters.17.     I have therefore considered again whether we could treat thernin the same way as wages and salaries, and in particular whether wecould make them subject to standstill under the Prices and Incomes Bill,Such a course is open to the following objections:-(a) Any suggestion that a particular &quot;norm&quot; should apply to alldividend payments would discourage efficiency, the provisionof capital for risk investment, and distort the allocation ofcapital resources.    There is in any case no economicreason why dividend distributions of companies should riseby 3-3-1 per cent or any other figure.(b) There would be considerable practical difficulties in operatinga standstill scheme for dividends.    A requirement for &quot;early warning&quot; of proposed dividend increases 30 days before these were generally known would involve serious risks of theimproper use of privileged knowledge.    Three monthstandstills for dividend proposals under investigation by theN3PI would involve uncertainty on the Stock Exchange andno doubt encourage speculation.    It might also be necessaryto amend the existing companies legislation to enable suchstandstills to be imposed.18.     In the light of these objections I have concluded that a provisionfor the compulsory notification of dividends, without giving power toimpose stand stills, is as far as we should go.    Clause 11 in theattached print of the Bill has been drafted on this basis.    This should be helpful insofar as it will enable us to ensure that we have all theinformation v/e need on dividends and other forms of company distribu-tions to keep individual cases under review and to make references tothe NBPI where appropriate.    The existence of this power may also have the effect of making companies more hesitant to increase dividendsunjustifiably.19.     When I discussed the treatment of dividends with the TUC EconomicCommittee after the election they accepted, albeit with some reluctance,that this was as far as we could go in the Bill,    They appeared to be impressed by the practical difficulties of preventing persons in thecompany or elsewhere from using information which has not yet beenmade public for the purpose of personal gain.    They thought that evena limited provision on the lines suggested above would be helpful in presenting the Bill to public opinion.-5-
20.     However, I feel that I must draw my colleagues attention to thefact that even with this provision we are likely to be accused of unfairnessin treating this form of personal income in a way which is different from the treatment of wages and salaries.Constitution of the NBPI21.     There is one other important change which I should like to make to the Bill.    In its present form this provides only for ad hocreferences to the NBPI on which the Board is normally required toreport within three months.    I think it would be desirable in additionto provide for standing references relating to particular subjects whichthe Board could be asked to keep under review and to report on fromtime to time as requested or as it saw fit.    The pay of unversity teachers (which I discuss in a separate paper (C(66) 82)) could be thesubject of a standing reference of this kind.     There might also beneed at some future time for standing references of price questions incertain circumstances.    It would also be desirable to provide forspecial appointments to the Board and for separate procedures where necessary in relation to such standing references.22.     If my colleagues agree in principle that it is desirable toprovide for future developments of this kind, I will arrange for thenecessary amendments to be incorporated in the existing draft.    Mycolleagues will, of course, have an opportunity of commenting on the detailed provisions proposed.Unilateral Pay i Awards23.    My colleagues may like to be aware of one other problem whichhas arisen in relation to the definition of &quot;awards and settlements&quot; inthe Bill.    I am advised that this definition could not be held to coverincreases in pay granted &quot;unilaterally&quot; by an employer without any claim having been lodged and without any negotiation or discussion withthe employee.    I do not think that this is of very great practical importance since it seems unlikely that we should want to catchincreases of this kind which are normally given on an individual basis.But it is of political and presentational importance to be able to say thatthe powers under Part II of the Bill are wide enough to catch any typeof case so that the existence of the powers could act as some deterrenteven though they were never used.    I am. therefore consulting the attorney General about the best way of handling this problem.Timetable24.     I propose to bring the Bill before the Legislation Committee on28th June and to publish it shortly after for a Second Reading on13th July.    Before publication I shall need to inform the TUC and CBIof our proposals on dividends.Conclusion25.     I invite my colleagues to endorse these proposals, including therecommendations in paragraphs 13 and 22-23 above.   I would alsowelcome their views in particular on the problem of dividends.G.B.Department of Economic Affairs, S. W. 1.16th June, 1966

They have also agreed with the Governments proposals, setout in the White Paper on Machinery of Prices and Incomes Policy(Cmnd. 2577) that:20      (i) the National Economic Development Council should keep under review the general movement of prices and of money incomes of all kinds ; and(ii) a National Board for Prices and Incomes should be setup to examine particular cases in order to advise whether25 or not the behaviour of prices or of wages, salaries or othermoney incomes is in the national interest as defined by theGovernment after consultation with Management and unions.Trends in national productivity30 3. The figure for the growth of the economy between 1964 and1970 which is being assumed in the preparation of the Government&apos;splan for economic development is 25 per cent. This gives an average annual rate of growth of rather less than 4 per cent. In calculating the long-term annual rate of growth of national production per35 head of the working population allowance- has to be made for thegrowth of the total national output due to increases in the numbersof the working population and for short-term variations in the rateof growth which result from fluctuations in the level of demand and the level of employment.  The most recent forecasts indicate40 that between 1964 and 1970 the labour force may grow, as the resultof the natural increase in the population of working age and thecontinuance of rising trends in the proportions working or seeking work, by no more than 1  per cent, over the whole period. some further increase in the numbers employed should result from the45 more vigorous regional policies to which the Government iscommitted4. These assumptions imply an average annual rate of growth in output per head of something approaching 3  per cent. During the
Sch. 2 early years of the plan period the underlying rate of growth will inevitably be below the average for the period as a whole ; in addition the rate of increase may be slowed down by reductions in working hours and extension of holidays. By comparison the underlying rateof growth per head in the nineteen-fifties averaged about 2 per cent. 5a year. It is now probably about 3 per cent.Considerations of the national interest \5. Against this background the Government have now drawnup, after consultation with Management and Unions, a statementof considerations which should be taken into account if the pricing 10policy of individual enterprises and increases in money incomes areto conform to the national interest and in particular to achieve the objectives accepted by Management and Unions in the Joint State-ment of Intent on Productivity, Prices and Incomes. these considerations are outlined below. They will help all those concerned 15with determining prices and incomes to act in a manner consistent with the national interest. They are also intended to guide theNational Board for Prices and Incomes in its examination ofparticular cases.Considerations affecting prices 206. The development of an effective policy for keeping the general level of prices stable will call for considerable efforts on the partof management generally to increase efficiency, avoid cost increases ,and wherever possible to stabilise or reduce prices.  The rate of change of the average level of prices over any period of time is 25determined by differing movements of a very large number of individual prices.  Even when the average level of prices is rising,there are many prices which fall.  It would be impossible to lay down detailed rules which would cover all the circumstances which individual enterprises face when deciding the prices to ask for their 30products.   On the other hand, unless some general guidance isgiven on the circumstances in which it might be appropriate toraise or reduce prices, there will be no basis for deciding whetherindividual price decisions are consistent with the national objectives.The considerations set out in paragraphs 9-10 are for the guidance 35of all concerned with the determination of prices.7. It is not intended that the considerations set out in para-graphs 9-10 should inhibit the structural changes that will benecessary in the interests of faster economic growth. These take account of the fact that competition has an important part to play 40in stimulating economic expansion, and are consistent with the smoothworking of a competitive system. It should be a normal part ofenterprising business behaviour to increase efficiency, keep down costs and hold prices at a level compatible with its long-term growth. Thiswould speed up the replacement of old techniques and out-of-date 45equipment by new techniques and modern equipment. Moreover,the considerations recognise not only that an enterprise must makesufficient profit to secure the capital necessary to meet home and overseas demand, but also that the vigorous and efficient enterprisecan reasonably expect a higher level of profit than one that is not. 50
8. These considerations apply equally to the prices of goods and Sch. 2of services whether provided by private or public enterprise. TheGovernment regard the nationalised industries as being under thesame obligations as private enterprises to contribute to the general5 objective of price stability, while taking account of their financialand social obligations.Criteria for price behaviour9. To keep the general level of prices stable, it is vital that price increases should be avoided where possible and that prices shouldJO be reduced wherever circumstances permit.  Enterprises will not beexpected to raise their prices except in the following circumstances:(i) if output per employee cannot be increased sufficiently toallow wages and salaries to increase at a rate consistent with the criteria for incomes stated in paragraph 15 below15 without some increase in prices, and no offsetting reduc-tions can be made in non-labour costs per unit of outputor in the return sought on investment;(ii) if there are unavoidable increases in non-labour costs suohas materials, fuel, services or marketing costs per unit of20 output which cannot be offset by reductions in labour orcapital costs per unit of output or in the return soughton investment;(iii) if there are unavoidable increases in capital costs per unit of output which cannot be offset by reductions in non-25           capital costs per unit of output or in the return soughton investment;(iv) if, after every effort has been made to reduce costs, the enterprise is unable to secure the capital required to meethome and overseas demand.30 10. Enterprises will be expected to reduce their prices in thefollowing circumstances:(i) if output per employee is increasing faster than the rate of increase in wages and salaries which is consistent with the criteria for incomes stated in paragraph 15 below, and35 there are no offsetting and unavoidable increases in non-labour costs per unit of output;(ii) if the costs of materials, fuel or services per unit of outputare falling and there are no offsetting and unavoidableincreases in labour or capital costs per unit of output;40 (iii) if capital costs per unit of output are falling and there areno offsetting and unavoidable increases in non-capital costs per unit of output;(iv) if profits are based on excessive market power.Considerations affecting incomes policy^ 11. The development of an effective policy for keeping increases in money incomes in line with increases in real national output will call for considerable efforts on the part of unions and manage-ment and all others concerned with the determination of incomes.
Sch. 2 The object must be to increase productivity and efficiency as rapidly as possible in order to raise real incomes and to avoid,wherever possible, increases in money incomes that push up costs and prices. An important step will be to lay down a &quot; norm&quot;indicating the average rate of annual increase of money incomes 5per head which is consistent with stability in the general level ofprices. In present circumstances the appropriate figure for thispurpose is 3-3  per cent. This would be subject to re-examination by the Government in the light of reviews to be conducted from timeto time by the National Economic Development Council. 10Employment incomes12. Wages and salaries are determined by many factors, includingchanges in the supply and demand for different kinds of labour,trends in productivity and profits, comparisons with levels or trendsof incomes in other employments and changes in the cost of living. 15The weight given to these different factors varies with circum-stances. They are also influenced by the policies which the Govern-ment pursue in relation to the distribution of incomes.   TheGovernment in the Joint Statement of Intent on Productivity, prices and Incomes have affirmed that their social objective is to ensure 20that the benefits of faster growth are distributed in a way thatsatisfies the claims of social need and justice.  It is in that contextthat the following considerations are set out for the guidance ofall those concerned with the determination of wages and salaries.13. If wages and salaries per head are to keep in step with the 25long-term rate of increase in national productivity, less weight than hitherto will have to be given to the factors mentioned in para-graph 12 and more weight will have to be given to the incomesnorm. Moreover, in applying the norm to wages and salaries, itwill be necessary to take into account not only increases in wage 30and salary rates, but also increases in costs resulting from reductions in working hours without loss of pay, from higher rates of pay for overtime or shift work and from improvements in fringe benefits.14. It would be impracticable and undesirable to lay downdetailed rules so as to provide an indication of what changes in 35wages and salaries were warranted case by case.   Nor would itbe desirable to inhibit the structural changes necessary in theinterests of faster growth.  However, experience has shown that in conditions v of full employment the normal processes of collective bargaining both at national and local level can result in pay increases 40which are inflationary in effect.   It is accordingly important toensure that increases in wages and salaries above the norm shouldbe confined to cases in which exceptional treatment can be shown to be required in the national interest.  These exceptional increases should be kept to a minimum, bearing in mind that they will need 45to be balanced by lower than average increases to other groups ifthe increase in wages and salaries over the economy as a whole isto be kept within the norm.15. Exceptional pay increases should be confined to the followingcircumstances: 50(i) where the employees concerned, for example by acceptingmore exacting work or a major change in working practices,
make a direct contribution towards increasing productivity Sch. in the particular firm or industry. Even in such casessome of the benefit should accrue to the oommunity as awhole in the form of lower prices ;5 (ii) where it is essential in the national interest to secure achange in the distribution of manpower (or to prevent achange which would otherwise take place) and a pay increase would be both necessary and effective for thispurpose ;10 (iii) where there is general recognition that existing wage and salary levels are too low to maintain a reasonable standardof living;(iv) where there is widespread recognition that the pay of acertain group of workers has fallen seriously out of line15 with the level of remuneration for similar work and needs in the national interest to be improved.//Other incomes16. Some types of incomes, for example those of farmers andlandlords, are to a considerable extent determined by Government20 policy. The Government will, in accordance with its general objec-tive of price stability, have regard to the fact that increases in incomes of this type have an effect on the prices of goods and services. The income of nationalised industries, local authorities,etc. accrues directly to the community, but this does not mean that25 the prices charged by such undertakings should not be susceptible to the general considerations outlined above. The incomes of self-employed persons are an important category of personal incomes.They differ from those of employees in some respects, and allowancemust be made for these differences.   Nevertheless, those who are30 responsible for determining or are capable of influencing the incomes of self-employed persons should be guided by the considerationsrelating to the settlement of incomes and, where appropriate, to the criteria for price behaviour. Increases in these incomes may there-fore be referred to the National Board.   The other main category35 of non-employment incomes is profits, a part of whioh is distributed in the form of personal income to shareholders. An effective policy for avoiding price increases and securing price reductions wherever possible should ensure that increases in profits arise from increased efficiency.   Where the growth of profits or dividends is based on40 excessive market power this could indicate scope for price reductionsand such cases would be referred to the National Board for prices and Incomes for examination.General considerations17. The requirement that total money incomes should rise in line45 with the growth of real national output does not mean that all formsof income should increase at the same rate. It is necessary not onlyto create the conditions in which essential structural readjustmentscan be carried out smoothly but also to promote social justice. Thegeneral review of money incomes of all kinds to be carried out by50 the National Economic Development Council will involve not onlythe assembly of the facts about the movement of the main categories
Sch. 2 of income wages, salaries, income from self-employment, profits(distributed and undistributed) and rent but also an appraisal ofthe way the distribution of the national income is developing underthe impact of the prices and incomes policy. The Government havepledged themselves to use their fiscal powers or other appropriate 5means to correct any excessive growth in aggregate profits as com-pared with the growth of total wages and salaries, after allowing for short-term fluctuations.Sections 8(2) SCHEDULE 3and 22.Exclusion from ss. 6 and 7 of Prices and Charges      10Regulated under other Enactments1.
