CONFIDENTIAL L * a*     3 9 dJh13 document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government)c(66) 95 copy no.     6729th June, 1966cabinetTHE HOUSING PROGRAMME AND PUBLIC EXPENDITUREMgmorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer ought to tell my colleagues that the 1966 Public Expenditure Survey,which has just been completed, reveals a difficult position on public expenditure as a whole.    Substantial overspending of the amounts approved by the Cabinetlast July for 1969/70 is in prospect, yet the outlook for the growth of the economy is less favourable.    And there is an acute difficulty in 1967/68, whenthe increase in expenditure, in real terms, over 1966/67 is put at 6.9 per cent,exclusive of Selective Employment Tax payments and investment grants.This is on basic programmes only, strictly defined, and excludes, for example,the cost of further improvement in the standard of local authority housing.2.       I shall be shortly asking my colleagues to consider the implications ofthis and will circulate a paper in the near future.3.       In the meantime, I think it would be wrong to take an immediate decision (which it is anyway not intended to announce) on the addition of afurther 7, 500 approvals for non-priority areas to the local authority housing programme.    This would add  26 million to public expenditure, most of itin 1967/68.    I suggest a decision be deferred for the short period necessaryto enable us to look at the position as a whole, and the possible effect of it on other programmes.    Meanwhile the number of approvals already in the handsof local authorities, and not converted into starts, is at a very high level(91, 000 in May, compared with 75, 000 in May, 1965); and the number of approvalsissued out of the programme already agreed was 71, 000 in January-May, 1966compared with 80, 000 in January-May, 1965.4.      As regards the houses for transferred miners, it was the view of thePrime Minister&apos;s Committee on Housing (MIS.C 113) that these should beincluded in, and not additional to, the local authorities housing programme forthe two years 1966 and 1967.    It is entirely reasonable that this programme should provide for transferred workers and indeed 7,500 houses fortransferred miners have been provided within the programme over the years1962-65.    The present Coal Board requirement ought surely to take priority over the programmes of some of the non-priority authorities.    If 7,100 houses for England and 1, 900 for Wales were treated as a net addition to theprogramme, this would add some  31 million to public expenditure, of which more than half would be an addition to the problem in 1967/68.l. j, g.T rea sury Chambe r s, 3.
