-iis DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;? GOVERNMENT)C(66) 75 COPY NO.        8 78th June, 1966CABINETEUROPEAN LAUNCHER DEVELOPMENT organisation memorandum by the Minister of AviationSince our aide-memoire was delivered to our European partnerson 3rd June announcing our decision to terminate our financial commit-ment to the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO), thelegal implications of this decision have been challenged.     The Attorney-Generals advice is set out in Annex A to this paper;    this seems to meto introduce a new factor v/hich needs further consideration.In considering the advice of the Attorney-General, ray colleagues will wish to take into account the following factors:-Financial Liability for the Initial programme .       As. was shown in Annex A to C(66) 73, v/hen we decided to terminate our financial commitment to ELDO we assumed that the initial programme would cost  158 million and of this sum about halfhad been spent and three-quarters ( 120 million) committed.     On thelegal advice on which we were then working we believed that the maximumliability that would be incurred by the United Kingdom if we withdrewwould amount to  15. 5 million, i. e. 38. 8 per cent of the  40 millioncommitted but not yet spent (not  14, 5 million as given on page 2 of annex A).    In the light of the advice of the Attorney-General there isa serious risk that we might be required to pay substantially more.3.       If our ELDO partners insist that the question of Her Majesty&apos;governments liability to contribute to the cost of the complete initialprogramme ( 158 million) should be referred to arbitration and we lose,then there is a risk, as the Attorney-General points out, that we wouldhave to pay much more.    It is difficult to predict how much.    Ourminimum additional liability might well be assessed as the amount ofour percentage contribution in respect of the uncommitted part( 38 million) of the initial programme i, e. an additional  14,7 millionmaking a total liability of  30, 2 million.4,       If however other member States were unable to continue the initial programme without us and consequential damages were alsoawarded against us on this account, we might be expected to pay someof the expenses already incurred by other member States in respect ofthe programme.     The total contributions from other countries amountto as much as  50 million (i. e, the  80 million already spent minusthe United Kingdom share of this expenditure);   an arbitration awardmight well charge a subs tan ti&amp;&amp; portion of this sum to us.-1-
At least if the Organisation and the programmes areabandoned as a result of our unilateral decision not to continue our commitments, we should be called upon to meet a 30. 8 per centshare of cancellation, compensation, redundancy, etc. charges.No doubt it will be argued that we should meet these in full.    It isimpossible to quantify the amount of cancellation charges whichcould be in total between  20 million and  5 0 million.    In this event also there is a probable claim for the consequential damagesto which the Attorney-General refers i. e. for frustrated expenditure.It must be remembered that Article 25 of the Convention appointsFrance to be the liquidator in the event of an agreed dissolution ofthe Organisation.Cost of the ELDO A/PAS Programmes5.       The alternative to accepting these risks is to continue withELDO A and agree to the modification or new programme of ELDOPAS.     The PAS programme is an additional programme for which no country has accepted any financial commitment so far.     The costof this programme including contingencies, is estimated by theMinistry of Aviation at  67. 5 million.If we can persuade our European partners to reduce our con-tribution to the total programme from 1st January, 1967, to 25 per cent the amount we should have to pay tov/ards the cost of completion of the initial ELDO A and the additional PAS programme would be about  42million, i. e, 38. 8 per cent of the  40 million remaining to be spent thisyear on initial EIDO A plus 25 per cent of the remaining cost of the initial programme and the PAS programme.Comparative Costs6.       The cost to the United Kingdom of the ELDO A/ELDO PASprogrammes of  42 million, provided our European partners agree toour paying a revised contribution of 25 per cent from 1st January, 1967,needs to be considered against the probable claim that we pay our shareat 38. 8 per cent for the completion of the initial programme - :130million (paragraph 3 above).    If we went ahead with ELDO A/PASprogrammes (the only basis on which we can get a reduced contribution and retain goodwill) the net additional average cost to the United Kingdomv/ould, over the six years of the programme, be  2 million per annum. &apos;But if, as the Attorney -General fears, further claims for damages were awarded against us (paragraph 4 above), these might well result in our having to pay in total more than the cost of our going ahead withEIDO A/PAS programmes.7.       It is for these reasons that I feel that, before leaving forresumed discussions with our ELDO partners tomorrow, I should have further guidance from my colleagues.,    F.M.Ministry of Aviation, S. W. 1,8th June, 1966S EC RET
SEGRET280ANNEX AThere are serious legal implication involved in theGovernments decision to terminate unilaterally our financial commitment to EL.DO.2.      Under Article 23 of the Convention, withdrawal from ELDO ispossible only after the Convention has been in force for five years from the date (29th February, 1964) on which it entered into force.The right of withdrawal is, however, also subject to the proviso that&quot;a Member State may not withdraw from the Organis ation before theend ox any programme in which it has agreed to participate&quot;(Article 23(2)).    Article 4(1) provides that every State party to theConvention &quot;shall participate in the initial programme described inArticle 16&quot;.    It therefore appears that the United Kingdom has no right to withdraw from EJLDO until the end of the initial programme.The question at issue is whether we have any financial commitmentover and above our share of the  120 million ceiling already agreed by the Council&apos;s resolution of 22nd December, 1965.3.      The legal case for arguing that we have no such commitmentrests mainly on Article 4(5) of the Financial Protocol annexed to theConvention and on Article 14(3)(d)(ii) of the Convention.    Article 4(5)states that &quot;The commitments undertaken by Member States are calculated on the basis of an estimate of  70 million&quot; and goes on toprovide that &quot;should it appear that, in spite of this, the estimate islia-ble to be exceeded, the Member States will consult with one anotheron the decision to be taken&quot;.    It is our contention that the ceiling of 70 million could only be raised after consultation between the Statesparties to the Convention and in accordance with such decisions as theymay take in relation to the budget or otherwise as a result of suchconsultations.    Two such consultations took place in accordance withthis procedure in 1965 as a result of which unanimous agreement wasreached to raise the ceiling in the first instance up to approximately 92 million and later, by the Resolution of 22nd December, 1965, up to 120 million.    It is also relevant that under the terms of theConvention all expenditure by the Organisation is subject to approval bythe Council by the adoption of the annual budget or of a supplementaryor revised budget or in exceptional circumstances by a Resolution in anticipation of provision in the budget (Articles 1 and 2 of theFinancial Protocol).    Under Article 14(3)(d)(ii) of the Convention theadoption of the annual budget of the Organisation for the initialprogramme requires a decision of the Council taken by &quot;a specialtwo-thirds majority of all Member States including the concurringvotes of Member States whose contributions amount to at least85 per cent of the contributions made to the Organisation&quot;,    The samevoting provisions presumably apply to any modification of the annualbudget by means of a supplementary or revised budget.    It follows that no expenditure exceeding the ceiling of  120 million can beauthorised except in accordance with these provisions and no Memberis obligated to contribute a share of such expenditure until thenecessary budgetary decisions have been taken by the requisitevoting majority.
4.      Against this statement of the legal position it may be argued that Articles 4(1) and 23(2) of the Convention read togetherclearly contemplate the completion of the initial programme and article 4(2) of the Financial Protocol lays down a scale of contributions for this purpose; this scale is described in the Annex to the FinancialProtocol as &quot;Scale to serve as a basis for the assessment ofcontributions during the period of the initial programme of theOrganisation&quot;.     Therefore, failing any different decision taken byMember States as a result of Article 4(5) this arrangement mustprevail to enable the initial programme to be completed.    It would be pointed out that the ceiling of  70 million mentioned in Article 22(3)was only an estimate and it was always in contemplation of theparties that the completion of the initial programme might cost more.The proponents of this view will argue  that for the United Kingdom to block the completion of the initial programme by the use ofArticle 14(3)(d)(ii) would be an abuse of right and contrary to the clearintention of the parties to complete the initial programme whatever thecost.    A further point that would undoubtedly be made against us, if wepersist in our unilateral decision to terminate our financial commitment,is that we are in breach of our obligation under Article 4(5) to consult with other member states on the decision to be taken.5.     In support of the interpretation of the Convention outlined inthe preceding paragraph Mr. Bourely, the Legal Adviser to ELDO,has referred to the record of the proceedings of the Lancaster HouseConference preparatory to the drafting of the Convention, which inhis view, established clearly &quot;that the consultations under Article 4(5)of the Financial Protocol were only agreed to by certain States(notably the United Kingdom) on the clear proviso that an overspendof the estimate, incidentally accepted as liable to occur, should notfurnish grounds for calling the initial programme into question, andthat all Member States should be under obligation to bear a share ofthe additional costs. &quot;    It is, I understand, accepted as a principleof interpretation of international treaties that recourse may be had tothe trayaux preparatoires for the purpose of clarifying an ambiguityor obscurity in the text.    In my view this is a case in v/hich the termsof the Convention are obscure.    Unhappily the travaux preparatoireswere not brought to my notice on the only occasion on v/hich I have beenasked to consider this matter, namely in February, 1966.    Examinationof the records of the Lancaster House Conference confronts us with thefact that the United Kingdom Delegate pressed hard for the adoption ofthe principle that all Member States were under an obligation to share in the total cost of the initial programme whether it proved to bemore or less than  70 million.    There was opposition to this from some other delegations and a discussion ensued which resulted in theadoption of Article 4(5).    This provision was by way of a compromise which unfortunately still left the position obscure with the advocates ofboth points of view apparently ma.intaining their opposed positions.In these circumstances, it will, I think, be difficult for us now to takethe contrary position to that which we strenuously took in thediscussions in 1961 and an international tribunal would not, I think,be at all sympathetic to such a change of front.-4-
6.     I understand that it is now proposed to supplement the&quot;initial programme&quot; in its original form by the addition to thelauncher of Apogee and Perigee motors.    I understand that i.t is agreed that this addition would in effect amount to a &quot;furtherprogramme&quot; to which we are not committed;  but in my opinion thiswould not affect our financial liability to contribute towards theoriginal ELDO A programme,7.     In my view if the question of Her Majesty&apos;s Government^liability to contribute in the costs of the initial programme up to its completion were to be referred to arbitration under Article 22 of theConvention, there is a serious risk that we should lose.    If we lost,damages would be awarded against us by the arbitral tribunal.    It isdifficult to predict what the measure and amount of damages would be.They might be assessed as the amount of our percentage contribution in respect of the remainder of the initial programme.    But if theother Member States were unable to continue the initial programme without us, the damages awarded could well be in excess of the costof our continued participation in the initial programme up to its completion.E.
