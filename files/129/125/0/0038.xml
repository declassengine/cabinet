IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT)C(66) 8827th June, 1966COPY NO.CABINETTHE CONCORD PROJECTMemorandum by the Minister of AviationIntroductionImmediately on taking office we carried out an urgent reviewof the Concord project.    After considering the legal and practicalconsequences of our abandoning the project unilaterally, we eventuallydecided to go ahead with the development and my predecessor made astatement to this effect in the House on 20th January, 1965.    A copyof this statement is at Annex A.2.     The practical consequences of withdrawing seem certainly no less difficult than they were 18 months ago.    I have however asked the Attorney-General to confirm whether his view of the legal positionremains as stated in November, 1964 (E. D. (64) 23).    The Attorney-General is now reviewing the position and will circulate his opinon as soon as possible.3.     We have so far spent about  40 million on this project, and weare now at the point where we must extend our commitment very considerably if we are to continue to keep to the programme and maintain our vitally important lead over the rival American aircraft.The British and French officials concerned are seeking, in their&quot;Report at Annex B, our authority to embark on the remainder of thedevelopment programme up to certification of airworthiness.    If we agree, we shall very rapidly become committed to spending a further 145 million.4.     Monsieur Pisani, the French Minister mainly concerned, hastold me that the French Government remain entirely committed to the project, that they would view very gravely any delays to a programme on which their technology, prestige and budget policy are all staked,and that they wish to proceed as the officials have recommended.Although the French Government have indicated great concern at the rising financial commitments, he told me that they have already agreedto go ahead and will only reconsider the matter if new technical or commercial factors arise.    I am convinced1 that unless we are able totell the French Government by the date of the French Prime Minister lsvisit on 6th/7th July that we also intend to proceed, we shall be in anacutely embarrassing position.-1-
Costs5.     In 1962, when the agreement with the French committing us toConcord was signed, it was thought that, the British share of the costof development up to certification of airworthiness might be about 80 million.    (This being half the total, since the whole project isbased on the principle of 50/50 sharing with the French. )   By 1964,this had risen to   140 million, which was the figure we had before us when we took office.    Even then, as my predecessor remarked in theHouse on 5th November, 1964, it was recognised that there was &apos;agreat possibility of even this very high level of costs spiralling stillfurther1.        This has indeed occurred.    The estimate now stands at 185 million.    After adding a further  40 million for developmentafter certification of airworthiness and additional contingencies of 25 million we now arrive at a total of  25 0 million.6.     These increases are attributable in part to material and wage increases and to design changes which will give us a somewhat biggerand better aircraft, but the plain fact is that the costs of developmentwere considerable under-estimated.    Further escalation is stillpossible but I believe that the current estimates are much moresoundly based than the earlier ones.    They also contain substantialcontingencies.7.      Originally, it was thought that the aircraft would sell at from 3 million to  4 million each, (including a  1 million levy for recovery of development expenditure).     By 1964, this had risen to  5 million.It is now about   6. 5 million, with the amount included for levy havingbeen reduced to an extremely low level (a eliding side of 4-10 per centbut we cannot be sure the market will bear even this).    The prospects of any substantial recovery of development expenditure by means of alevy on sales are thus now extremely poor.8.      The original intention was that while development would be financed by Governments, production wotdd be financed by industry.It is now clear that the contractors will require that the Governmentshould either lend directly or underwrite the loan of the working capitalwhich will be required to finance production.    This is a point to beconsidered in relation to plans for a Government holding in the aircraft industry and in BAG in particular.    It is estimated that the sums involved will reach a maximum of  75 -  110 million in each countryaround 1972-73.    If we continue with the project, the Exchequer will therefore be at risk for very large sums over a period of several years.     (A summary of the costs involved and the years in which theywill fall is at Annex C. ).Technical progress9.     Technical progress with Concord so far has been encouraging.Construction of the two prototype aircraft required for the develop-ment programme is well under way, and they are due to fly in 1968.Several major technical problems have been encountered, but havebeen successfully overcome.    In order to obtain the requiredperformance, certain further relatively small changes need to bemade in the design for the production aircraft, in particular to the-2-COMFSDEWTIAL
wing tips - but officials are confident that this can be done withoutdelay to the programme.    The technical advice from my Departmentindicates that the aircraft1 s planned performance will be achieved,that there will be no unusual difficulties in obtaining certification of airworthiness, and that there is a good prospect of its being ready for delivery to the airlines before the end of 1971.    There is a similardegree of confidence on the French side.10.     Concord, both in respect of design work and production, is ofdecisive importance for the future of the aircraft industry.    ?/ithoutit, the industry would be not far from the situation described in the plowden Report as &quot;a cumulative decline which might sweep theindustry right down, past a level at which it might otherwiseconsolidate&quot;.    Concord also occupies a key place in our policy ofbasing the industry&apos;s future on partnership with France.    It isfurthermore the one major technological endeavour in which we havea considerable lead over the Americans and, apart from the serious effect on our aircraft industry, our withdrawal would be taken as a demonstration of our inability to meet technological challenge.Operating economics11.     It is estimated that ConcordIs operating cost per seat/mile onthe North Atlantic will, once the aircraft has the uprated enginesplanned for it some two years after its first entry into service, beabout 25 per cent greater than the cost offered by the most economicof present-day jet aircraft, and there will be less revenue because oflack of space for cargo.    The &apos;very large oubeonic jets&apos; which may bein service in the 1970s will probably increase this differential to30-35 per cent.    However, Concord should have a high appeal  for passengers which should result in higher load-factors off-setting tosome extent its higher operating costs per seat/mile.    The world&apos;sairlines will probably also agree, anyhow at first, to some form offare differential between supersonic and subsonic aircraft whichwould take account of their differing appeal and operating economicsand thus enable both to be operated with approximately equalprofitability.The market for Concord12.     The general consensus of opinion on both sides of the Atlanticis that by 1980 there should be a market for some 300 to 4-00 supersonic transport aircraft.     British and French officials consider that, if allgoes well, Concord should capture 150 or more of this market.(This, v/e understand, is also Lockheeds assessment. )    Sales of suchnumbers with supporting spares, would have a highly beneficial effecton our balance of payments.    But the number likely to be sold is very uncertain.    Many factors contribute to this uncertainty but the problemof the sonic bang deserves special mention.713.     The intensity of the sonic bang which will be produced bysupersonic transport aircraft can be predicted and measuredscientifically with a fair degree of accuracy.    What is uncertain isthe level or the frequency at which sonic bangs would becomeintolerable for a significant proportion of the population, and whetherthey would become more tolerable when they were more familiar.
It is impossible to predict how Governments around the world would react to regular airline operations at supersonic speeds and whatrestrictions might be imposed in consequence.    Some restrictionsare inevitable, but the severity of the restrictions will determineboth the aircraft&apos;s operating economics and its prospects of sales.14.     Eight Concords have been reserved for BOAC and eight forAir France.    Other airlines (including most of the leading Americanones) have put down the fairly modest sums required to assure them ofa total of a further 36 places in the queue,    BOAC, whileco-operating fully in the project as regards technical matters, haveotherwise sought to safeguard their negotiating position by appearingas uncommitted observers.    This is understandable; Concord offersBOAC the opportunity of remaining in the forefront of aviation, but atthe risk of come financial difficulties.Sonic Tests15.     In view of the extent to which the success of the Concord maydepend upon public acceptance of sonic bangs, it is desirable to initiate soon large scale tests to determine public reaction.    I am advised legislation is necessary and I propose shortly to submit proposals, for legislation to enable ouch tests to be carried out.Such tests have been held in the United States but not on a sufficientbasis in France so far.Summary16.     (a)   It is now estimated that it may cost the United Kingdom 25 0 million to develop Concord.    The prospects of a financial return on this investment through a levy on salesare very poor.(b) There are solid grounds for confidence that technicallyConcord will be a success.(c) There is great uncertainty about the numbers of aircraftlikely to be sold.    But if we were able to sell substantial numbers, there would be very large benefits to our balance of payments.(d) The project, both in respect of design work and inrespect of future production work, is of decisiveimportance for the future of the aircraft industry andhas value for advanced technology.(e) The French will undoubtedly resist strongly any further attempt on our part to withdraw from the project.    Thepractical and political consequences of unilateralwithdrawal would, if anything, be.more difficult now than they were 18 months ago.7(f) It is desirable to initiate soon large scale tests todetermine public reaction to sonic bangs.(g) There are gains and losses for the national economy to be considered whether we continue with this projector abandon it.-4-
R e c omm endations17.     In my view, we have no alternative but to continue withConcord, given the French attitude and the legal and political consequences which flow from it.    I, therefore, now seek approval to -authorise the remainder of the development programme up tocertification of airworthiness involving expenditure of a further  145 million over the next 5 years, and for acceptance of theprinciple that the Government should either lend directly or under-write the working capital required to finance production.F.M.Ministry of Aviation, S.

ANNEX BCONCORD 161 of 13th May, 1966REPORT OF THE ANGLO/FRENCH COMMITTEE of officials CHARGED V/ITH THE SUPERVISION OFTHE CONCORD PROJECT1.     Since the Report of the Committee of Officials dated        j14th May, 1964 satisfactory progress has been made in the design and construction of the Concerd supersonic civil transport aircraft.In July, 1965 it was decided to improve the design andarrangement of the fuselage so as to increase its capacity and to incorporate fchese improvements in the two pre-production aircraft.Construction of major components of the two prototype aircraft is well advanced and assembly of the first prototype has just begun atToulouse.Bench testing of the Olympus 593 engines started slightly inadvance of the planned date and encouraging results have already beenobtained.2.     All the progress accomplished during these past two yearsrelates to the long-range version which was the subject of the optionstaken out by the airlines.    Design of a medium-range version with increased capacity has been postponed indefinitely and both pre-production aircraft v?ill be of the long-range version.    The present report thereforedeals only with the programme for the long-range version.3.     The next phase of the development programme involves theconstruction of an airframe for static test, two pre-production aircraft,and an airframe for fatigue test.The definition of these test airframes and of the pre-production aircraft has been the subject of an agreement between the Committee of officials and the Committee of Directors.    This does not mean that allthe technical uncertainties have disappeared, but the difficulties which remain are limited and must be considered normal at the present stage ofthe project.4.     The first flight remains planned for the beginning of 1968 andcertification of airworthiness for the summer of 1971,5. &apos;   The target payload for the production aircraft on the Paris-New Yorkstage remains at 20, 000 lb. (100 passeagers) with Stage O engines and25,000 lb. (125 passengers) with Stage 1 engines in critical summerconditions, with a full seating capacity of about 136 passengers in normalconditions.Both the Committee of Officials and the Committee of Directorsconsider that Concord will be capable of this performance.    However, the officials&apos; more severe estimates lead them to believe that an appreciablyhigher take-off weight may be required than the firm say is necessary.Some relatively small changes in design, particularly to the wing*tips,will enable these two points of view to be reconciled.-7-COMFJBEMTIAt
6.     As a result of a detailed examination of the firms? proposals by-officials of the two countries, the Committee of Officials are able tosubmit to the two Governments the following conclusions concerning theproduction aircraft which are expected to enter service in the autumn of1971.- The engines will be Olympus type 593 Stage O.They will reach Stage 1 characterised by an additional thrustof about 10 per cent at the latest two years after entry into service.- The Concord production aircraft will in fact be capable ofcarrying the target payload mentioned in paragraph 5.- The total operating cost per seat/km on the North Atlantic fora Concord aircraft with Stage 1 engines and arranged for touristclass will be about 25 per cent greater than the seat/km costoffered by the best of present jet aircraft (Boeing 707/320B)used in tourist class.    As regards large subsonic aircraft suchas the Boeing 747 which may enter service in the 1970&apos;s andwhich v/ill offer even lower operating costs, the differentialcould reach 30-35 per cent. 1The passenger appeal of Concord is expected to result in theaircraft being better filled and this would offset to some extent the effect of the higher operating costs per seat/km.- As an indication of what passengers are prepared to pay overand above the basic fare, it may be noted that, on theNorth Atlantic, and depending on the seasonal variation of the tourist fare, the first class fare is from 45 per cent to75 per cent higher.    On the other hand, it is thought that faresmay fall by at least 10 per cent in the 1970&apos;s,- The market for supersonic civil transport aircraft in the 1970&apos;sis variously estimated at between 300 and 400 aircraft.The Committee considers that if all goes well, Concord shouldachieve sales of 150 or more aircraft.Airport noise and sonic bang still present problems.    At take-off and landing, fly-over noise should remain within the limits at presenttolerated, but the level of lateral noise on take-off currently expected isstill a cause for some concern.    In the absence of further publicexperiments, it is still not possible to give precise indications of therestrictions due to sonic bang.    If these were severe routeing would beaffected and the market reduced accordingly.7.     The costs corresponding to the realisation of this programme upto the entry into service of the aircraft with Stage 1 engine (i. e. up to 1973)have been estimated by the contractors at  390 million in the economicconditions of July, 1965*.*Exclusive of tax on the French side.-0-
However, officials think that certain costs have beenunder-estimated and have made their own evaluation of the cost of theprogramme, allowing for contingencies.    Having regard to the fact thatimproved cost-control methods have been introduced at the firms and that negotiations have been started for the early introduction of incentivecontracts on as wide a basis as possible in both countries, they believethat it should be possible to contain the total cost of the programmewithin an upper limit of  500 million.8.     The number of options taken out for production Concords has reached 50 and new options are being discussed.    Nevertheless, in viewof the novelty and complexity of the problem posed, the exercising of the options cannot be expected until six months after the flight of theprototypes and it therefore does not seem reasonable to foresee the airlines signing firm contracts before the autumn of 1968.The attention of the Governments is drawn to the special positionof BOAC and Air France for whom production aircraft have been reservedwithout their having paid the sums (albeit almost nominal) which all otherairlines have had to pay.9.     The coots of manufacture of production aircraft and of spares willgive rise to a significant net outlay in advance of sales, which will beginas from 1967 and reach a maximum towards 1972/1973 of about 75 million -  110 million in each of the two countries.    The twoadministrations are discussing with the firms the methods of financingwhich could be utilised to resolve this problem, the solution of which isessential for the continuance of the programme.10.     Adherence to the timeocale of the Concord programme is judged tobe essential to preserve its chances of success vis-a-vis the Americansupersonic transport programme, under which, in so far as can be judged,entry into service is not planned until 1975.    As has been said, the concord timescale has been adhered to as regards the protopypes.    Thefollowing stage, which must follow on immediately is the launching of thepre-production aircraft which will require substantial aums of money forwhich it is necessary first to have the approval of the Governments.    TheCommittee of Officials hope to be able to communicate this decision to theCommittee of Directors by the end of June, 1966.11.      The Committee of Officials considers that the programme definedabove can be carried to a successful conclusion and that it should result inthe Concord being sold in quantity to the world&apos;s airlines.    They therefore recommend to the two Governments that the programme be continued.on behalf of theCommittee of OfficialsChairman.Vice- Chairman
