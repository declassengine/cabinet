THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 539th March. 1966CABINETFARM PRICE review memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and FoodSince I circulated my memorandum (C(66) 51) of 4th Marchthere has undoubtedly been the eleventh hour change of heart by theUnions, the possibility of which I mentioned. i2.       They have made a number of approaches, in the latest ofwhich they have reduced their bid to some  31 million.    On the beef/milk complex their proposals are virtually identical with those in our 20 million schedule.3.       This dramatic reduction of their demands is accompanied by a request that the Government should give a number of assurances alldesigned to reduce the stop-go element in Annual Reviews.    TheirIdeas, as put forward, go too far, but there is a good deal to be said for the general idea.4.       Unless there are further developments before our discussion in cabinet, I would not want to vary my proposal to end up with a disagreedReview at  20 million.    The Secretary of State for Scotland and I arekeen, however, that, in the White Paper announcing our decisions, weshould include a paragraph to the effect that the Government would be willing after the Review to discuss with the industry the provision ofassurances to provide for greater stability in the level of support overthe period of the Plan.66COPY NO.T F ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, S.
