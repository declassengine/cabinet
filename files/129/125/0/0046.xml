CONFIDENTIAL ,        397rHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 96 COPY NO.    674th July, 1966CABINETTHE APPOINTMENT OF JUSTICES OF THE PEACE INENGLAND AND wales memorandum by the Lord chancellor the Cabinet at their meeting on 9th December, 1965,(CC(65) 69th Conclusions, Minute 5) invited me &quot;to bring before them indue course proposals for improving the arrangements for selectingJustices of the Peace in England and Wales&quot;.    I am now in a position todo this.    My proposals were considered by the Home Affairs committee at their meeting on the 24th June (H(66) 14th Meeting, Minute 3) and theywere in favour of them, subject to certain minor qualifications. ,2,       This subject has given rise to considerable and continualcontroversy for 135 years and has already resulted in two royal commissions,    This memorandum begins with a review of these yearsand of the recommendations of the Royal Commissions.    It goes on to describe the present position and its defects, and concludes with asummary of my proposals for dealing with the problem once and for all.HistoricalIi3.      For many years from 1830 there was considerable complaint bythe Whigs that Tory Governments always appointed Tory Justices and bythe Tories that Whig Governments always appointed Whig Justices.4.       By the end of the century the complaint was mainly that of the liberals that the Conservatives appointed too many ConservativeJustices.    It was also complained that Church of England Justices were appointed to the exclusion of Catholic and Non-Conformist Justices.5.      After the Liberal landslide in 1906 the Government abolishedthe property qualification for Justices and in 1910 appointed a RoyalCommission &quot;to consider and report whether any and what steps shouldbe taken to facilitate the selection of the most suitable persons to beJustices of the Peace irrespective of creed and political opinion&quot;.    TheCommission included   Mr. John Simon and Mr. Arthur Henderson andit reported in 1911 (Cmd. 5250).\ I6.       Since 1536 Justices of the Peace in England and &quot;Wales have beenappointed by the Crown on the advice of the Lord Chancellor (except inLancashire where they are appointed on the advice of the Chancellor ofthe Duchy).    In 1906 the Lord Chancellor acted in nearly all cases onthe advice of the Lords Lieutenant.-1-CQMFSDENT5AL
7.       I arn going tc quote fairly extensively from the Report of the RoyalCommission of 1910-11 as it seems to me that their views are just asapposite today as they were more than half a century ago.In their Report they said:-&quot;Speaking very generally we in the first place express the opinionthat the evils now existing in the system of selecting justices of the Peace can, to a great extent, be remedied by removingpolitical opinions and political action from the influencesaffecting such selection.The substitute for such political opinion and influences should befound in the fitness of the intended Justices, and such fitnessshould be constituted by their moral and personal character,their general ability, business habits, independence of judgment,and common sense.The voluntary system, no doubt excludes the existence of a highjudicial standard;  but such standard may find some equivalentif only men of high character and intelligence be appointed to actas Justices,Political zeal and decided political convictions in no way representsuch equivalent standard.We therefore express the confident view that political opinion or political services should not be regarded as in any way con-trolling or influencing the appointment of Justices.     The manmost fitted to discharge the duties of the office should beappointed.     The declaration contained in the Statute of Henry Vshould still prevail:   Justices of the Peace must be residentsin their several counties, &apos;of the best reputation, and mostworthy men in the county&apos;.We seek to enforce these views by recording an opinion, formedafter full inquiry, that appointments influenced by considerations of political opinion and services are highly detrimental to public interests, and tend to lower the authority of theMagisterial Benches in the country.We have shown how necessary it is to consider the qualities whichrender a person suitable to be a Justice of the Peace, and wehave already referred to the important judicial andadministrative duties which the holders of the office are calledupon to discharge.    We have also expressed the opinion that inview of these duties it is necessary that Justices should be menof sufficient ability, of impartial and independent judgment, andof high personal character.    But it is also in the public interest that they should be men who command general confidence.And for this reason also it is desirable that the area of selec-tion should be wide, and the choice comprehensive, so that the bench may include men of all social classes and of all shades of creed and political opinion.
The removal of the property qualification for County Justicesby the Act of 1906 has of course materially enlarged the field of selection.    Under the operation of this Act members of ailclasses are eligible for approximately^ointment, and we concur in the view which has been presented to us very forcibly that it is in thepublic interest that working men with a first-hand knowledge ofthe conditions of life among their own class should be appointedto the County as well as to the Borough Benches&quot;.8.       The Royal Commission recommended that Justices of the Feaceshould continue to be appointed to the bench on the recommendation of theliord Chancellor, who, as Head of the Judiciary, ought to remain theMinister responsible for their selection and discipline.     they recommended too that the lords lieutenant of Counties should retain their functions of making recommendations for appointment to the LordChancellor, but that they should be assisted by small advisorycommittees appointed by the Lord Chancellor and acting in accordancewith practice and procedure approved by him.    The Lord chancellor was to appoint similar committees for the Boroughs.9.       Thus it was that the present system of advisory committee came into being, though the first committees were not actually appointeduntil 1912. 110.       The Royal Commission went on to express themselves, in definite and forthright terms, on the high importance of keeping politics out ofthe appointment of Justices and as to the qualities which must be sought in men and women to be appointed to the Bench.    I think it well wormwhile setting out their views verbatim:-&quot;We are of the opinion that it is not in the public interest that thereshould be an undue preponderance of Justices drawn from onepolitical party.We strongly condemn the influence and action of politicians being allowed to secure appointments on behalf of any political party.We submit to the Lord Chancellor for the time being that he oughtto reject and repudiate any such influence, and we equally urge that Lords Lieutenant and anyone recommending persons for appointment as Justices should decline to recognise political orreligious opinions as any ground of qualification or disqualifica-tion.We also submit that the Lord Chancellor and the Lords Lieutenantshould refuse to receive any unasked-for recommendations for appointment from Members of Parliament or candidates forsuch membership in their own constituencies, or from political agents or representatives of political associations.In view of the important judicial and administrative duties whichJustices of the Peace are called upon to discharge, it isnecessary that persons appointed to the office should be menof moral and good personal character, general ability, businesshabits, independent judgment, and common sense.-3-
It is in the public interest that persons of every social grade shouldbe appointed Justices of the Peace, and that working men with a first-hand knowledge of the conditions of life among their ownclass should be appointed to the County as v/ell as to the BoroughBenches.The appointment of every Justice should be accompanied by a formal undertaking on his part to fulfil his fair share ofmagisterial duties and in the absence of any valid excuse forneglect to discharge such duties he should be called upon to resign his office, and if he refuses to resign he should beremoved from the Commission of the Peace,    But a requeston the part of a Justice who has changed his place of residenceout of the area of the Commission  or which he acts to betransferred to the Commission for the district in which the newresidence is situated should receive very favourable considera-tion.&quot;11,        Lastly, the Royal Commission recommended no change in thestatutory qualifications of Justices, nor did they recommend any changein the numbers or tenure of office of ex-cfficio Justices.12.       When the Labour Government v/as elected in 1945 there weresimilar complaints that an undue proportion of the Justices wereConservative or Liberal and the Labour Government appointed anotherRoyal Commission inter alia &quot;to review the present arrangements forthe selection and removal of Justices of the Peace in Great Britain, andto report what changes, if any, in that system are necessary or desirable to ensure that only the most suitable persons are appointedto the Commission of the Peace&quot;.13.       This Commission, v/hich included Mr. Dingle Foot, sat for twoyears and received 93 memoranda and heard 75 witnesses.    In theirReport (Cmd. 7463 of July, 1948) they confirmed the views of their predecessors that the Lord Chancellor (and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster) should retain their existing functions in regard to theappointment of Justices.     They thought that the Lord Chancellor^ staff for dealing with this section of his responsibilities was undergraded andinadequate;  they wished to see the advisory committee system retained,recommending that the committees should be small and constituted asfollows:&quot;The first aim should be to appoint as members of such committeesjudicially minded people who will recognise that the selection of men and women to sit in judgment on others is a highresponsibility, that their duty as members of an advisorycommittee is to find the men and women who are best qualified for this office, and that in mailing recommendations to theLord Chancellor they must subordinate to this ail other considerations.    Secondly, members of advisory committees should be drawn from different sections of the community, sothat as far as possible the advisory committee v/ill representa cross-section of society - the members being people who have such local knowledge and associations that they can provideor obtain the information which the committee requires toenable it to select from persons in various walks of life-4-
those men and women who are best fitted to be justices.Thirdly, the proportion of members of the committee who are appointed because of their affiliation with political parties should be restricted, so that their influence shall not bepredominant and that room may be found for other memberswhose interests and associations lie in other fields thanpolitical work.    Fourthly, if in any area it is found practicablewithout including persons chosen because of their&quot; affiliationwith political parties to constitute an effective committee whichwill have the requisite local knowledge and the requisiteimpartiality and freedom from political bias, the LordChancellor should feel free to appoint such a committee&quot;.14.       The loyal Commission recommended that advisory committees should be given general directions on the carrying out of their duties which should include the following:-(a) No member of the committee should regard himself as &apos;therepresentative1 of any political party, and that it is the duty of each and every member of the committee to be vigilant, to prevent therecommendation of any person for appointment or the exclusion of anyperson from appointment as a justice, on the sole ground that he is amember of a particular party.(b) Li appointing justices the paramount consideration is theperson&apos;s fitness for the discharge of judicial duties.(c) Care must be taken to see that there are persons in thecommission representative of various sections of the community,(d) If, after a preliminary selection has been made, it is found thata considerable majority of the proposed new justices are of one politicalfaith, the list should be revised with a view to seeing whether equallygood, or better, nominations can be made from among members ofother political parties.    If the answer is that they cannot, then theoriginal list should stand.15.       The Royal Commission further recommended that Chairmen ofCounty Councils and of Urban and Rural District Councils should cease to be Justices ex-officio.    The Mayor of a Borough should be a Justiceex-officio during his period of office but not as ex-Miayor, and hisrights to preside over the Justices shotild be curtailed.Current facts16.       There are 64 Commissions in the Counties and 129 in the Boroughsin England and Wales,    Apart from the Justices ex-officio, who numberabout 2, 300, there are some 10, 000 Justices cf whom about 15, 300 are on the Active List and the remaining 2, 700 on the Supplemental List,-5-
CONFIDENTIAL*     40217.       Sufficient information does not exist to admit of their classificationinto social groups but before the recent election the political affiliationof the Justices on the Active List was, so far as known, as follows:-	Con.	Lib.	Lab.	Not knownCounties	4, 729	1,124	3, 323	1, 886Boroughs	1, 632	519	1,458	598	6,411	1, 643	4, 786	2,464These figures are not accurate.     Over the years there has beena substantial shift to Labour but the figures represent the politicalopinions of the Justices when they were first appointed - in many cases30 years ago,18, The votes cast in Boroughs and Counties at the 1966 GeneralElection were, as far as i have been able to ascertain, as follows:-Con.              Lib. Lab.Counties                                   5,104, 079 1, 378, 904 5, 248,170Boroughs                                 4, 963,886       74-6,239 6,470,41810, 067,965 2,125,143 11,718,53819.       Notwithstanding the recommendations of the two Royal Commiss-ions, the average Advisory Committee has consisted of a Chairman andtwo Conservatives, two Labour and one liberal.    Nor have theex-officio Justices been abolished.Criticisms20.      The following criticisms are currently made of the existing system:(a) That, whereas in cur past history all judicial officers were atone time appointed on political grounds, today no attention is paid topolitics in appointing any other judicial officers (Judges, Recorders,Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen of Quarter Sessions and StipendiaryMagistrates who are all appointed on merit alone) and it is quite wrongthat any attention whatever should be paid to party politics in appointingjustices,(b) A complaint (which comes only from the Labour Party) that not enough attention is paid to party politics in appointing justices.(c) That the proportion of the population&apos; who take an active partin local party politics is very small and that this small class is greatlyover-represented on the Bench although --6-
-7-(i)   There is no reason to suppose that local party politicians are necessarily qualified to be good magistrates;  if they arc, theyshould be appointed on their merits like anyone else,(ii)   They are usually too busy to undergo courses of training.(iii) They are naturally unable to sit in any case in which the localauthority has an interest and such cases are frequent.(iv) Their Council and Committee meetings make it difficult for themto sit regularly,(d) That Justices have net sufficient knowledge of what they are doingand in particular that there is too great disparity in the sentences theyimpose.(e) That the ex-officio Justices ought to be abolished as recommendedby the Labour Government1 s Royal Commission because, as the CountyCouncils Association themselves said to the Commission:-&quot;The Association entertain no doubt that, if any approach is to bemade to the ideal that only the most suitable persons are appointed to the commission of the peace, then chairmen ofcounty, borough, urban and rural district councils should cease to qualify for admission to the list merely by their assumption of these offices.    The qualities which enable a chairman of alocal authority to perform his duties with success arc not of necessity those requisite for the office of justice of the peace,added to which there is the point that in many areas the officeof chairman is a matter of rotation rather than of distinctivemerit.    In any event, if a chairman of a local authority issuitable for appointment as a justice of the peace, the ordinaryprocedure should siiffice to ensure his consideration for that office&quot;.
My own conclusions21.     I have read not only the Reports but also all the evidence given before both Royal Commissions.22.     On the 28th February I had a meeting which I had called of allthe Chairmen and Secretaries of both County and Borough AdvisoryCommittees and 248 attended and we discussed the questions referredto above.    I have since received many letters from thern expressingadditional views.    These have raised a number of problems withwhich I need not trouble my colleagues such as the anonymity of advisory Committees, the method of selection of Chairmen of Benches,the minimum number of sitting days required of Justices, the holding of Regional Conferences of Chairmen of Advisory Committees, removalsfrom one district to another and whether prospective Justices should beinterviewed and, if so, by whom.23.     I have however come to a number of conclusions based on myobservations and experience both at the Bar and while I have held office as Lord Chancellor.    These conclusions are as follows:-(i) In recent years the functions of Justices of the Peace haveincreased  greatly   both in volume and in difficulty, and itis more necessary than ever that those who are appointedJustices should be well qualified to carry out this importantwork,(ii)  The paramount qualification for the office of Justice is that aperson should have a judicial temperament, possess morethan average intelligence, enjoy the respect and confidence ofthe community in which he lives and preferably have shown a desire for public service in some field.(iii) It is satisfactory that it is now generally accepted (a) that aman should not be appointed a Justice for services renderedin some other field and (b) that no attention should be paid towhat his religion is.(iv) It is important that Justices should be drawn from all socialclasses in the community so that whoever appears before aBench will probably have someone on it who is familiar withhis habits of thought and speech and his economic and living conditions.   Justices are not at present so representative andI think it important that steps should be taken to make them so.(v) Advisory Committees are confused as to whether theLord Chancellor wants them to concentrate on class or onparty politics.    No doubt at one time it was broadly the same thing, the propertied class being Conservative, the middleclass Liberal and the man in the cloth cap Labour.    Today the manual worker may well turn out to be a staunch conservative and the yoting electronic scientist Labour.-8-
I cannot help thinking myself that a spread of the social classesis much more important than any exact equilibrium betweenparty political affiliations.    Moreover, an excessiveproportion of local party politicians on a Bench gives theimpression that the Bench is substantially the perquisite ofthe political parties.There are, however, a number of difficulties in obtaining asufficient: spread of social classes because;-(a)   The lower income groups are much less inclined toundertake public work than they used to be (&quot;What do Iget out of it?&quot;).    According to a survey recently madein a representative large village, the percentage in income groups doing public work has been:Upper Middle Lower1955                         44. 0 24.5 31.51965                         34.5 38.5 27. 0% change                  -9.5 +14. 0 -4.5(b) It is not easy for the weekly wage earner to get thenecessary time off in a time of full employment.Employers need encouragement about this; and theGovernment and Nationalised Industries should set abetter example.    Civil Servants are usually not allowedmore than twelve days off a yea.r for public work andthe same rule is applied by the National Coal Board andby the Transport Commission.(c) The pecuniary loss may be too great.    Justices -shouldhave financial loss allowances, similar to those payable to local authority members.    The Home Affairs committee agreed that, pending consideration of the report of theIvlaud Committee on allowances for elected members oflocal authorities, Justices should be entitled to financial loss allowances on the basis applicable to members oflocal authorities, the problem of self-employed and othersnot reached by this allowance being considered inconjunction with the sirnila.r problems in the localgovernment field.(d) The three-mile limit for subsistence allowances is agreat handicap for Justices who are weekly wage earners.The Home Affairs Committee was disposed to agree tothe abolition of this limit provided that this could be doneon grounds special to Justices which would not affectsubsistence allowances generally.    Justices can in fact be distinguished from members of local government bodiesbecause the Courts cannot resume after the luncheona-djaurnment unless all the members are present.Consequently it is difficult for Justices to go home, andthose who cannot afford to lunch in a restaurant are compelled to go to a public house v/here they may bethought to be associating with persons appearing beforethem.-9-CONFSDENTBAL
(vii) I would like to see the present retiring age for Justicesgradually reduced from 75 to 70.(viii)  One of the principal complaints which I receive from membersof the public about Magistrates&apos; Courts is that the sentencingis unsatisfactory -  either because the penalties imposed are too great or too small or because the sentences imposed by different Courts are inconsistent.    It is not open to me, inmy executive capacity, to give directions to Magistrates onthe level of sentences which they are to impose.    I propose,however, to deal with this problem by organising SentencingConferences throughout the country on the lines of the conferences organised by the -Lord Chief Justice for HighCourt Judges, Recorders and Chairmen of Quarter Sessions.At these Conferences all Justices in each area would berequired to consider different types of case and to comparethe sentences which they would impose.    The Conferenceswould be attended, in an advisory capacity, by persons whoare expert in the Probation Service, Prisons and other institutions and in penology in general, and they would bepresided over by a senior Chairman of Quarter Sessions.(ix) Ex officio Justices ought to be abolished.     Conditional approvalwas given to this proposal by the Home Affairs Committee attheir meeting on 3rd December, 1965 (H(65) 28th Meeting).A list of the offices concerned is contained in my memorandum to the Committee (H(65) 129).    The Cabinet, however, at their meeting on 9th December, decided to defer further considera-tion of this question until they had had an opportunity toconsider my proposals for improving the system of selectingJustices (C. C. (65) 69th Conclusions, Minute 5).    It is quiteanomalous that there should now be two groups of Justices,one of which have been appointed on their merits, have under-gone a course of training and sit regularly, and another groupwho have not been appointed on their merits, undergo notraining and cannot sit regularly.    There are moreConservative than Labour ex officio Justices.    Out of a totalof 1,4-70 local authorities only 364 are actually controlled by labour.Following the meeting of the Home Affairs Committee on 3rd December, the Minister of Housing and Local government informed the local authority organisations of my proposal to abolish the ex officio Justices,    The County Councils and theGreater London Council were prepared to accept the abolitionof all local government ex officio Justices, but the municipal corporations and the Urban and Rural District Councils were opposed to abolition, though they recognised that somerestriction should be placed on everyone who became a justice and who did not both complete a course of instruction and alsoundertake to sit regularly.    I have seen representatives ofthe latter three authorities&apos; associations and have discussed the question with them.-10-
(x)  The key to the problem of appointing Magistrates lies in theAdvisory Committees.    The Advisory Committee system was introduced following the recommendations of the RoyalCommission of 1910, and it was carefully reviewed and approved by the Royal Commission of 1946-48.    I am convincedthat this is the best system for appointing Justices that can be devised, but I am equally convinced that the existing AdvisoryCommittees require fairly drastic reorganisation.    They are much too limited in their scope and most of them show littleinitiative in seeking candidates from all sections of the local community.    Moreover, most of them tend to be self-perpetuating because the Lord Chancellor has been obliged to rely very largely upon the Chairman of each Committee in finding persons to serve as members of the Committee.I propose to carry out a thorough review of all the Committeesthroughout the country, to get rid of the dead wood, and toreconstitute the Committees on the following lines s-(a) Each Advisory Committee should consist of at least one member of each of the leading political parties; but itshould also include persons who are not active politicallybut are drawn from different walks of life, and inparticular it should include persons such as Doctors who in their work meet large numbers of men and women of allsocial classes.(b) No member of an Advisory Committee should normally servefor more than six years.    It may be desirable to modifythis rule in the case of Chairmen but even they ought to change more often than they do now.    As regards county committees, all of these have as their Chairmen the lords -Lieutenant of the Counties.    This, hov/ever, is amatter of long-standing custom.    I propose in future toappoint someone else, instead of the Lord Lieutenant, as chairman of the County Committee if I think that this isin the best interest of the administration of justice in that particular area.(c) Committees must be made to take active steps to seeksuitable candidates among all sections of the local population.     The Lord Chancellor&apos;s Office should alsoapproach organisations throughout the country and ask forrecommendations.(d) The Lord Chancellor should exercise a much closer super-vision over the Advisory Committees and their work,(xi) The main reason for the unsatisfactory condition of the presentAdvisory Committee system is that in the past the LordChancellor has not been able to exercise adequate supervision of the Committees owing to the smalln.es s of his staff.    Thisconsists of the Secretary of Commissions, one other lawyer,one training officer, three Executive Officers and secretaries.-11-
CONFIDE NTS, ALTo organise the provision of training courses for Justices, tomaintain an adequate system of records of Justices throughoutthe country, to deal with an average of 900 appointments of newJustices and the removal of some 200 existing Justices every year, and to maintain a close (supervision over my 192 AdvisoryCommittees throughout England and Wales, my present staff is wholly inadequate.    In addition to this work they also haveto deal with the appointment and remuneration of Chairmen and deputy Chairmen of Quarter Sessions, Recorders, DeputyRecorders, Assistant Recordersj and Metropolitan and provincial Stipendiary Magistrates, as well as some 1,900Chairmen and members of ten different kinds of administrative tribunals and no less than 5,200 General Commissioners of income Tax, in addition to dealing with questions relating tothe Central Criminal Court and Commonwealth legal matters.It would not be possible for me to carry out my proposals relating to Justices unless this section of my department.rtm.ent was increased by at least two more officers of administrativegrade with the necessary secretarial assistance.(xii) If my proposals are accepted the additional cost of the staff and administration in my Department will be not more than 9, 000 a year.It is not possible to give an exact figure for the cost involvedin granting financial loss allowances to Justices nor in theremoval of the three-mile limit, because it is not known how many persons would apply for the allowances.    The HomeSecretary and I estimate that the probable additional costresulting from the removal of the three-mile limit would be inthe neighbourhood of  5 0, 000 a year, and that the grant of a financial loss allowance would cost about  100,000 a year.The figure of   100, 000 is based on the assumption that about10 per cent o  the Justices would draw the allowancej but theTreasury think that 5 0 per cent would be more realistic as a longer term assessment.    If they are right, the figure couldbe as much as  5 00, 000.    K all Justices were to draw the allowance the cost might amount to   1 million; but this couldnot in fact happen because all Justices would not be eligiblefor the allowance.Summary of Recommendations24.     My proposals may be summarised as follows:-(1)   Justices of the Peace, who must be well qualified forthe work, should be drawn from all social classes in thecommunity.(2)   To achieve this - \ \(a)   The Advisory Committee system should be reorganised and the Committees placed under close supervision by the Lord Chancellor&apos;department.-12-
House of Lords, s. W, 1.4th July, 1966.13-(b) Employers should be encouraged to allow their employees more time off to attend Court; and theGovernment itself should make it easier for CivilServants to accept appointment as Magistrates,(c) Justices should be entitled to financial loss allowances,(d) The three-mile limit for subsistence allowances shouldbe abolished,(3)   The retiring age for Justices should be reduced graduallyfrom 75 to 70,(4)   Ex officio Justices should be abolished,,(5)   Sentencing Conferences should be organised by theLord Chancellor !s Department throughout the country at regular intervals.(6)   To enable the Lord Chancellor to improve the selection ofJustices of the Peace he should be given a small increasein staff.iRecommendations (2) (c) and (d), (3) and (4) would require legislation.
