THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1966C (66) 86 Copy No.     6 72hA June, 1966CABINETEUROPEAN LAUNCHER DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATION :MINISTERIAL CONFERENCE IN PARIS ON 9th/10thJUNE, 1966Note by the Minister, of aviation at its meeting on 9th June (CC (66) 27th Conclusions, Item 2)the Cabinet authorised me as head of the United Kingdom delegation to the conference to make clear to our partners our serious doubts about the future technical and economic viability of the EuropeanLauncher Development Organisation (ELDO) but that nevertheless the United Kingdom would be prepared to reconsider its positionin regard to ELDO if:(i) an   early   and   substantial   reduction   in   our   futurecontribution to a figure which should not exceed 25 percent could be negotiated;(ii) an absolute money limit of say,  40 million were placedon our contribution;(iii) an arrangement could be arrived at whereby the ELDOprogramme would be reviewed annually and wouldincorporate suitable safeguards against automaticcommitment to escalating costs.2. I was, as expected, called upon to state our position at thebeginning of the meeting. After a brief reaction from other ministers, the conference adjourned to restricted session. while there was a clear desire to come some way to meet our point ofview, there was great reluctance to accept reduced contributions for the rest of the initial ELDO-A programme and after I had made clear that it was essential for new contributions to operate on the whole of our ELDO expenditure the conference adjournedon 9th June.&apos; 3. On the following day the principle was conceded but itwas impossible to negotiate a reduction from our presentcontribution rate of 38-79 per cent to 25 per cent since this involvedtoo great a variation from a scale of contributions based upon6964a
GNP figures and too great a consequential burden on the smallercountries. There was also the problem of allocation of work since we receive more than our present contribution. On a GNP basisour share would be 26-6 per cent. But after hard bargaining theother delegates were prepared to recommend to their government new contributions scale under which we would pay 27 per cent.In effect this scale amounts to a rounding off of the GNP figureswith France paying a little more and Italy a little less. Thedecisions taken by the conference, which were all to be referred to member Governments for endorsement, are embodied in theresolution which is reproduced as Annex A to this note.4. On the basis of a 27 per cent contribution related topayments from 1st January, 1967, the United Kingdom contributionduring the six years beginning on 1st April, 1966, would be asshown below. For comparison the cost at 25 per cent is also given.Remaining Cost of ELDO-A andPerigee/Apogee Programmes	1966-67	1967-68	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	Total	im.	im.	 m.	im.	 m.	im.	im.ELDO-A programme cost	29 0	22-5	13-5	7-6	2-7		75-3Secretariat costs	1-8	1-8	1-8	1-8	1-8	1-8	10-8Perigee/Apogee programme cost (United Kingdom estimate)	1-9	12-7	15-9	15-9	13-7	7-4	67-5	32-7	37-0	31-2	25-3	18-2	9-2	153-united Kingdom contribution							(a) at 25 per cent as from 1st January, 1967	11-36	9-25	7-8	6-32	4-55	2-30	41-6(b) at 27 per cent as from 1st January, 1967	11-55	9-99	8-42	6-83	4-91	2-48	44-185. The question of devising a procedure for controlling the costs of the programme, imposing cost ceilings, and carrying outperiodic reviews of the technical progress and costs of theprogramme was referred to a working group which was alsoinstructed to study the amendments of the Convention andFinancial Protocol which might be necessary, and also to make proposals for the distribution of work in connection with the eldo-PAS programme. The working group has been set up andwill meet in Paris on 20th-22nd June. Our representatives will include technical, legal and financial experts.6. The procedures for ensuring control of the costs of the programmes, and the amendments necessary to the FinancialProtocol and the Convention have been considered by officials ofthe Foreign Office, Cabinet Office, Treasury and the Ministry of
Aviation on the basis of a note prepared by the legal advisersof the Foreign Office. This note, which has been seen by the attorney-General, has been sent to our partners through the diplomatic channel with the explanation that it is the result of a preliminary study and is being submitted to the working group asa basis for discussion.  A copy of the note is at Annex B.7. Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the conference resolution refer to two further questions to be considered at the next conference on 7th-8th July, namely, the choice of an equatorial launching sie and the co-ordination of European space policy.8. On the first point we have hitherto maintained a strictneutrality as between the Australian and the French contenders,taking the line in official discussion that whichever site offered thebest proposition in terms of cost effectiveness should be chosen.The Secretariat have expressed a preference for French Guiana.The position has been complicated to some extent by the Australianoffer to provide freely certain facilities which they estimate to be worth $7-4 million. Whether the French are prepared to make a counter offer, or consider that their estimate includes one, is still tobe determined. In the meantime our best course seems to be tomaintain our neutrality.9. As regards the co-ordination of European space policy, the study group set up at the April session of the conference produced a report making certain recommendations for closer co-ordinationbut it has been generally accepted that this subject must be debated in the light of whatever is decided about ELDO. This remains theposition and this item is likely to be low on the agenda for the july meeting.10. I am circulating this paper for the information ofcolleagues. When the report of the working group is availableI will submit a further paper seeking guidance on the line to betaken at the further Ministerial Conference in Paris on 7th-8th July.11. In the event of the Opposition seeking an early debate,i.e., before 7th July I will, of course, seek immediate instructions as to the course to be pursued.F.

Decides also to examine during its third session theproblem of the co-ordination of European space policies referred toin paragraph 5 of the resolutions ELDO/CM (April 66) 17 whichwas the object of the report of the working group set up during thefirst session (ELDO/CM (June 66) 8).Annex note PREPARED BY THE LEGAL ADVISERS OF THEFOREIGN office. The Ministerial Conference which met in Paris on 9th-10th June, 1966, established a working group whose terms ofreference include the following:&quot; To study the amendments to the Convention or tothe Financial Protocol which might be necessary taking accountof Articles 14 and 21 of the Convention.&quot;2. The amendments contemplated are those which may berequired to give effect to the following proposals set out in theresolution adopted by the Ministerial Conference:(i) The adoption of a new scale of contributions for thecompletion of the initial programme as well as for thefurther programme referred to in paragraph (b) of the preamble to the resolution (hereinafter described as&quot;ELDO-PAS&quot;.(ii) The limitation of the financial commitments of member states to agreed annual amounts and agreed overallceilings for individual programmes.SECRET
3. There appears, for the reasons set out below, to be no doubtthat the proposals summarised in paragraph 2 above would requireamendment of the Financial Protocol. It is possible that theConvention itself would not need to be amended to give effect tothese proposals. The advantage of confining any necessary amendments to the Financial Protocol is that the latter can (underArticle 21 (3) and Article 14 (3) (d) (i) (8) of the Convention) be amended by a unanimous vote of the ELDO Council. If, on theother hand, amendments to the Convention were also required these,after being recommended by the Council for adoption, would not enter into force until 30 days after the United Kingdom (asdepository Power) had received notifications of acceptance in writingfrom all Member States (Article 21 (2)). This might mean delay,as most of the Member States are likely, in accordance with theirown constitutional procedures, to require specific parliamentary approval of amendments to the Convention before notifying their acceptance of such amendment.The adoption of a new scale of contributions4. It is envisaged in operative paragraph 1 of the resolution adopted by the Ministerial Conference that the revised scale ofcontributions would come into effect on 1st January, 1967. As fromthat date it would apply to the initial programme. It would also apply to the further programme (ELDO-PAS), if the latter is decided upon, from the beginning of that programme.5. Article 4 (2) of the Financial Protocol provides that&quot; during the period of the initial programme . . . approved Budgetexpenditure shall be met by contributions from Member States . . .assessed in the same proportions as the percentage figures set outin paragraph 2 of the Annex to the Protocol&quot;. Therefore, even ifit were only a case of revising the scale of contributions for the initial programme, both the second paragraph of Article 4 of the protocol, and paragraph 2 of the Annex to that Protocol wouldbe affected.6. It is, however, as mentioned above, also contemplated thatthe new scale of contributions will apply to the further programme(ELDO-PAS) as well as to the initial programme itself. Articles4 (3) and 16 (3) of the Convention envisage the possibility offurther programmes to which (under Article 4 (3)) Member states are obliged to contribute financially, unless they formally declarethemselves as not interested and therefore do not participate inthose programmes. Article 4 (3) of the Financial Protocolaccordingly provides that &quot; a revised scale of contributions inrespect of expenditure on the further programmes of theorganisation shall be recommended by the Council for acceptance by all Member States &quot;. The approval of a further programme would therefore seem in itself to require some addition to theFinancial Protocol, though not necessarily any amendment of theConvention. The latter takes into account that there may befurther programmes, and in addition to envisaging the possibility
of further programmes in Articles 4 (3) and 16 (3), also providesin Article 14 (3) id) (i) (7) that the Council shall decide by unanimousvote the majority necessary for decisions on certain questions(e.g., the adoption of the annual Budget) in respect of furtherprogrammes. The same provision (Article 14 (3) (d) (i) (7)) alsoenvisages that an orientation of the initial programme (as envisaged in Article 16 (3)) may amount in effect to a further programme.The limitation of the financial commitments of Member States7. Operative paragraph 1 (b) of the resolution adopted by the ministerial Conference envisages that &quot; the financial commitments of Member States should be limited to agreed annual amounts and agreed overall ceilings for individual programmes &quot;. This wouldrequire, at least, amendments to the Financial Protocol.8. A possible way of providing for such amendments, and forthe revised scale of contributions, would be to add a new Annex(Annex II) to the Financial Protocol, and to introduce this newAnnex by adding a new paragraph (numbered 6) to Article 4 ofthe Protocol.  This would read as follows:&quot; Notwithstanding anything contained in the previousparagraphs of this Article the contributions of Member states in respect of payments authorised in the Budget for id) the initial programme as from 1st January, 1967, and (b) the furtherprogramme (ELDO-PAS) shall be fegulated by the provisionsof Annex II to this Protocol.&quot;The first three paragraphs of the new Annex might be on thefollowing lines:&quot; 1. Payments authorised by the Budget for the initialprogramme as from 1st January, 1967, and for the furtherprogramme (ELDO-PAS) shall be met by contributions fromMember States which shall be assessed in the same proportionsas the percentage figures set out in the second column ofparagraph 3 of this Annex.2. The contributions of each Member State to the initialprogramme and to the further programme (ELDO-PAS) shallnot, however, exceed in any one financial year the amountsspecified in the third and fourth columns of paragraph 3 of this annex, and the total contribution of each Member State inrespect of the completion of the initial programme and of thefurther programme (ELDO-PAS) shall not exceed the amountsshown in the fifth and sixth columns of paragraph 3 of this annex.3. Table to serve as a basis for the assessment and limitation of contributions to the initial programme and to thefurther programme (ELDO-PAS).(Here follows table with six columns, headed respectively(1) Name of Country, (2) Percentage, (3) Ceiling of annual contribution to the Initial Programme, (4) Ceiling of AnnualSECRET
Contribution to the Further Programme, (5) Ceiling of total contribution to the Initial Programme, (6) Ceiling of total contribution to the Further Programme.)Footnote: There might also need to be further paragraphsabout the Australian contribution, and the sharing of percentagecosts between Belgium and the Netherlands.&quot;9. On the assumption that only the Financial Protocol, andnot the Convention itself, should be amended it would also benecessary to add: to Article 4 of the Financial Protocol a further newparagraph (numbered 7) which would cover the situation whichwould arise if the cost to completion of either programme appeared likely to exceed the estimate on which the contributions of member states are based. This new paragraph might read as follows :&quot; The initial programme and the further programme(ELDO-PAS) shall each be reviewed annually by the Council. If,on such review, it appears that the cost of completing eitherprogramme is liable to exceed the total amounts of thecontributions of Member States to that programme as shown inthe fifth and sixth columns, as the case may be, of paragraph 3of Annex II, any Member State may declare that it is not willingto contribute towards such excess cost, and shall then not be obliged to make any contribution to expenditure on that programme exceeding the total contribution shown in respectof that Member State in the relevant column. In that event theremaining Member States may decide by unanimous agreement to terminate the programme, or they may agree to share the excess cost between themselves according to a revised scale ofcontributions.&quot;Is any amendment of the Convention necessary?10. The Financial Protocol is an integral part of theConvention under Article 26 thereof. If the Financial Protocol wereto be amended on the lines suggested in paragraphs 8 and 9 of thismemorandum, it can be maintained that no amendment of theConvention itself is necessary, but that it must be interpreted and applied in the light of the Financial Protocol as so amended. Toplace this beyond any possibility of doubt there might be an AgreedMinute, which would be signed by the representatives of all member states on the Council when the latter adopts the amendments to theFinancial Protocol. This Agreed Minute might read as follows:&quot; On adopting by unanimous vote the amendments to theFinancial Protocol, the Council also unanimously declare thatthe Convention will be interpreted and applied in the light ofthese amendments.&quot;
