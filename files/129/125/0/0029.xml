confidential -       308DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 79 COPY NO. jj *?14th June, 1966CABINETCHANNEL, tunnel memorandum by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic affairs in this memorandum I report to the Cabinet, conclusions reached by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Development whenthey considered the Channel Tunnel project on 13th June, 1966.Outline2.      Our predecessors, in conjunction with the French Government,decided in February, 1964 to go ahead with detailed examination of thetechnical feasibility of and economic case for a Channel Tunnel, afterpreliminary studies had shown that, as between a   tunnel and a bridge,the advantage was decisively in favour of the tunnel.    What has been studied is a rail tunnel with a very large capacity for freight,passengers and accompanied cars.    Present estimates are that such a tunnel would take five years to construct and cost   134 million( 160 million inclusive of capital charges and interest capitalised overthe construction period).    For planning purposes it can be assumed thata maximum of 5 0 per cent of the capital and resources required wouldhave to be found from United Kingdom sources.3.     A joint official report on problems of organisation and financewill be coming forward in July.    But all the technical and economicassessments which we need to make up our minds in principle are already available; we cannot reasonably defer a decision on the grounds that thereis not enough information or that the matter has not been sufficientlystudied.    If v/e can reach a decision in principle by the time the french prime Minister and Foreign Minister come over here on 6th July, thereare obvious political advantages in doing so.Technical and economic appraisal4,      The technical and economic appraisals of the Channel Tunnelwere set out in detail in a memorandum circulated by the Minister ofTransport to the Ministerial Committee on Economic Development(ED(66) 49).    Members of the Cabinet v/ill have seen that memorandum,a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary on the foreign policyconsiderations (ED(66) 51) and a note recording the conclusions of theEconomic Development (Official) Committee (ED(66) 53).    There is no need for me to go over all this ground in detail again.    The positionbriefly is:-(a)    A bored tunnel is technically feasible, and no seriousgeological impediment exists.    A bored tunnel would be technically more satisfactory than an &quot;immersed tube&quot;tunnel.
(b) The tunnel would not impose any serious additional burden on the resources of the United Kingdomconstruction industry; and the man-power required should present no major problem.(c) On the latest estimates of traffic demand the overallnet economic benefit of the Tunnel, as compared withmeeting all the traffic requirements by means of surface or air transport (including hovercraft) issomewhere between  25 0 million and  35 0 million(depending on the volume of traffic), and the&quot;discounted cash flow&quot; rate of return is somewherebetween 17 per cent and 21 per cent.    Even if we assume that the tunnel costs  200 million (instead ofthe  134 million estimated) and that it ceases to carryany traffic at all after thirty years, the net economicbenefit is somewhere between  165 and  25 0 million.(d) The construction of a tunnel would obviously increase theattractiveness of the channel port area of the South Eastregion, though the growth of trade with Europe would inany case tend to have this effect,    We should have to beready to keep the growth of that part of the region under control, in the interests of our policies for other regions.But a stimulus to growth in that part of Kent, which is atpresent rather undeveloped, would not be unwelcome.Ashford is already being studied as a possible site for anew town of 100,000 or 150,000 people.    Moreover, theopening of a direct rail link with Europe, if associatedwith imaginative development of freight handling in therailways, could lead to more and better use of therailways for continental freight traffic, and to lesshandling and greater speed of transit for goods coming toand from the continent.    This should help to make ourgoods more competitive on the continent.    It could evenbring to our own deep sea ports ocean-bound traffic which would otherwise be shipped at continental ports likeHamburg.5.      This account is brief j but the studies which it reflects havebeen long and thorough.    Some members of the Economic development committee had some reservations on the estimates of cost and traffic on which the economic appraisal is based (though it must be said thatin the past the tendency has been to underestimate rather than over-estimate the growth of cross-channel traffic); and there was generalagreement that the regional consequences needed further study.    Butthe consensus of view in the Committee was, I think I can fairly say,that the technical and economic case for the Tunnel was established.As I have stated, even on pessimistic assumptions about capital cost and growth of traffic, the net economic benefit of the tunnel would still be substantial.    There are two particular implications of this to which I should draw attentionj-(a)    Compared with other methods of meeting the demand the Tunnel is highly capital-intensive; this means that the sooner it is constructed the greater the benefit.-2-
(b)    Over the period of thirty years it would be cheaper interms of resources and money to have a Tunnel than to rely on sea and air transport alone to meet thedemands for cross-channel transport.    Paradoxically,the most expensive course would be not to go ahead with the Tunnel.Organisation and finance6.      There have been long discussions with the French government about organisation.    British officials have urged that the Tunnelshould be constructed and operated as a public authority undertaking.It is clear, however, that the French Government will insist that theTunnel should be constructed as a basically private enterprise, raisingits own capital (partly, perhaps, under Government guarantee).     Theywill agree, on the other hand that the Tunnel should be operated by apublic atithority, which, it is suggested, should have the right toacquire all rights of the Tunnel after a certain period.    During thatperiod the operating authority would lease the Tunnel.    The leaseagreement would be for detailed negotiation,7,     The construction company would raise capital, partly on loanstock, partly as equity, in London and Paris, and perhaps also inother overseas markets.    The lease agreement would have to providethe equity holders with the prospect of a reasonable return on their 1investment, while ensuring that they did not reap excessive profits iftraffic turned out to be much heavier than estimated.    It would be forconsideration (and of course discussion with the French Government)whether the British Government should themselves seek to participate in the equity and so share in the profits of the investment company,as well as in the surplus earnings of the operating authority after allexpenses (including the rental to the investment company) had been met,    This question is being considered by officials.8.     Some members of the Economic Development Committee sawgrave objections of principle to having the Tunnel constructed andowned (at any rate for a  substantial number of years) by privateenterprise.    This was in their view essentially a project for fullpublic ownership and control from the outset.    They pointed out that&quot;risk&quot; capital would demand a satisfactory rate of return though there would in practice be little or no risk.9.     Other members - the majority - of the Committee, taking apragmatic view, v/ere ready to accept that private enterprise shouldconstruct and hold the Tunnel if there were practical advantages,subject to appropriate safeguards, particularly on the financial arrangements between the operating authority and the holding company and on the option to the authority to acquire all rights of the Tunnelafter a certain period.    The advantages of having a substantialelement of private capital would be:-(a) The capital would not have to come from the Exchequer.(b) It might well be desirable to tap European investmentfunds for this project, in order to leave domesticresources free for other domestic investment; in thepresent state of European capital markets privateenterprise would be in a better position than a public authority to mobilise such funds.-3-
10.     It seems to be clear that the French Government will not budgeon this.    We must reckon that, if we insisted on construction andownership of the Tunnel by a public authority from the outset, therewould be no prospect of going ahead in co-operation with the presentFrench Government.    The development of a Tunnel could well beset back by many years.Conclusions and recommendation11.     We are not asked to take a final decision on this;  clearly wecannot do so until satisfactory agreement has been reached on all aspects of the organisation and finance of the project.    We have,however, reached a point when we have to decide whether v/e acceptthe general form of organisation which has emerged from thediscussions so far and are content that detailed negotiations should proceed, or whether we do not want to go forward at all on the sort of basis that appears likely to be negotiable with the FrenchGovernment,    In my judgment we have all the material we can expectfor a decision.    We ought to take this decision in good time before theFrench Prime Minister and Foreign Miinister come over next month.12.     If v/e decided in principle to go ahead, we should want tocommunicate the decision to French Ministers;  indeed, it would nodoubt feature in a communique on their visit.  It would be very iimportant that any statement to French Ministers or public announce-ment should be in terms which did not prejudice our right to withdrawif subsequent negotiations failed to meet our essential requirements.But we must recognise that the further we advance in discussions withthe French Government the more difficult it will be to withdraw withoutdamaging political consequences.    To that extent a decision inprinciple to go ahead, even subject to reservations, will commit us,once it is conveyed to the French Government.13.     The Ministerial Committee on Economic Development, by asubstantial majority, recommend that we should take a decision inprinciple to go ahead with the Channel Tunnel without delay, on thebasis of a private enterprise company to construct and hold the Tunneland a public authority to operate it, subject tos-(a) seeing the joint official report in due course;(b) the outcome of detailed negotiations with the FrenchGovernment and with the private interests concerned on organisation and finance, and in particularsatisfactory conclusions on -(i)   the rental agreement between the operatingauthority and the investment company;(ii)   the terms and timing o  the option to the operating authority to acquire the rights of theTunnel from the investment company;(iii)   the distribution of the equity of the investmentcompany and the participation of overseascapital;-4-
G. B.Department of Economic Affairs, S. W. 1.14th June, 1966-5-(c) reservation of the British Governments right inprinciple to participate in the equity of the investmentcompany;(d) a guarantee of unrestricted access to the Tunnel forthrough traffic between the United Kingdom and continental countries other than France.The  Committee also considered that the consequences of a ChannelTunnel for regional planning should be further studied.14.     If the Cabinet accept this recommendation, I suggest that theMinister of Transport should be asked to prepare and circulate to the ministerial Committee on Economic Development for discussion assoon as possible a draft of a statement which could be made to theFrench Prime Minister on 6th July, and to arrange for preliminary discussions with the French Ministry of Transport, at ministerialor senior official level as necessary.
