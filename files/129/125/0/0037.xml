THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1966C(66) 87 Copy No.    6724th June, 1966CABINETREFORM OF THE HOUSE OF LORDSMemorandum by the Lord Chancellor and theLord Privy SealNext month Lord Alport is initiating a debate on the questionof reform of the procedure of the House of Lords which may wellinclude wider issues and we ought therefore to know what our colleagues&apos; view is about these matters. Indeed, we feel that inany case a Labour Government ought to have a policy about the reform of the House of Lords.2. Apart from minor questions, such as the televising ofdebates, the two major questions are the question of the powers ofthe House of Lords and the question of its composition.Powers3.  The two important powers of the House of Lords are:(a) Its power to decline to approve an Order or statutory instrument which requires the approval of both Housesor to disapprove one which is subject to the negativeprocedure. Such Orders and Instruments may be of vitalimportance, e.g., those relating to Rhodesia or toEmergency Powers. They are not subject to the parliament Act and if the House of Lords fails to approve one, there is nothing a Government can doabout it, except to re-lay it.(b) Its delaying power under the Parliament Act.  The Act isnot a simple one. The second Bill must be passed inthe next following Session. The second Bill must be identical with the first Bill. Both Bills must be sent tothe Lords at least one month before the end of the session. At least a year must elapse between thesecond reading in the Commons of the first Bill and thepassing in the Commons of the second Bill. Only threeActs have been passed under the Parliament Actprocedure (the Government of Ireland Act 1914, the welsh Church Act 1914 and the Parliament Act 1949).4. The present situation clearly provides the Lords with too great an opportunity for tactical manoeuvring of a kind which6974
could embarrass the Government and could limit its freedom to manage public business in the way which it judged best. This riskwould be liable to be particularly acute in the later stages of a parliament as we would wish to explain to our colleagues orally.We therefore believe that a Bill to curb the present powers of the lords ought to be introduced next Session when there would betime to pass it, if necessary, under the Parliament Act. We do notbelieve that the Labour movement would easily forgive a labour government with a majority in the nineties which, after twosuccessive Labour Governments, left the powers of the House ofLords intact, particularly as, while the 1964 Manifesto was conditional (&quot; We shall not permit effective action to be frustratedby the hereditary and non-elective Conservative majority in theHouse of Lords.&quot;), the 1966 Manifesto was unconditional(&quot; Legislation will be introduced to safeguard measures approved bythe House of Commons from frustration by delay or defeat in theHouse of Lords&quot;)&quot;.5. What is therefore in our opinion required is a Bill next session which (a) provides that any Act which subjects delegated legislation to the affirmative or negative procedure shall be read as referring only to the House of Commons;(b) provides that any Bill presented by a Minister to the commons may, on a resolution of the Commons, receivethe Royal Assent three months after it has been sent tothe Lords with such Lords&apos; amendments as the Commonsmay agree to, and that any Bill presented by a Minister tothe Lords must be passed by that House within three months of its presentation and that Commonsamendments thereto should not require the agreement ofthe Lords. (This would enable a Labour Governmentto make great use of the Lords, particularly at thebeginning of a Session.)Composition6. If the powers of the House of Lords are dealt with, webelieve that there would be much less difficulty in dealing withtheir composition. No one can really defend a House of over1,000 peers, not half of whom could get into the chamber to vote,and the large majority of whom support one political party.We think that there is a great deal to be said for mr. Henry Burrows&apos; Two-Writ Plan, recently summarised inThe Times. The Burrows Plan would allow all existing Peers,hereditary or created, to come to the House of Lords as now andsit and speak. They would not, however, be allowed to voteunless given a Voting Writ. The Voting Writs would be allocated(whether for life or a single Parliament is a matter for argument)in such a way as to destroy the built-in predominance of one party.The present quality of the debates would thus be preserved, whilethe overwhelming defect of the present House, the enormouspermanent majority of one party, would be removed.CONFIDENTIAL
Within this central conception, a good many variations are possible. One vital question would be whether the Governmentof the day would have a clear voting majority in the new Chamber.A Government would always desire such an advantage which the conservatives, but never the Labour Party, have always enjoyed.In practice difficulties arise at once. If, for example, one adopted the simple course of allocating Voting Writs to all first creationsand Life Peers the Labour Peers might be hardly more than a quarter of the present total (a nominal 75 activists out of a nominal287). In order to give the present Government a clear majorityit would be necessary, either to increase their numbers immediately and immensely, or deny a Voting Writ to many first creations, oradopt both courses.On the other hand, the Government could give themselves agood chance of winning divisions under normal conditions without making sure of a majority under all conditions if the Voting Writwere given to all first creations and life peers, but refused hereditary peers as such. (Outstanding hereditary Peers could be awardedVoting Writs on merit.) This would probably suffice for ordinarypurposes. In the Defence Debate just before the Election theOpposition amendment was carried by 107 votes to 55. If onlycreated Peers had been able to vote, the Labour Governmentshould have won by 44 to 29. We can assume, therefore, that under the Two-Writ Plan interpreted in this way (with a considerablestrengthening of the Labour Peers) we should usually be reasonablysafe, and with the reform of the powers of the House, as suggested above, a delay of three months should in any case be tolerableto a Labour Government.7. We are not, however, wedded to the Two-Writ Plan.There may be alternative proposals in this field which should beconsidered. Our proposal under this head, therefore, is that our colleagues should constitute a Cabinet Committee to consider this and other proposals for the reform of the composition of theHouse of Lords and related matters and to make recommendationsthereon to our colleagues and to consider and report to them towhat extent such recommendations would require legislation or howfar they could be implemented by alterations in the Lords standing orders.8.  The questions therefore are:(i) Should a Bill to curb the Lords&apos; powers be introduced next session in accordance with the election manifesto or should the thing just be allowed to drift?(ii) Should a Cabinet Committee consider the composition ofthe Lords and related matters and report to the Cabinetthereon?G.L.House of Lords, S.W.1,23rd June, 1966.
