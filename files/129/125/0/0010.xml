HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 6018th April, 196666COPY NC.CABINETCONTROL. OF GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE OVER.SEASMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the total of Government expenditure overseas is very large.    Ithas been increasing steadily over the years;  it has more than doubledin ten years.    Most of it places strain on the balance of payments;We must ensure that it is brought under control.2.       The following summary of the Table in Annex A indicates thegrov/th since 1955 of the major Government expenditures in the balanceof payments.Table united Kingdom Government Transactions in the Balanceof Payments(excluding imports and exports)Expenditure -Receipts       tMilitary (net)Overseas AidAdministrative, Diplomatic, etc.(net)Other Grants (mainly military)Other Official Long-Term capital(net)TOTAL (net)  million1955    I960    1965- 54   -164    -260- 83    -130    -168- 25   - 46   -76- 1512    - 22- 24   - 36    - 131966Forecast-281-195- 80- 23* 55-201    -388    -539       -524Defence3,      Some of the elements in the total of Government expenditure overseas have been brought under scrutiny.    The considerable overseasdefence expenditure (on the cost of stationing troops abroad and thepurchase of arms from abroad) has been considered as part of theDefence Review, where decisions have been taken which affect not onlySECEET
SECRET 74present costs, but expenditure over a long period of years ahead.    It hasbeen necessary, as part of the reshaping of our defence policy and programmes, for aircraft purchases abroad to increase for a period;though the impact which this represents is mitigated by the arrangementsmade with the United States for deferred payments.     The United states has also agreed, as part of the arrangements under which we buyUnited States aircraft, to purchase defence equipment in the UnitedKingdom to the value of $325 million over the next 12 years, and to help the United Kingdom to secure arms sales to other countries to the valueof $400 million over the same period.    Our current Agreement withGermany provides for offsetting payments over the three years 1964-67averaging about  55 million a year, or 60 per cent of the foreign exchange cost of our troops in Germany.    A substantial (but incalculable)proportion of these payments would however have accrued as normalexport earrings even had there been no Agreement.    All these receiptsare not reflected in the Defence Budget, but will benefit the balance ofpayments.    We have made it clear that we are only prepared to maintain our ground forces in Germany at about their present level providing some means is found of meeting the foreign exchange costs of these forces,I regard it as of the utmost importance that we achieve this objective,and intend to bring proposals before the Cabinet,    We can then look forward to a reduction of our foreign exchange costs in that area.    the forecasts assume that there will be a substantial reduction in foreign exchange costs in the Far East, as a result of political developments andthe implementation of our policy of closer interdependence.    In thisconnection the Prime Minister made it clear last December to thePresident that there was a limit (he had in mind a maximum of  185million a year) to the expenditure we could contemplate for the Indo-Pacific area.    We decided in the course of our discussions on the defence review that we should hold to this figure.4,       The figures now forecast for future years in the light of these policies and decisions are as follows:-Table II	Overseas Military Expenditure				1966-67	1969-70	1972-73	1975-76	(Estimates)			Stationing costs	271	195	195	195Other costs	29	23	23	23	,i          300	218	218	218Less receipts	30	26	26	26	270*	192^	192$	19245Imports by M/Defence	47	108	133	92Less				Exports by M/Defence	22	22_	22_	22_	25	86	111	70TOTAL		278	303	262*The difference between this figure and the  281 million shown in Table Iis attributable to the periods covered and the different price bases used(Estimates figures are taken for Table II),$These figures are based on Defence Review assumptions (OPD(66) 31) andare at March, 1965, prices.SECRET        &quot;2&quot;
8, Expenditure on these items as reflected in the Estimates in1966-67 is expected to be:-Table III  millionMilitary Aid 24. 5Diplomatic Service Vote (lessoverseas information content) net 35. 1Embassy and other government buildings Abroad 8. 7Subscriptions to international organisations 36.overseas Information Services 31.6136.59.       The Cabinet has already asked for an examination to take placeof some aspects of these programmes.    But I propose that we should,in addition, bring these smaller blocks of expenditure which have adirect impact on our balance of payments into a comprehensive annual review, to take place in the early Autumn (a few weeks after the PESCexercise), first in the Committees on Public Expenditure and then in theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee.    In preparation for the ministerial review, officials v/ould meet as appropriate;-secret,       We must keep the decisions we have taken continually before us inorder to ensure that we actually implement them and so achieve the reductions v/e have planned for.    In addition it will be necessary in my view to make further reductions in the foreign exchange burden.aid.       The overseas aid progremme is also already subject to control.We decided last summer that it should be contained for the next five yearswithin a total of  225 million (in money terms, subject to a review of the implications of the maintenance of a cash basis).    Nothing has happenedsince then to suggest we can afford more:  indeed there is a strong possi-bility that I shall have to ask for some reduction.    In any event we mustbe careful to arrange our affairs and our policy decisions so that every-thing which is &quot;aid&quot;, with the sole exception of military aid, is brought within that ceiling.     The continued control of aid will remain within the summer Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESC) exercise.Other Overseas Government expenditure.       This brings me to the rest of the field, including overseas representation and information, subscriptions to the international organisations and Military Aid.    It is true that within our expenditureon these items (and indeed on overseas aid), there is some element whichdoes not affect the balance of payments.    We could refine the figures butthis would make them unrecognisable.    It seems to me better to consider them in the terms where they are real to Departments - in Vote terms.If the total is reduced, the foreign exchange element will be reduced also;and the reverse also is stirely true.    So it must be our aim to securereductions.
12.     I ask my colleagues:-(a) To note that the continuing gravity of the balance of payments position requires further measures to control Government overseas expenditure, v/hich has played a highly significant part in the deterioration of our balance of payments over recent years and its present unsatisfactory state.(b) To agree that there should be a review by Ministers annually inthe early autumn of Government expenditure overseas as a whole, covering(i) Defence, where our purpose v/ould be to ensure that weare at least implementing the decision summarised inthe table in paragraph 4 above,(ii) Aid, where we would put the decisions we had takenearlier in PESC into this general picture.(iii)  Other (as set out in paragraph 8 above).(c) To agree that in selecting possibilities for examination in such a review, officials should not be restricted within existing policies orestablished practice. -Li. J . CH.M. Treasury, S. W. 1. SECRET18th April, 1966 -4-(a) to establish the prospective level of Government overseas expenditure as a whole in the forthcoming year on the basisof existing policies and programmes;(b) against this background to examine in detail the items on the&quot;third   group&quot; listed in Table III;(c) to recommend, looking at the field as a whole, what reliefcould be secured to the balance of payments, and in whichfields the reduction should take place.10.     We ourselves would take our decisions on the basis of the materialdisclosed in these discussions.    But I ask that it should be understoodbetween us that officials are free and under a duty to review existing policies and established practices in a far-reaching way in order tobring out all the possibilities of economy.    By way of illustration Irefer in the following paragraphs to the sort of points which may have tobe brought into consideration if we are to achieve real and effectiveeconomies.11.     (a)    Some parts of &quot;military aid&quot;, such as training of officers at British establishment or military training missions, are really a formof technical assistance.    Would it not be better to treat these as aidwithin an adjusted aid ceiling ?(b) What justification is there for any additional military aidbeyond this technical assistance save in the most serious emergencies ?(c) Could the Diplomatic Service Vote be reduced for example by increasing substantially the number of cases in which our representationis on a non-resident basis covering a group of countries?(d) Could the cost of Embassies etc., abroad be reduced by adjusting the present standards of accommodation?(e) Are we doing all we can by co-operating with other countries to keep down the increasing budgets of international organisations?   Dowe take too much upon ourselves by way of voluntary contributions?    can we adjust the formulae for assessment of contributions?    Are there notcases where our interest v/ould best be served by getting out altogether?(f) Should the level of overseas information expenditure befurther pressed down and formulated into a programme at a modifiedlevel, to be maintained over an agreed period ahead?Conclusion
