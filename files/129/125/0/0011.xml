idS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 61COPY NO. -19th April, 1966CABINETCOMPANIES bill memorandum by the President of the Board of trade at their meeting on 7th April (CC(66) 18th Conclusions, Minute 4)Ministers excluded the Companies Bill from the programme of legislation for the 1966-67 Session.    The minutes implied that it was possible tointroduce a much more ambitious Bill next Session,    It was also suggested that the present Bill was no longer urgent, and that it had been criticised for implementing the more conservative proposals of a generally conservative Report.2.      I have informed the Prime Minister that I am unhappy about thisdecision and he has commented that the matter would have to be brought back to Cabinet.    I set out below my reasons for suggestingr e conside ration.3,       We have, in my view quite rightly, represented the Bill with its provisions for much more extensive disclosure of information and forelimination of the exempt private company as one of our main measures for the modernisation of industry.    To defer it even until the 1967-68Session would mean that this new information might not be published until1969 or 1970.4.      Without the Companies Bill the legislative programme for thefirst Session could be criticised as containing little which contributed tothe aim of making industry more efficient.5.      I cannot accept the statement (see paragraph 1 above) that the bill was conservative in any sense other than that it was limited in scope inorder not to occupy an excessive amount of Parliament&apos;s time.    within these limits it was far-reaching: and the scope has now been widened.The main purpose of the Bill was to provide for more disclosure ofinformation for which there is a great deal of expert support:  and in this field it goes a long way beyond the proposals in the Jenkins Report oncompany law reform both in the range of companies affected and in the subjects covered.    In particular, by abolishing all the exemptionshitherto accorded to private companies it is much more radical than theJenkins Report.    It also lays obligation for greater disclosure,including the disclosure of export figures (which is a wholly new provision)on about 200, 000 companies.    It also includes an urgent amendment ofthe law relating to the assignment of rights under export credit insurancepolicies.6.      Criticism about omissions from the Bill will have already been largely met by our decision to add to the Bill provisions for the disclosure of the beneficial owners of 10 per cent or more of shares of a companyheld through nominees and for the strengthening of the existing provisions for the disclosure of directors&apos; share-dealings.-1-COOTIDEMTIAL
7.       I am all in favour of continuing to look beyond the recommendationsof the Jenkins Report.    I have already asked officials to consider suchwider issues as the proper place of the company in the modern economy,the right balance between shareholders, directors and employees, andwhether there are lessons to be learnt from recent developments inother countries.    I should prefer to wait until conclusions have beenreached on these wider issues before embarking on a further CompaniesBill.    Consideration of these wider issues will take some considerable time.    I am advised that it could not be done properly by next Session.I am sure that it would be wrong, and indefensible publicly, to deferlegislation on disclosure of information until consideration of the widerissues had been completed.    It probably means not legislating on themore urgent issues at all for up to three years.r8,      I suggest, therefore, that we should proceed with the present bill, with the additions mentioned in paragraph 6 above, and that we should introduce it in the first Session, as soon as the Bill about investment grants is out of the way, i. e. at the end of the year.    We should proceedmeanwhile with the far more ambitious preparation for a Bill wider thanthe Jenkins Report in a later Session.    We v/ould explain that it would necessarily be some time before we could follow up the immediate Billwith further legislation, and that we were using the interval to examinewider issues not considered by the Jenkins Committee such as the properplace of the company in the modern economy,9.       The further legislation which I have in mind would, of course,also deal with the other recommendations of the Jenkins Committee; but these, though numerous, are either not of the first importance or (e.g.non-voting shares) call for further examination as part of the wider studyto which I have referred above.10.      I feel strongly that the omission of the Companies Bill from theprogramme for the first Session would be wrong as a matter of policyand v/ould be widely and legitimately criticised.11,      I hope, therefore, that my colleagues will agree to reconsider their earlier decision, to include the Companies Bill in the programme oflegislation for the later part of the first Session and to consider whatreference 3hculd be made to this in the Debate on the Address.D.P. T. J.Board of Trade, S.W.1,18th April, 1966
