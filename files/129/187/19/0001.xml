C(76) 19 COPY NO      g [17 February 1976&quot; &apos;CABINETPRIVATE PRACTICE IN THE NATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services,     On 27 November Cabinet agreed that there should be consultations with the medical profession on the basis that the Government were firmlycommitted to the phasing out of pay beds from the National health service (NHS) and to preserving a healthy private sector; that the relationship between the private sector and the NHS was a matter whichtho Royal Commission was free to examine and report onj and that theGovernment would continue consultations on the long term arrangements   ,.for regulating the private seotor and ensuring that it did not oauseunacceptable damage to tho NHS.   (CC(75) 51st item 2),   Discussionsfollowed and on 15 December proposals (tho ,Goodman proposals&apos;) were published which the British Medioal Association (DMA) put to a ballot ofconsultants. -They are set out in full in Annex 1.2.     The results of the ballot are summarised in Annex 2.   In a low poll(55 per cent) there was a majority of about 5 to 2 against separatingprivate practice from the NHS but a majority of about 2 to 1 in favourof incorporating the proposals of 15 December in legislation if theGovernment does legislate for separation.   Paragraph f   of these pro-posals (see Annex l) provides for consultations with the professions ona voluntary system of control over the private sector and on whether anyreserve powers that it proved necessary to take in the legislation might be exercised by the independent Board.1
3.     The legislative timetable is in danger of slipping.   The Chief Whiphas said that there is no hope of getting- the legislation through this session unless we get Second Reading before Easter, io before the Budget.That means that the Bill which is being drafted would have to bepublished not later than 17 March and go to Legislation Committee on16 Maroh at the latest.4.     It is obviously in the BMA^s interests to delay matters as much aspossible eo as to prevent the Bill becoming law this session.   Theirresolutions (see Annex 2.) seem aimed to spin out consultations and possibly to seek modifications of the 15 December proposals to delay phasing outstill further.5.     If this were to happen we should be in grave difficulties with ourown people in the House, with the National Executive Committee of theLabour Party (NEC) and with the health unions.   A Motion denouncing the*Goodman, proposals has been before the last two meetings of the NEC andit was only with great difficulty that I succeeded in getting it referredto the Home Policy Committee where I was able to modify it.   Last week I received a deputation from the National Union of Publio Employees whoseexecutive is overwhelmingly opposed to the ,OoodIIlan, proposals and ishinting at industrial action.   There is a danger that the national association of local Government Officers will follow suit.   Any suggestionthat the Bill will be postponed will lead to an eruption of direct actionagainst pay beds.6.    In the circumstances, the best course is to combine progress withthe Bill with assurances to the consultants that those consultations whichthey were promised in the Gooaman proposals con oontinue after its publication.   (Those were on the location of the 1,000 beds to be phased.out within six months of Royal Assent, and control of the private sector).7-     I.suggest therefore that the only course of action open to us iB -a.    to announce that the Government is preparing legislation onthe lines of the Goodman proposals and intend to publish the Billin time for the Seoond Reading before Easter;2
b. to announce simultaneously that we are entering into consulta-tion with the DMA   and the unions on the two points identified inthe ,Goodman proposals1 as requiring consultation although notimplying that this will be completed before the Bill is published.I do not propose consultations on all the other details of theBill;c. to proceed with immediate consultations with NHS authorities on the selection of the 1,000 beds, so as to carry this as far aswe can before the Bill is published.I should be glad to know if my colleagues agree with this general approach.   I would propose to report to them about the progress made inoonsultation, before presenting the Bill to the Legislation Committee.B A department of Health and Social security london SE117 February 19763
The &apos;Goodman Proposals&apos; were:ANNEX 11.   The Governments policy, as the Queen&apos;s Speech made clear, is that legislation will be introduced in the course ofthis session to phase private practice out of NHS hospitals,and this remains the policy of the Government.   As the Secretaryof State indicated in her letter of 8 October to Dr Stevensonthe legislation would reenact the existing guarantee onthe right of consultants to combine NHS and private practice.In announcing the setting up of the Royal Commission on20 October the Prime Minister also made clear that the Governmentare &quot;committed to the maintenance of private medical practice inthis country&quot;   and &quot;intend to guarantee this in the legislation&quot;.The problem is to relate the phasing out of pay beds to thepreservation of the right to practice medicine privately.?.    The legislation would contain first a broad declaration that private beds and facilities should be separated from the NHS;secondly, an expression of the Governments commitment to themaintenance of private medical and dental practice in this countrythrough the renewal of the provision in the 1949 Act which maintainsand dentiststhe right to private practce by entitling doctors/to work bothprivately and in NHS establishments;    and thirdly the establishmentof an independent Board to relate these two commitments.3.    Despite its continuing opposition, the medical and dentalprofessions acknowledge that the phasing out of pay beds in NHShospitals may, through legislation, become the will of Parliament.In that event the phasing out should be subject to the safeguardsoutlined below -a)   The criterion for phasing out shall be the reasonableavailability of reasonable alternative facilities(including accommodation, services and eouipment)
within a reasonable geographical distance and towhich reasonable access Is available to those patients and practitioners desiring to avail themselves of it.b) Subject to Parliaments decision, it is accepted thatthere are some pay beds and facilities which couldbe phased out from the NHS without undue delay, there being already reasonable alternative beds and facilities;   and that the Government will publish in a schedule to the Bill the location of 1,000 pay beds tobe released to general NHS service within six monthsafter the Bill has received Royal Assent.   In determiningthis Schedule the Government will wish to consult fully with the medical and dental professionyand with those responsible for providing private medical and dentalfacilities outside the National Health Service.   TheGovernment will also wish to consult at the level ofthe individual hospital.   The criteria for use in these consultations and in determining the content of theSchedule shall be the extent to which the pay beds arebeing used and the reasonable availability of alternativebeds and facilities for the practice of private medicine.The legislation will supersedethe existing powers of the Secretary of State to authorisepay beds and it is not her Intention pending the passageof the legislation to vary the existing numbers.c) It Is also accepted that the phasing out of the remainingprivate facilities should be subject to the creation ofan independent Board appointed by the Government.   TheBoard will have an independent Chairman (the appointmentof whom will be the subject of consultation with allinterested parties) and four other members appointed by the Government.   Two would be members of themedical profession and it would be the governments intention to ensure that these members were acceptable to the profession.   The remaining two would be appointed
after consultation with other NHS staff and other interested parties.d)   In determining the phasing out of pay beds and facilitiesfrom the NHS the Board shall be guided by the followingcriteria:i.   that for the retention of beds or facilitiesfor private practice in NHS hospitals thereshould be reasonable demand for private medicinein the areas of the country served by thoseparticular hospitals;ii.   that for the abolition of beds or facilities for private practice in NHS hospitals there should beavailable sufficient accommodation or facilitiesfor the reasonable operation of private medicinein the areas of the country served by tho**particular hospitals;iii.   that in those areas of the country presently servedfor private practice by a particular NHS hospital,all reasonable steps had been or were being takento provide private beds or facilities outside NHShospitals and that this would be kept under continuous review;iv.   that where all reasonable steps to provide in thearea of the country concerned alternative privatebeds and facilities outside an NHS hospital that could be taken were not being taken this would,after due warning, be itself grounds forrecommending the withdrawal of facilities for private practice in that particular NHS hospital.e)   The Board shall not necessarily retain existing privatefacilities for the purpose of specialised operations^treatments and investigations where the NHS isprepared to make such accommodation and equipment reasonably
available on an occasional basis for individualrequirements in specified circumstances and at an appropriatecharge.   The Bill would propose to allow health authoritiesto provide and charge for such specialised services for patients provided that they can satisfy the Secretary ofState that there will be no disadvantage to NHS patients,and that such patientB - whatever their country of origin -are admitted on the same basis of medical priority as anNHS patient.   The Secretary of State will also have to besatisfied that these specialised services cannot reasonably be provided in the private sector to a satisfactory standardin this country.   Details of such arrangements will beregularly notified to the Department.   Charges will be madeto these patients, (or in the case of patients sponsored by overseas Government, to their Governments) and therewould be no subsidy by the NHS.   No professional feeswill be received by whole-time NHS staff, for their personalbenefit, but an appropriate element of the total chargewill be retained by the health authority, or in the case ofan academic unit, the University Department, to be usedfor medical and dental research or development work.Such an arrangement would be similar to the practice which already exists in respect of academic units by which feesfor private treatment are received by the practitionerbut are passed on to the unit*s research funds.   Staffon a part-time contract would be entitled to receivefees from these patients (or sponsors of such patients)and the amount would be determined in the usual way byagreement between the parties concerned.f)   As stated in the Oueen&apos;s Speech the regulation of theprivate sector following the separation of pay beds willbe subject to further consultation with the professions.In the meantime the Government needs to be satisfied that developments in the private sector do not sigiificantlyendanger the service the NHS gives to its patients andwill enter into consultation with the medical and dentalprofessions as to how this can be achieved by voluntarymeans     The consultations would cover the point as to
whether any reserve powers that it proved necessary totake in the legislation, might be exercised by theindependent Board.g)   The Government believes it is for urgent consideration that a common waiting list should be achieved betweenNHS and private patients in NHS hospitals.   the professions maintain that if any such scheme is apossibility it can only operate for urgent cases, in viewof the varied nature of the waiting lists and facilities available at different hospitals.   The Government maintainsthat it is possible to devise common waiting listarrangements by which all NHS and private patients are admitted on grounds of medical priority alone.   Theseare matters for detailed discussion.   The Bill willinstruct the Board within six months of Royal assent to make recommendations to the Secretary of State (taking into account the representations of the professions and allother relevant considerations) on the best possibleprocedures to be undertaken in NHS hospitals covering thosebeds and facilities that are still to be phased out.
