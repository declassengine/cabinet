C(76) 4COPY NO     gj2 February 1976CABINETLAND SUPPLY measures memorandum by the Minister for Planning andLocal Government1,        During discussion at the Ministerial Committee on Economic policy on  6 January about development land tax, I outlined some of the measureswe are working on to help the flow of land needed for development over thene:;t few years.    Some of our measures will yield their main returns onlyin the longer term but others should make an immediate impact.    It maybe helpful for the next round of our discussions if I set these out briefly.LAND HELD BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES FOR OWN HOUSING PURPOSES2.        A recent survey shows that last year English authorities held ontheir housing account 25, 000 acres (tome 380, 000 plots).    Manyauthorities have more than they need ia the short term and most of this issuitable for housing whether public or private.    The land scheme will involve authorities taking a new comprehensive view of public and private housing needs and this should enable a significant release cf land in some areas.LAND HELD BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES FOR OTHER PURPOSES3.        Total local authority (LA) land stocks in Great Britain, held for all purposes, including housing, are estimated to be anything between 50, 000-100, 000 acres.    It is unclear how much of this could be used for private housing - either to top up where LAs are releasing existing public housingsites for private development, or disposed of direct to private builders -but there is obviously considerable scope and this is being reviewed.VACANT LAND AND INFRASTRUCTURE4.        A special aspect of local authorities&apos; holdings is the considerableacreage in inner city areas including 3, 700 acres in England resulting fromslum clearance activity.    The 2 particular problems are the financial losswhich Home authorities mifht incur in disposing of such land (even after the75 per cent slum clearance subsidy) and the high cost of providinginfrastructure.    Desirably, any future measures to promote employment
in the construction industry in the medium term should help localauthorities to make such land available for low cost housing.    The problemof infrastructure provision both for these areas and elsewhere in order to achieve significant releases of land for development is being studied.RELEASES BY THE PUBLIC SECTOR5.        Review and release of local authority land will need to be comple-rfl*;&quot;.*Md by releases of surplus land from other parts of the public sector.So far as statutory undertakers1 land is concerned, Ministers will need to lay down in advance the criteria by which they wiH settle disputes over whatis or is not operational land, with the aim of Establishing that, within thelaw, they will be giving priority to housing needs.POLICY ON DENSITIES6.        I look to increased density of private housebuilding as a majorstrand in our strategy to help land supply.    The present average densityof private housebuilding development is 10.7 dwellings per acre.Planning permissions for higher densities will mean not only that thepresent stock of -&apos;and would provide more dwellings but that builders willbe able to make more effective use of their future land supplies.Particular measures I envisage here include special weight to the need for housing land where Ministers are considering appeals for higher densities,accelerated treatment of density appeal cases, guidance to local authorities that land scheme loan allocations will favour authorities proposing highdensity releases and urgent examination of the inter-relation of DLT anddensity policies.TREATMENT OF SMALL SITES7.        Finally there are the 2 measures I suggested to EC that wouldparticularly operate on the smaller sites.    Under the Excepted DevelopmentRegulations housing sites will be outside the normal scope of land schemeacquisitions where the development is no more than 1, 000 square metres -about 15 houses.    I expect this to give an impetus to building on this sort of site and since some 30 per cent of housing is thought to be in the form ofsmall scale development, we are talking about a lot of minor activity.    Iintend to review the regulations later this year when there is experience of operation and would consider then if lifting this level to 1, 500 square metreswould be desirable.8. The companion measure would be a stimulus to sellers of thesesmaller plots and I proposed to this end the raising from  5, 000 to  7, 500that slice of development value aUowed before DLT applies.    This couldeven be as high as  10, 000 if it were felt that some concession for agriculture and industry waa imperative.    This could be ab initio.    Nomeasure can be put on exactly how many transactions it would affect but2
clearly it would make it much more attractive for the owner of the smallsite to sell.    The Hcusebullders&apos; Federation have represented to me thatthis is an important source of land for them.    It would make much lessimpact on the owner of the large site with a lot of development value, butthis is the sort of land on which I want the local authorities to concentrate,so that public and private activity would complement one another.9.        I seek colleagues&apos; full backing for measures on these lines.J department of the environment  February 19763
