THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(76) 16COPY NO      Si16 February 1976CABINETSTUDENTS1 FINANCE AND UNEMPLOYMENTMemorandum by the Lord President of the council.        At their meeting on 5 February last, the Cabinet discuseod thepossibility of introducing an Interim scheme to keep students out ofunemployment offices in the coming Easter vacation.    I was asked, inconsultation with the other Ministers concerned, to overeae an urgentreview by officials of all the possible interim schemes which had beensuggested and to report to the Cabinet on the outcome in order thatthis could be taken into account before the announcement of this month1 sunemployment figures, and of thta changes in their future presentationwhich have been agreed, on 24 February.2.        Last week I consulted colleagues directly concerned - the secretaries of State for the Environment, Employment, Social Services,Scotland and Education and Science, and the Chief Secretary - about four Interim schemes which had been proposed.    There seemed insuperable difficulties in the way of three of mem.    But a variant of the PrimeMinister&apos;s Policy Unifs scheme seemed at first sight more hopeful; underthis new scheme local education authorities would be asked to pay the summer term grant on or after 1 April.    This would involve lessdisturbance than the other schemes would have done to authorities1established procedures for paying grants and, since payment would be madein the new financial year, it would avoid the problems which were seenfor Rate Support Grant or Exchequer payments.3.        However, colleagues have pointed out three serious difficulties inthe way of even this course.    First, there is a substantial risk that anamending Regulation operating on grants payable in the current year wouldbe ultra vires.   Second, the scheme could not be expected to lead the supplementary Benefits Commission to refuse benefit to students whoclaimed it.    Third, to invite the local authorities to implement the scheme from 1 April would seriously damage our attempts to secure localgovernment co-operation in our economic policies.
4. These objections, particularly perhaps the first, seem to medecisive.    No doubt the Secretaries of State for the Environment,Social Services and Education and Science and the Attorney General canexpand on them if necessary.    If the Cabinet agree, the best that we shallbe able to do for the coming Easter vacation ie;-a. to remove student figures from the genuine unemployment figures and publish them separately, announcing this intention,as we have agreed, when mis month&apos;3 unemployment figures are published;b. at the same time, give some indication of the policy we proposeto adopt for the support of students during the vacation in the nextacademic year, on the lines of the scheme already approved bySS Committee.E privy Council Office16 February 19762
