Y/INTER FUEL BILLSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social ServicesINTRODUCTORY1.   The minutes circulated by various of us in the week before last andthe paper (c(76) 11) by the Secretary of State for Energy which we discussed at Cabinet last week (C(?6) 5th Conclusions, Item k) showed the serious concern whioh we all feel about how pensioners and otherbeneficiaries, and families in work on low wages, are to meet theirfuel bills this winter.    It may be helpful if I set out what seem tome to be the main factors in the problem.THE problem.    The problem seems to me to have six important components.   1 dealwith these in more detail in the iainex to this paper, but summarilythey are -a. The very heavy increases in fuel prices over the last too years,b. The lijnited extent to which those increases are effectivelycovered by our general uprating polioy for social security benefitsalthough the price increases bear particularly harshly on the poor.o.   The limited degree to which the supplementary benefits (SB)scheme oan help.d. The faot that people&apos;s perceptions of the situation are a gooddeal worse than the problem itself, together with the campaignabout it in the media.e. The concern of our own supporters.1C(76) 17 COPY HO      8117 February 1976c;.binet
f.   The fact that the action within his control which theSecretary of State for Energy has now announced can only make a relatively limited impact on the situation this tTinter,3.   My colleagues will wish to make their own judgment of these factors.   My assessment of them taken together is that they add upto an unfavourable picture, and that, rightly or wrongly, ure are bound to be pressed for further action - and action which is bothearly and falls specifically in the social security field - to dealwith an emergenoy situation which can be regarded as partly of ourown making.   VJhat form could such action take?POSSIBLE action if.   An inorease in the discretionary heating additions in line withthe April increase in fuel prices would give derisory results(Annex, paragraph 5).   The only way to give additional cash help toall those at risk would now be through the payment of a lump-sum onthe lines which I proposed last November.    In brief, my proposal thenwas for a tax-free winter fuel payment to some 10&amp; million people,including all retirement and supplementary pensioners, widows&apos;benefit, invalidity pension and attendance allowance recipients,those (including the unemployed) on a continuing supplementaryallowance and the recipients of the Family Income Supplement (fis).At  10 each (tax-free) the cost would be  105 million.   To giveeffective help this winter, such a payment would have to be made as quickly as can bo.   The earliest possible week for payment would nowbe that beginning 5 April, Tout this would be dependent on the PostOffice being willing to undertake the task in that week, when theywill have in any case a much increased volume of business to dischargeon my Department&apos;s behalf because of the approach of  aster; on firm decisions being taken in time to enable us to go ahead with aprinting order by 20 February; and on enacting by 2 April the short bill which would be required.   It would be necessary also to securethe agreement of my own Staff Side and that of the Department ofEmployment to this timetable.   While making the payment would not involve any increase in permanent posts, the work would cost staff2
resources by the use of overtime or casuals.   There would be no accom-modation implications.   I think if we anhounoed our decision to makothe payment, and the date for it, before tho end of this month, thefact that it would actually come near the end of tho winter would, beaccepted.   Moreover, payment at the beginning of April would clearlymark the distinction which wo would want to maintain from a Christmasbonus paid in November or December.OBJECTIONS5,   I am of course fully aware that my proposals for a fuol paymentwere rejected by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy last november, and we havo made public our decision not to make a payment in a letter to the TUC and a Parliamentary inswer given on 16 January.The main reasons which decided the EC Committee were referred to in theChief Secretary&apos;s letter to mo of 6 February which was copied to all members of the Cabinet,   But, for convenience, the succeeding paragraph,which has been agreed with the Chief Secretary, sets out tho argumentsagain -6,   a.   The main reasons for which the Committee rejected the proposalfor a  10 payment last November were that the uprating of all social security benefits which took effect on 17 November 1975 (and whichhad in any case been advanced by a fortnight from its originally intended date of the beginning of December) would in general besufficient to cover additional heating costs, particularly if taken with the concurrent increase of nearly hO per cent in tho SBdiscretionary heating additions, which themselves now go to almosthalf of supplementary pensioners.   These reasons remain valid nowin objective terms, all the more since the Committee also agreedthat tho heating additions could themselves bo incroased againthis spring to take account of further fuel price increases since last autumn.b.   The payment would be unselcctive and would therefore go tomany who do not need it.   It would also have to be tax-free - anaspoct which would be more valuable to the better off than tothose who pay tax at the basic rate.3
c. We cannot afford now - any more than we could last autumn -the addition of  105 million to the public sector borrowing requirement.d. We have very recently announced in Parliament that therewill be no fuel payment.   If we change our minds now it willseem weak and vacillating.   Moreover, however we try to distinguish it, many people will take it that we have after all gone back on our decision, firmly announced last Kay,that there would bo no Christmas bonus in 1975-e.  10 per individual will in tiny case make little impact onthe very largo quarterly fuel bills which are said to be thereal crux of the matter; and yet to pay it will cost us no lessthan  105 million.conclusion.    I invite, my colleagues to consider -a. whether there is or is not a case for reversing the decisionof the EC Committee last November against making a winter fuelpayment; and b. if they decide that there is, to agree -i. that it should take the form of a tax-free payment of 10 to 10^ million beneficiaries, at a cost of  105 million,to be made, subject to the necessary printing arrangements,and the agreement of the Post Office and the Staff Sides ofmy Department and the Department of Employment, and subject also to the required legislation being enacted, in the woekbeginning 5 April, but with an early announcement; and ii. to afford the Bill which will be required the necessarypriority, as regards the employment of Parliamentary Counseland in the Parliamentary timetable, to secure Eoyal Assentby 2 April.B A department of Hoalth and Social Security17 February 1976
The six main factors in the present situation(a) Fuel price Increases1,   The increases in domestic fuel prices made over the last two years in pursuit of the Government&apos;s policy of phasing out subsidies for the nationalised industries have been very heavy indeed.   The figures overthe period October 1973 to January 1976 are:-ELectricity 96*4 per centGas 46.5 peri centOil and Paraffin 117.9 Per cent       -                 ^; Coal 61.8 per cent            ^And further substantial increases are in view for April, vith both theproposed rise in the price of coal and the application^)/ the electricity industry currently In the news.(b) Increases In,social security benefits2.   Pensions and other benefits generally vent up from October 19T3 to january 197 6 by 70 per cent, as against an increase in the Retail prices1Index (EPl)f all items, of 53 per cent and one in the fuel element in thatindex of 75.5 per cent.  Thus it can legitimately be said that theGovernment have protected beneficiaries against price rises overall; butthis cannot quite be claimed in relation to fuel costs by themselves.   Therewill be no further general uprating- of benefits until the autumn.3.   Koreovor, the EPI and its components do not reflect precisely the impact of a price rise for a particular fuel, nor can they reflect the importanceof that fuel for a particular consumer.   So the movement of the EPI over-all, or even of its fuel component, is no real measure of the impact of,for example, electricity price increases on the occupier of an ell-eleptric house or flat.   Overall, it can fairly be said that fuel price increases hit the poor especially hard.(c J   The r:vrt yMch^ the Runpleaentaiy; benef Jjt^jfSTJ) scheme can play4.     The degree to which the SB scheme can help further is limited.   Thescheme excludes everyone in full-tijae work, and thua by definition thoGeon low waces, who can be expected to be in substantially as much difficulty Iover fuel bills as those on SB itself.   Those who are eligible for SBcay be entitled to extra heating additions, payable at standard rates of
55P.  1.10 and  1.65 a week, where there is ill-health or the recipient-  occupies a damp or draughty dwelling.   These additions are increased from time to time by reference specifically to the movement of the fuelcomponent in the EPI.   Even so, they cannot respond precisely to rises in the price of individual fuels.   In fact, the additions have been increased by 83 per cent since October 19731 whereas the price ofelectricity has nearly doubled.   The number of extra heating additions* has increased considerably over the past two years (from ^ million to nearly one Billion) but the great majority (61 per cent) are in paymentat the lowest rate, 29 per cent at the middle rate and under 2 per cent at the highest rate.   8 per cent are paid at non-standard ratesprimarily to help those with central heating.5.    It ie the case that the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy (EC)have agreed in principle that the additions should be further increasedto take account of the fuel price rises anticipated in April.   Currentindications are, however, that these rises would justify increases inthe three rates only of the order of 6p, 12$ and 18p respectively, ata coot of  3^ million a year.   In present circumstances such increases would be likely to appear derisory.   She increase in the lowest rate,applying in 61 per cent of cases, would yield an addition of      a quarter.6.    Further, while something over 85 per cent of all the extra heatingadditions are paid to supplementary pensioners, it remains the factthat, taking the retirement pensioner population as a whole, only some-thing like one in ten of them get an addition.   At the other extreme,those in receipt of FIS are not entitled to the addition.7.    She Supplementary Benefits Commission have just issued frerjh guidance to local offices about the award of lunp-Eua paymento to help withfuel billc including, for this winter, help to people who have in thepast budgeted satisfactorily but who are now caught by the size ofthe hills received.   In addition, new arrangements have been agreed between the Commission and the gas and electricity authorities to avoiddisconnections for people entitled to supplementary benefit whore alurrp-sum payment vrould not be justified but hardship would occur ifthere were disconnection.   Under these arrangements, deductions fromthe weekly benefit will be made towards the debt and paid direct to the fuel cuthorities.
(d)    Thn^ap ^iG^:N.N.I.\ frctn pnd the iijrc option of tKirm facts8.   This is a field where the objective facts of the eituation and pcople&apos;cperception of them are very far apart.   There has been real and growingevidence that elderly people in particular are afraid to use what heat-ing they have.   It is not enough to tell people at risk that they chouldnot over-economise on heating, when throughout the winter the &quot;Switchit off because you can&apos;t afford not to&quot; campaign has been going on, andwhen people are terrified at the thought of the heavy bills which theyvill incur or have incurred.   It is the impact of the very heavyquarterly bills which is the crux of the matter at present, and whichthe media are increasingly and effectively highlighting.   Examples arenow often quoted of quarterly electricity bills of  50 and more, andreiteration by the Government of the substantial successive benefit increases, and of the fact that these ought to yield the prudent managerenough to meet current fuel costs, does not convince those who are faced with and shocked by far larger fuel bills than they have ever been accustomed to or expected - and bills which they simply cannotmeet.   It is in this context that the concern with claimed hypothermiadeaths of old people must be placed.(e) The concern of the Government&apos;s su-pnorters9.    Beyond the campaign of the media there is the concern of the Government * iown supporters.   The TUC have more than once pressed on the Secretaryof State for Social Services the case for special help with fuel billsthib winter; a deputation from the National Executive Committee of theParty raised the subject (among others) with the Secretary of State inJanuary; and Mr. John Golding, HP (Hewcastie-under Lyrae) secured leave for the First Reading of a Bill &quot;To provide for the payment out of theNational Insurance Fund of a heating allowance for pensioners and those on long-term supplementary benefit.....&quot; on 21 January.   There are nowfrequent Questions in the House on the matter.(f) Action within the sphere of the Secretary of State for Energy10.   Any possible restructuring of energy tariffs to help the poorerconsumers has been ruled out by the EC Committee, and the report whichwas published on this subject on 16 February well illustrates thedifficulties.   What the area fuel boards have done to promote &quot;easypayment&quot; and instalment schemes, though helpful, must neceGsarily
be of relatively limited effect; and the further review of nethod:;of payment under Lord Lovell- Davis,which is now to be put in hand,could not be expected to produce any results for this vfinter.On the question of disconnections (some 120,000 in 1974-5) theadministrative action which ha3 already been taken will be re-inforced by the steps to prevent the disconnection of pensionerhouseholds which tho Secretary cf State for Energy announced in thewhichHouse on 16 February and/will clearly be very helpful.   But thereare many vulnerable households not included in the category of&quot;pensioner&quot; and not on supplementary benefit; and, in any event,the temporary prevention of disconnections for non-payment of a billdoes not remove the need for eventual payment of that bill - and also of the one after that.
