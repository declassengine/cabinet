C(76) 9 COPY NO     816 February 1976CABINETPOLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF CIVIL SERVANTSMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal. This paper seeks a decision on how we should respond to pressure,from the Staff Side of the National Whitley Council for the Civil Service,that restrictions on the political activities of civil servants should be relaxed,2.        The existing rules, the Staff Side&apos;s proposals and a tentative offer made early in the current negotiation? by the Official Side are set out inthe attached Annex, which also summarises (in paragraphs 6-7) mycolleagues&apos; reactions to my letter to them of 9 September 1975, andexplains (in paragraph 9) the views of the Opposition.3.        Although the numbers who would in practice take advantage of any relaxation of the rules would not be great, there are widespread Staff Sidefeelings of reaction against any constraint on freedom.    This has beenevidenced by the passing of Conference resolutions to this effect by several of the Staff Associations.    The Staff Side have now taken a public stand cmthis issue, and they feel it is one of the few matters of concern to them atthe moment on which they can hope to make some progress.    following the Salmon Commission^ refusal to consider this subject, they have madea formal request to the Head of the Home Civil Service for an independent committee of enquiry to be set up.    The problem is not, therefore, goingto go away.4,        I indicated in my letter of 9 September that I did not think that wecould just stick to the present rules, although there was wide disagreementamong my colleagues over how far any relaxation should go.    I now believe it is more important than ever that we make a positive response to theStaff Side.    The Civil Service is in marked public disfavour at present.This is not improving its morale.   Difficult times lie ahead for theService - retrenchment of numbers and costs, while we as Ministers stillwant a great deal done.    This is no time, therefore, to get into aconfrontation with the Staff Side which could be avoided.    Rattier, I believe it would be well to fall in with reasonable Staff Side requests whenever wecan.1
2i. Not to go beyond the concessions already suggested by officials,,    This was the course preferred by eight of mycolleagues.    But these concessions have already been rejected by the Staff Side and fall far short of what would be acceptable tothem.    In the opposite direction, the Opposition would not accepteven these modest relaxations unless they resulted from a thorough, impartial and open examination of the issues involved.iie        To offer more than the Official 3ide proposals, by extending the &quot;intermediate&quot; group still further.    This was the course Ioriginally favoured in my letter of 9 September.    Eight of mycolleagues also thought it the best of the three options.    But it is open to the same objections as is the first option.iii. To meet the Staff Side&apos;s damands in full.    Three of mycolleagues were prepared to go this far.    But I have gravereservations, with most of my colleagues, about making sofundamental a change in the rules.    It would bring into doubt thepolitical impartiality of the Civil Service and could undermine the trust which is necessary between Ministers and their officials.However we went about it (except by way of an independent,committee of enquiry - and perhaps not even then), the agreementof the Opposition looks most unlikely,iv, An independent committee of enquiry to look into the wholequestion, along the lines of the Master man Committee which reported in 1949.    This is what the Staff Side now want.    It should enable us to refute any public criticism that we were foreclosingthe options prematurely.    There would be drawbacks.    It couldraise false hopes and might receive a great deal of public attention.There would be an implied commitment by the Government toaccept its recommendations - which could be unwelcome, * Areport which recommended unacceptable concessions and wasconsequently shelved could do more harm than good.    But this isno time to have a row with the Staff Side by refusing them an opendiscussion of restrictions which greatly irk them.6.        The Staff Side are also pressing for negotiations on the introductionof a post-entry union shop in the non-industrial Civil Service, an issue which raises some not dissimilar problems.    The proposed committee could consider this question also and the terms of reference below are sodrafted.    I have circulated a separate memorandum (C(76) 10) on thevery important considerations raised by the proposal for a post-entryunion shop in the Civil Service,
7.        I propose that a committee should be set up.    It should be chairedby a lawyer, preferably a Law Lord, and should have about a doaenmembers, including representatives of all three traditional political parties (though probably from the ranks of the retired).    Its terms ofreference would be as follows:&quot;To review the rules governing the active participation by civil servants in national and local political activities;&quot;To consider the implications for the Civil Service of theclosed shop principle in its various forms;&quot;And to make re commendation s &quot;,8.        We could hardly avoid committing ourselves in advance to publication of the Committee&apos;s Report.   But until we see what it says,we cannot decide what else we shall wish to do or how we should handle the matter.    Decisions on all this are unlikely to be needed beforemid-1977 at earliest.recommendation .        I recommend that we Bet up a committee along the lines I have proposed.civil Service Department5 February 1976\3
ANNEXPOLITICAL ACTIVITIES OP CIVIL SERVANTSThe Present RulesThe rules governing the political activities of civil servantsare set out in the Civil Service Pay and Conditions of ServiceCode, paragraphs 9923-9930.   These rules are based on theMasterman Report of June 1949* and were introduced in a white paper of March 1953.2.       Under the present rules, the Civil Service is dividedinto three groups: the &quot;politically free&quot; (all industrial and non-office grades); the &quot;intermediate&quot; (typists, ClericalAssistants, Clerical Officers, analogous grades and gradesparallel to Executive Officer); and the &quot;restricted&quot; (executive officer and above).3.       There are no restictions on the members of the &quot;politicallyfree&quot; group.   Members of the &quot;intermediate&quot; group are free to engage in local and national political activities withdepartmental permission.   Within this group, certain staff aregiven &apos;en bloc1 standing permission and are thereby freed fromthe need to seek permission individually.   Members of the&quot;restricted&quot; group are debarred from national political activities,but may seek departmental permission to engage in local political activities.The Staff Side*B proposals.      In July last year, reversing an earlier decision, theStaff Side decided to make a submission to the Royal Commissionon Standards of Conduct in Public Life.   Their evidence,submitted in August, proposed that the distinction between local and national political activities, and all restrictions basedon a civil servant1s grade, be abolished; and that the present1 -
rules should be replaced by a simple proviso that, before a civil servant takes an active role in political affairs ateither local or national level, he should be required to notifyhis intention to his department.   The department should thenbe given a period of one month within which it would be possiblefor them to argue that, because of the nature of the individual*position within the Civil Service, the proposed course ofaction would run counter to the public interest.    If thedepartment were to raise such objections, there would be provision for reference to adjudication by an independent bodyat which the individual could be assisted, should he so wish,by an adviser who might be a representative of his trade union.The object of the adjudication would be to determine whether ornot the public interest would be damaged by the proposedpolitical activities of the individual, taking account of the responsibilities carried by his post in the Civil Service.The Official Side&apos;s Offer5.      At the beginning of 1975 officials had suggested thatlimited relaxations might be acceptable to Ministers.   However,the Staff Side did not consider that what was envisaged wentfar enough.   These proposals were included in the official side&apos;s submission to the Salmon Commission; they consisted ofthe following relaxations:a. moving the Executive Officer grade from the&quot;restricted&quot; to the &quot;intermediate&quot; category (see paragraph 2)b. redefining the conditions applying to Clericals^t ,Q f&amp;e*rs9 Clerical Assistants and Typists (andanalogous grades) within the &quot;intermediate&quot; group,so that there would be known to be automatic freedomexcept in certain restricted posts, mainly those:     involving face-to-face contact with the public.
The Views of Members of the Cabinet6.       The Lord Privy Seal&apos;a letter of 9 September 1975 to theLord President of the Council, copied to the Prime Ministerand all members of the Cabinet, sought views on the possibilityof some liberalisation of the rules.   A third option was proposed, going beyond the Official Side*s offer but fallingshort of the Staff Side&apos;s proposals.   This was for a much widerextension of the scope of the &quot;intermediate&quot; group, allowingmany more of those at present debarred from so doing toundertake national political activities with permission.   the precise cut-off point was not specified, beyond the probability that it would have to be below Principal level.7.      No consensus of opinion emerged from the replies received.Only three Ministers were prepared to go as far as the staff side had proposed; the remaining replies were divided more orless equally between sticking to the limited concession already offered by officials and the option preferred by the Lord privy seal, involving the further extension of the &quot;intermediate&quot;group.   Of those who favoured this latter option,, three thoughtthat the cut-off point should be below Principal and four thatit should be below Senior Executive Officer level.The Royal Commission^ Decision8.       The Salmon Commission, after receiving written and oral evidence from the Staff Side and the Official Side, decided atthe end of October that it would not consider the political activities of civil servants on the grounds that the subject was too large, specialised and complex for it to accept within its remit.   When this decision became known, the secretary general of the National Staff Side then wrote to the Head ofthe Home Civil Service, urging once again the desirability ofreferring the subject tb a separate, specially-establishedcommittee along the lines of the Hasterman Committee.3   &apos;
The Views of the Opposition9.       The Leader of the Opposition was informed of the approach to the Salmon Commission and of the concessions previouslysuggested to the Staff Side by officials.   Mrs Thatcherindicated her wish to consult her colleagues and, afterSalmon^ decision had become known, replied that any further relaxation of the present rules, particularly changes assubstantial as those to be discussed, would be quiteincompatible with maintaining the impartiality of the CivilService.   Any procedure adopted following Salmon&apos;s decisions would only command the support of the Opposition if it ensureda thorough, impartial and open examination of the issues involved.
