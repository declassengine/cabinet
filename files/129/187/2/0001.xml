DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S government(76) 2 (Revise) COPY NO        8110 February 1976CABINETDIRECT ELECTIONS TO THE EUROPEAN ASSEMBLYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs and the Secretary of State forthe Home department. Cabinet last considered the question of direct elections to theEuropean Assembly at their meeting on 18 November (CC(T5) 49th Conclusion,Minute 3) in preparation for the meeting of the European Council in Romeon 1-2 December,    The Cabinet invited the Foreign and commonwealth secretary to bring the matter before them again at an appropriate time.We now recommend to our colleagues that the next step should be thepublication of the White paper circulated in draft with this memorandum.2.        The European Council agreed in Rome that direct elections to theEuropean Assembly should be held on a date in May or June 1978, but thatany country which was unable to meet this deadline should be able tocontinue to appoint its representatives to the Assembly.    It was made clear that there would be need for considerable consultation in the UnitedKingdom about arrangements and timing.    The European Council alsorequested the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) to continue their study of this question and to submit a report which would enable the text of aConvention to be finalised at the next meeting of the European Council.This meeting has now been set for 1-2 April.3.        The attached drait White Paper has been revised in the light ofcomments received from those who have been consulted, including thosecolleagues who have written to the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.The most important changes are the inclusion of a reference to NorthernIreland at the end of paragraph 4; the inausion of a sentence inparagraph 18 acknowledging the interest of Wales, Scotland, NorthernIreland and the regions in the level of their representation; the omission of references to a procedure for disqualification in paragraph 24c, since it does not now appear that there will be any provision concerning thismatter in the draft convention; the insertion of a new paragraph 27 dealingwith the legal form of the proposed Community Agreement; and an additionalsentence to what is now paragraph 31 referring to the question of links withthe United Kingdom Parliament.1
4a        The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary has already circulatedto members of the Cabinet a copy of the letter he sent to the political parties, in which he set out the general approach proposed for the white paper and offered to hold discussions with them either before or after thePaper was published.    He has received replies from all except for theScottish Nationalists.    Only the liberals asked for a meeting which he held with them last week.    The views put forward can be summarised aafollowsa. The Ulster Unionists reiterated their opposition to british membership of the European Economic Community (e.c.) and made it clear that they would oppose direct elections on principle.They added that their attitude towards such elections would beaffected by &quot;the undesirabflity of representatives of the sameelectorate being elected on different systems of election&quot;,b. Plaid Cymru argued that Wales should have her own voice in all the Community&apos;8 governing institutions including theEuropean Assembly,    They would however oppose directelections because they were opposed to the community is possible development into &quot;a strong continental etate&quot;, favouring instead&quot;a loose confederation of the nations and communities of Europe&quot;,If direct elections were to take place they would like to know howWelsh representation would compare with that of the smallermember states.c. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had a meeting with the Liberal Party on 3 February.    They had three main points to make.    They were ready to accept the European Assemblyisproposal for the composition of the Assembly but were anxious that the Government should consider the representation of Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland in relation to that for the small member states.    On the question of links with the United kingdom parliament they accepted that the dual mandate should be optionalbut stressed the need for some link, their own preference beingfor ex officio membership of the House of Lords.    On the electoral system they drew attention to the disadvantages of a&quot;first past the post&quot; system which, in their view, might so distortthe representation of minorities as to jeopardise public confidence in the European Assembly, and strongly urged that some form of proportional representation should be used.d. The Conservative Party noted the Governments intentionto publish a White Paper and said that there were no points thatthey wished to put to us at the present time.2
e.        The Organisation Sub-Committee of the National ExecutiveCommittee of the Labour Party has considered the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary^ letter, and also the InternationalSub-Committee.    Mr Underbill informs the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary that they will defer any comments untilthe White Paper is published.5. Subject to the agreement of our colleagues we would propose to publish the White Paper at the beginning of next week. We understand the Parliamentary Labour Party will wish to discuss the White paper before a debate takes place in the House. The Lord President will nodoubt advise us on the timing of this. There will be a further Councilof Ministers meeting on 1 and 2 March but the main discussion will takeplace at the E-iropean Council itself, which is to meet on 1-2 April.L J CR foreign and Commonwealth Office10 February 1976I3
annex draft WHITE PAPERDIRECT ELECTIONS TO THE EUROPEAN ASSEMBETINTRODUCTION1.        At present Members of the European Assembly are nominated by national Parliaments from among their members.   The Treaty ofSome provides in Article 138(3) (see Annex A) for the introductionof direct elections to the European Assembly.   No agreement wasreached during the first 18 years after the signature of the treaty to put Article 138(3) iate effect.   There is now a strong feeling in the Community that the time has come to do this.2.       HMG regard the introduction of direct elections as an import-ant matter.   Consultation with the political parties is already inprogress.   Debates in Parliament must precede any firm commitmentby the Government to any of the detailed arrangements for, or the timing of, the introduction of direct elections.   Thereafter, onceagreement has been reached on the questions which are to he decided by the Nine Member States, a Convention or Treaty will need to be signed and ratified and it will be necessary to introduce a billmaking provision for the holding of the elections.3.       This timing means that decisions will need to be taken at two different stages, first in the Community and then in the UnitedKingdom.   Part II of this Psper indicates the matters on which theGovernment will need to take a position in discussion with Commun-ity Governments and, subd*ot to consultation and debate, the posi-tion they propose to take.   It will be necessary for HMG to be ableto put forward British views on these issues in advance of thenext meeting of the European Council in April 1976.   Part III ofthe Paper briefly sets out the main questions which will fall tobe decided by the British Parliament when it comes to considerdraft legislation providing for direct elections to be held inthis country.   Decisions on Part III matters are not requiredimmediately.   Indeed some of them, such as the drawing of constituencies-uency boundaries, cannot be settled until after agreement has beenreached among the Nine on such questions as the number and distri-bution of seats in the new European Assembly.
4.     In considering this problem the Government have naturallyhad in mind the relationship between the question of directelections to the European Assembly and the creation of Scots and welsh Assemblies.   Their preliminary view is that the issues involved can and should be kept separate.   The timing   of direct elections would have to be consistent with the plans whichthe Government are considering for setting up Scots and WelshAssemblies.   Nor would the creation of Scots and Welsh Assembliesprevent or necessarily complicate the holding of directelections.   The Government will, however, at every stage ensurethat those who are working on the two questions remain in close touch in order to avoid any possible complications orconflicting arrangements.   The future system of government inNorthern Ireland is also a separate matter.   Again, directelections to the European Assembly should not cut across arrange-ments for the establishment or election of any new legislativebody in Northern Ireland./Pake i
PART ITHE PRESENT SITUATION5.       Article 138(1) of the Treaty of Rome provides that, for what was envisaged as an interim period, &quot;the Assembly shall consist of delegates who shall be designated by the respective Parliaments from among their members in accordance with the procedure laid down by each Member State&quot;.   This is the system at present used.   Article 138(3)provides for the introduction of a system of elections &quot;by directuniversal suffrage in accordance with a uniform procedure in all member States&quot;,6.       In 1960, the Assembly drew up and adopted a Draft Convention for direct Elections in accordance with Article 138(3).   This was not however acted on by the Council at the time, and for the followingfourteen years   there was disagreement on the subject among theoriginal members of the Community.   However, at the Heads of Governmentmeeting in Paris on 9 and 10 December 1974, seven of the Nine agreed,in the words of the Communique &quot;that the election of the european assembly by universal suffrage, one of the objectives laid down in theTreaty, should be achieved as soon as possible.   In this connection,they await with interest the proposals of the European Assembly, onwhich they wish the Council to act in 1976.   On this assumption,elections by direct universal suffrage could take place at any timein or after 1978&quot;.   The Prime Minister made it clear, as is alsorecorded in the Communique&quot;, that &quot;Her Majesty&apos;8 Government could not themselves take up a position on the proposal before the process of renegotiation had been completed and the results of renegotiationsubmitted to the British people&quot;.   The Danish Prime Minister alsoreserved his position as to the date for the introduction of direct elections.7.       The European Assembly duly produced new proposals in January 1975-These were in the form of a resolution embodying a draft convention which was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities(No. C32 of 11 February 1975) and which is summarized at Annex B.Heads of Government reverted to this question at the European council meeting in Brussels in July and Foreign Ministers were charged withexamining the problem, taking account of the proposals put forward by/the European Assembly
the European Assembly and of other relevant factors.     british officials took part in a Council Working Group set up for the purpose,on the clear understanding that the British Government had not yettaken up a position on any of the issues under consideration and thatthe purpose of the Group&apos;s work was to set out the options for political decisions by Ministers.8.     In the course of the Group&apos;s discussions it became clear thatthere exists a general recognition that the difficulties of reaching agreement between the Member Governments would be so great that itwould be unwise at this stage to try to implement Article 138(3) infull by attempting to lay down a uniform electoral procedure in allthe Member States.     The consensus is that as many questions as possible should be left to national decision, including the fundamental one ofthe electoral system to be used for each Member State.9.     Heads of Government had a further discussion of this questionwhen they met in Rome (as what is now called the European Council) on1/2 December 1975-     They agreed that elections to the European assembly should take place on a single date in May or June 1978, hut that any country which at that date is unable to hold direct elections should beallowed to continue to appoint its representatives from amongst themembers of its national parliament.     The Prime Minister made it clearthat the British Government accepted the Treaty commitment to theintroduction of direct elections, hut required a further period for internal consultations before adopting a position regarding the date ofthe first direct elections.     The European Council also instructed theCouncil of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) to continue its examination ofthe problems involved and to submit a report with a view to enabling the text of a draft Convention on direct elections to the European assembly to be finalised at the next European Council, which will takePlace in April 1976.     The Working Group began work in January on the text of the draft Convention and is to*su&amp;mit a further report.(References in this paper to views expressed in the Working Grouprelate mainly to the work done before the European Council in December.)THE TIMING OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS10.   HMG propose to play a full part in the preparation of the draftConvention for submission to Heads of Government at the next European/Council.
Council.     If the present aim of finalising the terms of the draftConvention at that Council issuccessfully achieved, a conference of representatives of the member states would probably be held shortly afterwards, at which theConvention could be signed.     Tbe Convention would inter alia Bakethe necessary modifications to the Community Treaties, for instance to Articles 158(1) and (2) of the Treaty of Rome.     The convention would then need to be submitted to national Parliaments prior to ratification in accordance with the respective procedures;of the member States.11.   Seven of the nine Member States have accepted a target date ofMay or June 1978 for the holding of the first direct elections.     HMGhave some doubts about the practicability of so early a date.     Allnine Member States will require time to decide upon, and makelegislative provision for, the arrangements to be followed in each country and it remains to be seen whether this work can be completed in time for the elections to be held on the target date.     HMG take theview that the necessary consultations and procedures must be carriedout in an orderly way and should not be rushed.     Nevertheless they believe that Parliament will wish the work to be completed with all reasonable speed.THE POWERS OS THE EUHOPEAB ASS31BLY12.   There axe at present no specific proposal., before the Councillor granting increased powers to the European Assenbly.

PART IIMATTERS FOR COMMUNITY DECISION13.     There is a general consensus within the Community that certainissues must be determined on a Community wide basis, of which the mostimportant are the size of the European Assembly, together with thedistribution of seats between Member States;   whether the electionsshould be held on the same day throughout the Community (or within afew days) or at the same time as national elections;   whether theAssembly should be elected for a fixed period (the Assembly havesuggested five years) and whether it should be a requirement that members of the European Assembly should also be members of nationalParliaments.   Until agreement has been reached on these, member governments and national Parliaments cannot take decisions on thematters which will fall to be decided nationally.1u.     In addition, the Working Group considered that agreement amongthe Nine would be necessary on such points as the banning of doublevoting and the establishment of a list of Community offices, the holders of which would not be eligible for&apos;membership of theEuropean Assembly.SIZE AND COMPOSITION OF THE EUROPEAN ASSEMBLY15.     The most difficult issue on which agreement among the Nine isrequired is the number and distribution of seats in the. new Assembly.At present it consists of 198 members including 36 British members(T.he full detailB of the composition of the present Assembly are setout in Article 138(2) at Annex A).   The Assembly^ draft Conventionproposes a larger Assembly pt 355 members of whom 67 would be fromthe UK.16.     The Assembly1e proposals allocate seats on the following basis:up to a population of 1 million, each State receives 6 seats,States with a population between 1 million and 2.5 millionare given 6 further seats,up to a population of 5 million, each State receives 1 furtherseat for each additional 500.000 inhabitants,for a population between 5 million and 10 million each Statereceived 1 further seat for each additional 750,000,A   for
for a population between 10 million and 50 million each state receives 1 further seat for each additional1 million inhabitants or part thereof,above 50 million, each State receives 1 further seatfor each additional 1.5 million inhabitants or part thereof.The resulting distribution of seats is shown in the summary ofthe Assembly&apos;8 proposals at Annex B.17*     During subsequent discussion between Member Governmentscertain Member States put forward alternative proposals for thesiae and distribution of seats in the Assembly, involving inone case a considerably smaller Assembly and in another a slightly larger one.   As regards distribution, one proposal wasaimed at making sure that there was not too great a reductionin the proportion of the total membership of the Assembly pro-vided for any of the new Member States as compared with theexisting situation.   Another proposal was put forward whichwould relate the distribution of seats between Member Statesmore strictly to the size of national populations,18.    All these proposals recognise that there is a need toensure a certain level of minimum representation for the smallerMember States, in particular Luxembourg.   At the present stage of the Community&apos;s development, a provision of this kind seemsessential.   All Member States, even those with a small population,Bust be represented in the Assembly.   On the other hand the rela-tionship between their representation and that of the constituent partsof the regions of the larger Member States cannot be disregarded.   it remains to be decided what the minimum number should be and the degree to which the remaining seats are distributed in proportion to the population.19.     The precise size of the directly elected Assembly and theallocation of seats between Member States will be the subject ofintergovernmental negotiation before the text of the Conventionscan be finalised.   The Governments own preliminary views are that an Assembly of about the sise put forward in the Assembly&apos;eown Convention would be acceptable, subject to paragraph 18 above.In considering the number of seats to be allocated to the UK andto other Community countries HMG will aim for a solution which,/given theJ
given the situation described above, tends as fax as possible in thedirection of relating the number of seats allotted to each country toits population.     The distribution of the UK allocation of seats willbe a matter for national decision (see para 3$ below).DATE FOR ELECTIONS20.   The European Assembly&apos;s draft Convention proposes that electionsshould take place on the same day throughout the Member States.     TheCouncil Working Group, however, considered two possibilities:    asingle date provided that this principle was interpreted flexiblyto take account of national customs by allowing voting to be completed in a short space of time, such as a given number of days;   alternativelythat elections to the European Assembly should take place on the flamedates as elections to national Parliaments.     Heads of Government atthe European Council in Rome came down in favour of the first alternative.     (The Prime Minister made it clear that the Governmentwould not be prepared to consider the holding of elections to theEuropean Assembly on a Sunday in the United Kingdom.)     On balance itseems best to have the whole European Assembly elected at the same time(ie within a few days to allow for different national traditions aboutthe appropriate day for voting) for a fixed period rather than electingeach country&apos;s delegation whenever there happen to be nationalelections.     There is much to be said for the Assembly having its owndistinct life-span, for if national groups are elected at differenttimes this would be likely to have an undesirable effect on the smoothfunctioning of the Assembly.     And it would be difficult for thepolitical parties to give due attention to the.European Assemblyelections if they were at the same time fighting a national election.The Government would, however, see advantage in holding the european assembly elections in May at the same time as local authorityelections if this can conveniently be arranged.21.   The question has arisen in discussions in Brussels, whether, if theelections are spread wut over three or four days, the results shouldbe declared throughout the Community on the same day, in order to makeit less likely that the results in one Member State might influence the voting in another.   ^ba practical aspects of this proposal will need further consideration.
32.   As regards the period for which the Assembly should be elected,HMG agree with the Assembly&apos;s proposal that it should be five years.There seems to be a broad consensus on this point in the Community.STATUS OF M31BERS OP THE EUROPEAN ASSEMBLY23.   An important issue which will fall to be considered in this category is the question of the so-called dual mandate, that is whethermembers of the European Assembly should at the same time be membersof national Parliaments (as is the case with the existing arrangements),whether they should be excluded from membership of national Parliaments,or whether it should be left to the discretion of individual membersif they wish to stand for election to both their national parliament and the European Assembly.     The existing arrangements impose a heavy burden on those Members who carry out seriously their responsibilitiesas members of national Parliaments and their responsibilities as members of the European Assembly.     This Is felt particularly severelyby members of the House of Commons who traditionally have close links with their constituencies and who devote a lot of their time toconstituency business.     As against that, however, the view has been expressed that it is desirable to maintain close links between thenational Parliament and the European Assembly.     The Government of denmark believe that they may wish to retain a compulsory dual mandatein Denmark.     But among other Governments there was a general consensusthat the dual mandate should be optional, ie that Members of parliament should be free to stand for the European Assembly if they wish and vice versa.     The Government shares this view.24.   Some other relatively minor points fall to be dealt with underthis heading, such as the immunities of members of the european assembly, confirmation of their credentials, and the procedure to befollowed for the disqualification of members.(a)     It will be necessary for members of the Parliament to enjoycertain privileges and immunities, but these should not extend beyond what is necessary for the performance of their tasks./(b)
(b) The Convention viU have to make some pro vie ion forthe confirmation of the credentials of directly elected members.   The general feeling in the Cornell Working Groupwas that If any dispute arose concerning the arrangementsfor the elect lone in any Member State, It should be for thecompetent national institution to deal with them.   In thecase of disputes eeneerning Community provisions these mightbe submitted to examination by a Community institution (theEuropean Assembly itself or the Buropean Court of Justice)or alternatively to the competent national authority, withthe possibility of appeals to the Buropean Court of Justiceor to the Buropean Assembly.(c) Arrangements will obviously have to be made for dealing with cases in which a member of the luropean Assembly loees hisseat between elections, eg by death or resignation,   given that the general consensus is that the electoral proceduresshould be governed by national provisions, it would seemreasonable that the provisions governing the disqualificationof Membere should be covered by domestic legislation.DOUBLE VOTING25.     The effect of a ban on double voting would be to preventnationals of one Member State who resided in another from voting in both States when the law allowed them to vote in either.   Ifthis principle is incorporated in the Convention, its applicationwould need to be examined in the context of our domestic measures(see part III below).ELIGIBILITY26.     In the course of their discussions, the Working Croupdistinguished between two types of &quot;incompatibility&quot; with member-ship of the Buropean Assembly, ie what oategories of persons wouldbe ineligible to stand for election:-   &quot;incompatibility&quot; arisingfrom national legislation, which would be left to the- discretion of each Member State, and &quot;Community incompatibility&quot;, which wouldAa
b* agreed at CommwnitT level.    The two Hate would applySimultaneouely.    The European Assembly&apos;s suggested list for&quot;Community incompatibility&quot; Is contained in Article 6 of thedraft Convention:   it provides that such functions as membership of the Government of a Member State, of the Commission of theEuropean Communities and a number ef ether official bodies of the Communities shall be incompatible with membership ef theEuropean Assembly.    the Government see no reason to objectto this proposal.LEGAL FORM27.    This paper refers to the agreement whioh it is proposed should be finalised at the next meeting ef the European council as a draft Convention.     This is in accordance with what theEuropean Assembly proposed and with discussion within theCommunity so far.     The possibility has however been raised thatthe agreement might mere properly be embodied in some etherform of Community Aot.     Ia any event HMG will ensure that theagreement is one which cannot come into force until ratified byall the member states in accordance with their respeotiTeconstitutional requirements.PROVISIONS FOR THE FUTURE28.     In their proposals, the Assembly set themselves the task of putting forward further proposals by 1980 for the introduction ofa uniform electoral procedure to complete the implementation ofArtiole 138(3).    No date was howerer set for the adoption ef sueha procedure by the Member States.    The difficulties of reaching agreement on a uniform procedure between the Member States, whohave widely different traditions in such matters, are likely toremain great.     The prospect 4* therefore that the provisions tobe established in the Convention will remain in fore,   for aconsiderable number of years.29.     It remains possible that it may in due course prove necessary for further provisions to be decided at Community levelin order to implement direct elections in accordance with theConvention.    The Assembly&apos;s draft proposes a procedure for thispurpose.     The precise drafting of any such provision will nodoubt be subject to further discussion./PART III
PART IIIMATTERS FOR DECISION BY THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT50.     It is proposed that it should be for the Government and parliament of each Member State to decide on their own electoralsystem and procedures.     From the discussions which have takenplace so far in the Community, it seems clear that aa many of the detailed arrangements as possible will, in fact, be left for national decision in this way.*1,     Legislation will be required to provide for all the essentialdetails of the electoral arrangements in this country.     This willbe preceded by full consultations between the parties and withthose who will be concerned with the organisation and conduct ofthe elections, and there will be ample opportunity for the detains to be debated in Parliament.   Ibis will also be the time to consider any proposals for ex official links between Parliament and the direotlyelected British members of the Suropean Assembly.32.   Certain adaptations to arrangements for Parliamentary electionswill be necessary, some of which are mentioned below,CONSTITUENCIES33.     It will be necessary to decide how the seats which areeventually allocated to the United Kingdom under the convention are to be distributed.    There will be many fewer constituenciesthan for Westminster, and they will be much larger.     The intentionwin be to maintain the electoral integrity of the several partsof the United Kingdom.34.     It would seem appropriate that in ordinary circumstances theParliamentary Boundary Commissions should be responsible for reviewing,and making recommendations about, the boundaries of the Assemblyconstituencies, in accordance with principles and procedures laid downin legislation.     But if the general Community view is in favour of holding the first elections in 1976 and Parliament concludes that theUnited Kingdom ought to participate at the same time, special arrangements for drawing the initial boundaries will probably be/needed
needed, and Parliament can consider in the legislation what arrangements should be made.FRANCHISE AND CANDIDATURE35.     The existing franchise for Parliamentary elections could, ingeneral, be maintained, with the addition of Peers.     Considerationcan be given to special extensions of the normal franchise, eg to nationals of the other Member States resident here, subject to the avoidance of double voting (see paragraph 25 above).36.     Subject to the provisions of the Convention about disqualificationon grounds of &quot;Community incompatibility&quot; (paragraph 26 above), itseems that the rules governing candidature for Westminster electioncould be adopted, though peers might in addition be eligible.CONDUCT OP ELECTIONS37. Some domestic arrangements will be needed to supplementCommunity procedures for announcing an Assembly election or a vacancy in the Assembly requiring a by-election.38.     Registers for the Assembly elections could be constructed onthe basis of the existing electoral canvass and Parliamentaryregisters, supplemented to cover any extensions in the franchiseand amalgamated to cover the new Constituencies.     There would be a consequential reallocation of responsibilities among returning officers.     Provisions on postal and proxy voting would be needed.35.     Because of the nature of the constituencies, special arrange-ments will have to be made for the conduct of the poll and of thecount; but the object will be to minimise expenditure by making asmuch use as possible of existing facilities and expertise.Uo.     Decisions will be needed on a number of other matters, such asthe appointment of returning officers for the new constituencies, thedeclaration of results, and the return of writs and accounts.     Sincethe elections will be conducted under national rules and procedures,/provision
provision will be required for the results to be made open to challenge in United Kingdom courts on grounds of electoralirregularities, whatever arrangements the Assembly may itselfintroduce for confirming the credentials of its Members.     Limitswill need to be fixed for candidates&apos; expenses.kl.     In addition, a number of new arrangements will need to bemade which do not involve legislation.     The political parties will presumably want to consider the local arrangements to bemade for the selection of candidates and handling the campaign.Appropriate provision will need to be made for broadcasting time.CONCLUSIONk2.     The Government have thought it right to bring beforeParliament at this stage the whole range of issues which arise in.relation to proposals for direct elections to the European Assembly.Subject to the views of Parliament, they propose to participate in firm decisions on the matters set out in Part II of the present paper at the March meeting of the European Council.     There is more time to prepare for decisions on the questions set out in Part III.These will fall to be settled when Parliament cornea to consider thenecessary legislation on which there will be full preliminaryconsultation and debate.
ANNEX ATREATY KSTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITYSome, 25 March 1957Article 138*The Assembly shall coneist of delegates who shall be designatedthe respective Parliaments from among their members in accordanceth the procedure laid down by each Member State.The number of these delegates shall be as followerBelgium	14Denmark	10Germany	36France	36Ireland	10Italy	36Luxembourg	6Netherlands	14United Kingdom	363.     The Assembly shall draw up proposals for elections by directuniversal suffrage in accordance with a uniform procedure in all member states.The Council shall, acting unanimously, lay down the appropriateprovisions, which it shall recommend to Member States for adoption inaccordance with their respective constitutional requirements.*As amended by Article 10 of the adjusted Act of Accession.
ANNEX BSUMMARY OF ASSEMBLY1S DRAFT convention the proposals put forward by the Assembly at the beginning of 1975(based on the Patijn report) were in the form of a draft Conventioncontaining, in addition to its preamble, 17 Articles.   The main features of this draft are as follows.NumbersThe Assembly would contain 355 members as compared with the presenttotal of 198.   Seats would be distributed as follows (existingdistribution in brackets):Belgium	23	04)Denmark	17	(10)Germany	71	(36)France	65	(36)Ireland	13	(10)Italy	66	(36)Luxembourg	8	(6)Netherlands	27	(14)UK	67	(36)lerm of office the draft Convention provides for representatives to be elected fora 5 year period, each outgoing parliament remaining in office untilthe first sitting of its sucoessor.Status of MembersRepresentatives are to vote on an individual and personal basisaccepting neither instructions nor any binding mandate.   on parliamentary immunities and eligibility to stand for election, thedraft Convention envisages that the provisions governing nationalelections should apply (though it would also be made incompatible with/Aitfembly
Assembly membership to hon office in the Community institutions orin the Government of a Member State).   Membership of the european parliament would be compatible with that of a national parliament(ie the Convention would neither make the so-called dual mandateobligatory nor rule it out).Electoral system the Assembly recognises the difficulty of going all the way to direct elections on a Community-wide uniform basis in one step asArticle 138(3) of the Rome Treaty envisages.   The draft Conventionprovides that the Assembly ehould put forward a proposal for a uniform electoral system by 1980.
