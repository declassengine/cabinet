C(76) 15COPY NO      o 416 February 1976 0 *CABINETREVIEW OF PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDUREMemorandum by the Lord President of the council.        We undertook in The Queen&apos;8 Speech to put forward proposals&quot;for a major review of the practice and procedure of Parliament&quot;.    On15 January, Cabinet discussed the scope and purpose of the review.There was general agreement that &quot;the time was ripe for a major reviewof the kind proposed&quot;.    I was invited to bring back specific proposals forthe conduct of the review after a debate in the House.2.        The House debated the question on 2 February.    There was virtuallyunanimous agreement from all parts of the House on the need for a far-reaching review along the lines I had indicated.    I now attach for considerstion by my colleagues draft terms of reference for a House of CommonsS-sleet Committee which will make possible the type of review we have inmind and which reflects the debate la the House,3.        During the debate on 2 February there was very marked oppositionto my suggestion that the Committee should include as full members a significant minority from outside the House.    I have therefore veryreluctantly come to the conclusion that with such opposition it is not\ practical to press *ids point further.    The terms of reference have,however, been drafted to allow the Committee to bring in outsiders in a&apos; way that will allow them to play as full as possible a part In the work of theCommittee, but without being full members of the Committee and without being *Me to vote.    Whether or not this power is used will be for theCommittee themselves to decide.4.        I invite my colleagues to agree to the establishment of a SelectCommittee with the terms of  reference proposed.E privy Council Office16 February 1976
