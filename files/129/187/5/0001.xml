COPY NO    0 iDEVELOPMENT LAND TAXMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer.        Two problems have arisen on Development Land Tax (DLT) onwhich the Ministerial Committee on Economic PoUcy was unable to reach any agreed conclusion.    The Committee have therefore invited me to put the issues to Cabinet for resolution.RATE OF DEVELOPMENT LAND TAX2.        In the White Paper &quot;Land&quot; (Cmnd. 5730) published in September1974 we announced our intention to introduce DLT.    Our aim is to moveaa soon as may oe to a situation in which the bulk of land for development would pass through the hands of local authorities, who would buy it at&quot;current use value&quot; (CUV).    Until that is achieved, private sectortransactions would take place at market value, but the purchase would besubject to DLT, while local authorities when ihey buy would pay the market value less DLT.3.        The White Paper said that the rate of DLT when first introducedwould be 80 per cent, rising eventually to 100 per cent.    The proposal which has now been put forward is that the initial rate of tax should be662/3 per cent, rising to 80 per cent after 2 years, and only at some laterpoint of time rising to 100 per cent.4. The arguments in favour of this change of policy may be summarisedas follows *-i.    The land market is currently very depressed.    DLT at80 per cent would provide a continuing strong disincentive tothe sale of land for housebuilding, because landowners would hold back from selling in the belief that *uch a high rate wouldin time be sure to be reduced either by the present Government(because the supply of land dries up and the scheme beeunworkable) or as a result of a change of Government.    Thiseould do serious damage to the Governments housing policy.A lower rate - cay 662/3 per cent - on the other hand would beseen as a level below which further reduction was unlikely andthis would remove one potential barrier to revival of the market in land.1C(76) 52 February 1976CABINET
ii.    It is never advisable to introduce a new tax at a high rate.It is rarely possible to get all the technical details right first time, so that after a year or two changes have to be made;the consequential anomalies are less serious if the initial taxrate is modest,iii. If, as suggested under i. the high rate would choke offtransactions- then a lower rate could in practice produce ahigher yield.iv. More peripherally, in opposition the Labour Party took astrong line on the need to protect the bondholders of the mersey Docks and Harbour Company, and their protection isin large part dependent on the Company being able to selldevelopment land at profitable prices.5.        The arguments in favour of leaving the present policy unchangedmay be summarised thus:-v. The Government is publicly committed to the 80 per concentrate; the introduction of a lower initial rate would be interpreted as a reversal of land policy, and would cast doubt on the intentionto move in the longer term to CUV as the normal basis for landsales.vi.     Local authorities benefit from the arrangement whereby theybuy at a price net of tax.    The reduction in the tax rate would reduce this benefit and could lessen their willingness to co-operate in the scheme.vii.    If the Government reduced the initial rate from the announced80 per cent to a lower figure, this would be interpreted, not as a level below which there was no question of going, but as a first step in a retreat, and landowners would therefore hold back fromselling.viii.     The 80 per cent rate would not in practice be as severe asit appeared, since the first  5, 000 of development valuerealised in a year would be free of tax, which would be animportant consideration in the numerous cases where the transaction involved only an acre or two of land for housebuilding.Some further mitigation might be achieved by increasing thisexemption, eg to  7,500.ix.    Any potential damage to the Government*s housing policiescould be mitigated by raising the normal density for private housing of 10-11 houses to the acre nearer to the local authorityaverage of 15 to the acre.A separate paper by the Minister for Planning and Local Governmentenlarges upon the points in the last two sub-paragraphs.2
6.        I invite my colleagues to conaider whether, in the light of these considerations,, ttev agree that the initial rate of DLT should be80 per cent or some lower figure.ROLL-OVER RELIEF7.        Under Capital Gains Tax and Development Gains Charge, wherea farmer or an industrialist makes a capital gain through the sale of landor buildings, he can defer payment of the whole or part of the tax in so faras the proceeds aie used to buy new equipment and buildings (not bareland).    The process may be repeated indefinitely on subsequent sales of the new assets as long as further equipment or buildings are againacquired with the proceeds.    Only when an asset is sold and She proceedsnot oo used does the gain arising from the whole series of transactionsbecome chargeable to tax.8.        The question for consideration now is: should the limited form ofroll-over relief given under Development Gains Charge be applied toDLT?   It had not previously been envisaged that it would.    The arguments in favour of doing so are:-x.    Development gains are an important source of capital forthe farming industry.xi.    More marginally, development gains are of importance to industry in canes where a firm, perhaps under pressure fromthe Government, is considering moving from eg, a valuable citycentre site to a development area.    In such cases the availability of this relief could sway the decision.9.        Against this there are the following points:-xii.    Such reUef would reduce the Exchequers receipts fromthe tax and would increase the price local authorities wouldhave to pay for the land, although it is not possible to quantifythe extent of this.xiii. Because the tax liability would be dependent on the use towhich the vendor elected to put the proceeds, the arrangementsfor net-of-tax purchaseb by local authorities would be more complicated and there would be a period of uncertainty, perhapsprolonged, for the authorities in which they would not know whatthe price would be.xiv. Roll-over relief is incompatible with the concept of a flat-ratetax on land, rather than a tax related to the circumstances of theseller, and conceding it here would make it difficult to resistpressures for other departures.3
xv.    DLT is not intended to be a continuing tax - for which suchrelief might be appropriate - hxxt ?.a simply an interim arrangement to bridge the period until the time when all local authoritypurchases would be at CUV.    (How long this interim period willlast must, however, be a matter of judgment.)10.       I invite my colleagues to consider whether, in the light of these points they think roll-over relief should be applied to DLT,CONCLUSION11.       The Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy were divided on both of these issues.    The problem on the rate of tax is one of politicaljudgment: which course will best serve the Government&apos;s policyobjectives on land (to move as soon as may be to a position where alldevelopment land passes through local authorities at CUV) and on housing(not to deter the provision of houses wherever needed)?   Would a highinitial rate threaten the housing programme?   Would a lower initial ratemilitate against the transition to a 100 per cent rate?   And would it, ifinterpreted as a retreat on land policy, make it more difficult to secure acceptance of a continuance of incomes policy?    These are the issuesmy colleagues will wish to weigh.12.       The question of relief raises less broad issues, but the interestsof agriculture and icduetry run counter to a number of philosophical orpractical considerations; and the decision turns to some extent on howbrief a life-span is envisaged for DLT - which must of course depend on what actually happens in the next few years.D W treasury Chambers2 February 19?64
