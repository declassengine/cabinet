Part future Gvil Aviation policy. In his statement to Parliament of 29 July 19751 the Secretary of Statefor Trade drew attention to the severe setback which the airline industry world-wide had suffered as a result of the oil crisis and the consequent economicrecession. Traffic carried by UK airlines fell by about 10 per cent in 1974 andalthough there were some signs of recovery during 1975, current forecastssuggest that for the rest of this decade the main markets served by UK airlineswill be expanding much more slowly than they were during the 1960s and early 1970s. This forecast of siow growth contrasts sharply with the outlook for the industry foreseen by the Edwards Committee in its report published in1969&apos;, which envisaged that traffic would go on increasing rapidly throughoutthe 1970s.2. The Edwards Committee had concluded that, even though markets were likely to be rapidly expanding, there would be only limited scope for &apos;doub!edesignation&apos; of British airlines on international routes (ie competition between british airlines on the same route). Nevertheless, the belief that on some majorroutes double designation would be desirable was one of the main reasons which led the Committee to recommend that a strong &apos;second force&apos; airlineshould be set up. In the two years following the establishment of BritishCaledonian Airways (BCAL) to act as this *second force&apos;, BCAL was givenlicences to operate scheduled services on a number of long-haul routes already being served by British Airways (BA). BCAL began services on two of these routes, to New York and Los Angeles, in April 1973, but discontinued themin November 1974. The other double designation long-haul routes for whichit continues to hold licences are London-Toronto and London-Bahrain-Singapore. In addition, Laker Airways was licensed in 1972 to operate a&quot;Skytrain&apos; service between London (Stansted) and New York.3. The failure of BCAL&apos;s attempt to establish itself in the North Atlanticscheduled market in the difficult circumstances of 1973-74 showed that itwas already highly questionable whether a policy of double designation could still be expected to enable British airlines to secure and retain a larger shareof major intercontinental markets. At that time, it had still been possible forBCAL to introduce their New York and Los Angeles services without anycorresponding reduction being required in the capacity mounted by BA.BCAL, however, had found it impossible to achieve profitability in the face offierce competition from established national flag carriers. More recent develop-ments have weakened even further the case for double designation. There isnow virtually no major long-haul route on which it would be possible tointroduce a second British airline on terms which would leave any scope forthe British share of the total earnings from the route to be increased.4. All the United Kingdom&apos;s bilateral Air Services Agreements provide forsome restraint to be placed on the capacity to be mounted by the airlines ofthe two sides and on competition between them. The interpretation andimplementation of these restraints has been increasingly tightened up over the&apos; HC Deb 1975 896 29 July c 1502-1505.* &quot;British Air Transport in the Seventies&apos; Comd. 4018.
past few years and there are now very few countries which are prepared toallow unfettered competition by British airlines with their own. In most casesunderstandings have been reached (either between the governments or, withtheir concurrence, between the airlines) which determine the capacity to bemounted by both sides. Many countries are unwilling, for political or policyreasons, to allow more than one foreign airline to compete with their nationalflag carrier on a given route. Others might be prepared to agree to dualdesignation by British airlines, but only in return for some major concession to their own airline industry.5. Under these circumstances it would generally only be possible to establishor maintain services by a second British scheduled airline by accepting acorresponding reduction in the capacity of the first. This would usually leadto higher costs and lower profitability for both airlines, and there would beno increase in the British share of the market.6. Even on routes to the USA across the Atlantic where competition between British and American airlines has in the past usually been unrestricted-the situation has changed dramatically in the past few years. In 1968 and 1969IATA member airlines made substantial profits from their North Atlanticservices. But since 1971 there have been repeated losses. In 1973 these lossestotalled  160 million and in 1974 they increased still further to  300 million.Both the United States and United Kingdom governments concluded that the excess of capacity over demand which existed in 1973 and 1974 was wastefulof resources, damaging to the finances of the airlines, and contrary even to theinterests of passengers. Accordingly, with the encouragement and support ofboth governments, the airlines concerned have introduced arrangements fortailoring capacity more closely to demand. Without these arrangements the substantial increases in fares that have taken place in the last two years wouldhave had to be even larger. In the view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, it willbe desirable to maintain capacity agreements along these lines for the fore-seeable future. This must, however, mean that the introduction of a secondBritish airline, on a route even to the United States, could now only be achieved at the expense of BA through an equivalent reduction in the capacity theyoperate.7. These considerations led the Secretary of State for Trade to announceon 29 July 1975 that he had decided that in future it should be the generalpolicy not to permit competition between British airlines on long-haul scheduled services and therefore not to license more than one British airline on any givenlong-haul route. He recognised that this decision would prevent BCAL fromreturning to the North Atlantic scheduled market and from mounting scheduled services to Toronto or Singapore. He emphasised, however, that he wantedBCAL to continue as a scheduled carrier on major routes, so as to retain asecond centre of airline expertise in the UK. He also stressed his anxiety todo -what he could to help to make more secure the jobs of the substantial numbers of workers who depend on BCAL for their livelihood.8. At present, BCAL*s main long-haul scheduled services are operated to west Africa and South America. BCAL is the only British scheduled airlineserving these countries. But in addition, BCAL also operates scheduled services
to East and Central Africa and the Seychelles in competition with BA and provides an &quot;exempt charter&apos; service to Singapore. This remaining competition between BCAL&apos;s and BA&apos;s long-haul services involves both airlines in awasteful use of resources which outweighs any possible advantage to the travelling public. Accordingly, discussions have taken place with the two airlinesin order to explore whether a limited exchange of routes could be arrangedwhich would consolidate BCAL&apos;s and BA&apos;s &quot;spheres of interest&apos; and be ofbenefit to both. Account has also been taken in these discussions of the benefitBA will derive from the Government^ decision to rule out double designationon long-haul routes in the future and the consequent loss to BCAL of theirpresent licences to serve New York, Los Angeles (via Chicago), Boston (en route to Atlanta or Houston), Toronto and Bahrain/Singapore.9. It has now been decided that East Africa and the Seychelles will be partof the BA sphere of interest and Central Africa (including Zambia) part ofBCAL&apos;s sphere. In South America, BCAL&apos;s sphere will be extended and it willtake over from BA responsibility for services to Venezuela, Colombia andPeru. BCAL will discontinue its exempt charter services to Singapore, as wellas giving up the &quot;double designation&apos; licences listed in the previous paragraph.It will, however, retain its licence to serve Atlanta and Houston and it will bethe sole British airline designated to operate this route when it becomes availablefor international services.10. The exchange of routes in Africa should enable both airlines to achieveconsiderable cost savings through deploying their resources more effectively.BA will be able to increase substantially their revenue from the route to EastAfrica and the Seychelles from which BCAL&apos;s earnings on passenger services were about  3J million in 1974-75. Similarly, BCAL will be able to secure asignificantly higher share of the London/Central Africa market, from whichBA earned nearly  3 million in 1974-75.11. Outside Africa, BA will benefit from the ending of BCAL&apos;s exemptcharter services to Singapore (which earned revenue of nearly  2 million in1974-75, though their frequency has since been reduced) and, more importantly,from the withdrawal of BCAL&apos;s &quot;double designation&apos; licences. BA will now beable to plan the development of their services on these major routes free fromthe apprehension that BCAL might in due course wish to exercise its licences,thus reducing BA&apos;s market share and probably obliging them to cut back their capacity under capacity-sharing agreements. The gain to BA cannot be preciselyquantified, since much would have depended on future market conditions and competitive circumstances, hut it wul clearly be large. BCAL, for its part, willhave scope for its future expansion through the addition to its existing network of the new route to Atlanta and Houston, from which it estimates that it couldbe earning revenue of almost  10 million (in 1974-75 prices) by 1979-80;and of the route to Venezuela, Colombia and Peru (which should in due course be capable of extension to Ecuador). BA earned revenue totalling  3.8 million from these three South American points in 1974-75.12. The Government believe that the re-arrangement of routes nowannounced is fair to both airlines and will provide a firm and stable basis onwhich both can plan for their future development, so strengthening their
ability to compete with foreign carriers in the very demanding world aviationmarket. Each will now have a clearly defined sphere of interest for their long-haul services. As a result, these services will in future be complementary ratherthan competitive and the way will be open for much closer co-operationbetween British Airways and British Caledonian Airways in all aspects of their business, from engineering and maintenance to marketing and sales. The twoairlines have agreed that they should hold continuing discussions at seniormanagement level to examine all possible means of strengthening collaboration between them to their mutual benefit. The Government regard this as an encouraging development.Concorde13. In establishing these spheres of interest for BA and BCAL, the Govern-ment have borne in mind that it is of national importance that BA should beable to deploy their Concorde fleet effectively. BA*s present plans are to intro-duce Concorde services on routes within their own sphere of influence to new York, Washington, Melbourne (via Bahrain and Singapore) and Tokyo.The Government are confident that the necessary international understandingscovering Concorde operations on all these routes will be obtained in due course. It is, however, desirable in the Secretary of State&apos;s view to leave open the possibility that a Concorde service might be introduced at some stage toone or more destinations in the BCAL sphere of interest. BCAL might itselfprovide such a service, by arrangement, with BA. But the Government^ decisionto rule out double designation on long-haul routes would not, in itself, preventBA from introducing such a service alongside BCAUs subsonic service. before giving BA the necessary licence, however, the Civil Aviation Authority wouldhave to satisfy itself that adequate arrangements were being made to alleviateany adverse effects on BCAL.Skytrain14. The Secretary of State has also considered carefully whether LakerAirways&apos; proposed Skytrain service between London and New York shouldbe allowed to go ahead as an exception to the Governments general policyof ruling out double designation on long-haul routes. He has taken accountof the fact that a wide range of charter services and of promotional fares onscheduled services has been developed in the past few years, so that there would now be much less scope than was originally envisaged for Skytrain-type services to generate new traffic by attracting potential passengers not already cateredfor by existing low-fare services. It follows that a substantial proportion ofthe traffic that Skytrain services might carry would be diverted from otherexisting services. But in current and foreseeable economic conditions the damage that would be done to existing services would be unacceptable. as has been explained in paragraph 6, arrangements have been introduced withthe approval of both the United Kingdom and United States Governments to rationalise capacity on routes between the two countries. The introduction ofSkytrain could jeopardise the continuation of these arrangements. At the veryleast, the United States Government would almost certainly insist that ifLaker Airways&apos; Skytrain service was introduced, a US airline should be per-mitted to mount a competing service. Her Majesty&apos;s Government estimate that BA would incur losses of about  6 million a year if the Laker Skytrain
and one corresponding US service were to be operated. Moreover, the neteffect on the UK balance of payments would be likely to be minimal or evenadverse.15. The Secretary of State has accordingly decided that Laker Airways&apos;designation as a scheduled service operator under the United Kingdom/UnitedStates Air Services Agreement should be cancelled. The Skytrain licence willbe dealt with in accordance with paragraph 7 of the new Policy Guidance.Revised Policy Guidance16. The policy changes which the Secretary of State announced on 29 July1975, and which have been explained further above, will require certain changes to be made in the Policy Guidance given to the Civil Aviation Authority inaccordance with Section 3(2) and (3) of the Civil Aviation Act 1971. Theexisting Guidance was set out in a White Paper (Cmnd 4899) presented toParliament by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in February1972 and subsequently approved by both Houses. Part II of the present white paper contains the revised Guidance which the Secretary of State for Trade,after consultation with the Authority, now proposes to give.17. The approval of both Houses for these proposals will be sought in due course and it will then be the Authority*s duty to follow this new Guidance.The new Guidance continues to be expressed in general terms and to allow the Authority the necessary measure of discretion. It will remain the Authority&apos;stask to work out the detail and apply it to particular cases. In any case thatcomes to him on appeal, the Secretary of State will uphold the Authority&apos;decision unless there is clearly a substantial reason for departing from it.18. In drawing up his present proposals, the Secretary of State&apos;s aim hasbeen to avoid making unnecessary changes. In the Governmenfs view, theindustry requires reasonable stability in the policy framework governing its operations if it is to be able to carry out effective long-term planning and soto maintain and strengthen its competitiveness in the world aviation market.The Secretary of State has decided that it is not necessary to seek to amend the Civil Aviation Act 1971. He considers that the new Guidance which heis now proposing should, if approved, remain substantially unchanged for aconsiderable period of years.19. The main differences between the Secretary of State*s present proposals and the existing Guidance are explained in paragraphs 20 to 28 below.20. Paragraph 16 of the existing Guidance presupposes that double design a-tioa of British airlines on domestic and international routes is in principledesirable and indicates that the Authority should license more than one Britishairline to serve the same scheduled service route wherever it is satisfied thatcertain conditions are likely to be met. For the reasons explained above theSecretary of State considers that double designation on long-haul routes must now in general be ruled out. Thus paragraph 7 of the proposed new Guidancewould, if approved, provide that tie Authority should not license more thanone British airline to provide scheduled services on any long-haul route. Theonly exceptions to this general rule are set out in paragraph 8, the main effectof which would be to allow double designation for the operation by a secondairline of a Concorde service.
21. Similarly, paragraph 9 would largely rule out double designation on short-haul international routes. Here, however, an exception would be madefor services to and from airports in the London area. The Secretary of Stateconsiders that for certain short-haul flights Heathrow and Gatwick can beregarded as serving distinct catchment areas and that a choice of airport forsuch services can be of substantial benefit to the passenger. Accordingly, theAuthority would, for example, be able to consider applications to provideservices from Gatwick to short-haul destinations already served from Heathrow(or to provide services from Heathrow to destinations already served fromGatwick). But paragraph 9 of the new Guidance would require the Authority,before granting such an application or allowing more than one airline toserve any domestic route, to satisfy itself that certain conditions, for example asregards profitability, are likely to be met.22. The existing Guidance, especially paragraph 17, requires the Authorityto give preferential treatment to BCAL in order to help it to develop its routenetwork. The Secretary of State does not consider it desirable that BCALshould continue to enjoy such treatment in circumstances in which as explained above it would usually only be possible to favour BCAL at the direct expenseof BA. Instead, paragraph 7 of the new Guidance would establish a sphere ofinterest for BCAL&apos;s long-haul scheduled services, and a separate sphere ofinterest for BA. The Authority would be required to give BCAL and BA astrong preference within their respective spheres of interest. The Secretary ofState expects that it would be only in quite exceptional circumstances, if at all,that the Authority would grant to another airline, against the objection of thepreferred airline, a licence to provide a long-haul scheduled service.23. Paragraph 17 of the present Guidance also requires the Authority togive BCAL a measure of preference over all other airlines in allocating licences for non-scheduled services, when the number or capacity of British airlinesneed for the time being to be restricted. The Secretary of State does not considerthat it would be appropriate for BCAL to continue to receive such a preferencethroughout the world. BCAL has, however, built up a considerable business in charter operations, both passenger and freight, and its success as an airlinedepends to a substantial extent on its ability to maintain and expand thisbusiness. Accordingly paragraph 10 of the new Guidance would require theAuthority to give BCAL preference on non-scheduled services within itssphere of interest. As BA&apos;s sphere of interest is much more extensive thanBCAL&apos;s, to give BA preference on non-scheduled services throughout it couldrestrict undesirably the opportunities available to other British airlines,especially in the important North Atlantic charter market. The Secretary ofState considers, however, that it would be right to accord BA preference on non-scheduled services within those parts of Africa included in their sphere of interest, particularly so as to enable BA to build up charter as well asscheduled services in the East African market, from which BCAL will bewithdrawing in accordance with the decisions on route rationalisation set outin paragraph 9 above. Such preference for BA is therefore provided for inparagraph 10 of the new Guidance.24. The Authority submitted recommendations to the Secretary of State inFebruary 1974, in fulfilment of its remit under paragraph 21 of the existingGuidance which required it to examine the economics and organisation of air
services and of its own aerodromes and air navigation services in theScottish Highlands and Islands. The principal services to and from the highlands and Islands are provided by BA and the application of the newGuidance will ensure that this situation continues. There is, however, animportant role for the operator of local or &apos;third-level&apos; services in this area,some of which, while being essential to the life of the communities they serve,are nevertheless inherently unprofitable. Loganair Limited, which has consider-able experience of this type of operation, is for the time being receiving financialassistance from the Secretary of State for Scotland under Section 21 of theScottish Development Agency Act 1975 towards maintaining certain of these services.25. Paragraph 29 of the present Guidance sets the Authority the financial objective of recovering, as soon as possible, the whole of its costs and earninga return on capital reasonable in relation to the nature of its activities andprevailing commercial standards. The Authority has made good progress towards its goal of recovering its costs from its customers, and is also makingevery effort to improve the efficiency of its operations and so to contain costs.Although because of inflation it has required increasing amounts of grant fromthe Government from year to year, it has financed an increasing proportionof its expenditure from revenue. Schemes are now in operation covering mostof the Authority&apos;s activities and the Government is satisfied that it should bepossible-without imposing an undue burden on the industry for the Authorityto be recovering its costs by 1978 in all but two areas. In the case of the airportswhich the Authority at present owns in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland,and whose future remains under discussion, the Government accepts that before the end of 1977-78 steps will need to be taken to put the financing ofthese operations on a new basis. The other activity in respect of which revenuewill not match costs by this date is the provision of en route navigation services,other than in the Shanwick Oceanic Control area. The cost of operating these services amounts to over half of the Authority&apos;s total expenditure, and charges are agreed by the Member States of euro control jointly. Current arrangements are for the recovery of 60 per cent of the costs incurred some two yearspreviously, but the cost-basing formula is to be revised in 1977 and the rateincreased to 75 per cent in 1978. The Authority, whose officers normallyrepresent the Government at euro control meetings, will be expected to continueto work for the recovery in full of costs as they are incurred.26. Paragraphs 13 and 14 of the new Guidance bring out more clearly theimportance of airports in the development of civil aviation policy. They reflect the consultations which are proceeding concurrently on the development of anairports strategy for Great Britain and the role of the Civil Aviation authority in this work. Specifically the revised Guidance emphasises the need for theAuthority in carrying out its duties to have regard to the Government^ airportsstrategy as it evolves, to maintain continuing close liaison with the british airports Authority and with other airport authorities, and to promote the build-up of traffic at Gatwick.27. Paragraph 17 of the new Guidance reflects the resolve of the Governmentand the Civil Aviation Authority to work together to ensure that approvedtariffs and other conditions are observed by airlines, and to stamp out mal-practices which are damaging to the airlines and the public alike.

Part IIThe GuidanceGeneral1. Civil air transport exists by serving the public; the Authority should inform itself of the public&apos;s needs and take full account of them. The authority should seek to maximise the opportunities for the industry profitably toincrease its share of the world civil air transport market. Within the frameworkprovided by this Guidance, and within the limitations affecting internationalservices, the Authority should aim always to impose the least restraint uponthe industry or upon the users of its services. It should encourage the provisionof profitable services by British airlines that will foster the development of theUnited Kingdom&apos;s trade and tourism and strengthen the balance of payments.It should continue to keep in mind the needs of general aviation includingflying schools and clubs.Air Transport Licensing2. The Authority should seek to ensure that the scale and character of theoperations of British airlines are within their skills and resources. In exercisingits air transport licensing powers and particularly in regulating or advising onthe fares and rates to be charged, the Authority should also seek to ensureso far as possible that efficient British airlines in both the public and private sectors have the opportunity to operate profitably so as to justify the rate ofcapital expenditure necessary for the maintenance and development of their services.3. In allocating air transport licences the Authority should also considerthe suitability of particular airlines to engage in particular types of operations and the pattern of routes and operations which will bring the greatest benefitto the public and the industry.4. Except to the extent indicated in the following paragraphs, the authority should not reserve any particular type of operation exclusively to any airline orclass of airlines, although the entry of additional airlines into particular types of operations may need to be controlled in order to avoid undue fragmentationof effort. Subject to paragraphs 6 to 10 below, airlines should be given theopportunity of allocating their resources flexibly as between one type of serviceand another in line with the development of the market.5. The Authority should further the maintenance and development, where asubstantial demand exists or may be expected, of a viable network of scheduled services, catering particularly for those who need a wide and flexible range ofair transport facilities, consistently and readily available. Subject to para-graphs 6 to 10 below, restrictions on the provision of different types of serviceboth scheduled and non-scheduled and on their users should be kept to theminimum necessary to ensure that all substantial categories of demand can hesatisfied profitably by efficient airlines.1 In this Guidance references to &apos;British airlines&apos; have the same meaning as in Section 3(1)of the Civil Aviation Act 1971 and references to &apos;the industry&apos; are to be taken as referring to such airlines and to holders of air travel organisers&apos; and aerodrome licences.
6. British Airways should remain the principal providers of scheduled services.British Caledonian Airways should continue to be the principal independentscheduled airline. The Authority should seek to ensure that these airlines have adequate opportunities to compete effectively in the world civil air transportmarket. For this reason the Authority will need to limit the grant to other british independent airlines of licences to serve international scheduled routes.7. In the case of long-haul scheduled services (ie services between the UnitedKingdom and points outside the areas to which paragraph 9 applies) theAuthority should not, except as provided for in paragraph 8, license morethan one British airline to serve the same route. British Caledonian Airwaysshould be the preferred airline for routes between the United Kingdom and itssphere of interest as defined in Annex A to this Guidance, while british airways should be the preferred airline for all other long-haul routes. It isthe intention that, even in the case of long-haul routes not already beingoperated by the preferred airline, the Authority should only in quite exceptional circumstances grant to another airline, against the objection of the preferredairline, a licence to provide a long-haul scheduled service. Accordingly, theAuthority should so license an airline other than the preferred airline only ifit is satisfied that a substantial demand exists, that the service could be operatedprofitably, that the preferred airline would not itself be likely to mount anadequate service on the route concerned within a reasonable period, and thatgranting the licence would not conflict with the provision in paragraph 5 aboveconcerning the maintenance and development of a viable network of scheduled services. The Authority should review existing licences and exemptions in thelight of this paragraph and take appropriate action.8. Nothing in paragraph 7 should, however, prevent the licensing of:(a) any British airline to serve a long-haul route with Concorde aircraft(but where the airline seeking to operate Concorde is not the preferredairline for that route within the meaning of paragraph 7, the authority should satisfy itself that adequate arrangements are made to alleviateany adverse effects upon the preferred airline); or(b) British Caledonian Airways or another British airline to provide ascheduled service within British Airways&apos; sphere of interest as defined by paragraph 7, provided British Airways has given its consent; or(c) British Airways or another British airline to provide a scheduled servicewithin British Caledonian Airways&apos; sphere of interest as defined by paragraph 7, provided British Caledonian Airways has given its consent.9, In considering applications for licences to provide scheduled services on short-haul international routes (ie services between the United Kingdom andpoints within Europe and North africa) or on domestic routes the authority should have particular regard to paragraphs 1 to 4 above and should take full account of the effects that the introduction of a new service might have on theoperation of scheduled services by British airlines generally, including any possible diversion of traffic from their services, particularly long-haul services.1 For the purposes of paragraph 9, &apos;Europe and North Africa&apos; shall be understood to mean the whole of Continental Europe (excluding the USSR), the Irish Republic, Iceland,the Mediterranean islands, add Morocco.
The Authority should not, in general, license more than one British airline toprovide scheduled services on any individual short-haul international routeother than a route to and from London. In considering applications for licences to serve such routes to and from London or to serve domestic routes, theAuthority should license an additional British airline to serve the same routeonly if it is satisfied that:(a) the traffic is likely to be sufficient to support competing services byBritish airlines profitably within a reasonable time; and(b) the choice and standard of service available to the public are likely tobe improved, particularly as regards the choice of airport in the london area;and also in the case of an international route that:(c) satisfactory arrangements have been made or are likely to be madewith the other country or countries concerned for the introduction ofa second British airline on the route.The Authority should make public the factors it will take into account in applying this paragraph.10. The Authority should give to British Caledonian Airways within itssphere of interest as defined in Annex A to this Guidance other than Madeira,the Canary Islands, the Azores, Algeria and Tunisia, and to British Airways,within those parts of Africa covered by paragraph 7 and not included in BritishCaledonian Airways&apos; sphere of interest, preference in allocating licences fornon-scheduled passenger flights and, in any case where the number or capacityof British airlines need for the time being to be restricted, for non-scheduledfreight flights. The Authority should, however, in every case take account also of the considerations in paragraphs 1 to 4 and the effect of its decisions on thedevelopment of other airlines; it is not the Government^ intention that anypreference within the meaning of this paragraph should be automatic orcomplete. Where no preference applies, the Authority should seek to affordBritish Caledonian Airways and British Airways the same opportunities as other British airlines to operate non-scheduled services.11. The Authority should inform itself of commercial and pooling agree-ments as a basis for its own decisions and for its advice to the Secretary ofState.12. It is the intention that the main provisions of this Guidance, particularly those contained in paragraphs 6 to 10 above, should remain substantially unchanged for a considerable period of years, in order to provide increasedstability for the industry^ long-term planning and development. Subject to this,however, the Authority should, when circumstances warrant, examine with theBritish airlines concerned the scope for adjusting, exchanging or reallocatingroutes so as to increase the benefit to those airlines and to the travelling publicthrough greater efficiency or through wider choice. In so doing the authority should have particular regard to such Government policy in respect of airportsas may from time to time apply.Airports Policy13. The Authority should advise the Secretary of State and others concerned as to the provision and development of aerodromes to match the developmentof air services and general aviation.
14. The Authority should act in pursuit of such Government policy onairports as may from time to time apply and should maintain a close workingrelationship with the British Airports Authority. In particular, the authority should seek to promote the development of scheduled services to and fromGatwick, especially through expansion of the range of connecting servicesavailable there.Regional, Economic and Social Development15. The Authority should take account of the contribution which bathinternational and domestic air services may make to regional, economic and social development in the United Kingdom and should have regard to theparticular interests of the Channel Islands and Isle of Man when regulatingair services to or among them. The Authority should encourage the maintenance and development of an adequate range of services to meet the needs of theScottish Highlands and Islands and give such advice as the Secretary of Statefor Scotland may require in connection with the provision of financial assistanceto an airline operating such services. In regulating domestic air services, theAuthority should take account of existing and planned facilities for travel byalternative means and bear in mind the desirability of avoiding unprofitableduplication of transport services.Pricing16. To the extent that the fares and rates for air transport or for holidays by air need to be controlled, either because of the United Kingdom&apos;s international relations or for the reasons stated in paragraphs 2 and 5, the Authority should seek to secure tariff provisions and associated conditions that are rational,simple and enforceable. As a guiding principle for the longer term, each charge should be related to costs at a level which will yield sufficient revenue to cover the costs of efficient operators, including an adequate return on capital. this does not for example preclude the cross-subsidisation of new services which arebeing developed, or differential pricing that reflects differences in the cost of producing particular facilities or which is designed to reduce wide fluctuations in demand; but the Authority should keep pricing structures under review soas to promote the sound allocation of resources. The Authority should also have regard to such Government policy on prices as may from time to timeapply.Enforcement17. The Authority should seek to ensure that approved tariffs and other conditions are observed by British airlines and should assist the Secretary ofState in securing their observance by foreign airlines on services into or out ofBritish territory.International Matters18. This Guidance must be read against the background of the limitations imposed on the United Kingdom&apos;s freedom of action by international relations and international agreements. The Authority should maintain a close workingrelationship with the Department of Trade in all matters concerning relationswith countries and territories outside the United Kingdom, the UnitedKingdom&apos;s membership of international organisations and the implementation of the United Kingdom^ international obligations. In particular it should
provide such information, advice and assistance as may be needed for inter-national discussions. The Authority should make its expert assistance availableto foreign governments and others where this would promote British interestsincluding the export of British aviation products.Air Travel Organisers19. The Authority should, in the interests of the travelling public, use thepowers conferred by the regulations made under Section 26 of the Act tosatisfy itself as to the fitness and resources of applicants for Air Travel Organisers&apos;licences. It should not use these powers to restrict competition among travelorganisers. Us concern with standards of service should be confined to theoperation of air services, whether or not these form part of a holiday arrange-ment.Safety20. The Authority should aim to secure a high standard of aviation safety.It should seek to ensure that this high standard is achieved in the construction,maintenance and operation of aircraft and in the use of aerodromes. In so doing it should give effect to safety requirements deriving from international agreements, in particular the Chicago Convention (Cmd 8742) and the Annexesthereto. It should also ensure, where necessary, that timely preventive andremedial measures are taken and should promote the development of newequipment and techniques.Environment21. In exercising its functions the Authority should take full account of theneed to minimise disturbance caused to the public from noise, vibration andpollution arising from aircraft operations and should advise the Governmenton operational and economic aspects of achieving this objective. It should consist-operate in Government policies designed to protect the environment,encourage airline and airport operators to adopt such policies, and generallyassist the Government in implementing those policies.Information22. Subject to Sections 36 and 61 of the Act the Authority should publishpromptly and at suitably frequent intervals statistical and other information about the industry and enterprises within it including information relating tosafety matters. It should make the records of its public hearings readily available for inspection.Research23. The Authority should support an adequate programme of research anddevelopment on matters within its responsibility, in particular air safety andairworthiness, air traffic control and navigation services and air transporteconomics, co-ordinating its activities with Government departments and other bodies engaged in these fields.Consultation24. The Authority should maintain and develop appropriate consultativearrangements over the whole range of its functions.
Financial25. The Authority should perform its functions efficiently and economically.Its financial objective should be to recover, as soon as possible, the whole ofits costs, and a return on capital reasonable in relation to the nature of its activities and prevailing commercial standards, from those, including Govern-ment departments, who use or benefit from its services. Until the Authoritybreaks even the Government will pay it a grant-in-aid sufficient to meet itsexpected deficit on revenue account. This grant will be assessed annually inadvance. The Authority should continue to plan to dispense with grant-in-aidbeyond 1977-78 although the Government recognise that it may not be withinthe Authority&apos;s power to avoid a net deficit on revenue account attributable tothe provision of those en route navigation services for which charges need tobe agreed internationally. The Authority should continue to advise and assistthe Government in securing the earliest possible acceptance of arrangements that will permit the Authority to achieve its financial objective in this area of activity.
