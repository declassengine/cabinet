C(76) 1210 February 1976CABINETICELANDIC FISHERIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affaire1. I undertook on 5 February to circulate to the Cabinet for theinformation of members the details of the offers we had made to the icelandic Government during their recent talks with the Prime Minister,the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and myself.    details are as follows:Iceland to determine the Total Allowable Catch (TAC) of ccd.United Kingdom to receive 28 per cent of the TAC subject to aminimum of 65,000 tonnes and maximum of 75,000 tonnes.United Kingdom to receive a total of 85, 000 tonnes of all species,2,        An overall agreement could include some form of recognition ingeneral terms of Iceland&apos;s 200-mile limit.    The exact variant was not determined.3. On duration, we proposed the agreement should start from the dateof signature and in no case terminate before the German agreement(28 Norember 1977).   The problem of including fish already caught since thelast agreement lapsed was unxeeolved but would be included in any package.4.        If no agreement could be made, the United Kingdom would impose a voluntary limitation on catch levels in accordance with the needs ofconservation,5.        I floated the idea of some form of economic co-operation withinwhich the United Kingdom might assist the carrying out of projects ofimportance to Iceland, eg by a tied loan for economic development on softterms, while Iceland was subject to balance of payments difficulties.copy NO        R 1
6,        Our offer that we should receive 28 per cent of the TAC was madein the context of the discussion on conservation during which the Icelanderssuggested that they might not insist on a figure as low as the 230,000 tonnesadvocated by their scientists.    At one point they used an indicative figure of265,000 tonnes.    British BcientlstB believe that an appropriate figure is300, 000 tonnes.L J foreign and Commonwealth Office10 February 19762
