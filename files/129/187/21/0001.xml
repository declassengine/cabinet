THE RESUMED SEYCHELLES CONSTITUTIONAL CONFERENCE,1976REPORTL  introduction. As a result of the agreements reached at the first session of theSeychelles Constitutional Conference held in London in March 1975 (thereport of which was published as Cmnd. 6042) the following changesoccurred;(a) On 14 May, 1975, the 1970 Constitution was amended by Order inCouncil:(i) to permit the enlargement of the Legislative Assembly, consistingof the 15 members elected at the April 1974 elections, the attorney-General ex-officio and the Speaker, by the addition of10 nominated members appointed on the advice of the leaders ofthe two Seychelles political parties represented in the Assembly;and(ii) to provide for the enlargement of the Council of Ministers to amaximum of 12.(6) On 1 June appointments to the Legislative Assembly were madebringing the total of members from the Seychelles Democratic Party(SDP) to 18, and from the Seychelles Peopled United Party (SPUP)to 7. A Coalition Government was formed, with Mr. J. R. Mancham,the Leader of the Seychelles Democratic Party, as Chief Minister andMr. F. A. Rene\ the Leader of the Seychelles People&apos;s United Party,as Minister for Works and Land Development. Seven other ministers from the SDP and three other Ministers from the SPUP were appointed.(c) By Order in Council (The Seychelles (Constitution) Order 1975) madeon 17 September, 1975, the present Interim Constitution was enactedconferring internal self-government. This Constitution, which enteredinto force on 1 October. 1975, was based on those changes to the1970 Constitution agreed at the first session of the constitutional conference, and made provision with respect to fundamental rightsand freedoms of the individual, the office of Governor, the Legislature,the Cabinet, the Judiciary, the Public Service and Finance. It pro-vided for the Governor to have responsibility for certain matters relating to external affairs and defence; the Police Force; and broad-casting and newspapers. It also provided for a Security council with consultative functions with respect to those matters. this constitution also provided for a change of nomenclature: theLegislative Assembly was henceforth to be called the House of assembly; the Council of Ministers was redesignated as the Cabinet;and the Chief Minister became the Prime Minister.2. The 1975 Conference also recommended the appointment of anElectoral Review Commission as a possible means of resolving the differingviews which had then arisen regarding the system of elections and the size and composition of the Legislature.   The Commission, the members of
which were Tun Tan Siew Sin, s s m, j p (Chairman), Mr. Harvey Lloyd DaCosta, cmg, and Sir Leslie Monson, kcmg, met in London in October and november 1975 and visited Seychelles from 17 October to 13 November,1975. The Commission presented its report to the Secretary of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs on 2 December, 1975.3. At the March 1975 Conference it was also agreed to resume inJanuary 1976 when it would be the aim of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentfinally to determine the outstanding provisions of an Independence Con-stitution for Seychelles so that, subject to the approval of Parliament,Seychelles would be enabled to proceed to Independence, as desired by both Seychelles political parties, not later than 30 June, 1976.II.  The Resumed Conference4. The Conference resumed at Marlborough House on 19 January, 1976.The list of delegates, officials, observers and advisers who took part is at annex A. Mr. Ted Rowlands, m p. Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs presided.5. The text of Mr. Rowlands^ speech at the opening session is at annex B. The text of Mr. Mancham&apos;s response is at Annex C.6. The Conference discussed the principles of an Independence Con-stitution taking into account those principles on which a measure ofagreement was reached at the March 1975 Conference and the subsequentlydeclared wish of the Coalition partners that the Independence constitution should provide that Seychelles should be a Republic on Independence.7. The Conference considered a series of position papers representingthe agreed views of the two Seychelles political parties and on the basis ofthese papers reached agreement on the principles of an IndependenceConstitution which were discussed under the following headings:(a) Status of Constitution;(b) Citizenship;(c) Fundamental Human Rights;id) The President;(e) The Cabinet;(f) Parliament;(g) The Judicature;(ft) The Public Service;(0 Finance;if) Pensions; and(ft) Miscellaneous.The principles agreed by the Conference are set out below.Status of the Constitution8. The Constitution is to provide that Seychelles shall be a sovereignRepublic with the Constitution as the supreme law.
Citizenship9. All persons born in Seychelles before Independence Day and allpersons naturalised or registered by the Governor of the former colony ofSeychelles are to be citizens of Seychelles provided that they are citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. In general any citizen of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies whose father or husband so qualifies also willbecome citizens of Seychelles on Independence. Persons born in Seychellesafter Independence Day will be citizens of Seychelles save in the rarecircumstances engendered by diplomatic immunity or a state of war. Womenmay also acquire citizenship by virtue of marriage to a Seychelles citizen.Citizens of Seychelles and other Commonwealth countries will have thestatus of Commonwealth citizens in Seychelles. The Seychelles parliament will have the power to make provision for the acquisition, deprivation andrenunciation of citizenship.Fundameatal Human Rights10. The Constitution is to include those provisions of the 1975 Con-stitution safeguarding the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual,including the right to life, personal liberty and the protection of the law;freedom of conscience, of expression, of assembly and association and of movement; and protection for the privacy of a person&apos;s home and otherproperty and from deprivation of property without compensation. corporal punishment is to be abolished. Derogation from certain of these fundamentalrights and freedoms will be permitted in time of war or emergency or whendemocratic institutions are threatened by subversion. A declaration by thePresident of a state of emergency, or a situation which may lead to a stateof emergency, will not remain in force for more than 21 days without theapproval of the National Assembly which may authorise its extension for periods of not more than six months at a time.11. As in the Seychelles Interim Constitution of 1975 provision is to bemade in the Constitution for the enforcement by the Courts of the funda-mental rights and freedoms. In particular, any person alleging that any ofthe protective provisions is being or is likely to be contravened in relationto himself will have the right to apply to the Supreme Court for redress.The President12. Provision is to be made for the office of an elected President, to beassumed on Independence by the Prime Minister appointed under theSeychelles Interim Constitution of 1975 and in office when the IndependenceConstitution enters into force. Thereafter elections for the office of Presidentwill be held simultaneously with elections to the National Assembly. Themethod to be adopted will be that of aggregating the votes obtained by thevarious candidates for election to the Assembly and allocating them to the candidates for election to the office of President in accordance with the previously declared support of candidates for election to the national assembly. To qualify for election to the office of President a person mustbe a citizen of Seychelles and eligible for election to the Assembly.13. Full executive power is to be vested in the President who will beresponsible for foreign affairs, defence and internal security including the armed forces, the police, the prisons and immigration.

He will be empowered to appoint a Minister to dis-charge his executive functions during his absences; but that Minister will notbe empowered to dismiss the Prime Minister or any other Minister. the prerogative of mercy is to lie with the President on the advice of an AdvisoryCommittee.14. Provision is to be made for the National Assembly to remove thePresident from office for violation of the Constitution or gross misconduct,under a procedure requiring progressively greater majorities in the assembly at each of three stages. Provision is also to be made for the Cabinet toremove the President on grounds of mental or physical incapacity. In theevent of a vacancy, the Assembly is to elect a President and a procedure willbe provided for the interim.The cabinet is. Provision is to be made for a Cabinet, consisting of a PrimeMinister and 10 other Ministers (or such number of Ministers, as the national assembly may prescribe by law) appointed by the President from amongthe members of the National Assembly. The Cabinet is to be responsiblefor giving advice to the President on policy, other than on those matters for which the President has sole executive responsibility, and on such othermatters which the President may refer to it. The President is to preside at cabinet meetings and in his absence or whenever he so directs the PrimeMinister will preside. There is to be a Secretary to the Cabinet responsible to the President for the public service, the Cabinet Office and, on the presidents instructions, for arranging Ihe Cabinefs business.16. The Prime Minister will be the principal Minister and the leader ofGovernment business in the National Assembly and will be responsible, underthe directions of the President, for such business of the Government as thePresident may assign to him. Id his absence or incapacity the Presidentmay appoint another Minister to discharge his functions. Ministers willbe responsible, under the direction of the President, for such business of theGovernment as the President may assign to them.17. Parliamentary Secretaries may be appointed by the President from among the members of the National Assembly to assist the President, thePrime Minister or any Minister in the discharge of their functions.Parttameot18. Legislative power is to be vested in the Parliament of Seychellesconsisting of the President and the National Assembly. As recommendedby the Electoral Review Commission the Assembly is to consist of 25 elected members, 8 representing constituencies and 17 elected by proportional repre-sentation by the party list system. The present Assembly is to run its fullterm until 6 June, 1979. The present constituency boundaries are to beretained but the President is to appoint an Electoral Boundaries Commissionnot less than two years and not more than three years after independence;
and thereafter every 7 years. The Commission is to make its reports tothe National Assembly for approval or otherwise. An Electoral SupervisoryCommission will be set up, as necessary, to ensure the fair conduct ofelections.19. Only Seychelles citizens over 21 years of age or over will be eligible for membership of the National Assembly and the voting age is to befixed at 20 years of age, alterable by Act of Parliament.20. The President is to have power to summon the National Assembly athis discretion subject to not more than 12 months expiring between meetings.The power to prorogue and dissolve the National Assembly is to rest withthe President. A general election must take place after the dissolution andthe new Assembly must meet within three months. Unless dissolved before-hand the Assembly must be dissolved five years after its first meeting.During war or a state of emergency the President may extend the life ofthe National Assembly for up to five years beyond the date of dissolutionotherwise provided or he may convene a National Assembly which hasbeen dissolved.21. Bills will be passed by the National Assembly and become lawon their receiving the assent of the President following a procedure similarto that under the 1975 Constitution. There is to be provision, in the eventof the President refusing assent, for Bills to be re-presented if there is asufficient majority in the Assembly in favour of such a course. In suchan event the President must either assent or dissolve the Assembly.Entrenched clauses of the Constitution (governing the executive functionsof the President, the respective functions of Cabinet and Parliament, the judiciary and the entrenching provision itself) can be amended if supportedby not less than four-fifths of the membership of the Assembly.

Other amendments are to be madeto provide for provisional taxation in advance of legislation; some measureof flexibility on the timing of the presentation of the Annual Estimates;and an annual financial report to the Assembly.Pensions25. Her Majesty*s Government will assume responsibility for the pay-ment, after Independence, of pensions and compensation to expatriateofficers, who are in Government service in Seychelles before Independence,who are not citizens of Seychelles or who, having become Seychelles citizenson Independence renounce that citizenship within six months of a CitizenshipAct of Seychelles being enacted.MbcdDaneons26. The Conference agreed, in principle, to recommend to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and to Parliament the transfer of the Islands of Aldabra,Farquhar and Desroches to Seychelles sovereignty upon Independence. Thiswould be subject to certain conditions which, although also agreed inprinciple, required further clarification at a meeting of the three interested parties, i.e. the United Kingdom, Seychelles, and the United States to be held as soon as possible but at all events in time for the issue to be finally resolvedupon Independence.27. The Chairman explained the legislative steps that would need to betaken to introduce the Independence Constitution in accordance with thedecisions taken at the Conference.

Annex 6OPENING SPEECH BY MR. TED ROWLANDS, m p,PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATE FOR foreign and COMMONWEALTH AFFAIRSYour Excellency, Mr. Prime Minister, Honourable Ministers, Membersof the House of Assembly, Ladies and Gentlemen.As the new Chairman of the Seychelles Constitutional Conference, itgives me particular pleasure to extend to you a very warm welcome onbehalf of the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and her Majesty&apos;s Government. I look forward to taking up the matters wherethey were left off last March. I am confident that we will have both a successful and fruitful session.We are stiff very much on target for the achievement of SeychellesIndependence by the end of June of this year. This Conference is the mostimportant stage now before reaching that goal. This week we hope finallyto settle the terms of the Constitution under which Seychelles will conductits affairs as a fully independent State.Much progress was made last March. And I am sure you. Sir, and all members who were here at the last Conference, would wish me to paytribute to my predecessor (I am sorry I do not look so charming as my predecessor) Joan Lestor, who has since taken up new duties in the Depart-ment of Education and Science. Her contribution to the agreements reachedlast time, and to the clarification of matters then left outstanding, was verygreat. I am sure too, that you would wish me to pay tribute to one of thegreat warriors in our Foreign and Commonwealth Service, Sir DuncanWatson, who presided over some of the plenary sessions last time. since our Conference last March he has retired. His vast experience of con-stitutional matters was of invaluable assistance to us. I believe you would all join with me in wishing him a long and happy retirement.There is no need, I think, on this occasion to rehearse all the manymatters on which agreement was reached last time. These were recorded in the Report of the Conference and those relevant were incorporated inthe Interim Constitution, introduced on 1 October last.It would be wrong, however, not to refer today to the agreement of thetwo Seychelles political parties last March to join together in a coalition government. You will recall that this decision was greatly welcomed byMiss Lestor on behalf of Her Majesty*s Government. We believed that thetwo parties would each gain much from the experience of working together,thus easing the transition to full independence.This has indeed been so. It is a pleasure on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to pay tribute to the high qualities of leadership displayed by your Ministers in the Coalition Government. Your statesman-like andco-operative partnership has been of great benefit to the interests of Seychellesas a whole. I am sure that had it not been for this agreement and partnershipthis Conference would have been more difficult than I think it is going to be.
We are very glad to learn that both parties now feel that the Coalition shouldcontinue up to, and beyond, independence, thus providing a stable future for Seychelles. We have also taken due note of the desire of both partiesto hold elections to the National Assembly in 1979.I turn now to the matters which were not agreed last time and whichwill be the main topics for discussion this week.The first of these related to what the Report of the last session of this conference referred to as the central features ot an independenceconstitution: the Provisions relating to the electoral system; the size and composition of the National Assembly; and the amendment of entrenchedclauses of the Constitution. 1 am happy to learn that the Seychelles political parties have now been able to reach agreement among themselves on thesematters.From these agreed position papers which 1 have seen, I observe that full account has also been taken of the recommendations of the Electoral ReviewCommission. This was set up, with the agreement of all parties at the lastConference. The Commission met during the months of October and november and presented their report to the Secretary of State on 2 December.I think we have all had the opportunity to consider its recommendations andI believe I would be expressing the general view if I paid a warm tribute to the Chairman of the Commission, and his two colleagues. They broughtgreat political, legal and constitutional experience and mature judgment tobear on their task. We are all very grateful to them, and I am sure youare too.Naturally, the Seychelles agreed position papers have needed to adaptthe recommendations of the Commission to the situation created by thedecision that Seychelles should become a Republic on independence. Iunderstand that Seychelles Ministers of both parties have fully explained the reasons for this decision to Members of the House of Assembly.Let me say at once that Her Majesty&apos;s Government fully respect thisdecision. We have a number of minor questions from this side of the tableon the proposals in the agreed papers. These are merely designed toelucidate matters for the benefit of the legal draftsmen whose job it will beto translate the wishes of the Conference into a language appropriate to anIndependence Constitution. You will, of course, appreciate mat the decisionto opt for a Republic will mean considerably more work for the draftsmen.They will be unable to rely as much on the wording of the Interim Con-stitution as would otherwise have been the case.Apart from these central features of the Constitution, there are a numberof very important matters requiring further consideration this week.Principal among these are the outstanding questions relating to funda-mental human rights. I am very pleased to note from the Seychelles positionpapers that there is now agreement between the two parties on the matters,e.g. capital and corporal punishment, which proved contentious issues at our last meeting. This indeed should greatly ease our task at this Conference.
Necessarily we shall also have to consider a number of other essentialmatters (for instance, treaty succession) which inevitably form part of anindependence settlement but which had to be put aside because of shortageof time last March.There are, besides, a number of matters agreed last time which will nowneed to be reconsidered in the light of the decision to become a Republic.Most of these fortunately involve minor textual amendments to the provisions for an Independence Constitution agreed to at the last Conference. Againwe shall have a number of questions to put on behalf of the legal draftsmen.I can assure you they are not matters of principle or substance.If we are to keep to the legislative timetable and achieve independence bythe target date, this Conference will need to do its work well and do it speedily.I have few doubts that we will succeed; and I believe that there is in factgood will and determination in both parties to do so. It will put a greatdeal of stress on legal draftsmen to put the Independence Constitution in its final, definitive, form. We are ready to do our part and I am sure that theSeychelles Government will do theirs.Finally may I take this opportunity to underline the point that the friendship between the United Kingdom and Seychelles which has existed for 160 years will in no way be diminished after independence. Indeed,with the growth of modern communications and the progress of tourism inSeychelles, which receives so much favourable comment in Britain, there willbe even greater opportunities than ever before for our people to know moreabout each other. Britain will continue to take a close interest in the welfare of Seychelles and its people. We look forward to continuingco-operation with the Seychelles Government on a large range of issues onwhich we share a common point of view.As fellow members of the Commonwealth too, we shall have a Jointinterest in the furtherance of co-operation between countries in the interestsof peace and without regard to considerations of race or religion. We willboth continue to believe in the promotion of the prosperity of our peoplesthrough trade and through technical co-operation encouraging the develop-meat both of the individual and our countries as a whole.Sir, it is my privilege to be. as Minister in the Foreign and commonwealth office, the Minister for all remaining dependent territories. We used to navea Minister for the Colonies; now he is Minister for De-colonisation.Wherever possible it has been the policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government topromote independence for any dependent territory which wishes to become independent.You may be interested to know that when Seychelles becomes inde-pendent, as we hope it will in June, you will be the 38th territory or colonywhich has gone independent under Great Britain. This is a quarter of the membership of the United Nations, covering something like 900 million people. So you can see that we have had quite a bit of experience withconstitutional conferences. Some of them in the past have been rather more acrimonious than I hope this one will be this week.
It is in this sure knowledge of our experience of past friendship, thatI hope for our future relationship: that the growing friendship betweenSeychelles and the United Kingdom will now further be fostered andflourish after Seychelles becomes independent. It is in this context that Ihave great pleasure in declaring this resumed session of the SeychellesConstitutional Conference open.AnnexCRESPONSE BY THE HON. j. R. MANCHAM, fksa,PRIME MINISTER OF SEYCHELLESMr. Chairman, fetlow delegates:I would like to take this opportunity, Mr. Chairman, to thank yon forthe very kind words which you have expressed this morning on the openingof this Constitutional Conference. We, representing the Government andthe people of Seychelles, welcome the words you have expressed to theeffect that our development towards independence and our desire to adopta Republican status will in no way diminish the bonds of friendship andthe ties of understanding which have been built and will continue to be built between the great people of Great Britain and the people of our smallislands. We are thankful to your Government for the sense of enlighten-ment with which they have approached our development and our problems,and we live in hope this morning that this Conference will form the basisof a strong Government in Seychelles, a Government which will alwaysremember and perpetuate the ties of friendship which have characterisedour past relationship. Thank you.10931-21  Dd 213483   k3*  2/T6
