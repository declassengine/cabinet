CONSPIRACY AND CRIMINAL LAW REFORM bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. The Home Affairs Committee considered on 27 February the report and draft Bill prepared by the Law Commission on the law of conspiracy inEngland and Wales.    The Law Commission submitted their report at theend of January and it is to be published on 11 March.    The 24 clause bill attached to the report is divided into three main parts.    Part I dealB withconspiracy generally; it restricts the ambit of the offence of conspiracyand limits the penalties for such offences including conspiracies to commitoffences under the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875.    Part IImodernises and reinforces the criminal law about entering and remaining onproperty and has some relevance to aqua2*Jng0    Part III abolishes common law offences relating to public morals and decency and makesconsequential provisions for films, certain live performances and sexualbehaviour in public.   A copy of the Bill and a fuller account of the proposals and the considerations they raise are attached.2. The Queen&apos;s Speech said that the Government would give early consideration to the Law Commissions report, when received, with a viewto preparing legislation for the comprehensive reform of this branch of thelaw.    The question for urgent decision is whether to introduce a Bill this session, which means before Easter and, if so, whether to introduce thewhole of the Law Commission^ Bill or just Part I, suitably adjusted to stand on its own.    The timing is such that any Bill introduced this Sessionwill have to be presented as the unamended work of the Law Commission.The Home Affairs Committee recommends that the whole Bill ought to beintroduced this Session,3,        The principal argument in favour of limiting the Bill to Part I(6 clauses) is that it might make less demand on Parliamentary time.Squatting (and other aspects of trespass) and obscenity would createconsiderable Parliamentary interest and there would be no hope of a shortCommittee stage.    The main political objectives would be achieved by Part I.It is in this part that the Trades Union Congress and our backbenchersare most interested, and its provisions should be substantially welcomed.1O t0 xC(76) 23 COPY NO1 March 1976CABINET
4. Or. the other hand, limiting the Bil3 to Part I would not preventdiscussion on squatting and obscenity in Committee.   There would haveto be a provision saving the present position until the areas of the lawdealt with in the omitted Parts can be reformed and this would allow anynumber of amendments in Committee,, including, probably, amendments to insert the whole of Parts II and m if Members so chose.    It is likely to prove awkward to decide how best to separate Part I from the rest of theBill, and it may not bo easy to explain why Parts H and lit, though they exist in published form, have been omitted.    It would conflict with our commitment to proceed comprehensively; and it would certainly then bedifficult to avoid a commitment to an early Bill covering squatting andobscenity.    There are strongly held views on both subjects which cutacross Party lines.    It would be a pity to miss the opportunity to introducean independently produced Bill which strikes a fair balance on both subjectsbut which can be adjusted in Committee if it meets strong criticism in anyparticular respect.    If It appeared that discussion on Part HI was likelyto be unacceptably lengthy, we could consider what appears to be thepracticable course of separating Part III at Committee Stage and possiblyarranging for the Law Commission^ obscenity recommendations to be separately considered by a select committee.5.        I invite my colleagues to endorse the conclusion of fee Home AffairsCommittee that we should introduce the whole of the Law Commission^BiU this Session.    Subject to any views of Legislation Committee I proposethat the Bill be introduced on Monday 15 March,R H j home office March 19762
PART under existing law in England and Wales the offence of conspiracy comprises, inaddition to an agreement to commit a criminal offence, an agreement to effect certain-other &quot;unlawful&quot; objects.   And the penalty, whether imprisonment or fine, is &quot;at large&quot;, ie unlimited by statute.   Part I of the Bill remedies these features ofexisting law by:(a) creating a statutory offence of conspiracy which would be committed only when there was an agreement to commit a criminal offence;(b) fixing the maximum penalty for conspiracy to commit an indictable offenceat the maximum term for the offence itself or one year if the maximum is lessthan that;(c) fixing the maximum penalty for conspiracy to commit summary offences atone year.Part I also:(d) fixes the maximum penalty for conspiracy to commit an offence undersection 5 or ? of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875 at threemonthsj   and(e) gives the Director of Public Prosecutions control of prosecutions forconspiracy to commit a summary offence.The offence of conspiracy at common law is abolished save that conspiracy to defraudat common low will remain pending examination of the law of fraud.   The Billpreserves the safeguards for trade disputes in section J of the Conspiracyand Protection of Property Act 18?5*2. For the most part Part I should command widespread support. There will probablybe efforts in Parliament to do away with conspiracy altogether or to limits its use-1-CONFlDSNTIALANNSX
MS.more severely;    conversely there may be efforts to retain a wider scope for conspiracythan the Bill allows.   Conspiracy to commit summary offences is likely to be particularly controversial.   But the Commission seem to have struck roughly the rightbalance.3.     The change in the 1875 Act is presented in the report as giving effect to thepolicy of Parliament in 1875 a-6 a legal matter.   The Commission disclaims any view on the issue whether and, if so, how far it is right for the law of conspiracy to discriminate in favour of conduct in the course of a trade dispute.   Some will argue that the law should take no account of the peculiar susceptibility to conspiracycharges of those involved in a trade dispute.   The TUC will argue, with some support in the House, that the law of conspiracy ought to be kept out of trade disputescompletely.   What the Commission propose seems defensible in policy as well as onlegal grounds.part this Part creates the following offences:(a) entering by violence property on which another is present (but not in thecase of a person seeking to recover his own residential accommodation)j(b) failing to leave premises when required to do so by or on behalf of adisplaced residential occupier;(c) having an offensive weapon on property which one has entered as atrespasser;(d) entering or remaining upon the premises of a foreign mission as a trespasser;and(e) resisting or obstructing an officer of the court seeking to execute a writof possession.5. Opinion on this Part could break down on party lines. Some of our own supportersmay argue that the criminal law should not apply to any type of squatting but most
of our supporters are likely to agree that the criminal law ought to catch a person who squats in premises in which another person is living oad ought not to go anyfurther.   Opposition backbenchers, if not the front bench, are likely to press fora wider offence of squatting and may argue that it should never be an offence to seek to recover one*s own property by violence, whether or not the property isresidential.   The provisions will have little if any effect on the problem ofsquatting in housing provided by local authorities:   but in any case local authoritiesappear not to see a solution of these problems as lying in an extension of the criminal law.6.     The offence of failing to leave premises when required to do so by or on behalfof a displaced residential occupier is considerably narrower than the equivalentoffence on which opinion was canvassed in the Law Commission&apos;s consultative workingPaper.   It will not affect industrial disputes or political demonstrations.   Thenew offence of entering property could only catch strikers if they used violence;Peaceful industrial action will be untouched by any of the new offences.part hi7*     This Part:(a)    abolishes common law offences relating to public morals and decency;(b) brings films within the scope of the Obscene Publications Acts, subjectto:(i)   a separate, and narrower, defence of public good, based on theform used in the Theatres Act 1968;(ii)    the Director of Public Prosectuions being given control over theinstitution of prosecutions in respect of films shown in cinemas and filmsocieties but not in cinema clubs.(c)    creates a new offence of presenting an obscene live performance, tocover activities not at present covered by the Theatres Act;   and(d)    creates a new offence of engaging in overt sexual behaviour.
8.     This Part can be expected to generate some heat, not least by opening upgenerally the controversial subject of obscenity and enabling amendments to be movedeither to strengthen the Obscene Publications Acts or further to diminish their scope.The particular proposal to apply a variant of what is increasingly seen by the anti-obscenity lobby and by prosecutors as an unsatisfactory statute to films will be muchcriticised as a weakening of the control on filas, though it will be welcomed inthe film industry and among those responsible for censorship.9.     In making their recommendation that the prosecution of films should be controlled by the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Law Commission took the advice of the Attorney General.
