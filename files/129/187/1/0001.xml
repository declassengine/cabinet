THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(76) 1 COPY NO     SL12 January 1976CABINETREVIEW OF PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDUREMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. We undertook in The Queen&apos;s Speech to put forward proposals &quot;for a major review of the practice and procedure of Parliament&quot;.2.        The aim of the review will be to consider the adequacy with which parliament performs its functions in the last quarter of the 20th century.The Committee should in my view be free, and indeed encouraged to approach its remit in a radical way, beingfng forward for study proposalswhich would involve a complete break with past traditions and practices.We must accept that such a review would inevitably raise the fundamentalIssue of the relationship between Parliament and the executive and weshould expect proposals aimed at enhancing the role of backbench Membersof Parliament in the pre-legislative stage of policy development, and atincreasing their ability to scrutinise and monitor the Governments executiveactions.3. A Procedure Committee of the conventional kind would not in my view be likely to produce the kind of radical thinking required.    I have it in mind to suggest to the House that it would be right in this case for the House toappoint a high-powered committee of inquiry broadly with the powers of a select Committee, chaired by a prominent backbanch Member with amajority of Parliamentarians but containing a significant minority ofmembers from outside Parliament.4.        If this general approach is agreed I propose arranging a debate onthe review as soon as possible.    In opening tho debate I would outline theGovernment^ view ae to the scope, nature and membership of the inquiry.I believe I should also make it clear that the review would not consider thepowers of the House of Lords or the constitutional relationships between thetwo Houses.    I understand that a similar committee may be set up in theHouse of Lords and I should suggest that it would be advantageous if somejoint meetings and joint consideration of problems could take place betweenthe two committees.    On some aspects of common concern It might even bedesirable for the two committees to produce a joint report.1
5. Finally I believe 1 should indicate that in our view the terms ofreference of the committee should be compatible with our system in which aGovernment is elected on specific policy commitments and that the ability ofa Government to legislate on these and other issues should be assured.After listening to the debate I would bring draft terms of reference and a proposed composition of the committee to my colleagues for their consideration,6.        While I recognise that a review of the kind 1 propose will be likely toproduce proposals which will increase the status and power of parliament in relation to the executive 1 believe this is necessary if the decline ofconfidence in the institution of Parliament (and the consequent increasingtendency of interest groups to resort to extra-Parliamentary methods in expressing their dsmands) is to be arrested.7. I invite my colleagues to endorse this general approach.E privy Council Office12 January 19762
