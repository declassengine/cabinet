C(76) 6 COPY NO2 February 1976CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE WHITE paper memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. I attach z draft White Paper embodying the decisions on public expenditure which we took at our meeting on 11 December(CC(75) 55th Conclusions, Minute 2)0THE STRATEGY FOR PUBLIC EXPENDITURE2.        This year the public expenditure White Paper is likely to attractan exceptional amount of attention, both from our supporters and ourcritics.    The Chief Secretary and I are therefore taking a close interestin its presentation.    The opening pages of the White Paper set out themain themes in our strategy - that w*s are not cutting expenditure whileunemployment is high, but are in fact spending more on some programmes which help employment and industry; but this level of expenditure hasentailed a high budget deficit in spite of high taxation all round;  and, iftaxation is not to go much higher still, we must keep within the white paper limits for the coming year and then have a period of stability in total public expenditure.    This will free resources for exports,investment and take-home pay as the economy expands.3.        The Secretary of State for Employment, the Secretary of State for industry and the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protectionhave joined me in taking the Trades Union Congress (TUC) into our confidence about this policy, and I believe that they have a goodunderstanding of the problem.   Inevitably thare will be demands for additional expenditure going beyond the salective measures which wehave in mind, but equally we will be exposed to attack for the continueddeficit implied by the White Paper plans.4.        It will be particularly damaging if people believe that expenditure is not merely high but out of control.    In the context of the White paper and elsewhere we will be explaining some of our measures to bring aboutbetter control; these will include the extension of cash limits and- 1
improved monitoring of expenditure in the short term, and we will seekimprovements in our medium-term planning of expenditure.    We must ensure that individual expenditure decisions through the year are betterrelated to our strategy for public expenditure as a whole, both in the short and the medium term.    This will require a more systematic approach tothe handling of claims on the contingency reserve.DETAIL IN THE WHITE paper .        At the Cabinet meeting on 11 December it was suggested that muchof the difficulty experienced in the conduct of the present exercisestemmed, not simply from the need to take decisions so far in advance(which would continue to be necessary) but from the existing requirement to publish a great deal of detail in the annual White Paper,,    I was askedto consider whether in fact it was necessary to do so.    There is an obviousproblem here.    Public expenditure currently takee 60 per cent of ourGDP, and even after the review we have just completed will take well over50 per cent.    There is no meaningful way of planning expenditure of this magnitude without going into substantial detail.6.        I have asked my officials to take a fresh look, in consultation withthe other Departments concerned, at the way in which the programmes are to bo presented to Cabinet for decision following the 1976 public expenditure survey.    But whatever presentation is adopted for our cabinet discussions, a great deal of supporting material will have to be availableto Departments in one w&amp;y or another to enable the main expenditureproposals to be formulated and, if approved, to be translated into detailedprogrammes.7.        The White Paper itself starts with a clear explanation of our broadapproach, but this too has to be supplemented by a great deal of furtherinformation.   As soon as we announce our main decisions we have to beready to deal with a flood of questions about their detailed implications,Much of the additional analysis in the While Paper stems from specific recommendations by the Select Committee on Expenditure,    They wouldbe likely to resist any substantial omissions, and, if we gave much lessinformation, we should risk incurring criticism that we were seeking to conceal information from parliament,8,        I have nevertheless asked my officials to take another look at thisquestion before the next White Paper.    Meanwhile, we have made some small reductions in the size of the White Paper by omitting the charts anddiagrams in the programme chapters in Part 2; omitting from theadditional statistics section (now Part 4) the tables showing charges etcwhich were Tables 3,10 to 3.12 in Cmnd 5879; and confining the analysisby main programme and spending authority etc to one table (Table 4.5)rather than three.    The Select Committee will be informed of these changes before the White Paper is published.
LOCAL AUTHORITIES9.        It has been agreed that local authorities should be given somedetails of the public expenditure figures which are of concern to thema day or two in advance of publication.    This would involve givingfigures in confidence to the Secretaries of the local authority associationsthree days before publication and arranging a meeting with theConsultatiya Council the day before publication.    Since the localauthorities account for a large part of total public expenditure, it isessential that they should understand and adhere to the plans set out inthe White Paper.PUBLICATION DATE10.       If the White Paper is approved by Cabinet on 5 February, it canbe published in the week beginning 16 February.    To allow time forinforming the local authorities on the lines just mentioned, and forliaison with the Select Committee on Expenditure, it is proposed that publication date should be Thursday 19 February.    Publicity will be givento the White Paper through a variety of means, including articles in theTreasury Economic Progress Report;  and the Chief Secretary and I willhold a special press conference.CONCLUSIONS11.        I ask my colleagues to approve the attached White Paper, subjectto any minor or drafting amendments which may be necessary, for publication on 19 February.D W treasury Chambers2 February 1976

PART public Expenditure General ReviewIntroduction:1. This White Paper sets out the Governmenfs plans for public expen-diture until the end of the decade. In managing public expenditure twoproblems stand out. The first has been with us for many years. Popularexpectations for improved public services and welfare programmes havenot been matched by .tfw growth in output or by willingness to forgoimprovements in private living standards in favour of those programmes.The oil crisis intensified this gap between expectations and available resources. The second problem is that of cost inflation. Which has becomeacute hi the last few years, and has added an extra dimension of difficulty.2. In the last three years public expenditure has grown by nearly 20per cent in voluihe. while output has risen by less than 2 per cent. the ratio of public expenditure to gross domestic product has risen from 50per cent to 60 per cent. The tax burden has also greatly increased over recent yekrs- In 1975-76 a married man on average earnings is payingabout a quarter of his earnings in income tax, compared with a tenth in1960-V1. At twc-4hn-ds average earnings, he is paying about a fifth corn-pared with less than a.twentieth.3. Tax thresholds have fallen sharply in relation to average earnings,and people are being drawn into tax at income levels which are belowsocial security benefit levels, The increase in the tax burden has fallenheavily on low wage earners. Those earning less than the average con-tribute over a quarter of the income tax yield. This cannot be made goodsimply by increasing the burden at the top: if no taxpayer were left with more than  5,000 per annum after tax, this would increase the yield by only about 6 per cent4 At a time of world recession rising pubHc expenditure withoutmatching tax increases has helped to sustain employment. The tax burdenin recent years would have been much larger if the Government had not accepted a high public sector deficit for this reason. But as recoveryproceeds we must progressively reduce our publie sector deficit Whenworld demand picks up, more resources-capital as well as manpower-willbe needed for exports and investment We must ensure that they are avail-able for that purpose. Unless we are prepared to see rising taxation reducetake home pay, these resources can be made available only if we keep public
expenditure at roughly the same level for several years. Changing the structural distribution of resources in this way is the only means of restoringand maintaining full employment.5. In spite of slow economic growth compared with other countries,great advances have been made in the lait thirty years in our public services.These are rightly regarded as an important complement to individualspending. But the satisfaction of demands for further improvements, how-ever desirable, depends on our industries generating the output and over-seas sales to make those improvements possible. North Sea oil will make animportant difference to our affairs, but it will not be big enough by itself,and it will not be fully developed soon enough, to solve the problem of resources over the next few years. For that we must improve the produc-tivity of other industries. .     ,6. The plans in this White Paper are therefore intended broadly to stabilise the level of resources taken by expenditure programmes after1976-77. If this is achieved public expenditure will fall as a proportionof national output from its present exceptionally high level. The tax burdenwill still increase, but. by a manageable amount. Meanwhile, within totalpublif expenditure, a higher priority is being given to expenditure whch is designed, to maintain or improve our industrial capability, and to give us abetter chance of success as the economy picks up.7. The solution of the second problem-that of cost inflation-liesmainly outside this White Paper. It must depend essentially on success inthe general fight against inflation, with continuing good, sense in pavsettlements at the heart of.this struggle for economic survival. But, inthe field of public expenditure, the attack: on inflation will be buttressedby the extension of cash control in 1976-77 over a wide range of public spending. This new approach, which has been welcomed by the expenditure committee in a recent report*, is further described in paragraphs 14-15below.8. Controlling the growth of expenditure is not solely a matter of limiting the cash outlay in a particular year. It also arises, as the Expenditure Corn&quot;mittee have pointed out in their latest report**, in making and holding Wmedium-term plans. Programmes are not immutable, and must foe DP*fto; revision in either direction as circumstances require. The problem *to find a way of allowing this flexibility to respond to new events, withon1at the same time allowing ever-growing expectations for better services topre-empt more and more resources and to require higher and higher taWlion. Technical methods,of expenditure control cannot do this, by.themselves;they only provide the framework within which essentially political decisions are taken and implemented. But the present arrangements for planningexpenditure, which have been continuously developed over the past decade,are capable of further adaptation to help in contending with this problem.* Ninth Report, Session 1974-75.** Fiat Report, Senkm 1975-76.
The present review9. The Government published in January 1975 the outcome of their firstreview of public expenditure plans (Cmnd. 5879). In doing so they made it clear that there were many uncertainties about the amount of resourcesthat might become available, and that they would reappraise the programmeswhenever necessary. The Chancellor of the Exchequer subsequentlyannounced in his Budget that, in order to reduce the expected borrowing requirement in 1976-77, reductions would be made in the planned level of anumber of programmes in that year. Since then, the Government have beencomprehensively reviewing their plans for subsequent years. The rest ofthis Part of the White Paper gives a brief account of the changes since cmnd 5879 in 1975-76 and 1976-77, and then describes the broad effect ofthe revisions to expenditure plans for the later years. Fuller information about the effect of the review on particular programmes is given in Part 2.10. Not all of this spending is in the hands of central government. Someis carried out by the nationalised industries, and a larger part (around 27 percent) by local authorities. Their co-operation in maintaining a tight control on their expenditure will be essential if this national strategy is to beachieved.1975*76 and 1976-7711. The programmes for the current financial year and fof 1976-77 arehigher than in Cmnd 5879 by about  1,600 million and  400 miflion*. in both years a significant part of the increase is due, in one way or another,to the recession.12. In-1975-76 the main increases are in the field of industry and employ-ment. They include extended measures of industrial support of various kinds,provision for the British National Oil Corporation (BNOQ, more industrial training, and exceptionally heavy demands for financing nationalised industrycoal and steel stocks at a time of recession. There have been higher payments of unemployment benefit and supplementary benefit. Payments to the food and agricultural industries have also been higher than forecast in Cmnd5879: most of this increase has been in import subsidies paid under thecommon agricultural policy and mainly offset by receipts from the european communities.13. The reductions imposed in the last Budget on planned expenditurein 1976-77, equivalent to about  1,100 million at 1975 Survey prices, affectedcapital and current expenditure on a wide range of services. These reduc-tions have been offset by the additional expenditure in that year announced in the White Paper &quot;The Attack on Inflation&quot; (Cmnd 6151); the cost ofthe employment measures announced in September; provision for BNOC,for the National Enterprise Board and for other industrial expenditure;and higher social security benefits (mainly on account of unemployment).Outside the ordinary public expenditure programmes, in both years thehigh borrowing requirements have greatly increased the burden of debt interest.* All figures are at 1975 Surrey pricet unless otherwise stated.
Cash Control14. Public expenditure programmes cannot proceed regardless of the movements in their cash costs. Following a greatly excessive rise in tenderprices and signs of overload on the building industry, cash limits were intro-duced on the main building programmes for the public services, other thanhouses and roads, in 1974-75 and 1975-76. In July 1975 the government announced that work was in hand to bring about the extensive use of cashlimits in 1976-77, on those expenditures where such limits can impose greaterfinancial discipline and precision than the present system.15. In 1976-77 cash control will be applied to about three-quarters ofcentra! Government voted expenditure (other than social security cash pay-ments). The main exceptions will be those services where, for statutory orother reasons, the rate of spending cannot be determined by the Govern-ment in the short term: this is why social security payments are beingexcluded, as well as, for example, expenditure on family practitionerservices, agricultural support and some forms of regional assistance. Cashlimits on the rate support grant to local authorities were announced in Novem-ber; and cash control will also apply to most local authority capital pro-grammes, but not to investment in new dwellings. Arrangements have alsobeen introduced for closer monitoring of the cash requirements of nationalised industries. Details of the expenditure to be covered, and of the cash limits for 1976-77, will be published around the beginning of the financial year.1977-78 to 1979-8016.  The programmes for 1977-78 onwards in Cmnd 5879 have been substantially revised. In this the Governments main aim has been: first, to stabilise the total level of spending on the expenditure programmes for the time being, so that enough resources are availablefor increased exports and investment; second, to give priority to expenditure for improving industrial productivity and efficiency, and hence to increase the rate of growth of resources.17. The programmes in Cmnd 5879 provided for some continuing growth of expenditure during this period. In order to stabilise the level of spending,the total size of those programmes in that White Paper has been scaled downas described in paragraphs 26-33 below. As soon as a sound economic basecan be achieved, some growth in -spending should again bepossible. But at least during the next 3 years or so, no overall growth in public expenditure (excluding debt interest) is planned beyond the level now envisaged for 1976-77. This means that in all programmes, including thesocial programmes, very strict tests of priority have had to be applied. TheGovernments purpose in making these hard decisions was to ensure thatthe increase in national output in the next three or four years is notappropriated for use in the public sector, but instead is available to put the balance of payments right, to provide for increased productive invest-ment, and to allow a modest rate of increase in private consumption.Holding public expenditure and public service manpower broadly steady
while output increases will permit that shift of resources which it is theirstrategic aim to bring about.18. On the second point, the Governments industrial policies are intendedto produce a faster long-term growth of output. These policies will be sup-ported by substantially higher expenditure in the trade, industry and employ-ment programme, which now includes provision for expenditure whichpreviously was a charge on the contingency reserve, including that of theNational Enterprise Board and the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies.Including these items, this programme is now planned to be nearly  500million higher in 1978-79 than the programme in Cmnd 5879. Much ofthis expenditure will assist industrial investment; it is essential for thesuccess of the Governments industrial policies that investment shouldsoon recover from the recession and then continue at a higher level. But ifinvestment, whether by private or public enterprise, is financed or supportedby public funds, the Government will expect that the operations concerned should be efficient and competitive. This is a main objective of the Govern-menfs industrial policies including the expansion of industrial training.Public expenditure and resources19. Table 1.1 on page 6 sets out public expenditure in terms of its demand on real resources, and relates it to the total resources likely to be available and the other claims on them. This relationship is also illustrated in thecharts on page 7. The form of presentation was explained in some detail in Cmnd 5879.20. Economic projections over as long a period as five years are boundto be very uncertain, both in the assessment of the growth of output and inthat of the prior claims placed on that output by investment and the balanceof trade. The reductions in public expenditure programmes in the later years will also favourably affect the estimate of output growth and influence theprospects for the prior claims; an approximate allowance for this isincorporated in the table. In order to reflect all these uncertainties, the table shows three alternative projections.21. The central case, in column II of the table, shows an average rateof growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) between 1974 and 1979 of just under 3J per cent per annum. This is also the case illustrated in thecharts. The other two cases, in columns I and III, illustrate respectively a lower and a higher average growth of output over the period. The higher ofthese alternatives illustrates the possibility that GDP may rise faster as aresult of the industrial measures already described. These measures should bring about a faster long-term growth of productive potential, thus eventuallyyielding more resources for both public and private consumption. They will,however, take time to have effect. The implications of a rather faster rateof GDP growth during the period to 1979-at just over 3$ per cent perannum--are set out in column HI of the table, but it would be imprudent,in planning the public use of resources, to count on such an improvementuntil there is clear evidence that it is being achieved.

The coverage of the public expenditure figures given in section Cl of this Table differs in some respects from that used generally in this White Paper, for the reasons explained in the notes in Part 5, Section iv IV-

It is Dot possible in this Chan to show the smalldec&amp;K over the period in other public investment
22. But there are also greater risks on the downward side. The seriousrate of inflation may have checked the growth of productive potential, andthis effect will be made worse if inflation is not decisively and permanentlyreduced. Unless this is successfully achieved, and the present balance of pay-mertts deficit steadily reduced, a return to acceptable and sustainable levels of employment will be impossible: the decision would be out of the Govern-menfs hands. The lower growth case in column I of the table just under2j per cent per annum should therefore be regarded as purely illustrativeand not necessarily as a lower limit.23. Because of our big balance of payments deficit, a large amount of resources has to be used for closing the external balance. A further large amount is required for investment in the private sector and the nationalised industries. The amount provided in the table for investment inthe private sector is based on past relationships between industrial investment and growth of GDP. If, because of the high priority which the Governmentis giving to industrial investment, this were to grow faster than indicated inthe table, there would in the short run be rather less room for growth inthe resources available for other purposes.24. On the assumptions used in the central case, the growth in theresources available for other public expenditure and private consumptioncomes to an annual average rate of about \\ per cent. In the other two casesthe corresponding rates are i per cent and 1J per cent. After allowing for the reduced public expenditure programmes now set out in this white paper, personal consumption (including that financed by public transfer pay-ments) is estimated to grow at an average rate of 1  per cent in the centralcase. &quot;Privately-financed consumption&quot; ie consumption paid for out of pay and profits and not from public transfer payments, is estimated to grow atan average rate of about 1$ per cent in the central case, and at J per cent and 2i per cent in the two other cases, In aJi three cases the growth of GDPexceeds that of &quot;privately-financed consumption&quot; by a substantial margin.This implies that in order to implement the public expenditure programmeswithout damage to exports and investment, some rise in the burden of taxa-tion is likely to be required.25. The ratio of the total of public expenditure to GDP at factor costhas grown from 50 per cent in 1971-72 to about 60 per cent in 1975-76.With the programmes as now revised, and with the central assumptionabout the future growth of GDP in Table 1.1, it would fall to about 53 percent in 1979-80. But this ratio compares two disparate magnitudes transfer payments are included in the total of public expenditure but do not constitutepart of GDP. The ratio of public expenditure on goods and services to GDProse from less than 31 per cent in 1971-72 to about 35 per cent in 1975-76,and would fall to about 28 per cent in 1979-80. The corresponding ratio for transfer payments rose from 19 per cent to 26 per cent, and would fall toabout 24 per cent. These transfer payments, while helping to finance personal consumption, do also add to the tax burden.
Public expenditure programmes26. Tables 1.2 and 1.3 show the overall growth over the period of theprogrammed expenditure on goods and services and on transfer payments,etc, broken down by main programme. The programme totals are also sum-marised in Table 1.4 on page 14.27. Within the overall constraints on resources, the growth of individual programmes depends partly on their relative priorities and partly on demo-graphic and other factors affecting the profile of public expenditure, includingthe rates of growth in previous years. A crude comparison of growth ratesover the Survey period is not therefore a useful criterion by which to judge the programmes, and the implications of the revised figures for the variouspublic services are set out in detail in Part 2.28. The changes made in the programmes published in Cmnd 5879 are set out in Table 4.6. For the reasons already explained, substantial additionshave been made to the trade, industry and employment programme. Thereare also additions to the social security programmes and to the &quot;other public services&quot; programme. Planned expenditure on overseas aid has been maintained.29. All the other main programmes have been reduced in the later years of the period. In 1978-79, the difference between these programmes and those in Cmnd 5879, together with the extra savings on civil service staff costs mentioned in paragraph 32 below amounts to a total saving of 3 billion.30. These reductions have been spread very widely across expenditurein the programmes concerned. Substantial contributions have been made fromplanned spending on the defence budget ( 190 million), education ( 620million), roads and transport ( 500 million), other environmental services( 220 million), and health and personal social services ( 150 million). Inthe housing programme no reduction is planned in the programme for building new houses; the planned level of subsidies is however lower thanin Cmnd 5879 by  320 million. The planned rundown of food subsidies hasbeen accelerated, producing a saving of  290 million.31. A number of other programmes are also lower than in Cmnd 5879 for example, law, order and protective services; overseas services otherthan overseas aid; government office building and other common services.The capital programmes of the nationalised industries are lower than those shown in Cmnd 5879, mainly due to a reduced forecast demand for electricity and some reductions in the investment plans for telecomrnunica-tions and railways. The Northern Ireland programme has been reduced,and some expenditure has been reallocated to meet local priorities; ingeneral the reductions in planned expenditure have been parallel to thosein Great Britain.32. In addition to the programme reductions already described in thelast two paragraphs, the Government have decided that reductions must be

They intend to save an additional  140million in 1978-79 by reductions in planned expenditure on staff and related administrative costs. The overall reduction, not yet attributed toprogrammes, has been included in the summary expenditure tables in this white Paper.33. The figures for the expenditure programmes in this White Paperindicate present plans for the development of the various services. Inmany cases they will necessarily be affected by developments in the economy as a whole, or in the circumstances in which particular services are provided and expenditure incurred. While the Government recognise the need forspending authorities to plan ahead on as firm a base as practicable, the uncertainties in the prospects for the economy and for world trade and payments rule out a firm commitment to expenditure plans. The Govern-ment will therefore be ready to modify and adapt these plans as the generalcourse of the economy and the most important needs of the communityrequire.Debt interest34. As in previous White Papers debt interest is shown separately fromthe figures of current and capital expenditure on spending programmes.It is a claim which has to be met before money or resources can heallocated to programmes.

A fuller explanation of the provision for debt interest is given in Chapter 17 of Part 2.35. The estimates of debt interest in this White Paper are considerably higher than those in Cmnd 5879, by amounts rising to over  3 billion by1978-79. Most of this increase is due to the recent large growth in the borrowing requirement and to the effect of the lower rate of inflationnow assumed. The forecast increase in debt interest places a relatively lowdemand on resources, and the reductions in spending programmes will thus have a far more marked effect on demand than the higher debt interest.Nationalised industry subsidies36. Very large sums have been paid as compensation for price restraint in the last two years to the electricity and gas industries and to the PostOffice. In 1974-75 the cost was about  630 million at outturn prices.Continuation of these unselective subsidies, involving a heavy financial burden and corresponding additions to the borrowing requirement, would bring an unwelcome stimulus to consumer demand for the industries&apos;products which, if not checked, would require substantial extra capital investment. As already announced, the subsidies will be phased out
completely in the course of the current year. The Governments subsidy to the rail passenger network will continue for social reasons but will beheld constant in real terms. Some subsidies will continue to be paid to thecoal industry, mainly for redundant mineworkers and pensioners, but, ingeneral, the industry is expected to operate commercially from now on. Infuture, the general aim will be for the nationalised industries to financemore of their capital expenditure from earnings, and to reduce their demands for borrowing and for grants.Local authorities37. It has become increasingly clear that the substantial rate of expansion of recent years in local authority manpower and in local spendingcould not continue. The Government have not shared the view that thenecessary constraint will be obtained only if the central control which is exercised over capital expenditure is extended to current expenditure also.Instead they have sought to promote improved understanding and greater co-operation between central and local government. They have also askedlocal authorities to undertake a radical examination of their present pro-grammes and future plans.38. The need to hold the rate of increase in current expenditure in1975-76 to about half that of the previous year was reflected in detailedguidance which demonstrated the Governments recognition of the effects on individual services of limiting increases to inescapable commitments.The guidance was given after the rate support grant settlements at the endof 1974; and present estimates confirm that in general local authoritieshave responded to national needs and to the Governments requests.39. The support of the local authority members of the consultative council on Local Government Finance, which was established in May 1975,has been of great value in developing recognition of the need for afundamentally changed attitude towards the level of expenditure. Thiswill be more than ever necessary in the immediate future, for no increasein the total of current expenditure can be afforded over the next fewyears. Any increases in individual services, Whether for demographic orother reasons, must be offset by reduced levels of provision in other services.40. The rate support grant settlements for 1976-77 which were announced in November 1975 were made on this basis; and the total amountof grant for the year ahead has been subjected to a pre-determined cashlimit. The quarterly statistics of local authority manpower in Englandand Wales which have been collected, and scrutinised jointly by central and local government, since April 1975, and parallel action which is pro-posed in Scotland, will enable a close watch to be maintained on theeffect on numbers employed in individual services of the overall stand-still in expenditure.
41. The plans outlined in this White Paper for the development of individual local authority services in the period beyond 1976-77 have notyet been discussed in the Consultative Council on Local government finance or with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities. In thelight of such consultations, the Government will consider giving furtherguidance to local authorities on the implications for their services and theirmanpower requirements. The Government hopes that these consultationswill lead to more effective collaboration in future in the overall planning of local expenditure in the medium-term. The fact that the government does not control the current expenditure of local authorities underlinesthe need for closer cooperation between central and local Government.It does not detract from the need to present a full picture of the intendeddevelopment of the important sector of the public services which theyadminister.The individual programmes42. Part 2 of this White Paper explains the revised programme figures which have come out of the present review and the main changes since cmnd 5879. It also contains separate chapters on the provision for the contingency reserve and shortfall, and for debt interest. Part 3 containsspecial analyses of the expenditure which falls within the responsibility ofthe Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales, and of local authority expenditure. Part 4 contains further statistical analyses including a summaryof the comparison between the figures in this White Paper and those in cmnd 5879.

PART public Expenditure The Individual ProgrammesINTRODUCTION1. The usual format of separate chapters on each of the main pro-grammes has been continued this year. Each chapter starts with a tableanalysing the figures by programme and sub-programme and including a comparison between the figures in this White Paper and those in the lastWhite Paper (Cmnd 5879).2. The changes shown in the comparison are described in the test which follows each table and a summary analysis is provided in Table 4.6. It willbe seen in Table 4.6 that a distinction is drawn between changes that have been announced before publication of this White Paper and other changes. The latter category includes decisions incorporated in this white paper which have not been previously announced.3. The figures in Cmnd 5879 were at 1974 Survey Prices. For the purposeof comparison in this White Paper the figures in Cmnd 5879 have beenrevalued to 1975 Survey prices (see the glossary in Part 5 for a definition of revaluation).

The Governmentsdefence policy objectives will be fully described in the 1976 Statement onthe Defence Estimates, to be published shortly.CHANGES IN PROGRAMMED EXPENDITURE2.  The main changes in the Defence Budget since Cmnd 5879 are:(a) the Defence Review savings, described as provisional pending con-sultation with NATO, were confirmed;(b) a further saving of  136 million was made on the planned defence budget for 1976-77, as part of a reduction in public expenditure for that year announced in the April 1975 Budget Statement;(c) in the years 1977-78 to 1979-80 additional savings of  177 million, 193 million and  164 million are to be made.

With these additional savings, the total reductions in the defence budget as planned before the Defence Review will now be  470 million in1976-77,  615 million in 1977-78,  810 million in 1978-79, and  930 million in 1979-80.4. The savings in paragraph 2(c) above will be made by reductions insupport, not front-line. They will not impinge on the essential elements ofour contribution to NATO. They reflect the new defence agreement withHong Kong, whereby the Hong Kong Government make an increasedcontribution to the garrison costs from 1976-77. The figures allow for sub-stantial reductions in civilian manpower in addition to those resulting fromthe Defence Review.5. The changes in the National Accounts Adjustments are largely dueto changes in the estimated capital requirements of the Royal OrdnanceFactories.

The adjustment(line (b)) represents the difference between the two figures.Overseas aid. The Aid Programme has been maintained from 1977-78 onwards atthe levels planned in Cmnd 5879. The figures for overseas aid in Table 2.2are net of amortisation of previous loans. This is the basis on which overseas aid counts towards the internationally accepted aid targets that at least 1 percent of the gross national product (GNP) be devoted to total financial flowsto the developing countries, and that at least 0-7 per cent of GNP be devotedto official development assistance. HMG has accepted both targets inprinciple while making it clear that we cannot set a date by which we shallreach the 0-7 per cent target: our progress towards it must be determinedby the pace of our own economic recovery and by the other calls on our resources. In 1974 financial flows reached 1-20 per cent of GNP, and officialdevelopment assistance reached 0-38 per cent.2. 1975 saw the end of the commodity boom of 1973 and 1974, and aserious deterioration in most developing countries&apos; terms of trade. For thefuture, the better off developing countries will benefit more than the poorest countries from the end of the recession, and international attention must therefore be focussed on the prospects for the poorest countries. HMG&apos;s aidstrategy, detailed in &quot;The Changing Emphasis in British Aid Policies&quot;(Cmnd 6270), of giving more help to the poorest is particularly appropriate in these circumstances and these countries will receive an increasing propor-tion of aid programme allocations.

The allocations are reviewed regularly. In 1976-77 it is planned thatroughly half the allocations will go to bilateral capital aid, a quarter throughmultilateral institutions, and a little less than a fifth in technical assistance.The remainder will be spent through the Commonwealth development corporation and on payment of pensions to British citizens who have workedfor the Governments of developing countries. Within this framework thereis a traditional pattern of allocations to Commonwealth countries (over 70per cent of bilateral aid) and a significant, but decreasing, allocation forour remaining dependencies (some 9 per cent of bilateral aid). In 1974 over63 per cent of bilateral aid went to the poorest countries those with a 1972GNP of less than US $200 a head and it is planned that this will increasein the future.4. Over two-thirds of bilateral aid in 1974 was in the form of loans(mainly interest-free), and nearly one third in the form of grants. The UnitedKingdom complied in 1974 with the main objective contained in the Recom-mendation on Terms of the Development Assistance Committee (DAQ ofthe Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. On thebasis of the Grant Element, which is the internationally recognised measureof concessionary&apos;, the UK attained an average grant element of just over-See Part 5, Section 1,
86 per cent against a target of at least 84 per cent. We expect that this goodrecord will be further improved in future, since during 1975 the UK an-nounced that, as part of the new emphasis on helping the poorest, our future government-to-government official development assistance commit-ments to developing countries with a GNP per capita of less than US $200would normally be given as outright grants.5. In 1976 as in previous years the largest single allocation of multi-lateral aid will be for the World Bank Group, and particularly for its soft-lending &quot;window&quot;, the International Development Association (IDA).Most of the IDA&apos;s resources go to the poorest countries, and our continuingsupport for IDA is entirely consistent with our aid strategy. In additionwe shall be contributing to the new &quot;Third Window&quot; for lending on inter-mediate terms. Another substantial part of our multilateral aid goes to finance aid provided for developing countries through the european economic Community, a large part of which is food aid. Strong Britishsupport is given to the United Nations Development Programme and otherUN and relief agencies; and regional development banks are also assistedfrom British aid funds.6. Technical assistance helps developing countries to overcome theirshortage of skilled manpower. It includes support for the education andtraining of local people, the provision of people to do jobs for which thereare insufficient trained people locally, and the support of back-up services &apos;in this country, including those of Government research organisations which are concerned with problems of importance to developing countries of over 11,000 advisers, experts and teachers, and over 2,300 volunteers,as well as training in the United Kingdom of over 9,700 students and 5,000trainees.7. Detailed statistical information for the past five years is given in(he HMSO publication &quot;British Aid Statistics&quot;, and an account of theBritish Aid Programme as provided to the DAC is published as a white paper each year.Overseas aid administration8. This covers the administrative expenses of the Ministry of overseas development (ODM). In addition to the headquarters in London the ODMmaintains five Development Divisions overseas, in the Caribbean (Bridge-town), Middle East (temporarily in Amman), South East Asia (Bangkok),East Africa (Nairobi) and Southern Africa (Blantyre). The cost covers staff,accommodation and official travel both at home and overseas.Overseas representation9. This expenditure covers the cost of the Foreign and commonwealth office (FCO) in London, British diplomatic and consular representation in about 120 countries and 8 official delegations to international organisations and conferences. It covers the cost of staff (excluding those engaged on
information work) as well as their office and private accommodation abroad and official travel. It also includes the cost of the Passport Offices in Londonand other centres and the communications organisation supporting the diplomatic Service.10. Expenditure by the Property Services Agency (PSA) on the Diplo-matic Estate overseas accounts for about 22 per cent of this programme.11. The responsibility of the Diplomatic Service for representing and promoting British interests abroad includes the handling of inter-govern-mental relations; advice on foreign policy; protecting the interests of british nationals abroad; promoting Britain&apos;s visible and invisible exports by assist-ing British commercial organisations and firms and by conducting bilateraland multi-lateral negotiations on international trade and payments;administering overseas Britain&apos;; aid programme and immigration policies;and representing Her Majesty&apos;s Government in international organisations.12. After some increase in 1976-77 largely for the Diplomatic Estate,expenditure will steadily decline over the period covered. These reductionswill be achieved by a more effective concentration of resources, and by cutsin staff and staff related costs and in the Diplomatic Estate. The terms ofreference of a review of overseas representation were announced in Parlia-mCnt on 14 January.Overseas information13.  This programme covers three main elements:(a) The cost of the BBC External Services. These broadcast in english and 39 other languages for over 700 hours a week* to inform thelargest possible foreign audiences about Britain and her role in international affairs. They supply pre-recorded programmes to over-seas broadcasting stations. The expenditure also covers operatingexpenses such as programme staff and engineering costs, and capitalexpenditure on relay stations and on the modernisation of the headquarters at Bush House. Much of the cost of the BBC Monitor-ing Service is also included under this heading.(b) The FCO share of British Council expenditure! to promote widerknowledge of the United Kingdom and the English languageabroad and to foster cultural relations with other countries. Theremainder of the British Council expenditure is included in over-seas aid. The Council is at present represented in 80 countires overseas.(c) The cost of FCO information staff at home and abroad and theiroperational expenses as well as the cost of supporting services provided by the Central Office of Information and the stationery office, and part of external broadcasting relay expenditure. The*See BBC Handbook 1976.see British Council Annual Reports.
aim is to ensure by personal contact, the provision of material in all media and a programme of visits to the United Kingdom,an awareness of Britain&apos;s international role and interests; and tosecure an understanding of and support for the policies of HerMajcsty&apos;s Government, as well as achieving a favourable environ-ment for the promotion of the interests of British business.14. The approximate breakdown of recurrent costs over the period1975-76 to 1979-80 is as follows:(i) BBC External Services 40 per cent(ii) British Council (FCO share) 27 per cent(iii) FCO/COI/HMSO 33 per cent15. Capital expenditure on an agreed list of projects accounts for about.5 per cent of the total over the period 1975-76 to 1979-80.16. As indicated in Cmnd 5879, the overseas information programme was already scheduled to be cut by  1.5 million a year (at 1974 prices) from1975-76 onwards. The provision shown in Table 2.2 has been further re-duced, accentuating the downward trend. Publicity for exports will howevercontinue to receive priority.Other external relations17. The main items of expenditure are certain overseas service pensionsand various international commitments and subscriptions. These includepayments under a Treasury guarantee to the International Bank for Recon-struction and Development (because of default on the part of the Govern-ment of Southern Rhodesia)*; the United Kingdom&apos;s assessed contributions to the regular budgets of United Nations organisations and of the Organis-ation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the Council of europe and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Secretariat costs); and a grant-in-aid to the Commonwealth War Graves commission. Provision has beenmade for the UK&apos;s contribution to the United Nations Emergency Forcein the Middle East in 1975-76 and 1976-77.Military aid18. This programme consists mainly of courses in the UK for overseas service personnel and to a lesser extent the loan of British Service personnel to a few developing countries for training purposes. By comparison withCmnd 5879 annual expenditure under this heading has been reduced by amounts varying between 26 and 15 per cent over the period 1975-76 to1979-80. The figures in Table 2.2 above are net of repayments of earliercapital aid loans.&quot;Session 74-75 HC.319.
Contributions to the European Communities, etc (net)19. The figures in Table 2.2 are made up of two elements. First, theUnited Kingdom&apos;s payments to the budget of the European Communities,net of receipts from the budget and excluding the UK share of expenditure programmes which are included in other functional programmes; second,contributions to the capital and reserves of the European Investment Bank.The full totals of the United Kingdoms payments to the Community budgetare set out in the tables in paragraph 22 below.20. The United kingdom&apos;s contributions to the Community budget are based on the terms of the Treaty of Accession. This provides that the UnitedKingdom&apos;s contribution should rise in steps from 8.78 per cent of the 1973budget to 19.24 per cent of the 1977 budget. Under the provisions of Article131(la) of the Treaty of Accession, the United Kingdom&apos;s contributionto the 1978 and 1979 budget would depend in part on the amount of &quot;own resources&quot; collected in the United Kingdom in 1977. The United Kingdom*contribution to the 1980, and subsequent, budgets will be on the basis ofthe full &quot;own resources&quot; system. For the purpose of these forecasts it hasbeen assumed that the United kingdom&apos;s share of the budgets for 1978 to1980 would be in the order of 21 to 24 per cent.21. Following the conventions used elsewhere in this White Paper,the estimates take account only of expenditure on policies which havealready been agreed. In general they exclude any allowance for policies still under discussion in the Council of Ministers. The estimates are based onthe present budgetary arrangements including the Budget Correcting Mech-anism agreed as part of the renegotiation of the UK&apos;s terms of entry tothe e.c.. The present unit of account conversion rates have been used inthe estimates; in the case of the budget unit of account  1 equals 2.4 unitsof account.22. The latest estimates for the calendar years to 1980 for the UnitedKingdom&apos;s contribution to, and receipts from, the Community budget areas follows:  million gross ContributionReceiptsNet Contribution197319741975197619771978197919801811793424705255856556857714839630531533033035010431-54165210255325325
In financial years to 1979-80, the figures are:  million gross ContributionReceiptsNet Contribution1973-741974-751975-761976-771977-781978-791979-8020019738048053560067010423235531031533035596-3525170220270315(The figures for the current year and future years are at 1975 survey prices; the figures forprior years are at outturn prices. Receipts during 1974-75 and 1975 exceeded contributionslargely due to the high level of payments to the UK under the Common Agricultural Policy;the forecast of the net contribution in 1975-76 has been reduced by comparison with the figure in Cmnd 5879, for the same reason.)23. The budget of the European Communities provides the finance forthe four Community Institutions, the Council of Ministers, the Court ofJustice, the Commission and the European Assembly. The expenditure ofthe Council, Assembly and Court of Justice is almost entirely for theadministrative and running expenses of the three Institutions. The mainCommunity policies (eg the Common Agricultural Policy, the Social Fund,the Regional Development Fund, aid, research) are financed from theCommission^ expenditure which accounts for some 98 per cent of theprovision in the 1976 Community budget. &apos;l24. The Community budget finances a range of expenditure programmes.About three-quarters of the expenditure provided for in the 1976 Com-munity budget is for agricultural support and modernisation under theCommon Agricultural Policy, some 6 per cent is for the European SocialFund which provides support for schemes for training, rehabilitating andredeploying labour, 4 per cent for the Regional Development Fund and3 per cent for aid, mainly in the form of food aid for developing countries.The remainder of the 1976 budget includes provision for the refunds to member states, for the cost of collecting &quot;own resources&quot; (ie customs duties and agricultural levies) from which the Community budget is in partfinanced, for various statistical and other studies, for the salaries andadministrative costs of the four Community Institutions, for research innuclear and other fields and for the European schools, which provide forthe education of children of employees of the European Community Insti-tutions.25. The figures in the final column of the second table in paragraph 22above differ from those in Table 2.2 for two main reasons. The figures in Table 2.2 exclude the UK share of Community budget expenditure programmes, mainly aid, which are included in other functional pro-grammes. They include payments totalling approximately  20 million tothe European Investment Bank following the decision to increase theBank&apos;s capital taken by the Board of Governors in July 1975. The payments will be made in eight equal half-yearly instalments, commencing on 30th &apos;April 1976.
CHANGES IN PROGRAMMED EXPENDITURE26. The main changes since Cmnd 5879 are the lower estimates of ournet contribution to the European Communities (referred to in paragraph22); reduced expenditure on the Diplomatic Service and the DiplomaticEstate (paragraph 12); and reduced expenditure on overseas information services (paragraph 16).

Receipts from this source are included in Table 2.2: overseas aid and other overseas services.1. The transition to full Community support levels under the common agricultural Policy (CAP) will be completed during the survey period. By1978 market support for agricultural products covered by the CAP willbe provided predominantly by Community measures. Other forms of sup-port, including capital grants, will continue during the period under Com-munity measures and national schemes.2. Expenditure in Northern Ireland on price guarantees (except milk and wool), on production and capital support measures, and on support in special areas is included in Programme 15, Northern Ireland.Marker regulation under (he CAP3. This heading includes expenditure borne by the Intervention board for Agricultural Produce in respect of both the CAP and Communityfood aid. The food aid expenditure is funded entirely by advances from theCommunity Budget, and most of the expenditure by the Intervention board under the CAP is covered by advances from the Guarantee Section of theEuropean Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF). the substantial figure forecast for 1975-76 includes  165.2 million for mone-tary compensatory amounts payable on latra-Community and third countrytrade (a large proportion of which benefits consumers) and  94.2 million for the cost of the beef premium scheme, of which  44.2 million is esti-mated a* the EAGGF contribution. The lower figures forecast for 1976-77and later years reflect an expected fall in expenditure on monetary com-pensatory amounts.M

The UK price guarantees for cereals will terminate at the end ofJuly 1976 which is the end of the crop year for cereals. Milk will thenbe the only CAP product supported by a UK price guarantee. The costof implementing the milk guarantee is to be regarded as a consumer subsidyand is accordingly included in the table under &quot;food subsidies&quot;. Thetermination of the cereals guarantees, and high market prices in 1975-76,result in substantial savings on Cmnd 5879.5. For price guarantees of products not covered by the CAP-sheep,wool and potatoes the figures are conventional, being based on a pro-jection of the estimated expenditure in the current year and reflect thedeterminations made following the 1975 Annual Review (Cmnd 5977).Any changes in guaranteed prices following the 1976 Review could affectthe projections.Production grants and subsidies, capital grants and support in special areas6. The forecasts include the increase in the rate of hill sheep subsidyfollowing the 1975 Annual Review. They also make provision for some reduction in production grants and subsidies from 1977-78. From 1 January1976 the CAP system of aids to less-favoured farming areas (partiallyrefunded by EAGGF) replaced the United Kingdom system of support inhill areas but this has had no significant effect on the forecast level ofexpenditure. The figures for production grants and subsidies and for
support in special areas take account of the extent to which grants and subsidies, at fixed rates, lose their value as prices rise. The extent to which that value is restored or improved at subsequent reviews, including the1976 Annual Review, is a charge on the contingency reserve.Relationship of agricultural expenditure to policy objectives7. The Governments agricultural objectives and priorities for the medium term are set out in &quot;Food from our own resources&quot; (Cmnd 6020).The economic condition and prospects of agriculture in the United kingdom are reviewed each year and the Governments conclusions are published in the Annual Review White Paper. This years White Paper if expectedto be published in February 1976. A great deal of supporting information about the industry is contained in the statistical tables appended to theWhite Papers. This information, which relates mainly to the most recent 5 years, provides a detailed anaytsis of the current situation includingindividual commodity trends and developments in farm structure, efficiency and labour productivity, net farm income, and so on.8. The Annual Review does not however attempt to make precise fore-casts for the future of agricultural production, resource use, and anyassociated public expenditure in support of agriculture. Nor are the objec-tives of agricultural support policy defined in terms of specific levels of output. The future level of production depends on decisions on support and on factors which cannot be reliably predicted, such as the weather,world supply and demand for agricultural products and developments in agricultural technology. The large movements in commodity prices inrecent years illustrate the difficulties of prediction.Other assistance to agricultural production, food processingand marketing9. The figures include continuing expenditure by the agricultural depart-ments on agricultural research, advisory services and the eradication andcontrol of animal disease. The major change compared with Cmnd 5879is in respect of sugar. Cmnd 5879 included provision of  150 million in1974-75 for temporary advances to assist sugar refiners with bridging finance for exceptional transactions to ensure supplies, provision for repaymentsbeing made in 1975-76; in the event, advances were fully repaid withinthe 1974-75 financial year, thus removing the provision made for each ofthese years. Payments to the food and agricultural industries have alsobeen higher than forecast in Cmnd 5879. Most of the increase has taken the form of subsidies on food imports, much of which is paid under theCommon Agricultural Policy and offset by receipts from the Budget ofthe European Communities.Central and miscellaneous services10. Central services include the main expenditure by the agricultural departments and the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce on staffcosts and administration of the agricultural programmes. They do not include the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service (attributed to &quot;other assistance to agricultural production&quot;).
11. Miscellaneous services include the staff costs and maintenance ofthe Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, Wakehurst Place and Edinburgh, expen-diture on land management and smallholdings, assistance to crofters inScotland, publicity and miscellaneous grants including payments to inter-national organisations.Fisheries12. This programme mainly comprises grants and loans for new vessels and equipment and grants for the improvement of harbours. Additionalsupport is provided by way of research and development, fishing protection in Scottish waters and, currently, support for trawler operations in the waters off Iceland. The 1975-76 figure also includes provision for thetemporary fishing subsidy in 1975.Relationship of fisheries expenditure to policy objectives13. The general objective of this programme is to ensure a regular supplyof fish for consumers by maintaining a fishing fleet of such size and typeas will be best able to exploit efficiently the resources available to it, and reduce dependence on imports. The conditions in which the industry willbe operating in future will be heavily influenced by the outcome of theUnited Nations Law of the Sea Conference and developments in theCommon Fisheries Policy of the e.c., including projected common actionfoe the restructuring of Community fishing fleets.14. UK landings of fresh and frozen fish (including shellfish) in 1973and 1974 were between 900,000 and 1 million tons. They accounted for about 85 per cent of total supplies, excluding canned fish. The fishingfleet provides direct employment for about 20,000 full time and neatly5,000 part time people. In each case roughly half are employed in Englandand Wales the remainder in Scotland. Whilst the character of the fleet was changing during 1974 and 1975 about 6,500 vessels continued tofish regularly.Forestry15. This item covers the Forestry Commission^ activities in promoting the interests of forestry, the establishment and maintenance of adequate re-serves of growing trees and the production and supply of timber. the commissions activities divide between the Forestry Enterprise (a Govern-ment Trading Service) and the Forestry Authority. The forecasts includeinterest on capital (increasing from  27.7 million to  33.2 million) and depreciation.16. The demand upon resources is measured by the cost of capital employed by the Forestry Commission at the ruling Government ratesof interest and by cash expenditure. Towards the cost of capital employedthere is a subsidy to cover the difference between the target rate of return of 3 per cent set by the Government and the ruling Government lendingrate and there are other subsidies on activities which are not capable of producing the target rate but which the Commission undertakes for socialreasons.
17. The Forestry Enterprise is carrying out a combined planting andrestocking programme of up to 22,000 hectares a year. Over the five-year period of the Survey the forest estate will increase from about 810,000hectares to 900,000 hectares with a plantable reserve of about 90,000hectares. Approximately 665 kilometres of new roads will be constructedand about 9.2 million cubic metres of timber harvested. The Commissionprovides substantial recreational facilities including camping sites and self catering accommodation, information centres, picnic places and view-points with associated parking facilities, forest walks and nature trails.18. As the Forestry Authority, the Commission undertakes research into aU branches of forestry, controls felling in private woodlands and provides technical advice to private woodland owners. The Commissionpays grants for planting of timber-producing species subject to the accept-ance by the owner of obligations relating to the management of the wood-lands designed to secure sound forestry practice, good land use, environ-mentai benefits and opportunities for recreation. Private planting undergrant schemes has been about 22,000 hectares a year for the last few years.19. The net surplus on Commission trading accounts was previouslydeducted from total expenditure for Survey purposes. As a consequenceof a change in classification to conform to National Accounts principlesit now forms part of the Gross Trading Surplus which is not reflected in the Survey figures. The increases in total expenditure solely attributable to this change range from  4.2 million in 1975-76 to  7.0 million in 1979-80.This does not lead to an increase in the cash requirement.FoodnMdfes20. The Programme of consumer subsidies to hold down prices of certainfoodstuffs in the UK is carried out under Section 1 of the Prices Acts 1974and 1975. Subsidies are currently paid on bread, butter, cheese, householdflour, milk and tea.21. These subsidies are currently estimated to reduce the Food Indexby 5*8 points (4 per cent) and the saving on the Retail Price Index is esti-mated to be 1-3 points (0-9 per cent). It is estimated from the results ofNational Food Survey for the second quarter of 1975 that the saving for atypical family of two adults and two children is about 71p a week, and almost 45p a week for a pensioner couple.22. The Exchequer contribution towards the general butter sudsidy(87-7 million in 1975-76) is borne on the vote of the Department of prices and Consumer Protection and an additional contribution of  19 million is paid by the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce from the Guaran-tee Section of the EAGGF.
CHANGES IN PROGRAMMED EXPENDITUREAgriculture23. The 1974-75 outturn for market regulation under the CAP was greater than forecast mainly because of increases in the payment of monetarycompensatory amounts in the form of import subsidies on Intra-community and third country trade. In addition the substantial payments during 1974-75of the special import subsidy on sugar amounting to  35-9 million were notforecast in Cmnd 5879. The changes from 1975-76 onwards reflect thehigher level of import subsidies and the inclusion of forecast provisions forbeef support arrangements. There are reductions in expenditure on other agricultural support and these reductions mainly arise on price guarantees.Food subsidies24. In line with the Chancellor^ statement in the Budget that the food subsidies programme would be reduced, expenditure will be substantially below the levels envisaged in Cmnd 5879. The reductions amount to:These figures allow for the addition to the provision for 1976-77 of  70million made in &quot;The Attack on Inflation&quot; (Cmnd 6151).Other changes25. A major change is fn the provision for sugar arrangements in 1974-75, 1975-76 and 1976-77. Other significant changes are due to temporarymeasures in support of the fishing industry and the ^classification ofForestry Commission trading accounts.1976-7712691977-781809  million at 1975 Survey prices1978-79284

This programme covers expenditure aimed at encouraging thedevelopment of industry, and maintaining employment, in the assisted areas. Regional development grants are made available under Part 1 ofthe Industry Act 1972, and Section 7 of that Act provides a flexible schemeof selective assistance by means of loans and grants. The regional employ-ment premium has been continued. The provision of factories continues asdoes the use of industrial development certificates to encourage the loca-tion of new or expanding industrial activities in the assisted areas. TheScottish and Welsh Development Agencies have been set up to accelerate the economic and industrial development of Scotland and Wales and toimprove the environment consistently with that objective.Regional development grants2. Regional development grants under Part 1 of the Industry Act 1972are made towards the cost of buildings and plant and machinery at therate of 22 per cent in the special development areas and 20 per centin development areas. Grants are also made at 20 per cent towards thecost of buildings in the intermediate areas and in the case of a building orof any works provided before 22 March 1974, in the derelict land clearanceareas.Provision of land and buildings3. In addition to expenditure under existing policies for land purchase and factory building in England, the forecasts include the additional expenditure on advance factory building and modernisation included mthe package of measures to alleviate unemployment announced by theGovernment on 24 September 1975. Land purchase and factory building in Scotland and Wales is included under Scottish and Welsh DevelopmentAgencies (see paragraph 5).Selective assistance to industry in the assisted areas4. Assistance under Section 7 of the Industry Act 1972 is available on a selective basis to industry in the development and intermediate areas to supplement the basic regional incentives which include regional develop-ment grants and regional employment premiums. For projects which provide

Removal grants are also available when a firm is moving into an assisted area. The forecasts are lower than Cmnd5879 owing to the transfer of provision to &quot; Assistance to the shipbuudineindustry *&apos;.Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies5. These new provisions reflect expenditure programmes of  260million for the Scottish Development Agency and  100 million for thoWelsh Development Agency over five years. The main objectives of the agencies will be to accelerate the economic and industrial development ofScotland and Wales and to improve the environment consistently with thatobjective. In particular they will have the task of establishing or helping to establish new industrial enterprises; and of planning, developing, maiu-taining, and managing industriaJ estates in Scotland and Wales and ofproviding advance and purpose built factories. This calls for expandingprogrammes of expenditure. The Agencies wfli also expand the derelictland clearance programmes and they will undertake major environmentalschemes.Regional employment premium6. Regional employment premium is under review. The forecastsassume the continual payment of the premium to manufacturing industryin development areas.Residual expenditure under repealed sections of the Local EmploymentAct 19727. Outstanding commitments to pay building grants and grants underSection 4 of the Act are estimated to be higher than in Cmnd 5879 ft Isnow expected that payments will be completed during 1977-78.Industrial innovationGeneral industrial research and development8. Expenditure under tftts programme covers the Department ofIhdustry&apos;s Industrial Research Establishments (IREs) and the Computer
Aided Design Centre, contract support for industrial research associations,and other extra mural research and development. The greater part of this expenditure is now managed through the Requirements Boards set up to implement the customer/contractor relationship as recommended in&quot;Framework for Government Research and Development&quot; (Cmnd 5046).9. The IREs include three multi-purpose laboratories (National PhysicalLaboratory, National Engineering Laboratory and Warren SpringLaboratory) and a more specialised establishment, the Laboratory of theGovernment Chemist. In addition to their work for the RequirementsBoards IREs undertake work for Government departments, for other public authorities and for industry. Their activities are expected to continue at broadly the present level over the period to 1979-80.10. Expenditure on research and development contracts with industry,which are usually carried out on a cost sharing basis, is mainly on ship and Marine Technology. It is expected that this work will continue to grow. There will also be increasing emphasis on energy conservation,waste reclamation, and on the dissemination of new technology devolped in Government establishments. Support for the industrial research associa-tions, which increases substantially over the period, now takes the form of contracts rather than grants. Grants-in-aid will continue to be made at approximately the current level to the Design Council and the NationalComputing Centre, and provision is made for repayment work at the atomic energy Authority and National Environment Research Council.11. The forecasts for this programme show a decrease on Cmnd 5879,reflecting its contribution to public expenditure savings.12. Expenditure by the Department of Energy includes offshoregeological studies, work to support the Departments statutory responsi-bilities for the safety of offshore installations and research and develop-ment to promote the competitiveness of British industry in the field ofoffshore oil and gas operations. It also includes the Departments contribu-tions to certain research and development programmes carried out underthe auspices of the International Energy Agency. The Department alsoproposes to commission further work on new energy sources and on energyconservation.Technological and industrial sponsorship13. This programme is controlled by the Department of Industry, and includes cost-sharing research and development contracts, pre-productionpurchases of advanced machinery and equipment and assistance to mineralexploration under the Mineral Exploration and Investment Grants Act1972. Grant-in-aid support is given to the National Computing Centre forsoftware development projects and provision is also made for certain pay-ments to the National Research Development Corporation under SectionII of the Development of Inventions Act 1967.Aircraft and aeroengine projects and assistance14. A Bui has been presented to Parliament for the nationalisation ofthe aircraft industry. Subject to the passage of this legislation the Govern-
ment will be concerned with the finance required for the new nationalised industry-British Aerospace to carry on its business, and not only, as atpresent, with the Government contribution to specific projects (see Chapter5, paragraph 4).Aircraft and aeroengine general research and development15. Provision is made for research and experimental development inthe fields of airframes. aero engines and aircraft equipment; this includeswork on the reduction of aircraft noise and exhaust pollution. About halfof the work is carried out at Government R and D establishments, and therest in industry or universities. Subject to the passage of the Aircraft and shipbuilding Industries Bill British Aerospace will in due course take over responsibility for that part of this expenditure relevant to its activities.Concorde16. The provision includes the United Kingdom share of the cost of the authorised programme of 16 aircraft, the development work required to achieve the certificate of airworthiness issued in the United Kingdom on  December 1975, work by the manufacturers to support the aircraft inairline service, and receipts from sales of aircraft and spares.RB21117 The Government financed development programme for the RB2I1-22 and the production of the first 555 engines for the Lockheed TriStarhave now reached the stage when receipts are exceeding expenditure. Pro-duction of these engines will be completed in 1976-77. In September 1974the Government announced support for the development of the more powerful RB2U-524 for the TriStar, and in June 1975 further supportwas announced for the application of the engine to the Boeing 747.Other aircraft and aeroengine projects and assistance is The estimates include provision of working capital for Rolls Royce0971) Ltd up to and including 1975-76. The shares of the Company axeshortly to be transferred to the National Enterprise Board, after which thelatter will assume responsibility for meeting any further working capital requirements. The estimates cover also support for the HS146 project onthe basis announced by the Secretary of State for Industry on 9 December1974 and for the M45H engine; payments to the Ministry of defence procurement Executive) for headquarters services on behalf of the Depart-* nt industry and receipts from levies on sales of civil aircraft andenSes, other than Concorde and the RB211, developed with Governmentsupports?iq The forecasts provide, principally, for the main part of the UnitedKinriom-s contribution to the European Space Agency which has assumedSJSn;  for DTogrammes formerly undertaken by the European SpaceSS^McMr paragraph 11.) The contribution covers the UK&apos;s share fiTthe Agency&apos;s applications programmes Oe aeronaut.cal, meteoro-
logical, telecommunications and maritime satellites), the Space Laboratoryand the Ariane Launcher Technology. The contribution for 1978-79 hasbeen reduced, compared with Cmnd 5879, for it is now assumed that the uk will contribute on a less generous scale than at present to any replace-ment projects once the present applications programmes are completed.Provision is also made for continuing commitments to a small NationalSpace Technology programme to be carried out partly in industry andpartly in the form of research and development work at the Royal aircraft establishment The purpose of this programme is to support the UK spaceindustry in maintaining its competitive position.Nuclear energy20. Most of this expenditure is for research and development work bythe Atomic Energy Authority in support of the development of nuclear power stations. This includes continuing research in support of the AdvancedGas Cooled Reactor programme, the development programme for thecommercial Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor and work on a demonstration fast reactor. Expenditure on the safety aspects of these programmes and other miscellaneous nuclear services, including the inter-national centrifuge project for enriching uranium, and the provision ofadditional capital to British Nuclear Fuels Ltd, is also covered.General support for industry21. Provision is made for capital investment by way of share aqutsitionand loans by the National Enterprise Board (not). At the present stagethis provision is inevitably arbitrary and will need to be kept under review.It is based on an allocation, shown in Table 2.4 in cash terms, of the 1,000 million provided for under the Industry Act 1975, less a notionalallowance for other claims on the statutory provision. The  1,000 million will not however be the only important source of funds for not coro-panies, who themselves will be eligible to receive assistance under theIndustry Act 1972 as for instance British Leyland Ltd (see paragraph22 below).Selective assistance to individual industries, firms and undertakings22. Expenditure by the Department of Industry under Section S of theIndustry Act 1972 includes the  100 million for accelerated capital invest-ment and industry support schemes announced in the 1975 budget, thefurther  130 million earmarked for these purposes as part of the measuresto curb unemployment and promote investment announced since September1975, and assistance to the Wool Textile Industry announced in 1973.Provision has been made for support to certain individual Anns, including 200 million support for British Layland Ltd over the period. This will be additional to the  247 million for the purchase of equity in British LeylandLtd under the British Leyland Act 1975 and to the  300 million which is assumed to be required from the funds available to the National Enterprise
Board (see paragraph 21). The Government has agreed to provide Chrysler(UK) Ltd with a loan of  55 million in support of the company&apos;s investment programme; to meet possible losses over the period to 1979 up to a maximum of  72-5 million, and to guarantee a private sector loan of  35 million (witha counter-guarantee from the Chrysler Corporation). Provision has been included for the loan of  55 million, and for possible losses in 1975-76 and1976-77 of  40 million. Any additional expenditure on meeting losses orexpenditure under the guarantee would be a call on the contingency reserve.23. Provision is also made for the  40 million assistance to InternationalComputers (Holdings) Ltd under the Science and Technology Act 1965during the period 1972-73 to 1976-77. The forecasts for 1978-79 and1979-80 include initial repayments by ICL.24. Expenditure by the Department of Energy includes payments underthe Offshore Supplies Interest Relief Grant Scheme and assistance forprojects already approved under Section 8 of the Industry Act 1972 insupport of companies involved in supplying goods and services for offshoreoil and gas operations. Any further projects under Section 8 would be acall on the contingency reserve.Promotion of tourism25. This heading includes grants-in-aid to the British Tourist authority and the English, Scottish and Wales Tourist Boards; expenditure on touristprojects in the development areas under Section 4 of the Development of tourism Act 1969; and, up to 1975-76, provision for assistance to the hotelindustry under Part II of that Act. More detailed information about theexpenditure of the statutory tourist organisations may be found in their annual reports- The policy guide lines for tourism announced in November1974 are intended to shift resources from the generalised promotion of tourism, towards the development of tourism in areas of untapped potential,particularly in development areas. The financial implications of these changes are being considered but have not yet been finalised.Refinancing of home shipbuilding lending26.  The Department of Industry refinances a proportion ftfprovided by the clearing banks under the home sh^ETcrerfl   ?*&apos;to UK purchasers of ships built in UK shipyards The refSfn^, Xhemements operate in conjunction with the refinancing arrant ^nge-credit (see paragraph 36). The forecast for 1975-76 inXS   . .&quot;Portthe Department of Industry to take over the remainder of f0rrefinancing which was provided by the Issue Department of a. t.    ofEngland under earlier arrangements.                                mc Ban* ofAssistance to the shipbuilding industry27.  Subject to the passage of the Aircraft and ShJDbufldmo- t a  . .Bill a large part of the shipbuilding industry will soon beT nat?capital expenditure programme of the nationalised1 mdiistry will therHeatur
in Programme 5 (see Chapter 5, paragraph 4). Provision is made here forcertain limited and continuing expenditure by the Government under theIndustry Act 1972. It covers, first, current commitments, largely for capital reconstruction programmes, to Govan Shipbuilders Ltd, Cammell LairdLtd, Sunderland Shipbuilders Ltd, Austin and Pickersgill Ltd and certainsmaller shipbuilders. Secondly, it includes a provision of  15 million a year from 1976-77 onwards, which has not yet been committed but which islikely to be needed as continuing special assistance to the industry. the forecasts also include repayments of loans made under the 1972 Act andalso under the Shipbuilding Credit Act 1964 and the Shipbuilding industry act 1967.Other support services28. Expenditure by the Department of Energy includes the EnergySavings Loan Scheme, the development of construction sites for offshoreoil and gas production platforms and a hydrographic survey to identifyroutes suitable for towing platforms to their production positions. other items (which are the responsibility of various departments) includeaccelerated expenditure on machine tools, which will cease at the end of1975-76, and receipts from miscellaneous loan repayments; the latter includeloans made in respect of the QE2 and to the aluminium industry, and loansmade by the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation. Provision is made foradvances of loan capita) to the National Film Finance Corporation.Investment Grants29. Residual expenditure arises from contracts entered into by companiesbefore 27 October 1970.Other information30. The Annual Report on the Industry Act 1972 contains a more detailed breakdown of expenditure under this Act and on regional assistancegenerally, together with further background information.Compensation for price restraint31. Subsidies for price restraint in 1975-76 are equivalent at outturn prices to  100 million. In accordance with the Government^ policy ofphasing out the subsidies by the end of 1975-76, no provision js made for future years.Support for nationalised industries (other than the transport industries)Assistance to the Coal Industry32. In line with the policy of phasing out subsidies to the nationalised industries, no provision has been made for grants to the National coal board for 1975-76 onwards, apart from certain social subsidies to helpformer employees.33. The Government undertook in the Final Report of the Coal IndustryExamination of 1974 to assist in meeting the existing deficiency in the mineworkers&apos; Pension Fund. Following an actuarial assessment of this deficiency, the Government has agreed to make 20 annual payments of 18 million and the National Coal Board (Finance) Bill now before
Parliament makes provision for these. In addition the Government financesa special scheme for payments to redundant miners.Other compensation34. The Department of Energy and the Scottish Office pay compen-sation to the Electricity Boards in England and Wales and to the BritishGas Corporation under the 1972 scheme for the acceleration of capital investment to maintain employment. Provision is also made for payment by the Scottish Office in 1976-77 to the North of Scotland Hydro ElectricBoard towards its accumulated losses under the 1968 contract for thesupply of electricity to the British Aluminium Company at Invergordonand, in subsequent years for losses expected to be incurred. This head-ing also covers payments by the Department of Industry under the schemefor assisting steelworkers made redundant since January 1973 to trainfor other employment. Up to half the cost will be reimbursed from the eec budget and these receipts will be credited to &quot;Contributions to theEuropean Communities etc (net)&quot; under Programme 2.International tradeExport promotion and trade co-operation35. This covers the Export Promotion programme, directed by theBritish Overseas Trade Board, and subscriptions to international trade organisations. The greater part of the expenditure represents assistance toBritish firms exhibiting at overseas trade fairs, but also covers a numberof other export promotion services including assistance to overseas market-ing, research and education and training for overseas trade. Increasedreceipts are forecast from 1975-76 to take account of increased rentals forspace at trade fairs.Refinancing of fixed rate export credits36. The Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) refinances a proportion of the credit provided by the clearing banks for periods of 2years or more, the proportion depending on the level of their non-interest-bearing sterling &quot;sight&quot; deposits. A similar arrangement exists for ship-building (see paragraph 26 above). The figures are considerably higher,particularly in the later years, than those in Cmnd 5879 reflecting theincrease in export advances which will result from the higher level ofbusiness recently insured and expected future increases in business andadvances. The figure for 1975-76 includes provision for ECGD to take overthe remainder of a block of refinancing provided by the Issue Departmentof the Bank of England under previous arrangements.Cost Escalation Scheme37. The ECGD is empowered by the Export Guarantees Act 1975 toprovide insurance against increases in certain costs of performing exportcontracts involving major capital goods. This expenditure represents theextent to which both payments under the scheme to exporters (which willnot begin before 1977-78), and administration costs are expected to exceed the income from premia. The forecasts of expenditure are subject to considerable uncertainty since they depend on the rate of cost increases, the
demand for the scheme, and the extent to which exporters are successful in winning overseas contracts.Regulation of domestic trade and industry and consumer protection38. Provision is made for expenditure by the Department of Trade for thePatent Office (including expenditure in connection with the setting up ofthe European Patent Office), and associated international subscriptions; andfor the Departments Insurance and Companies Divisions and InsolvencyService. Account is taken of increased income from higher fees for theservices provided by the Patent and the Companies Registration Offices.39. Provision has also been made for a Government loan to the AirTravel Reserve Fund Agency under the Air Travel Reserve Fund Act 1975;and for grant assistance to the Steering Group on Inflation Accountingset up following the report of the Sandilands Committee on InflationAccounting (Cmnd 6225).40. The forecasts also include expenditure by the Department of prices and Consumer Protection (DPCP) on the Monopolies and Mergers Corn-mission, the National Consumer Council, the National Council of social service and other services for theprotection of the consumer. As indicatedin &quot;The Attack on Inflation&quot; (Cmnd 6151, para 32) additional fundshave been made available to finance more consumer advice centres, to give further support to Citizens&apos; Advice Bureaux, and for local price compari-sons. Provision is also made for work on standards and quality assurance,the latter including the grant-in-aid to the British Standards Institution, andthe cost of the Metrication Board.41. Included in DPCP programmes for the first time is the cost of fiveNationalised Industry Consumer Councils covering domestic coal, electricity,gas, Post Office and transport; the grant-in-aid to the Royal Society for thePrevention of Accidents; and expenditure on research on the safety of consumer goods. Responsibility for the last two items has been transferred from other departments,42. Lastly, the programme provides for the statutory functions of theOffice of Fair Trading with respect to monopolies and mergers, restrictive trade practices, consumer protection and consumer credit. expenditure incurred in the administration of the Consumer Credit Act will be met fromfees.Functioning of the labour market43. This programme aims to improve the functioning of the labour market through the services provided by the Department of employment and the Manpower Services Commission. It includes expenditure by localauthorities on the Careers Service. The expenditure of the Commission andits two executive arms, the Employment Service Agency (ESA) and theTraining Services Agency (TSA), is financed by grant-in-aid.
44. Certain schemes for training, employment transfer, rehabilitation of thehandicapped and career development of young people are eligible for assistancefrom the European Social Fund. These receipts are taken into account in&quot;Contributions to the European Communities etc (net)&quot; in Table 2.2.Manpower Services Commission45. The Commission is directly responsible for carrying out its functionwithin a general policy framework agreed with the Secretary of State for employment. Additional resources have been made available to the Corn-mission in 1975-76 and 1976-77 to provide improved and expanded employ-ment and training facilities to mitigate the effects of higher unemployment.The Commission is also undertaking, on behalf of the Department, the operationof the Job Creation Programme which aims to provide short term jobs of socialvalue for unemployed persons and particularly for unemployed young people.Employment services and employment rehabilitation46. The main expenditure is on the placing service of the ESA. An important element in the Agency&apos;s plans for improving its services to the labour market and to employers and job seekers is the programme for establishing job-centres in place of traditional Employment Exchanges. Some 70 jobcentreswere opened by the end of 1974-75 and the scale of their activities continuesto rise significantly. The programme for 1975-76 and 1976-77 has been acceleratedand it is expected to open 250 jobcentres in the course of those years and tocontinue at about 100 centres a year until 1980. Improvements to the service are also being achieved by increasing the professionalism of employmentadvisers, by appropriate specialisation and by improving organisation. Special-ised placing services are provided for disabled persons within the employmentservices together with rehabilitation facilities for about 14,000 persons a year in various types of Employment Rehabilitation Centres. Professional and executive Recruitment (PER) aims to achieve financial self sufficiencyin the forecast period.47. The following table gives figures for past years and projected figures for future years of vacancies notified, registrations and placings. Changes in labour market conditions significantly affect the year to year results and the figuresfor future years cannot take account of these variations. The projectionsassume a steady improvement which is expected to flow from the developmentof ESA services.1970-71 1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75					1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-80				1.

48. As part of the Governmenfs special measures for alleviating higherunemployment, the grants and facilities under the Employment TransferScheme have been considerably enhanced as a means of assisting labourmobility in 1975-76 and 1976-77. These improvements are reflected in theincreased numbers of persons expected to be assisted to transfer in future years as shown in the following table.Thotuattii	1970-71	1971-72 1S72-73 1973-74 1974-73	1973-76 1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-80Truufbr Scheme) U) AmImmS Aim OUut Aieu   .	5&apos;2 .     2-0	31      15&apos;0      14-0      12-7 3&apos;2       3-6       XO       2&apos;4	14&apos;3      ST 5      19-0      190      19-0 2-3       40       y$        J&apos;5        3&apos;5Total   ...

Responsibility for the Careers Service has now passed to local authoritiesin England, Wales and Scotland. Provision has however been made for grants to local authorities to strengthen the Service and for payment to employers ofa recruitment subsidy for school leavers in 1975-76 and 1976-77.Industrial training50. The TSA is responsible for carrying out industrial training policymainly through the Training Opportunities Scheme. Adult training is provided in Skillccntres, colleges of further education, employers&apos; establishments,residential colleges for the disabled and other institutions. The average lengthof the courses varies according to the establishment and the type of course. InSkillcentxes courses last on the average for about 28 weeks but the majorityof courses are slightly shorter. In colleges of further education most courseslast for two terms or about 26 weeks and in employers&apos; establishments for about 10 weeks. The following table shows the number of people trained, asexpected to be trained in these three types of establishment.Thdofcudt1970-71	1971-72 1973-73 1973-74 1974-73				1973-76 1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1974-80			Number Trained						23	23	(!) maetauei    ...    173	13&apos;6	IJB	171	17&apos;3	20			27        30(11) College! of Further					33	47	47	Education      ...     ]&apos;0	2&apos;1	93	17&apos;8	D-5				30        34(ill) Etnplowi&apos; Ettftb [oAtrMCts        . 	0-7	6-0	S&apos;4	6&apos;7	9	10	10	10        10Toui ......  trt	16-4	31-3	40-3	49-5	62	80	82	87        9451. The TSA also encourages the development of training in industry byfunding the administrative expenses of Industrial Training Boards, by grantaiding the costs of certain of their key training schemes and by meeting thecost of providing training services to sectors of employment not covered byIndustrial Training Boards.52. Additional provision has been made to assist apprentice and othertraining in a variety of ways in 1975-76 and 1976-77 and to increase significantlythe volume of direct training during a period of high unemployment.Redundancy Fund payments53. Payments were made from the Fund to 210,000 people in 1974-75compared with 388,000 in 1971-72, 262,000 in 1972-73 and 157,000 in 1973-74.
The forecasts assume a level of payments in 1975-76 similar to that in 1971-72and a gradual redaction thereafter. They also include the additional expenditurearising from the provision of the Employment Protection Act for safeguardingsums due to employees in cases where employers are insolvent.Industrial relations and other labour market services54. This heading covers the cost of Department of Employment staff engaged on general manpower, economic policy (manpower), industrial relations and incomes together with the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service(ACAS), the Office of Manpower Economics, an employment appeal tribunal and industrial tribunals. Under the provisions of the Employment ProtectionAct ACAS set up as a statutory body financed by a grant-in-aid from I January1976 and the Central Arbitration Committee and the Certification Officerfrom 1 February 1976. Provision is also made for continuing and expanding the Community Industry Scheme which employs previously unemployed young people on tasks of social value. An expansion to 3,000 places is planned for1975-76 and a further 1,000 places are being added temporarily in 1976-77 to mitigate the effects of higher unemployment.Central and flriseeUaneon services55. This heading covers the central salaries and general administrative expenses of the Department of Energy, the Department of Industry, includingRegional Offices, together with those of the Departments of Trade and prices and Consumer Protection, and the expenses of the Prices Commission. also included are subscriptions to international postal and telecommunicationsorganisations.56. The heading also covers Department of Employment expenditure on services for seriously disabled people, the Health and Safety Commission,international relations work (mainly the subscription to the InternationalLabour Office), the Royal Commission on the Distribution of Income andWealth and central and common services not attributable to other employmentprogrammes.57. Services to seriously disabled persons consist mainly of grants towardsthe cost of Remploy Limited, local authorities and other bodies which providedemployment under sheltered conditions. The average number of workerscovered are as follows: Thouwdi	1970-71 1971-72 1972-73 1873-74 1974-75	197J-T6 1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-80fflKM*toLtf   .

WO      14&apos;JThe main policy aims set out in the consultative document Sheltered Employ-ment for Disabled People have commanded wide support and the Governmenthas decided that these aims will best be achieved by the Manpower Services Corn-mission taking over administration and co-ordinating functions in this field.
58. Since the inception of both the Health and Safety Commission and executive the Commission has been engaged in bringing together the variousinspectorates concerned with occupational safety and health services and in planning work related to the new responsibilities placed on it by the Health and safety at Work Act 1974 which extended the protection of the Act to some 8million employees not previously covered.CHANGES IN PROGRAMMED EXPENDITURE59. As explained in Part 1 of this White Paper (paragraph 16) the Govern-ment is giving priority to improving industrial productivity and efficiency.Substantial additions have therefore been made to this programme comparedwith the programmes published in Cmnd 5879. The main changes are as follows:(i) The provision for capital investment by the National Enterprise Board(paragraph 21).(ii) Assistance to British Layland Ltd (in addition to that from not);and to Chrysler (UK) Ltd (paragraph 22).(iii) Provision for accelerated investment and industrial modernisationschemes.(iv) Additional expenditure by the Scottish and Welsh DevelopmentAgencies (paragraph 5).(v) The forecasts for regional development grants are lower, except in1975-76 where expenditure has been affected by earlier application for grants (paragraph 2).(vi) Estimates for the refinancing of export lending are much higher than in cmnd 5879 because of increases in export advances resulting from thehigh level of business recently insured (paragraph 36).(vii) Within tbe functioning of the labour market programme the ia-creases in expenditure largely reflect the cost of the Governmentsmeasures to combat increased unemployment. These include improved and expanded employment and training services, expansion of tbeCommunity Industry Scheme, the recruitment subsidy for the employ-ment of school leavers, the strengthening of the Careers Service, thetemporary employment subsidy for deferred redundancies and the JobCreation Programme.

Leaving aside the new provision for the British National Oil Corporation,total expenditure by the nationalised industries is down in each of the years1976-77 lo 1978-79 by comparison with the forecasts in last year&apos;s White Paper.It is higher in 1975-76 when there is increased expenditure of  280 million onstocks (shown under &quot;Other Capital Expenditure&quot;), nwinly as the result of the2,589.5        2^25.9        2,330.079.7 28.0 189.32,669.2        i553!9        2J19T

Experience shows that overall actual ex-penditure turns out to be less than forecast and so there is, as in previous white papers, a global deduction for shortfall in each year on the total programme ofexpenditure on fixed assets.2. The new forecasts provide for expenditure on fixed assets to remain ataround the same level from 1976-77 to 1978-79 and then to grow a little in
19*79-80. However, within the totals the programmes of individual industriesshow some important changes as a result of this year&apos;s review. Further provision has now been made for the modernisation of the coal industry in accordancewith &quot;Plan for Coal&quot;. Capital investment for the generation of electricity inEngland and Wales is to be reduced substantially; the latest forecasts of demand in the early 1980s mean that fewer new power-stations need be started in the mid-1970s, The modernisation programme for the steel industry, which got off to a slow start, is expected to go ahead much faster in the last three years of theperiod and increased provision has been made. Investment in telecommunications-cations is likely to be lower as a result of slackening demand: the figures will bekept under review in the light of market forecasts but in the meantime they are put at a constant level. Similarly, investment in British Railways is to be heldsteady, outside the areas of passenger transport authorities.3. Following acceptance by the National Economic Development Council ofa report on nationalised industry investment by a joint departmental/industryworking party, the Government took steps to improve the procedures for ap-proving nationalised industry programmes. The aim is to give greater certaintyto the industries, and in turn to their suppliers, about future programmes, andso far as possible to achieve greater stability in levels of investment and greaterconfidence among suppliers. This year nearly all industries were given approval to their capital programmes in the autumn, and were authorised to commit up to100 per cent of approved expenditure in 1976-77, 85 per cent of approved ex-penditure in 1977-78 and 70 per cent in 1978-79; figures for 1979-80 remainplanning figures. It is intended to follow a similar timetable and procedure infuture years.Aircraft and shipbuilding4. No provision is included at this stage for expenditure by British Aero-space and British Shipbuilders, which will be established subject to the passageof the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill now before Parliament. It is too early to assess what the capital expenditure of the two corporations will be.This expenditure will become a call on the contingency reserve when estimates are available after the Organising Committees have considered their future plans.Preliminary indications arc that the total capital expenditure, including ad-ditions to stocks and work in progress, for both corporations together might beas follows:   mjHion at 1975 Survey prices1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-8030 50 60 70The figures do not include expenditure on R &amp; D, which is of particularsignificance for British Aerospace, because it is not classified as capital ex-penditure.FuelCoal5. There are two substantial changes in the estimates of capital expenditure by the National Coal Board (NCB). First, they are no longer providing for investment in NCB (Exploration) Ltd. This company is engaged in the develop-ment of North Sea oil and gas fields and was acquired by the British NationalOil-Corporation in January 1976. Secondly, the remaining programmeprovides
for total expenditure in the period 1975-76 to 1978-79 of  892 million comparedwith  536 million in Cmnd 5879. This increase results from a more detailedcosting of the mining programme set out in the NCB&apos;s Plan for Coal. The aim isto provide new capacity of 42 million tons a year by 1985 22 million tons byexpanding existing capacity and 20 million tons from new pits.6.  In addition to expenditure on fixed assets, there is provision for additionalworking capital of about  165 million to finance an increase in stocks in 1975-76.Financial assistance for the Board&apos;s current account is described in Chapter 4,. (paragraphs 32 and 33).Electricity7. The programme has been prepared in the light of the forecast made by theElectricity Council and the Scottish Electricity Boards last April that the simal-taneous maximum demand would reach 63 thousand MW in 1981-82; comparedwith the 1974 forecast of 65.1 thousand MW by 1979-80. The latest figure reflectsa further reduction in electricty demand growth consequent upon the currentreduction in industrial activity, higher energy prices (in line with the Govern-menfs objective to restore energy prices to realistic levels as soon as possible),and moves towards energy conservation.8. This level of demand, plus a 20 per cent planning margin to cover, eg&apos;the risk of plant breakdowns in cold weather when demand is at its highest, canbe met from the power stations now in service and those under construction.This capital investment programme therefore makes no provision in the early part of the period for the ordering of any major new power stations other thanthe programme Of 4,000 MW capacity to be provided from power stations usingsteam generating heavy water reactors as announced by the Secretary of Statefor Energy in July 1974. The first of these is duetto come into operation in1983-84. In addition to the construction costs of these stations, provision hasbeen made for other costs associated with development for commercialoperation of this new type of reactor.9. The programme of expenditure on transmission and distribution hassimilarly been revised by the Boards since last year. This expenditure is more closely related to forecasts of local demand and economic activity two or threeyears ahead and is sensitive to new housing and industrial development such asthe North Sea Oil related development in Scotland. c10. Current North Sea fields are producing at or near their plateau rate, andno large increases in supplies to consumers will be available until the arrival of gas from the Frigg field, probably in late 1977, followed by oil-assocjatedgas from the Brent field about 2-3 years later. Sales in recent years, and indica-tions of possible sales for future years, are as Tollows:GasDomestic ...Commercial,Industrial ...Total gas sold,487    12,932    13,500    14,100    15,300    16,700   &apos; 48,000
Sales of gas during 1974-75 were 12-13 per cent higher than in the previous year in the domestic, commercial and industrial markets. Estimates of salesduring 1975-76 have been revised downwards since Cmnd 5879 mainly because of the reduced levels of industrial activity. Reductions in fore-casts for later years reflect the delays in bringing in new offshore supplies.11. There are no significant changes in the indush7*s investment programmecompared with that set out is Cmnd 5879. There will be a reduction in expendi-ture in 1976-77 as a result of early pipe deliveries and a corresponding increase mexpenditure in 1975-76. The footnote to Table 2.5 refers to a change in the accouting treatment of replacement expenditure: this involves no change in thelevel of such expenditure.British National Oil Corporation (BNOC)12. Cmnd 5879 showed no estimates for capital expenditure by BNOC, sincethe Petroleum &amp; Submarine Pipelines Bill had not been introduced and planning for BNOCs activities was at a very early stage. Information and policy decisions on which to base estimates for BNOC in the later years of the Survey period(i.e. from 1977-78 onwards) are not available, and provision for these years willbe a charge on the contingency reserve.13. Toe BNOC was established on 1st January 1976, and on that dateacquired the shareholding in NCB (Exploration) Limited. That Company&apos;songoing exploration and development expenditure for the whole of the current financial year are included in the total for 1975-76, together with an estimate ofthe cost of BNOCs possible acquisition of the North Sea interests of theBurmah Oil Company, and of the ongoing expenditure on their further development.14. The estimates for 1976-77 cover the cost of continuing exploration anddevelopment work by NCB (Exploration) Limited, and commitments to thedevelopment of the North Sea fields which may be acquired from Burmah.15. It is difficult to estimate BNOCs capital requirements under partici-pation agreements in relation to existing and future licenses or on other activities whether in its own right or in joint operations. But some provision has been made for participation in 1976-77, and anything be-yomj this will represent a claim on contingency reserve.fitted16. The British Steel Corporation^ (BSC) capital investment programme for 1975-76 to 1979-80 represents the middle phase of the 10 year DevelopmentStrategy announced in February 1973 (Cmnd 5226).17. The two reports so far made by the Government on its review of pro-posed BSC closures have modified certain details of the Development Strategy but have not altered the broad outlines. Decisions have now been announced onmost of the proposed closures, though some significant issues are still beingconsidered.
18. The major programme of capacity modernisation and expansion onwhich the BSC is now engaged is aimed at improving the international com-petitiveness of the UK steel industry. Among the key developments in theperiod 1975-76 to 1979-80 will be the completion of the major scheme to expandsteelmaking at Ravenscraig and of the first phases of new construction atRedcar (for ironmaking). Some modernisation is already in hand at Port Talbot;the full extent of new investment there is still under consideration. Developmentsat Scunthorpe, where the Anchor project is now complete, will provide for anincrease in bloom and billet production, while other schemes will expandproduction of tinplate (at Ebbw Vale) and stainless steel flat products (in theSheffield area). Further investment to take place in Scotland in addition to current developments at Ravenscraig, totalling over  100 million, was confirmed in the closures review statement on 6 August 1975, including an expansion ofelectric arc steelmaking capacity. Part of this new capacity will be sited atHunterston, alongside the ore terminal and the direct reduction plant. these and other developments are expected to bring the bsc&apos;s total annual steal-making capacity to just over 30 million tonnes by the end of the decade.19. A reduction of  30 million was made in the bsc&apos;s forecast of capitalexpenditure for 1976-77 as a result of the measures announced in the April 1975Budget statement, giving the present forecast of  501 million for that year.20. In the four years 1975-76 to 1978-79 total expenditure on the programme is expected to be some 6 per cent higher than was forecast in Cmnd 5879. this increase results mainly from a more detailed appraisal of individual investmentschemes and of estimated plant costs. The expenditure levels forecast for1975-76 and 1976-77 are lower than those shown in Cmnd 5879, while the levelsfor 1977-78 and 1978-79 are higher, reflecting the bsc&apos;s reassessment of the phasing of the programme.Post Office21. The Secretary of State for Industry announced on 12 December 1975that Mr. C. F. Carter will chair a comprehensive Committee of Review of thePost Office. This Committee will examine among other things the use which thePost Office makes of its resources aada&amp;sets and will assess the policies, prospectsand social significance of the postal business, including methods of financing itas a self-supporting public service.Telecommunications22. The forecasts in Cmnd 5879 included provision for an investment programme rising from 815 million in 1975-76 to nearly  890 million in 1978-79.The present programme is at a level of  809 million from 1976-77 onwards. this reduction mainly reflects lower expectations of general economic growth; but it also takes account of the need in the early part of the period to reduce surplus capacity installed or ordered in response to inflated levels of demand resultingfrom Government price restraint policies from 1971 to 1974. The Post Office wTDkeep the programme under review in 1976 in the light of market forecasts.23. The longer term prospect is for slower growth in the basic telephonesystem from the end of the decade. But there will be a growing requirement to
: replace old equipment and to make reasonable provision for new services whichadvances in telecommunications technology will make possible.The table below gives some relevant statistics:	1970-71	1974-7S	1979-80Size of System (thousands)			16,900Working telephone connections  ......	...    9,214	12,698	Working telex connections.........	33	55	88.

This will reflect the need for the Post Office to make a very substantial contribution from its own resources to the financing of telecommunicationsinvestment the largest single nationalised industry programme.Posts.....25. The investment programme on the postal side is in line with that in cmnd 5879. About 70 per cent is on building, 20 per cent on mechanisation toreduce the postal serviced dependence on labour and the rest mainly onvehicles.1970-71 1974-75 1979-80Mail traffic (thousand million items)   ...        10-7 11 I 9-8In accordance with Government policy the Post Office will seek to achieve arevenue surplus for the postal business in 1976-77.Airways and airportsBritish Airways Board26. The capital investment programme of the British Airways Board consistsplainly of buying aircraft. European Division are continuing with the expansionof1 their Lockheed TriStar fleet: two are being delivered in 1975-76 and a furthertwo are due to be delivered in 1976-77. Six more aircraft of this type have been ordered for delivery after 197$, bringing the total to fifteen. Overseas Divisionwill be taking delivery of their eighteenth Boeing 747 in the early part of 1976-77.The following year will see the introduction of Rolls-Royce powered Boeing747s into the fleet and deliveries will commence in April 1977. The first Concordewas introduced into service in January 1976 and all five are expected to be delivered by early 1977.
27. The number of passengers carried by British Airways, after increasingsubstantially between 1970-71 and 1973-74, showed a reduction of some 7 &quot;percent in 1974-75 compared with the previous year;1970-71 1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75Million passengers............       11-7 12-2       13-3 14-4 13-3Percentage increase/decrease on previous . /year      ...............         2-6 4-2        9-0 8-4 -7-128. The figures in Table 2.5 show a substantial reduction i;i expenditure for1975-76 compared with Cmnd 5879. This follows from the general reduction incapacity needs which in turn has been brought about by the fuel crisis and lowereconomic growth throughout the world. Some expenditure has been deferred,and this accounts for an increase in expenditure in 1976-77 compared withCmnd 5879. A small reduction in expenditure is now foreseen in the two years1977-1979.-s    &apos;British Airports Authority29. The British Airports Authority (BAA) investment programme is delef-mined by the forecast growth of traffic at the Authority&apos;s airports, of whichthree are in the London area and four in Scotland. Most of the investment&apos;willbe at Heathrow and Gatwick but the present development programme providescapacity for forecast traffic only to the early or mid-1980s; it does not anticipate any of the possible longer term developments at the London airports referreditoin the Government^ &quot;Consultation Document: an Airport Strategy for GreatBritain, Part I The London Area&quot;.30. Earlier forecasts of air traffic growth have been drastically reduced as aresult of the rise in aircraft fuel prices and because of the general economicsituation. The table below sets out the assumptions (in terms of passengerthroughputs) on which the capital investment programme is based; also shownare actual figures for the previous 5 years which include Glagsow and Aberdeenairport?, although these were only taken over by the BAA in 1975.Terminal passengers (millions, to nearest half million)1970-71   1971-72   1972-73   1973-74   1974-75Actual      ...............       22-5 25 28 30      -   291975-76   1976-77   1977-78   1978-79   1979-80Estimated............... 29 29 30 33 3631. The BAA&apos;s forecast capital expenditure in the period to 1979-8&apos;r)&apos;1s 174 million, which in real terms represents a significant reduction in the fineyear forecast in Cmnd 5879. The reduction has been made possible largely bydeferring projects in line with revised traffic forecasts. But essential worlt aj,,in particular, Aberdeen airport which is handling an increasing amount of NorjjhSea oil traffic, has not been delayed. \ , tSurface Transport Industries british Railways Board ^32. Investment by the British Railways Board is to be held steady at rthe1976-77 levels, outside the areas of the passenger transport authorities.    --r
33. Table 2.5 covers all investment by the Board, including that in commuterrailways. Contributions to railway investment by Passenger Transport Exe-cutives (PTEs) and local authorities is shown in Table 2.6 and, to avoid doublecounting, a suitable deduction is made from &quot;other capital expenditure&quot; inTable 2.5. The deduction consists of;(i) contributions by PTEs included as part of &quot;Local Transport; Capital:Public Transport investment&quot; in Table 2.6:  million1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-8029-1 38-0 40-9 38 6 46 0(ii) contributions by local authorities, to British Rail:  million1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 1978-79 1979-800-7 1-9 2-7 2-6 3-234. Under financial arrangements adopted following the Railways Act 1974investment by the Board in track and signalling is treated as current expenditure.That part which is attributable to passenger services scores in Table 2.6 underCentral Government Subsidies to British Rail as well as in Table 2.5. Again toavoid double counting a corresponding deduction has been made in a separatetine at the end of Table 2.5.British Transport Docks Board35. The Board has 19 docks which handled 85 million tonnes of freight in1974. The investment figures include provision for the fish docks at Flectwood,Lowestoft, Grimsby and Hull; for development at Southampton; and for theacquisition of the Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company.British Waterways Board36. The Board are reviewing their loug term policy in consultation with theDepartment of the Environment. In the meantime provision has been made onthe same scale as in Cmnd 5879.National Freight Corporation37. The Corporation^ business forecasts have been severely affected by thecurrent recession and its investment plans have accordingly been reduced tolevels below those in Cmnd 5879.National Bus Company38. The National Bus Company&apos;s subsidiaries, with over 20,000 buses andcoaches, operated about 730 million vehicle miles in 1974. Investment levels arethose of Cmnd 5879 which were intended to enable the Company to reduce theaverage age of its vehicle fleet and to catch up with improvements to depotfacilities.Scottish Transport Group39. The established pattern of capital expenditure by the Group is expectedto continue with slightly increasing emphasis on the replacement of buses. Theother major expenditure is on the continued development of roll-on/roll-offvehicle ferries and associated terminals for snipping services to the ScottishIslands.

The Government is currently engaged in a comprehensive review oftransport policy. Its outcome may in due course require some revision of priori-ties within this programme. This area however has had to contribute to thegeneral savings.2. Between 1975-76 and 1978-79, road traffic in Great Britain (which ac-counted in 1974 for just over 91 per cent of passenger miles and for 65 percentof all freight-ton miles) is expected to increase by about 10 per cent. Nevertheless,in current circumstances it has been decided to cut back planned expenditure on roads and local transport In England, total expenditure on roads and localtransport was expected in Cmnd 5879 to grow by about 1 per cent between1975-76 and 1978-79, and is now intended to fall by 23 per cent over that period.In particular, expenditure on both road construction and road maintenance in1978-79 is to be less than 75 per cent of that planned in Cmnd 5879. To Scotlandand Wales, the reductions leave total expenditure on roads and local transport atthe same level between 1975-76 and 1978-79, although road construction intheae countries (which in Scotland contains a substantial oil-related component)rises by about 6 per cent.3. In conformity with the Governmenfs general policy on subsidies,previous estimates of support both to buses and to British Railways have alsobeen reduced.

The programme is now declining, but there is still a need to improve the general environment and make a positive contribution to economic growthby a continuing programme of improvements and additions to the national roadnetwork. Much progress has already been made. Some 1,975 miles of motorwayand other high quality roads are open to traffic. The objective remains thecompletion of some 3,100 miles of high quality roads: but this will now beachieved in the mid rather than the early 1980s. The limited resources availableremain concentrated on schemes with a high economic return or with sub-stantial environmental benefit (eg by-passes of historic towns).Current expenditure maintenance5. Reduced future expenditure on road maintenance was announced by theMinister for Transport on 24 July 1975, but care will be taken to avoid long-termdamage to the road structure. It is intended that the economies should be con-centrated on less heavily trafficked roads to minimise the consequence of reduc-tions in maintenance standards.Motorways and trunk roads: Scotland6. Tbe main objectives of the trunk road programme in Scotland aretwofold. First the improvement of the trunk roads providing access to otl-related developments, mainly in the North and North East of Scotland (in parti-cular by the reconstruction of the A9 north of Perth). Second, the improvementof the trunk roads serving the industrialised central belt, notably through the
completion of the motorway and dual carriageway network. While the improve-ment of the oil-related roads remains of first priority, the reductions in plannedexpenditure mean that development of other parts of the programme will beslowed down.Motorways and trunk roads: Wales7. The principal objectives of the Secretary of State remain unchanged.These are the improvement of east/west communications across both Northand South Wales, and of the road links between Wales and the major industrial and commercial areas of England. The westward extension of the M4 motorway a project vital to the economy of industrial South Wales remains the dominant single item in terms of public expenditure in the earlier years coveredby this White Paper.Local transport: England and WalesGENERAL8. This section brings together the transport expenditure for which localauthorities are responsible, and reflects the comprehensive approach to grant-aiding local transport expenditure through Transport Supplementary Grants.9. Each county council in England and Wales including the GLC submitsannually Transport Policies and Programmes for a five year period. On the basisof these the Secretaries of State decide for each authority the level of expenditure to accept for Transport Supplementary Grant purposes in the first year. Grantis payable on accepted expenditure in excess of a prescribed threshold level.Given the freedom for local authorities to determine priorities within the block grant, the allocation of expenditure within the Local Transport section of table 2.6 can only be indicative of the main trends expected, particularly in the later years.capitalRoads new construction and improvement10. The substantial reductions referred to above will require the authoritiesto postpone or abandon the start of many improvements and new roads.Car parks11. The Government have concluded that in current circumstances thereshould be a substantial reduction in the resources allocated to the constructionof car parks. By 1978-79 the level is only half of that proposed in Cmnd 5879.Public transport investment12. This heading includes all public transport investment by local authorities,Passenger Transport Executives and London Transport Executive. The invest-ment covers purchases of new buses and both renewals and improvements toequipment and infrastructure, such as new rolling stock; and extensions to theLondon Underground, the Tyneside Rapid Transit System, and bus lanes andbus stations. The investment by local authorities and PTEs in rail services has
been included both here and in Table 2.5 but to avoid double counting ithas been deducted from the totals in the latter Table. Certain public transport schemes being carried out by the British Railways Board for which centralgovernroentgrants continue to be paid are included in Table 2,5 without any offset,but not in Table 2.6. Reductions compared with Cmnd 5879 will leave little scope for any major new public transport infrastructure schemes.CURRENTRoads Maintenance13. As with motorway and trunk roads, substantial savings are called for inroad maintenance expenditure. These should be concentrated on least-usedroads and those where speeds are low, minimising the effect on road safety.Car Parks14. The Government consider that the revenue from car parking should besufficient to meet not only running expenses but also interest and loan repay-ments (or depreciation) on capital, so that car parking is not subsidised by therates. The figures therefore assume that the expected excess of gross incomeover running expenses will rise to approximately equal loan charges by1978-79; and gross income will in future be revalued by the rise in price ofthe gross domestic product, rather than (as hitherto) by the actual changesin car parking charges. Since no material increase in the volume of carparking can be expected, the large increase in the income required couldonly be achieved by large annual increases in charges. The effects of such increases will be kept under review.Other Expenditure15.  This is mainly expenditure by local authorities on road safety.Passenger Transport Subsidies British Rail16. Subsidies are paid by PTEs and local authorities to meet losses arisingon the local rail services which the authorities consider to be a necessary part ofthe public transport system in their areas. The provision permits a continuation,but no expansion, of the existing commitments in this field. (Central Govern-ment current subsidies direct to the British Railways Board are shown underCentral Government subsidies to nationalised industries in paragraph 21 below.)Passenger Transport Subsidies-Other17. This covers revenue subsidies paid to bus, underground and ferryservices by local authorities. As announced in Cmnd 5879, the government&apos;s policy is progressively to reduce the level of such subsidies in England andWales. In the April 1975 Budget Statement reductions in programmed expenditure-ure for 1976-77 were announced which included a further cut of  12 million inthe level of this subsidy. The Government have also decided that the originaltarget of  60.8 million by 1978-79 should be reduced to  48.5 million. For thefollowing year the figure remains the same in recognition that there is likely tobe a minimum level of subsidy which it would be impossible to reduce withoutintolerable reductions in services, [q allocating (he subsidy between authorities,in the decisions on expenditure accepted for Transport Supplementary grant for 1976-77, the Government have made a substantial shift away from holding
down fares in the major conurbations towards maintenance of levels of service in less densely populated areas. It intends to continue this shift of support infuture years.Concessionary fares18. Expenditure on concessionary fares is shown under Roads and Trans-port for the first time. Previously it was included under Health and personal social Services. Expenditure has been rising very rapidly in recent years, and inthe 1976-77 Rate Support Grant settlement provision has been made on thebasis that economies can be achieved. Authorities have been asked to examinecritically the continuation of concessions at peak periods, which generallyinvolve high resource costs. The Government have proposed a review, with localauthorities, of expenditure on these schemes. In the meantime the figuresderived from Cmnd 5879 for the years after 1976-77 have been left unchanged.Local Transport: Scotland19. Responsibility in this field lies with regional and islands councils whosubmitted the first comprehensive Transport Policies and Programmes to theSecretary of State for Scotland in the autumn of 1975. The policies and principlesexpressed in the foregoing paragraphs will in general apply in a like manner to scotland. The figures for local transport capital expenditure in Scotland are sufficient for the significant level of oil-related roadworks by Scottish localauthorities and for continuation of the major roads and transport projects under construction, most notably the modernisation of the Glasgow Underground andthe revival of the Central Low Level Line in Glasgow. The reduced provision will however reinforce the emphasis which regional and island councils arealready giving to projects which secure the best use of the present transportassets rather than those designed to extend transport networks.20. On revenue expenditure, while decisions will be for regional and islandscouncils to take in the light of their assessment of priorities, it is expected that a significant reduction will be required in road maintenance and associatedexpenditure over the next few years. The figures assume that the general level oflocal authority revenue support for public transport services including expenditure-ure on concessionary fares will stay about the same in real terms. It may, how-ever, be expected that there will be a continuation of the existing trend away from general support (designed to keep fares down) towards specific support inparticular cases; and towards the maintenance of an essential network of services, especially in rural areas.Central Government SubsidiesNationalised Industries21. The largest item in this block provides support to the passenger servicesof the British Railways Board. This support is to enable the Board to meet thepublic service obligation laid on it by the Government under the Railways Act1974. A rising level of support was assumed in Cmnd 5879. But consistent withthe target which the Secretary of State has set the Board for 1976 of containingtheir passenger grant requirement within its 1975 level m real terms it is now
assumed that the grant will not be increased in real terms in subsequent years.Total subsidies, including indicative sums for payments by the PTEs which areincluded in local transport in paragraph 14 above, are estimated to be   million1975-76    1976-77    1977-78    1978-79    1979-80Central Government support...... 258-3       257-6       256-9       256-9       256-9PTE support in England     ......   16-9 177        18-4 18-4 18-scotland     ......    68 6-8 6-8 6-8 6-8Total      ............ 282-0       2821       2821       2821       282-122. Grant was also paid to the British Railways Board in 1975 in respect oftheir freight business, as the Minister for Transport announced in parliament on 24 July 1975. At the end of the year it was expected that this grant would continue to be needed for a period, though on a diminishing scale. pending further decisions however no provision is made for the continuation of thegrant after 1975. Temporary support may also be needed for the rail basedcompanies of the National Freight Corporation.23.  Two other industries require support in 1975-76 and subsequently: (a) The British Waterways Board receives grants in respect of essenlia&apos;maintenance of its waterways and the improvement to modern trafficstandards of about 400 bridges carrying public roads over the water-ways. Provision is made for maintenance to continue at 1975 levels in real terms, pending the outcome of a joint review of long term policy which the Board are conducting with the Department of the environment.(b) The provision covers grants to the Scottish Transport Group for losse8on those Western islands Shipping Services which are operated by its subsidiaries, Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd and David MacBrayneLtd.Other24. The main item is a refund of fuel duty (22 p per gallon) to operators of bus stage services in respect of about 1,500 million miles of stage carriageservices run each year. In addition 50 per cent grants towards the cost of buying new buses for use on stage services are being paid. Cash control of thesegrants, as on other expenditure, is being introduced from 1 April 1976; however,the provision allows for about the same level of support in real terms in 1976-77as in previous years. Total investment in new buses by the local authoritysector appears under local transport in Table 2.6 and similar investment bynationalised industries is in Table 2.5. In order to avoid double counting,provision is made here for grants to the private sector only.25. The Railways Act 1974 empowered the Secretary of State to makegrant towards the provision of facilities for the loading or unloading of railfreight. Applications have been few in the first year, but are expected to increase.Table 2.6 covers the payment of grant to the private sector. Grant aidedexpenditure by public sector bodies will form part of their capital progranimes.26. Other subsidies include those under the Highlands and Islands shipping services Act 1960, and the sea transport services to Orkney and Shetlands.
Ports and shippingPorts27. This item covers investment by the independent Harbour Trusts andlocal authority owned harbours, and grants and loans to ports in the private sector. (Investment by the British Transport Docks Board is dealt with in chapter 2.5, paragraph 35) The figures reflect some reduction in investmentfrom 1976-77 onwards compared with Cmnd 5879. Provision for the new portat SuIIom Voe in the Shetland Islands, to deal with North Sea oil, has alsobeen slightly reduced in the early years to reflect rephasing of constructionwork. It is not possible at this stage to include estimates of the cost of theGovernment&apos;s proposals for public ownership of ports and ports businesses,or the years in which this expenditure will arise.Skipping services28. The main objective of expenditure on these services is the maintenance and improvement of safety around the coasts and at sea. It covers the Coast-guard, including expenditure arising from the first stage of plans for there organisation of the service; surveys of ships; examinations of seamen; andother services including navigational broadcasts, the operation of a trawlersupport ship, and the monitoring of shipping in the English Channel. provision is also made for measures to combat offshore oil pollution and for the UKsubscription to the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation.Civil aviation services29. A grant in aid is paid to the Civil Aviation Authority to cover its deficit on revenue account; it is intended that this deficit should eventually be eliminated. The programme also covers capital expenditure by the CivilAviation Authority (mainly on equipment and installations for the NationalAir Traffic Services) and by local authorities on aerodromes. It also coversmiscellaneous items including the UK&apos;s subscriptions to euro control and tothe International Civil Aviation Organisation, and expenditure on aviationsecurity.30. After a number of years of steady expansion the number of aircraftmovements handled by the National Air Traffic Services levelled off during1974 as shown below: 1970 1971 1972 1973 19741,142,796 1,217,406 1,258,031 1.345,243 1.358,559However, the proportion of high speed and wide-bodied aircraft used by the airlines continues to increase and the Civil Aviation Authority is continuingits re-equipment programme designed to modernise and improve UK air traffic control facilities.Other transport services31. As well as expenditure on central Government administration and receipts from fees for driving and vehicle tests, provision is made for certain minor items.
CHANGES IN PROGRAMMED EXPENDITURE32. The reductions discussed in Part I of this White Paper amount to about 500 million in 1978-79 in the roads and transport programme, comparedwith Cmnd 5879. The major components of that total are: (a) about  200 million reduction in road construction;(b) about  100 million reduction in road maintenance (including the cuts announced by the Minister for Transport on 24 July 1975); and(c) about  100 million reduction in Central Government support for nilpassenger services: that support, consistently with the statement bythe Secretary of State on 30 June 1975, has now been retained at the1975 level throughout the period.

The planned levels of expenditure for future years reflect the continuinghigh priority being accorded to housing. The annual totals incorporate bothrevised estimates of the cost of certain items and a modest reduction in theCmnd 5879 projections, made to contribute to the general need for public expenditure savings, notably in 1978-79. They do not therefore reflect the growthprojected in Cmnd 5879 and are lower by  175 million in 1976-77,  284 million in 1977-78 and  365 million in 1978-79. Throughout the period however theyremain at tbe much increased level to which they were raised after the Govern-ment took office in March 1974, The policies reflected in these estimates will besubject to reconsideration when the outcome of the Government^ currentReview of Housing Finance is known.Subsidies2. The estimates of subsidies are in general lower than those in Cmnd 5879.In 1976-77 extra provision has been made for a special subsidy to enable public sector rent increases to be kept to an average of 60p a dwelling, in accordancewith the White Paper &quot;The Attack on Inflation&quot; (Cmnd 6151). In this year the percentage of costs borne by rents, after rebates, will stay at about 43 percent. Thereafter it is assumed that the percentage will rise so as to exceed 50per cent by the end of the period so enabling savings of about  180 million ayear to be made by 1978-79. Together with revised estimates of the underlyingcosts of housing subsidies, the total resultant reduction in that year&apos;s  3J0 million.But rents will still be meeting a smaller proportion of costs than in early yearsof the decade.

The option mortgage scheme is designed to give house purchasers of moderate income benefits roughly equal to those available through tax relief on mortgage interest to basic rate payers. The forecast reflects the increases insubsidy necessary following the change in the basic rate of income tax. It is increased by amounts rising to  26 million in 1978-79.Grant and loans to bousing associations4. Provision is made for continued support to housing associations by theHousing Corporation and by local authorities. This provision would allowgrant approvals to be given to housing association projects involving on averageabout 46,000 new or improved dwellings a year. This programme is in totalsimilar to that envisaged in Cmnd 5879, but it will be necessary to achieve agreater direction of resources to the areas of greatest need.Improvements and renovation5. The estimates for grants to the private sector while higher than the out-turn expected for 1975-76 have been reduced from those in Cmnd 5879 to reflect the lower volume of applications now being made. The reduction reaches  40million in 1978-79. There is an increase in the figure for local authority im-provement in England in 1976-77. This reflects a reallocation of provision from local authority lending for house purchase (see paragraph 8) to improvement and to acquisitions of older housing (see paragraph 7) for that year. This
reallocation is a repetition of that made in 1975-76 in order to further the government&apos;s social and housing objectives and in the light of the first results ofa more detailed assessment of needs. Different circumstances obtain in Scotlandand Wales, where it is not intended to make similar changes in the balance ofthese programmes.Table AImprovement grants approved: Great Britain	For local authorities	For housing associations	For private owners	Number of dwellings1970    ......... 1971     ......... 1972     ......... 1973     ......... 1974    .........	......      59,500 ......      89,000 ......     132,800 ......     188,100 ......     121,400	4,100 6,200 6,800 5,100 5,300	116,400 137,400 224,500 260,400 173,800	180,000 232,500 368,100 453,500 300,500Investment				6. The figures of approvals for new housebuilding by local authorities, new towns and the Scottish Special Housing Association in Table B show that the revival of public sector housebuilding which began in 1974 as a result of initiativestaken by the Government has continued in 1975, for which the provisionalfigure is higher than at any time in the last five years. The increased provisioncompared with Cmnd 5879 for gross investment in 1978-79 reflects this. taken together with new building for rent by housing associations (about 25,000 ayear), the present level for new building in the publicly financed rented sectoris higher than at any time in the last five years.Table BPermanent dwellings approved: local authorities, new towns and the scottish special Housing Association: Great BritainNumber1970 ........................     119,9001971 ........................     118,2001972 ........................     105,5001973 ........................     102,900J974 ........................     132,000 (excludingacquisitions fromdevelopers)1975 provisional    ..................     144,0007. Gross investment also includes provision for a continuing programme of acquisition of existing dwellings by local authorities. Capital receipts from thedisposal of land and buildings are currently lower than had previously been estimated but the overall figures for net investment reflect an increase in later years in the expectation that some authorities will adopt building for sale as partof their programmes. The reduced level of gross investment in 1976-77 ascompared with 1975-76 reflects the bunching of expenditure in the earlier yearsdue to a faster rate of completions together with some residual expenditure from the 1974 programme of acquisitions from developers.Lending8. Local authorities lending consists mainly of loans to individuals for house purchase. Lending for this purpose rose to an unexpectedly high level in 1974-75,
and subsequently the Government decided to introduce quantitative controls.These were related in England in 1975-76 and 1976-77 to lower totals than those provided in 1974-75, in order to release more resources for local authorityimprovement (see paragraph 5) and acquisitions (see paragraph 7) arid in thelight of the commitment of the building societies to the principle of giving helpwherever possible so that the limited funds available for lending by localauthorities may be used to the best advantage. Controls were also introduced in 1975-76 in Wales where the provision is lower to offset increases elsewhere,and in Scotland where the provision for later years is unchanged from Cmnd5879. Local authorities will in future be acting as lenders of the last resort andtheir individual allocations for 1976-77 are designed to concentrate their lendingin areas of greatest need and to assist in preserving the stock of older houses.The provision for 1976-77 is also reduced by  52 million as part of the reductionsannounced in the statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the budget ofApril 1975, and a similar reduction is applied in later years.Table CLocal authorities loans to private persons for house purchase: England and WalesNew Other                   Alldwellings dwellings dwellings(970    ............          2,600 41,500 44,1001971     ............          2,700 44,500 47,2001972    ...........          1.900 43.300 45,2001973     ............          2,700 56,700 59,4001974    ............          4,600 70,800 75.400Table DStock of dwellings: by tenure 1966 to 1974: Great BritainRented from localauthorities or newtown corporationsPercentageApril 1966*end 1968end 1970April 1971 *end 1972end 1973end   1974Thousand4,9573,3875,6985,7335,8655,9206,055of total28-429-530-430-430-530-530-9Thousand8,1468.8989,3569,4279,87710,13310,309Owner occupiedPercentageof total46-648-850-050151-452-252-5April 1966*end 1968end 1970April 1971*end 1972end 1973end   1974Rented from private owners and other tenuresPercentageThousand4,3653,9493.6773,6733,4703,3613,261of total25021-719-619 518-117-316-6TotalStock17,46818,23418,73118,83319,21219,41419,625TotalHouseholds17,57017,81018.16018,23018,58018,75018,900* derives from census.
CHANGES IN PROGRAMMED expenditure.  The main changes from Cmnd 5879 are as follows: (a) Subsidies. The amounts provided for subsidies are reduced by  135million in 1976-77,  220 million in 1977-78 and  310 million in 1978-79.(b) Improvement. Improvement grants estimates have been reduced from the levels foreseen in Cmnd 5879 by about  40 million in1978-79. Improvement investment provision is higher in England in1976-77 by  90 million, including  10 million (out of a total of  16million) to counter unemployment in the construction industry.(c) Gross investment provision has been increased by amounts rising to 60 million in 1978-79. But this is offset by higher expected levels ofcapital receipts.(d) Local authority lending for house purchase in 1976-77 in England is reduced to about two-thirds of the level foreseen in Cmnd 5879t(e) Provision for option mortgage subsidy is increased by varying amountsrising to  26 million in 1978-79.

Responsibility for water services in England and Wales lies with nineRegional Water Authorities and the Welsh National Water DevelopmentAulhority. These services consist mainly of water supply and conservation,sewerage and sewage disposal, land drainage, prevention of water pollution,fisheries and amenity and recreation associated with water. The programmealso covers the Thames Tidal Flood Protection Scheme which is the responsi-bility of the Water Authorities concerned and the GLC. The Authorities were set up under the Water Act 1973 to manage these services as a whole. their capital expenditure is shown as aggregates in Table 2.8; their current ex-penditure is met from charges and does not form part of public expenditure.In Scotland water services are the responsibility of regional and island councils,2. Capital expenditure by the Water Authorities is controlled by the al-location of capital ceilings to each Authority. Departments are consultingAuthorities on the form of full medium-term plans which the Authorities willbe required to submit annually in support of their capital investment proposals in the development of effective corporate planning.3. The 1976-77 capital programmes of Water Authorities and scottish local authorities set out in Cmnd 5879 were reduced by 10 per cent in April1975, and larger reductions have since been made for subsequent years. Althoughthe average rate of growth in expenditure on water services assumed in Cmnd5879 will not now be possible, the level programme now assumed should enablethe Governmenfs priorities for provision of services to meet urgent publichealth needs, new housing and industrial development to be generally realised;although it is recognised that the Authorities&apos; ability to commission new works will be severely restricted during the period of this review.

This group of mainly local authority services includes refuse collection and disposal, smoke control, public conveniences and other public healthexpenditure, the reclamation of derelict land, the provision of parks and recre-ational facilities, the provision of municipal buildings and administrative services, and activities carried out under the Town and Country Planning Acts aswell as a number of minor services such as private street works, coast protection,civic theatres and restaurants, retail markets, cemeteries and crematoria.CAPITAL5. Most of the services in this group in England and Wales come within thelocally determined sector arrangements for controlling capital expenditure.In this sectoran annual block borrowing consent is notified to local authorities.They are free to spend at their own discretion up to this amount, plus what theychoose to meet from revenue or capital receipts. The locally determined sectorcovers a wide variety of projects, including some which fall in other programmes(See Table 3.4). It is not possible to forecast with any accuracy how much willbe spent on particular services. The derelict land reclamation programme andthe coast protection programme are controlled by separate key sector borrowingapproval. In Scotland local authority capital expenditure is subject to specificapproval.6. The provision for other environmental services as a whole for 1976-77onwards has been substantially reduced betow the level in Cmnd 5879. these reductions are reflected in the total annual borrowing limits notified to localauthorities who will have tp reduce their capital programmes with an inevitable
postponement of desirable schemes. In 1976-77 they will have to devote theirborrowing allocation almost entirely to projects which are already committedunder contract or are otherwise essential.7. For the last four years local authorities in England and Wales havechosen to spend more heavily on sport and recreational projects at the expenseof planning and other services in the locally determined sector. However, withthe heavy demand for office accommodation to fit the reorganised local authoritystructure and the need to extend and improve facilities for collection and disposal of refuse it is likely, having regard also to the more limited resources available in the next few years, that this pattern of expenditure will change. . The derelict land grants in the assisted areas and the derelict land clear-ance areas of England were increased to 100 per cent from 15 December 1975in order to encourage local authorities to give higher priority to areas of dere-liction. The new rate matches the arrangements in Scotland and Wales wherethe new Development Agencies will meet the full costs of schemes. It should bring about a similar rate of clearance as is planned in Scotland and Wales.9. Part of the measures aimed at the alleviation of unemployment introduced during 1975 falls within Other Environmental Services in England: this willalso be controlled by separate key sector loan approvals.current10. The figures for local authority current expenditure in 1976-77 are basedon the forecasts arrived at after consultation with the local authority associated -ations in the course of the recent rate support grant negotiations. These areconducted separately for England and Wales and for Scotland.England and Wales11. In the context of an overall standstill in local authority current ex-penditure the figures for these environmental services show a reduction inspending in real terms of some 6.5 per cent from the estimated outturn for1975-76. The figures for 1976-77 assume in particular that local authorities will pay close attention to their charging policies, not allowing services which ought to be self-financing to run at a loss. Use of manpower will need to be as effective and economical as possible with administrative costs being kept to aminimum. The figures for subsequent years assume further reductions in realexpenditure on these services. The steps necessary to achieve these reductionswill be the subject of discussions with the local authority associations under the aegis of the Consultative Council on Local Government Finance. The figures include  1 million to enable local authorities to implement sections 3-11 of theControl of Pollution Act 1974. A compensating reduction has been made toother Central Government programmes.Scotland12. The provision for 1976-77 is below the level of expenditure which hadbeen planned by local authorities and they have been asked to take steps to restrict their expenditure. It will be necessary for this effort to continue through-out the period; and if particular increases in expenditure are unavoidable itwill be necessary for these to be offset by reductions in other expenditures.
Community Ownership of Development Land13. This is a new key sector item providing for the capitalisad purchase,administrative and interest costs of local authorities and the Land Authorityfor Wales of buying and making available land for private development in their areas. The amounts shown are broad estimates of likely net expenditureafter offsetting receipts assuming acquisitions and disposals of land in GreatBritain at the following levels:-AcquitilionsSate1976-77       1977-78       1978-79       1979-801,300 3.900 7,700 12,300- 400 2.400 5,500The programme will be controlled initially by separate borrowing approvalsand subsequently on the basis of annual allocations of borrowing approval.Royal palaces and royal parks14. Expenditure on this item covers maintenance etc. of the royal palacesand royal parks throughout the United Kingdom. There will be a reduction inthe figures for the later years compared with Cmnd 5879. Expenditure is being restricted to maintain the same level of work as in 1976-77.Historic buildings and ancient monuments15. This item covers grants for the repair of historic buildings, other related services, and expenditure on the purchase, maintenance, repair and display ofancient monuments, also emergency excavations for recording monumentsbefore sites are developed. More detailed information of the work in this fieldis available in the Annual Reports of the Historic Buildings Councils and theAncient Monuments Boards for England, Scotland and Wales, and in theDepartment of the Environments annual publication: &quot;Archaeological Exca-vations&quot;. There is a reduction in the figures for the later years compared withCmnd 5879, expenditure being restricted to maintain the same level of work asin 1976-77.Environmental research16. This item covers expenditure by the Department of the Environmentat its three research stations (the Transport and Road Research Laboratory,the Building Research Establishment and the Hydraulics Research Station), the extra-mural research programme and grants to research associations and other bodies. The figures are substantially less than those contained in Cmnd 5879and reflect a significant reduction in the Departments research programme inthe years 1976-77 to 1979-80. There will be a cut back of planned increases inthe number of research staff and savings in the Departments external researchprogrammes.
CHANGES IN PROGRAMMED EXPENDITURE17. Apart from the Community Land scheme figures, the main changes inthe forecasts of expenditure since Cmnd 5879 arise from the continuing need to reduce the growth of public expenditure.

1. Table 2.9 includes expenditure on: the administration of justice; thetreatment of offenders including the detention of persons remanded in custodyand of offenders serving sentences, the provision of after-care for releasedoffenders and the various non-custodial penalties available to the courts;services concerned with the protection of people and property-namely thepolice and fire services; civil defence; the control of immigration; the develop-ment of good community relations, including provision for the Urban Pro-gramme and grants towards certain voluntary services. The greater part of theexpenditure is incurred initially by local authorities on services to which theGovernment contributes by way of specific grants and rate support grant.Administration of justiceCOURT SERVICES: - ENGLAND AND WALESMagistrates&apos; Courts and Coroners&apos; Courts2. Local authority expenditure on day-to-day running costs of magistrates&apos;courts and coroners&apos; courts is estimated to rise from  33.4 million in 1975-76 to 37 million in 1979-80. The capital expenditure will cover the completion ofnew courthouses already under construction and a small programme of new works in 1976-77 but will not permit any new work in the later years of theperiod.3. Provision for payment of costs awarded in magistrates&apos; courts and theCrown Courts is estimated to show a slight rise, in line with a probable rise inthe number of cases.Higher Courts4. Table A on page 86 shows the pattern of expenditure on the highercourts based on forecasts of criminal and civil business. Gross current expenditure of the courts depends mainly on the number of cases with whichthey have to deal. In the case of civil business, this is largely offset by courtfees. The figures reflect an intention to reduce net expenditure over theyears concerned, primarily by adjustments in the fee structure.5. The Courts Act 1971 enabled accommodation formerly used by Assizesand Quarter Sessions to be retained until 1981 for the use of the higher courts,while replacement courts are being built. Successive cuts in the level of ex-penditure in recent years have meant that some of these courts cannot now be built in time. Legislation to extend the period during which the higher courtscontinue to occupy the present accommodation may therefore prove necessary.COURT SERVICES:  SCOTLAND6. Capital expenditure on sheriff court buildings rises from rather under 1 million in 1975-76 to just over  3 million in 1979-80. Even this increase in expenditure will not avoid the deferment of many urgently required improve-ments to existing buildings until the early 1980&apos;s.7. An increase in current expenditure for increasing court business, theintroduction of Summary Cause (a new procedure for dealing with smallclaims) and the implementation of security arrangements, is offset by increases in court fees.
Criminal Injuries Compensation8. Payments by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board are expected tocontinue to rise in response to a steady increase in the number of applicants.More detailed information is contained in the Eleventh Report of the BoardCmnd 6291).Legal Aid9. The object of the expenditure is to make legal aid, advice and assistanceavailable to persons of limited means. The scope of the schemes is fixed by statute, so that the level of expenditure depends on the number of eligibleapplicants.10. Expenditure on civil legal aid is expected to rise from  20.6 million in1975-76 to  22.4 million in 1976-77. Thereafter, by some adjustments in thescope of the legal aid scheme and by administrative and other economies, it isestimated that expenditure will remain reasonably level. Expenditure on legal advice and assistance is expected to rise by about 10 per cent a year over the5 year period.11. Expenditure on criminal legal aid is expected to rise by about 9 per cent a year in the magistrates&apos; courts and 7 per cent in the higher courts in line withthe expected rise in proceedings.Treatment of offendersPrisons12. The main assumption is that the total number of persons held in custodywill rise from 45,200 in 1975-76 to 47,900 by 1979-80, despite increasing use ofnon-custodial treatment.13. The programme provides for an increase in non-industrial staff over theperiod from 20,000 to 24,300. Provision is made for the continued use of pro-nation  officers and supporting staff for welfare work in prisons and trainingborstals in England and Wales. About 420 probation officers are expected to beso employed in 1975-76, rising to 470 in 1979-80. A gradual increase is alsoexpected in the numbers of local authority social workers employed in prisonsin Scotland.14. The capital programme has again been reviewed in the light of the expected size of the prison population and of the resources which can be madeavailable. It is intended to complete building schemes which have alreadycommenced and to start one of the major projects previously planned. this programme is expected to produce about 6,250 places during the period,reducing significantly the shortfall of places against expected inmate population,and to provide about 2,850 staff quarters, including those at new establishments.No provision is now made for new schemes to replace or rebuild entirely olderprisons or hutted camps.15 Expenditure at existing establishments on staff quarters and on schemes to ensure that places can be fully used and acceptable standards maintained isexpected to average about  13.5 million a year.
Probation and After-Care16. The forecast assumes a lower rate of increase in staff and hostel placesthan was envisaged in Cmnd 5879. The number of probation officers (excludingofficers seconded to prison department establishments) is expected to rise from,500 to 5,340 over the period. Provision is made for the extension of com-munity service schemes and for an expansion of the day training centres scheme.The programme also provides for an additional 1,200 places in adult probationand bail hostels, beyond the 400 places available. It is expected that voluntary organisations will provide only a modest increase in after-care hostel places in 1976-77, but a greater increase in later years.17. In Scotland, probation and after-care are provided for in the health and Personal Social Services Programme.General protective servicesPoliceIS. Provision is made for tbe continuing build-up of police strengthstowards authorised establishments and for essential support services. Over thepast year recruitment of police officers has improved considerably and it is now expected that their numbers will rise from 114,700 to 124,800 over the period,though even with these increases police strength will in some areas remainbelow authorised establishment. Should numbers exceed the estimated growth,provision will be made for additional expenditure within authorised establish-ments.19. The number of civilians, including traffic wardens and cadets, employed for police purposes rose sharply from April to September 1975, when it stood at 50,900. This figure will however be reduced to 50,000 over the period, a lower level than assumed in Cmnd 5879.20. Compared with previous forecasts, the estimates for capital expenditureon sites and operational buildings have been reduced by spreading forward thebuilding programme over a longer period, but starts will be made on someheadquarters and other operational buildings. Provision is made for buildingtwo new enlarged forensic science laboratories to replace four existing ones, andon a reduced scale for some redevelopment of police training centres. the planned expansion of the Police College will be completed.Fire Services21. The forecasts assume that the numbers of whole-time firemen, ofpart-time and junior firemen and of civilian staff will remain constant at about36,300, 16,200 and 5,700 respectively over the period, rather higher in totalthan assumed in Cmnd 5879. The cost will nevertheless rise slightly, mainly because of increased superannuation payments.22. In 1977-78 and succeeding years there will be reductions in expenditureon fire research and on the Fire Service Staff and Technical Colleges.23. The capital expenditure figures allow for a very limited, and sharplydeclining, building programme, with expenditure falling from  20.1 million in1975-76 to  6 million in 1979-80.
Other24. The programme covers the cost of immigration controls, the immi-gration appeal system and naturalisation service, and a grant in aid to theUnited Kingdom Immigrants Advisory Service. The increase over the periodreflects a continuing growth in work loads.Community services25. The increase over the period in the programme as a whole has beenreduced to about 4 per cent. Within this, provision is included for the urban programme, grants to voluntary bodies and the new Equal OpportunitiesCommission, and for replacing the separate Race Relations Board and Com-munity Relations Commission by the new Race Relations Commission.Other information26. Table B on page 87 provides a simple framework within which theallocation of resources to the prison service may be related to the planneduse of these resources and their projected outputs. Other information ofa non-financial character is published in the annual reports of the workof the Prison Services and Parole Boards, reports on the work of the probation and After-care Service and the annual reports of HM ChiefInspectors of the Police and Fire Services.CHANGES IN PROGRAMMED EXPENDITURE27. As a result of the review, parts of this programme have been reducedcompared with Cmnd 5879. The main reductions fall on the building pro-grammes for prisons, police, fire services and the courts, but provision con-tinues to be made for improved recruitment to the police and for maintainingfire service manpower.

Education and librariesGeneral1. Expenditure on education and libraries is expected to total  5,872million in 1975-76, and is planned to increase to  5,931 million in 1976-77,subsequently declining to  5,703 million by 1979-80 as the total number of school pupils and the growth in the demand for higher education decline.2. The year-by-year pattern of expenditure is based on the pupil and studentnumbers set out in the following table.Schools^Under fivesi.........Primary pupils      ......Secondary pupils to age 16...Over 16      .........Non-advanced further education^Higher education4     ......(1) Estimates for January in the relevant year.(?) The figures, which cover nursery pupils and pupils in primary schools, take account of the proportionate demand on facilities of part-time pupils and are expressed as full-time equivalents.(?) The figures are estimated for the academic year beginning in the relevant financial year andare expressed as full-time equivalents of students undertaking non-advanced level work atestablishments of further education, including evening institutes (as in Cmnd 5879).(4) The figures are estimated for the academic year beginning in the relevant financial year.They take into account full-time and sandwich students undertaking advanced level work at universities (throughout Great Britain) and polytechnics and other establishments of further education. Part-time students in advanced further education (included in Cmnd 5879) havebeen excluded.			Thousands	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80418	459	459	459	4595,363	5,274	5,141	4,974	4,7853,746	3,813	3,849	3,846	3,814549	581	607	630	654721	743	765	788	809511	516	523	533	5343. The planned expenditure figures reflect not only the restraints necessaryin view of the economic situation but also changes in the prospective demandfor education at a number of levels, compared with the projections embodied in Cmnd 5879. Latest projected numbers of births show a further fall andsomewhat lower growth rates are also expected, on the basis of observedtrends, in the number of pupils remaining at school beyond the statutoryschool leaving age and in the demand for higher education. On the other hand,increased demand for non-advanced further education is also taken into account.4. The current expenditure forecast for 1976-77 in Table 2.10 embodies therecent rate support grant settlements. The implications of these settlementsfor the education service are set out in circulars to local authorities (DESCircular 15/75 and Scottish Office Finance Circular 75/1975). Provision for later years is intended in general to meet educational demand as now foreseen, but most previously planned improvements in standards must now be postponed. Inthe post-school sector further growth in student numbers will mostly have to be accomodated through economies in operating standards.Schools5. The forecasts of expenditure provide for no change in the number of under-fives in school after 1976-77. But, with declining 3 and 4 year old age groups, the proportion of children receiving nursery education will continue toincrease steadily. By 1980 places will be available for more than four-fifths of the policy target set in the 1972 White Paper &quot;Education: A Framework for
Expansion&quot; (Cmnd 5174). In Scotland it is expected that the estimate given in cmnd 5175-40 per cent of the 3 and 4 year old age group in education by1977-will be achieved. The reduced capital expenditure provision for under-fives should still ensure acceptable standards of accommodation in areas ofgreatest need.6. The total school population will fall after 1976-77, but provision willcontinue to be made for extra school places required for local increases in numbers as a result of the movement of population. There will also be modestscope for the improvement of old schools and, on a reduced scale, for the building of special schools. The capital expenditure figures in England and Wales include provision for the special allocation of building starts in 1976-77 to assist there organisation of secondary education on comprehensive lines, which was announced on 6 August 1975.7. In England and Wales provision has been made for staffing at the re-spective standards which have been achieved nationally this year, and for thephased introduction of induction training for newly trained teachers and theexpansion of in-service training to be deferred until 1977-78. On this basis the teaching force is expected to rise to 464,000 in 1977-78 and 1978-79. The size of the teaching force thereafter, as the total number of school pupils declines,must be further considered. In Scotland the programme provides for the main-tenance throughout the period of the current standards, as agreed with theConvention of Scottish Local Authorities and promulgated in Scottish OfficeFinance Circular No. 64/1975.Higher Education8. The projections of expenditure in Table 2.10 will allow for a progressiveexpansion in student numbers to a figure of 600,000 full-time and sandwichcourse students in Great Britain by 1981. Though a number of factors make foruncertainty in forecasting the corresponding demand, this implies some increasein competition for entry in some subjects compared with recent years, but will allow for a further rise in the proportion of the post-school age group enteringhigher education, at present about 14 per cent, to about 15 per cent. The plannedlevel of current expenditure will require a progressively more effective use of resources. In particular, there will be little if any scope for increasing total staff numbers after 1976-77. Capital expenditure on new buildings, including newpurpose-built student residences, will continue to be severely restricted and more intensive use of available premises will accordingly be required.9. Although demand for non-advanced further education tends to fluctuateconsiderably, and is thus particularly difficult to estimate, the projections onwhich provision for capital and current expenditure is based reflect the fact that demand is growing more rapidly than was expected in Cmnd 5879 and assume that local authorities will seek to meet that demand, particularly in relation tothe 16-19 age groups to which the Government attach priority. As in higher education, however, more intensive use of buildings and staff will be required.School Meals10. In accordance with the Governments general policy or directingassistance more selectively to those most in need, the forecasts of expenditure
are based on the assumption that the charge for the school dinner will beincreased progressively, commencing with an increase from 15p to 20p inSeptember 1976; there will be the usual arrangements for remitting the chargein cases of hardship. The present average subsidy of over 60 per cent will bereduced by 1980 by about half.Research Councils Etc.11. The forecasts for Research Councils, etc., represent expenditure col-lectively known as the Science Budget, for which the Secretary of State for education and Science is responsible. It relates to expenditure by the fiveResearch Councils (Agricultural, Medical, Natural Environment, Science and social Science), the British Museum (Natural History) and a grant-in-aid to theRoyal Society for scientific purposes. The Secretary of State is advised on itsallocation by the Advisory Board for the Research Councils. The science budget was allocated in 1975-76 Estimates as follows:  millionAgricultural Reserach Council (ARC)..................... 13 1Medical Research Council (MRC)     .....-      ............... f&quot;&quot;*Natural Environment Research Council (NERO   ...............Science Research Council (SRC)       ..     ..................Social Science Research Council (SSRQ     .................. 8 7Natural History Museum&apos;      ........................ f *royal society    .............................. jj^Total 170&quot;** Include provision for major building.12. The purpose of the research financed from the Science Budget is todevelop the sciences as such, to maintain a fundamental capacity for research and to support higher education. It covers a wide spectrum of activity, ranging from investigation of human and animal health and behaviour through the causes of, and cures for pollution, to the mapping of the earth, sea and sky andthe investigation of the laws of physical matter. In addition to research financed from the Science Budget, the Research Councils carry out research commis-sioned by government departments. The value of this research in 1975-76 was 32 million. This sum has been progressively transferred from the science budget to the votes of the government departments concerned over the threeyears 1973-74 to 1975-76 under the arrangements for commissioning applied research introduced by the 1972 White Paper &quot;Framework for government research and Development&quot; (Cmnd 5046).13. Compared with earlier White Papers the projected level of the science budget shown in Table 210 shows a different pattern of growth. After an initial increase it will decline to the level of expenditure in the current year,ft is intended, following the advice of the Advisory Board for the research councils, to reduce expenditure in the areas of &quot;big science&quot; (high energyphysics, astronomy, and space science) supported by the Science research council, in order to sustain the other sciences (including applied science)supported by that Council, and to enable the Agricultural, Medical, NaturalEnvironment, and Social Science Research Councils to continue to developprogrammes based on social need as well as scientific opportunity.14. All Research Councils give grants in response to applications fromresearch workers, mainly in universities, for support of research projects.
Usually these grants are for the provision of facilities and support staff for 2or 3 years projects; sometimes they are for substantial capital sums, e.g. pro-vision of facilities for radio astronomy at Manchester and Cambridge; oc-casionally they are in the form of programme grants which may cover 5, 7 oreven 10 years. In addition Councils enter into contracts with universities andother bodies whereby they pay the costs, including overheads, of researchwhich they initiate. The ARC, MRC and SSRC establish research Units,usually in universities with a university-employed professor as honorarydirector but otherwise staffed by Council employees. The ARC, NERC, MRCand SRC have research Institutes with independent Governing Bodies (e.g. theRothamsted Experimental Station) or managed by Research Associations (e.g.the Marine and Freshwater Biological Associations). SRC Institutes are maintained specifically to provide facilities for university research workers;facilities for university workers are also provided in other Research Councilestablishments (e.g. the NERC Research Vessel Base). All Research Councilssupport postgraduate training by awarding maintenance awards to studentsstudying for higher degrees, and MRC, NERC, SRC and SSRC award fellow-ships for post-doctoral study.15.

16. The provision tor Research Council Expenditure for 1975-76 includesan element for the relocation of the headquarters of the Science and NaturalEnvironment Research Councils in a building to be constructed in Swindon.Arts17. Within the reduced provision for the Education and Libraries, science and Arts Programme as a whole, provision is made for continuing current expenditure on maintenance of the collections of the national museums and galleries including extra assistance for 1976-77 and 1977-78 with conservationand security. Provision for the annual purchase grants for these collections hasbeen increased from 1975-76 to take account of rises in acquisition costs sincethe level of these grants was last determined in 1970. Some reduction in thecapita] provision will inevitably mean deferment of planned projects for thenational museums and galleries.18. The Annual Reports of the Arts Council and the British Film Institutegive full details of the work carried out by these bodies. The provision for the arts Council and other arts takes account of the expenses of the opening in1976 of the new National Theatre on the South Bank. The National FilmSchool cnrrently has 67 students on its roll; the first entrants completed their training courses in 1974 and a total of 34 have graduated to date. Provisioncontinues to be made for the crafts.19. There will be a further review when the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster has completed his enquiry into the financial problems of the arts.CHANGES IN PROGRAMMED expenditure the main changes from Cmnd 5879 are as follows: (a) Under-fives. The provision is reduced by amounts rising to  24 million in 1978-79.(b) Primary, Secondary and Other Schools. Recurrent expenditure is reduced by amounts rising to  157 million in 1978-79; and capitalexpenditure by amounts up to  57 million in that year.(c) Subsidies for school meals. These are reduced by  7 million in 1977-78and  40 million in 1978-79.(d) Higher and further education. Reductions up to  178 million (current)and  119 million (capital) in 1978-79 have been made.(e) Research Councils etc. The Science Budget has been reduced by amounts rising to  13 million in 1978-79.(f) The Arts. Reductions of  1 million in 1977-78 and of  9 million in1978-79 have been made.

1. There have been two changes in the scope of the programme since cmnd 5879. Expenditure on concessionary fares is now contained in theRoads and transport programme and that on mobility allowances hasbeen transferred to the Social security programme.2. The programme provides for expenditure to increase at about Hper cent a year from 1976-77 to 1979-80; within this total, current expenditure will rise by an average of 1-4 per cent a year for hospitals and community health services and 2 per cent a year for personal social services.This provision should be sufficient to maintain present standards of service for the whole population, including the rapidly increasing numbers of old people and of children in care, and to permit the continuing spread of new methods of treatment. In this situation of standstill any further improve-ments in services or the introduction of new ones will be possible only ifcorresponding savings are made elsewhere.3. It remains the Governments policy to encourage improved patterns of care and especially rehabilitation and care in the community, although in the present economic situation it will not be possible to make as much progress as the Government would have liked. In order to ensure joint planning for the best balance of provision between health and personal social services it is proposed to authorise the use of health authority alloca-tions in England on a modest scale, rising possibly to about  20 million by1979-80, for the joint financing of local authority services where it is accepted by both health and local authorities concerned that this would yield a better return in terms of total care.4. The Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) and the welsh Office will shortly be issuing Consultative Documents outlining recent developments within the Health and Personal Social Services programme inEngland and Wales, and suggesting for discussion priorities for the deploy-ment of the limited resources available. The Scottish Health ServicesPlanning Council will shortly be consulted about health service priorities in Scotland. Further information on the scale and scope of health services can be found in the annual publication &quot;Health and Personal Social ServicesStatistics&quot; for England and for Wales, in the Annual Reports of the DHSS,Scottish Home and Health Department and the Welsh Office, and in theAnnual Reports of the Chief Medical Officers of the DHSS and of the welsh Office.Hospital and community health services. For the country as a whole, much of the increase of 1-4 per cent ayear in current expenditure on hospitals and community health services will have to be devoted to those services which cater for the needs of olderpeople. The cost of all other developments, including the additional costs of running new hospitals and other facilities, will have to be met withinthe total sums available. There will thus need to be a greater emphasis onachieving the most effective use of available resources and obtainingsavings by improvements in efficiency (including where necessary the
closure of hospitals or units). A considerable amount of work has alreadybeen done on proposals to produce a more equitable distribution of resources between the various regional health authorities and the need forthis will be even greater given the constraints within which the NHS willhave to operate over the next few years. It is intended that similar principlesof redistribution should as far as possible be applied to allocations at thearea and district levels. This redistribution will have to be carried out withinthe overall growth rate of 1-4 per cent.6. Within the total level of planned expenditure, capital expenditureneeds to be reduced both in order to give priority to the maintenance of services and to prevent the burden on current expenditure resulting from new capital development exceeding the amount available in future years.Many much needed new hospitals and other developments will not now beable to proceed, and the size of other projects will have to be reduced and their timetable extended. The provision of about  300 million a year will however cover the completion of schemes under construction and allow a modest programme of new developments of high priority, together withschemes needed to maintain existing services e.g. the replacement of medicalequipment, ambulances and engineering plant. For new developmentseconomical planning and building standards will need to be widely adopted and emphasis placed wherever possible upon schemes that help to rationaliseservices and make the best use of existing buildings.Family practitioner services. Primary health care is provided by practitioners taking part in thegeneral medical, dental and ophthalmic services and the pharmaceuticalservice. Expenditure on these services is expected to grow at an average of3-3 per cent a year over the period 1976-77 to 1979-80. This rate of growthis based upon the latest estimates of the use which will be made of the range of services offered and also of the increasing numbers of doctors and dentists.8. Efforts will continue to be made to strengthen the role of the primaryhealth care services within the NHS as a whole. For example, the numberof health centres will continue to rise and this will offer increased opportunities -lies for co-operation and concerted action by multi-disciplinary teamsworking in specially designed premises.9.  The use made of the services in 1974-75 is illustrated by the following figures:Patients on doctors&apos; lists - 56-5 millionPrescriptions dispensed   327-2 millionDental treatment (courses and emergencies)   28-2 millionSight tests - 8-3 millionGlasses dispensed with NHS lenses   5-7 million the number of General Medical Practitioners has been increasing at therate of about U per cent a year and at 1 October 1974 was 25,096; theaverage number of patients on each doctors list has fallen from 2,450 in1969 to 2325 in 1974. The number of prescriptions dispensed continues to
rise at the rate of about 9-5 million a year, while dental treatments increase at about 1-5 million a year and are expected to continue to rise, thoughat a reduced rate. The number of dentists has been increasing at the rateof some 190 a year and had reached 12,704 at 1 October 1974.Personal social services10. The current expenditure programme for the personal social servicesprovides for the running costs of residential homes and day centres, andfor field social work and domiciliary services, including aids and adaptationsfor the physically handicapped. It also covers probation and after care inScotland. The 2 per cent growth in these services is sufficient to cover thecurrent costs resulting from capital investment, and to maintain existingstandards of service to those groups in the population (especially the elderlyand children in care) whose numbers are increasing. There is provisionfor a start to be made in carrying out the Children Act 1975 and thereshould also be room for some expenditure on the training recommenda-tions of the Working Party on Manpower and Training for the social services. The programme does not however allow for any general improve-ment in standards of services. Local authorities in England and Wales havebeen given guidance on the priorities for using the limited resources available in 1976-77.11. The capital programme for the personal social services will bemaintained at much the same level from year to year, but this will be lower than in recent years because of economic constraints, and in orderto bring the programme into a better balance with the likely scale of current expenditure. Within this limitation, it provides for residential accommoda-tion and day facilities for the elderly, the physically or mentally handi-capped, the mentally ill and children in care (with particular reference tothe provision of secure accommodation for this group). In the coming year,the Government will be exploring with the local authority associationsmeans of increasing the flexibility of the capital programme from year to year, and the freedom of individual authorities to decide their priorities.CHANGES IN PROGRAMMED EXPENDITURE12.  Changes in expenditure since Cmnd 5879 include:(a) A reduction of expenditure in 1976-77 of  98 million, as announced in the Budget Statement in April 1975.(b) The provision of an additional  0-2 million in 1975-76 and  4-8million in 1976-77 for capital expenditure as part of the measures announced by the Government on 24 September 1975 to assistthe construction industry.(c) Increases of  25-9 million in 1975-76 and  19-5 million in 1976-77 in expenditure on personal social services following the rate support Grant settlements made towards the end of 1975.(d) Net reductions in the programme for the years 1977-78 and 1978-79 of  93 million and  152 million respectively, reflecting changesin the forecasts, including reductions in the growth of public expenditure made as a result of this review, partly offset by anincrease in net expenditure as a result of a loss of income frompay-beds.

The general pattern of expenditure on the various social security benefits has not altered from that shown in Cmnd 5879. Retirement pensionsaccount for about half the expenditure and other contributory benefits forbetween a fifth and a quarter. The balance is made up by the non-contributory benefits, principally supplementary benefit.2. Expenditure in future years on the various individual benefits is expressed in terms of the average levels of benefit during 1975-76, whichamounts to assuming that benefits are increased from year to year at thesame rate as prices. On this presentation, differences from year to year in the cost of the various individual benefits reflect demographic and other changes affecting the number of beneficiaries.3. The Government is, however, committed to raising pensions andother long-term benefits in line with earnings (or with prices if they rise

The assumption is that upratings of the main benefits take place at yearly intervals. The precise cost of the real improvement in individualyears will depend on the future movement of earnings and prices, whichcannot be accurately forecast. To give a broad indication of what may bethe cost of such real improvements, flowing from future upratings, a lineof rounded figures is shown in Table 2.12. This line includes that part ofthe real improvement in long-term benefits in November 1975 which is notreflected in the 1975-76 average benefit level.Number of beneficiaries4.

The 1971-72 figure for sickness and injury benefits reflects the position beforethe change.(?) Numbers of qualifying children (i.e. children after the first in the family).years in the number of people over pensionable age and this is reflected inthe steady rise in the number drawing retirement pensions. People have beentending to retire earlier, and it is expected that they will continue to doso, the more so because of recent easements in the earnings rule and,for the time being also, because unemployment is so high. The growth inthe number receiving retirement pensions will, however, be less pronouncedtowards the end of the decade. The number over pensionable age claiminga supplementary pension is expected to continue to fall steadily eventhough fewer people than expected in Cmnd 5879 have chosen to give upbenefit and replace it with a rent or rate rebate. The number of claims for attendance allowances for 1975-76 is somewhat higher than was expected in Cmnd 5879, leading to an upward revision of estimates for later years.5. As regards family allowances, the number of children for whom they are paid has been expected to decline, and it is now reckoned thatthe decline will be greater than was thought when Cmnd 5879 was written.The table, however, takes no account of over 250.000 first children of single-parent families who will gain from child interim benefit from April1976, nor of some 7 million other first children who will attract childbenefit from April 1977 (see paragraph 8). Claims to the new non-contributory invalidity pension were lower in the initial claim period than had been expected, largely because many of those potentially entitled whowere already in receipt of supplementary benefit have not so far chosen

It is assumed that over the Survey period some will claim andthat the number of claimants will also increase when the benefit isextended to housewives in 1977-78.CHANGES IN PROGRAMMED EXPENDITURE6. Some of the changes in expenditure compared with Cmnd 5879derive from changed assumptions about the number of beneficiaries inthe light of the latest information. For example, the figures in the tableassume for working purposes a higher peak and a steeper fall in unemploy-ment than were shown in Cmnd 5879.7 In both April and November 1975 there were general upratings of benefits. The standard single person&apos;s rate of retirement pension, sincethe November uprating, is  13-30 a week, and the standard single person&apos;rate of both unemployment and sickness benefit is  11-10 a week. The real value of the pension, following the November uprating, was 15 per cent above the rate fixed in October 1973.8. Cmnd 5879 assumed that the retirement pension earnings rule would remain at the  13 level at which it stood prior to April 1975. Table 2.12takes into account the substitution of a  20 limit En April 1975 and a  35limit in April 1976. It is assumed that the  35 will be increased jn nnewith the movement in earnings thereafter although under existing legisla-
tion the limit would increase to  50 in April 1977. It is intended to bring forward amending legislation to substitute a dynamised  35 limit for the 50 limit.9. Family benefits have been improved and will be further extended.Table 2.12 reflects the April 1975 increase in family allowances mentionedin Cmnd 5879, and also the July 1975 increase in the levels of incomebelow which people in full-time work qualify for family income supple-ment. In April 1976 a new benefit will be available to single-parent families child interim benefit It is designed to benefit, at the rate of  1-50 aweek, such families not already receiving a social security benefit covering the first child. The expected cost in 1976-77 is  19 million. The benefit isan interim measure pending introduction of the new general scheme of child benefit in April 1977. Child benefit will replace not only family allowances and child interim benefit but also, progressively, child tax allowances. It will be paid for every child so that, unlike family allowances,it will include first children. As the rate of the allowance has not yet been settled, the costs shown in Table 2.12 do not include any extra cost of child benefit over the projected cost, at 1975-76 benefit levels, of family allowances and child interim benefit. Any such additional expenditure willbe a charge on the contingency reserve.10. Disabled persons are being helped by general improvements in bene-fits, but there will also be further developments in specific cash provisionfor them as follows:(a) The first payments of non-contributory invalidity pension for long-term sick and disabled people unable to work who do not qualify for the contributory invalidity pensions were made in November1975. The Government plans to extend non-contributory invalidity pension to married women dependent on their husbands in 1977-78. The gross cost is shown against the heading for non-contributory invalidity pension in Table 2.12; the net costs are considerably lower because there are offsetting savings in the supplementary benefit lines, and these offsets amount to about 45 million in 1977-78,(b) Mobility allowance, a benefit to help finance the transport costs of those unable to walk, was paid to the first qualifying age group in January 1976, and will be extended to all qualifying age groupswithin about three years. The cost of the mobility allowance, nowtransferred from the Health and Personal Social SendeesProgramme, is shown in Table 2.12.(c) Invalid care allowance, a benefit for those other than marriedwomen living with or mam tamed by their husbands-who areprevented from going out to work by the need to look after adisabled person who receives attendance allowance, will become payable later in 1976, The gross cost, included in Table 2.12, is 7 mfflion in 1977-78, but the net cost, after offsetting savings on supplementary benefit, is estimated to be about  2 million.U. The Governments new pensions scheme is now embodied in tbeSocial Security Pensions Act 1975. The new scheme will begin in April
1978 and the improved long-term benefits contained within the scheme will become payable from April 1979. Revised estimates of the extra expenditure arising from the scheme and included in Table 2.12 are  14million in 1978-79 and  41 million in 1979-80.12. In the difficult economic situation, the Government have only beenable to make these improvements by strict selection of priorities for thedistribution of available funds.

The net costs of the Department for National Savings are expectedto fall from about  30 million in 1976-77 to about  23 million in 1979-80partly reflecting economies in administration and partly the withdrawal ofthe savings stamp. Also included are the Treasury, including the cost ofthe UK coinage contract, the Royal Mint and certain costs incurred bythe Bank of England including the note issue, the management of thenational debt and the Bank of England&apos;s capital expenditure.Records, registrations and surveys3. This includes expenditure by several government departments (theOffice of Population, Censuses and Surveys, the General Register Office(Scotland), Land Registry. Ordnance Survey and other minor departments)and some local authority expenditure. Provision is made under the Officeof Population, Censuses and Surveys for social surveys carried out as an allied service for Government departments.

The provision for the Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys andthe General Register Office (Scotland) takes account of the cancellation ofa 100 per cent census of population in 1976, which was included in Cmnd5879, but includes the estimated cost of the preliminary work for a 100per cent census in 1981. The planned level of expenditure by the Office of population, Censuses and Surveys will invovle a reduction in the scale ofsurveys carried out for other Government departments.5. It will not be possible to expand further the Ordnance Survey digitalmapping programme during the period.Broadcasting (capital expenditure)6. Expenditure covers the capital requirements of the British Broad-casting Corporation (BBC) Home Services and the Independent broadcasting authority (IBA). Both bodies are co-ordinating separately financed pro-grammes for the construction of 625-line Ultra High Frequency (UHF)stations to transmit all BBC and IBA television services. The ultimateintention is to replace fully existing 405-line Very High Frequency (VHF )stations; present UHF coverage is about 95 per cent with a target of about99 per cent coverage by the end of 1979. The BBCs expenditure (capital and current) is financed by Government grant which at present consists ofthe whole of the net licence revenue. The IBA is financed by rentalscharged to the independent television and local radio companies. The IBAis able to borrow up to  2 million under the provisions of the IndependentBroadcasting Authority Act 1973 to finance the independent local radioservice.
Other services. The largest single item in this category is the capital investment programme of Cable and Wireless Ltd amounting to  95 million for the 5 years up to 1979-80, most of which is abroad. The company, whose sharesare wholly owned by the Government, is profitable and has consistentlypaid a dividend on the Governmenfs  30m shareholding. Its investment is largely financed from internally generated funds, the residue being made up from medium term loans from non-Governmental sources. Its principalactivity is the provision of international communication and internal tele-phone systems in a number of countries and it is an important link in theCommonwealth telecommunications network. Because in the long termcountries are likely to take over the running of their own systems, thecompany is diversifying into related telecommunications activities. the investment programme is less than Cmnd 5879 for two reasons. First, theCompany has sought to improve the realism of its forecasts. Second,account has been taken of the running down of the traditional business andthe growth of diversification: but the rate of each is necessarily uncertainat this stage.CHANGES IN PROGRAMMED expenditure. The main changes on this programme since Cmnd 5879 are theincreased cost of tax and rate collection, partially offset by the cancellation of the 1976 census and the reduced investment programme of Cable and wireless.

Capital expenditure covers the building and furnishing of new Crown-owned offices, occupational services and furnishings for newly leased officepremises, adaptations to existing offices and improvement of sub-standardoffices and minor works and furnishings in other specialised types of building.New office building, which will take place mainly outside London, includes provision for accommodating work to be dispersed from London.3. Nearly two-thirds of the office estate is rented; as the new Crown buildings which can be completed from resources available during the period will not meet all requirements, demand for extra space will continue to be met in partby hirings. It is however expected that because of the dispersal from London,where average rents are higher than elsewhere, there will be a small drop inthe rent bill at 1975 Survey prices and this trend is expected to continue beyondthe period. (Survey prices make no allowance for the fact that many existingleases are well below current market rents, and rent reviews and renewal orreplacement of leases will cause some of these rents to increase during thisperiod.)Stationery and Printing (home)4. HMSO is the central source of supply for Government departments fortheir printing, stationery and office machinery: it also supplies some other public sector bodies on repayment. HMSO is also responsible for the printing, andin most instances, the publication, distribution and sale of Government pub-lications on which the annual turnover is approximately  11 million. There havebeen reductions in planned expenditure which will necessitate further economies in the use of HMSO&apos;s services by all Government departments.
Computers and telecomrjninications5. This programme covers expenditure on the purchase, hire and mainten-ance of computer equipment for Government administrative purposes and the hire of processing time from commercial bureaux. It also includes expenditureon associated development studies and the administration cost of the CentralComputer Agency (CCA). Some expenditure by the CCA on telecommunicationsfor Government administrative purposes is also included but the major part ofsuch expenditure is included on other programmes.Home publicity6. This covers expenditure on publicity campaigns which are carried out bythe Central Office of Information and Scottish Office for other Governmentdepartments and includes the related printing costs on HMSO*s Vote. Publicityis directed principally at audiences in the United Kingdom through the mediaof press and television advertising, films, exhibitions and publications in supportof departmental policies. The reductions in planned expenditure will necessitateeconomies in the publicity programmes for all departments including the majorcontinuing campaigns.Civil Superannuation7. Provision has been made in 1975-76 for payments in respect of the accruedpension rights of Civil Servants transferred to the Civil Aviation Authority.The rising trend of the later forecasts reflect the increasing number of retirementsexpected in these years.Other common services. This programme covers the costs of legal services, the government actuary, Civil Service Catering Services and transport services.CHANGES IN PROGRAMMED expenditure. Since Cmnd 5879 the main changes in 1976-77 are due to the reduction in public spending in 1976-77 announced in the Budget on 15 April 1975; and in later years are due to the general need to reduce the rate of growth in public expenditure. The upward trend of expenditure from 1975-76 shown in Cmnd5879 has been reversed.10. Reductions in the maintenance and running costs of the Governmentsestate are difficult and the bulk of the cuts fall on capital expenditure (with consequential reductions in departmental administration). The figures reflectan increase in expenditure on construction of buildings to house work dispersedfrom London, as this is more economical than leasing and often the only practicable solution. In 1976-77 it has also been necessary to allocate funds forthe protection of key buildings from bomb attacks.

Inevitably a number of the improvements whichwere planned in various services will not now take place. There has alsobeen a switch of resources, averaging about  20 million a year over theperiod to 1979-80, from the programmes of Northern Ireland depart-ments to the programme of the Northern Ireland Office to help the latter to meet the Government^ responsibility for law and order in NorthernIreland.3. Cmnd 5879 referred to further measures in the field of social andeconomic planning which were then under examination but which had notprogressed to the stage at which their financial implications could be assessed. In the event, because of the need to restrict the growth of public expenditure, no additional resources have been made available for social and economic reconstruction; room has nevertheless been found in the
existing programme for the most important of those further measures.Priority has been given to housing; to the creation of jobs in areas of high unemployment; and to those aspects of other programmes such as health and education which can directly bring help and relief to areas of specialdeprivation. To allow greater concentration on these priorities reductionshave had to be made in other programmes, such as roads and comprehensivedevelopment schemes in city and town centres. Administrative economieshave also been made and the growth of the public service has been severelycurtailed.4. The figures reflect the continuing efforts to preserve existing jobs in industry and agriculture, while maintaining provision for the promotion of new jobs in the difficult current economic climate. The number of jobspromoted in manufacturing industry during the past 5 years has been about30,000, while in the same period some 36,000 jobs have been preservedby Government assistance. The provision over the next 5 years would allow for a similar overall level of activity. Provision is made for financialassistance to Harland and Wolff up to March 1979 under the shipbuilding industry (No. 2) (Northern Ireland) Order 1975.5. A recent survey has shown that the condition of the housing stock inNorthern Ireland is worse than in any other region. Greater emphasis will therefore be placed on the rehabilitation, repair and improvement of exist-ing houses in order to increase the quality and number of houses availablefor occupation. In addition the Survey provision will be large enough toallow rather more new houses to be completed in the public sector overthe next 5 years than the 36,406 which were completed in the past 5 years.6. Provision under, Law, order and protective services includes the costsinvolved in the expected increase in the numbers in prison, progress in thechange-over from compounds to cells, and the building of a new permanentprison; this is after taking into account the effect of releases from detention.Savings will be achieved by the suspension of plans for a new PoliceTraining College and through an estimated decline in the costs of compensa-tion for Criminal Injuries. Commitments for the expansion announced in1974 in the strength of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and Royal ulster constabulary Reserve will continue to be met.7. The figures take account of the application to Northern Ireland ofpolicy changes agreed for the rest of the United Kingdom. These includethe decisions announced in &quot;The Attack on Inflation&quot; (Cmnd 6151) andthe measures for the relief of unemployment announced by the Governmentin September and December 1975. The total allocation to Northern Irelandunder these measures is about  9 million, falling mainly in the years1975-76 and 1976-77.
16.  CONTINGENCY RESERVE AND SHORTFALLrable 2.16  million at 1975 Survey prices1975-761976-771977-781978-791979-80Contingency reserveGeneral deduction forshortfall-250700-250900-2501,200-2501,400Contingency reserve1. The summary tables of total public expenditure (Tables 1.4 and4.1) include a contingency reserve. This is intended to cover a number ofdifferent types of expenditure.2. First, not all the policies announced by the Government have yetbeen developed to the point where cost estimates can be determined with sufficient precision to include them in expenditure programmes. examples are the expenditure of the British National Oil Corporation and any additional cost of the child benefit scheme and of devolution. Thus part ofthe contingency reserve is already subject to claims. Second, the reserve is meant to cover the cost of expenditure which may need to be undertaken in pursuance of existing policies but which cannot yet be foreseen with anyprecision (this includes new projects in some categories of industrialsupport); and the net cost of any modifications in such policies which theGovernment may find it necessary to introduce at any time during the years ahead. Third, it allows for the possibility that the Government will haveto respond to some unpredictable events, such as natural disasters in theUnited Kingdom, which may arise during the period.3. In Cmnd 5879 the contingency reserve was, exceptionally, expressedin terms of demand on resources. This was because the policies which were already known to involve a potential call on the contingency reserveincluded some which mainly involved the purchase of existing assets; andthere was therefore an unusually large potential difference between thedemand content of some of the likely developments over the next few yearsand their cost in money. As, however, the public expenditure arising from most of the proposals of that kind has now been incorporated in the relevantprogrammes, the present White Paper reverts to the former practice of expressing the reserve in volume terms.General deduction for shortfall4. Tables 1.4 and 4.1 also include a general deduction for shortfall, notallocated to particular programmes. This deduction is also expressed in volume terms.5. However carefully estimates and plans are made, it is impossibleto guarantee that expenditure will follow them precisely. The incidence ofthe individual excesses and shortfalls has varied from year to year, but
experience has generally been that in total the under-spendings comparedwith the planned level for the current year outweigh the over-spendings.One of the reasons for this is the unpredictable delay which can occur insome major capital projects. For this reason a specific shortfall deductionis also included within the nationalised industries&apos; capital expenditure programme. The general deduction for shortfall is intended to cover thenet under-spending which occurs over the programmes as a whole, but which it is not possible to allocate in advance to any individual programme.
17.  DEBT INTEREST1975-76    1976-77    1977-78    1978-79    1979-80Debt interest 5,000        6,200      7,000      7,500        7,500Changes from Cmnd 5879 revalued     +450     +1.750    + 2.700    +3.300 -1. The summary tables of total public expenditure include estimates of debt interest. Debt interest is currently about 10 per cent of public expenditure. It is not amenable to policy decisions in the same senseas other expenditure; it is largely determined by the size of the public sector debt outstanding and rates of interest fixed in the past.2. Public sector borrowing has risen steeply in recent years, frombalance in 1970 to  4 billion in 1973 and  6 billion in 1974, and is currentlynearly double that level. Interest rates have also risen considerably overthe period. Consequently the cost of servicing the debt has risen sub-stantially and because of the cumulative effect of borrowing seems likelyto continue to rise in the next few years. This has made forecastingdifficult and the estimates inevitably become less dependable as one movesfurther into the future. The future levels of debt interest at constant prices depend not only on the size of outstanding debt and the interestpayable on it, the amount of new borrowing and of debt maturing andneeding to be renewed and the rate of interest which has to be paid on it, but also on future rates of inflation.3. The recession, attributable in part to the sharp rise in oil prices,has been an important factor in the recent increase in the public sectorborrowing requirement; measures to increase taxation or reduce expendi-ture would have led to an even faster growth of unemployment As theworld economy recovers the Government intends that public sector borrow-ing should be reduced steadily to a normal level in relation to national income. However this still entails a continuing increase in debt outstanding.4. Inflation has contributed to the growth in debt interest payments,through its effect on the level of interest rates. However inflation hasalso mitigated the real burden they impose; since much of debt interest is fixed for long periods in cash terms its real cost is dependent on thelevel of prices. At constant prices debt interest has increased by only about a quarter in the last five years, from  4 billion in 1970-71 to an estimated  5 billion this year. Following the initiation of the counter-inflation policy set out in &quot;The Attack on Inflation&quot; (Cmnd 6151) therate of inflation is falling and in the next few years will be significantlybelow recent high levels. This fall should affect interest rates too, butthis will only help with new debt and that part of the old debt that fallsdue for redemption. So far as the real cost of debt interest is concerned,decelerating inflation will substantially reduce the extent to which theburden is eroded by the falling value of money.
5. Total public sector debt interest this year is expected to amount tosome  5 billion. The high level of borrowing at present and in therecent past means that further large increases in interest payments willbe unavoidable next year and in 1977-78. At constant prices interest payments are expected to rise by about  1 billion in each of thenext two years and reach  7-5 billion in 1978-79 and 1979-80. This repre-sents a large increase in the estimates compared with Cmnd 5879, amountingto over  3 billion in 1978-79. As indicated above, this increase can be attributed to two main causes: the current scale of the borrowing require-ment which was insufficiently anticipated when the last White paper was being prepared, and the additional real cost imposed by a given levelof debt interest at lower rates of inflation.6. The debt interest burden falls largely on the Exchequer, and thuson the taxpayer, but it does not fall on the nation as a whole exceptinsofar as the debt is held abroad. About one seventh of debt interest is paid abroad and represents a charge on the balance of payments whichhas to be offset by increased exports or fewer imports if our overseasfinancial position is not to deteriorate. The remainder of debt interestrepresents an internal transfer of purchasing power. A good deal of itreturns to the Exchequer in tax, and of the remainder it is believed thata considerable proportion is saved (adding, for example, to pension funds).Consequently the demand which it places on real resources is lower,  for  , than the average demand placed on resources by the public expenditure programmes.7. The reductions made to the spending programmes in future years will therefore have a far more significant effect on the demand on domesticresources than will the increased estimates of debt interest. Neverthelessmoney has to be found to meet the full liability; and insofar as it doesnot come from increased tax receipts or lower spending on the programmes,borrowing will be increased.

In the course of negotiations with theConvention of Scottish Local Authorities about rate support grant for 1976-77it became clear that the levels of expenditure actually incurred in 1974-75 and likely to be incurred in 1975-76 were both considerably higher than had been assumed for the purposes of the rate support grant settlements for those years.However, because of difficulties in obtaining sufficiently accurate informationfollowing the reorganisation of local government on 16 May 1975, it has not yetbeen possible in the table to provide firm estimates of the higher out turns likely in those years. For 1975-76, current expenditure may turn out to be close to thefigure shown for 1976-77. For that year the figures in the table are consistent with the rate support grant settlement. As indicated in paragraph 41 of Part I,plans for expenditure on individual local authority services in the period beyond1976-77 have not yet been discussed with the Convention of Scottish LocalAuthorities.

The figures are contained within the totals shown inTables 2.4, 2.6 to 2.8, 2.10, 2.11 and 2.13. The objectives and main deter-minants of the expenditure are explained in the commentaries on thosetables.2. The changes in the Welsh figures as compared with Cmnd 5879 reflect the general reduction in spending in 1976-77 announced in the April 1975Budget statement; and further reductions in capital and current programmes in later years as a result of this review. The Trade, industry and employ-ment programme takes account of the setting up of the Welsh DevelopmentAgency and the transfer to the Welsh Office of responsibility for selectiveassistance to industry formerly carried out in Wales by the Department ofIndustry. Provision is made under Other environmental services for the implementation of the Community Land Scheme.

Estimates of expenditure &quot;in cost terms&quot; are intended to showchanges in the real cost of expenditure, taking into account changes inrelative prices, which affect the cost of expenditure in terms of other expenditure forgone, but discounting the effect of general price increases.So far as the past is concerned, the figures are arrived at by adjustingcash figures to a 1975-76 basis, using the GDP deflator (the index ofhome costs) as a proxy for changes in prices in general. Estimates on a comparable basis for future years are derived by adjusting volume esti-mates (at 1975-76 prices) to take account of estimated trends in relativeprices of certain elements in costs, particularly wages and salaries and housing and construction costs; in practice there can be a good deal offluctuation about trends, and these estimates are not forecasts for specificyears.2.

Productive potential varies with changesin the size of the working population, in the average number of hours worked and in productivity The actual level of output gross domestic product varies with changes in the degree of use of productive capacity.
Pubiic corporations nationalised industries^ new town corporations andother enterprises publicly owned and managed in the public interest, as described in Chapter VII of &quot;National Accounts Statistics: Sources and methods&quot;. (Direct government trading activities are not included.)Pubiic expenditure the current and capital expenditure of central govern-rneflt and local authorities, other than expenditure charged to the operatingaccount of trading bodies, together with the capital expenditure of nationalised industries and other public corporations, and including debt interest and net lending. The estimates of public expenditure in this white paper are net of charges and do not include imputed rent.Recasting- revised estimate at constant prices of the expenditure requiredto implement a given policy; not to be confused with revaluation (Handbookon Methodology, paragraphs 106-7).Revaluation the process of adjusting estimates of expenditure io a differentprice basis-in particular, adjusting estimates in the January 1975 white paper (Crond 5879) to lake account of pay and price changes in the twelvemonths since those estimates were prepared; not to be confused withrecosting (Handbook on Methodology, paragraphs 1Q2-3). See Section ITbelow for the price basis of expenditure affected by foreign exchange rates.Shortfall-see Chapter 16 in Part 2.Supply expenditure-expenditure by central government which is financed by monies voted by Parliament. Details are given in the Supply estimates and Appropriation Accounts. In this White Paper it also Includesexpenditure on the Votes of Northern Ireland departments.Transfer payments-payments for which no goods or services are received in return. They include social security benefits, grants to individuals and companies, and debt interest.II  Price basbO1. Unless otherwise stated, the figures of public expenditure in this white Paper are expressed at constant prices. There are, however, twoconstant price series which serve different purposes, each having its ownsignificance and importance.In volume terms-at1975 Survey prices (Table 1.4)2. The figures embodied in the White Paper described as being atSurvey prices are produced on the assumption that prices throughout theperiod covered have been, and will remain, at the levels prevailing at the base date for the annual (1975) Survey. Such figures measure changes inthe amount of goods and services purchased by the public sector, and thusprovide an indication of the volume of services supplied (hence they are(i) A more detailed account u given in Chapter IV of the Handbook on Metho-dology.
sometimes also referred to as figures in volume terms). They are ofimportance both because prospective changes in the scale of individual services are a natural matter of interest and because it is in terms of thesefigures that the programmes are in practice planned. Programmeshave to be planned in terms of the underlying activities (eg numbers ofstaff employed; goods and services purchased) needed to give effect toGovernment policies. These therefore are the figures displayed throughoutthe individual programme tables in Part 2 and discussed in the accompany-ing commentaries and summarised in Table 1.4.In cost terms including the relative price effect (Table 4.1)3. In considering public expenditure decisions it is necessary to take account not only of the volume of services of various types it is desiredto provide, but also their prospective cost. The relative costs of differentgoods and services are indicated at any time by their current prices. Pro-objections in volume terms are at prices of the base date, and do not reflectrelative costs in other years. But in practice these price relationships change;some goods, and the cost of some public expenditure programmes, risefaster in price than others. It is not practicable to forecast actual prices, butthe prices of some classes of goods and services have a fairly well definedtendency to rise faster than, and the prices of others to lag behind, theaverage price of GDP; and it is therefore possible to establish trends inrelative prices. By projecting these trends estimates can be made, in broadterms, of this relative price effect in coming years. Fluctuations in relativeprices about their trends in the past were small, and until last year itwas not thought necessary to take account of them in estimating relative price effect. In the last two years however there have been some markedchanges in price relationships; in particular there has been a very sharpincrease in building costs. The method of estimation has therefore been revised to take account of deviations of relative prices from, and theirsubsequent reversion towards, long term trend levels. On the other hand,a review of the situation has shown a high degree of uncertainty in manycases about cost trends and their relation to current levels. This yearspecific allowance for the relative price effect has been made only in thecases of wages and salaries and land, housing and construction costs.4. Volume projections adjusted by the relative price effect are saidto be in cost terms, including the relative price effect. These figures enable a comparison to be made of the relative costs of different programmes inthe coming years. They can also be used to estimate the relation which theywill bear, individually and in total, to national output at the price levelsappropriate to those years. The constant price basis used for figures in costterms is estimated 1975-76 prices ie the level of prices paid in 1975-76&quot; rather than Survey prices which do not at all refer to the same date.Table 4.1 is in cost terms throughout. A reconciliation with figures in volume terms at 1975-76 prices, showing the relative price effect, is shownat the foot of the table.Market and factor cost prices \5.  The basic survey price figures are market prices, inclusive of indirect
taxes and net of any subsidies. In estimating the demand effect or resourcecost of expenditure the indirect tax element is irrelevant; as demand itquickly returns to the Exchequer, and it does not make any call on the basic factors of production, labour, capital and imports. Subsidies corre-spondjngly cause market prices to under-estimate demand and resourcecost. For this reason factor cost prices, net of indirect taxes and withsubsidies added back, are used in the resources Table 1.1, and in the cal-speculation of the demand effect. In the case of the transfer and lendingelement of public expenditure further adjustments are necessary to take account of the proportion which does not enter into final expenditure on goods and services, because it is paid in direct taxation or saved.Foreign exchange rales6. Estimates of expenditure which are directly affected by foreign exchange rates reflect average rate prevailing in October 1974, the date rele-vant for costing most programmes in this White Paper. Actual pay-ments will of course reflect the rates prevailing when those payments are made. However, the contributions to the European Communities are,under the budget regulations, based on a rate of 2-4 units of account tothe  .Ill  OsjssBtcation changes1. The following transfers between programmes reflect changes whichhave occurred since the 1975 public expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 5879)in organisation and reassessment of the functions of some elements ofexpenditure:(a) Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies. The addition of this new item has involved several changes: derelict land clearance,land and buildings, town and country planning have been trans-ferred from Other environmental services to Trade, industryand employment.(b) Nationalised Industries&apos; Consumer Councils-Nationalised Indus-tries to Trade, industry and employment.(c) Local authority Concessionary fares-from Health and personal social services to Social security.(d) Mobility allowance-from Health and personal social services to social security.(e) Prison supplies and certain transport services and administrative services-transferred from Common Services and reallocatedbetween Roads and transport, Law, order and protective servicesand Other environmental services.(f) Expenditure in respect of the purchase of mechanical handlingappliances (fork-lift trucks etc)-transfeiTed from common services to several other programmes.(g) Some Research Council expenditure-from Health and personal social services to Other environmental services following theBiological Standards Act 1975.
(h) Stationery and printing for Museums and Galleries-from Com-mon services to Education and libraries, science and arts.(i) Redistribution of some Northern Ireland expenditure betweenvarious programmes.2. From 1975-76 onwards British Gas Corporation replacementexpenditure will be treated as current rather than capital expenditure; andconsequently will no longer form part of public expenditure.

Table 1.1 shows possible increases between 1974 and 1979 in thetotal resources available to the nation and illustrates the way these increasesmay be divided between alternative uses. This note describes and definesthe various items in the table. All the figures are in volume terms.2. The first column of the table shows the use of the nation&apos;s resources in the year 1974. The figures are all in demand terms at 1970 factor costprices. For indirect public expenditure the figures are estimates of thedemand effects at factor cost flowing from transfers etc made in 1974although these demand effects may not be reflected exactly in that year.3. Section A shows the supply of resources available for domesticuse. Line 1 shows three possible rates of grawth in GDP. These reflectdifferent assumptions about the rate of growth of productive potential.4. Line 2 shows the balance of trade in goods and services. As stated above, both exports and imports are valued at constant 1970 prices. Theestimated deficit in 1974 at 1970 prices is much lower than the actualdeficit at the prices of 1974 because a large part of the deficit was dueto the deterioration in the terms of trade between 1970 and 1974, princi-pally on account of the higher price of oil.5. GDP less the balance of trade surplus (or, as in 1973, plus the deficit) constitutes the resources available for use at home, shown in line 3.ft. Section B is a summary of the competing claims on these resources.Line la shows private fixed investment (other than in housing) andstock-building, whilst nationalised industries&apos; investment and stock-buildingare shown in line lb. The remainder (line 2) is then available for other public expenditure and for private consumption.7. Section C provides a breakdown of this remainder into the com-components of other public expenditure (lines la to. e) and personal consump-tion (lines 2a to c).
8. The changes to total public expenditure between 1974 and 1979,as shown in lines la to e together with line lb of Section B, are consistent with the estimates shown elsewhere in this White Paper. Differences in rates of increase are due to differences in the periods over which the changes are measured and to differences between the conventions anddefinitions used in the planning and control of public expenditure andin the National Accounts; the latter are employed in this table.9. Lines la to c of Section C show direct public expenditure on goods and services. Line la, public consumption, includes all current expenditureon goods and services and line lb, public investment, includes both fixed investment and stock-building by public authorities and public corporationsother than nationalised industries, included in line lb of Section B.10. Line Id shows indirect public expenditure. This attempts to estimate the effect on private expenditure of various forms of payments such as national insurance benefits and other current grants, subsidies and debt interest. The resource implications of overseas transfers, however, havebeen retained in the balance of trade figures and those of capital grants in the investment figures of the sectors which receive them.11. Line 2c shows personal consumption, which consists in this table of consumers&apos; expenditure plus investment in dVellings. This item canthen be split approximately into two components: publicly financed personal consumption (line 2b) which is the same as indirect public expenditure(line Id) and privately financed consumption (line 2a) which is a measureof personal consumption of goods and services purchased at factor costout of wages and salaries, income from self-employment and profits.12. All the figures in the table are in demand terms. The methodsused for the calculation of demand effects are explained in chapter Vof &quot;Public Expenditure White Papers: Handbook on Methodology&quot; the conventional national accounting presentation on which the table is basedis folly explained in &quot;National Accounts Statistics: Sources and Methods&quot;(HMSO 1968), especially Chapters I to HI.
