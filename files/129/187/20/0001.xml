. DEVELOPMENT LAND TAX bill memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food.    The justification for a lower initial rate of tax turns on a judgementas to whether land will come forward quickly enough for housing development.It was not linked to roll-over relief in the Cabinet decision on 5 February(CC(76) 4th Meeting, Item 6).2.     I consider the decision to grant roll-over relief should be maintainedirrespective of the decision taken on the rate of tax, for the following reasons -i. Roll-over is a deferment of tax, not an exemption from it, andthe grant of the relief is directly related to investment. That is what we want.   Honey saved by a lower tax rate could not be so directed.ii. To restore confidence in agriculture we need to demonstrate our support for it.   Removal of roll-over will be seen as a direct blow to that confidence.iii. The lower rate would obtain for only a short period.3.     I, therefore, seek my colleagues agreement that, whatever may bedecided about the rate of tax, the Cabinet decision of 5 February aboutroll-over relief, should stand.T F ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food17 February 1976C(76) 20 COPY NO 8117 February 1976CABINET
