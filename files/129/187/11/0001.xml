C(76) 1110 February 1976FUEL BILLS AND DISCONNECTIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Energy1.        In the recent cold spell there was and remains a strong expression of public concern for the plight of old people who may find it difficult to pay for sufficient warmth to prevent the risk of ill-health and even death due tocold.    Fear of the sudden removal of warmth and light by disconnection of gas and electricBy supplies may lead such people to run undue risks to theirhealth.    I reported this situation and my proposals in minutes to the PrimeMinister of 2 and 6 February and was invited, by the Prime Ministersminute of 4 February, to submit a paper.background.        There are arrangements whereby the gas and electricity industries,having extended credit for at least 5 or 6 weeks from the date of an account,and given warning of the risk of disconnection, suspend disconnection for14 days for people apparently suffering genuine hardship and refer them tothe Supplementary Benefit Commission.    The social service agencies then consider whether financial help can be given or other arrangements madeto deal with existing debts and avoid further debt arising.    Various easypayment schemes and the provision of some pre-payment me tors areavailable to help people to keep up with their payments subsequently.    Thesocial services theoretically guarantee the cost of the fuel consumed duringthe 14 day or, if necessary, longer stay of disconnection while all these measures are being brought to bear.PROPOSED ACTION3.        Cases continue to be reported which appear to have slipped through this safety net due to human error.    We must make sure that old peopleafraid of running into debt do not starve themselves of essential warmth intheir efforts to avoid overspending.    Old people are of course especiallyvulnerable to extreme cold.    I believe we can no longer fail to recognise the pressures to which old people are thus subjected as a result of high fuelprices.copy NO81CABINET
4.        I am therefore asking the gaB and electricity industries if they can take further steps to lift the fear of disconnection from the old.    Inparticular, I am raising with them the possibility of a temporary suspension of disconnection for households consisting solely of pensioners.    There isof course no statutory requirement to disconnect.    It is in every casedie ere tionar y.HOUSEHOLDS AFFECTED5.        The number of housholds consisting solely of pensioners isestimated at 4^ million.    There are 1. 7 million where state pensions aloneaccount for three-quarters of the household Income, and are likely toinclude those in fuel payment difficulties.    This figure might be roundedto 2 million to include those all-pensioner households with rather higherincomes who might well find difficulty in meeting their bills.FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES6.        We must allow for the possibility that the Electricity Boards inEngland and Wales and British Gas Corporation will ask for compensationfor any costs they incur.    But these costs - if they arise - would be verysmall indeed and I should require to be convinced that savings made by the boards could not meet them, before agreeing to consider recompensing the boards.   Even if all the 2 million pensioners mentioned above failed to pay for 6 months  (assuming the temporary arrangements lasted for this period),tho interest charges would be about  6 million.    In fact, however, this figure is a theoretical maximum and pensioners are highly responsible andkeen to preserve their independence.    Last year about 120, 000 people weredisconnected, and only a tiny proportion of these were pensioners.    Atpresent, the Boards are disconnecting hardly any pensioners,    it is possible,indeed probable, that the arrangements proposed would increase the spendunder the social services votes but this is not quantifiable.    Moreover ifdisconnections are suspended the Boards will have a stronger vested interestin clearing the bills with the social services, which they do not now have.This could lead to earlier payments and is preferable to the present arrange-ment.    Action through the Courts for payments would still be open to theBoard.    Where a Court Order was made there could be no objection todisconnection on the part of the Board, at their discretion.7.        I recognise that mere may be pressure for the arrangements to beextended to other groups.    But I believe that the public generally recognisethat old age pensioners form a very special group, subject to particular riskand one defined by an objective criterion - age.    Moreover the fact that noprecedents on disconnection have yet been established has not staved off the pressure to help the old now.2
CONCLUSION AND recommendation.        To a large extent pensioner households are already protected fromprecipitate disconnection, but I propose to meet the current public concernby announcing the arrangements being made by the industries in a statement to the House of Commons.    I am also proposing to announce the setting up,under Lord Lovell-Davis, of an informal review with the industries of the procedures for payment of bills by gas and electricity consumers.9.        I accordingly invite my colleagues to agree to my making a statement as suggested in paragraph 8, a draft of which has alteady been circulated with my minute of 6 February.A W BDepartment of Energy10 February 19763
