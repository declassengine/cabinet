COPY NO      q 1C(76) 1416 February 1976 0 1CABINETDEVELOPMENT LAND TAX bill note by the Chancellor of the exchequer attach a paper by the Paymaster General.D W treasury Chamber!16 February 1976
(confidential)CABINETDEVELOPMENT LAND TAX bill memorandum BY THE   PAYMASTER general it was agreed at the meeting on 5th February that:-(a) the rate of DLT should be &amp;0% from the outset;(b) the exemption limit should be  10,000 rather than 5,000(c) a limited form of roll-over relief should be granted.However,  in the light of the concern of some Ministers about thisdecision,  the Minister for Planning and Local Government and I were invited to consider whether there would be merit in the alternative of a lower rate of tax being charged on a first large trancheof,say  250,000,  and the higher rate on the remainder.     (CC(?6) ^thMeeting,  Item 6).2.    The Minister for Planning and Local Government and I have discussed this.    He would   prefer neither lower rate tranche norroll-over,  while I would prefer both.    He and I have however agreedto commend to our colleagues the following compromise:-(i)  for the period up to 31st March 1979 there would be atranche of  150,000 of development value realised in ayear (over and above the exempt  10,000)  taxable at 66^6;(ii)  the balance would be charged at 8o%;(iii)  there would be no roll-over relief.3.    This compromise would have the merit of giving a considerableinducement for owners to bring forward land quickly for housingdevelopment,  so reducing the risks of a shortage of housing land,while ensuring that large speculative gains,  which have rightlycaused public concern, would be taxed at an effective rate of nearly80%.    It would avoid the practical problems that roll-over reliefcould cause local authorities when they buy net of DLT.-(confidential)
(confidential)k.    The temporary lower rate tranche would help industrial development in the next few critical years by giving a general inducement tobring  forward land for it.     On the other hand it  would not  fullyoffset  the loss of roll-over relief in the  few cases where it  would apply,   namely where  firms were contemplating vacating  sites with considerable development potential.    Although the Secretary ofState for Industry would,  like me,  have preferred a larger trancheand retention of roll-over relief,  he is prepared to support the compromise outlined above as being,  on balance,  better for industry than the earlier decision.5.    The lower rate tranche would in some cases be more advantageous to farmers than roll-over relief.    But it has the disadvantages ofnot being so when a large part of the development value is reinvestedin fixed plant and buildings  (presumable only possible in thesmaller cases)  and of only being temporary.    The Minister ofAgriculture is therefore not prepared to support the compromise.6.    While I recognise the reasons for the misgivings of theMinister of Agriculture,  I think that on balance the compromise is preferable to the original decision both in relation to the aims of the Community Land Act and in relation to our economicpriorities.7-    I therefore seek the agreement of colleagues to introducing the Bill on the lines set out in paragraph 2,E D(confidential^
