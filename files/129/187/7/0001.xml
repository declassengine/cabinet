(confidsntjal)2 February 1976STUDENTS1 FINANCE AND UlTEHPLOYKEKTMemorandum by the Chief Secretary to the treasury attach a note by ay officials.     I agree v.-Ith them that thecentral question in this matter now is whether students should look to the student support system or to unemployment benefit orsupplementary benefit for necessary financial help for their .vacations.     I agree aiSo that the right choice is the studentsupport cyr, t c m.2.     i recommend to my colleagues the following action:(1)   We should announce as soon as possible the intention to publish statistics of unemployment separately from statistics of students who register for employment in vacations, andapply this practice not later than the count in March.(Paragraph 6 of the attached note.), Unless we can prevent the number of registered unemployedthis spring from appearing to be much increased simply because students are on vacation we shall face an unnecessarilyhostile climate for discussion with the TUC of policies towardsemployment and the continued attack on inflation.The counts up to March will be made during the presentuniversity term.     The April count will be made in thevacation but announced after the sunnier university term has begun.I recognise that the present practice was agreed between theParties when we were in Opposition.     But siuoe we Look officeOpposition spokesmen have criticised the coverage of the un-employment figures as too wide.     More important, however, is(confidential&quot;) _
the risk that in present circumstances the presence of largeanxiously doing so with all too few vacancies to apply for.&apos;In our announcement we should indicate also our intentionfirst to adjust the system of student support as soon aspossible so as virtually to obviate students1 use ofunemployment and supplementary benefits in the short vacationsand in due course to amend the legislation on those benefitsso that, in ordinary circumstances, students would not be eligible for them in any vacation.(2)   7/e should instruct officials to explore immediately&quot;with those concerned outside the Government the feasibility of a plan which my officials suggest for arranging a specialpayment of grants to students at the end of the presentEaster term so that the element for the Easter vacation willbe large enough to make it unprofitable for them to go through the process of registering for employment in orderto claim supplementary benefit.    (Paragraph 7.and Annex Iof the attached note.)   This would in effect advance the interim scheme, already agreed by the Social services committee, whereby the student grant will be regarded ascovering the period from 1 October to 30 June only.3.     I would be content that my colleagues should consider the issues set out in Part II of my officials note separately -though as soon as possible, - at a further meeting of the cabinet or in Cabinet Committee.numbers of students on the ecploynciit registers &quot;her. theyare not genuinely seeking work will affront those who areilJBKm TreasuryLondon SW1-2-(confidential)
(COrSriDSMTJAL)STUKEKTS&apos; FITAIICE AKX3 Ui:Ei-IFIOYrSLI?&apos;Note &quot;by tbe treasury this note concerns a set of problems which result from the inter-action of several important policies of the Government.Decisions by Ministers are needed quickly on three points.Part I concerns the question of action to prevent the numberof registered unemployed this spring from appearing to bemuch increased simply because students will be on vacation.Part II concerns two questions:(a) Shall child tax allowances be withdrawn fron parentsof students when, on the introduction of child benefits,they are withdrawn from other parents?(b) What consequential changes should be made in thesystem of student support if child tax allowances are withdrawn from students?PART IMinisters&apos; decisions so far2.     For the purpose of keeping students -oft the unemploymentregisters in the Easter vacation, Ministers approved in Novemberan interim scheme.     This involved local education authoritiespaying additional grant of  5 to students before that vacation, inorder to obviate claims to supplementary benefit, for which theywould need to have registered as unemployed.     The Department ofEducation and Science, however, when the^ consulted the localauthorities, found them in support of the principle but opposed on grounds of administrative cost and difficulty, and because of thecontrast between incurring additional expenditure ( 2 million in1975-76) for this purpose and the reductions which they are underpressure to make in their owe services.
Z*     Ministore have decided that fron April ^97? fp^ily *m.owonr*sand child tax allowances will be replaced by cash payments, to beucalled child benefits, for all children up to age 16 and for children in non-advanced education up to age 19-     This change will involve -(i)   the presentational problem of increasing the totals ofboth public expenditure and tax receipts; and(ii)   net extra Exchequer cost from &quot;977-73 estimated by the .Treasury at not less than  115 million, while the Departmentof Health and Social Security believe this to be some  30million too low.     The exact amount will depend on the rate of child benefit which Ministers will need to decide during March.The forthcoming White Paper on public expenditure will treat thenet extra Exchequer cost as a charge on the contingency reserve,where it will be contributing to the increasing burden of taxationwhich is in prospect - as the White Paper will admit - over theperiod to 1979-80.4.     Ministers have also decided that child benefits shall not &apos;s.extend to students of any age in higher education or advancedfurther education, nor to students of 19 and over in non-advanced&apos;  further education, for all of whom there is already a virtuallymcommon system of support.The unemployment registers at Easter5.     In accordance with a &quot;white Paper of 1972 - &quot;UnemploymentStatistics&quot; (Cmnd 5157) - unemployment statistics include studentsregistered for employment.     The arrangements in that White paper were agreed between all Parties.     The unemployment count in Marchwill be taken on the 11th, which is a few days before the Eastervacation begins.     The April count will he taken on 8 April, andunder present arrangements will include any students on theregister on that day.     But the count will not he published until22 April, by which time students will have returned to theiruniversities.
(CONFIDENTIAL)6.     Ministers will wish to consider whether they u^eu lu V-by the 1972 wHite Paper.     The situation in 1976 is very different from that in 1972, when the problem of unemployment was less acuteand only a handful of students made a practice of registering fcremployment.     It is arguable that the inclusion of students also:,^ -the unemployed could cause resentment in the present situation.Ministers may feel, therefore, that in any event they should presentfigures.published in April of students who will have been registeredf or emplo^iueut in Ihe previous vacation as separate from theunemployed.     On this basis the only figures of the unemployed inthe Press release each month would be those which excluded students and school leavers.     The January figures, for example, would havebeen 1.2 million and 5-2 per cent, instead of 1.4 million and 6.1per cent.       Figures for students could be given, if necessary, ona separate occasion.     It would be essential, however, that ministers should have given public warning well id advance oftheir intention to do this.7.     Ministers may, however, consider it essential to discouragestudents from registering for employment en masse in the Eastervacation, in order to obviate the problem of excluding them fromunemployment statistics.     In view of the objections which thelocal authorities have raised to the original scheme which ministers approved in principle for this purpose, the Treasuryhas considered the possibility of an alternative scheme in whichthe part to be played by the local authorities would be minimised.This scheme is outlined in Annex i of this paper.PART IIStudent support and child tax allowances8.     This Fart of this note recommends the following action:(1).   As regards longer term arrangements, riinisters should decide that child tax allowances should be discontinued forparents of students as well as for parents of children(confidential)
generally on the introduction of the child b?r.^fit rrch-r-.(Paragraph 9 below.) ^ &apos;       ^(2)   On the withdrawal of child tax allowances from students1parents, students&apos; grants should be increased without reduction &apos;of parental contributions so that a student&apos;s resources for avacation would be reasonably comparable with incoiae which estudent registered as unemployed may now derive in the vacationfrom supplementary aenefit at the single non-householder rate;and students1 eligibility to unemployment benefit, and to supplementary benefit on grounds of unemployment, should thenbo withdrawn by legislation.     (Paragraphs 10-12 and tb* firrtoption in Annex II, below.)9.     Inland Revenue hope that Ministers will decide to discontinuechild tax allowances for students when they are discontinued for children generally.     This would avoid maintaining a vestigialsystem which would always be subject to pressure to extend it again;and it would avoid the disproportionate cost of applying the allow-ances to a small group of parents for a limited period determinedcase by case.10.    If child tax allowances were discontinued for students their parents would pay some  43 million more in tax at basic rate onthat account.     They would also have lost  1 million in family allowances.     It would thus be the more difficult for the parentsto find the parental contributions which are assumed in calculatingstudents&apos; grants.     Possible means of relieving this difficultyhave, on Ministers&apos; instructions, been presented to the social services Committee in two interdepartmental reports, one last June,the other in October.     Of the various alternative proposals whichwere made, two possess greater merits than the rest.     These two are summarised in Annex II to this note.11.    In choosing between them Ministers rray think that the fa!lev-ing consideration is of overriding importance.     When studentsregister for employment and do not get it they receive unemployment(CO^FiD^TlAL)
(confidential&quot;benefit if they have a good ojiougL contribution. re corC; o7..&apos;1 if their contribution records are riot good enough and supplementary benefit rates would exceed (as they do now) the vacation element in the student support system, they receive the difference insupplementary benefit.     Under the new system of national insurance contributions which was introduced last April, students will find it increasingly erasy to achieve a good enough contribution recordto be eligible for unemployment benefit in vacations.      If the bulkof the student population is not to be on the unerrploym^nt r^ci^^-^revery vacation, they will have to be made ineligible for both un-employment benefit and supplementary benefit, by legislation.Legislation appears to be inevitable, if only because under thenew system of national insurance contributions which was introducedlast April the present law will result in progressively morestudents qualifying for unemployment benefit.     The legislation could hardly be defended unless the vacation element in the studentsupport system could be shown to compare reasonably well with the single non-householder rate of supplementary benefit while taking account of the fact that students will not normally have establishedwould achieve this; the second would not (nor would any of the others which were devised for presentation to the Social services committee).12.   This feature makes the first option the key to the  15 millionsavings in supplementary benefits to students in 1978-79 which theCabinet decided to include in their savings from the public expend-ture programmes for that year.     The other option does not providethis key, because it produces no extra cash support for thevacations.     It requires instead a potentially extensive hardshipscheme, with its own special staff.13.    If, however, Ministers do not regard removal of students&apos;eligibility for unemployment benefit and supplementary benefit,end the planned saving in the latter, as the overriding objective,the question would arise whether the extra tax raised by p.bolishir:,^child tax allowances should be devoted in whole or in part to anyindependence from their families.The first option in Annex IIs.(CONFIDENTIAL^
other specific objective.      In that event, the Department oi&apos;Education and. Science have indicated that in view of the withdrawalof child tax allowances their first choice of objective would bereplacement of parental contributions by grant; and the Treasu^,/&apos; position is reserved.Objections to abolition of child tax allowances14&quot;.    It is an essential feature of each option that child tax allowances should be withdrawn from parents of students. -   Thiswould not be achieved without damaging the position of somefamilies.     Out of some   million students, some 20,000 do not receive awards from public funds, and their parents would receiveno compensation for the withdrawal of the child tax allowances;nor would these students benefit.     In general, they are studentsover 19 end on low level courses for whom local education author-ities have decided not to give awards.     The parents of students  &quot;in this category might reasonably expect compensation, but sincex   they are outside the awards system there is no way of makingcondensation through that system.     If necessary these studentscould still have access to supplementary benefits in the vacations.Ministers would need to justify this position in the context ofthe tax changes as a whole.HH TreasuryLondon SV12 February 1976
(CGiNriCZ: NTi AL )AHIISX 1TO SUPPLEMENTARY BENEFIT IN THE EASTER VACATION1,     The following arrangement ia designed to prevent studentsfrom registering for employment in the Easter vacation 1976 - as opposed to excluding them from the count of the unemployed.   Itwould involve adapting the &quot;interim scheme&quot; as follows:(a) The Secretary of State for Education and Science would announce that the grant should he regarded as covering theperiod from 1 October to 30 June only; in the long vacationa student would he expected to support himself or, if he were unable to get work he could claim the full supplementary benefit.    (At present his supplementary benefit is reducedby the vacation element in the grant of  3.18 a week).(b) The long vacation element in the current grant for thepresent academic year 1975-76 ( 23) could therefore beregarded as available for students to spend before 30 june and that sum would be paid to all students with awards whoneeded it before the Easter vacation.(c) As the Local Education Authorities are unable to do this,the BursarB of universities or colleges would be asked tomake the payment.    (At universities they already have thetask of handing out instalments of LEA grants each term).(d) The Supplementary Benefit Commission would be advised that students therefore had  i\6 available for use in the easter vacation (the extra  23 plus the  23 already hypo-thecated for that vacation); this would be worth more thanthe equivalent of supplementary benefit:  9.70 a week (fornon-householcers), so that the great majority of studentswould not be eligible for benefit.(c) The Exchequer v/ould luve to finance the extra  23 inthe first place - by making payments direct to everyUniversity, Polytechnic and College of Education and to somecolleges of further education.   But to prevent this from_fCONFIDENTIAL)  _
&quot;being a net addition to public expenditure of same  7 million,local education authorities would have to abate the thirdinstalment of every grant, which is paid at the start of the summer term, by  23 (or by the balance of the grant if that were lower).   As the Exchequer already pays 90$ of thecost of mandatory grants, the extra Exchequer cost would beless than  1 million and would probably be offset by savings on Supplementary Benefit.2.     For the arrangement to succeed, it would require the support and co-operation of(l)   the Vice-Chancellors of Universities and the Principalsof Colleges;(ii)   the Bursar of every University and College;The National Union of Students would have to be informed.   Thenecessary co-operation of the above bodies would have to besecured in the next four weeks so that the extra  23 could bepaid early in March.3.     This short-time table may make it difficult for Bursars topay out the extra  23 in March and the local education authorities will find it difficult to adjust all the grant payments whichthey have to make in April..   But, given the will, the scheme should be manageable.   We think it would be worth pursuing.(iii)the University Grants Committee;(iv)the Local Education Authorities.(confidential)
ANNEX IIThe First Option   (SS(75)itO).     Increase student grants by an amount equal to thevalue of the child tax allowance at the basic rate of tax( 110), thus increasingthe amount of support attributable to 22 weeks of vacation to  180.     Use existing arrangements for local authorities to supplement student grants for those still ingenuine need, in place of existing accesc to the supplementary benefit scheme (whichwould require legislation).The Second Option   (SS(?5)20).     Reduce parental contribution by a standard amount equal to the value of child tax allowance at the basic rate of tax;with (SS(75)l40) a special Student Hardship Scheme - more costly than inthe first option - in replacement of general access to the supplementary benefitscheme (this also requires legislation and a new bureaucracy).The Education Departments see this scheme as an incomplete version of the course...   which they would advocate.     They would add a provision that the-net financialsaving of  1^.9 million under this option should be used to reduce the age atwhich a parental contribution is no longer assumed in awarding grant to a student&quot;v  from 25 to 21.Beside the above options there is also the option of retaining child tax allowance for parents of students.    This would require, however, a separate solution to the supplementary benefit problem, which would presumably have to be the second option*sStudent Hardship Scheme from SS (75)^*

ANNEX III(confide NflAL)THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FIRST OPTIONUnder this proposal all student grants would he increased by  110 a year - that is bythe value of the child tax allowance to a parent paying tax at the basic rate.     Theeffect on parents paying tax at higher rates could, if desired, be adjusted as requiredwithin the parental contribution scale.     The extra  110 would be added to the existingvacation-element in the grant of  ?0 which would provide a total of  180 for students&apos;maintenance during the 22 weeks vacation.    That is equal to the single non-householderrate of supplementary benefit for the short vacation and for 10 of the 14 weeks of thelong vacation and would leave the student to support himself, eg through work for only the remaining four weeks.     Most students would be able to do this but theexisting arrangements for additional help, administered by local authorities, wouldbe extended to assist those in genuine need who had no prospects of getting a Job.This provision, within the student support system, would provide an equitable anddefensible basis for disqualifying those within that system from independent access to supplementary benefit, for which legislation would be required.2.    Because of the extra  110 available from the student grant the problem of genuine hardship in the vacations would be very much reduced and it has been estimatedthat only about  1 million would be required compared with some  20 million under present arrrangements for supplementary benefit.    It is true that this would add to the present workload of local authorities but it would add much less than the*5 million Special Hardship Scheme, to be run by extra Civil Servants, which was theother suggested means of removing students from supplementary benefit in SS(75)ltC.That scheme too would have required legislation,3.    It can be argued that the withdrawal of child tax allowances while leaving theparental contribution scale more or less unchanged might exacerbate the existingproblem of non-payment of those contributions, since parents would have less money available to pay them.    On the other hand the  180 included in student grants underthis option would enable students to contribute to the family budget for their ownmaintenance in the vacations.    The family as a whole would be no worse off than atpresent.     The  110 value of the child tax allowance would merely have been allocated to the student as an identifiable cash provision for his maintenance during thevacation, instead of leaving it vaguely to parental support/earnings, as the basis and justification for removing his present independent right of access to supplementary benefit.    The family would, of course, retain its right of access as a family to supplementary benefit.
