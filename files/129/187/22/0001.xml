CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER IDEFENCE AND DETENTE1,     Ttie Government began a Defence Review in March   1974 to giveeffect to its pledge to achieve savings in defence expenditure of several hundred million pounds per annum over a period, while maintain-ittg a modern and effective defence system.   The 1975 Statement on theDefence Estimates (Cmnd 5976) set out the results of the Review. During I975the basic decisions on the Defence Review have been worked out in greater detail.   The Government has made good progress in putting into effect its policy of concentrating resources on the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), the cornerstone of our security,and of reducing commitments outside the Alliance as far as possible.The Government has also re-examined the support srens of the defence programme, to identify tne additional savings required as part of theInductions ill planned public expenditure&quot; announced in the White Paper onPtiilic Expenditure to 1979/80 (Cmnd 6393).   The 1976 Statement on theDefence Estimates reports on what we have achieved to date.   But -first,it sets our defence policy in context.I EAST/WEST RELATIONS?.    The Government is committed to the search for real and enduringPeace in Europe, and supports NATO as an instrument of detente, no less than of defence.    The Alliance is seeking a safer and more productive relationship with the Soviet Union and the countries of^astern Europe and has made progress in a number of negotiationsfiring the past year, aimed at the creation of genuine and lastingdetente.
0CONFIDENTIAL*HB CONFERENCE ON SECURITY AND CO-OPERATION IN EUROPE3&quot;    The British Government played a major part in the negotiations ofthe Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) and willhonour in full the various undertakings contained in the Final Act(Ctsnd 6198) signed by Heads of State or Government in Helsinki on1 August 1975.   The successful conclusion of the Conference does not mean that the divisions of Europe deriving from the Second World War no longer**ist or have become irrelevant; but it does mark an important stageia the continuous process of a search for detente through better politic-&quot;1 ana military relationships in Europe,   The Final Act of the CSCE**te out an agreed code of behaviour on relationships between all european States.   An essential part of this code is the undertaking toPwait the freer flow of people, ideas, and information and to promote^operation of all kinds between East and West.   There is, of course,Co*petition between the political and social ideas held in differentP&quot;rts of Europe.   But the British Government believes that, if all governments make a real and sustained effort to observe the standards0* behaviour drawn up at Helsinki, then the prospects of achievingCreased co-operation and confidence between East and West, based ontolerance and mutual understanding, will have been valuably and^oibly enhanced.   The thirty five states who participated at the CSCEmeet again in Belgrade in 1977 to review the progress made in^Plementing these and all the other provisions of the Final Act, before^ihg -on to consider further ways of improving security, developingC6*operation, and furthering the process of detente.4&apos;    The Final Act of the CSCE also contained military measures,Signed to promote stability and security by reducing the risks of&quot;^^understanding and miscalculation.   Although not mandatory, theyderive from a firm political decision on the part of all the governments

The measures include the prior notificationW major military manoeuvre exceeding a total of 25,000 troope(including amphibious and airborne troops) independently or combinedHth any possible air or naval components.   For the Soviet Onion and*urkeyf who both hare territory extending beyond Europe, prior**lfteation should be given of manoeuvres taking place in an area*ithin 250 kilometres from their frontiers facing or shared with anyother European participating state.   States may also give prior*tifieation of combined manoeuvres which do not reach a lavel of*%000 troope but which involve land forces together with significant**bers of either amphibious or airborne troops, or both.   Notification*would, whenever poseible, be given 21 days or more before .the^&quot;^oeuvre starts.5-    CSCE participants also recognised that they could contributefurther to confidence and increased security by giving prior notice,** their discretion, of smaller-scale military manoeuvres and of*ior military movements.   The Final Act also provides for observers*0 be invited, voluntarily and on a bilateral basis, to attend*Uitary manoeuvres; participants may aleo, if they wiah, arrangeChanges among military personnel and visits by military delegationsv6*    up to the end of February 1976, NATO countries have notified***** manoeuvres, involving more than 25,000 troops, and five smaller&quot;^oeuvrea; Britiah troops have taken part in four of these.

But this objective     will not be achieved without a moreeven military balance between the two sides than exists a.t present.9*      The Warsaw Pacfs conventional ground forces in Central Europegreatly outnumber those of the West in manpower, and in major equip-ments such as main battle tanks,   NATO cannot accept force reductions which would preserve this imbalance.    Such reductions would do nothing to eliminate this potential source of political instabilityin Europe and could have grave consequences for Western security.The Allies therefore proposed at trie outset that the ground forcemanpower on each side in the area should be reduced to a common level.Such an outcome would be equitable to East and West and would make for a nafer Europe.Throughout the negotiations the Wprsaw Pact countries haveResisted any approach which would have the effect of correcting theimbalance in conventional forces in Central Europe,    In an importantinitiative designed to induce the Warsaw Pact to agree to the WesternApproach, Allied negotiators tabled on 16 December 1975 additionalProposals which included an offer to withdraw a package of Americanhuc3ear weapons from   the reductions area.   We and our Allies believe&quot;that these new proposals, supplementing the West*s earlier proposals,Provide a reasonable basis for reaching an agreement which, whilelowering the level of forces in Central Europe, would ensure undiminishedsecurity for all the countries concerned.   ^update as necessary/7.STRATEGIC ARMS LIMITATION TALKS11*    Following the agreement in principle on the second stage of- 5 -confidential confidential
CONFIDENTIALstrategic arms limitation between President Ford and General SecretaryBrezhnev in Vladivostok in November 1974, the United States and soviet governments have continued their negotiations of the detailed provisionsof a new comprehensive agreement on strategic offensive weapons.   although not participants in the negotiations, the European members of the alliance are concerned with their outcome and are kept informed of progress through consultations with the United Statee in the north atlantic Council.   The British Government looks forward with keeninterest to a successful conclusion of      these       negotiations, sincestrategic stability is essential for the continuance of detents inBaat/Weet relations.OTHER ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT DEVELOPMENTS12.   On 26 March 1975, the Convention oh the Prohibition of Development,Production, and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and ToxinWeapons cane into force.   It is the first agreement since World War IIto result in the destruction of existing weapons by those statespossessing them.   Although the United Kingdom has never possessedbacteriological weapons, the history of this convention shows howconsistent British Governments have been in the search for limitationand reduction of armaments and how large a role Labour Administrationsnave played in these efforts.   Real disarmament measures are onlyachieved by expert study and patient and painstaking multilateralnegotiations.13.   A second important event in 1975 was the Review Conferenceof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).As a depositary power for the treaty the United Kingdom playedan active part throughout the conference.   The fifty eight states- 6 -COMBIIUMtllML
CONPIPEHTIALpresent adopted by consensus a final declaration in which theyreaffirmed their strong common interest in averting further pro-Hf oration of nuclear weapons.   The declaration expressed strong support for the activities of the International Atonic Energy Agency(idea) and recoanended that states who supplied nuclear materials should demand more stringent safeguards on their use.   It emphasised that the idea should flax the central role in relation to the provision of services for the application of nuolsar explosions for peacefulPurposes.   The declaration expressed concern that the nuclear armsrace continued and urged the nuolsar weapon states to take the leadin reaching an early solution to the technical and political difficultieswhich prevented a Comprehensive lest Ban Treaty.   It stressed theImportance of adherence to the NIT as the best means by which non-i,feuclear weapon states could assure each other that they had renouncedBuclear weapons.   The review conference prompted further ratifications*f the treaty, end ninety six states are now full parties.*4.   In June 1975 the United Kingdom took the lead in promoting thetstablishment in the idea of an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on NuclearExplosions for Peaceful Purposes.   The United Kingdom has also suggestedthat the idea should prepare a system of comprehensive fuel-oyeleSafeguards which can be accepted by all non-nuolear weapon states,Whether or not they are party to the Kon-Prolif oration Treaty.*5.   The United Kingdom sent a team of legal, military, and medical**perts to the Conference of Government Experts on conventionaltampons h*ld u&amp;d*r the auspices of the International Committee of*&amp;e Bed Cross in Lugano in January and February 1976.   The conference
CONFIDENTIALwill produce a report on the effects of certain conventionalweapons; this may include recommendations for restrictionson their use.   The report will be discussed in theAd 4oo Committee of the &quot;Diplomatic Conference for the Renffirmation&quot;f Humanitarian Law in Armed Conflict in which the United Kingdom iralso represented,THE WARSAW PACT16,    Although the past year has seen some constructive moves indetente, the West must look realistically at all the facts.   Forexample, since the summer many Eastern commentators have restated&quot;the Soviet view of detente, as being strictly limited toachieving better inter-state- relations, andhave reminded the West that the relaxation ofinternational tension by no means eliminates the struggle o-f idenn .Nor can the West ignore the fact that during the past year theMilitary capability of the Warsaw Pact has increased in numbers ^ndih quality.&quot;*7.   The Soviet Union is deploying new types of intercontinental0R11istic missiles and building more nuclear submarines equipped.with submarine-launched ballistic missiles.    Eleven Delta class nuclear-Powered ballistic missile submarines are now operational and can&quot;threaten all Europe and most of Northern America from Soviet home&quot;taters.   The Soviet Union ie also likely to deploy soon a new medium*ange ballistic missile which will be capable of hitting all the^ior cities in Western Europe.There have also been steady improvements in the conventional forces of the Warsaw Pact.

Warsaw Pact air forces and missile systems are being improved.Soviet tactical air forces are being progressively modernised withvariable geometry aircraft, with a significantly greater radius ofaction and payloed than the aircraft they have replaced.    TheMiG ?3 Flogger is being deployed in increasing numbers in eastern europe, in both ground attack and air defence variants.    The newFencer supersonic multi-role aircraft has recently entered service with the Soviet Tactical Air Armies and the supersonic Backfirebomber has been introduced to the Long Range Air Force,    Increasing&quot;umbers of the fixed wing MiG 73 Foxbat are being deployed in theinterceptor and reconnaissance roles.23.   Soviet aircraft tend to be more widely dispersed than those of nato and the majority of tactical aircraft in Eastern Europe can nowbe protected in shelters.24.    Soviet surface-to-air missile systems have been improved, byModifying older types and by introducing new, mobile, all-weather systems,&quot;thus strengthening the air defence of the homeland and of WarsawSact ground forces on the battlefield.THE WORTH ATLANTIC ALLIANCE25,   Despite the emphasis placed by the Warsaw Pact countries onGilding up their military forces, there is no evidence that theSoviet Union and its allies- are contemplating a military attack upon the West,   Such an attack would not, in present circumstances,
CONFIDENTIALsue coed nor ia It likely that the Soviet Union would contemplatea direct military attack in the future so long as Western countriesmaintain their military vigilance and their political and economic stability.26.   The Russians may. however, be tempted to apply other formsof pressure designed, in particular,   to influence the politicaland economic policies of Western European nations to wean themaway from their alliance with the United States and to make them more susceptible to Soviet influence.   Such a policy couldonly hope to succeed if the West were so gravely weakenedmilitarily, economically, and socially as to have lost itswill to resist.   It must be recognised therefore that the sooialand economic problems now facing the West could, if notsatisfactorily resolved, have consequences for the externalsecurity of Western countries.   Not only is an adequate economiccapability required to enable Western countries to maintainadequate defence forces:   without it, and without the socialstability and political confidence which depend on it. western countries will inevitably find themselves coming under increasing pressure in their external relations with the Warsaw Fact.- 14 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALNATO Strategy27.   The nations of Western Europe anfl North America work together in a range of international organisations, designed to maintain a free, prosperous, and democratic western society.   Among these theNorth Atlantic Alliance is concerned both with the search for detenteand with deterrence, not only of military aggression but also ofthe use of military force as a means of exerting political pressure.In the face of the military threat from the Warsaw Pact, NATO hasevolved the strategy of flexibility in response.   The strategy is a.defensive one: it is designed to deter aggression against   any memberof the Alliance and to defend NATO territory should aggression occur.Two considerations dictate this strategy.   The first is that, sincethe Warsaw Pact is massively armed with nuclear and conventional forceseven much larger conventional forces than NATO now. deploys could not by themselves be guaranteed to deter a Warsaw Pact attack using both nucleana-conventional weapons.   The second is that the Soviet Union now hasstrategic nuclear forces of a size comparable to those of the UnitedStates, and just as capable of surviving a.   first strike .   NATO can*o longer rely for deterrence on its strategic nuclear weapons alone -e, tripwire strategy - since their massive use against the soviet union would evoke similar attacks on Western Europe and on theUnited States.    It is, therefore, NATO&apos;s strategy, if deterrencefaiis, to meet aggression with a defence tailored to the situation,selecting a suitable level of response from a wide range of options^o restore the territorial andmaritime integrity   of the Alliance.The knowledge that NATO has a realistic strategy of this kind isitself an important element in deterrence,- 15 -confidential confidential
CONFIDENTIAL28.   To be able to make an effective and appropriate response toany Warsaw Pact attack, NATO must deploy conventional, theatre nuclear,and strategic nuclear forces.   Each leg of this   triad   of forceshas a specific role in countering particular types of aggression.But none can constitute a credible deterrent unless buttressed bythe other two.29.   NATO*s conventional forces deter, and would defend against,conventional attacks.   They deter because they could repel a limitedincursion upon NATO territory, and because they would provide a stalwartfirst defence against a major conventional attack on Western Europe.A strong conventional defence of the kind which NATO forces offer would keep the nuclear   threshold   high.   At least, it would delay the moment when NATO might need to use nuclear weapons and so maketime for diplomatic attempts to end the conflict.    At best, it woulddemonstrate to the enemy that he had under estimated NATO?s resolve,and cause him to withdraw,30.    Theatre nuclear forces are indispensable to NATO for two reasons.pirat, they deter the Warsaw Pact from using its own theatre nuclearforces.    Secondly, they represent a link between not*s conventionaland strategic nuclear forces, and they increase the range of optionsopen to the Alliance should its conventional defence prove inadequate.Without such weapons NATO might be faced with the choice of accepting^e annexation of part of its territory or of initiating strategic nuclear war.31 .   Strategic nuclear forces constitute the ultimate deterrent.Without then not*s other forces would not present a credible deterrent
CONFIDENTIALto the Warsaw Pact, with its strategic nuclear arsenal.    Thus theyhelp to deter attack at any level, and would also deter attempts to escalate a conflict should one begin.32.    But the possession of nuclear weapons is not in itself sufficientto ensure deterrence.    It must be made evident to a potential enemythat we would be prepared to use them if we had to.   Therefore, anan essential part of its defensive strategy, NATO has developedplans and procedures for the use of nuclear weapons.    These areregularly reviewed by Ministers in the Nuclear Planning Group (NPG).NATO*s forces are trained to use nuclear:-weapons tactically, ifnecessary, against an enemy who does not conceal his readiness todo the same.    At the strategic level, recent changes in Americantargeting   policy give the President a more flexible range ofretaliatory options against Warsaw Pact military targets, therebymaking the threat of NATO retaliation more credible than if the onlyoption available wareto strike cities,    NATO can, therefore, useits nuclear weapons in a controlled and effective way.   Deterrencebecomes more credible and as a consequence it is less likely that,NATO would ever have to use nuclear weapons at all,3.3.    This strategy and these forces not only deter aggression againstWestern Europe;-they also protect membersof the Alliance from attempts at coercion by the threat of attack,and from other forms of direct and indirect political pressure de-riving from military power.    In this way, the Alliance preserves for of its membern the right to pursue their own destiny,

CONFIDENTIALPolitical Structure of NATO34,   The implementation of the strategy of flexibility in responseis under political control.   Regular meetings of the North atlantic council and of the Defence Planning Committee are held at ForeignMinister and Defence Minister level respectively;   in May 1975a special NATO Summit of Heads of State or Government was held.At this summit the Allied leaders reaffirmed their determination tomaintain the cohesion of the Alliance, and achieve its prime purposeof ensuring the independence and security of its members throughlasting peace,35,   NATO&apos;a Military Authorities are responsible to tie defence planning Committee, which in 1975 met in Ministerial Session in Mayand December,    In May, Ministers laid down guidelines for all defence planning activities in NATO up to 198? and beyond.   These guidelinesrestate the basic aims and strategy of   the Alliance and place specialemphasis on long-range.aspects of defence policy.   They stress theneed for optimum use of resources through rationalisation, standard-i sat ion, and greater co-operation.   Ministers set work in hand forfurther efforts towards rationalisation of functions andstandardisation of equipments.    It was also agreed to pursue withinthe Alliance as a whole the proposal, first put forward in the Kuro-groun, to establish a &quot;two-way street&quot; in defence procurement betweenSurope and North America.   This proposal, aimed at making moreaffective use of the resources that the members of NATO devote to defence)should also help to increase standardisation of equipmentend achieve a more equitable balance of trade in defence equipment- 19-WfiWAAL
CONFIDENTIALbetween Europe and North America.     In December the North atlantic council in Ministerial session agreed to form an ad hoc committee under trie Council to prepare a specific programme of action covering the interoperability of military equipment.   Ministers also took note of the military case for an Airborne Early Warning and control system and agreed to consider at their Spring 197* meeting whether toacquire such a system.36,   As a permanent member of the NHf the United Kingdom plays afull part in its activities.   At their twice-yearly meetings,Ministers of the NPG have reviewed the balance of strategic nuclearforces between the Soviet Union and the United States,   A com-prehensive work programme dealing with the possible defensive tacticaluse of nuclear weapons by the Alliance is being completed; thequestion of how best to harness recent technological developments in support of NAIO*s deterrent posture and conventional and nuclearcapabilities ia being studied.The Eurogroup37,   The Government attaches particular importance to improvingdefence co-operation among our European Allies, especially inequipment procurement, to make the best use of available resources and to increase military efficiency through greater standardisation.38.   The Eurogroup, of which the British Secretary of State for defence was Chairman in T975* provides a valuable forum for promotingco-operation among the European Allies.   The Secretary of State hasnow handed over the chairmanship to Mr Vanden Boeynants of Belgium.During the past year real progress has been made towards greater- so -^TTOnFTMSfrrfcL
CONFIDENTIALEuropean defence co-operation; the United Kingdom will continue toplay a major role in the Eurogroup and seek to secure even greater co-operation in future,39,   Standardisation of equipment, with the military and financialbenefits that it confers, can best be achieved if countries firstform common ideas of how they intend their forces to operate and agree on the tasks for which they would need equipment.    Once agree-ment is reached on these tactical concepts, agreement on common types of equipment should follow more easily.   The sub-group Burolongterm,which is responsible for developing and harmonising tactical concepts,has made good progress.   As a result of its efforts Ministers haveendorsed tactical sub-concepts on anti-armour, and on mobilityand counter-mobility, designed to promote greater standardisation of equipment in these areas in the longer term.   The Burotraining sub-group has initiated a number of collaborative training projects withthe ultimate aim of having one or two nations provide all thetraining required in any one subject for the other nations.    This isintended to reduce costs, to improve co-operation and mutual under-standing,and to hasten the process of standardisation.   The EurogroupMinisters have also signed principles of co-operation for logisticswhich should lead to greater practical co-operation in future.    Theyhave welcomed the signature by three Eurogroup countries, includingthe United Kingdom, of a Memorandum of Understanding about co-operation in logistic support for marine gas turbine engines.40.    Important progress has been made on the proposal in 1974 thatthe European members of the Alliance should strengthen their own
CONFIDENTIALarrangement a for equipment collaboration as a basis for NATO-widecollaboration, and should evolve a rational policy towards the procur e-ment of defence equipment from the United States.   At a special meetingof the Eurogroup on 5 November and at their regular meeting on8 December, Ministers discussed in detail the questions of standard-i sat ion, European equipment collaboration, and co-operation betweenEurope and North America in defence procurement.   They decided to propose discussions with the United States and Canada to find specificways of increasing transatlantic co-operation and the reciprocalpurchasing of defenoe equipment, thus putting traffic on ths &quot;two-way street&quot;.   They agreed that fresh emphasis needed to be placed onstandardisation of complete major equipments, weapons systems,assemblies, and components.European Equipment Collaboration41.   Ministers also recognised the importance of pursuing work on european collaboration in defence equipment procurement in a forumin which all European members of the Alliance could participate.They therefore proposed the establishment of an independent Europeanprogramme group to explore the potential for extending co-operationamong European countries in the production of defence equipment and for co-ordinating the European end of a transatlantic &quot;two-waystreet&quot;.   At the meeting in Rome on 2 February representatives fromthe major European countries of the Alliance, including France,agreed to establish this group.   The group will work towards harmon-ising national equipment schedules, agreeing on joint projects, andeliminating duplication of development efforts; further meetingswill take place during 1976.   Italy will take the chair for thefirst year.CONFl0fcl??!AL

CONFIDENTIALBRITAIN&apos;S CONTRIBUTION TO NATO42.   Almost the whole of Britain&apos;8 defence effort is now devoted tosupporting NATO&apos;s strategy,   Britaln&apos;s contribution to the Allianceconsists of professional volunteer forces of the highest efficiency and dedication, equipped with modern weapons and ready for immediate and stalwart defence.   At sea, Britain provides the major contribution   -some 70 per cent of not*s immediately available maritime forces - to thedefence of the Eastern Atlantic and Channel areas, and to the securityof the sea-borne supply and reinforcement routes from North america to Europe.   On the mainland of Europe, in accordance with ourBrussels Treaty obligations, we maintain land forces totalling55,000 men and tactical aircraft for the Second Allied Tactical Air*orce.   These forces hold a crucial sector of the Central Front on*he North German plain and are committed to the forward defence strategyQf the Alliance.   In the United Kingdom, the main tasks of our armed forces are to reinforce the mainland of Europe and to ensure thesecurity of the home base, whose defence is not only of the highest importance of itaelf but which is invaluable alao to NATO as a base*nd as a staging point for reinforcement forces from the United States.pinally, Britain is the only European NATO ally to make a contributionto HAT0&apos;3 strategic nuclear deterrent capability, by means of theSolaris force.   The effectiveness of this force will be maintained.43*   In support of these commitments, major force improvements madesince last year or planned to enter service in the coming year includet-a.     Royal Navy(i) HMS Superb, the third Swiftsure classsubmarine;(ii) four more Type 21 frigates;- 26 -confidential confidential
(iii) the second Type 42 guided-missiledestroyer;(iv) the Lynx helicopter;p.     Army(i) Lance tactical missile system;(ii) the Striker tracted vehicle to carry theSwingfire anti-tank missile already in service on other vehicles;(iii) laser sight for Chieftain tanks, and laserrange finder for artillery observation posts;(iv) armoured bridge-laying and recovery vehiclebased on the Chieftain tank.c.     Royal Air Force(i) six more Jaguar squadronsmaking eight squadrons in all, and enabling morePhantom PGR2s to be transferred to the air defencerole;(ii) a second UK-based Buccaneer squadron;(iii) completion of the re-equipment of the tanker force with the improved Victor k3 aircraft;(iv) a three-year programme for refitting Nimrodmaritime patrol aircraft with improved radio and communications equipment.44.,   During the course of the Defence Review, our Allies welcomed the assurance that the British commitment to NATO remains the first and over-riding priority, but in the course of consultations they asked theGovernment to study the possibility of undertaking certain additional measures within the overall budget limits.   Five such measures were*Agreed and announced last year and involved no extra costs.   Four- 27 -CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALadditional measures have been formally offered to NATO.   They wouldmake a worthwhile addition to NATOfs defences on the flanks.   Theircosts, which are modest in relation to the benefits, can be accomodated within the Defence Budget by making adjustments elsewhere.45.   The four additional compensatory measures are:-a.     Allocation of two additional commando groups together with a brigade headquarters and a logistic regiment for deploy-ment in support of specific NATO plans.   One of these groups with a small tactical brigade headquarters wouldbe trained and equipped for operations in Norway in winter.bA    The maintenance of an option to deploy a land force to North East Italy, by using part of the 6th Field Force(the land element to be derived from the United KingdomMobile Force) together with helicopter support.c. Temporary air training deployments to Allied air-fields in the Southern Region in peacetime, thus continuingour present frequency of training detachments.d. Retention of the option to deploy two offensivesupport squadrons to North East Italy, in support of the fifth Allied Tactical Air Force, in the counter-air,interdiction, and close support roles.NATO FORCE IMPROVEMENTS46,   NATO members have not been idle in taking measures aimed at off-- 28 -confidential confidential
setting the increasing military capability of the Warsaw Fact described above by improving the quality and effectiveness of their forces andequipment.   At the December 1975 Ministerial meetings of the Eurogroupand the Defence Planning Committee, Defence Ministers noted measures that are now being taken or are planned to this end.    Equipmentmeasures include improvement in anti-armour capabilities, air defence and aircraft protection, modernisation and replacement of ships, the procurement of new aircraft by several European nations,  and there-equipment and modernisation of the Canadian Forces.   On the manpowerside, Ministers noted the progress made by the United States informing two new combat brigades in Europe from within existing manpower and the increased effectiveness of the German armed forces resultingfrom the formation of three new brigades, again from within existingmanpower levels.THE ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL FRAMEWORK47-    The 1974 Defence Review was governed by military as well aseconomic   criteria; while reducing expenditure by several hundredmillion pounds per annum over a period, it was essential to maintain a modern and effective defence system.   Our existing commitments and capabilities were subjected to close scrutiny, and aa the preceding section has shown, Britain&apos;s defence effort is now concentrated onNATO, though with due regard to our responsibilities for our remainingdependent territories.48.   The Government continues to accord these commitments the highest priority and is determined to provide those levels of forces whichthe Defence Review showed were needed to fulfil them adequately.   This- 29 -CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmoans that the front-line units allocated to these commitments, andtheir direct support, must have the first call on the available resources.49.   The Governmenfs strategy for managing public expenditure wasBet mut In the White Paper &quot;Public Expenditure to 1979/80** (Cmnd 6393)*If the United Kingdom is to overcome its economic problems,the levelof resources taken by public expenditure programmes, excluding debt interest, must be stabilised at ths level planned for 1976/77 inorder to provide the sesources needed for investment and the balanceof payments.   To achieve this objective, substantial economies willhave to be made in the planned programmes published in the White Paper&quot;Riblie Expenditure to 1978/79&quot; (Cmnd 5879).   The total reductions in public expenditure programmes amount at 1975 Survey prices toeone  1,600million in 1977/78 and  3,OOOmilllon in 1978/79.   taking account of increases on certain programmes, largely in support ofIndustrial regeneration, the net reductions are about  1,000million*&quot;d  2,A00million respectively.50.   Substantial reductions have had to be made in many programmes^defence had to play its part in ensuring the success of the economic*trategy.   The ret nave, however, been no changes in ths political andmilitary relationships between the Alliance and the Warsaw Pact sinesta* Defence Review which would justify a reassessment of our essentialcommitments.   It follows that the levels of front-line forces andtheir direct support, whioh tho Defence Review showsd were required*o carry out those commitments, must remain generally as planned.   This**e meant that the further economies in ths defense budget for whichthe review of public expenditure calls have been sought very largelythose areas of the support structure which are not directly and immediately in support of front-line units, and in which the Defence5,Jview laft soope for further detailed studies.   This search hasb*en successful and therefore the Government has decided to make- 30 -c   WQI Unt^ Kl
CONFIDENTIALreductions in the defence budget, at 1975 Survey prices.of  177 Million in 1977A8, of  193 million in 1978/79. and of 164 million in 1979/80, compared with the plans set out in the 1975Statement on the Defence Estimates.51.   Some savings nave been found from negotiations with the Governmentof Hong Kong for a substantial increase in their contribution towardsthe cost of the garrison there.   But it will be necessary to make aconsiderable number of cuts in the support areas.   A number of depots&quot;111 be closed; there will be cuts in the works, fuel, and clothingprogrammes; minor reductions will be made in the equipment programme;savings will be made in the research and development programme,Qainly by speeding up the rationalisation of establishments and byeconomy in extra-mural research; and substantial reductions will be madeIn the civilian staff in headquarters and elsewhere. While every effort willbe mads to avoid redundancies there will inevitably be some, if a reduc-tion of about 10,000   civilian jobs is to be made; there will alsobe a loss of some   3,000   job opportunities in the defence industries.52. These savings will be concentrated upon those**eas of support which are not directly associated with front-line*mts.The framework of thefuture defence programme remains unchanged; the front line contributionto NATO has not been reduced; the major re-equipment programmes willcontinue; and the level of direct support for our front-line capabilityhas not been cut.   Our NATO allies were informed, after the publicationof the White Paper on Public Expenditure to 1979/80, of the kind of measures which would need to be taken to meet the revised budgetarytargets.
CONFIDENTIALTMTT.TafTmTTATION OP THE DEFENCE REVIEWNON-NATO CCMNITMENTS,53.   During 1975, consultations and negotiations have taken place onthe decisions to reduce our non-NATO commitments or to eeek increases in contributions towards their costs.   At the time of tne defence review, the Hong Kong force level consisted of five infantry battalions,artillery regiment and an armoured reconnaissance squadron, twoengineer squadrons, one frigate, five Naval patrol craft, and an RAF^Ucopter squadron.   The garrieon will be reduced in 1976 to four inftntrybattalions (three of them Gurkha battalions), an engineer squadron,five Naval patrol craft, and an BAF helicopter squadron.   Under theterns of a new cost sharing agreement to come into effect on 1 April 1976*as.a on this reduced garrison, the Hong Kong Government will pay anCreased share of the cost of the garrison, rising from 50 per cent in1976/77 to 62* per cent in 1977/76 and to.75 per cent thereafter. This con-t*distribution will be adjusted to reflect movements in prices. The agreement,^ch also provides for the release of Service-occupied land for civil use,*m run for seven years in the first instance, and will be renewed*** subsequent periods of five yeare on the same terms unices either^ernment wishes to vary them.Consultations with the Sultan of Brunei are continuing abouttat timing of the withdrawal of the Gurkha battalion;   a formal reviewof the 1959 Agreement with Brunei, as amended in 1971, has begun.The withdrawal of forces from the Far East and the Indian0eean ia proceeding according to plan.   By the end of March, thenthdrawal from Gan, Mauritius, and Singapore will be complete.
CONFIDENTIALFollowing discussion with the South. African Government, the SimonstownAgreements have been ended by an exchange of letters.   The SeniorBevel Officer West Indies will have been withdrawn by the end ofKerch, and HH ships will no longer be permanently stationed there.56.   An agreement covering American plans for the expansion of theirfacility at Diego Garcia was signed, and laid before Parliament^ on26 February.57.   Personnel loaned from the three Services continued throughout1975 to support the Sultan of Oman in his oampaign against the rebelsin Dhofar.   Progress in earlier phases of the campaign and in thedevelopment of the Sultan&apos;s Armed Forces enabled us to withdraw in^he first half of 1975 the Army and RAF Regiment detachments helping to defend Salalah airfield.   More reductions will follow towards the*hd of 1976 as the RAF detachment at Salalah hands over itsresponsibility for the operation of the airfield there.58.   in the autumn of 1975 the majority of the remaining rebels inDhofar and the foreign troops supporting them withdrew to the People *sdemocratic Republic of Yemen because they were in danger of being&quot;Urrounded.   The rebellion in Dhofar was then virtually brought to*n end, although a fow scattered groups of rebels are still active.The scope for reductions in the level of our remaining military assist-*advance to Oman will be kept under review;   as many of our Servicemen*re training Omanis to take over the tasks at present being carriedottt by expatriates, this must bs a gradual process.59.

tCONFIDENTIALE97IBIENT AND FORCE COMPOSITION60*   Although the recent Expenditure Review involved some adjustments to the overall figures for planned future equipment expenditure setout in the   1975  Statement on the Defenoe Estimates (Chapter Iparagraphs 61-63)* ths general pattern remains valid: a slow and limited growth in equipment spending, which we nevertheless stillexpect to talcs a somewhat higher proportion of the overall defence budget; and a roughly stable research and development effort, coupled with increased emphasis on international co-operation.61.   The changes in the force composition and equipment of theServices, after the Defence Review, are related to reductions incommitments on the flanks of NATO and outside the Alliance; details are given below.   The command structures for each of the Services,following the Defence Review, are shown in figures 6, 7, and 8.62.   in view of the nature of the Soviet maritime threat it wasdecided in the Defenoe Review to maintain ths core of ths Navy*santi-submarine forcesi the cruiser and nuclear-powered Fleet sub-marine programmes.   These forces will, be strengthened by the conversionof RMS Hermes to ths anti-submarine role this year.   However, theDefence Review decisions involved reductions in the planned numbersof destroyers, frigates, and mine counter-measuree vessels (MCMVs),accounted for by the cut in our oversea and Mediterranean commitments,end in conventional submarines, with consequential reductions in*float support and auxiliary craft.   These reductions are being*mde partly by adjustments to construction programmes, and partly- 37 -confidential confidential fi

Considerablettrther savings have been made by decisions to reduce, defer, orQ*hcel plans for the introduction of over AO relatively low pricedItems of equipment in the Army&apos;a general programme.

The size of the support helicopter force has beenreduced, partly by disbanding the Wessex squadron in Singapore.   the timing of further reductions in support helicopters, and of thereduction in the size of the maritime patrol force, is related tooar continuing commitments in the Mediterranean and the eventualwithdrawal from Malta.ORGANISATIONAL CHANGES&amp;Offress on Amy Reorganisation65.   Plans for putting into effect the reorganisation of the ArmyOh the lines set out in the   1975  Statement on the Defence Estimatesbfcve been drawn up and issued.   Trials and evaluation of the resultscontinue and adjustments and refinements will be made where necessarywithin the overall concept.   The proposed command structure for the reorganised Army is shown at figure 7. The Army plans to achieve atotal reduction of some 15,600 military personnel (includingtOoo Gurkhas) by the end of the decade.   The effect of the reorganis-*tion on our combat forces is dealt with in Chapter II.As part of the Army*s efforts to ensure that the &quot;teeth&quot; to&quot;tail&quot; ratio is improved, a major review has been made of the Army*supply and repair systems end facilities, aimed at achieving more*oonomic concepts and the concentration, wherever possible, of its existing resources.   The review has led to proposals for the creationof a more taut and unified management structure - the Logisticfcfcecutivs (Army) - to be established at the former RAP station at- 39 -
CONFIDENTIALBicester.   Proposals for extensive restructuring of static logisticfacilities in the United Kingdom are also envisaged.   Further details are given in Chapter VII paragraphs 8-10.Boval Haw and Army Use of Royal Air Force Stations67.   The Royal Navy and the Army have completed the first stages of a detailed examination to decide how they might use the twelve airfields and stations which the Royal Air Force decided to vacate over the next three years as a result of the Defence Review.   The Royal Navy is considering taking over Thorney Island as a more economical alternative to a planned rebuilding at Lee-on-Solent.   The RAF will retain asizeable enclave at West Raynham.   The future use of Biggin Hill hasm to be determined.   In the early Autumn of 1975 the government announced that the Army proposed to take over the nine remainingstations (Bicester, Chessington, Colerne, Driffield, Hullavington,Leconfield, Little Rissington, Medmenham and Tern Hill) and alsoSpitalgate and Debden, whose closure was announced earlier.   Alsoduring 1975 the Army took over vacant stations at Oust on and Oakington.Acquisition of these RAF stations will enable the Army toVacate a number of nutted camps and other lees satisfactory aoeommoda-tion in the United Kingdom, achieving a significant and earlierimprovement in the living standards of many soldiers than would other-*lae have been possible.   The cost of rebuilding and rehabilitation*t existing locations would have been of the order of  80 million;hnt the immediate costs of moving into the airfields will be much lessthan this figure, although substantial expenditure on improvements*ill be required in the long term.   The Army School of Transport can- 40 -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALnow be centralised at Leconfield and Driffield, so that the major partof the Army*s &apos;B&apos; vehicle driver training can be concentrated in one place without heavy cost.   This should lead to increased efficiency in training while at the same time reducing overheads.RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT69.   ^Eftsr consultation with staff and trades union representatives,the framework of the second stags of the rationalisation of research anddevelopment (R ft D) establishments has been decided.   Together with.thefirst stage, the measures will complete a research and development organisation based on four systems establishments - sea, land, air,-andunder-water - supported by a number of technology establishments.?0.   The second stage of the rationalisation will involve ths establish-Bent of a Marine Technology Establishment at Haslar, and a marine engineering wing at Pyestock.   This will enable several   sites to be closed and work to be concentrated at Haslar and Pyestock.   A similarconcentration of activities in ths field of explosives will enableeeveral sites to be closed and their work to be carried out at the atomic Weapons Research Establishment, Aldermaaton, and at the RoyalArmament Research and Development Establishment, Fort Halstead/. further details are given in paragraph 86.INDUSTRIAL AND EMPLOYMENT IMPLICATIONS.   The Defence Review resulted in a large reduction in the equipment programme from the previous planned expenditure levels - some ^Figure*e be inserted/ over ten years at 1975 Survey prices.   The number ofjob opportunities in the defence industries in future years will not therefore increase to ths extent that previous plans envisaged.?2*   A 4&amp; per cent reduction in dockyard industrial numbers has taken place- k1 -CQWFIJENJIAL.

The future manpower levelwill be kept under close review in relation to the requirements forship re-fitting and repair and the scope for using economicallyany spars capacity for other tasks.   There is no prospect however ofsignificant spare capacity becoming available in the foreseeable future.73.   The present prospect for the Royal Ordnance Factories (ROFs)is that a growing workload for overseas customers should more thancompensate for changes in the Servicesequipment programmes resultingfrom the Defence Review.74.   The major contractors affected by the Defence Review were consulted about its implications for them, and the representativesof their workforces were given the opportunity to comment; account has been taken of the views expressed.   For example, followingrepresentations from both management and trades unions of hawker siddeley Aviation, adjustments were made in the planning of reducedProgrammes on Victor tanker, Nlmrod, and Argosy aircraft.     more recently there has been close consultation with the management andWorkforce of Hawker Siddeley Dynamics following the   Government*decision not to proceed with the development of the Sub-J!artela&amp;ti-ship missile system.IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EXPENDITURE REVIEW75.   The reduction in the defence programme, identified in para-Kfaph 50 above as part of the public expenditure review, will be concentrated on support, research, and civilian staffs, in orderto preserve the front line capabilities of the Services.   further details on the measures to be taken are set out below.- U2 -CONFIDENTIAL

These will include the armament depots at Antrim and Bandeath, the oil fueldepot at Lyness and the minor depots at Llanion and Llanreath, whioh form part of the oil fuel depot at Pembroke Dock; all these will be closed by1 April 1978.   The floyal Naval Aircraft Yard at Wroughton will also be closed and its work transferred to other yards with consequent savings in*taff.

This change will be directed mainly at support of sales*nd naval establishments and will not affect ship work in the dookyard.?7.   There will also be some reduction in naval fuel and stockPurchases, in port services, and in afloat support.   In the dockyards,there will be some rephaslng of the proposed changes in managementBystems.

Aa a direct result of the reductionin aircraft numbers decided on during the 1974 Defence Review, therewill be a substantial overall decrease in the amount of aircraftengineering work available to RAF Support Command and industry.   Itwill not be possible, in these circumstances, to maintain the present level of employment or to retain all the existing aircraft engineeringunits in Support Command.

The Defence Review had major 0onsequences for the level of^activity in the defence industries.   The measures outlined above are concentrated on support for the Services and will not have a significant effect on industry;   there will be a loss of aboutf;3000 job opportunities but no major plants will have to be closed.

The Headquarters and Jet Provost element ofthe Central Plying School (CPS) will move from RAP Little Rlssington jto RAP College Cranwell in the spring when the Gnat and Bulldog !elements will move to RAF Valley and 4AF Learning respectively.   Thehelicopter element of CFS now at RAF Tern Hill will move to RAFShawbury in the autumn.   Little Kissing ton and Tern Rill will closeas RAF stations.MROA Operational Training19.   The RAF, German Air Force, German Navy,and Italian Air- 11? -CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALForce have studied tbe feasibility of carrying out tbeoperational training of HRCA aircrews on a collaborativebasis.   Consultation is continuing with the aim of setting uptwo tri-national training units, an Operational Conversion Unit-at HAP Cottesnore in the United Kingdom,and a Weapons Conversion Unitat Decimomannu in Sardinia.   Aircraft, Instructors, and student crewsWould be provided by the three nations and formed into fully integratedtraining units.   The Introduction of this training pattern will bea significant step forward on the path to increased co-operation in the alliance       and will produce not only Increased operational effective-ness but also financial savings for the partner nations.JOINT TRAININGTrl-service TrainingSO.   Studies are continuing Into the possibility of further tri-service training in specific areas.   To ensure that full advantageis taken of the opportunities for Joint training, an Independentinquiry Is being undertaken by Mr E R L Lewis, Chief TrainingConsultant to the Training Services Agency of the Manpower services commission.Adventurous Training21,   All three Services have undertaken an extensive programme ofMventurous Training.COMMONWEALTH AND FOREIGN TRAINING22,   During 1975 about 7500 officers and men from some 70Commonwealth and foreign countries attended training courses Inthe United Kingdom.   The Services also continued to provide personnel to help other countries with local training.

Details of the main changesaffecting support are given in Chapter I paragraphs 76-81.ttOYAL NAVY MAINTENANCE AMD SUPPLY ORGANISATIONRoyal Dockyards2.     There is a full load of naval work for the four home dockyards fortneforeseeable future and an assured naval requirement for their capacity,since no other capability exists for the major part of the shipwork load.3.     Guided missile destroyer tasks will be concentrated at portsmouth.    Ships to be refitted there will include HMS Kent   andM Bristol, as well as HMS Blake and some patrol submarines.    Therefitting and refuelling of nuclear submarines will be the majortasks of Rosyth and Chatham.   Rosyth will be undertaking the secondnajor refits of the Polaris submarines, HLIS Resolution andHMS Repulse, while Chatham will be refitting the Fleet submarines883 Conqueror and HMS Courageous.   Both Rosyth and Chatham will alsoundertake major work on surface ships, including frigate refits.HKS Londonderry will be converted at Rosyth to a trials ship.   &apos;iheaajor share of Leander class frigate refits will be carried out at^evonport where the programme will also include the refits ofArk Royal and HMS Hermes and dockings of nuclear submarines,^vonport will also be completing the refits of two destroyers of*he Imperial Iranian Navy.   All aockyards will undertake work on a variety of other vessels anfl craft.*     A new wages structure for the Royal Dockyard wnn introduced at Chatham on 1 July 1975 for a trial period of oneyear.   Under tnefcew arrangements all systems of payments by results have been withdrawn- 120 -CONFIDENTIAL
confidential and replaced by a flat rate supplement of 20% of the basic ratepayable to all dockyard industrial employees; productivity agreementsremain in operation. The new system of payment is aimed at improvingdockyard efficiency by means designed to achieve a common rather than an individual z*eaponae. The extension of the scheme to the other homedockyards will be considered when the outcome of the trial at Chathamis known.5*    Other changes aimed at improving efficiency include reconstitutingthe Royal Dockyards Policy Board, improvements in management related to the new wages structure, and the separate Dockyard Vote - Vote 12 -which has been introduced into the Defenoe Estimates for 1976/77.The Vote brings together from a number of different Votes the main elements of provision for running the dockyards.Naval Aircraft Repair Organisation (NAflO)6.    The assumption of responsibility by the Royal Air Force forrepairing naval fixed wing aircraft, and by the Royal Navy forrepairing the helicopters of all three Services, lias now been completedsatisfactorily and the benefits are beginning to be realised,   inaddition tbe NARO is now equipped to undertake the repair of marinegas turbine engines for the Fleet.Royal Navy Supply and Transport Services (RNSTS)7.    Following wide-ranging consultancy studies, RUSTS storage andassociated facilities in naval bases in the united Kingdom are being examined with the aim of achieving improvements in both efficiency and economy.   &quot;&quot;Limited oil and berthing facilities are being main-tained In Singapore to support visits by ships of the Royal navy and our allies^.
confidentialconfidentialARMY SUPPORT ORGANISATIONLatic   Su]8*      In accordance with the decisions on the reorganisation of the*rey announced in the 1975 Statement on the Defence Estimates, the Armyhaa carried   out     a major review of its logistic organisation,Wens, and facilities in the United Kingdom and overseas.   The aimbeen to cut ths cost of support as far as possible without detrimentthe Army&apos;s opsrational capability.   This review has led to a major*** proposal for the establishment of an integrated logistic commandcontrol organisation - ths logistic Executive - to be introduced in late 1976 and located with other major Amy logistic facilities** the former RAP Station at Bicester.9-    The studies have also indicated that substantial reduction and^hoentration of facilities will be needed in Army storeholding and repair installations in ths Unitsd Kingdom.   Proposals derived fromthese studies are currently under discussion with the Department&apos;s stafftoterests.   The proposals envisage   a&quot;reduction in the present number or *ajor storeholding depots in the United Kingdom, the closure of a&quot;*ln repair facility, and the elosure or re-roling, throughout thecountry, of a number of smaller logistio establishments concernedwith a variety of local support tasks for Regular Army and TAVR units.10-   Those proposals would, if implemented, entail a heavy net****etion of some 3,000 (10 per cent) in the number of civilians employed0* Army logistics in the United Kingdom over the next few yearsiWans are in hand to achieve a somewhat heavier proportionateAuction in locally employed civilians abroad in the Army logisticarea.- 122 -CONFIDENTIAL

It has been decided to reduce the number of^ited Kingdom commands from three to two, and proposals to mergeSuPPOrt and Training Commands by mid-1977, with a single commandheadquarters at RAF Brampton, have recently been announced.^*   The organisation of ground radio engineering tasks is to bs**tionalised with the aim of establishing an integrated Ground Radio^eiheering Support Unit; details are still under discussion.   SupportCommand Signals Headquarters and the Radio Introduction Unit willtransfer from RAF Medmenham to RAF Benson by early 1977-15*   As a direct consequence of the reduction in aircraft engineeringwork referred to In Chapter I paragraph 79 the RAF maintenance**hita at Aldergrove and Sydenham in Northern Ireland will be closedby 1 April 1978.    In addition, two separate aircraft engineering taskswill be brought together at RAF Abingdon, following the move of No. 60^intenance Unit from RAF Leconfield and No. 71 Maintenance Unit from*** Bicestsr.
CONFIDENTIAL16.   Further savings will arise from the transfer of storage tasksfrom No. 2$ Maintenance Unit RAF Har tie bury to No. 1^ Maintenance UnitRAF Carlisle and No. 16 Maintenance Unit at RAF Stafford, which willenable Hartlebury to be closed In 1977.   To permit more efficientstorage and handling of stores which are in frequent demand, and toreduce labour and transport costs, a special facility is currently being constructed at the storage depot at RAF Stafford and is due tobe completed by December 1976.17.   Within the last twelve months the Royal Air Force has thoroughlyreviewed its main United Kingdom road transport systems; significanteconomies have been achieved without detriment to operational require-raents.Aircraft Maintenance and Repair1B.   After the Defence Review the RAF policy for maintenance and repair of aircraft was reassessed in detail.   The Royal Air force will continue to carry out all maintenance of front line aircraft,up to and Including major servicing,and will allocate to industrymajor modification and deep repair work^which necessitates speoialtools and equipment which it would be uneconomic to provide in service establishments.19.   The major servicing and repair of training, communication, and miscellaneous aircraft will be divided between RAF units and industry0h the basis of the relative loading of industry and Service units andthe comparative costs.Collaborative Logistics20.   The arrangements for the inter-dependent logistics support ofthe Jaguar for the British and French Air Forces have been put IntoPractice and are running smoothly.   Tripartite planning for the support0f the MRCA is continuing.
KNBRfiY CONSERVATION21*..   Energy consumption by the Department in the United Kingdom was over10 per cent leas in the year ending March 197S than in 1972/73, a savingequivalent to more than 350,000 tons of oil. This was the result of closeVigilance and control at all management levels coupled with someAuctions in levels of activity.   The Services and their support-organisations are also participating fully In the national &quot;Save^t&quot; campaign run by the Department of Energy end, in conjunction**th the Property Services Agency as appropriate, are investing in- 125 -CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIALINTER-SERVICE CO-ORDINATION OP SUPPORT21.   The identification and examination of further areas for theNationalization of supply and engineering support between the Servicescontinues to receive close attention, and current procedures for^tionaliaation of support remain under constant review.22.   \7ork is continuing on the tri-Service project aimed at achievingcompatibility between the next generation of supply ADP systems due*0 come into operation over the period from late 1978 to the early 1980s.the   project   has    involved developing the rules to enable standardterminology and data to be used at the interfaces between supply and^elated systems,&apos; this will make supply more effective by*.habling inter-Service transactions to be carried out withouttranslation.The Directorate of Standardization continues to contribute to defence economies by reducing the variety of items in the defenceShventory.    It is also involved in a NATO review of the standardization0f assemblies, components, spare parts, and materials.

Following the acceptance of the majority of the reconmeralations of theDefence Lands Committee as noted in last year*s Statement on the DefenceRstimetes, action has been continued to implement, so far as financial con-etraints permit, both those recommendations of a general nature andthose concerning individual sites.   In particular there have-been veryconsiderable improvements in access by the public to the LulworthRanges, culminating in the official opening of new footpaths on September 1975.26,   tn November 1975 a non-statutory Public Inquiry conductor byBaroness Sharp of Hornsey opened at Exeter to consider whether theServices&quot;training needs on Dartmoor could, subject to certain conditions, be met elsewhere.   The Inquiry is not yet complete.WORKS SERVICES27.   The redevelopment of naval bases at Devonport, Portsmouth,andfosyth forms the major element of the works programme currently in hand for the Navy,   Consideration is being given to a redevelopment at Chatham.Other important elements are concerned with facilities for the Polarisforce, for the weapon and ship testing programme, and for storage,Works Services will be required for the reorganisation of the Army in^ the United Kingdom and to enable Army units to occupy certain surplusHA? stations. Further details are given in Chapter I paragraphs 67 and 68,- 126 -CONFIDENTIALLii
CONFIDENTIAL29.   About  3 million will be spent on providing modern storage facilities in the United Kingdom for the RAF; work will continue onthe requirements for Jaguar aircraft and on other operationalfacilities including aircraft and engine test houses to reduce the noise of testing aircraft engines.   Work will start on forwardoperating   bases, on    facilities   for the MRCA,and on permanent headquarters at Reading for ths European Centre forMedium Range Weather Forecasts.3o.   The programme of improving living accommodation for single Service-*en will continue, aa will the modernisation of existing married quarters.   The redeployment of a number of Army and RAF units hasresulted in married quarters becoming vacant in some areas whilstshortages exist in others.   Some 1200 new married quart era will be started over the next year.31.   Harried quarters for which there is no long term requirement arebeing disposed of as quickly as possible and additional receipts to thedefence budget in the period up to 1979/80 are foreseen as a result ofanticipated increased sales.   Quarters temporarily vacant but requiredagain in the future will, where possible, be offered for short termlease to the local authority.   Quarters at a number of placesincluding Plymouth   and Hereford have already been offered in this way.32.   Work has begun on the first stage of the programme to rationalizeProcurement Executive Research and Development Establishmentsmentioned in Chaptsr III paragraphs 29-30.33,   Overseas the major effort will be in Germany where, in additionto the existing programme of modernising single living accommodation for the Army and RAF, works services will be required for the re-organisation of the Array in order to achieve the savings announced inthe 1975 Statement on the Defence Estimates.- 127 -g Nircpj3gTIA 
HIRINGS3lj..   Hiring married quarters for all three Services will cost about 32 million in 1976/77-   Moat.of the expenditure is in west germany where the number of hirings is still increasing although not as quickly as previously envisaged. By the end of 1976/77 the totalis expected to reach some 23,500.MOVEMENTS35.   Essential personnel movements tasks in 1975/76 have been under-taken by the Royal Air Force Transport Force supplemented by a charter contract to North West Europe.   Following the progressive reduction of the Air Transport Force, as a result of the defence review, charter trooping has been extended to Gibraltar.Studies   to examine how the air movement requirement can bemet for 1976/77 have recently been completed.36.   Availability of Service movement resources has been an important factor in implementing the Defence Review decisions to withdraw from overseas theatres.    The Royal Fleet Auxiliaries - landing shipslogistic and overseas stores carriers - have taken the lead on freight-movement while the Royal Air Force Transport Force has been primarily responsible for personnel movement.37.   Routine passenger and freight movement has been carried outeffectively throughout the past year despite financial constraints,This includes the requirement to move units to and from Northern Irelandand to and from overseas exercise areas such as Suffield in Canada.BIRD CONTROL36,.  as a result of a two-year trial into the efficacy of bird controlunite in reducing acoidents from bi*d-etrikee in close proximity to- 128 -coBHRanittkCONFIDENTIAL
airfields, the RAP is establishing these units on a number of selected airfields.METEOROLOGY39.    The Meteorological Office continues to make considerable useof computer forecasts.    Greater reliance is being placed on them as refinements are made to the numerical model used in their production.^0.    A new North Atlantic Ocean Stations (NAOS) scheme wasinaugurated in July 1975.    Pour Ocean Weather Stations (OWS) are maintained in the Central and Eastern North Atlantic Ocean,    TheUnited Kingdom operates OWS Lima (570 North 200 West) and two ships are to be refurbished to continue this work.   An international agreement provides for joint financing of the NAOS scheme ;      aninternational board,, in collaboration with the World MeteorologicalOrganisation,administers the agreement.fc1.    On the research side, studies carried out on behalf of thedepartment of Industry have indicated that currently foreseenoperations of supersonic aircraft in the stratosphere are unlikely to have a detectable effect on the environment.   3ven if several hundred such, aircraft are brought into service, changes In the amountof global ozone and in average surface temperatures are likely tohe small compared to those that occur naturally,te.    l^further research is being undertaken into the character and extent of recent climatic variations and into the factors which mayinfluence climate.   The theoretical study of these factors is verycomplex and requires large scale mathematical computation on the meteorological Office computer.- 129 -CONFIDENTIAL
