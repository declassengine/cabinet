THE SHIPBUILDING industry memorandum by the Secretary of State for industry. At their meeting on 26 February the Ministerial Committee onEconomic and Industrial Policy asked me to inform the Cabinet of thedesperate outlook for the shipbuilding industry - perhaps the most difficultindustrial issue we face with intractable problems both short and long term,2.        The main features of the situation are:-a. The world market for ships is exceptionally difficult.    new orders over the next five years may run at only 25 per cent of worldcapacity,,b. United Kingdom shipyards are unccmpetitive in price - theJapanese are undercutting us by up to 50 per cent and Europeanyards by up to 20 per cent - and are taking very few orders indeed,(See table at Annex A. )c. Unless substantial new or&amp;eTB are placed soon - and withouturgent special Government action this is unlikely - the numbers employed in the industry will by the end of 1977 be reduced by 35, 000or half the present level of 70,000.    Contraction of the industry would also have a serious effect on those indirectly employed insupplying industries.d. In the long term the prospects of the industry will depend onthe success of British Shipbuilders (BS) in increasing productivity and cutting cOBts.    But manpower is likely to be substantially lessthan now either because BS succeed and produce the same output withfewer men or because they fail and are unable to obtain any orders.e. Without urgent and significant measures, a great many ship-yard workers will be out of employment for a long time onTyxveeide, Wearside, Merseyside and the Upper and Lower Clyde.Local male unemployment rates in some shipyard areas (eg Bideford,Greenock, and Wearside) will exceed 20 per cent and persist into the1980s.1C(76) 24 COPY NO     SI1 March 1976CABINET
3fl        To ease this situation we need to take steps a. to secure additionalorders particularly within the next few months and b. to *aso the social consequences of the contraction which in any circumstances seemsunavoidable.    Following the Ministerial Committee&apos;s discussion and earlier discussions of the Ministerial Committee on IndustrialDevelopment the following action is in hand:-a. I shall be discussing with the Organising Committee for BSboth the development of a long-term strategy for the industry and an interim strategy for the next 18 months until BS can prepare their first corporate plan,    I will bring forward the latter by 1 May.b. We have agreed in principle to extend the cost escalationguarantee scheme to home shipbuilding orders and to Introduce ascheme of performance bonds against the possible failure of thoseshipbuilding companies which are to be nationalised.    The second ofthese proposals has been cleared by the European Commission butthe first iB still being discussed with them,c. The Secretary of State for Trade and I will jointly see theGeneral Council of British Shipping and then leading individualshipowners to bring the strongest possible pressure to bear on themto place what orders are going in United Kingdom yards.    If this approach is unsuccessful we shall need to consider legislation,possibly in relation to tax benefits (see further below).d Officials are undertaking a cost/benefit analysis of theconsequences of inducing the United Kingdom shipping industry tobear the additional costs which might result from placing moreorders in United Kingdom shipyards at a time when United Kingdomprices are uncompetitive and also of the effects of government assistance for this purpose.e0        We are exploring with our Community partners the possibilityof joint pressure on the Japanese Government to ease the pressure ofthe Japanese industry on the world shipbuilding market, perhapsleading to an international agreement to limit over-capacity. &apos; Butthis is unlikely to yield early results.f. The Ministerial Committee on Economic and fcidnstrial policy have agreed in principle on a number of specific measures to ease the consequences of contraction - selective financial assistance to bemade available for shipbuilding areas on more flexible terms than under the normal administrative guidelines; further building of advance factories; consideration by the National Enterprise Boardand the Scottish Development Agency of the scope for joint venturesor projects of their own in the shipbuilding areas; BS to redeployworkers within the industry to the extent possible; the Manpower
Services Commission to consider whtit help they can give.    But if further substantial orders are not forthcoming, these measures canonly have a limited effect,g., The Ministerial Committee also agreed that there should be :special scheme of redundancy compensation for shipyard workers and that this should be financed by the Government separately fromtheir general funding of BS.    I am working out details and amconsidering further whether to take the necessary legislative powersh. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will be bringing forward proposals on Harland and Wolff.,4. I ask the Cabinet to note the extremely serious situation facing the shipbuilding industry and the steps being taken to ease it.    However, as theabove notes make clear, this action may have no more than a limitedimpact.    I believe that if the Secretary of State for Trade and I areunsuccessful in our approach to United Kingdom shipowners we should beready to consider even more drastic, and perhaps unprecedented, action.I believe, for example, we should examine carefully the position in relationto 100 per cent first year depreciation allowances.    At present, as Iunderstand it, shipping companies qualify for these allowances whetherthey place orders at home or abroad.    I believe we should seriouslyexamine the possibility of withdrawing first year allowances in cases whereorders are placed abroad.   I also believe we may need to consider further improvements in the export credit terms we offer in relation to orders placed at home.    I am not making specific proposals on these points in this paper.    But I ask my colleagues for general support in principle for takingdrastic measures to save the shipbuilding industry, against the background of which I can pursue specific proposals with those colleagues directly concerned.5.        I regard this as the industrial problem facing the Government whichshould be given top priority.   Falling urgent action Britain could face theparadox of becoming a leading maritime nation without a substantial ship-building capability - a permanent importer and prisoner of overseasshipbuilding countries.E G V Department of industry March 19763
