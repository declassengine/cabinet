PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY 1976 -THE ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. Under the procedure which we agreed last year for launching theannual public expenditure exercise, I now give my colleagues an assess-msnt of the economic background. Aftsr we have considered this, I willas soon as poe*Abl* propose ground rules for preparing the report on the1976 public expenditure survey, covering the period up to 1980-81,2.        The 1975 survey faced us with particularly difficult decisions which inevitably required a great deal of thought and time.    consequently the White paper on Public Expenditure to 1979-80 (Cmnd. 6393) was not published until 19 February - three months later than norms,!.    Theoverlap between the work on this White paper and the work on estimates and cash limits for 1976-77, and to some extent the preparations for theBudget, has imposed a good deal of strain on the administrative machine.We must aim this year to complete the exercise more quickly so that thenext White Paper can be published in November.    For practical reasons,therefore, it would be desirable to base the new public expenditure surveyso far as possible on the decisions we have so recently taken and to avoidre-opening policies at such a short interval if this can humanly be avoided.3.        Nevertheless we cannot ignore relevant developments which havetaken place since the basis of the last survey was settled.    Moreover, inthis new survey we will be rolling public expenditure programmes forward by a further year, to 1980-81, and we need to consider what difference thisextra year makes to the outlook.    We must distinguish clearly between threethings - predictions about the future which must be particularly uncertain atthis moment in the British and the world economy; projections based on past trends, which are simply a useful and necessary tool to help in planning our policies and objectives, but no more than that; and objectives,which must determine the policies we adopt.THE WHITE PAPER PROJECTIONS4.        There is widespread public misunderstanding about the projectionsmade in the Medium Term Appraisal.    This appraisal does not set out aneconomic strategy nor are its projections a suitable tool for determiningevery aspect of our economic policy.   Its prime function is to provide asetting for our public expenditure decisions.C(76) 25 0 iCOPY NO   g *5 March, 1976CABINET
5.        For this purpose we make forward projections of the resourceslikely to be available over the medium term, distributing them in a patternconsistent with the achievement of growth, full employment and asatisfactory balance of payments.    This kind of Medium Term Appraisaltakes account of Government policies on such matters as the attack oninflation, the balance of payments and industrial strategy, and makesassumptions about their success in contributing towards reaching thesituation projected in the appraisal.    It does not however attempt todetermine what other policies may be required to make the projectionscome true.    The Medium Term Appraisal approach is reflected in the table on the Growth and Use of Resources 1974-79 which appears on page of our recant public expenditure White Paper.    The central case in column II of the table shows an average rate of growth of the gross domestic product (GDP) between 1974-79 of just under 3j per cent a year;by implication this is the growth rate to which our plans are related.6.        But we were warned from the outset that in practice this growth rate is uncertain.    The White Paper table also shows the implications ofa rather faster growth rate during the period, warning that it would be imprudent to count on such an improvement.    It also sets out the implications of a lower growth rate, just under z\ per cent a year, statingthat the risks on the downward side are the greater and that this lowercase should therefore be regarded as purely illustrative and not necessarilya lower limit.UPDATING OF THE PROJECTIONS7.        Since our White Paper decisions. Treasury economists have taken a further look at these projections, though this does not constitute a fullnew Medium Term Appraisal;  further work over a period of months wouldbe required for that.    The most obvious change since the last Medium TermAppraisal is that the world recession has been deeper and more prolonged,and the upturn so far more sluggish than we had reckoned on.    There isalso the possibility that unemployment in most of the industrial countries may be significantly higher for some time to come, at any point in thetrade cycle, than it has been in the past.    British Ministers have taken theinitiative in insisting that this possibility should be thoroughly considered at international meetings and everything possible done to reduce it.    If ouranxiety should prove to be well-founded, we should have to pursue our national objectives on employment and the balance of payments in an inter-national environment more difficult than at any time since World War II.The economists suggest that in this case it would be dangerous to baseresource planning on the firm assumption that we can devise a combination of policies which will enable us, by 1979. to achieve the state of affairsrepresented by the central case in the White Paper projections; theystress, moreover, that those projections took full account of the benefits from North Sea oil up to and including 1979, when the net saving on our balance of payments could be around  4 billion.2
8.        Critics of the White Paper have been quick to point to the rapid growth in GDP and in manufacturing output which would be required inorder to reduce unemployment to previous high levels by 1979.    My owneconomists agree that, assuming 2 per cent growth in 1976, we should need a much higher growth rate for GDP over the next three yearsaveraging roughly S\ per cent a year, and for manufacturing output a growth rate averaging something like 8^ per cent.    It is not suggestedthat, because of this, we should abandon our full employment objections;that is not what the appraisal is about.    But it does make clear that wecannot now expect to achieve our objective without improving on our pastperformance in several fields.   And it reinforces previous warningsabout the need to avoid over-optimism in planning public expenditure.9.        The economists also suggest that, though we should seek to raisethe rate of productivity growth from the recent trend of roughly 3 per cent a year, the current recession may have worked in tbe opposite direction;but if so this would certainly make it possible to reach our employmentobjective at a lower rate of output growth than otherwise assumed.    Onthe other hand a lower rate of output growth would increase the effectiveproportion of resources taken by our public expenditure programmes.10.       The preliminary appraisal also indicates that it may be lessdifficult to achieve the required combination of full employment and amanageable balance of payments when we look beyond 1979.    On currentestimates the output of North Sea oil would still be growing by the early1980&apos;a, and the additional net saving on imports, as compared with theprevious period, might come to  1-2 billion.    On the other hand, therswould then be a large annual burden of interest on our external debt andby then we must also start repaying the capital borrowed if we are ever to clear off this accumulation of liabilities.    Tbe full extent of this problem In the 1980&apos;a will depend on the extent to which we can make a successful adjustment to the difficult years immediately ahead.    We must therefore allow for these serious uncertainties about the future in ourpublic expenditure planning.OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES11.       I believe it should be our objective to get unemployment down toabout 3 per cent, or 700, 000, by the end of 1979.    It would be unwise to publish mis as a prediction, but we should frame our policies towards this objective, in the knowledge that the taak is not easy and success doesnot depend on the British Government or the British economy alone.    Norare all the required policy decisions possible or necessary in a single year,still less a single Budget.12.       Our industrial strategy is one of the most important policyinstruments for achieving this objective.    This is not the place for further discussion of the industrial strategy, but a word about its implications for public expenditure is relevant.    We must give high priority to funds forcost-effective selective measures, on the one hand, and room must be found for this within the White Paper figures; our reputation at home and abroad3
requires us to show that we are capable of implementing and adhering toour declared plans.    On the other hand we must ensure that planned public expenditure is consistent with our industrial strategy so that the necessaryresources are available for the required level of exports, investment a&amp;dtake-home pay.    We cannot indefinitely increase public expenditure andtaxation and pile up debt; the pursuit of a policy of that kind would very quickly come to grief and would require a massive cut-back withdevastating economic and political consequences.    If any revision of ourcurrent programmes is required this is much more likely to be downwardsthan upwards.13.       The danger that the international environment will be less favourabledoes not justify pessimism, but it must reinforce our determination tomake ourselves more competitive; we shall have to fight harder to increase our share of world markets if we are to achieve our employment objectiveswithout intolerable deficits in our balance of payments.14.      So far as the coming PESC exercise is concerned it would be much better if we could avoid reopening policies,    I am not here proposing afurther scaling down of the White Paper programmes, and I hope thatthese can remain the point of departure for the 1976 survey.   At the sametime the survey could be carried out in such a way as to explore the implications of departures from the White Paper programmes in onedirection or the other, if circumstances should require us to consider anysuch move.    Moreover, we have already announced our readiness toconsider some shift of current priorities for public spending if the needsof the community require it.    I suggest that we should aim to take themain decisions arising from the survey in the summer, when we could take account of any further material emerging from the continuousmonitoring of the economic situation which is required in this difficult period.CONCLUSIONS15.      I propose, therefore, that the 1976 public expenditure review should be based so far as possible on the decisions reflected in the recentpublic expenditure White Paper, but that account should also be taken ofthe economic background which I have summarised above.  I propose thatI should circulate specific ground rules for preparing the survey reporton this basis for discussion between us at an early meeting.D W treasury Chambers5 March 19764
