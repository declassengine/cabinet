C(76) 18 COPY UO      ,;; -17 February 1976CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE - THS COMTETGEilCY RESERV2llenorandui^ by the Chr.ncellor of the exchequer,     At our meeting on 5 February wo agreed that, where the Chief secretary and I a^e not ready to accept proposed additional expenditure as a charge on the contingency reserve, and the natter is then referred to Cabinet, itwould be desirable at the same tine to have a report on the state of the contingency reserve.     We have now beon asked by the Secretary of State for social Services to consider whether there is a case for reversing thedecision of the EC Committee last November against leaking a winter fuelparent at a cost of  105 million.     So that my colleagues can consider this in relation to the state of the contingency reserve, and as this isthe first opportunity for applying this new procodurc, I enclose an initialprogress report on the contingency reserve, together with a note explaining&apos;the objectives of those periodical reports and the guidelines for drawingthem up.2.     At one stage it was suggested that the proposed winter fuel paymentmight partly be made in the last few days of the current financial year,1975-76.     But it is not now expected that payment could start sooner thanthe week beginning 5 April, so that the whole of this expenditure, ifapproved, would be a charge on the contingency reserve for 1976-77.3.     It will be seen from the progress report that the contingency reserve for 1976-77 is shown in the White Paper as  700 nillion in 1975 survey price which in cash terms is put at  875 nillion.     Against this, we have already accepted claims amounting to  136 million, principally for the package of measures announced last week in order to help industry and employment.1
There are also firm bids, some of -then requiring early decision, involvingaround  350 million, including the proposed winter fuel payment.     And then there are other claims, which have not yet been translated into firm proposals, but many of which are certain to come forward in due course,involving approximately a further  450 million.4.     The total of these actual or potential claims on the contingency reserve for 1976-77 is around  900 aillion and, if all of then materialisedin full, they world by themselves be approximately equal to the wholeprovision in the contingency reserve.     Some of these requirements are moreinevitable than others.     None of the items in the list is fanoiful;    infact the list excludes certain items which in their nature are unprogrammed,so that any approved expenditure has to be met from the contingency reserve,principally on the industry front, and it may understate the potential size of some other bids.     Nor does it make any allowance for possible new proposals in the social security field.     This is the picture at mid-February before 1976-77 has even begun.     Claims are also building upalready for later years, as can be seen from Table 2 of the progress report.5.     Against this background it is important for us to choose our prioritiescarefully and to avoid all but the most overriding new commitments.    In rayview the proposed winter fuel payment does not fall in this category.DUETreasury Chambers17 February 19762
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE - THE CONTINGENCY RESERVEPROGRESS REPORTSOBJECTIVES1.   The arrangements set out below are directed toward the objective of implementing the public expenditure plans approved by Cabinet.These plans are embodied in the White Paper on Public Expenditure to1979-80.2.   The Cabinet have endorsed proposals by the Prime Minister underwhich all requirements for expenditure additional to the programmefigures in the White Paper will, if they are not accepted by treasury Ministers aa a charge on the contingency reserve, bereferred to Cabinet.   The intention is that they should so far aspossible be considered by Cabinet in batcb.es and in the light of anote on the state of the contingency reserve.   These procedures areto be administered flexibly.3.   In order to adhere to the approved expenditure plan and to giveeffect to this procedure, the contingency reserve has to be treatedas a fully operational concept.   Progress reports on the contingency reserve will have the following objectives -(i)     To enable Treasury Ministers to consider individual claims onthe contingency reserve in relation to the amount availablein the contingency reserve and other claims on it.(ii)   To enable Treasury Ministers to report to their colleaguesso that Cabinet can consider any individual expenditureproposals referred to them in relation to the amount availablein the contingency reserve and other claims on it.II     GUIDELINESA-.     In order to make the contingency reserve viable as an operationalarrangement, it has been set at an unprecedentedly high level inthe White Paper.   The figure for 1976-77 is  700 million at 1975
survey prices;   in  cash  terms  this represents  875 million.     Thefigures  for  the  three   succeeding  years  are  900 million, 1,200 million and  1,400 million respectively,   all   in   1975  survey prices.     It  is  not  possible  to  anticipate  what  these  figures  will represent  in  cash  terms.5.     The  progress  reports will  hnve  separate  tables  relating  (a)   to1976-77 only and  (b)   both to   1976-77  and  the  three  succeeding years.Both  tables  will   show expenditure  already approved  as  charges on the  contingency reserve  and  further claims,   actual  or foreseen,which remain to be  dealt  with.6.     These  reports will   provide  a basis  for consideration of:-(a) Additions  to White Paper programmes resulting from new policy proposals  and new projects.(b) Additions  to  the White Paper  estimates  of the  costof existing programmes  or policies or projects whichare  the responsibility of particular departmental ministers.7.     It  is  also  envisaged  that  the   197&amp;   survey will   provide  anopportunity  to  consider  claims  for  additional  expenditure  inthe years after  1976-77,  if these  issues have not been resolvedmeanwhile.$.     New expenditure which is  accommodated within existing  Departmentaltotals,   by means  of offsetting  savings  where necessary,   will not be  a claim on the  contingency reserve.     If new expenditure  is  approved onthe basis that offsetting  savings  are  to be  found,  but  the  savingsremain  to be  identified  and  agreed,   the  expenditure will  be  debitedagainst the contingency reserve until the offsetting savings have been settled.9.    It is intended to consult inter-Departmentally about thedevelopment and application of these guidelines in the light of experience.
