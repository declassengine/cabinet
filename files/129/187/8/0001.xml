STUDENT SUPPORT, SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS ANDU NE MPLOY MENTMemorardum by the Secretary of State for Education and science. The purpose of this memorandum is to comment on the immediateissues raised in the Chief Secretary^ memorandum C(76) 7.THE CHIEF SECRETARY &apos;S proposals.        The Chief Secretary asks for immediate decisions on four issues:i. Starting not later than March 1976, publish statistics ofunemployment separately from statistics of students who registerfor employment in their vacations,ii. Instruct officials to explore immediately with the localauthority associations and a variety of other interests th*a possibilityof paying students in advance  23 from the summer instalment ofthe student grant with the aim of removing them from the scope ofsupplementary benefits during the Easter 1976 vacation.iii. Indicate publicly our intention to adjust the system of studentsupport to obviate students1 use of supplementary benefits in the short vacations.iv. Acceptance in principle that students should be legislated outof their present entitlement to unemployment and supplementary benefit.COMMENT3.        I agree entirely with the proposal in 2.i. above regarding the presentation of the unemployment statistics.    I also agree to the proposal in paragraph 2. iii. above on the understanding that it refers to the interimscheme for the academic year 1976-77 already agreed by Social ServicosCommittee.1C(76) 8 COPY NO     313 February 1976CABINET
4.        Regarding the scheme outlined in paragraph 2,il. above, I consider this totally impracticable.    I see no prospect whatsoever of securing theagreement to this complicated procedure of the four parties named inparagraph 2 of Annex I of the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper.    In addition:i. Institutions would not know precisely which students wouldbe entitled to the additional payment.ii. There are legal difficulties about both my power to makethe necessary payments to institutions and local educationauthorities1 powers to make deductions 5rom subsequent grantpayments.I do not think that this proposal has been adequately thought through eitheradministratively, financially or legally.5.        Turning to the issues of principle raised in paragraph 2,iv. above,I consider that the proposal to legislate students out of supplementary benefit is indefensible.    Since 1962 the value of the student grant has fallen substantially both in real terms and relative to other sections ofthe community and to benefit rates.    For most students it is now essentialto work in vacations in order to supplement their grant.    They must therefore be free to register for employment, and when work is notavailable they are entitled to have access to supplementary benefit toensure that they do not fall below a subsistence level of income.    to deny them access to supplementary benefit would be unjust.    It goeswithout saying that It would be even harder to justify legislating out ofunemployment benefit students who have qualified for it by paying thecontributions required by law.    Legislation on either of these fronts, or both together, would be bitterly opposed by, among others, many of ourown supporters, and educational interests, including teacher unions in theTrades Union Congress.    It would be very controversial and would, inmy view, be extremely difficult to get through Parliament.    It would therefore represent an unwelcome addition to our already difficultlegislative programme.ALTERNATIVE PROPOSAL6. An alternative proposal for the longer term, which does not involve legislation, would be as follows.Apply all or part of the proceeds of withdrawing Child tax allowances from students1 parents to compensating them for thatloss, which would otherwise increase the burden on them of paying a contribution towards the maintenance of their student sons anddaughters; and deal with student claims for supplementary benefit by continuing in the long term the 1976-77 interim scheme already agreed.    (Under this scheme the student grant will be increased2
as necessary to provide an amount equal to the singlenon-householder rate of benefit in the short vacations.    Theeffect is to price most students out of entitlement to supplementary benefit in the short vacations, and in a full year it saves nearly 1 million of public expenditure,conclusion.        I invite my colleagues to reject the proposal outlined inparagraph 2,ii, above, and I recommend that the further consideration oflonger-term issues should exclude any proposal to legislate students outof unemployment or supplementary benefits.F MDepartment of Education and Science3 February 19763
