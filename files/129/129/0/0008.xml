EXPLICATIONS OF ENTRY INTO EUROPE FOR MOBILITY OF LABOUR AND IMMIGRATION POLICYSupplementary report &quot;by officials the Cabinet when considering the report by officials on the implications for mobility of labour and immigration policy of United Kingdom entry into europe (G(67) 48) directed that officials should prepare a further report on -A. the experience of mobility of labour under the provisionsof the Treaty of Rome of a member of the e.c. where conditions were broadly comparable with those in the United Kingdom;B. the machinery for control of immigration and movement which wouldbe required in the United Kingdom;G.   the extent (if any) to which the United Kingdom would have theright to deport e.c. nationals;D. the possibility that the e.c. would accord unrestricted freedomof movement within the Community to e.c. nationals;E. the implications for the right of entry into other member countries of the e.c. of United Kingdom citizens of Commonwealth origin,including those now resident in other countries of the Commonwealth.The following report deals in turn with these five aspects.A.     THE EXPERIENCE OF A EUROPEAN COUNTRY UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE TREATYOF ROMS COVERING- FREE MOVEMENT OF LABOUR - BELG-IUMReasons for selecting Belgium2.     We were asked to report on the experience of mobility of labour under theprovisions of the Treaty of Rome of a member of e.c. where conditions were broadly comparable with those in the United Kingdom.   Of the Six, Italy isa country with a manpower surplus which seeks to export labour and would clearly not be appropriate,   Germany is at the opposite extreme with a manpowershortage which has made it necessary to bring in very large numbers offoreign workers.   The majority have come from countries outside the EECunder bilateral arrangements.   Our information Is that Italian workers inGermany have also generally been recruited through similar arrangements made before the e.c. was founded.   The requirements of the Treaty of Rome do not,therefore, seem to have had very much influence on the movement of labourinto Germany up to the present.
3.     At first sight, Franco would seem to be a suitable country to selectbut the picture is complicated by the presence of large numbers of Algerianworkers (550?000 at the beginning of this year) who can enter France undera quota system established by the Evian Agreement.     Furthermore, we do nothave detailed and up-to-date information about the operation of e.c. ruleson free movement of labour in France and we have felt it unwise to ask theFrench authorities for this at the present time.     This leaves the benelux countries who have formed a small common labour market of their own since1957*     Of these, we have selected Belgium both because detailed information about that country is readily to hand and because its policy towards the entry of foreign workers for some years has been liberal and in advance ofthe requirements of e.c. Regulations.     The experience of Belgium is,therefore, more likely to provide a key to what may happen in the futureunder Community rules which seem likely to provide for freer movement.What follows is largely based on a discussion which our Labour attache in Brussels recently had with officials of the Belgian Ministry ofEmployment and Labour.k-.     The total working population of Belgium is approximately if million.The number of wholly unemployed fell in recent years from an average of132,000 for 1959 to 50,000 in 1964.     In the summer of 1966 there were55?000 wholly unemployed and the figure rose to 75,000 at the end of theyear.     In March 19^7 it was 80,000.     At the end of 1966 there were&apos;reported to be approximately 200,000 foreign workers in Belgium of whom12,000 were wholly unemployed.     Foreign workers accounted for 2 in 3 ofall coal-face workers and 1 in 5 of all engineering workers.The__issu.es of labour pj3rmi.j;s^ in Belgium for e.c. citizens5.     Citizens of the other Benelux countries (i*e. the Netherlands and luxembourg) are entirely free to enter the country and take work.     Theydo not need a labour permit and the authorities do not know how many are working in Belgium.     Other e.c. citizens require a work permit but receiveone automatically on request.     They do not have to be recruited throughofficial channels or have a specific job to go to.     On arrival in thecountry they can obtain a special e.c. permit card on producing evidence of nationality and residence in Belgium,     The e.c. card is made out in fourlanguages.     It is valid for all jobs and is of unlimited duration.The issue gf^Jlabjqur permits for non-e.c. citizens6.     The Belgian Ministry of Labour consults with the employers and tradeunions once a year on the general rules for the issue of permits.     No attempt is made to lay down rules or quotas for particular industrial sectors and theunions are not consulted on individual cases.     Permits are issued on the-2-COWF1DENTIAI
Uasis of the circumstances in each case and are for one year only.Formerly, they could he issued to persons who had arrived in the country astourists and wished to take work.     In view of the recent rise in umemployment this practice has ceased and the Belgian authorities nowrequire non-e.c. citizens to find a job and obtain a permit before theyarrive in the country.Priority in placing&quot; e.c. ^tizens7.     In accordance with Treaty obligations e.c. citizens receive priority over workers from other countries.     In practice, technicians, managers,bilingual secretaries etc. from non-e.c. countries who are clearly needed byfirms in Belgium and cannot be replaced by Belgians, receive permitswithout difficulty.     Unskilled manual and office workers, however, from non-e.c. countries, must take their place behind e.c. citizens.     Neverthelessup till 1966 the number of permits granted to non-e.c. citizens greatlyexceeded the number granted to e.c. citizens.Use of the safeguard clause in Regulation J8.8.     Belgium used this clause (which permits e.c. countries to give priority to their nationals in occupations and regions ^7here there is a considerablesurplus of labour) initially for minor clerical occupations, entertainmentartists and coal-miners.     The authorities have now ceased to use itbecause they have found that it is not really needed.     In the case of clerical workers, Italians, for example, would not normally have thenecessary language qualifications to compete with Belgian workers.     Inthe case of French or Luxembourg workers who would have the necessarylanguages, experience has shown that they are very unlikely to migrate to belgium for this type of clerical work.     In the ca.se of entertainmentartists, the Belgian authorities have said that control might be desirablebut is very difficult to achieve and for this reason hardly worth pursuing.In coalmining where the intention was to safeguard surface employment for workers already employed underground, the restriction clause was found notto be necessary because employers normally reserved surface jobs for theirunderground workers of their own accord.Problems which might .arise in the event, of.iineonlovment9.     The Belgian view is that situations of employment difficulty rightthemselves.     If there are fewer employment opportunities in Belgium at a given moment the Italians will probably decide for themselves not to move to Belgium and if a, foreign worker becomes redundant he may decide for-3-
himself to return hone:    a proportion of foreign workers may he the moreanxious to do so because they have left their families at home.     If an employer has only one job to offer and there are two applicants - one belgian and one a foreigner - both of whom must be paid the same wages, he will naturally take the Belgian.     The Belgian authorities have pointed out thatthey can always notify the exporting country (i.e. Italy), through the EECmachinery, that employment prospects are not good and they consider thatthis warning will be effective because there is alwaysa considerable amount of coming and going of migrants.     They have pointed,in addition, to the &quot;grape vine&quot; among Italian workers themselves which,in their experience, is reasonably effective in discouraging new entrants,when job prospects deteriorate.     Finally, they point out that Belgium, likethe other importing e.c. countries, can always reduce immigration from non-EECsources.Conclusion - Effect of free movement of labour10.   Belgium has pursued a liberal policy, in advance of the e.c. regulations,because it needs labour from abroado     National planning envisages that anincrease of 3i&quot; per cent to 4 per cent in production each year will require an inflow in gross figures of some 30,000 foreign workers a year.     The Belgianauthorities estimate that the effect of their policy in granting free entryand priority to e.c. citizens has been to increase the percentage of the latterin the total entry of immigrants from 30 per cent to 50 per cent.     Theyhave pointed particularly to the effect of granting a permit to an e.c. citizenbefore he has found a job.     This means that the employer has no formalitiesto bother with.     As soon as the man presents himself the employer can makea decision and can take him on at once if he wishes.     There is no questionof a doubt about the issue of a permit or a delay while the authorities consultor deliberate.     The Belgian authorities finally point out that French andGerman practice up to now has not been as liberal as their own.     In thosecountries the immigrant must have a job to go to before he can be given anEEC permit card.
B.     MACHINERY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM FOR CONTROL OF IMMIGRATION AMD MOVEMENT11.   It is not easy to say what effect entry into e.c. might have on our system for control of immigration by aliens.     There would have to be a system of appeals against decisions to refuse entry or to deport, but any systemestablished for our own purposes in consequence of the report, expected withina. few months, of the Committee on Immigration Appeals would almost certainlysuffice for e.c. purposes.     On a purely practical point, there might well be pressure for special treatment for e.c. nationals at the ports of entry, andthis might conceivably lead to the provision of a fourth channel of control:the channels would then be United Kingdom, Commonwealth, e.c., non-e.c. aliens.This would be expensive in staff and additional facilities.12.   More generally, if we were to enter e.c. it seems likely that we wouldcone under pressure from our fellow member nations to assimilate our system of immigration to theirs, since their nationals might be expected to complainabout our procedure for scrutiny at the ports.     And in any event relaxation of admission for e.c. workers (even if not subsequently extended to othercountries) might make it impracticable for us to carry on without additionalinternal controls.     The e.c.&quot; system of labour mobility has been built up within a -framework of immigration systems which admit workers freely, andwhich deport them freely if they prove to be undesirable.     It is not clearthat our methods would prove apt for such a system, but only experience candecide this, one way or another.13-   It is commonly said that we operate an external system, at the ports,and that the e.c. countries operate an internal system.     This is not reallytrue.     All countries operate both an internal and external control, or rather there are the two aspects of each system.     If we were to go over tothe e.c. system, we would still need at the ports, at minimum, a system of keeping out undesirables who were on a Suspect Index;    and there is alreadyquite a substantial internal aspect to our control (registration with thepolice, registration at hotels, job control, need to apply for extension ofstay).     But it is true that we carry matters further at the ports than the eec countries, and it is probably because of this that we have to deportfewer people and in consequence are more reluctant to deport - we are nothabituated to deportation as a routine remedy for dealing with people whom itwould have been better not to admit.-5-
14.   If we were to go over to seme.thing like the e.c. system of immigration control, there would have to he more reporting of movements of aliens within this country.     It would probably be unnecessary for us to have a system ofnational registration for our own people;   but hotels, lodging houses andpossibly private hosts might well have-to record or report movements of aliensto the police, and there would probably have to be a general tightening up ofsurveillance of aliens by the police.     There would not necessarily have to beany extension of formal registration with the police by aliens.C.     POWERS OF DEPORTATION OF e.c. NATIONALS AFTER ENTRY INTO EEC15.   At present the Home Secretary has power to deport any alien followingconviction of an offence punishable by imprisonment and a recommendation for deportation by the court, or where he considers deportation to be conducive tothe public good.16.   Following entry into e.c. these powers of deportation would be circumscribedunder the e.c. rules (quite apart from the institution of an appeal system),as would also be the power to refuse entry to this country.     It appears thatESC members can deport or refuse entry only on grounds of public policy, lawand order, public safety, and public health.     The action taken under these powers, except action taken on grounds of public health, must be basedexclusively on the personal behaviour of the Individual.17.   It seems doubtful -whether these restrictions would amount to much inpractice.     e.c. member countries appear to deport more freely than we do, andwe would not expect our practice to be significantly affected.18.   A query has been raised about the power to deport unemployed e.c. workers from this country.     Under the e.c. rules the power to deport must not be invoked to serve economic ends:   we take this provision to mean that we couldnot deport e.c. workers who had come here under whatever e.c. rules might applyto free movement of labour (i.e. at present the work permit system) but had failed to find employment or had subsequently fallen out of work.     We couldpresumably deport someone who, it subsequently transpired, had come here to live off Social Security benefits.
Supplementary Benefit 19.   At present Supplementary Benefit is available as a right to anyperson who is in Great Britain regardless of nationality or how longhe has been here.     If it were necessary to guard against a situationin which e.c. nationals who were in this country without a job could liveon Supplementary Benefit, it would be possible to amend the law so as to incorporate some kind of residence qualification for statutory supplementary benefit.     Such qualification   could not be confined to e.c. nationals -since this would incur a charge of disorimination - but would have toapply equally to all - including United Kingdom citizens and commonwealth immigrants as well as e.c. nationals.20.   It would, however, not be possible simply to leave people who werewithout resources and did not satisfy the residence qualification withoutany means of support;   provision of some kind of financial assistance on a discretionary basis would be needed.     With the circumsoribed right ofdeportation of workers who have come to this country under e.c. procedurereferred to in paragraph 18 above, the limitation of access to supplementary Benefit by means of a residence qualification would therefore not be very effective in securing the departure of such peopleonce they were here.     But it could act as some deterrent to theircoming here in the first place.21.   Northern Ireland have a five-year residence qualification in theirlegislation;   it is in general form but is of course designed to preventcitizens of the Irish Republic from moving into Northern Ireland for thispurpose.\-7-
22,   It is difficult to forecast how fast the Community will move towardscompleting the freedom of movement of workers in the e.c..   The european commission has recently submitted to the e.c. Council a new draft regulation and draft directive.   The main proposals made in the Commission1s drafts are -(i)   the safeguard clause, which at present permits a member state tore-establish priority for its own nationals in particularregions or occupations, would be abandoned.   There would bemore extensive exchange of information between the employmentservices of member states about supply and demand.   If, however,a member state experiences or expects serious difficulties in aparticular area or occupation, it will be open to that member state to notify the Commission.   If the Commission agrees that there is a risk of difficulties, all member states willoo-operate to discourage workers from moving to the affectedareas or occupations;(ii)   the issue of an e.c. &quot;Identity card&quot; (valid for five years, but only for the country In which it is issued) would replace the workpermit, but would only be issued on presentation by theapplicant of a formal offer of employment or a work permit;(iii)   improved machinery for linking offers and demands would be used toensure that applications from workers from other member states wouldbe submitted to employers before non-e.c. candiates are considered;(iv)   immigrant workers would in future be entitled to equality oftreatment with national workers in relation to tax and social insurance matters, housing, and membership of works councils.23.   It should be noted in connexion with (i) above that the Commission^proposal is based on the experience of the Community under the existing regulations.   It is not felt that there is any heed for legislativeprovisions in case of difficulties, given the existing general safeguards inthe Rome Treaty (Articles 103, 130 and 226).24.   In connexion with the Commission^ proposal at (iii) above, it wouldseem unlikely that priority could in reality be granted to e.c. nationalsover nationals of third countries who had already been admitted into amember country for work purposes.25.   Member states now have to consider the Commission&apos;s proposals in the eec Council.   The Italian Government is seeking their application by 1st July 1968.   Given the fact that the measures so far taken to free movementof labour have not caused any disturbances or difficulties to member states,and given the support in the trade unions in the Six for the measure so far-8-D.   ACHIEVEMENT OF UNRESTRICTED MOVEMENT OF LABOUR WITHIN THE COMMUNITY
-baken, it may be that the Commissions proposals vsAlJl. ho broadly aoeeptedby the e.c. Council, though some changes will no doubt be made.   What these changes will be and how soon the resulting new measures will be introducedcannot at present be foreseen.E.     IMPLICATIONS FOR COMONWEALTH IMMIGRATION(a) General26.   In relation to the Commonwealth, the basic dilemma confrontingus remains as stated in our earlier report (paragraph 8(v) of the Note by theChairman of the Official Committee on Approach to Europe attached toC(67) 48).   Our Commonwealth policy has been to control immigration from both the Old and the New Commonwealth because we wish, for  soundreasons, to limit the numbers entering from the New Commonwealth and do not wish to beseen to discriminate in favour of the Old Commonwealth.   If we maintain this policy unchanged we shall be restricting the number of citizens of all commonwealth countries who can come here for employment while permittingEEC nationals to come here freely for this purpose, with consequentialdissatisfaction throughout the Old as well as the New Commonwealth.    Ifalternately we took the opportunity to modify our policy, hy removing thepresent quota restrictions on immigration from the Old Commonwealth while continuing to regulate the inflow of immigrants from the New Commonwealth,we should go some way toward meeting the problem, but at the cost of introducing the principle of differentiation between the Old and the new commonwealth.   We assume that Ministers would take the view that our existing control over Nev/ Commonwealth Immigration cannot be removed.(b) Possible Freedom of Movement for United Kingdom Citizens of commonwealth Origin27.   Attempts by our Delegation in Brussels to elucidate the right to free movement within the Community of persons from the oversea dependenciesof Member Countries have demonstrated that the position is in some respectsobscure and may eventually need to be determined exther by the Commission orby the Court of Justice.   Basically the right to free movement within theCommunity depends on nationality, not residence: but it is not thought, (byCommission officials) that the right extends to persons from overseadependencies unless they have established some individual &quot;geographicalattachment&quot; to their metropolitan territory.   In any case, the Community hasnot so far had to contemplate the particular complexities of our nationality and citizenship provisions, and it is likely that if the United Kingdom entered the e.c. the application&apos;of freedom of movement to persons in the various categories of United Kingdom citizenship (see below) would require detailed consideration and negotiation.-9- ,
28c   Subject to the above caveat, it would be right not to overlook thepossible scope for movement from the United Kingdom to e.c. countries, with ayiew to obtaining employment, by persons of Commonwealth origin residenthere and possessing United Kingdom citizenship either by birth or byregistration under the British Nationality lets after five years1 residencein this country, on the assumption that in some circumstances at least theywould enjoy freedom of movement for that purpose.     At present the e.c. as awhole is short of labour and some countries have recruited large numbers ofworkers from outside the Community,     In Germany at the end of January 1967there were 171,000 Greek, 14-1,000 Spanish and 136,000 Turkish immigrantworkers.     Former citizens of other Commonwealth countries who had becomeUnited Kingdom citizens would enjoy priority in the Community labour marketover non-e.c. nationals.     If present trends in the European Labour Marketcontinue and if these United Kingdom citizens were willing to leave theirjobs here they might, therefore, find quite substantial opportunities for employment in other Community countries     However, any advantage that mightasorue to Commonwealth immigrants in this way - depending, as it would, onthe continuation of present trends in the European labour market - would be only a, slight political compensation for the implied change in ourimmigration arrangements resulting from the priority which vrould have to b egiven to e.c. nationals over Commonwealth citizens.29,   The inhabitants of our remaining dependent territories, althoughpossessing citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies, have no generalright of entry into the United Kingdom and would derive no right of entry into e.c. countries for employment purposes from United Kingdom accession tothe EECo(c)   Special Problem of United Kingdom tcitizens of^_AsJ._a.n_ ori^in^ in east Africa&quot;etc,30,   A particular problem arises in connection&quot; with the very substantial number of inhabitants of certain independent Commonwealth countries whoare not subject to our Commonwealth immigration control and who possess(because of the terms of local citizenship legislation) citizenship of theUnited Kingdom, in some cases instead of and in other cases in addition tothe local citizenship - in round figures 250,000 persons of Asian origin in east Africa, about 200,000 in Trinidad and something approaching 2 million in Malaysia and Singapore (,:The Queen&apos;s Chinese&quot;)0     If these United Kingloncitizens had gained entry to the United Kingdom by the exercise of their rights, they would appear to have the same rights of entry into theCommunity as United kingdom residents.     The vast majority of them are probably unaware of their right of entry into the United Kingdom and itseems most unlikely that in practice the countries of the e.c. (where nosimilar problem exists) would be willing to accord ttem freedom of entry 0
