CONFIDENTIAL 3 27DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT)C(67)  755th May, 1967COPY NO.CABINETTHE THIRD LONDON airport memorandum by the President of the Board of Tradeand the Minister of Housing and -Local GovernmentI - introduction the Cabinet considered on 13th April (CC(67) 20th Conclusions,Minute 3), a draft Yfhite Paper on the Third London Airport (C(6?) 50)and we were asked to circulate a further memorandum in the light ofthe discussion.    Doubts were expressed on two main points:  the needfor a new major airport for London in relation to the possibility of developing the existing London airports at Heathrow and Gatwick;and the suitability of Stansted as the site for the new airport in comparison,particularly, with a site on the Thames Estuary,,&quot;1(a)  The need for a third London airport, which rests entirely on civil aviation grounds, is dealt with in Part II of this memorandum.The choice, of Stansted, which involves planning and other arguments that concern us both, is the subject of Part IIL &quot;factors - the capacity of the existing major London airports (Keamrowand Gatwick) and the likely growth of the traffic wishing to use them.Capacity3,       The capacity of an airport, measured in terms of aircraftmovements per hour, depends cn the number and layout of its runwaysand their dimensions;  on the air traffic control,procedures;  and on localfactors, such as the existence of other active aerodromes nearby and thesensitivity of the surrounding area to noise.    On this basis, and in thelight of forecast improvements in air traffic control (ATC) and pilotingprocedures and technology the maximum sustainable hourly capacities inall weather 3 at the existing two London airports ar e likely to be 64 movementsartbour at Heathrow and 45 movements an hour at Gatwick (when the secondrunway is built) in the early years of the next decade.4,       These figures of capacity assume the lengthening of the No. 1runway at Heathrow, the construction of a second runv/ay at Gatwick,the extension westwards of the controlled airspace of the London TerminalArea, and the successful operation of new air traffic control procedures.They also assume no significant change in the degree of restriction onthe capacity of either airport arising from noise control measures.Thus, the figures given above represent the highest rate of movementsit will be possible to sustain;   in practice if any of the assumptionsmentioned were to be falsified, actual capacity would fall short of these.-1-
Traffic for ec a s ts5.       A careful study of the likely growth of Londonrs air traffic overthe next 15 years has been carried out in conjunction with the Departmentof Economic Affairs.,     The forecasts, which are accepted by bothDepartments, are based in the first place on an analysis of the growth of United Kingdom air traffic which in terms of aircraft movements hasbeen increasing by an average of 8 per cent per annum.    An examinationhas also been made of the total market in the United Kingdom for international travel and the ohare that air transport has occupied,and might in future occupy;   account has been taken of the likely effectof the Channel Tunnel;  and a thorough investigation has been carriedout of the extent to which the development of passenger and freightservices at airports in other regions could relieve the pressure on london,    On this basis three forecasts of air passengers using theLondon airports have been made - forecasts almost certain to be exceeded (the &quot;lower limit&quot;), forecasts unlikely to be exceeded (the&quot;upper limit&quot;), and &quot;most likely&quot; forecasts.     The future size andaverage loading of aircraft have been estimated, including the useof &quot;jumbo&quot; jets, and used to convert the forecasts of passenger trafficinto forecasts of aircraft movements.6,       Table 2 of Appendix 1 shows that, on the most likely forecast oftraffic growth, Heathrow traffic will exceed airport capacity in 1970,By further spreading of peaks and by transferring movements to Gatwick,this date can be put back;  but in the absence of such measures, the thirdairport would have to be in operation by 1969, since at least one year is needed for the orderly transfer of movements to it.Peak spreadinp;7,       For many years now there has been some peak spreading at heathrow, and the problem is to assess how far it is possible to continuethe process of peak spreading and yet offer an adequate service to air-lines and their passengers.    A careful examination has been made ofthis problem by the Board of Trade and the Department of economic affairs, and though this is a subject about which there are necessarilya number of uncertainties, the conclusion is that, against the rate oftraffic increase foreshadowed by the &quot;most likely&quot; forecasts in Table 1of Appendix 1, enforced peak-spreading at Heathrow might postpone theneed for new airport facilities by up to three years.Transfers from Heathrow to Gatwick8,       With two runways Gatwick would, at most, have the potential toaccept five years growth from Heathrow.    How far this potential could in fact be realised cannot be precisely determined at present;  it willhinge upon how far airlines, British and foreign, have scope for movingindividual services, or blocks of services, to Gatwick.     This, in turn,would be affected by the likelihood that in future years these (or other services) would again be moved to a third airport.     Taking these considerations into account transfers of traffic from Heathrow to Gatwickmight put off the need for a third London airport by four years.
Timetable for third London airport9,       By applying these estimated postponements to the date by which anew London airport would otherwise have been required - 1969 - wearrive at a new date of 1976 at the very latest.     Thus the assumptionsmade here about movement rate, peak-spreading, and transfers toGatwick point to the mid-d970s as the time by which a third london airport will be required for a substantial volume of traffic,,    were any of the assumptions invalidated, the date could well come forward to the early 1970s.Ill - THE CHOICE OF S TANS TEDEstuarial sites10,       The main attraction of an estuarial site for london s thirdairport is that in such a site the noise problem caused by the newairport would tend to be less serious because some of the airport&apos;operations could take place over the sea.    However, even a site onthe Thames Estuary, e. g, the Isle of Sheppey, would not permit bothtake-offs and landings to take place over the sea;  consequently, thereis still bound to be a noise problem, though it would indeed be rather less than at an inland site.11,        The possibility of siting London&apos;s third airport somewhere on the thames Estuary was thoroughly considered by the interdepartmental committee on the Third London Airport in 1962-63, at the StanstedPublic Enquiry, and within the last nixie months by an Official Committeechaired by the Department of Economic Affairs (a copy of which isattached at Appendix 2).    It is clear that a major airport for Londoncould be sited at certain places on the Thames Estuary, notably Sheppey,without interfering unduly with traffic using Heathrow or Gatwick,However, surface access would have to be improved at great cost, andwould even then be inferior to access to Stansted;   airports in this area would lead to the closure or severe restriction of Southend Airport;they would entail the removal and replacement of the Ministry of DefenceFiring Range at Shoeburyness;  and the marshy nature of the soil wouldmake airport construction considerably more expensive than at a dryinland site such as Stansted,     Thus, the construction of a third london airport at Sheppey (which has been generally accepted as the best sitein this area) would entail costs in the region of  130 million - nearly three times as much as Stansted,    We could not advise our colleagues that additional costs of this order were in any way justified by the degree to which such a site would relieve the noise problem, use less valuableagricultural land or be less destructive of visual amenities.    (In anycase v/e intend to tackle the noise problem by reducing the noise of theaircraft themselves through the projected noise certification schemeand by appropriate planning of the development of the Stansted area),12.       Luton is not mentioned in the draft White Paper.    It was consideredbut rejected in 1962-63 by the Interdepartmental Committee on the third london Airport, and it was not mentioned at the Stansted Public enquiry as a possible alternative site for the new airport.     The fact is that thedevelopment of Luton as a major London airport could not be achieved without very seriously impeding the flow of traffic in and out of Heathrow,to the extent of cutting Heathrow1 s capacity by nearly a half.     The hillyterrain on which Luton Airport is built would, moreover, prevent theconstruction of even one pair of runways of sufficient length for a majorairport.
CONSrIDENTSAL33dInter-action between airports13.       At our discussion on 13th April it was suggested that, on the analogy of certain groups of airports in the United States, we could inthis country successfully operate airports within a much smaller distance of each other than we have hitherto been willing to contemplate.    It istrue that certain United States airports are separated by as little aseight miles, but they are prisoners of history and are surviving only at a reduced capacity.    Our American colleagues have urged us atall levels to avoid the unsatisfactory situation in which they now find themselves;   and the Federal Aviation Agency, in its search for a sitefor a fourth airport for New York, is adopting distance criteria very similar to our own.     The importance of adequate separation betweenthe new third London airport and the existing London airports is thatthe new airport must be capable of development to its maximum size and capacity without interfering with existing airports so as to put offas long as possible the need for a fourth London airport, which is boundto be  even more difficult to site than the third,Stansted14,       Stansted has many solid advantages;   but it admittedly also hasa number of drawbacks - not least from a planning point of view;  andthese are set out and discussed candidly, along with the advantages, inSection VI of the draft White Paper.    -All the Departments concerned,including the Department of Economic Affairs and the Treasury, have,however, looked thoroughly into the question, and all have concurred in the conclusion that there is no reasonable alternative to the designationof Stansted as London&apos;s third airport.     The noise problem, the loss ofagricultural land, and the other difficulties that Stansted presents are,we are convinced, significantly smaller than the difficulties and problems,particularly the greatly increased cost, presented by each of the manyalternative sites that have been suggested and considered over the years,Silverstone (in Northamptonshire) is the nearest possibility:  but itwould cost up to  100 million to remove the adjacent military airfields:it entails a longer journey to London than Stansted:  and it would not bea good site from the point of view of civil air traffic control,IV - NEED FOR A DECISION15.       Approval for capital investment to begin on the third london airport is not required at this stage, and would only be given when theBoard of Trade and the Treasury are satisfied that the right time had come.    What is needed now is not a decision to build:  but a decision that when we do build it shall be at Stansted.     This decision is requirednow for the following reasons:-(i)  It is over 14 months since the Stansted public enquiry closed andover 10 months since the Government received the Inspector&apos;s report onthe enquiry.     The intervening time has been put to good purpose incarrying out a comprehensive and thorough review resulting in theproposed White Paper, which has been agreed between all theDepartments concerned (Board of Trade, Ministry of housing and Local Government, Department of Economic Affairs, Treasury,Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food),    But Parliamentary and public pressure is growingfor an early announcement;  and, if this is not made soon, theGovernment will receive increasingly unfavourable publicity.
3q iel! JL(ii)   The Inspector who held the Stansted Public Enquiry pointed outthat uncertainty about Stanstedls future was causing hardship amonglocal people wishing to sell their houses,(iii)  Although construction of the new airport will not begin till weare satisfied that it is necessary, we may not have much time before this is so.     The British Airports Authority (who will be responsiblefor providing the new airport) as well as the local planning authoritiesand the airlines need a firm basis for their future planning as soon aspossible,    A clear decision is essential if planning by these bodies isto go ahead,16.       Failure to be ready with new airport facilities when they are needed would be bound to have serious repercussions on our trade,our international position;  and our earnings of foreign exchange from civil aviation.     The French are already going ahead with the constructionof a new major airport for Paris, and will clearly seize any opportunityto increase the status of Paris as an international air traffic centre atthe expense of London.17.       The detailed arguments on all these points, and the detailed examination of all the alternative sites, are included in the white paper (C(67) 50) and the Report of the Official Working Party underDEA chairmanship (Appendix 2).(i)   To agree that, on the best forecasts which can be made oftraffic growth and capacity at the existing London airports, the needfor a third London airport within the foreseeable future is inescapable.(ii)  In view of the thorough study given in recent months to the subject by all Departments concerned and by the Environmental planning committee, to agree to the announcement of a decision to designateStansted as the third London airport and to the issue of the proposedV - CONCLUSION18.V/e therefore invite our collea.gu.es:White Paper (C(67) 50),A, G,Board of Trade, S.

REPORT OF THE STANSTED INQUIRYTHIRD LONDON AIRPORT, WORKING GROUP
NOTE BY THE chairman,     The Minister of Housing and Local Government&quot;and thePresident of the Board of Trade asked that an inter-departmentalWorking Party should he set up to consider the Inspector&apos;sReport of the Public Inquiry into local objections to theproposed development of land, at Stansted,, in Essex, as the thirdairport for London, and to prepare a report to be consideredby Ministers.2,     The work of the Group? set out in detail in the attached report, has shown that:-(a) a third airport within a reasonable distance ofLondon will be required, and it is not practicable to avoid this need by the development of airportsand air services in other parts of the country,,     , *-(Section IV);(b) the third London airport should be developed to cater for short, medium and long haul traffic to every typeof destination,    (Section V);(c) the site should be capable of development to a verylarge size,    (Section V);(d) taking every consideration into account, including all those the Inspector had in mind, Stansted is the bestsite.      Consideration has been given to all the sitesmentioned, at the Inquiry together with other possibilities explored during the work of this Group,(Sections VII and IX),3. As a result of coming to these conclusions the Working Partyare agreed, in advising Ministers that r-(d)   bearing in mind Stansted is the best site, that thereis no likelihood of finding a reasonable alternative9the desirability of a speedy decision and the thorough investigation this matter has already received, theInspectorfs recommendation to have a further review ofthe problem should be rejected;(b)    if Ministers accept this advice a White Paper shouldbe published, simultaneously with the announcement ofthe decision, explaining the Government1s reasons,k.     The Working Party have interpreted the Inspector&apos;recommendation for a further review as meaning a public hearing of some kind conducted, by a Committee whose members   would bemade up mainly of experts drawn from outside the Civil Service,This is implied in the body of the Inspector5s report but his recommendation is worded as follows:-
CONFSDENTSAL3ifIn my opinion the review of the whole problem should beundertaken by a committee equally interested in traffic inthe air, traffic on the ground, regional planning and national planning.      The review should cover military, aswell as civil aviation.&apos;,!5,     The review undertaken by the Working Party, has covered allthese aspects of the problem.     Members of the Group have included representatives of the Department of Economic Affairs,Board of Trade (Civil Aviation Department), Ministry of housing and Local Government, Treasury, Ministry of Transport,Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and Ministry ofDefence (Air Force and Army Departments).     Professional advice hbeen available as and when required, on all the technical aspectsof the work, including, for example, noise, air traffic control,and military flying.      It can, therefore, be stated in theproposed White Paper that the Government1s conclusion has beenreached in the light of a comprehensive review of all the issues raised in the Inspector&apos;s report.(Signed)   A.W.

REPORT OF   THE,  STANSTED INCuIRYTHIRD LONDON AIRPORT, WORKING GROUPI TERMS OF reference .     In the light of the Inspector&apos;s report on the proposalto develop Stansted as the third major airport for london to consider(a)    the need for, and role of, a third London airport;(h)    the advantages and disadvantages in relation toStansted of other feasible sites, especially asregards(i)   air traffic routing and control;(ii)    surface access from London;(iii)   noise nuisance;(iv)   loss of amenity;(v)   loss of agricultural land;(vi)   cost;(vii)    implications for regional planning,(c)   The effect of the relevant factors at (b) on the range at Shoeburyness&apos; and the cost and practicability of transferring it elsewhere;and to report on these matters in sufficient detail to enable ministers to decide on the action to be taken on the Inspector&apos;sreport.II BRIEF HISTORY OF THE STANSTED PROPOSAL2.     At the end of the 1950&apos;s Stansted Airport was being kept in reserve by the Ministry of Aviation in case it was required, as and when the growth of London&apos;s air trafficdemanded the provision of another major airport.     At thetime, however, it was proving expensive to keep this relatively little used airport open and, therefore, the Select Committeeon Estimates, in their fifth report of the session lQ60-6l,recommended that the Ministry of Aviation should take steps todecide whether Stansted was, in fact, the most suitable sitefor a possible third London airport.   As a result, at the endof 1961, an inter-departmental committee of officials - theThird London Airport Committee - was set up to carry out a study of the whole question of the desirability, and possiblesiting of a third airport for London.     The committee reported to the Minister of Aviation in 1963 that such an airportwould be required in the early 1970s and that Stansted, though not ideal, was the best site for it.    The then Government agreed with the Committeefs recommendation and decided that those likelyto be affected by the decision should be given the opportunityto consider and discuss the reasons for the choice of Stansted.1
CONFIDENTIAL 3 41The report of the Committee was published, therefore, in and preparations put in hand for a Public Inquiry to hear, andreport upon, local objections to the proposal.       ^3,    The Inquiry opened on 6th December, 1965 and ended on11th February this year.     Its purpose was defined as:-&quot;to hear and report on local objections relating to the suitability of the choice of Stansted for an airport and the effect of theproposed development on local interests.     It will be open tootgectors to suggest modifications to the outline scheme ofdevelopment or to propose alternative sites, but not to question the need to provide a third major airport to serve London.114,    The principal objectors had suggested to the then Ministerof Aviation, Mr, Roy Jenkins, that the need for a third airportfor London should be included within the scope of the Inquiry,The Minister ruled, however, that this was not an appropriatematter for examination by a local Public Inquiry of this character.5,    The Inspector submitted his report at the end of May thisyear.   The President of the Board of Trade, to whom responsibilityfor civil aviation has now passed, and the Minister of Housing andLocal Government after discussing the best way to proceed, agreedthat in view of the importance and nature, qf the Inspectors report,an inter-departmental committee should be established, under theChairmanship of the Department of Economic Affairs, to make recommendations to Ministers.HI   THE INSPECTORS report it    The terms of reference of the Inspector appointed to conduetthe Stansted Inquiry requested him to &quot;hear and report on localobjections.!!     Objectors were allowed to suggest modifications tothe development scheme or propose alternative sites, but not to question the need for a third London airport.      Objections were raised mainly on the grounds of noise, the effects of the possible level of road traffic, town and country planning including theloss of the district&apos;s rural character, loss of farmland, and declinein house values.      The alternative sites suggested with detailedevidence were Sheppey, Cliffe, Padworth, and Castle Donington.Other alternatives proposed, but with much less detailed evidence,were Foulness, Dengie Flats, Ferrybridge, Gunfleet Sands andPlumstead Marshes.7.    The Inspector came to the conclusion, that to place a majorairport at Stansted &quot;would be a calamity for the neighbourhood&quot;&apos; and&quot;could only be justified by national necessity&quot;:    this &quot;had not beenproved&quot; at the Inquiry.     In his view the proposal succeeded on air traffic grounds but there were strong local arguments against it.The Inspector&apos;s final recommendation was that a review of the whole problem should be undertaken by a committee equally interested intraffic in the air and on the ground, regional and national planning.It should cover military as well as civil aviation.   A detailedsummary is at Appendix 1.%; confidential
9its8.     In general the -Inspector&apos;s report is now-lmpressive.     It(i)    states conclusions without&apos; any convincing assessment of supporting arguments;(ii)    contains little recognition of the disadvantages ofthe other sites mentioned at the Inquiry relative toStansted;(iii)    makes various prejudicial&apos;statements going outsidethe stript terms of reference of the Inquiry, themost important being the implication that a third london airport may not he necessary.     The Inquirywas instructed specifically that this requirementshould not be questioned and accordingly little evidence was offered by the proponents of Stansted onthis point;(iv)    includes a number of relatively minor, butcollectively not unimportant, errors of interpreta-tion of the evidence submitted on behalf of Stansted.It is, therefore, not difficult to produce convincingarguments against the report both in substance and in detail.IV   THE IxTESD FOR A THIRD &quot;LOroOiT&quot; AIRPORT9.    Although Ministers ruled explicitly before the Inquiryopened, that the need for a third London airport could not be examined it was discussed indirectly.     Two of the alternativesites suggested in evidence - Castle Donington and Ferrybridge -were, clearly, only brought under discussion so as to enableobjectors to cast doubt on the necessity for having the airportwithin reasonable distance of London.     On other occasions some have wondered whether it would not be possible to expandHeathrow and Gatwick or have doubted the rate at which air traffic has been assumed to grow.      It is essential to clearthese points up at the outset as they are likely to form thebasis of opposition, in one form or another, to any possiblesite for a new manor international airport, anywhere near london.10.   It is often suggested - the Inspector hinted at thepossibility in his report (paragraphs 1+6 and hi) - that a third london airport would not be needed, or at any rate the needcould be indefinitely postponed;, by the further, and possiblyinduced, development of regional aerodromes and, particularly,air services.     Superficially? this is an attractive propos-ition from the point of view both of London and the mainprovincial centres.     It conflicts, however, with the weight of available evidence much of which might have been presented bythe Ministry of Aviation at the Inquiry had this subject beenwithin the Inspector&apos;s terms of reference.
-)-),   Firstly, it is clear that most of the problems the regionsmay have in respect of civil aviation are connected with air services rather than airports.   Nearly every part of the countryis already provided with good aerodrome facilities which are,except in the case of some of the airports serving London, under-utilised and uneconomic.    It is not technical reasons that preventthe expansion of airport facilities in the provinces.12.   The argument must he, therefore, that provincial air services should he promoted and developed in order to avoid, the need fora third London airport and this in turn relies on the assumptionthat much of London&apos;s present traffic is, in fact, potentialprovincial traffic compelled to pass through the London airportsbecause London is the only centre with the required services.However, the evidence is against this assumption.   A surveyconducted by the Social Survey in 1965, of the origin anddestination in the United Kingdom of international passengerspassing through Heathrow and G-atwick, indicated that as much as80 per cent of London&apos;s international traffic is generated by theLondon conurbation and the south-eastern   counties.    This survey was not conducted on such a scale that its results can be accepted as absolutely conclusive, but the Committee has also received information from other sources which confirms that these findingsare broadly correct.13.   If, then,say 20 per cent of London&apos;s international passengersare generated in regions outside the south-east of Englandthis might amount to a demand for direct services between the regions and, abroad of about one million one-way. seats a year,or 3 million one-way seats a year by 1975*&quot;   In fact, of course,  anumber of the international travellers generated by the regions will always wish to pass through London for personal or business reasons.1U.   It is  therefore,  only the residue that represent the truefrustrated demand for direct air services between regional airportsand abroad.   But theso passengers do not represent demand at anyone regional airport:    they are spread throughout all regions of theUnited Kingdom.   Moreover, the potential demand at each regionalairport is further fragmented because of the very many differentdestinations to which passengers wish to travel.    Thus, most ofthe potential demand for new direct services between regionalairports and. overseas is split up into fragments so small as never,in the foreseeable future, to justify an economic air service.    Itis likely that, at most, a fifth of the total potential demand -say 200,000 one-way passengers now, rising to 600,000 in4
- represents demand that it may he practicable, by one means0r another, to divert from London to regional airports.   Passengerfigures of this order however,  correspond to less than half ofone year&apos;s growth of traffic through London.15,   In short, while there is no doubt that the number of servicesoperating directly between regional airports and overseas willcontinue to increa.se, as in the past, the Committee is agreecl thatthere is no possibility that this factor will make a significantdifference to the need for a third Lo: don airport or the date bywhich it will be required,16,   Apart from the argument discussed and rejected above, the needfor a third . London airport depends fundamentally   on two considerations - the capacity of the existing major London Airports(Heathrow and Gatwick) and the likely growth of the traffic wishing to serve London.17.   The capacity of an airport, in terms of aircraft movements,depends, first, on the number of its runways (particularly parallelrunways) and their dimensions;    secondly on the air traffic controlprocedures in operation (which are governed in turn by the state ofnavigational technology and by considerations of safety);    thirdly,on local factors,  such as the existence of other active aerodromesnearby,  the sensitivity of the surrounding area to noise, etc.Taken together, these considerations point to maximum sustainablecapacities at the existing two London airports by the early yearsof the next decade of 6k aircraft movements (i.e. landings and take-offs) an hour at Heathrow and k5 aircraft movements an hourat Gatwick.18, The figures of capacity given above, however, are based on theassumption that a number of projected developments will take place,,They assume the lengthening of the Number 1 runway at Heathrow andthe construction of a second runway at Gatwick, both of which willbe subject to Public Inquiries before they can go ahead;    they assume the successful operation of now air traffic control procedures,notably the scheme for the independent use of parallel runways at heathrow.,    which have yet to be fully proved;    and they assume onlya certain degree of restriction on the capacity of both airportsarising from noise regulations, though in vie?/ of the acutenessof the noise problem around Heathrow, it cannot be certain thatstill more stringent restrictions will not be necessary.   Thus,although the figures given above represent what is regarded as the likely capacity of these airports in the next decade,  it is by nomeans certain that this can be achieved.5
19.   The next step in assessing the need fqr the third london airport was to produce the most reliable forecasts of thegrowth, of air traffic for London over the next 15 years.      Itwas decided that a sub-group of this Committee, made up largelyof statisticians and economists from the Board of Trade (CivilAviation Department)  and the Department of Economic Affairs?should re-examine this problem in detail.20.   They began by analysing the growth of United Kingdom air traffic in the past and went on to look at the growth of thetotal market in the United Kingdom for international travel andthe share that air transport had occupied, and might in futureoccupy.      On that basis they devised three possible forecasts of air passengers using the London airports - forecasts almost certain to be exceeded,  forecasts unlikely to be exceeded,  andmost likely forecasts.     The future size and average loading of aircraft was estimated,  including the use of &quot;jumbo jets&quot;, andthe forecasts of passenger traffic converted on these assumptions to forecasts of aircraft movements.     The likelydistribution of traffic between Heathrow and Gatwick was thenassessed together with the likely development of the pattern oftraffic at each airport within the year? the week, and the day.The sub-group also took into account the possible effect of theChannel Tunnel on the demand for air travel.21.   All these considerations were elaborated in considerable detail? and the figuring set dov/n? in the report of the sub-group.     Here?  it is sufficient to record that? after careful examination of this data, the Committee are in full agreement that? if the growth of civil air traffic is to be met there isno alternative sooner or later? to the provision of a new&quot;London&quot; airport.     The point in time when it would be best toprovide this airport and, consequently whether there is sufficient time available? putting aside all other considera-tionss for Ministers to accept the Inspector&apos;s final recommenda-tion to have a further review of the problem?  is touched upon in Section X.V.     THE ROLE .0F THE THIRD LONDON AIRPORT22*   In his appendix to the report the Inspector&apos;s technicalassessor suggested that little thought seemed to have beengiven to the possibility of using the projected airport for short haul traffic only.      This possibility, if accepted,would mean that there could be a limitation on the length ofrunways required and, therefore, other sites than those mentioned at the Inquiry could come into consideration (see the inspector&apos;s report Appendix 1? paragraph 117).     This opinion6
contrasts strangely with another the technical assessorexpressed:    that the site for the third London airport mustbe capable of Toeing enlarged (see paragraph k5 of Appendix 1to the report).      In fact much thought has &quot;been given to the role of the proposed airport,2.3.   Apart from Heathrow the United Kingdom possesses only two airports planned to cater for all kinds of long hauloperations - Prestwick and Manchester0     For London and theSouth East generally there is another major airport at Gatwick,tut apart from diversions it is suitable only for short and medium haul traffic,    Gatwick&apos;s present runway is considerablyshorter than the main runway at Heathrow and, though it can beextended, the topographical features of the site will neverallow it - or the- projected second runway - to accept all kinds of long haul traffic without restrictions.     This means that the role of Gatwick will continue to be that of an airport for short and medium haul services and for diversions.      Its position southof London makes it eminently suitable to cater for the numerousservices of this type between London and western Europe02lw   The density of development around Heathrow and the noiseproblem arising from its particular situation, makes it virtually impossible to develop Heathrow further by the construction ofadditional parallel runways.    Thus, when Heathrow becomessaturated, more and more of its growing traffic will have to betransferred to Gatwick and (later) to the third London airport.If neither Gatwick nor the third airport were able to takelong-haul aircraft, the whole of the transfer would consist of short and medium haul services.      This would progressively upset the balance of services that continue to be provided at Heathrow,turning it increasingly into an exclusively long haul airport.The effects of this would be 1-(a) interlining facilities at Heathrow would be progressively reduced;(b) the inevitable moves from Heathrow by airlinesoperating short-haul services to one of the otherLondon airports would be even more unpopular thanotherwise.      In that situation retaliation must beexpected a gainst our national airlines in foreign count(c) traffic growth at the London airports would be stuntedbecause long and short-haul services act as feedersto one another and some passengers would prefer tointerline at, say, Paris and Amsterdam rather thansuffer the inconvenience of long journeys betweenLondonJs airports;7
(d) the revenues of airlines using London - notablyof course, British airlines - would suffer and so,consequently, would the revenues of the british airports Authority;(e) passengers having no other choice open to them wouldhave to travel between the London airports, therebyadding unnecessarily to ground congestion;(f) all this would reduce London&apos;s attractiveness as aninternational air traffic centre and interchange point and would probably have long term adverse effects onour tourist trade0These factors would have a particularly severe impact only.E.A. as an exclusively short-and medium-haul airline.     B.E.A.has a large capital investment in Heathrow, which it would be costlyto reprovide elsewhere,25o   For all these reasons, and to provide the greatest flexibilityfor the organisation of London1s air traffic as far ahead aspossible, the third London airport should he multi-purpose(i,e. it should cater for long, medium and short haul services).A multi-purpose airport also needs to be able to cater efficientlyfor traffic to all points of the compass, or as near that idealas practicable.26.   Apart from these considerations, the great difficulties experienced in providing and agreeing a site for a third london airport make it imperative that this third airport should be capable of development to the largest feasible capacity that air traffic control safety margins and techniques will allow.    Ifthis is done then the possible problem of looking for a site fora fourth London airport will be postponed for a long time ahead,27,   The Committee are ajgreed, therefore, that the need is foran airport to take as wide a range of traffic as possible with as much capacity as is feasible.      There is, accordingly,no point in looking for a site for a smaller airport than that proposed for Stansted :l,e. capable of an ultimate development ofthree parallel runways.      If at all possible the site chosenshould be one where four parallel runways are practicable.VI     STANSTED28.   The case made by the Inspector  against Stansted has been summarised in Appendix 1 and his most damagingobjection, that the provision of a third &quot;London&quot; airportmay not be a matter of national necessity, disposed ofin Sections TV:- and V.     Having agreed that a large,multi-purpose international airport must be established in the foreseeable future reasonably close to London, the 8
Committee considered, against the Inspector&apos;s detailed objections,whether Stansted could remain a strong candidate.   From this examination it became clear, that, Stansted must remain one of theprincipal candidates and its merits are compared with others that have a claim for consideration in Sections VII and IX.    It isnecessary, however, to counter the Inspector&apos;s detailed points and this is also done in Appendix 1.   &apos;If, in the event, Ministersdecide to reject the Inspector&apos;s recommendation and proceed withthe development at Stansted without a further review, this material would form an important part of the public defence of thedecision.VII   THE OTHER SITES TO BE CONSIDERED29,   The sites mentioned at the Public Inquiry, apart fromStansted, were: -Castle Donington (about 8 miles South East of Derby)Ferrybridge (near Pontefract, Yorkshire)Gunfleet Sands (in the North Sea, 5 miles off Clacton)Dengie Flats (Essex coast)Foulness (Essex coast, near Southend)Isle of Sheppey (Kent)Cliffe Marshes (Thames Estuary, Kent)Plumstead Marshes (East London)Padworth (about 8 miles South West of Reading)As well as reconsidering those, the Committee have also examined the merits of a virgin site midway between London and Birminghamin the vicinity of Silverstcne about 13 miles south west ofNorthampton, and Bedford (Thurleigh)  aerodrome, 8 miles north ofBedford, neither of which was mentioned at the Inquiry.    the relation of these sites to London can be scon on the map at appendix 2.30.   The sites can bo divided into two groups;-(a) Those which do not require detailed comment to showthat they are inferior to Stansted.(b) The few which require detailed comparative examinationas serious possibilities.    Stanstod, Sheppey andSilverstone are the sites in this group.ffilgile^ Dpnington and Ferrybridge31.   Those two proposals were not put forward during the Inquiry asserious possibilities for a third &quot;London&apos;&apos; airport but to serverather as pretexts for advancing the argument that the need for thethird London airport should be avoided by building up the air services serving the main provincial cities.    This argument isdismissed in Section IV above.    It is clear, as the Inspector
recognised, (paragraphs 28 and 77 of his Report).,, that both theselocations are much too far from London to serve as &quot;London&quot;airports and, therefore, they must be rejected.,ffnrifleet Sands  -32,   The Committee agrees with the Inspector&apos;s technical assessorthat it would be impracticable to site a third London airport atGunfleet Sands.    The site is five miles out to sea;    constructionwould be very costly and present enormous and possibly insuperableproblems.    It is also more than 60 miles from Central London and access would be difficult.Denffie;Flats, Foulness, Sheppey and Cliffe - (These sites can be grouped together conveniently as the^^^TOiames Estuary&quot; sites.)33.   The fact that Foulness,  Sheppey and Cliffe are situated onlow lying, marshy ground near the Thames Estuary means, on the onehand, that the land, is of little value for alternative purposes,but on the other, that the construction of an airport would be moredifficult and expensive than on a dry inland site,    Dengie Flatsis similar to Gunfleet Sands in that the proposed site is atpresent situated in the sea, and the same problems of cost and difficulty of construction would arise.    Dengie Flats, Foulness,Cliffe, and Sheppey would entail the removal of the firing rangeat Shoeburyness.   The selection of Foulness would also mean the.complete closure of Southend airport while the selection of theother three would very severely restrict its use by passenger services.    The site at Cliffe is too restricted to accommodate an airport of more than two parallel runways of the separationnecessary to achieve maximum capacity,    Sheppey on the other handcould accommodate three or four parallel runways.    Cliffe is alsotoo far west to be able to function completely independently ofHeathrow from the air traffic control point of view with the effectthat the combined capacity of the two airports would be less than their potential separate capacities.    The Committee is satisfiedthat,, of these Thames Estuary sites, Sheppey is the most promisingand have therefore chosen it for more detailed consideration below, lMg.tead Marshes3h.   Plumstead Marshes suffers from the same drawbacks as Cliffe,hut to a much greater degree.    It is also in the Committee&apos;s view,and that of the Inspector, too near London.    It is very close todensely populated areas and a major airport there would, encounteran acute noise problem from the verjr beginning.Padwortli35.   This site received a good deal of attention at the Inquiry.Its position in relation to Heathrow however is such that on morethan hO per cent of occasions (governed by the strength and direction of winds) operations on parallel runways, would approach10
or overlap with those of Heathrow to an extent incompatible with reasonable safety.    In addition, a civil airport at Padworth wouldhave a serious effect upon military flying in Central southern england, and would necessitate the reprovision of a wide range of facilities at a very large cost.    The choice of Padworth would alsomean the closure of the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment a$Aldermaston and the cessation of flying operations at the Roy^lAircraft Establishment at Farnborough.    The noise problem wouldte likely to be worse than at Stansted.   For all these reasons,Padworth must be ruled out as a site for a third London airport.Sllvcrstcne and Bedford36.   These sites were not discussed at the Inquiry, but we understandthat Bedford may become available for civil use during the next decade and Silverstone is chosen as an illustrative example of a &apos;site on the London/Birmingham axis.    Such a site would haveadvantages from the point of view of ground access northwards andwestwards.   Thus it would be situated in a central position tocater for the traffic not directly dependent upon London.    Itwould also have other broad planning advantages discussed in detailbelow.   It must be emphasised, however, that Silverstone is being used here merely as an illustration of a possible London/Birmingham site.   Bedford, though it might cause somewhat lessextensive interference with military flying than Silverstone,does not have, to the same degree, the planning advantages of silver stone.   Silverstone is chosen, therefore, for detailed consideration.vni   GENERAL PROBLEMS OF AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL37.   Tho three sites which are practicable possibilities for a third London airport are, therefore, Stansted, Sheppey andSilverstone, using Silverstone as an illustration of a possiblesite on the London/Birmingham axis.   Before going on to comparethese three sites it is necessary to explain briefly the implications that air traffic control problems hold for the siting of a third London airport.    The siting of an airport which eventuallywill be at least the size of Heathrow presents air traffic controlproblems of such complexity that the choice of areas around london is severely limited.38,   The third London airport must be located in relationto the other London airports and other major civil airports, so thatthey can all operate to their designed capacity and a viable pattern of air routes can be created.   At the same time,  the third london airport must be located so that the demand it makes for11
additional controlled air-space causes the minimum conflict with the operational requirements of the military and otherusers of uncontrolled airspace.39,   In order that take-offs and landings at the new airportcan he made independently of take-offs and landings at other major airports, the new airport must &quot;be separated from theseoy some 30 to hO miles depending on their relative positions.(Gatwick is 25 miles from Heathrow and is too close ever tobecome a high-capacity airport-)      The airspace around the airport must he fully controlled, so that other traffic does not interfere with the free flow of aircraft taking off and landing.    Outside this immediate airspace, areas have to beprovided in which aircraft can be &quot;held&quot; - that is, can flyaround in a race-track pattern - whenever airport congestioncauses landing delays.     These areas have to be clear of allroutes, and are some 20 miles across.     For a major airport,several holding areas have to be provided.      Outside theimmediate vicinity of the airport, routes have to be providedjoining the runways to the main air routes.      These linkroutes must be one-way, because separate routes arerequired for arriving and departing aircraftj    they haveto be provided for both directions of use of a runway;and have to be planned so that changes in direction canreadily be made.    A sufficient number of routes has to beprovided to accommodate the planned flow, with a lateralseparation between any two routes of some seven miles.    Theinbound and outbound routes from a number of airports tothe many destinations they serve must inevitably cross;and the crossings must, so far as is possible, be engineeredso that aircraft will naturally be at different heights0Where this is not possible, crossings must%be so located that control can be effectively exercised.    The routeing problem is complicated by the need to provide routes for throughtraffic and for traffic from the less important airports whichare situated close to the main airports.    Because of theneeds of the military and other users of the airspace,   theamount of controlled airspace has to be limited to much less than is desirable to provide the optimum organization ofroutes from the airline and A.T.C. point of view.     Thisincreases the problem of finding a satisfactory location for thethird airport,  * A: also.   The military A.T.C. requirement varies considerablyaccording to the type of aircraft and the operationalrole.     In common with civil airfields, all important military airfields require airspace in which approaches and departures can be made without conflict from traffic
using other airfields or following air routes.    The precise areasrequired vary with the role,    Transport aircraft requirements aresimilar to those of airline aircraft;    while fighters, with theirvery high rates of climb, require freedom of movement to muchgreater heights close to airfields.    Common to all OperationalCommands is the need to he able to move many aircraft in a very short time and at short notice.    Training aircraft presentadditional problems, since once away from airfields,  they are hotin general susceptible to control *41,   The application of these general principles to the selection of a third London airport site, leads, on the basis of routerequirements, to a site somewhere between the London/birmingham and the London/Margate axes and in order to avoid reducing the capacity of Heathrow it should, be sited outside a line which runsbroadly through Brachley-Nofthampton-Bedford-Bishops Stortford-Chelmsford-Chatham-Polkestone,    The effect of the third london airport on military operations will depend on how far the trafficpatterns associated with it penetrate into the north-east quandrant0IX.    COMPARlgSPN^OF&apos; THE PRINCIPAL ALTERNATIVE SITESL2.   The three sites which are serious possibilities are nowcompared in detail taking all the relevant factors into account.Air Traffic Control-Civil FlyingU3p   The Inspector- acknowledged that the case for Stansted on air traffic control grounds was convincing*   Stansted has theadvantage that it is just far enough away from Heathrow to operateindependently both of that airport and of Gatwick.    It is also well placed to serve a wide variety of directions without hamperingHeathrow from doing the same- and without involving the necessitylistof awkward crossings of air routes or circuitous &quot;by-pass&quot; routes,Sheppey has similar advantages, hut it not quite so good because it is closer against the very busy air lanes south-east of Londonand it is also closer to the boundaries of our national air space.Sheppey would also have the disadvantage of severely restricting the use of Southend airport hy regular passenger services most ofwhich would have to be accommodated elsewhere (Southend is the;country5s fourth busiest airport in terms of passenger movements).It would not, however, be good air traffic control planning tosite a new major airport at Silverstone, although it would probablyoe possible to devise a workable system if other considerations wereoverwhelmingly in the site!s favour.    The results of siting a third london airport at Silverstone would be to complicate and lengthenthe air traffic routes between Heathrow and Gatwick and the northand, probably, to restrict the capacity of Birmingham Airport.13

As they are14
weil-fcmnd airfields on which substantial money has already been spent, and because of the virtual impossibility of findingsuitable replacements for them,  the Ministry of Defence considerthat the eight airfields mentioned above will be required for flying use for the foreseeable future.      On the hypothesis,however, that suitable alternatives could be found, and the consequential disruption to military, plans accepted, the costof replacement would be anything up to  100 million, with a lossof assets of about the same order.il8.    In addition to the direct effect on airfields, almostany site on the London-Birmingham axis would mean the extensionof controlled airspace across the Midlands and East Angliawhich would seriously hamper military movement between thesouth and west of the country and the rest.     This would createcongestion and risk at crossing points, treble the requirement for air-traffic control equipment and staff, and produce anincrease of about 30 per cent in military activity withinthe remainder of the airspace still uncontrolled,.19.   The Stansted site was proposed as the best site forthe reason, among others, that interference with military flying was limited.    Since this proposal was provisionallyaccepted the Ministry of Defence has planned accordingly.Terrain and, ,Sizjb50.    It is clear that the site chosen for the third london airport should be capable of development to a very largecapacity.     It was envisaged at the Public Inquiry thatStansted would have, initially,  two parallel  runways ofapproximately 12,000 ft, long, separated by 6,000 ft.,which would provide the same capacity as it Is hoped to achieve at Heathrow, i.e., a sustainable hourly capacity of6h aircraft movements.     Later a third parallel runway,another 6,000 ft. away, might be built to a shorter length,thus raising capacity to around 90 to 100 movements an hour.     Recent studies by the Board of Trade  (CivilAviation Department) suggest that it v/ould probably be practical to achieve even higher capacities of about 130movements an hour.     This would be clone bjr providing two additional parallel runways one on each side of the first pairand separated from it by at least 1,000 ft., rather than anisolated third parallel.     Three or four runway systems ofthese kinds can be provided at Sheppey and at Stansted,  thoughat Sheppey the marshy and low-lying nature of the ground wouldmake the work considerably more expensive than at Stansted.A similar system could possibly be provided at Silverstone but onlyhy evacuating part or the whole of two or three villages.15
w tS t$51.   There arc two obstacles in assessing the degree of noisenuisance likely to be experienced in the area surrounding thethird London airport.   Firstly, no one knows, precisely, how noisyaircraft aircraft will be in ten or twenty years time,  or how farair traffic control procedures will have changed.    It is assumedhere, as it was at the Stanstod Inquiry, that the aircraft operating in twenty years time will be as noisy but no more so,than long and medium haul jots in operation today.    It is alsoassumed that their technical characteristics and the air traffic control procedures in force will not make the noise of these aircraft, at similar positions in relation to the airport, lessaudible on the ground than they are today.    Secondly, it is not easy to measure objectively the effect of noise on people.    Themost scientific method available is that developed by the WilsonCommittee on noise in its examination of the noise around Heathrow.On this basis areas have been identified around Heathrow that are subject to noise levels classed by the Wilson Committee as unacceptable or nearly so.   A corresponding area has been estimated for the sites under consideration for a time when they might be operating at near the full    capacity of two parallel runways(l.e. not before the late 1980s).    It has been assumed that thepopulation in the area in question remains the same as at present.Thus it is estimated that at Stansted about 3,000 houses or ,000 people lie within the area that will at that time be subjectto a high degree of noise nuisance.    Here it must be emphasised that the people who will be attracted by the employment offered bythe airport, and any associated developments, need not add to thetotal number of people that will be affected by a high degree ofnoise nuisance.    This is because the area around an airport whichis subject to this degree of noise has the shape of an elongatedoval with the points of the oval pointing in the direction of thetake off and landing areas - see the diagrams at Appendix 3*    Thusany new development associated with an airport can be so situatedas to be largely free of noise.    It is simplest to present the data for the various sites in the form of indices related to thepopulation affected.RejLatiye Extent of Noise Huisance at ^Various SitesStansted     ) All jet traffic at a standard 1busy rate of 6k movements14Sheppey       ) an hour (not before thelate 1980s apart fromSilvorstone) Heathrow when it will2be some time after 1970)Heathrow     ) about 2016

It is impossible to be precise about journey times between central London and the alternative sites during all parts of theday in the mid-1 970s because of uncertainties about the rate of road improvement and the growth of road traffic.    In particular,it is difficult to foresee the amount and direction of the trafficthat will be generated by the airport itself.   And it is uncertainho?/ much of the traffic generated including employees and visitorsas well as passengers, will use the roads rather than rail and what proportion of road users will travel in private vehicles or public transport.   However, the Ministry of Transport have provided tentativeestimates of journey times between central London and thealternative sites.    The route to Stansted would be via the M.11(the section in question is likely to be completed by 1972) and the journey time would be about 70 minutes.   A short link road wouldbe necessary to connect the airport with the motorway.   the journey to Sheppey would be via the M.2 and would take about100 minutes,   A rather longer link road would be required.   the journey to Silverstone would bo via the M.1, would require a linkroad and would take about 100 minutes.   All these journey times are estimated on the basis of travel at off-peak periods.    By the mid-1970s though there will probably be congestion on the M.11it is likely to be considerably greater on the M.1  and M.2 unless a decision is taken in the meantime to provide new supplementaryroutes.   However, some relief to the M.1 could be obtained by use ofan improved A.5, and. the Ministry of Transport are also consideringthe possibility of supplementing the M.1 for London/Birminghamtraffic by building a new road along the line London/Aylesbury/Brackley.   Silverstone would of course be directly accessible fromthe Midlands - it would lie close to the centre of the developedmotorway system.    Stansted, however, would be better from thispoint of view than Sheppey.    In fact one of the major disadvantages of Sheppey is its relative isolation from the rest of the country,apart from South East London and Kent.17
Rail Access53.   In view of the large volume of traffic likely to begenerated by a third London airport, to which must be addednormal traffic growth wherever an airport Is sited it must,in the Committee&apos;s view, be provided with a direct railconnection to London in addition to good road access.     Railjourney times given in this paragraph are applicable tojourneys terminating at a notional air terminal at Victoria.On this basis Stansted could be brought within an hour&apos;sjourney by train from Victoria by the provision of a spurbetween the airport site and the present main line at BishopsStortford.    It v/ould be costly to provide rail access toSheppey because of the length of the spur required and the need to eliminate the bottlenecks in the present main line system in that sector,    For these reasons It would only be possibleto provide a journey time of 70-75 minutes to Sheppey ata cost of some  hO million,     Silverstone could probably bebrought within 75 minutes rail journey of Victoria by a spurfrom the site to the London Midland Region&apos;s electrified mainline.     If it were not thought necessary to have a commonterminal for all three airports, then Stanstecl would beaccessible to Kings Cross in less than an hour and Silverstoneto Euston in an hour.     As with road access Silverstone wouldalso have the advantage that passengers from the West midlands and North West could travel by electrified line direct to the airport without going first to London.,Agri cultural Land5h.   A major international airport requires a large area of open land, and within an acceptable radius of London virtually allsites of this character are in some kind of agricultural use.It is inevitable, therefore, that wherever -&apos;*the airport issited a substantial acreage of land will have to go out ofagricultural production.      The only exception to this would be oneof the very marshy sites situated on the Thames Estuary or coast,and these have already been rejected because of other considerations of the airport sites under discussion here,  Stansted has thehighest agricultural value, while Silverstone is in an area where much of the agricultural land is about the national averagein qu-Tliiv..     Sheppey has the lowest quality agricultural land of the three sites.     The more important loss of agricultural land, however, comes with the development of housing and other services associated with the airport.      It is estimated thatto meet these requirements upv/ards of 100,000 people will need to be established in the vicinity of the new airport18
over the course of time and, of course, this scale of developraentwill cause much more loss of agricultural acreage than the airport itself.      On the &quot;basis of an overall urban density ofsome 12 people to the acre a development of this size wouldinvolve the loss of some 8-g- thousand acres of land.      this figure could be somewhat reduced, perhaps,  if it proved bothpossible and desirable to attach part of this development toone or more existing towns.     Here Silverstone shows up toadvantage.      The big development at North Bucks and the planned expansion at Northampton are to be established some10 to 15 miles from the site.      Some of the employmentgenerated directly and indirectly by the airport could be accomodated at these planned expansions and, therefore,the loss of agricultural land would be minimised.     AtSheppey, though the land on the island is not of high quality,it seems doubtful whether a large planned development could be built with the airport on the island itself, and it would haveto spill over into the North Kent mainland.      Here the quality ofthe land is exceptionally high and the cost to agriculture would be correspondingly more serious.      Stansted is surroundedby high quality agricultural land and any associated development would add to the loss of that land as no planned expansion isgill &apos;&apos;&quot;&apos;:&apos;&apos;   &apos; &apos; &apos; --.envisaged at present for the area.     Thus from the point ofview of the total loss to agricultural land arising from the airport site together with the planned expansion, in bothquantity and quality, Silverstone is well ahead.     Against this,if lower (such as Sheppey) rather than higher quality land is used somje loss of agricultural production must still occur.Secondly, and more important, the national advantages likelyto be obtained from building a major international airporton the best site can fairly be regarded as out-v/eighing thepossible agricultural- loss from any land concerned.&apos;Amenity55.   This is one of the more complex factors to discusssensibly as it is not easily subject to any form of quantitative evaluation.     FAirthermore, it is notoriouslydifficult to arrive at an objective view about the worth of a particular piece of landscape or the architectural merit ofdifferent villages and towns..      However for the purposes of this discussion it is clear that no matter what the intrinsic worth ofa particular green area may be,, it becomes more valuable the closerit is to a large urban area.      This indeed.&quot; is the&apos;.true amenityvalue of the green belt.     Against this background it can beseen that Sheppey scores as it does not possess great merit asa piece of landscape.     Silverstone is an ordinary English19
Midland agricultural landscape, but is well away from the very largeurban areas.    S tans tod. airport, on the other hand.,  is near to the urban mass of London (the nearest site of all, which from the pointof view of access is its major advantage).    It is situated, justbeyond the proposed extensions of the London green belt (not yetconfirmed by the Minister).    The evidence at the Inquiry, which wasnot-seriously contested, was that the&apos;area had a considerabledegree of natural beauty and the villages and. towns nearby had much architectural merit.    These   intrinsic   merits are enhanced bythe area&apos;s proximity to London.    On the other hand, it could boargued that any damage caused to this landscape by the airport andits associated development, could be minimised, by careful planning.The best of the landscape, villages and small towns could be preserved, and in any event, places as near as this to London must expect to find, over the course of time as the population increases,that their rural character is altered.    It may well be better forthe area, from the amenity point of view, that growth should be concentrated, in one place rather than allowed to spread more widelyin response to inevitable pressures.    Summing up, it is clear thatSilverstone and Sheppey are better sites on grounds of amenity thanStansted., although Stansted need not necessarily suffer grievouslyif the development were carefully planned.Implications for Regional Planning56.   Here the sites must be viewed against the general planningstrategy for the South East.    One of the basic aims of the strategy for the planned distribution of population and industry discussedfirst in the South East Study, and. reinforced in the review of thatStudy undertaken by the present Administration, was that further development in the ring of post-war now towns some 30-h.O milesround London should be limited.    There were two main reasons behindthis thinking.    First, the Outer Metropolitan Region, in which those new towns are situated (Bishops Stortford is in the O.M..R,and Stansted on the edge), is growing and is expected to continue to grow at the fastest rate of any region in the country in terms ofDoth population and employment.    It seemed, better to avoid adding,if possible, to that growth by further planned expansions.    Second,further schemes for planned expansions by adding to the growth of the outer Metropolitan Region might make it more difficult to findindustry to go to the very large new towns proposed elsewherearound the edge of the South East region and for the industrialregeneration of the development areas.    The Government has a verylarge programme of such planned expansions, much larger than at any
other time in our history, and success in catering for the growth in population and London overspill depends on their attractingindustry.    It is by no means certain that there is sufficient mobileindustry to serve the needs of both the planned expansion schemes and the development areas over the next decade or so and there areadvantages therefore in locating large employment generators ofthe magnitude of this airport near to either an existing planned expansion or a place where a new expansion would fit in with generalplanning strategy;    It was decided therefore that the further largeplanned expansion schemes needed should he situated well outsidethe Outer Metropolitan Region.    As a result there are proposals and feasibility studies in hand for very large expansions at such places as Ipswich, Northampton, Peterborough, North Bucks.,Swindon, Southampton/Portsmouth and Ashford in a ring some 70 to100 miles from London.    The test that should be applied to a sitefor this particular project is whether or not it fits in with this general strategy, not because of the size of the airport itselfor the land it will occupy, but primarily because of its importance as an employment generator, traffic focus and basis fora large planned expansion scheme.    Applying these principles tothe sites the result is:-(a) Stansted lies in roughly the same relationship toLondon as the early post-war new towns,   A planned expansion scheme nearby would acid therefore to the veryfast growth of population and employment in the outer metropolitan Region.    It would also cut into a valuablerural landscape barrier between London and the majorexpansions taking place in East Anglia.    The area wouldnot be considered for planned, expansion if the airporthad not been mooted.(b) Sheppey has not been selected, for one of the very large-expansions as a result of the work done on the Review ofthe South East Study.    It does not therefore have positiveplanning advantages at the moment.    On the other hand it is a possibility for a planned expansion schemedesigned to take about 30,000 Londoners.    There must be considerable doubt, however, ?/hcther the island couldaccommodate both a major airport and the population growth it is likely to generate.21
(c)    Silverstone has potential economic and physical planningadvantages.    It v/ould fit in with the general sweep of regional planning for the region, if a site could Toofound near enough to the planned expansions In theNorth Bucks, and Northampton area for the employmentgenerated by the airport to he geared to these expansions.They are of such a size that they would not be whollydependent upon the airport for employment opportunities.At the same time a large number of jobs v/ould be providedwhich should help to make this group of expansions a success.    The airport would also encourage the growth ofother industries which, like to be situated near a largeairport and its existence v/ould help to attract industryout of the London conurbation.    To the extent that the airport gave rise to new employment it would leave more of the pool of mobile Industry available for deploymentelsewhere.    The investment required for roads would fit in well with the general regional strategy, and would&quot;help to serve other national economic purposes.   Forexample,  although it might be necessary to bring forward-AA/^athe construction of a new road along the London-Aylesbury-Brackley-Birmingham line this would have theadditional virtue of Improving communications between london and the industrial areas of the Midlands.Shocburvness FiringiRange57.   Sheppey alone of the throe sites now being considered, is affected by the existence of the Ministry of Defence Firing Range&apos;at Shoeburyness and its associated danger area.    The situation ofthe range is such that aircraft using an airport at Sheppey mustnecessarily fly close to it v/hen landing and taking-off.    Thoughmeasures could be taken which would enable higher-altitude firingsto be concentrated within a smaller area which would reducelAAi:&quot;fa% V. ;       f-wA.:. :&apos;y^^y        .: R&apos;-Av-&apos; Pm:ia,a^i-;afa - a    -::,:J; ;t;substantially the effective extent of the danger area,  the presenceSisok the range v/ould inevitably limit the capacity of the airport msome degree whether it was provided with two or four parallelrunways.   A major airport at Sheppey operating to full capacitywould involve,  at best, restricting the range danger area to aheight of 1,000 ft. in the outer areas and 5,000 ft.  in the inner area, and v/ould moan that 75 por cent of the present work at the Range could no longer be carried out.    It would almost22
certainly be uneconomic to continue to use the remainingfacilities and it is probable therefore that the entire rangefacilities would have to be reprovidod elsewhere.    The capital cost of doing so would be of the order of  25 million.Coatjl58.   An assessment has been attempted of the cost of providing a two-runway airport at each of the throe sites.    The results are given in the following table:-23

It also excludesxpendlture by the Government - on navigation services - and by tire airines - e.g., on maintenance facilities.   The purpose ox including aentative figure is simply to put the other costs enxailed by each snento perspective. ]21).
Stansted,, therefore, would he the cheapest of the sites to develop,Sheppey and Silverstone costing probably more than twice as much.Silverstone!s extra cost arises very largely from the disruptionany airport along the London/Birmingham axis would cause R.A.F.deployments.    If this factor is ignored Stansted is still the cheapest site.    It should, also be noted that, whereas the bulk ofthe expenditure on Stansted would be incurred by the british airports Authority, who, with their statutory duty to pay their way, could be expected to earn from the users a reasonable return on the investment, the extra expenditure entailed by the choice of Sheppey or Silverstone would largely fall directly on theExchequer.    To the extent, that this additional cost fell on nationalised industries (e.g. B.A.A.., British Rail), those industries would doubtless insist that because the decision to select themore expensive site was the Governments,  the Government should pay any extra costs.Summary of the Comparative Merits of .jthe. Three Alternative Sites59,   The discussion above points towards the following conclusions:-(a) Sheppey is good or reasonably so from a number of angles(military air traffic control, area of land available,noise,  loss to agriculture and to amenity).    It has somenegative advantages from the point of view of regional planning.    But the cost of providing both road and railaccess would be very large:    even then access would bepoor in terms of journey times.    The probable closure of Shoeburyness range and the virtual closure of Southendairport would add to the costs of an already expensive site.(b) Silverstone&apos;s advantage is on grounds of regional planning and it has positive virtues from the point of view of direct access from other regions.    It is also better thanStansted for loss of amenity and agricultural land and rather better for noise.    On the other hand access from london is rather less good than for Stansted, it is not good from the point of view of diyil air traffic controland very bad in its effect on military flying.    This latterfactor would make Silverstone a very expensive site todevelop overall.    It must also be remembered that the suitability of the Silverstone site for a full capacityfour runway airport is still doubtful in the absence of afull study.(c) Stansted scores best for civil air traffic control anaroad and. rail access from London.    It is also acceptablein its effect on military flying, for suitability ofterrain, and for the noise problem.    It is clearly aheadon overall cost.    Its least satisfactory features are lossof amenity and agricultural land and its shortcomings inrespect of the objectives of regional planning.
60.   The Committee agree that Sheppey&apos;s grave defects ofaccessibility and. high real costs rule it out, at this stage, for a third London airport.    The Committee also agree that the regional planning and other advantages of Silverstone cannot justify the selection of this site in view of its grave drawbacks, notably the effects its selection must have on military flying and. the verylarge extra costs this would necessarily entail.    Thus after a thorough examination of all the evidence the Committee are satisfiedthat Stansted is the best site available.X      THE ADVISABILITY og HAVING A FATHER rhQuIRY61.   The Minister of Housing and Local Government has already announced in reply to a Parliamentary Question that the Report ofthe Stansted Inquiry will be published.    In view of its contentsthere can be no doubt that if Ministers do not accept the inspector&quot; s recommendation that there should be a further detailedreview of possible sites for a third London airport, they must expect criticism both in Parliament and outside.62.   The Committee are satisfied that there is no likelihood thata further review would load to the discovery of a better site thanStansted.    The London/Birmingham axis is the only area which offersany possibility of finding a site with some of the advantages thatStansted lacks.    But it is equally clear that this broad area, andany sites It may contain, has severe disadvantages from the pointof view of military flying which could only be surmounted, if atall, at great coot.63,   The Committee have also considered whether there would bepresentational advantages in having a further review, on theassumption that this would inevitably lead to the conclusion thatStanstcd is the best available site.    They cannot, however,recommend this course, for the following reasons.6k.   The most important consideration is that the implications formilitary flying of any site along the London/Birmingham axis couldnot be discussed in full detail in public for reasons of security.An independent review body, not being in a position to evaluate the military difficulties, might well recommend a site similar toSilverstone, along this axis, which the Government would have to reject.    In that event, in two or three years time a controversyeven more violent would be provoked and nothing would have been gained.65.   A further argument against having another review is that itmust inevitably take up a good deal of time.    While this Committeehas not been asked to decide when the third London airport oughtto be ready to receive a substantial volume of traffic,  it hasdiscussed in detail the growth of traffic in relation to capacityat Heathrow and Gatwick (see Section IV).   Further work is required26
to determine more accurately ?/hen the&apos; new airport should heconstructed in order to earn the host return on investment.However, from the Committee!s preliminary examination of this problem, it is apparent that if a further review of the siting of the airport were held there is a risk (some would say aconsiderable risk) that it would curtail unacceptably the time available for providing the third London airport.66,   Again, one of the original reasons for choosing the Stanstedsite was that interference with military flying was limited.Ministry of Defence planning has since taken this possibilityinto account and work on military deployments must for the mostpart go ahead regardless of a final decision on the airport site.But some money could be spent more prudently if an early decision were taken.67.   Finally,  a quick decision is also desirable in the interestsof those who live near Stansted.    Even if Ministers accepted the inspector&apos;s recommendation they would clearly feel bound toretain Stansted as a possible site, thus further prolonging theperiod of uncertainty.68.    To sum up, bearing in mind the lack of any real alternative to Stansted;    the difficulties of expounding the full case in public against a site on the London/Birmingham axis;    the dangersthat the timetable for the third London airport may be jeopardisedand the general desirability of a speedy decision, the Committeeare agreed in advising that Ministers should reject therecommendation to have a further independent review.69.    If Ministers accept this advice the Committee consider, thatin order to make the Governments case as clear and persuasive aspossible, a White Paper should be published at the same time asa decision letter is sent to the objectors, in which the case for rejecting the InspectorTs report is explained as fully aspossible.27
APPENDIX II.     SUMMARY OF THE INSPECTOR&apos;S ARGUMENTS(This section merely states the Inspector&apos;s views and inno way comments on them.     The Inspector&apos;s scattered remarksare arranged into a logical pattern, and in the process his views may have been somewhat sharpened,,)i.     The Inspector followed two lines of approach towards theproblem.     On the one hand he outlined the main criteria thatin his view a new major airport should ideally meet and on theother he considered Stansted and the alternatives that were put to him in the light of these criteria and of the local objections.2.     The Inspector&apos;s ideal criteria for a major airport were-(i)     Viability from the point of view of air traffic control,(ii)     Convenient ground access for passengers and airlineoperators,(iii)     A situation in respect of noise which would notinhibit operations.(iv)     Conformity with regional planning and a national transport plan.(v)     Sufficient land to allow for expansion.3,     The Inspector&apos;s views on the suitability of Stansted andother sites from each of the major aspects on which evidence wasgiven were: -(a)     Air Traffic Control.      Stansted was the best site sofar as routing the flow of additional air traffic was concerned with maximum margins of safety and inconformity with existing routes and airports.      Cliffe,Sheppey and Padworth might not be unworkable, but lossof capacity would have to be accepted at times.Foulness, Dengie Flats and Gunfleet Sands would not bepossible in co-existence with the Shoeburyness firingrange,  and Sheppey would also be,,affected by it to someextent.     Plumstead Marshes was too near London andCastle Donnington too far away to be a &quot;London&quot; airport,Stansted would interfere less with the existing pattern of traffic from Heathrow and Gatwick than Padworth orCliffe.     It would interfere less with Southend airportthan Cliffe, Sheppey, or the Flats in the Foulness area.It might, however, be necessary to review the presentpattern of air traffic control to obtain an idealsolution,   i-:.;
Ground. Access ^ RoadIt was difficult to assess the impact of the potentialairport traffic on existing ground links to the varioussites because no origin and destination survey had sofar been made of the passengers using Heathrow andGatwick.      The assumption throughout the Inquiry wasthat all passengers not using their own means oftransport to the new airport would travel via the:WestEnd of London,     With three London Airports operating,as many as 6,250 people could be delivered to Londonevery hour - many only to go straight out again.     Thispresented a frightening traffic problem.      If theadditional road traffic forecast for the new airportwas superimposed on normal traffic, road access wouldnot be reasonable, or even feasible,  at any of the sites suggested, including Rtansted.      Thus a new and exclusive road traffic route was required.     Theestimates made by the Ministry of Transport of travelling times from London to the several suggestedsites did not carry conviction because (a) they did not allow for varying volumes of traffic at different times and (b) they did not allow for the extra traffic whichwould be generated by the airport itself.     TheMinistry of Transport said that the traffic generatedwould saturate a dual two-lane motorway In twenty yearstime while an expert for the Essex County Council saidthat the traffic would saturate a dual three-lanemotorway.Ground Access - RailApart from road access both Stansted and Padworth couldbe given rail links with London.      The Padworth proposal was the neater of the two.     In &quot;both cases british railways would only be prepared to undertake the work ifit would pay to do so, and it seemed that it would not pay in at least the earlier years of traffic growth.It was not sufficiently demonstrated that there wasenough spare capacity at the existing London terminifor either site for the additional traffic.NoiseThe amount of noise generated by* an aircraft was likelyto stay fairly constant in the foreseeable future andsupersonic aircraft would probably not aggravate theproblem.     Noise would affect more people at Stansted(where a hospital and some twenty schools would have tobe closed) than at any of the alternative sites.Padworth would, however, be little better.      Sheppeywould be the best site from the noise point of view.The approach route to Cliffe would be over water, buttake-off noise would affect the Medway towns andThurrock,  though not intolerably in either case.Agri cultural^, J-ianj.All the land likely to be required at Stansted was inone of the highest agricultural land classificationsfor fertility.      Many thousands of acres of goodfarmland would be lost by siting the airport andassociated housing and industrial development at and near Stansted.2
(f) House ValuesThe value of houses, near an airport in the lower pricebracket, at least, was as high as in a quiet countryarea.     However,  a speedy decision was desirable for those wishing to sell their houses.(g) Regional planning the airport would inevitably attract a considerable increase in population and, if full value was to beobtained from the total project, industries must be accomodated.     Stansted was not the right place for afocus of this kind and the whole rural character of thedistrict would be altered.     A development of this nature at Stansted would be bad regional planning.(h) NationalPlanningA third London Airport of high capacity would increasethe magnetism of the South East for all sorts of activities.     Many long journeys would have to be madeto London, merely to reach the airport, thus increasingits traffic problems.     This should be avoided ifpossible,II.    APPRAISAL OF THE INSPECTOR^ CASE AGAINST STANSTEDl)..     After careful consideration of the Inspector&apos;s arguments theCommittee are agreed -(a) that a third London airport is a national necessity,(b) that there is no reason to regard the development of a third London airport at Stansted as impracticable, and(c) that&apos; though the Inspector&apos;s findings confirm theGovernment&apos;s view that Stansted is not a wholly idealsite for the new airport, his report, nevertheless,contains nothing to suggest that after further study abetter site would be likely to emerge.5.     A detailed discussion follows of the Inspector&apos;s arguments against Stansted,  taken in the same order as they are arranged inthe summary in Section I above,(a)     Air,Traffic Control6,     Although the Inspector accepted that the case for Stanstedon air traffic control grounds was proved, paragraph h8(l) of thereport contains the implication that the Ministry of Aviationwitnesses have considered Stansted (and its alternatives) solelyin relation to an existing route structure.      This view would appearto be influenced by paragraph 13 of the Assessor&apos;s report, whichsuggests that there was a tendency on the part of the Ministry of aviation to treat the existing airways and sequencing areas asvirtually immutable.     This is not a correct statement of theevidence presented by the Ministry of Aviation witnesses.     Thelocal airport approach and departure patterns, includeing holdingareas, depicted on the maps which were presented at the Inquiry,assumed the use of simultaneous parallel landing techniques, whichare still on trial.     The structure shown for Heathrow was not thepresent one, but that which it is planned to introduce when theseprocedures are brought into operation.     The overall terminal area
route structure adumbrated in the same maps was built up aroundthese necessary local patterns, and the precise routes weremostly different from those that now exists     Such similarities as there were arose because our geographical situation in relation to europe and the Americas means that the main traffic streams will want to proceed in the same directions as in the past.     The broaddirection of a route which was already optimum was not changed.(b)    and    (c)    ground access - road and railGeneral7,     In the Ministry of Transport1s view, the Inspector was rightto be concerned about the problem of surface access to the third london Airport.      The problem is-  of course,  just one aspect of thegeneral problem of how to cope in the future with the growth oftravel desires in the London area.     It would be idle to pretend that easy solutions are in sight.      Certainly, heavy investment in roads will continue to be needed, public transport facilitieswill have to be improved and extended and in some areas restraint of road traffic by one method or another may very probably benecessary.     As for the specific problem of access to airports,one possibility that must be seriously considered is to providefor mass transit between the airport and London by coach,  surfacerail or underground (or a combination of them), or, conceivably,by some less conventional form of transport.8.     Thus the Ministry of Transport acknowledge the problemsassociated with surface access to the third airport - any thirdairport.     But they emphasise strongly that, of all the sites which appear to be possibilities,    Stansted is the one at which thedifficulties would almost certainly be at their least.9.     The Ministry of Transport also have a number of detailedcomments on particular paragraphs of the Inspector&apos;s report.Amount.of road traffic generated by a third London airport -Paragraph 1k   &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;10,   The road traffic generated by the airport will certainlypose problems.     This would, of course, be so at any site.     Butthe total number of vehicles entering and leaving the airport isonly relevant to the consideration of the layout and capacityof the road providing the immediate access hp the airport.Moreover, the traffic estimate quoted in this paragraph is basedon the assumption that the proportions of people entering orleaving the airport by private and by public transport would bethe same as at Heathrow currently,,     Whether this will in fact be so depends among other things on the policies to be adopted bythe British Airports Authority in relation to passenger processing,car parking space and so on.     It is possible however that, if an attractive mass transit link to the third airport were provided, asubstantial proportion of travellers would use it.     Any measuresof restraint of road traffic which were introduced in London might also tend to increase the proportion of people using a mass transitfacility.k
Access to Stansted compared with, access to Heathrow -&quot;^S^^^mni^EiE^r&quot;&quot;&quot;11,   Throughout the Inquiry there was an understandable tendency to compare the possible sites for a third London airport withHeathrow.      In terms of proximity and accessibility to central london, Heathrow is unique, and,  short of the clearance of thousands of acres of suburbia to make way for a new airport,must remain so.      It is against this background that the questionof road access to a third London airport must be considered.Airlines operating at any of the possible third airport siteswould be worse off than at Heathrow.     This is inevitable.     Butsurface access to Stansted appears in fact to be better than toany other possible site.Estimates of journey times by road to Stansted - Paragraph 5612.   The estimates of journey time cannot of course be firm,relating as they do to a time some years ahead when we cannotpredict precisely what road improvements will have been made,what traffic policies will be in force or even exactly whatvolumes of traffic there will be.     The estimates were simplythe best that could be made at the time.     The Inspector&apos;scriticism that the time taken for the in-town sector could &quot;varyenormously according to the state of the traffic&quot; must againapply equally to traffic by road to central London from any&quot;third airport&quot; site.     The volume of traffic generated by the airport itself would be relatively less significant the further the distance from the airport, and would not be likely to affectgreatly the journey time to Central London.Effect of airport traffic on road congestion - Paragraphs 37 and 3813.   Use of the word &quot;saturated&quot; is misleading.     The lower and higher estimates of peak hour traffic referred to by the Inspectorwould correspond roughly to the design capacity of dual two-laneand dual three-lane motorways respectively which is the capacityat which no vehicle travelling on the road impeded any other.&quot;Saturation&quot; implies the inability to carry additional traffic;this condition would not set in until flows substantiallyexceeded design capacity01k.   As the Ministry siiggests earlier,  the total number of arrivalsend departures is only relevant to the consideration of the roadlayout on the airport itself.      It is true that in the case ofStansted a high proportion of this traffic might be expected touse the length of M11 immediately to the south of BishopTs Stortford.But the traffic would &quot;fan out&quot; as it approached London.     Anyairport terminal in London would be essentially a collecting point for passengers using coaches or other mass transit facilities whichmight be provided and not for passengers by car.     The chancesare that if the mass transit facility were good enough it wouldbe used by the great majority whose origin and destination are reasonably near the terminal.Feasibility of rail link between Stansted and Victoria -Paragraphs 39-A1&quot;15*   British Rail have recently confirmed that in their view arail service could be provided between Stansted and Victoria witha journey time of an hour, and that Victoria could accommodate the extra traffic.      It is not clear on what evidence the5
Inspector challenged, this.      Whether such a link would pay overtime would depend on many things - not least on the level offares.     The present coach service to Heathrow demonstratesthat people are prepared to pay well above standard prices fora specialised service.Volume . of traffic passing - through^a ^cenjtral^^town terminal^at16.   The comments made here by the Inspector would again applyto any airport link with a town centre terminal.      But airporttraffic will form only a very small proportion of the totaltraffic in Inner London.      In any case there is no certainty that existing air terminal policy will operate in the future.It is possible, for example,  that passengers for Central Londonusing public transport might be delivered to several terminals,sited to suit various needs.Collection and dietribution of passer.;:ors at the new airport -Paragraph hi17.   The opinion expressed by the Inspector that steps shouldbe taken to prevent passengers travelling to Central London ifthey do not need to does not appear relevant to the choice ofStansted or of any other, particular location as the third airport.(d)    NoiseGeneral18.    In his report the Inspector appears to dismiss the case forStansted on noise grounds.      However, the reasoning that led himto this conclusion is faulty.      In the first place it is clearthat wherever a third London airport is sited it is bound to cause some noise nuisance,      The crucial question is whetherStansted is likely to produce more noise nuisance than thepracticable alternatives,  and,  if so, how much more.      From theevidence before him the Inspector was well able to form a view on how much noise nuisance from a third London airport,wherever placed,, would be inescapable.     As he did not formsuch a view there is, therefore, no means of assessing from his report the strength of the arguments &quot;against Stansted on noisegrounds.     Secondly, it seems from the report that the Inspectordid not really consider the Ministry of Aviation1s evidence as awhole, with the result that his presentation of it is distortedand open to misinterpretation.      For these two principal reasons the Inspector&apos;s rejection of Stansted on noise grounds isunjustified.     These critcisms of the Inspectorfs case areillustrated in detail in the following paragraphs.Restrict ions on ..ni\ght ojee^ U-8 (3),.and ^5.).19.    One of the Inspector!s criteria for a major airport is&quot;a situation as regards noise which does not inhibit operations&quot;(paragraph 14.8(3));    and it is implied in paragraph 1+8(5) thatthe principal restriction he has in mind is one on night flying.Further, the Inspector recognises at the end of this paragraphthat &quot;the ideal is no doubt unattainable&quot;.     Elsewhere -paragraph 23(2)(c)  - the Inspector expresses the opinion thatat Stansted &quot;restrictions would have to be imposed which would materially restrict capacity operation&quot;.      (He presumably meansrestrictions on night flying;    and if so, this is an opinion6
with which one cannot quarrel - at any rate until quieteraircraft come into service.)      However, he also says inparagraph 29 that &quot;severe nuisance from noise is unavoidable atany location which could be considered a London Airport&quot;.What the Inspector completely fails to assess is whether noisewould or would not &quot;materially restrict capacity operation&quot; atsites other than Stansted;    and this omission makes it virtually impossible for him to reach an objective opinion of Stansted&apos;srelative merits on noise grounds,Criter inn^f^r^me^asii^ing ^noise ^nui^ance -- J?aragrapja JL520,   The Inspector did not find the Noise and Number Index very helpful in assessing noise nuisance.      In paragraph 13 heprefers to give &quot;some indication of the nuisance to which houses,shops and other buildings would be subject&quot; by quoting from theevidence of Mr. Sawyer (Head of A.0,R.B., Ministry of Aviation)on the probable situation in nearby schools and hospitals asthey are at present constructed.      However, the evidence of witnesses for two of the main objectors (Professor Richards andMr, Fleming)., as well as the evidence of the Ministry witness,was that the position in schools,  and to a lesser extent in hospitals, was rather special in that it depended on the degreeof interference with speech in class-rooms rather than on moregeneralised feelings of annoyance.      It is therefore illogicalfor the Inspector to argue as he does in paragraph 13 of thereport, that the effects of siting a major airport at Stanstedon schools and hospitals in the vicinity is evidence of its effects on houses, shops and other buildings.21.   Despite his difficulties with the Noise and Number Index,which are understandable, the Inspector records in Appendix 2to the report (paragraph 78) that all four noise witnessesadopted this technique of the Wilson Committee.     He also makesincidental use himself of a criterion of l\3 N.N.I. in that the,000 houses given in paragraph 13 of the main report as being&quot;subject to grave nuisance by noise at Stansted&quot; are the numberwithin the k5 N.N.I. contour.Noise disturbance to homes around Stansted - paragraph 1322.   Even the statement just mentioned about the number ofhouses that would be &quot;subject to grave nuisance by noise at stansted&quot; results from a misinterpretation of the Ministry of aviation&apos;s evidence.      In Appendix 2, paragraph 85, the inspector quotes the Ministry of Aviation witness as saying thatk5 N.N.I. should be the &quot;datum&quot; in both rural and urban areas,This is correct to the extent that the witness suggested that an area bounded by a line one mile outside the us N.N.I. contour wasone where the extent of interference with speech could beprofitably examined.      But the Inspector is incorrect if he isattributing to the witness any statement that NNIs greater thank5 represent an exposure to noise that is intolerable from thepoint of view of the annoyance caused;    at no time did thewitness depart from the Wilson Committee&apos;s criterion of 50-60NNI for this.Noise disturbance to jsjchqqls^ around ^Stansted - JParagraph-1323.   Despite the Inspector&apos;s play with the numbers of schoolsthat would, be affected by noise in paragraph 13? there was infact a conflict of evidence on the levels of noise that would cause trouble in schools - a conflict which the Inspector himselfrecognised (see paragraph 85-86 of Appendix 2).      Furthermore,in paragraph 13 of his report the Inspector quotes the
Ministry of Aviation witness as saying that, of the schoolswithin the area of the 1+5 N.N.I. contour (and up to a mile beyond),one half would have to be closed on noise grounds and otherschools would have to be examined individually to see if remedial measures were possible.     The Inspector has misinterpreted theevidence here - the Ministry of Aviation&apos;s submission was thatthe majority of schools under consideration v/ould have to closennless they were adequately soundproofed, but that the remainderwould have to &quot;be examined individually to see if remedial measures were necessary.     These points were brought out quite clearly duringcross-examination of the Ministry1s witness, as well as in theirCounsel&apos;s closing speech.     At no time did the Ministry state thatthe majority of the schools in question would inevitably have to close.Noise,disturbance to Herts, and Essex Hospital atBishop&quot;7^ Stortford - Paragraph. 1J52k.   In the same paragraph the Inspector records the view of theMinistry of Aviation witness that the Herts, and Essex Hospitalat Bishop&apos;s Stortford would have to close down if a third london airport were built at Stansted.     What the report does not recordis the evidence of the Senior Consultant Pathologist at theHospital, which was referred to in Counsel&apos;s closing speech, thatthere were long-term plans for rebuilding the entire Hospital(which at the moment consists largely of temporary buildings).This testimony is, in fact, confirmed by the Ministry of Health&apos;latest circular on the hospital building programme (Cmnd. 3000).Comparison of Stansted and Padworth - Paragraph 1525.   In paragraph 31 of the report the Inspector records therelative numbers of people affected at Stansted and Padworthincorrectly.      Evidence was given on numbers of houses and of people within the 50 and 1+5 N.N.I. contours, as drawn by theMinistry of Aviation, at both sites, and on the 35 and 25 NNIcontours drawn by the witness for the North West Essex and EastHerts.     Preservation Association (Professor Richards).     Thefigures were 50 N.N.I. - Padworth 4,01+8&apos;;   Stansted 2,950;   us N.N.I. -Padworth 7,1+1 1+;     Stansted 6,960;    35 N.N.I. - Padworth 32,000;Stansted 38,000;    25 N.N.I. - Padworth 69,000;    Stansted 1+8,000.Thus, only withir. the 35 N.N.I. contour was the number of peoplegreater for Stansted than for Padworth. ;   These figures were infact accepted by the opposition to the proposal.(e)     Agricultural Land26.   It must be accepted that there will be a considerable lossof good agricultural land if the airport and its associateddevelopment is situated at Stansted,     However, this will be thecase, to some degree, wherever the development takes place.     Thequestion is therefore, whether any reasonable alternative site is available which v/ould minimise the loss of good agricultural land.     All the alternative sites have however been examined insome detail in this report and it is evident that each of themsuffers from defects such as to outweigh whatever purelyagricultural advantages it may possess.     No one would suggest thatthe loss to agriculture, caused by siting the airport at Stansted,would call into question in itself the requirement for a third london airport.8
(f)    Hous^e VaAuejg27.   The Inspector accepted the evidence that the value of&quot;houses near an airport, in the lower price bracket, in short supply&quot;5 was at least as high as in a quiet country area(paragraph 19).    He goes on to say, in paragraph 20, that peoplewishing to sell hmises near Stansted Airport are experiencinghardship because of uncertainty about the future developmentof the airport, and adds that a speedy decision is important to such people.    It is noteworthy, however, that his finalrecommendation for another study on the siting of the third london airport (paragraph 47) would, if implemented, preventthe reaching of a speedy decision on Stansted.(The Inspector seems to use the term &quot;regional planning&quot;to describe what is usually called town and country planning.    It is convenient to include with town and country planning under this heading considerations oflocal amenity, apart from noise.)28.   Here again the Inspector&apos;s conclusions are arbitrary,  andhe fails to make a balanced judgment of how far objections on grounds of planning and local amenity apply with greater force to Stansted than to the practicable alternative sites,Town and ,Country Planning29.   The Inspector considered that it would be bad planning tosite a major airport at Stansted since the wedge of open countrybetween the trunk roads to Cambridge and Colchester shouldbe preserved as a natural and valuable lung for London.He accepted that Stansted did not lie along a line of natural growth from London and that the straggle of development up theLea &quot;Valley was contrary to principles of correct spacing for large and medium sized towns,30.   There can be no doubt that it would be desirable tomaintain this open stretch of attractive countryside, but its value must be assessed in relation to the needs with which weare faced.   A third international airport must, as we haveshown5 be reasonably close to London.    At the same time it mustbe sited where it will cause as little nuisance as possibleto built-up areas.    All open sites around London are potentiallyvaluable and worth preserving as green lungs.    It has notbeen shown, however,  that the Stansted area is so much more valuable by its nature than any other area within range ofLondon that it must be excluded from consideration for that reason alone.    In other words, there is no doubt about thedesirability of maintaining this stretch of country, but the .argument cannot be decisive since it applies in varying degree to all the potential sites.31.   Furthermore, there is doubt whether the existingcharacter of the Stansted area can in any case be maintained in perpetuity.    There Is increasing pressure of populationmoving from London and the Outer Metropolitan region.   Whilstthis can be contained and channelled to some extent, it isalready having an effect on the Stansted area.9
As stated in the evidence at the Inquiry,  the population ofBishops Stortford Urban District itself is expected to increase by about 50 per cent (20,000 to 30,000) up to&quot;&apos; 1973, most of whomwill probably be commuters.   Pressures are also developing inother market towns and villages in the area, and a broad band ofdevelopment arising from the planned movement of Londonpopulation is taking place in an arc to the north and oast.The picture is not,  therefore,  one of an entirely static,unspoilt area which can and must be maintained as such.    Whileit is accepted that because.se of its position and character,  thearea is not one that would otherwise have been selected as a major growth point,  forces of change are already at work and inthe circumstances limited major development,  over and above thedevelopment already taking place, is tolerable on planninggrounds.32.   What such major development is likely to amount to isdifficult to foretell.    The ultimate population requirements ofa new airport and associated enterprises cannot be determined atthis stage, but it seems likely that most of the populationincrease could suitably be contained in a single new town.Much of the countryside could consequently retain its characterunimpaired.    The presence of the airport would,  of course,affect nearby settlements,  but changes in these settlements arealready taking place and would merely be hastened.    The existingpattern of settlements will be changed, but there are adequatepowers to control the relationship between new and old so as toprovide a sensible pattern taking a.account both of economic needs and preservation of the amenities.33.   The Inspector has laid considerable weight on the localopposition to the proposal since he agrees that such an intrusionwould change the whole character of the area.    This argument,which would apply to any site selected,  is reinforced in thecase of Stansted by the fact that the area is predominantly ruraland contains towns and villages of beauty and historicassociations.    The essential point here Is the plea for the&apos;retention of the status, quo.    However, as pointed out above,the pressure of development in South East England is such thatthe static nature of settlements can no longer be maintained in perpetuity.    Changes will take place whether an airport is introduced or not, 8.1 though the pace&apos;will be hastened if&apos; that does occur.    An active policy of development control can,however, limit the effects of such changes, by preserving whatis best and steering new development to areas where it will doleast harm to existing amenities.    On the other side of the picture, additional activity In the area will stimulate theprovision of services,  eg, roads, schools, hospitals and cultural facilities, which will be of benefit to the peoplealreadv living there as well as to the new arrivals.(h)    Natijjnapl Planning34.   The Inspector&apos;s suggestion that a new London Airport mightbe unnecessary and undesirable in its effect on national planning has been discussed in detail in the main body of our report (Section IV).EA10A3-6610
