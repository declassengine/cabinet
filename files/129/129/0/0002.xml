SECRET GUARD j[  (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(67) 5214th April, 1967EUROPE; ALTERNATIVES TO MEMBERSHIP.QF ,THEEUROPEAN ECONOMIC community note by the Secretary of the cabinet at their Meeting on Thursday, 3rd November, 1966(CC(66) 54th Conclusions), the Cabinet instructed that studies shouldbe prepared of the implications for the United Kingdom&apos;s economic position and prospects of two policies which would need to beconsidered as alternatives to membership of the European economic community (e.c.), i. e. membership of an Atlantic Free Trade Area(AFTA), and abstention from any new association with a wider groupingof countries (Abstention).     These studies have now been completed byan interdepartmental committee, the report of which is attached.2.      In accordance with its terms of reference, the Committee didnot take account of the wider political considerations essential to a balanced assessment of either alternative.     The purpose of this note,which has been prepared in discussion with a Group of permanent secretaries, is to draw attention to the more important of these considerations and to comment on certain major issues in the Report.Some of these considerations would apply to either alternative but, inconformity with the Committee &apos;s report, the two alternatives are sofar as possible treated separately.3.      As is made clear in its Report (which is summarised in respectof abstention in paragraphs 46-48 and in respect of AFTA inparagraphs 64, (shorter-term effects), 73-74 (longer--term) and 78(implications for economic and financial management) there weredivergent views in the Committee; these particularly concerned the merits of an AFTA, where the Committee recognised that the uncertainties were so great that no single confident judgment waspossible.    Within this general framework the range of views about the likely outcome of an AFTA was wide.4.      This note, like the Committee^ Report, does not seek to makeany systematic comparison between AFTA and Abstention, or betweeneither of them and membership of the e.c.,    It would be difficult toattempt any quantitative assessment of the economic implications ofany of these three courses and such an attempt must, in proportion asit looks ahead for more than a year or two, become increasinglyprecarious and speculative.     The scope and scale of the factors whichhave to be assessed is such, and their uncertainty so great, that overthe periods on which such long-term alternatives must be judged, theorder of magnitude of the errors involved in any quantitative assess-ment is so great as to make it dangerous to rely on ouch estimates.-1-COPY NO.   66CABINET
SECRET   GUARDBasic factors5.      The Committee&apos;s Report notes that in addition to the pursuit of sound domestic policies which, in any situation, is of overriding importance, a basic factor in determining the future prosperity of theUnited Kingdom is the climate of world trade; and that this climate willin turn be much affected by, and in some circumstances depend on, thegeneral international climate and the extent to which relatively stableeconomic and political conditions prevail,6.     The pattern of development in recent years of the economies ofthe main industrial countries and of the trade between them has beensuch that the future prospects of all of them depend largely on their governments pursuing reasonably liberal trade policies and ensuring thatthe mechanism for international payments does not inhibit economic growth and the expansion of trade essential to it.    The United Kingdom,because of its heavy dependence on trade and its long-establishedoutward-looing stance, particularly needs the continuance of anexpansionist climate of world trade and payments.Atlantic Free Trade Area7.     As is made clear in paragraphs 20-22 of the Cornmittee&apos;s Report,there is no possibility of an AFTA coming into being with the world economic order as it is now.    This means that an AFTA is not negotiablein present circumstances.    Decisions about future economic strategy for the United Kingdom must be taken in the context of what is possiblenow: and at present AFTA is not an &quot;option&quot; open to the United Kingdom.8.      It is conceivable that an AFTA might become a possibility in theevent of a breakdown in economic relations between the United Statesand the e.c..    This might, for example, take the form of a total failureof the Kennedy Round as a result of the Community&apos;s policies andattitudes, and of continuing lack of progress in current discussions on international liquidity as a result of the behaviour of the Europeancreditor countries.    In such circumstances the United States might be driven to adopt new policies in the international economic and monetaryfields, if necessary in direct opposition to the interests and policies of continental Europe.    Such a situation would inevitably involve a parallelchange in United States defence policy, and would be extremely dangerous to this country in every respect.    We should find ourselves existing inthe circumstances of a deep cleavage between our present major allies,and we could not expect membership of an AFTA, in which we should bevery much a junior partner to the United States, to compensate for the risks to our interests and perhaps to our security, which in an increasingly unstable world we should find it difficult to countervail.Abstention9.     The Committee&apos;s Report concentrates on an examination ofAbstention in the long term.    There is, of course, a great differenceboth in economic and political terms between deciding as a matter of long-term strategy not to seek membership of the e.c. and a short-term decision not to seek membership within the next few years.-2-
SECRET- GUARD10.     The Report makes clear that the United Kingdom could continueto earn a reasonably good living if we continued in the present situation,though it also makes clear that such a situation cannot be regarded asa &quot;soft option&quot; in economic terms.    We should have to be ready toaccept the social disruptions inherent in the radical reorganisation ofour pattern of production necessary to enable us to prosper.    It wouldnot be easier to do this on our own than it would be inside an enlargedEEC:  in form we might be more free, but it would be a freedom tosubmit to disagreeable necessities.11.     We feel that the Committee&apos;s Report does not assign sufficient importance to the risks and difficulties for the United Kingdom in thelong run arising from the formation and consolidation of other tradingblocs.    This trend is already seen in the e.c., the Latin american and Australian/New Zealand free trade areas, the Eastern bloceconomic system, and perhaps in the movement towards free tradein limited sectors between the United States and Canada (of whichmotorcars are the only example hitherto).     Even if tariff levels on average are reduced, the consolidation of other trading blocs entailsthe creation of a measure of discrimination against United Kingdomproducts.    Moreover, such trends in the development of world tradeand industry will intensify the pressure on the United Kingdom tospecialise in an increasing degree in a more limited range ofindustrial products, and to do this v/ithout the benefit of a largeassured domestic market comparable in size with those of our majorcompetitors.    We should not be able to compete effectively unless wewere willing to adjust our economy rapidly, and the pressure on us todo so would increase.    These pressures would have consequences -social, industrial and political - which need no emphasis.     There isno reason to assume that the pressures on us to change, and the socialdisadvantages of such pressures, would be any greater if we wereoutside the e.c. than if we were inside it, but it would certainly bemore difficult for us to react purposively to them if we were on ourown than in the more dynamic economic conditions which we would expect if we were within the e.c..12.     A conscious and definite long-term policy not to seek accession to the e.c. could have significant political overtones.    Inevitably itwould adversely affect our political relations with the six countries ofthe e.c..    It is probable that over the years such influence as we now have with the United States would diminish.     Our ability to preventunfavourable political developments (especially a split betweenWestern Europe and North America), and our ability to promotedesirable developments (such as improved relations between theSoviet Union and the Western world) would be further reduced.    Weshould be better able to influence these developments in the interestsof our own security if we were partners of a larger grouping than ifwe were alone.-3-
SECRET    m GUARD1413.    A conscious and long-term policy of Abstention is, however,an unlikely development (though it is possible that the members of the eec might interpret a short-term decision not immediately to seekmembership as indicating such a long-term policy).    For ourselves,it seems more probable that if we were again rebuffed by the e.c. or if we decided not to apply to join, we should continue to pursue ourpresent trading policies, including the retention - as far as possiblein the face of their steady erosion - of the privileges which we enjoyin Commonwealth markets; in short that we should not make any overtand declared change of policy but should continue much as we are inthe hope (in which we should be encouraged by the United States)that at a later stage a more favourable opportunity might occur.(Signed) BURKE trend cabinet Office, S.

POSSIBLE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ARRANGEMENTSREPORT BY OFFICIALSWe were constituted on 18th November, 1966, with the following termsof reference:&quot; To study the implications for the economic policies and prospects ofthe United Kingdom (UK) of:(i) UK membership of a North Atlantic Free Trade Area;(l)(ii) abstention from accession to any new international trade or economic grouping.&quot;We met under the chairmanship of the Department of Economic Affairs.Representatives of the Treasury, the Foreign and Commonwealth Offices, theBoard of Trade, the Ministries of Agriculture and Technology and the Bank ofEngland, and also the Economic Adviser, Cabinet Office, took part in the work.2.   Our report consists of the following sections:A. Economic background.    In this we  consider briefly the generaldeterminants of British prosperity whichever course the UK were tofollow; and the environment from which this country could set outon either of the courses we were asked to study.B. Implications of &quot; Abstention &quot;.C. Implications of an AFTA.D. Concluding remarks.   Here we touch on some general considerations which would be relevant to any assessment of UK prospects in theevent of &quot; Abstention&quot; or an AFTA (including the feasibility of negotiating an AFTA) and outline our conclusions.3. We had in mind in our study the primary importance of understanding the long-term effects of each set of policies, though we also recognised that therewould be complex problems arising out of a period of transition if the UKentered a new grouping. Either way the question naturally arises of how theposition of the UK would compare with the prospect revealed by the normaleconomic forecasts.4. A study is in progress as part of the general medium-term planningexercise on the UK&apos;s economic prospects up to 1972; it will be available towardsthe end of May and some aspects of it before that date. That study is intendedto provide a framework within which various alternative policies can be examined. The basic framework will be drawn up in the first instance on theassumption that there is no major change in the economic associations of the UK,but even if it were available now its time-scale would not be long enough to throw much light on the relative advantages of the effects of specific proposals inthe international field over an extended period. In many cases moreover theeffect of the proposals which we are now considering is bound to be so mucha matter of judgment that statistical projections would be of little help.A.  ECONOMIC BACKGROUNDDeterminants of British economic prosperity5. The future prosperity of the UK will be determined basically by two factors: the nature and effectiveness of our domestic policies and the climate of world trade. This climate will in turn be much affected by, and in some circumstances be dependent on, the general international climate and the extentto which relatively stable conditions prevail.  Unless these factors are favourableC) We refer throughout to an Atlantic Free Trade Area (AFTA) to avoid confusion with theexisting New Zealand Australia Free Trade Area (NAFTA).
the Government will fail in their objective of combining full employment andeconomic growth at home with a satisfactory balance of payments with overseas countries. The UK finds difficulty, as do other countries, in pursuing the objectives simultaneously, and the key to success in present circumstances is tosecure increased economic and industrial efficiency (along with an effective prices and incomes policy) which would make possible a faster growth of productivitytogether with an improvement in the UK&apos;s international competitive position.6. The UK must devise and operate effective domestic economic policies,and be prepared to bring about substantial changes in the structure of industryand in the allocation of resources. In the longer run it is reasonable to assume that UK growth prospects will depend to a major extent on the growth of productive potential. This will be determined by the growth of the labour force(which is currently expected to show no increase up to 1975 and to grow veryslowly thereafter), and by the rate of increase in its productivity. The latter will depend largely on success in increasing the UK&apos;s economic efficiency throughinternal measures.7. There are, however, two qualifications. First, the constraint on growththat may be associated with action to deal with the UK balance of paymentscannot be ignored. In so far as balance of payments difficulties lead to repeatedchecks on the expansion of demand there will be an adverse effect on confidence,investment, productivity and unit costs of output. So the measures put intooperation, or the mechanisms adopted, to adjust the balance of payments, should as far as possible avoid restrictions on production. It is also true that the UKwill be better able to avoid balance of payments difficulties if the world as awhole provides a steadily expanding market for UK exports.8. Secondly, provided UK industry is competitive in international markets,the growth of UK efficiency will be greater in a world in which there areopportunities for increasing international specialisation and economies of scale;and in which there is the challenge of foreign competition. UK policies must therefore be directed towards the maintenance of harmonious relations with other major trading nations based upon continued liberal commercial regimes. the uk should avoid action which would provoke or encourage others to be lessliberal.9. In broad outline, we conclude that the growth and prosperity of the uk will depend on:(i) the effectiveness of the Government^ policies, external and internal;(ii) expanding markets for UK exports;(iii) low barriers against UK exports;(iv) low barriers against imports into the UK;(v) a smoothly working international monetary system.Paragraphs 10-16 set out our view of how far these factors can be expected tobe favourable over the next decade; they are also relevant to the specific discussions of the &quot; Abstention&quot; and AFTA situations in later sections of this report.Paragraphs 17-22 define more closely the situations in which the UK would belikely to &quot; Abstain &quot; and to become a member of an AFTA.External environment(i) Production and trade10. During the past 10 years the real gross national product in organisation for Economic Co-operation Development (OECD) countries (including the UnitedStates (US), Canada and Japan) has grown at about 4 per cent a year, trade byvalue at 7 per cent, and investment has reached levels around 20 per cent of the gross national product (GNP). There are many forces at work to make for a continuation of expansion of world trade and production, and generally liberalcommercial policies within the advanced industrial countries:(a) The Governments of most advanced industrial countries accept as objects of policy responsibility for maintaining full employment and economic growth.
(b) A high proportion of total resources devoted to investment, together withthe devotion of considerable resources to the application of science and technology, and the organisation of large international industrialcomplexes, may all be expected to contribute to faster growth.(c) The main industrial countries now have industrial structures of comparablematurity, and consequently the pressure for increasing protectivebarriers has diminished.(d) The prosperity of recent years has come about, in a period of increasinglyliberal policies, non-discrimination, and most-favoured-nation (mfn)treatment, and has thus commended such policies.(e) The main industrial countries are committed to substantial aid programmes to sustain and build up the economies of the less developed countries(ldc&apos;s). These programmes, though checked in various ways at thepresent time, will remain very significant.(f) Capital flows on private account, though discouraged by disturbedconditions in some ldc&apos;s, and checked by government action in the us and UK, can still be expected to contribute to the growth of trade.(g) The Eastern bloc is gradually becoming more open and providing moreopportunities for trade, although for many years to come it is likelyto play a relatively small part in world trade.11. We cannot entirely ignore the possibility that the US and the european economic Community (e.c.) will become more protectionist and that the tendency of the Communist States towards more multilateral trading will be reversed. Itis possible that the e.c. will strengthen and extend its preferential tradingarrangements in Africa, and the US negotiate similar arrangements in Latin America.If tariffs are further reduced non-tariff barriers may be devised to reintroduceprotection. Divergencies in wage rates, if not otherwise corrected, may result in balance of payments difficulties that will justify the use of import restrictions.These and other adverse developments are all possible but in our view unlikelyon a significant scale within the next 10 years unless there is a major recessionin the main industrial countries simultaneously.12. Much responsibility will rest with the US authorities both for fosteringtheir own growth and for maintaining a climate for liberal progress; but the EECsattitude will be hardly less important to the UK. UK trade will still be big enoughto afford appreciable bargaining power, but this country will be less able than inthe past to move others far in a positive direction. Nevertheless the choice of the wrong policies by the UK could still influence the policy of others in directionswhich would diminish the opportunities for international trade.(ii) International monetary system13. We think it reasonable to expect that a single world monetary systembased on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and on the gold exchange standardwill continue and that means will be found to provide sufficient growth in worldreserves to avoid any break-down in world trade. This implies some change inthe existing system, and this may come about through the establishment of a new form of international asset on the lines now being discussed. Alternatively it could come through some development of the existing IMF system, or through someaccommodation between Europe and the US under which the former would not object seriously to the continuation of US deficits on a small scale, and therefore to some continuing growth of dollar reserves. This expectation may be a littleoptimistic but it is by no means unrealistic: there are powerful forces which arelikely to prevent the world moving towards any serious disruption of the presentsystem. It may also be expected that the price of gold will remain as at presentand that there will be no substantial alteration of exchange rates as between north america and Europe. The precise means by which a relatively stable situation might be preserved is of secondary importance and it would not be profitable inthis report to discuss the various possibilities in detail.14. In such a relatively stable world it must be assumed that sterling would continue to function as a major international trading currency. The UK maywell be successful in securing an arrangement which would afford at least somesafeguard against fluctuations in the balances, both official and private. But subjectto this, the assumption is that it would not be possible,&apos; even if it were desirable,
to relieve sterling altogether of its role as a reserve currency. In these circumstances the degree of strain which the international role of sterling, as distinct from the uk&apos;s balance of payments problem, imposed upon the UK would not be greatlydifferent from that experienced in recent years. The surest method of dealingwith the problems of sterling, and thus relieving whatever constraints they mayimpose, would be a substantial and long-term improvement in the UK balance ofpayments.15. An alternative possibility would be that continuation of US deficitsand of an outflow of gold from the US could within a period of years bring the USauthorities to a point where they felt compelled either to raise the price of gold or to sever the link with gold altogether. Such a drastic move is only likely tobe brought about by severe pressure on the US gold stock. It might be morepalatable to US public opinion at a time of disillusionment with continentalEuropean policy towards the entry of the UK into the e.c., the Kennedy Round,and the creation of international liquidity. And although such disillusionmentmight also provide the conditions in which the US authorities might becomeinterested in trading arrangements of the AFTA type, it does not necessarily follow that they would see advantage in simultaneously making a monetarybreak and in setting up an AFTA.16. Thus it is possible that, whether inside an AFTA or abstaining fromany new grouping, the UK might find itself in a world in which one set of major industrial countries based their currencies on gold while another set, includingthe UK, pegged on the dollar. In these circumstances the UK might find that itscompetitive position, along with that of the US, was improved vis-a-vis the goldbloc although trade generally would be bound to suffer from a split in the world&apos;smonetary system. Moreover the gold in UK reserves would then be of relativelylimited usefulness. But since a new international monetary situation of thiskind could only be brought about by a virtually unilateral decision by the US wehave not examined its implications in any detail. However, we think it likely that, because of the damage that would be caused by a split between the dollar-sterling bloc on the one hand and a European gold bloc on the other, the six and the US would quickly be led to seek means of managing the relationsbetween the two blocs in a reasonably stable manner.Context of Abstention and AFTA17. It is essential to envisage the setting in which the Government mightbe called upon to evolve an alternative to UK membership of the e.c..18. This contingency could arise as a result of the UK&apos;s failure to enter the Community either because the British Government decided that the price would be too high or as a result of attempts by existing members of theCommunity to raise the price of UK entry-during the negotiations. such circumstances would be the occasion of regret in international economic relations,but not necessarily of recrimination. Given that the UK&apos;s failure to enter theCommunity led to no sharp deterioration in the international economic climate,and that the Community avoided a direct confrontation with the US by permittingsome progress in the Kennedy Round and not obstructing completely any progressin discussions on international liquidity, there would be no reason to expect thatthe US would undertake a radical reappraisal of their relations with Europe.19. In such a situation the UK would be outside the e.c. and wouldprobably have no opportunity of joining an AFTA, since the US would not havealtered their existing stance. Section B of our report assesses the outlook forthe UK economy in this event.20. Alternatively UK failure to enter the Community might be a result ofa positive veto by General de Gaulle. Such a veto could well be combined withthe effective prevention of any results from the Kennedy Round; and might befollowed over a period by obstruction of any progress on international liquidity.These developments would undoubtedly cause tensions within the Communitybut, on the basis of past experience, would be unlikely to lead to its collapse. TheUS Government would then certainly make a review of their European policies.They would no doubt reflect that in the first place progress with the political andeconomic integration of Western Europe as a whole would have come to a halt with
UK exclusion from the e.c.. In the second place the failure of the kennedy round would have meant the failure of the US attempt to minimise the importanceof the Community by general tariff reductions. And in the third place forcesmaking for the reduction of US influence in IMF and for the continued weakening of the dollar as a reserve currency would have been strengthened.21. In those circumstances US disillusionment might be very great. The USGovernment might well take the view that the price in terms of limitations oftheir freedom in foreign and defence policies of maintaining the single worldmonetary system was no longer worth paying. If they took this decision theprobable outcome would be the division of the world into two monetary blocs,one in which the sterling area would be included based on the dollar, the otheran e.c. bloc maintaining a link with gold. The US Government, if this were to happen, might also decide to try to strengthen US economic and trading links with those countries which had supported their policies and whose monetarysystems were now linked with that of the US, i.e., the UK, certain old commonwealth countries and the Scandinavian members of the European free trade Association (EFTA).22. In short, it seems to us that the possibility of an AFTA being openedto the UK and other countries depends on the breakdown of US policies in theEuropean and world trade fields and probably also on the division of the worldinto two monetary blocs. But in any case, we consider that an AFTA, with which section C of our report is concerned, could only come into being as a result of major changes in US policy, and perhaps only following US initiatives.B.  ABSTENTION FROM ACCESSION TO ANY NEW regional economic GROUPING23. Our terms of reference speak of &quot; abstention from accession to any new international trade or economic grouping &quot;. We have taken this expression to mean a situation in which (a) the UK is not a member of the e.c. nor ofany other regional group such as an AFTA; and (b) the prospects of the UKbecoming a member of any such group are remote enough not to affect theGovernments freedom to choose the policies to be pursued. Whether or not adecision to keep open the option of joining either the e.c. or an AFTA at alater stage would act as a constraint on the policies which the UK might pursueis a question which we have not examined in detail, but there is a presumption that it would impose some limitations on what the UK might do in both the external and domestic fields.24. In this section we consider first of all what would be the generalexternal economic environment in which the UK would have to operate and,secondly, what sort of policies the Government might pursue in order to make themost of our position.25. For the reasons given earlier we think it likely that world economicconditions will develop in future as favourably as in the recent past. It wouldbe consistent with this view to envisage that UK external relationships willremain broadly unchanged, i.e., that the UK will be able to maintain free tradewith at least the more important EFTA countries, that preferential arrangements with the Commonwealth will remain but will continue to be eroded, and alsothat the framework of international economic and political institutions-theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the IMF, OECD and theUnited Nations will remain broadly unchanged.26. Given the general external economic background, it is clear that themain remaining factor affecting the UK&apos;s economic performance and prospectswill be the Governments economic policies. In the following paragraphs weconsider:(i) some aspects of domestic policies;(ii) some general questions of external economic policy;(iii) a number of directions in which commercial policies might be pursued;(iv) some aspects of agricultural policy.
(i) Domestic policies27. It is not possible to discuss here in detail what UK domestic policiesmight be in particular situations which might develop in the longer term. Forthe next few years the UK&apos;s main concern will be to achieve faster and steadiergrowth and with a healthier balance of payments than in the past, when theaverage growth rate has been less than 3 per cent per annum and the UK has suffered recurrent balance of payments crises. To the extent that theGovernments policies are successful &quot; Abstention &quot; will present the UK with no new problems. Moreover the Government have already embarked on long-termpolicies designed to increase UK economic and industrial efficiency, and these maybe assumed to continue. Whether the UK is part of a regional grouping or not,the Government will need to encourage considerable structural changes in our economy, and the freer the pattern of world trade that develops, the moreresponsive our policies will have to be. To secure the most favourable prospects for growth, it will be necessary to ensure that the UK is competitive in theproduction of those goods for which overseas demand is growing quickly, andthat too much manpower and investment is not committed to the decliningsectors. Positive action may also be required in order to ensure that UK firms are big enough to compete successfully. Experience to date suggests thateconomies of scale in the widest sense are already an important factor in the performance of several capital or technologically intensive industries, such ascomputers, motor cars and petrochemicals. It may be that in so far asmembership of a new trade grouping would have provided a helpful stimulus to the restructuring of industry this would have to be replaced by internal policies.These might be primarily aimed at raising the efficiency of management and investment, but could also extend to decisions as to the pattern of industrialspecialisation that should be encouraged, for this would then be more within our control.28. Since the main expanding markets for manufactures are likely to beprovided by other developed countries, UK trading success will largely depend onperformance in their markets; if the UK does badly there it will not be possibleto achieve a satisfactory total trade by exports elsewhere. Since the UK will not enjoy the stimulus which might arise from membership of a new trade grouping,it may be necessary.to pursue still more vigorous policies at home and abroad topromote competitiveness in all overseas markets.29. One consideration in the case of &quot; Abstention &quot; is that, as compared withmembership of any new grouping such as the e.c. or AFTA, the UK would notbe acquiring any new institutional constraints which might prevent the adoptionof particular policies for dealing, for example, with balance of payments problems.The UK would be as free as it is now. That freedom is, of course, far fromabsolute; it is always tempered by the consciousness that, firstly, the government must so far as possible avoid restrictive action&apos;since it is in this country&apos;s interest that others should pursue liberal policies, and that secondly, UK policy, as isthat of other countries, is subject to international surveillance, the extent of whichis generally more likely to grow than to diminish (and which is always bound topress harder on a debtor than on a creditor).(ii) External economic policies30. It was stated in Section A that UK growth and prosperity depended among other things on there being steadily expanding markets for UK exports. there seems a good chance that this condition will be fulfilled and that the UK willcontinue to have access on reasonable terms to the large and growing markets ofthe industrial countries. So far as the e.c. and the US are concerned tariff barriers are not high; indeed they are historically low, and they may be significantly reduced if the Kennedy Round is successful. It would continue to be a majorobjective of UK policy to maintain harmonious relations with these countries which provide markets for almost a third of UK exports and to work for the reduction ofbarriers to trade with them.31. We expect that free trade will be maintained with at least the moreimportant EFTA countries, and we assume that the UK will want to keep EFTAas a central element in its external economic policies. To achieve this the UK maywell have to agree to give greater content to the Stockholm Convention; the
disadvantages resulting from the additional obligations which other efta countries might seek to introduce would have to be weighed against the value tothis country of preserving EFTA.(iii) Commercial policy32. It follows from the argument in Section A (that UK growth depends onlow barriers against both UK exports and UK imports) that the Government shouldcontinue to pursue policies directed towards reducing tariff and non-tariff barrierson the widest possible basis. To move in the direction of autarky would mean thatthe UK would deny itself the benefits of international specialisation and economies of scale which are becoming increasingly important in international economic relations. Autarky would also create dangers for this country in that othercountries and groups might be encouraged to do likewise and that the extent towhich it would insulate the UK against developments in the rest of the world isvery limited. Nevertheless, the rejection of autarky does not necessarily rule outthe selective pursuit of some degree of industrial protection or import substitution.The UK would, however, have to guard against prejudicing broader economic objectives, and we conclude that having regard to this country&apos;s longer-term interestsit would not pay to depart significantly from the general principles ofnon-discrimination and the pursuit of lower barriers to trade within an agreedsystem of international rules and obligations.33. This does not mean, however, that the means of pursuing UK commercialobjectives would necessarily be the same as they have been up to now, and anyway the existing internationally accepted rules and obligations which now governinternational trade may change, at least in detail. For example, a multilateral trade and tariff negotiation on the scale of the Kennedy Round is unlikely tobe repeated at least for a considerable time to come and it may well be that futurenegotiations will return to the narrower and more selective form of earlier GATTnegotiations or that new methods and techniques will be devised.34. There are a variety of ways in which the UK might seek to improve its position within the general framework described above.35. The UK is already establishing close commercial and technological links with e.c. countries in the field of aircraft production, because this is an industryin which economies of scale in production and marketing are clearly of immenseimportance and also because it is an industry in which Governments are closelyinvolved. There are other industries in the same category (computers and nuclear energy, for example) in which similar arrangements might be made. In many important industrial fields enterprises have more and more to plan on the basisof world-wide operations, and in these areas great international corporations, suchas Shell, Unilever and Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), assume an increasinglydominant role. The Government could therefore adopt a positive policy of promoting the development of such enterprises and of encouraging them to centretheir operations in Britain. On a more modest scale companies could developtechnical and marketing co-operation arrangements with foreign companies, andin some areas it might be possible to organise joint research and productionarrangements. This is particularly the case with firms in e.c. countries but thereare already strong technological links with US firms, notably through licensingarrangements, as in computers and electronic control systems. Where an industryis heavily dependent on the Government for research financing and as a purchaser,the Government can, as in the defence field and aircraft, play a positive role in bringing about joint research, development and marketing arrangements with oneor more overseas partners. This not only shares the R and D costs and the risks involved, but widens the market possibilities and, in particular, may give the UKfirms access to the European or the US market, notably in the public sector, on terms more favourable than would otherwise be possible. As part of this generalpolicy of strengthening the technological base of the UK economy, the government might also adopt a more positive policy of attracting overseas enterprises to thiscountry.36. There is the possibility that in the future the reduction of trade barriersmight be more manageably negotiated through sectoral arrangements coveringparticular sectors of trade or products rather than by across-the-board reductions;for example, in motor cars or other manufactured goods where a very large market was considered essential for the development of modern productive techniques.
However, the scope for deals of this kind is likely to be limited, not least becauseof balance of interests which both sides would regard as fair would be difficultto achieve. Even if, say, the Europeans were prepared to contemplate such arrangements, they might wish them to be on a preferential basis; this would be strongly opposed by other countries, particularly the US, as being a significantbreach of non-discriminatory rules. Thus the UK would have to consider carefullywhether the direct advantages gained from such arrangements might be outweighed by the effect they might have on relations with other customers of importance andalso by the possibility that they might encourage the development elsewhere ofpreferential arrangements which would operate to the disadvantage of this country.37. The less developed countries now take one quarter of UK exports,divided almost equally between Commonwealth and foreign countries. As a group they are likely to continue expanding relatively slowly and to restrict imports to what they regard as essentials. Their capacity to import is largelydetermined by the level and stability of the prices of primary products, theexpansion of their exports of manufactured goods, and by the aid they receive.It is Government policy to provide development aid, and to encourage othercountries to do so, and this is regarded as being in the UK&apos;s long-term economic interests, because of the expansion of international trade to which it may lead.The amount of aid the ldc&apos;s receive and the conditions attached to it are boundto influence their commercial policies significantly. In general, however, the uk. could expect no substantial improvement in its export prospects from anythingit could reasonably offer them. This country would stand to lose from anymovement by the US or the e.c. (or possibly even the Eastern bloc) to use theirsuperior economic strength and the aid they could give to obtain preferredpositions in the markets of the developing countries. Rather than seek apreferred position in these markets in competition with the large units with more attractive markets than that of the UK it might be more in this country&apos;s interestto accept some erosion of its existing preferences, if this were necessary to ensurecompetition on equal terms with the US and the e.c. in the developing countries as a whole. In any case some further erosion of the UICs large share of theimport markets in Commonwealth ldc&apos;s is only to be expected.38. The Commonwealth ldc&apos;s already enjoy free access to the UK market for virtually all the products in which they are interested, with the exceptionof some textiles (including jute goods). But there is some scope for the UK toencourage them to produce more low-cost manufactures for its market, thushelping to release resources for more technologically advanced activities. Itwould thus help to increase UK production of new products and would increasethe purchasing power of the developing countries. This country could hope forsome balance of payments advantages on both counts. There would be domesticdifficulties, arising out of any significant rise in low-cost imports, which wouldbe different in kind from, though not necessarily any greater than, those thatwould accompany structural change consequent on joining a larger grouping suchas an AFTA or the e.c..39. Trade with all Commonwealth countries (including the less developed)accounted in 1965 for some 30 per cent of our exports and it is clearly in the uk&apos;s interests to maintain a favourable position in these markets for as long aspossible. Nevertheless, the UK position has been steadily eroded and this process is likely to continue. From time to time consideration has been givento seeking ways in which intra-Commonwealth trade might be expanded to theadvantage of the UK, but on the whole the results have not been promising.40. Should the UK not enter any large economic grouping the Governmentshould aim to maintain as much as possible of the Commonwealth preferencesystem for as long as possible and to exploit as far as possible this country&apos;position as a major market for Commonwealth countries&apos; exports. The UK&apos;shand would be strengthened in this if the Government were prepared to makefundamental changes in their Commonwealth policy and to put tariffs on selectedimports from some or all Commonwealth countries. It might be possible then to negotiate fresh benefits for some UK exports in some Commonwealth markets.On recent experience, however, there is no reason to expect that most other commonwealth countries would be willing to increase preferences or enter into closer trading arrangements with the UK; Canada and Australia, who are themost important UK markets in the Commonwealth, have been seeking markets
elsewhere and bargaining away the preferences which they give to this country,since they appear to regard the potentialities of expanding markets elsewhereas more important to them than maintaining a preferential position in the UK.41. UK trade with Eastern bloc countries has been expanding in recentyears, but in total these markets are still relatively unimportant, taking only about 3 per cent of UK total exports. Nevertheless, because of their largepopulations and the present low level of their trade with non-communist countries, they might eventually offer very large potential markets. Althoughchanges are taking place in their systems of economic management which mayin the long run lead to substantial changes in the pattern of their foreign trade,it is still too early to predict either the effect or the time scale of these developments. Moreover, limits are set to the prospects of their increasing theirUK earnings because the UK cannot increase its imports of those products which they might wish to send here in greater quantities (e.g., oil and foodstuffs)without detriment to other UK objectives. Their main export requirements inUK markets would be for primary products, including such basic commodities as bacon and pigmeat, dairy products and beef, for which this country cannotoffer greatly increased opportunities without frustrating the Governments efforts to expand production and save imports, or damaging UK trading relationships with other major suppliers of those commodities, or both. To a lesser extent they have an interest in increasing their exports of a selective range of processedfoodstuffs, but the opportunities for expansion in that field are limited and couldnot be expected substantially to increase their earnings in the UK. In any eventthey already pre-empt a substantial proportion of these earnings for purchaseof raw materials from the outer sterling area. These considerations suggestthat in the short term the Eastern bloc countries are not likely to become majormarkets for UK exporters although they possess growth prospects in the very long term.42. It is possible that unilateral tariff cuts by the UK could encouragespecialisation and increase the stimulus to industry of foreign competition,although it would, of course, be giving this country only part of the gains fromfreer trade (there would be no increase in the size of its markets) and could inthe short run be damaging to the balance of trade. While there might be somescope for this kind of action in a few sectors which would be to the advantageof the UK it is clear that it would normally be in its interest to secure themaximum possible reciprocity for such reductions.(iv) Agriculture43. The general principles set out in paragraph 9 apply to trade in agricultural as in industrial products. Nevertheless there is no doubt that the UKdoes possess a substantial technical capability to increase home agricultural output and among the policies which the Government may seek to pursue is that of import substitution in agriculture. Even assuming the present balance and structure of the industry (and including the attainment of the present selective expansion programme) it would be physically possible to secure in time asubstantial import saving. The cost of doing so, in terms of resources, wouldprobably not be prohibitive. But the net benefit to the balance of payments would be very much smaller than the gross import saving.44. A deliberate decision to seek the maximum programme of import savingfor agriculture would mean that the UK would have to go back in some measureat least on existing obligations and commitments to other countries, especially theCommonwealth, the Irish Republic and EFTA. It would also be necessary to depart significantly from the general principles to which the UK has subscribedin the GATT and to be ready to contemplate a series of restrictions on importswhilst deliberately encouraging the expansion of home production.45. At the same time, however, the UK could expect strong pressures from denmark and from the Irish Republic, if they too were unable to enter the e.c.,to improve their position as agricultural exporters to the UK market by providingthem with what they would regard as more nearly equal terms of competition with British farmers. Given that neither country had much to hope for in EECmarkets their efforts would be intensified to strengthen the agricultural content of efta and of the Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.   As regards Commonwealth
agricultural exporters, it is to be expected that they would continue where possibleto diversify their market outlets so as to strengthen their own economies. But theywould continue also to look to the UK food market; this applies particularly to new Zealand and the Caribbean countries in view of their heavy dependence onthe UK market for their exports of foodstuffs.46. The general situation, therefore, is that although the UK would in anyforeseeable circumstances be likely to continue as a substantial net importer of food and feeding stuffs it would remain under great pressure to restrain domestic production well below the maximum technically feasible. And for the reasons give above the UK could not hope to secure anything like the maximum import saving possible without wrecking most if not all of its existing trade agreements with the Commonwealth, the Irish Republic and EFT A. However, given technicalcapabilities the UK would be able, over a period, to produce a higher proportionof its food at home at an acceptable cost in resources and without serious effects on relations with supplying countries.Summary on &quot; Abstention &quot;47. If this country were to abstain from membership of a new regional economic grouping in the kind of situation discussed in paragraphs 18 and 19 itwould not mean that there would be no need for change in the structure of the economy. Certain external stimuli to industrial change which might otherwise have existed would not be present, but this would only mean that where possiblethe UK would have to do more itself in domestic and external policies. Industrialprocesses are becoming more complex and many of the major growth industriesrequire large and growing markets in order to reap the advantages of technologicalprogress and increasing economies of scale. The other major industrial powers the US, the e.c. and the Soviet Union may well become increasingly formidablecompetitors. Great changes will be necessary in the UK&apos;s industrial structure,and the UK may need to pursue with more vigour the policies already adopted inorder to bring them about. It will not be possible for the UK to avoid the needfor these changes by changes in commercial policy nor, in the view of the Committee,is there any alternative commercial policy which would do more to help the UKto pay its way and to improve its standard of living.48. If the world develops in a liberal way, however, there is no reason tobelieve that the UK economy could not grow at a satisfactory rate with externalstability; the extent of that growth would depend primarily on the Government^policies. There remains the risk that the world will develop in an illiberal way and that the UK&apos;s relative economic position as a highly diversified world tradingeconomy may deteriorate in relation to the larger economic blocs. TheGovernment will therefore need to do what is possible to prevent this fromhappening and to diminish any tendency for the UK to become isolated. In the longer term it should be possible to develop markets in the developing countries and in Eastern Europe, while the UK&apos;s remaining preferential links with theCommonwealth, UK membership of EFTA, functional arrangements with the e.c.,harmonious relations with the US, and continued membership and active support for international economic institutions are all valuable safeguards which the UKshould aim to preserve and, if possible, to strengthen.C.   ATLANTIC FREE TRADE AREA49. As stated in paragraph 1 of this report, the Committee was asked &quot; to study the implications for the economic policies and prospects of the UnitedKingdom of membership of a North Atlantic Free Trade Area &quot; (the Javits Plan).Our main study has therefore been confined strictly to economic matters. We havenot attempted to answer the key question whether it would be in the UK&apos;s political interest to join an AFTA. We have, however, included as Annex II a note bythe Foreign Office and the Commonwealth Office on the present attitude of theUnited States and Commonwealth countries concerned towards a proposition ofthis kind.50. In the speech which Senator Javits m^de to the United States Senate inAugust 1965, he recommended that &quot; the United States should offer to enter
into a free trade area initially with Britain, then with Canada and, on a reciprocalbasis, with the other EFTA nations . . . with the members of the e.c., eitherindividually or as a unit, and with the other industrialised countries of the OECD.&quot;For the purpose of our study, however, it has been necessary to define the boundaries more precisely and to take greater account of political realities includingthe Commonwealth connection. As a working hypothesis we have assumed that membership of the AFTA would consist of the US, the UK, Canada, Denmark,Norway and Sweden, Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland.51.   Our other working assumptions are as follows:(a) All the members would join at the outset which we have taken as 1970.(b) The subsequent transitional period for the reduction of tariffs would lastuntil about 1975.(c) All tariffs would be removed from trade in industrial goods between members of the AFTA (subject to major exceptions for developingindustries in Australia and New Zealand); the treatment of non-tariff barriers would, however, be a matter for negotiation.id) Members would remain free, as at present, to pursue their own tariffpolicies vis-a-vis non-members (as in EFTA).(e) There would be some agricultural content to the AFTA, i.e., a considerableextension of trading opportunities in agricultural products.(/) The UK would be able to retain the present control over portfolio investment (the question whether the UK would be able to retain thepresent control over outward direct investment in member countries is considered in paragraph 75).ig) International monetary arrangements would provide for a reasonablystable relationship between the pound and the dollar and each country would have confidence in the otheris currency.52. We have approached our task from two different angles. First, atheoretical analysis was undertaken on a macro-economic basis; this was concernedwith the effect of an AFTA on the aggregate items in the UK&apos;s balance of tradeand capital movements in the short run and on the growth of output and productivity in the longer run. Secondly, an empirical study was made by production department of the implications of an AFTA for individual manufacturing industries,for coal and oil, and for a range of agricultural products. We have tried tosynthesize the results of both studies though without coming to a cut-and-driedconclusion. This inconclusiveness seems to us inevitable. No AFTA exists atpresent and none has been officially proposed. All free trade areas are what theyare negotiated to be. In an AFTA much would depend on the bargain that wasstruck on agriculture, on the treatment of non-tariff barriers and on capital movements. The UK would have the advantage of being in at the beginninginstead of being faced, as in the e.c., with a ready-made structure. But it wouldhave the the disadvantage of negotiating with one partner who was very much larger and stronger than the rest.53. This section of the report is divided into three parts. The first considers the effects of membership on the balance of payments in the short term, defined asbeing the end of the transitional period. The second part considers the implications of membership for the growth of productivity and real income in the longer term.That is the central issue. (It is implicit in the analysis that the UK is able tomaintain a sound balance of payments position in the longer term.) The third partconsiders the implications for the economic and financial management of the UK.Short-term effects on the balance of payments54. In order to assess the effects of an AFTA on the balance of payments on current account, we considered in some detail what would happen to the UK&apos;sbilateral trade with the US and also examined possible consequences to its tradewith other member countries, to particular industries, to coal and oil and to agriculture. An outline, of this study is set out in Annex I and the results are summarised in paragraphs 55-58 below. In paragraphs 59-63 we turn to the implications of an AFTA for direct investment by the US in the UK and by the uk in the US. We then try, in paragraph 64, to sum up the total effect on the uk balance of payments as a whole.
(i) Visible trade with AFTA countries55. Trade in manufactured goods between the UK and the US is at presentroughly in balance. The removal of tariffs on these goods would lead both toan increase in UK exports to the US and to an increase in US exports to the UK.Whose exports would rise the most? The answer would be determined mainly by the following factors:(a) Level of existing tariff barriers between the two countries: the UK andthe US both impose a wide range of tariffs on imports of manufacturedgoods; at present US tariffs probably have a more restrictive effect onthe bilateral trade than UK tariffs so that the UK&apos;s exports might risemore than its imports if tariffs were removed.(b) Treatment of non-tariff barriers: both countries also have other practices(e.g., direct restrictions on trade in coal and oil, discrimination in the placing of public contracts, etc.) which act as barriers to trade; thesebarriers are much more extensive in the US than in the UK. Thiscountry would therefore stand to gain if they were all removed but would be at a continuing disadvantage if, as seems probable, most ofthem were retained.(c) Elasticity of demand, i.e., the responsiveness of demand in each countryto a change in the price of manufactured goods: the elasticity of USdemand for UK exports is probably greater than that of UK demandfor US exports but opinions vary as to the degree of difference.(d) Elasticity of supply, i.e., the relative ease or difficulty which each country has in increasing the output of manufactured goods: in the short-term,the ability of US producers to increase output (in response to anincrease in demand) is probably greater than that of UK producers.Most of the Committee think that the chances are that in bilateral trade inmanufactures UK exports would gain more than US exports; some think thatthis net gain might be quite substantial; others would not rule out the possibilityof a net loss.56. The UK would probably achieve a net increase in exports in the generalfield of higher quality consumer goods where the balance of trade is alreadyfavourable and the UK has a cost advantage. In the capital goods field therewould be gains to each side but the net movement would probably be in favourof the US because of their advantages in technology and scale of production.The US would probably gain on balance in chemicals because in major sectorsthey have lower raw material costs, a larger scale of production and higherresearch expenditure. On the other hand the UK would probably gain on tradein iron and steel products. On coal and oil, taken together, an AFTA wouldprobably make little practical difference to the UK trade balance: this country would lose by removing its present embargo frn imports of US coal but gain ifthe US removed their restrictions on imports of crude oil and products.57. In all the other countries which (it is assumed) would join an AFTA Norway, Sweden and Denmark, the Irish Republic, Canada, Australia, NewZealand the UK at present enjoys a tariff preference on manufactured goodsas compared with the US. The UK would lose its preferred position in thesecountries vis-a-vis the US. There are several important fields (e.g., some chemicaland engineering products) in which competition on equal terms might lead toa loss of trade from UK to US exporters. Thus an AFTA could be expectedto have an adverse effect on the UK&apos;s overall balance of trade with membersother than the US.58. Apart, from this country, nearly all the assumed members of AFTAwould be large net exporters of agricultural products. There would thereforebe strong pressure for the AFTA to have an &quot; agricultural content &quot;. The UKwould probably have to modify the agricultural support system so as to admitlarger imports of meat, dairy products, fish and fruit. In addition, if the kennedy round had not produced an agreement on cereals or if it had produced a compromise which the exporters regarded as unsatisfactory the US, Canada and australia would demand further concessions from the UK, on prices and accessas a condition of entry to an AFTA. That could be an expensive addition tothe UK&apos;s import bill.
(ii) Capital movements between the UK and US59. There are no formal restrictions by the US on direct investment in the uk though such investment may be marginally affected for the time being bythe Presidents Voluntary Restraint Programme. US direct investment in thiscountry is already running at about  120 million a year out of about  160 million for direct inward investment from all sources. There are some reasons forexpecting that US direct investment here would increase in the event of the UKjoining an AFTA and some reasons for supposing that it would fall.60. Reasons for expecting an increase: US subsidiaries in the UK areprofitable. They are able to operate with lower unit costs than within the USmainly because wage levels are lower here than there, whereas US managerialknow-how and production techniques are in advance of those in this country.At present most US subsidiaries in this country can only sell to the US over a tariff barrier (though there are some cases where the US tariff is small ornon-existent on the products of US subsidiaries in the UK). If this barrierwere removed, some perhaps many US firms would find it more profitable tosupply the US market from the UK instead of from the US itself. This could lead to a substantial increase in US direct investment in this country, particularly if there were political encouragement from the US, arising from the circumstances in which an AFTA was brought into being.61. Reasons for expecting a fall:The production and sale of goods by theirsubsidiaries in this country gives US firms access beneath the tariff barrier to the uk market. If the tariff were removed, some US firms might switch to supplying the UK market direct from their home base. The same would apply to production which they now carry out in the UK for sales in the Commonwealth(duty free or at a preferential rate) and in the rest of EFTA (duty free).Similarly, at present some US capital may be attracted here because the UK is seen as a prospective member of the e.c. so that a US subsidiary in this country could hope to duck beneath the eec&apos;s common external tariff. If this prospectdisappeared, US firms might tend to invest direct in e.c. countries instead.62. The Committee have been unable to reach agreement on which of thetwo sets of factors (in paragraphs 60 and 61) would be dominant. Some membersthink that the added incentive for US firms to produce in the UK for the USmarket would far outweigh other factors, and lead to a substantial increase in theinflow of US capital. Others think that it would be less important than the factors reducing the need for US firms to produce in the UK and that US direct investment in the UK would therefore tend to fall off. It needs to be rememberedthat, the larger the inflow of capital, the larger the annual payment that wouldhave to be made across the exchanges in the form of interest, profits and dividends. This sum might be a relatively small proportion of the capital inflowat the end of the tranisitional period but it would continue and accumulate overthe years.63. The total effect of an AFTA on the movement of long-term capital would also depend on whether the UK removed its present exchange controlrestrictions on direct investment in the US and Canada and on whether the&quot; voluntary programme&quot; to curb investment in the old Commonwealth was brought to an end. We refer in paragraph 75 to the question whether the UKwould have to remove these restrictions, if this had not already been done. TheirTT^0^ wou^ *ead t0 some increase in outward direct investment since someUK firms would set up subsidiaries in the US and Canada in order to get nearer to their supplies of raw materials and to build up a better sales organisation fortheir exports. On the other hand it would be cheaper for some British firms tosupply the US market from the UK instead of from existing UK subsidiaries inthe US and this would be a factor in the other direction. So would any fall indirect investment in Canada, Australia or New Zealand.(iii) Balance of payments as a whole64. Uncertainty about the implications of an AFTA for the UK visible tradeand capital account prevents us from reaching an agreed conclusion about theenect on the balance of payments as a whole. (The result might also be affectedoy political decisions, e.g., on defence, which would change the pattern of the UK&apos;s
overseas expenditure.) Some members of the Committee would expect a gain, andpossibly quite a substantial gain to the balance of payments. They consider thatthis would occur from(a) a larger increase in UK exports of industrial goods to the US than inUS exports to the UK;(b) a net increase in the inflow of US capital to the UK;and that these benefits would probably outweigh the losses to be expected in(c) UK exports of industrial goods to other countries in the AFTA;(d) increased imports of agricultural products by the UK;(e) increased &quot; invisible &quot; payments by the UK on account of interest and dividends;(/) a larger net outflow of capital from the UK to the US (if restrictions on direct investment were removed).Most members of the Committee dissent from that view. Some would go so faras to expect a loss to the UK in its trade with the US and on capital account, inaddition to the unfavourable factors listed at (c) to (/) above. Other memberstake the view that the range of possibilities on each item is so wide that it isimpossible to say whether there would be a significant improvement or a significantworsening in the balance of payments as a whole; they consider that both extremesseem equally likely and so does any point between them.Longer term effects65. The discussion in the first part of this Section was on the basis of an analysis of short-term changes in trade and capital flows resulting from thecreation of an AFTA. The changes in the economic structure implied in this analysis are significant but they are small in relation to the changes which wouldtake place over a longer period as a result of a closer economic relationship betweenthe UK and the US to which the free trade area would be bound in time to giverise. It would make increasingly less sense for the UK to operate an &quot; all-purpose &quot;economy. Instead it would be necessary for the UK to direct a greater proportionof its resources into industries which could sell a large part of their output in theUS, and to replace former domestic production with imports from the US.66. In looking to a period perhaps 15 or 20 years after the formation of anAFTA, any judgment about the structural effects on the economy is necessarilyvery uncertain and subjective. The Committee was unable to reach agreement on whether on balance they would be beneficial to the UK. It was agreed, however,that the main considerations would be the effects on the UK industrial structure of the pattern of specialisation, the opportunities for reaping economies of scale,and the size and direction of the capital flows, which would result from theformation of the free trade area.67. One view was that there would be a large increase in the real income ofthe UK. This would come about in three ways. First the UK would tend tospecialise in those industries in which it had a comparative advantage over theUS, and could divert resources away from industries where it was relatively less efficient than the US. The redeployment of resources into the more efficientindustries and the replacement of less efficient production by cheaper imports would lead to a genuine gain in real incomes. Secondly, the association with theUS would provide free access to a very much larger market for UK industry, and(together with specialisation) would enable this country to reap economies of scale which are at present outside its grasp. Furthermore, the increased strength ofUK industries in the new situation would make it possible for them to devote moreresources to research and development and so by reaping &quot; economies of advancingtechnology &quot; still further to strengthen their position. Thirdly, the association ofthe UK with a country with much higher productivity and wage levels would attract capital and industrial &quot; know-how &quot; into the UK to take advantage of lower wages here to produce not only for the UK market but also in some casesfor the US market as well. The fact that the productivity and profitability of UKsubsidiaries of US firms is substantially higher on average than that of UK firmsmay be an indication of the importance of this factor. The changes in the structure of British industry consequent upon the formation of an EFTA would thus leadto an increase in the rate of growth of UK productivity and real income.
68. Other members of the Committee felt that in the longer term theadvantages to this country were considerably less certain in the light of the relativestrengths and structures of the UK and US economies. The pattern ofspecialisation towards which the UK economy would move, might be disadvantageous in terms of future growth. The industries in which the UK wouldappear to have advantages over industries in the US are to a considerable extentthose in the field of high quality consumer goods and other relatively labourintensive products where in recent years both home and export demand have been growing more slowly than the average for manufacturing industry as a whole.Moreover, they are mainly industries where productivity is lower than averageand where the returns to scale and opportunities for technological economies are more limited.69. There is also a great deal of uncertainty about the extent to which in the longer run the UK would be the recipient of a continued inflow of US capital and what its effects would be. Some of the factors which have encouraged suchinvestment in the past (see paragraph 61 above) would no longer be operating.There is also some evidence that the profitability of US investment in the UK,although still appreciably higher than that of UK firms generally, has been tending to decline. This relative profitability may have been exaggerated in the past sincethe costs of US subsidiaries often exclude a charge for research and development and other overhead costs which are borne by the parent company in the US.Nothing is known about the comparative profitability of new manufacturing capacity in the same industries in the US and the UK with overhead costs (suchas research and development expenses) continuing to be borne where they were previously.70. A large increase in US investment in UK industry would also be boundto raise difficult questions of policy towards foreign firms in the UK. The recent report to Ministers of an ad hoc Group on Inward Investment (EN (67) 21)proposed that where an inward investment might lead to an important sector ofBritish industry coming under foreign control, might damage the developmentof British technology, or might frustrate an officially sponsored scheme forreorganising an important sector of British industry, the Government should beprepared to take action to prevent the investment if the balance of advantage werejudged adverse. (These recommendations were, subject to certain qualifications,approved by Ministers.) An increase in US investment in the UK sufficient to change the character of the UK economy could not avoid raising these questions inacute form. On the other hand the report pointed out that in general inwardinvestment was beneficial to the UK economy and that it would be important toavoid doing any thing to inhibit the general run of it.71. Changes in the structure of the UK economy and in the degree and direction of US penetration of British industry would also be reflected in the structure of UK trade, not only with the US but also, with third countries inside and outside the free trade area to whom at present the UK sends 90 per cent of its exports. Some UK industries, which had benefited from specialisation, oran infusion of US capital and enterprise, would become more competitive and their exports would increase. Other industries would be likely to shrink and become less competitive so that their exports would fall. Closer association with the us would lead the UK to specialise in those industries, which, when tariffs areremoved, can compete most successfully with US manufactures; but the productsconcerned will not always be those in which the UK can compete most successfullywith outside suppliers in third markets. It is not possible to say where the finalbalance of advantage and disadvantage would rest. Clearly, changes in thelong-term pattern of world demand for particular types of product would be ofgreat importance, but the same uncertainties as surround the possible effects onour industrial structure would apply.72. The impact of increased payments of interest, profits and dividends, inrespect of increased US investment, would also have to be taken into account inthe longer term. (Whether the US would be willing to allow a large increase inthe capital outflow to the UK-currently running at about  120 million a year-is, of course, another question; but to the extent that the UK was prepared to holddollars rather than change them into gold the problem for the US would be eased.)If the current inflow of US capital were to be doubled (i.e., if there were animprovement in the capital account of  100-150 million a year), the additionalSECRET7739 r
debit at the end of 10 years would be of the order of  50-100 million a year (andthe proportion of UK manufacturing industry under US control would be increased from about 7 per cent to substantially over 10 per cent); this figure is not large inrelation to total trade, but it would represent an additional and continuingconstraint on the economy.Balance of advantages73. The changes which would take place over time in the structure of the uk economy as a result of the creation of an AFTA would undoubtedly beprofound; but it is much more difficult to predict with any confidence how farthey would be beneficial and how far detrimental. Some members of theCommittee believed that there were good grounds for expecting that the opportunities for specialisation and the economies of scale resulting from greatlyenlarged markets would produce a big increase in real income; and that lower UKwage costs might well attract US capital and so make possible some furtheracceleration in the growth of UK productivity. On the other hand others feltthat in view of the very different economic structures of the two countries therewere reasons to doubt this optimistic expectation; they recognised that even within industries which would, on the whole, suffer, there are some firms which would be efficient enough to benefit from the new opportunities, and thatsome of the more labour-intensive industries, in which the UK could be expectedto specialise, are fast-growing ones; but even so, in their view, it seemed likely thatunfavourable movements in the pattern of industrial specialisation in the UKwould on balance result in a loss.74. The advantages and disadvantages of UK membership of an AFTAmight be in balance, with the rate of growth of real income virtually unchanged;but the range of possibilities is wide. At best the UK would become much richer;but changes in the structure of the UK economy could well be the source of difficulties, and by linking its economy more closely to that of the US, the UKwould be likely to suffer more seriously from any recessions in the US than would otherwise have been the case.Implications for economic and financial management75. The formation of an AFTA would not involve many of the limitations onmember Governments&apos; freedom of action in the field of economic policy that are inherent in customs unions and closer forms of economic union. For example, in contrast to what might be expected if the UK joined the e.c., it would be possiblefor the UK Government to decide the structure and balance of UK taxation, andthere should be no difficulty about paying investment grants, including the regional supplements, and levying the selective employment tax. The&quot; agricultural content &quot; of an AFTA would, however, almost certainly be animportant constraint in the longer run on the expansion of UK agricultural production. Moreover other instruments of policy which have a direct externalimpact would be called into question in the negotiations for establishing an AFTA.It seems certain that export rebates would be disallowed at least in respect of tradewithin the area, and the selective employment premium might also becomevulnerable. Most members of the Committee agreed that outward direct investment would have to be liberalised, since the US would hardly be able toaccept a position where there was a significant increase in the capital flow to the uk (which would be very important if the UK were to benefit, on balance, froman AFTA) while UK restrictions effectively prevented any movement in the opposite direction unless financed by portfolio disinvestment.76. The creation of an AFTA would in practice be likely to entail severerestraints on the management of the UK balance of payments. The terms of theAssociation could be expected to provide for temporary quantitative restrictionson imports to meet serious balance of payments difficulties, but there would obviously be great pressure on all members to avoid using them. Too readyrecourse by any member country would call in question the value to other membersof that country&apos;s membership. At the same time, it would be very, much in theinterest of the UK to avoid provisions which would allow member countries toimpose quantitative restrictions for other than balance of payments reasons;otherwise the US Administration, in particular, would be unlikely to resist internalpressure for the use of such provisions to protect particular interests.
77. As was made clear in an earlier section of this paper, the Committee took the view that an AFTA would only be likely to come into being following the breakdown of the present unified world monetary system (resulting from the breaking of the link between the dollar and gold). This was not to say, however,that a breakdown in the present unified world monetary system would necessarilylead, or even be likely to lead, to the formation of an AFTA. The world monetaryarrangements in the event of a breakdown would be likely to entail the linking of sterling to the dollar, and in due course the assimilation of the sterling system into that of the dollar. Even if, contrary to the expectation of the Committee, anAFTA did come into being without any sharp change in the world monetary system, it seems likely that there would be pressures in the same direction, thoughthe process of the assimilation of the sterling system into that of the dollar wouldprobably take longer. Either way there would need to be the closest co-operationbetween the US and the UK in the field of monetary policy and interest rates.Such close co-operation has in fact been the rule in the recent past as a result ofthe vulnerable position of both reserve currencies, so that the additional de factolimitation on the UK Government^ freedom to formulate its own policies wouldnot be significant.78. The creation of an AFTA would, then, leave the UK Government witha fair degree of apparent freedom on &quot; internal&quot; economic policies. the effectiveness of these policies would, however, be diminished in the new situation.The pattern of specialisation and the increasing reliance on a large market whereeconomic conditions were only marginally affected by UK policies would leave the uk economy much more open to changes in economic circumstances elsewhere.An enforced adjustment to a lower level of activity in the US would be difficult forthe UK since import restrictions could not readily be used to offset the deterioration in exports. Furthermore in so far as the creation of an AFTA was accompaniedby an increase in US penetration of important sectors of the UK economy, an increasing volume of decisions of great importance to the development of the UKeconomy would be taken on the basis of an assessment of the interests ofinternational corporations rather than of UK interests. Thus the level of activity in the UK would be substantially more dependent on the level of activity in theUS than it already is. There is no reason to expect that the US economy would be run at a low level of activity; but the decision on this would be entirely in UShands. These factors would result in the UK having significantly less control overthe development of its own economy than it has had in the past.D.   CONCLUDING REMARKS79. In this report we have tried to assess the economic implications for the uk both of abstention from any new economic grouping and of membership ofa possible AFTA. We have not made any systematic comparison between thesetwo courses, or between either of them and membership of e.c.. Any suchcomparison could only be in qualitative terms and would, at best, be highlyspeculative.80. In this concluding section of our report we review briefly the main issues which have arisen in considering &quot; Abstention &quot; and AFTA. We recognise that a balanced assessment of each course is not possible without consideration of the relevant political factors (which would have consequences in the economic as wellas in the political and defence fields). However, the Committee felt that its termsof reference did not permit discussion of these factors, and so we do not attemptin this report to take any account of them.&quot; Abstention &quot;81. Our assessment of probable future trends suggests that there is a fairprospect that world trading and monetary conditions will remain liberal and thatthe continuing growth of demand in other countries will lead to expanding markets for UK exports, though the outcome of the Kennedy Round and of the discussions on liquidity may affect this assessment. Whatever the external trading conditions,this country will need to pursue internal policies which will make industry more efficient and more competitive in international markets.   Subject to these two
conditions, the UK should be able to prosper and enjoy a satisfactory rate ofeconomic growth without joining any wider economic grouping.82. This does not mean that there would be no need for change in the structure of the UK economy. Because of technological advance and the growing complexity of industrial processes, a country increasingly requires a large market in order to benefit from economies of scale and of specialisation. The UK would have to take action to rationalise its industrial structure and to increase the degree of industrialspecialisation. And it would have to do so without the stimulus of free access to a market much larger than that offered by the surviving members of EFTA and theIrish Republic. This market would however be augmented by such preferentialarrangements as could be maintained or negotiated in the Commonwealth and bythe general assurance of a reasonable level of tariffs provided by the GATT bindingswhich already exist and which would result from a successful Kennedy Round.Although some action in the field of commercial policy might be possible to accelerate changes in the industrial structure, there is no commercial policy whichwould compensate for failure to ensure that industry was efficient and competitive.83. A central question would be whether the prospect of UK membership of the e.c. should be put aside. In this study we have discussed possible courses of action which the UK might pursue on the assumption that membership of the eec would not be available in the foreseeable future. It would have to berecognised that if Ministers wished to keep open the possibility of eventualmembership this might involve a price in the form of limitations on the country&apos;sfreedom of action. These would apply to overseas expenditure and to commercial and domestic policy.84. Non-participation in a wider economic grouping would limit theinterdependence of the UK economy and those of other potential partners. But itwould not enforce and need not lead to economic isolation: the UK would stillbe important as a trading partner to the US and the e.c., and there is no reasonto expect that new barriers would be erected against its trade with either of them.Such a situation would deny the UK the new stimulus to economic co-operationwith other countries, both at Government level and between individual firms, which some see as a prime economic advantage of membership of the e.c.. However,the existing international machinery for economic co-operation and particularlythat in OECD, GATT, IMF and EFTA-would remain and it would be in theinterests of both the UK and other countries that it should continue to functioneffectively.Atlantic Free Trade Area85. It seems to us that an AFTA would only come into being in circumstances in which there was little prospect of the economic integration of Western Europethrough UK membership of the e.c., little progress in the reduction of tariffs ona GATT basis and (probably) in which the world was divided into two monetaryblocs. Even then, neither the e.c. nor the US would benefit from ignoring the trading opportunities provided by the other, but their trading relations with eachother and with the rest of the world would tend to be less liberal than at present.If, however, the UK joined an AFTA which would, by definition, be a largetrading bloc its prosperity would be less dependent on the pursuit of liberal policiesby the rest of the world than in the &quot; Abstention &quot; situation.86. We have tried to make a judgment about the probable effect of an AFTAon the UK balance of payments in the short term but we are unable to reach an agreed conclusion. Some members of the Committee would expect a distinctimprovement in the trade balance with the US and a net increase in the inflowof US capital which together would be sufficient to outweight the loss of exportsto third markets and the inevitable cost to the UK of giving an AFTA an&quot; agricultural content&quot;. Other views were that the total effect on the balance ofpayments might be adverse or that the result could not be predicted.87. Uncertainty about the effect of an AFTA on the net inflow of US capitalhas increased the difficulty of forecasting what might happen in the longer termto the rate of growth of productivity and output in the UK. And it is of course the longer term that matters most. Some of us believe that the longer-term effects of an AFTA would be to make the UK a richer but less economically independentcountry; others attach more weight to the evidence about the probable trend in
the pattern of UK specialisation, and doubt whether the effects of an AFTA wouldbe beneficial over a long period of time. But none of us can be sure becausesuch long-term forecasting is extremely uncertain.88. Membership of an AFTA would involve a fundamental change in the uk&apos;s economic relationships with the rest of the world. The UK would cease to be the dominant partner in important trading and monetary groupings EFTA,the Commonwealth and the sterling area. Instead the UK would be a relatively small partner in a grouping in which the principal member, the US, had a GNPwhich was eight times its own. The closer ties with the US might provide someopportunity to influence the course of their economic policy more directly but itis inconceivable that where economic interests were seriously in conflict the UScould be deflected from their chosen path. No doubt there would be some increasein UK influence on US economic policy but, of more importance, the developmentof the UK economy would be determined to a greater degree by forces outsidethe control of the UK Government.89. While we did not feel able to consider the acceptability of an AFTA to public opinion in the UK, it seemed unhelpful not to examine what is known aboutthe attitude of the Government of the US and of some of the other principalcountries involved in the idea of an AFTA. This is done in Annex II. Briefly,there is little prospect in the foreseeable future of securing the support of otherGovernments, especially that of the US, for the creation of such a free trade area.However, if the US and the UK were to decide to press ahead with such a scheme,a number of countries, while remaining unenthusiastic, would find it difficult tohold themselves aloof. The factors which would militate now against thenegotiability of an AFTA are very powerful. Among the most important arethe view of the US Administration that an AFTA is not &quot; realistic &quot; at the present justice and the effect of this on the other Governments concerned; the US concernat the dangers of international political and defence realignment that might followan AFTA; the US view that UK membership of the e.c. would afford advantages to the US which could not be secured by any alternative arrangement for the UK;the traditional unwillingness of the US to enter into trading arrangements involvingdiscrimination against some of their major trading partners; the uncertainty whetherthe Scandinavian countries would be able to contemplate membership of a tradinggroup which would set them apart from their very important e.c. trading partners;the political difficulty of omitting Japan from an AFTA and the economic problems which would be involved in her inclusion; the implications for US relations withLatin America of opening US markets to other advanced countries; the unwillingness of the Canadian Government to contemplate arrangements whichwould still further erode her economic independence; and the reluctance of theAustralian and New Zealand Governments to jeopardise their countries&apos; future prospects of industrial growth. This picture could alter if there were radical changes in world economic organisation; but we cannot at present foresee anysuch changes. ; -
ANNEX ISHORT-TERM IMPLICATIONS OF AN AFTA FOR UK TRADE WITHOTHER MEMBER COUNTRIESThis Annex gives an outline of our study of the short-term implications of anAFTA for the UK&apos;s bilateral trade with the US and for trade with other member countries. It also summarises the assessments made by production departments of the implications for the UK&apos;s trade in particular industrial goods, in coal and oil and in agriculture. The results of this work are summarised in paragraphs 54-58of our main report.UK trade with the US2. In 1965 the UK&apos;s total exports to the US were  500 million (fob) againstimports of  672 million (cif). Apart from insurance and freight, the difference was largely concentrated on trade in food and raw materials. In manufacturedgoods alone, after allowing for insurance and freight, the trade was roughly in balance: UK exports to the US were  400 million (fob) against imports of 434 million (cif). The removal of tariffs on industrial goods would lead both toan increase in UK exports to the US and to an increase in US exports to thiscountry. Whose exports would rise the most? The result would be determinedmainly by four factors:id) the level of existing tariffs between the two countries,ib) the treatment of non-tariff barriers,(c) the responsiveness of demand in each country to a change in the price of manufactured goods (the elasticity of demand),id) the relative ease or difficulty which each has in increasing the supply ofthose goods (the elasticity of supply).We consider each of these factors in turn.3. id) Tariffs. Both the UK and the US impose a wide range of tariffs on imports of manufactured goods. In 1965 the average rate (weighted by the levelof imports of each item) on UK imports from the US was about 12-14 per cent.It seems likely that the average rate on US imports of manufactures from the UKin 1965 was somewhat higher than 12-14 per cent. What is likely to matter inthe context of AFTA, however, is not the average level but the effect of individualtariffs on trade in products of current or prospective importance. On a broadrange of industrial machinery the tariffs of both countries are broadly similar andin the range of 10-20 per cent. These goods account for a considerable proportionof existing trade; the demand for them is relatively unresponsive to price changes(or price-inelastic) and removal of the tariffs, considered alone, might not have agreat effect on the balance of trade. On the other hand, the US tariff on a broadrange of consumer goods, for which demand should be relatively responsive to price changes (or price-elastic) tends to be high both absolutely and relatively tothe UK tariff. (A major exception to this is motor cars where the UK tariff is25 per cent and the US is 6 per cent.) The UK has a deficit with the US on tradein capital goods but a surplus on trade in consumer goods and so might expectits exports to rise more than its imports as a result of the removal of tariffs.4. ib) Non-tariff barriers. Tariffs are by no means the only or in some areas the most important barriers to trade. There are direct restrictions on trade in coal and oil (considered in paragraphs 14-15). In addition both countriesrestrict imports of various agricultural products by quotas. By means of subsidyarrangements and the reservation of coastal trade to ships built in the US, thatcountry makes it virtually impossible for UK ship-builders to supply ships. the uk limits the freedom of UK nationalised airlines to buy US aircraft. The USdiscriminates, by a system of wine gallon assessment for excise duties, againstUK bottled whisky, and administers anti-dumping duties in a manner which at
times inhibits imports. (These practices may, however, be changed as part of the kennedy Round.) In the UK, in practice, Government and public authoritycontracts are traditionally open to competition from foreign traders only to alimited extent. In the US this protection is formalised and carried much furtherby the &quot; Buy American &quot; legislation on Federal contracts. Moreover the Statesdiscriminate in favour of US products under their own laws (which are not subjectto the consent of the Federal Government). In principle all these barriers should go in a free trade area; in practice it is likely that many of them would remain.Since these barriers are much more extensive on the US side than on that of the uk, this country would stand to gain more than the US if they were removed but would be at a continuing disadvantage if they were retained.5. (c) Elasticity of demand. Since trade in manufactured goods between theUS and the UK is roughly in balance (see paragraph 2), and since the average levelof tariffs is not very different, the elasticity of demand would be the main factordetermining the rise in exports resulting from the abolition of tariffs. Some ofthe committee believe that the US elasticity of demand for UK exports would prove significantly greater than the UK elasticity of demand for US exports. Thereason lies in their belief that there is a tendency for the elasticity of demand fora suppliers product to be inversely related to his share of the market, and in thefact that UK exports to the US account for only about two-thirds of 1 per cent of us consumption of manufactured goods, while US exports to the UK account for about 4 per cent of UK consumption of manufactured goods. It is not argued that because the market shares are in the ratio of f: 4 or 1:6, therefore theelasticities would be in the ratio 6:1, but it is thought that they might be in the ratio 3:1. This theory leads to the conclusion that UK exports to the US would rise significantly more than US exports to the UK, with a consequent improvementin the UK trade balance. An alternative theory is that a relevant factor wouldnot be the relative proportions of the other country&apos;s market already satisfied,but the relative proportions not satisfied by the other country (i.e., the relationshipwould be 99J: 96 rather than f: 4). If this alternative theory were valid, therewould be no reason to expect any significant difference between the two elasticities.The view of many members of the Committee is, however, that both theories aboutthe elasticity of demand depend on models which do not correspond with the realworld. They consider that the US demand for UK goods may be somewhat moreelastic than the UK demand for US goods but that the difference is unlikely tobear any relation to the general share which each has in the other&apos;s market and itwill vary greatly from one product to another.6. (d) Elasticity of supply. The actual increase in trade would dependnot only on the change in demand but also on the amounts which could in practice be supplied. There is typically somewhat more spare capacity in industry inthe US than in the UK and in any case the total size of US industrial production is about five times as large as the total size of UK industrial production. In theearly years of an AFTA therefore US manufacturers would probably be in abetter position to meet the increase in demand likely in the UK than UKproducers would be to meet the increase in demand likely in the US. Thedifferent supply positions might also lead to differences in the pricing policy adopted by UK and US producers if tariffs were removed. The US producer,with more spare capacity, coud be expected to pass on more of the tariff reduction to his customers, i.e., to reduce his price more in the UK than the UK producerwould in the US. But although this factor would moderate the rise in the volume ofUK exports more than the rise in volume of US exports, there would be acorresponding rise in the value of exports, since money previously collected bythe US Customs would now be coming across the exchanges into the pockets ofUK producers. Moreover the greater profitability of exports from the UK tothe US that would be represented by a policy of not reducing market prices bythe full amount of the tariff might be expected to lessen any supply constraintsholding back these exports. Differences in the extent to which US and UKproducers reduce their market prices in response to tariff abolition would therefore have less effect on changes in the value of trade than on changes inits volume., 7. Thus the answer to our question in paragraph 2 whose exports would rise the most? must take account of the following factors. First, at presentUS tariffs probably have a more restrictive effect on the bilateral trade than UK
tariffs. Secondly, the US imposes more restrictive non-tariff barriers than the uk but it is doubtful whether they would be removed. Thirdly, the elasticity of us demand for UK goods is probably greater than that of UK demand for USgoods but opinions vary as to the degree of difference. Fourthly, the short-termability of US producers to increase output is probably greater than that of UKproducers. Most of the Committee think the chances are that in bilateral tradein manufacturers UK exports would gain more than US exports; some think thatthis net gain might be quite substantial; others would not rule out the possibilityof a net loss.UK trade with other members of AFTA8. In 1965, one-tenth of UK exports went to the US but one-quarter( 1,213 million) went to other countries which, we have assumed, would be members of the AFTA. In all these countries the UK now enjoys a tariffpreference on manufactured goods as compared with the US. In Norway, sweden and Denmark UK exports enter free of duty as a result of EFTA; with the irish republic the UK has begun to move from a preferential position towardscomplete free trade; and in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, where UKexports amounted to  607 million in 1965, about four-fifths still enjoy preferences(nearly two-fifths have a preference of more than 10 per cent). If all thesecountries were to join an AFTA, the UK would lose its present preferred positionover the US and would in consequence lose some trade to US exporters,particularly in the three Commonwealth countries. There might also be a switchin the source of UK imports of manufactured goods to the US from canada and the EFTA countries. On the other hand the UK would probably be obligedto increase imports of agricultural produce, particularly lamb, pigmeat and fruit and possibly cereals, as a result of concessions on access for agricultural products which would be demanded by the old Commonwealth and Denmark (see paragraphs 16 and 17). Thus the formation of an AFTA could be expected to havean adverse effect on the UK&apos;s overall balance of trade with members other thanthe US.Trade in industrial goods9. Production Departments were asked to examine, industry by industry,the possible results of free trade with the US in the light of existing tariff ratesand their knowledge of other factors, such as the cost of transport, the problemsof marketing across the width of the Atlantic^ differences of standards, taste and costs of production. The effect of the various factors influencing individual tradescould thus be assessed to see if they threw further light on the basic issue. Inmost cases Production Departments did not feel able to quantify their conclusions,although they were generally able to indicate the direction and nature of changes to be expected.10. The assessments suggested that there would be a movement in the UK&apos;s favour in the general field of consumer goods, where the present balance of tradeis already favourable (broadly in 1965 UK imports  75 million cif, UK exports 200 million fob, with whisky and motor cars by far the most important singleitems, each accounting for over  50 million). Items where the UK might expecta net gain include whisky, confectionery, pottery, woollen textiles, motor cycles,bicycles and motor cars. For many of these products the UK has a cost advantagebecause they are labour intensive but in the short run, at least, it might prove impossible to achieve major increases in exports: at present the UK tends tosupply the higher qualities of most of these goods, where relatively small changesin retail prices do not have much effect on sales, and it might in some cases provedifficult to increase supply to the US because of lack of productive capacity. Nolarge increase would be expected in sales of medium and lower quality goods,for which the price elasticity is greater, because of the relative efficiency of USfirms, high cost of transport, differences of consumer taste, etc. Here again, inthe short run, there would be shortage of capacity if a really big area of demandwere tapped.11. In the capital goods field, a net movement in favour of the US wouldbe expected.    The present balance of trade in mechanical and electrical
engineering is heavily in favour of the US (UK imports  176 million cif, UKexports  73 million fob in 1965) as it is also in the smaller fields of electronic and scientific instruments. Existing tariff rates are not markedly disparate and are mostly moderate, and demand is relatively price-inelastic for many of the productsconcerned, but US industry has a marked advantage in technology and scale ofproduction which would be more likely to be brought to bear on the UK marketwhen manufacturers foresaw long-term free entry here. The US might gainsubstantially in electrical engineering, in electronic equipment, includingcomputers, where US industry gets major side-benefits from defence research work, and in many major mechanical engineering products. The UK mightsecure a net advantage in some important mechanical engineering products butthis would offset only part of the general loss.12. The balance of trade in chemicals is also heavily in favour of the US(UK imports  71 million cif, UK exports  18 million fob in 1965) and was assessedto move more in their favour. The US industry has a basic advantage in lowerraw material costs in major sectors, particularly in the organic field, and benefits from large-scale production and high research expenditures. While the UK would gain in sales of a number of products which are at present affected by high UStariffs and the American Selling Price method of valuation for duty, this would bemore than offset by increased sales here of large volume chemicals in the absenceof some low protective duty. In the metals field the UK would gain in iron andsteel products where the US industry has a somewhat higher cost structure but no great change is expected in non-ferrous metal products where much of the existingtrade is already free of tariffs.13. It is difficult to judge whether the net gains in trade which could beexpected in the case of many consumer goods, some capital goods and certain other products would be greater or smaller than the losses in other sectors. Thevarious assessments suggested, however, that there would be a comparatively smallchange in the balance of trade with the US in the short term, and that possibly tothe UK&apos;s disadvantage. Whether there would be a gain or loss would depend muchmore on the relative rates of growth of the two economies than on the change in tariffs. More clearly the study indicated that there were several important fields(e.g., some chemical and engineering products) in which competition on equal terms with the US in other countries in the AFTA might operate substantially to the uk&apos;s disadvantage.Coal and oil14. Although there are no significant tariffs on coal and oil between the us and the UK, this country imposes an embargo on all imports of US coal and theUS imposes a strict limit on imports of crude oil and products (with the exceptionof fuel oil). It is impossible to forecast how much US coal would be imported ifthe present embargo were removed. It might be much or little (depending partly on whether the UK fuel oil tax, which protects UK coal, were lifted), and mightvary from year to year. Under present policies (which are under review) largeimports of coal would probably do serious harm to our coal industry, and have serious implications for the distribution of industry and for regional policies.15. On the other hand, the UK would benefit if the US ceased to discriminatefor defence reasons in their oil import policy. There would, in theory, be thepossibility of products refined in the UK from the cheaper Eastern Hemispherecrude oils being exported to the US with direct benefit to the UK balance ofpayments. If in fact the US market were opened in this way, the US wouldprobably then elect to take more Eastern Hemisphere crude oil direct, but the uk would still benefit, although to a lesser extent, from the profits on sales byUK companies of crude oil from their large reserves in third countries. In practice it is unlikely that any US Government would allow American self-sufficiency inenergy resources to be eroded further by Eastern Hemisphere oil. In thesecircumstances, if it seemed likely that a relaxation would result in large importsof US coal and possible serious damage to the UK coal industry, the UK would no doubt maintain its own embargo on US coal. The best judgment therefore isprobably that, taking coal and oil together, an AFTA would make little practicaldifference to the UK trade balance.
Agriculture16. As nearly all the other members would be large net exporters ofagricultural products, we have assumed that there would have to be some&quot; agricultural content&quot; in an AFTA. There would be strong pressure in that direction from the agricultural lobby in the US. Australia and New Zealand wouldprobably not be willing to dismantle their tariffs on imports of industrial goodsunless they were guaranteed greater opportunities to sell their exports of dairy products, meat and fruit on the UK and US markets. Canada would also be concerned to increase her food exports, particularly cereals, to the UK. Denmarkcould be expected to seek greater opportunities in both markets for her agriculturalexports. The UK would therefore come under pressure to increase its food imports, which are at present restrained by the agricultural support system ratherthan by tariffs (except as regards horticulture and fish). The US might possibly be persuaded to open its markets to a greater extent for dairy produce and beef,but the UK would be likely to find itself with less freedom to expand or evenmaintain its home food production under its present system of support.17. The UK could therefore expect some loss to the balance of payments onaccount of meat, dairy products and fish. But whether the impact of the&quot; agricultural content &quot; of an AFTA was large or small would depend much more on cereals. If the outcome of the Kennedy Round were an international agreement which gave the major cereals exporters substantially what they wanted, the US,Canada and Australia might not seek further concessions as the price of entry tothe AFTA. If, however, the Kennedy Round did not produce any cerealsagreement, or there were a compromise agreement less satisfactory to the exporters,it is very probable that the US, Canada and Australia would demand both firmerguarantees of access and possibly higher price arrangements with the UK. this could be an expensive addition to the UK&apos;s import bill.
ANNEX IIATTITUDES TOWARDS AN AFTA OF THE UNITED STATES, CANADAAUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND AND THE IRISH REPUBLICNote by the Foreign Office and the Commonwealth office a.  United StatesPrivate US attitudesAt present, enthusiasm for AFTA is confined to non-official organisations or individuals in the US. In August 1965 Senator Javits introduced into the USSenate proposals for a free trade association of Atlantic nations. Speaking inLondon in November of that year, he restated his proposal &quot; for a treaty of free trade and economic co-operation with the United Kingdom, other e.c. and EFTAnations, Canada, New Zealand and Australia and other industrialised countries ofthe OECD which agree to adhere to the new rules of trade of the free trade area &quot;.Senator Javits&apos; proposals have not emerged from the Senate Finance Committeeto which they were referred. He himself has not actively pursued his ideas.Nevertheless, they are said to have attracted interest in certain academic circlesin the US, specifically from Professor Galbraith at Harvard and ProfessorsGardner and Kennan at Columbia University.2. The Canadian-American Committee, an association of leadingindustrialists, bankers and trade unionists in the US and Canada recommended inMay 1966 that their Governments should initiate discussions with the UK andEFTA Governments of &quot; a broad free trade association of developed nations &quot;.In the opinion of the Committee&apos;s Director of Research, Mr. Sperry Lea, theCommittee&apos;s proposals are unlikely to be carried further until there is some positiveexpression of UK interest: but more recently a Committee has been formed ofprivate individuals in the US (including Professor Franck, Senator Javits and professor Galbraith) the UK (including Sir Roy Harrod and Mr. Maxwell Stamp)and Canada to draft &quot; a white paper, analysing various aspects of a proposed free trade area of Britain, Canada and the US, as well as several other nations &quot;. Itapparently intends to complete and probably publish this study in May or June.3. In a letter to The Times on 21 February a number of US State Governors,members of Congress and heads of universities proposed that the US and UKGovernments &quot; should now begin to consider contingent means, including mutuallybeneficial trade and fiscal reforms, for saving and strengthening the historicrelationship between our nations, whatever the outcome of the e.c. negotiations &quot;.This proposal is not for the circumstances assumed in this paper: it did not suggest any institutional arrangements and is apparently intended to be fully compatible with UK membership of the e.c.. Moreover, HM Embassy in Washington advise that the importance of the letter to The Times, which was very much a result of a personal initiative by Professor Franck, should not be overrated. They have been told that even Senator Javits was in some doubt as to whether he ought to signand, while the letter contained several distinguished signatures, there were just as many equally distinguished names of people closely interested in European affairs and sympathetic to Britain which were missing.4. Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington reports that the general public inthe US is, broadly speaking, uninformed and/or disinterested in a concept suchas AFTA. On the other hand there are elements, especially in areas or strata whichare traditionally Anglophile and pro-Anglo-Saxon, who instinctively feel that UKentry into Europe would be a disadvantage to the US without knowing preciselywhy. This is particularly true among the banking and financial community whoset considerable store by close co-operation between the pound sterling and theUS dollar and would be perturbed if London were to become influenced by currentFrench thinking about gold, etc. There are signs that this latest feeling is becoming a little more articulate and this movement may well continue, especially ifintransigence by the US in the Kennedy Round gives the US cause for complaint.
28CONFIDENTIAL-GUARDViews of the US Administration5. There is evidently no great enthusiasm for an AFTA within the USAdministration. US policy towards Europe was set out by President Johnson on 7th October, 1966:&quot;We look forward to the expansion and the further strengthening ofthe European Community. Of course, we realise that the obstacles are great.But perseverance has already reaped larger rewards than many of us daredhope for only a few years ago. The outlines of a new Europe are clearlydiscernible. It is a stronger, it is an increasingly united but open Europe with Great Britain a part of it-and with close ties to America.&quot;6. Evidence of views within the Administration reinforces the Presidentssupport for perseverance. Both the US Embassy in London and the state department have recently emphasised in confidential discussions the firmness of theAdministration^ refusal to contemplate a transatlantic arrangement between the uk, the US and Canada. They have said that the US saw no alternative policy for the UK in the foreseeable future which would be even remotely as favourable to US interests as the policy of the UK playing a full and responsible role in developing a more stable and cohesive Europe, that could join the US in meetingworld responsibilities. A member of the White House staff warned the Minister ofState for Foreign Affairs in January against attaching undue weight to what some people in the US might have said about US support for possible alternatives toUK membership of the e.c., e.g., an AFTA. He said that, at the centre, the view was still that it was overwhelmingly in the interests of the US that the UK should join the Community; any alternative tie-up between the US and the UK wouldnot make sense in terms of US political or economic interests and could only bedisruptive and a nuisance in terms of domestic affairs. In his view, this would apply, not only in the short term, but also in respect of long-term interests over thenext few decades.7. In general Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington has reported that,with the possible exception of Mr. Fowler and some of his colleagues in the USTreasury, the Administration is quite unwilling at present to be deflected fromthe view that if the UK is not successful in joining the e.c. now, the rebuff shouldnot be accepted as final and the option should be kept open until the time comesfor renewing the UK application.8. The State Department have also given us their confidential assessment of further possible US reactions to the publication of the AFTA study described in paragraph 2 above. They think that the study could attract quite a lot of attention in the US. Among non-officials it would be likely to interest some ofthe &quot; elder statesmen &quot; among the Atlanticists, e.g., Mr. Randolph Burgess andMr. led Achilles and possibly such people as Mr. Connor, the former Secretary ofCommerce. Within the Administration, the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Fowler,is known to be personally well disposed. In Congress, there is likely to be a small but active group of sympathisers, including the vocal Congressmen Reuss andOttinger. The former is known as a vigorous opponent of current French policyin relation to gold. The latter, a New York Democrat, and a junior member ofthe House, spoke up strongly in favour of a possible AFTA at the recent Ditchleymeeting.9. In fact, the State Department foresee the possibility of a definiteCongressional lobby emerging to some extent under the stimulus of the wave of anti-Gaullist sentiment. The State Department still think however that there willbe more smoke than fire since in their judgment only a small minority of theproponents of an AFTA in Congress really understand what is involved. When it came to the point, their enthusiasm would subside in face of the political difficulties.Among these would be the traditional unwillingness of the US to enter into tradingarrangements involving discrimination against some of their major trading partners;the political difficulty of omitting Japan from an AFTA and the economic problems which would be involved in her inclusion; the implications for US relations withLatin America of opening the US market to other advanced countries; and the dangerous implications of the international political and defence realignments thatwould follow the creation of an AFTA.
B.  Commonwealth countriesCanada10. In 1957, following a speech by Mr. Diefenbaker, then Prime Minister,stating that his objective was to divert 15 per cent of Canadian purchases from theUS to the UK, the UK Government proposed the creation of a free trade area between the UK and Canada. This proposal was not pursued by the canadian government, who were clearly embarrassed by it.11. There has recently been some public discussion of an AFTA in Canada.In October 1966 the Convention of the governing Liberal Party adopted a resolution to the effect that Canada should institute negotiations leading to the formation ofa North American and Caribbean Free Trade Area. No mention was made of countries outside the Western Hemisphere. Support for this resolution came largely from British Columbia and the Prairie Provinces where the resource-based industries(e.g., pulp, paper and aluminium), in which Canada has a comparative advantage,are mainly situated. Delegates from Ontario and Quebec, where there are alsosecondary manufacturing industries, were notably less enthusiastic.12. The Canadian Government are genuinely attached to the multilateralapproach to trade questions. Canadian Ministers have given little encouragement to the idea of Canadian participation in a regional trading group. In a speech on30 October, 1966, the Canadian Prime Minister said:&quot; Canada could not seriously contemplate a free trade union with theUnited States and the Caribbean countries unless the Canadian economy were strong enough and Canadian ownership and control of all our sources of prosperity complete enough to ensure that we would not lose our political independence.&quot;13. The Canadian-United States Automotive Agreement, concluded in 1965,provided for shared production of automobiles and parts between the two countries.This has been described as &quot; free trade &quot; although it falls short of that. Therehave been suggestions in Canada that similar arrangements should be made for other products.14. Canada has for decades had a yearly trade deficit with the US whichhas been covered in part by a trade surplus with the UK and, for the rest, by UScapital investment which has resulted in the domination of Canadian manufacturing industry by the US. The Canadian dilemma is to increase exports to the USwhile resisting the further penetration of Canadian industry by US interests. Inan AFTA Canadian resource-based industries, which are highly efficient, would benefit from the dismantling of US tariffs : the secondary industries mainly situated in Eastern Canada would probably suffer from the full force, of US competition,and from the removal of incentives to US industry to establish production in Canada.15. An AFTA would enable Canada to retain preferences in the UK againstexports from non-AFTA countries, but they would have^to be shared with the US.16. Through membership of NATO, Canada has close defence relations with both the US and the UK, who are also her main trading partners. An AFTAwould therefore be a logical development of Canada&apos;s existing international ties.17. On the other hand, the greater integration of the Canadian and USeconomies and the possible increase in US control of Canadian industry would raise difficult political problems. There would also be opposition from Quebec,where the French-speaking Canadians would fear closer association with the us and the Anglophone world.18. While the Canadians might take the view that the economic and political disadvantages of membership of an AFTA outweighed the advantages, it wouldbe difficult for them not to join in the last resort since the other assumed member countries take two-thirds of Canada&apos;s exports. They might be more attracted tothe idea if it were presented as a stepping stone to wider multilateral arrangements.Australia and New Zealand19. There is no marked public interest in Australia and New Zealand inmembership of an economic grouping wider than the limited free trade area between the two countries which came into being at the beginning of 1966. While
30CON FIDENTIAL GUARDUS trading and investment links with these countries are growing steadily, theyhave not reached the point at which US economic domination is an active politicalissue.20. The attitude of Australia and New Zealand towards membership of anAFTA would depend on the terms which they were offered. Both countries (butNew Zealand particularly) rely on temperate agricultural products for the bulkof their export earnings. (The other prospective members of an AFTA take40 per cent of Australia^ exports and 70 per cent of New Zealand&apos;s.) At thesame time, they are seeking to diversify their economies by setting up and developing manufacturing industries behind.a high protective tariff in Australiaand import quotas in New Zealand. They would therefore be interested in anAFTA only if other members were prepared to offer better opportunities for australian and New Zealand agricultural exports in terms of price and / or accessin return for some reduction in Australian and New Zealand tariffs. But it is unlikely that they would be prepared to forgo their protectionist policiescompletely.21. Australia would be concerned about her loss of preference in the UKmarket for processed foodstuffs in which her principal competitor is the US.22. Provided, however, that the economic cost were not too high, the naturalinclination of Australia and New Zealand would be to join a group which includedboth the US and the UK. This would be consistent with existing trading patternsand would correspond with political realities membership of ANZUS (whichreflects Australian and New Zealand dependence on the US in defence matters)and their position, with Canada, as &quot; old &quot; Commonwealth countries and part ofthe English-speaking world. Provided that protectionist policies could be retained,both countries would probably want Japan to be a member because of their rapidlydeveloping trade relations with her and the current trend of their foreign policies to concentrate on the Pacific and South-East Asian areas.Irish Republic23. The economy of the Irish Republic is so heavily dependent on agricultural exports to the UK that, if the UK joined an AFTA and it had an agricultural content, the Republic would have little choice but to follow. there seems no reason why this should be politically difficult for the Republic.Foreign Office, S.W.1,Commonwealth Office, S.W.1,15 March, 1967.
