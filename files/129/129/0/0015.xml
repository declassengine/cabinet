US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67) 65 COPY Na      Go26th April, 1967CABINETFACTUAL QUESTIONS BY ministers note by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister, I circulate the attachedanswers prepared by officials to factual questions by Ministers inaccordance with the procedure agreed at the Cabinet meeting on13th April, 1967 (CC(67) 20th Conclusions, Minute 3).(Signed)    BURKE trend cabinet Office, S.W.1.26th April, 1967
FACTUAL QUESTIONS BY MINISTERSF^esident of the Board of TradeQ.    Effect on retail prices of individual foodstuffsThe President has asked for a full list of the actual rises in retail prices of individual foodstuffs in the United Kingdom likely tofollow one adoption of the common agricultural policy.A.     It is not possible to give precise estimates of changes in the levels of retail prices for various foodstuffs here if the United Kingdom wereto accept the common agricultural policy as it stands.The reasons are:-(i)    there are no &quot;common retail prices&quot; for the e.c..   Theirprice aims (where formulated for certain commodities)relate to the wholesale stage, i.e. at the ports orwholesale markets;(ii)    in making our general assessment of a 10 per cent to14 per cent increase in the cost of food at the retaillevel, we estimated the effect at the wholesale stage and then allowed for a substantial range in processors&apos;,distributors and retailers&apos; mark-up;(iii)    except for a few relatively uniform commodities, e.g.butter and eggs, even at the wholesale level., the generalprice levels quoted In the e.c. eountries relate tostandards and qualities of products which are notnecessarily the same as those generally marketed in thiscountry.Gdven these limitations, all that can be done is to provide estimates of the ranges of possible retail price levels for the most importantfood items, broadly comparable to the range of price increases for foodgenerally of 1 0 per cent to 14 per cent.   In making calculations it has been necessary to take current   retail prices in the United Kingdom andto assume the full effect of accepting the common agricultural policy on these price levels as if it had come into force today.   The calculationsare attached at Annex A.
Q.Statistical work  the President would like to be informed of the progress of anystatistical work (including details and methods) on e.c. problems undertaken by Departments.A.     It is understood that, in asking this question, the President hadstatistical work had been undertaken on the balance of payments effect onentry into Europe;    and secondly he wanted to see the answers to any questions of a statistical character raised by Ministers in the presentcontext.     The report on the effect of entry into the e.c. on United kingdom balance of payments circulated to the Cabinet under cover of a note bythe Secretary of the Cabinet (c(67) 61) answers the first part of thePresident&apos;s question.     As far as the second part is concerned, theansvv-ers to the questions put by other Ministers are contained in this paper.Lastly, while the Central Statistical Office have maintained regularcontacts on publicly avualabltx statistics and statistical techniques^ withthe statisticians in the Commission In Brussels, they have not been askedto undertake any work directed specificially towards the implications ofUnited Kingdom entry into the Community.Minister of Agriculture,^Msher^ie^s^and^EqodQ.     Possibility of imitigatAn^^fTec^ts  f^higher jPpjldjrijsesThe Exchequer saving on agriculture has been estimated at possibly asmuch as  1 55 million, depending on the future of production grants.     Isit possible to make any assessment of the net total Exchequer result of joining the e.c., e.g. taking in such things as tariff revenue, Communitytaxation measures and all the other relevant factors?AY &apos;:: The various elements relevant to the Exchequer impact of membership of the e.c. are discussed in the Annex B.     While there would be savings inrespect of agricultural support, there would probably be a net loss of&apos;tariff revenue overall and expenditure, some of it additional, on oursubscriptions to the e.c. and EUEATOM Budgets and to the ECSC, the EuropeanDevelopment Eund, the European Investment Bank, and the European Social Eund.A major factor in the total Exchequer picture vrould be the effects of ourdiscontinuing purchase tax and adopting the e.c. system of value-added tax.This is an area of the greatest uncertainty.     Although the Six have now agreed on the system to be introduced by member countries by 1st January,1970, they have not yet agreed on whether, or when, the rates of tax shouldbe harmonised and at what level, nor on the question of coverage.It is impossible to quantify what these various elements would cost theExchequer.     Nor can we say what the yield of the value-added tax would be without knowing the rates and the coverage.     To make any estimates wouldinvolve assumptions about the conditions of membership which we shall be two interests in mind.Firstly he wished to know whether any departmental
able to negotiate and about the course of trade and of prices in the period after we had become members.     This would involve a double tier ofspeculative estimates, the one based on the other.     Moreover, for a comprehensive survey, we should have to extend the inquiry into fields whereEEC policy has not yet been settled, notably in respect of value-added tax;On the other hand, an inquiry into the Exchequer impact which was notcomprehensive could only be misleading.The only answer which can be given to the Minister&apos;s question at thisstage, therefore, is to identify the various elements which can be distinguished within the total Exchequer picture.     This is done in the annex.     While some of the constituent elements can be quantified, if only very approximately, some of the most important cannot be measured, partly because this depends on the course of any membership negotiations and partly because the relevant decisions have not yet been taken by the Six themselves.Moreover, some of the Exchequer effects &quot;would be felt at once and othersonly over a period of years.     Our conclusion, therefore, is that,particularly because of the overwhelming uncertainty in the taxation field,no overall estimate is possible.Q*     EfjFects on Commonwealth inmplgrantsIs it a fact that accession to the Community will not involve any alteration in Her Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s present policy of granting UnitedKingdom nationality, as of right, to immigrants from the Commonwealth whoapply after five years&apos; residence in the United Kingdom?A.     Accession to e.c. will not require any alteration in our policy, as EECbasic regulations stand at present;    and, for our own part, we have noreason to propose any alteration in that policy as a consequence of entry into e.c..     No one can say whether the e.c. would wish to call our present arrangements in question if we it ere to join,Q*     Total^of^alance^of payments costAllowing for the speculation necessary,  can we be told what the extremerange of total balance of payments cost might be;    and whether, even at the lowest end, it is consistent in the short term with the recovery and strengthening of the economy?A,; \- This question is answered by the report on the effect of entry intothe e.c. on United Kingdom balance of payments circulated to the Cabinetunder cover of a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (c(67) 61).-3-
Seoretary of State for- Education and Sciereeq ,    The Community St pjraj^tic methods of working in the discussions the Prime Minister am the Foreign Secretary hadin the capitals of the Six they gained the impression that the Communityhas operated In practice in a considerably more pragmatic and empiricalfashion than the Treaty of Rome would suggest.     Can any factual examples&quot;be given of how such pragmatism has operated in fields which would belikely to be of particular interest to the United Kingdom?A.     In their efforts to establish a Community, the existing Six member countries of the ESC have, from the start, adopted a pragmatic approach.First, there was the pilot project of the European Coal and Steel Community.The greater degree of responsibility given (at least in theory) to &quot;thecentral institutions under the ECSC Treaty was regarded as inappropriate for a Conounity covering the economies of member countries as a whole.In consequence, when the Treaties establishing the ESC and Euratom werenegotiated, more power was kept in the hands of the Ministerial Council(the body on which member Governments are represented.)     The present proposal to amalgamate the three Community executives, and perhaps later to amalgamate the three Treaties, is a further example of the Communitys*readiness to change with changing needs.In the negotiation of the Treaties, it proved necessary to add anumber of special provisions making exceptions in favour of one or moremember countries.     In the drawing up of the large number of regulations and directives so far agreed between the Six, the same overall principleshave applied.     It has not been in the interest of the Community as a whole to override the special interests of any member country:   neither beforenor after the crisis in the Community in 1965-66 has a majority vote ever been taken against important interests of any member state.     Agreement hasbeen reached unanimously, and the necessary concessions have been made to look after the interests of all member countries, either in the regulations or by derogation from them.     Further, when arrangements have shown them-selves to be inadequate in practice, they have been changed.     Finallythere are a number of cases where (sometimes all) member countries havebeen, or are, in breach of the Treaty and regulations, and where this hasbeen tacitly accepted in the general interest.A list of &quot;die derogations and exceptions so far agreed or admittedin the development of the Community would occupy a very considerable bodyof pap*re      By way of illustration, detailed notes on about seventy suchderogations and exceptions, some fifty of them in the field of agriculture,are attached at Annex C.-4-
For example Juty^quojbas have been, and continue to be, granted to member states to enable then to import items, usually those whereCommunity production falls short of consumption, at rates of duty belowthe common external tariff.     In addition, a provision allowing a member state to postpone the adoption of the common external tariff ir. certaincircumstances on up to 5 per cent of the value of its total imports from third countries has been used.Escape clauses in the directives on capital movcaonts have enabled the French, and other member states, to avoid dismantling their existingexchange control rogines.     In ihis field, some Community countries have drawn our attention to the provisions in the Treaty which would allowmeasures to be taken to avoid difficulties arising from differing degrees of free movement of capital in different member states.     In the field ofregiojial jieyelopment, Belgium has recently provided for state aid to anumber of regions where there is no economic but only politicaljustification;   and the Commission, and -the Community, have accepted this.In the field of taxation, although the principle of a coition system ofadded value tax has been accepted, a wide range of exceptions will beallowed in its application.Since two thirds or more of the Community&apos;s work has been inagriculture, it is natural that exceptions and derogations should be mostwidespread in the agricultural field.     Examples are -(a) a deficiency payments system for vegetable oils;(b) the payment of consumer subsidies on a national basis;(c) the radical change in the Community&apos;s original arrangements forfruit and vegetables, to meet Italian interests;the duty free import of live cattle Into Italy, without limit;(a(e(f(Sthe granting of a higher proportion of expenditure on structuralprojects from Community funds for Italy.the payment of disguised subsidies to milk producers in Germany;a number of cases in which transitional subsidies or compensation have been paid to farmers in individual member countries.A number of these exceptions and derogations, however, affect commoditiesfor which a single market has not yet been established:   and some aretemporary or taper&quot; off.-5-
-6-By definition these derogations and exceptions have been designedto meet the interests of existing member countries.   For countriesseeking membership, two conclusions can be drawn -(i)   once a country joins the Community, its interests become theinterests of the Community as a whole, in the sense that itis not to the advantage of the Community as a whole that any-one of its members should suffer unreasonably by theoperation of the Community or should feel that it is sosuffering.   The development of the Community depends on thesuccessful and willing cooperation of all its members; andthe development of the Community has become a major national interest for all who are inside it, even for Prance.   assign or Fanfani put it to the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary during their visit to Rome in January, whereaswounds (he had Italy&apos;s experience in mind) might be inflictedby the Common Agricultural Policy, there was a salvo to bofound for them;(ii)   because the safeguarding of individual national interests hasbeen achieved by adopting, or making exception to, the initialrules on an ad hoc basis, the existing members of the Communityfind it difficult to sympathise with the view that everythingshould be defined clearly and permanently in advance.   Timeand again, the Pome Treaty states a general principle in this or that field of operation, only to provide for numerousexceptions and derogations to the general principle.   It Isin this way that, without the signatories of the Treaty havingbeen able to foresee problems years in advance, the Communityhas been able to develop up to now, empirically and untidilybut nevertheless successfully from the point of view of its members.

If so, then prices may rise to only a snailextent whereas if price levels are determined largely by the C.A.P. milk productsregulation then prices could rise substantially.
ANNEX BTEE EFFECT ON THE EXCHEQUER OE UNITED KING-DOM MEMBERSHIP OE THE EECThe main fields In which there would he effects on the Exchequerare -The change to the Community system of agricultural support would bring savings to the Exchequer.   If the cost of present exchequer support to agriculture is taken a.s  240 million per annum, and 20 million is added for the amount of levy receipts that we should probably be allowed to retain, the gross benefit to the Exchequer wouldbe  260 million por annum.     From this must be deducted the cost ofthe production grants that we coirld expect to retain ( 4-0 million)and the amount of eur assumed contribution to the Agricultural Fund( 65 million).     This means a net saving of the order of  155 million at the end of the transitional period.   The two main uncertainties inthis calculation are production grants and the amount of our contributions to the Agricultural Fund.   As regards the latter we may hope to be able to negotiate some mitigation in our favour.   We may also hope to obtain Community finance for some of our production grantsout of the Guarantee Fund.Tariff RevenueReceipts from protective duties at present charged on imports fromCommunity countries, are probably of the order of  70 million a year.This figure would, however, be only ene element in a calculation of therevenue effect of tariff changes if we joined the e.c.   These changes would include not only the eventual abolition of tariffs on imports fromEEC countries, but also the introduction of the Common External tariff on imports from non-e.c. countries at present duty-free,     Account would need to be taken of the effect of the Kennedy Round both on our own tariffand on that of the e.c..     Also the pattern of imports might be markedlydifferent after we joined the Community from the present pattern andwould depend on many factors, including the nature of demand and the overall level of economic activity in this country.agricultural support; -tariff revenue;changes in tax revenue;subscriptions to Community organisations.These are further considered separately belowCD
Some of those factors would lead to losses of tariff revenue and some to gains, and with so many imponderables it is impossibleto make a meaningful calculation of the overall effect.Changes in tax revenueThis is a vitally important field, but there are very greatuncertainties.   The Community has made little progress towardsharmonising direct taxation, but in the field of indirect taxationthe e.c. Council has recently adopted two Directives to establish a harmonised Community system of value added tax.   Member states are under an obligation to introduce this system by 1st January 1970*Although the ultimate aim of the Six is to harmonise tax rates and to abolish fiscal frontiers between themselves, that stage has not yetbeen reached and it is only the system of taxation on which theyhave agreed.The question of an added value turnover tax has been under studyin Whitehall for some months, but it is impossible to anticipatewhat decisions United Kingdom Ministers may eventually take on thismatter.   A change to the Community&apos;s system would have far-reachingeffects wn tax revenue and taxation policy.Subscriptions to Community organisations(a) The e.c. and EURATOM BudgetsMembers States are required by the Treaty to contribute to the running expenses of the e.c. Commission and the EURATOM Commission(the ECSC is financed by.direct income).    Total e.c. and EURATOMrunning expenses In 19^7 were estimated at ^79 million, but if theUnited Kingdom were a member It is to be assumed that the existing staff would be expanded and hence that we would need to contribute our share of a somewhat larger total figure.   This might work out atsomething like  7 million per annum.(b) EURATOM (research and development&apos;)The main objective of EURATOM is to encourage the development of peaceful applications of nuclear energy by co-ordinating the activitiesof its members.    In 1962 it was estimated that Our contribution to research and development might amount to between  9 million and  11 million and there is no reason to believe that it v/ould now be greater.   Ways and means of providing part of this contribution in kind might be possible by making available to our EURATOM partners the facilities of some ofour research establishments in the United Kingdom.(2)
(o)   The European Coal and Steel community the aims of the ECSC are to promote industrial expansion &quot;bycreating a common market in coal and steel.   On accession to it wewould become liable for a contribution to the High Authority levy;on the basis that this was at the present rate of 0.25 per cent ofthe average value of products subject to the Treaty this would amount to  4.million to  5 million.   But the Treaty empowers theHigh Authority to impose a levy of up to 1 per cent and there isat present a proposal under consideration to raise the rate from.25 per cent to 0.30 per cent or even 0.35 per cent.   This would increase the size of the United Kingdom contribution accordingly.We might also have to pay an &quot;entrance fee&quot; of anything between 5 million -and  30 million foi- the right to share in existing ECSCfunds built up in the past from the annual levy.   We might- also haveto accede to proposals for a Coking Coal Compensation Eund, the setting up of ydiich is being studied.     This might involve an additional contribution of about  1.5 million per annum.(d)   The European Development EundThe Treaty of Rame provided for the creation of a DevelopmentEund for the benefit of the EECTs associated overseas territories.Total subscriptions and allocations for the first five years of theFund (1958 to 1962 inclusive) amounted each to ^581 million.   Of thelatter, ^511 million (88 per cent) was allocated to former french colonial territories.   In July I963 the Six and the A0Tls signed aConvention of Association which provided for a total of $730 million to be disbursed by the Development Fund to the A0T!s during a secondfive year period, up to the end of I967. &quot;&apos; Of the subscriptions to this$730 million, France and Germany each subscribed ^21^6^ million.The European Development Fund constitutes an element in theYaounde Convention which governs relations between the Community andits African associates.   The Convention is due to expire in 19^9 butit will presumably be replaced by comparable arrangements including a fund for providing development aid.   If we joined the Community it seemshighly likely that we should have to accede to the Yaounde convention or its successor since this is virtually an Integral part of the Treatyof Rome.   It is impossible at this stage to estimate what eur financial(3)
commitment would be.&apos;  This would depend on the size of the fund inthe post-1969 period, including the number and economic position ofthe new Commonwealth associates.   It would also be affected by thecontributions of any other developed new members.   A new &quot;key&quot; wouldhave to be worked out to determine the percentage contribution ofeach member&quot; of the enlarged Community and a new allocation to theassociates agreed.   Our -aims would be to ensure that our contributiondid not exceed the total sum which Commonwealth associates receivedfrom the Fund and- to try to reach agreement, insofar as this might appear negotiable, that part of the contribution of the existing andthe new members of the Community (other than Britain) was applied for the benefit of the new associates.   Subject to the outcome of negotiation our total aid programme would probably have to be increasedto take account of our contribution to the European Development Fund.(e)   The European Investment BanlcThe Bank was set up when the Treaty of Rome entered into forceand its intended function is to facilitate economic expansion of theCommunity,     The Statute of the Bank lays down that this task shouldbe achieved by financing projects in the following fields -(a) the development of under-developed regions of the Community;(b) modernisation or conversion of enterprises or creation ofnew activities called for by the progressive establishmentof the Common Market;(0)   projects of common interest to several Member countries.The Bank has made a large number of loans to private and publicenterprises in Member States and has also provided some credits forassociated overseas territories.Participation in the Bank is limited to e.c. Member countries, andnew full Members of the e.c. must also become members of the Bank.   Thesubscribed capital of the Bank is 1,000 million Units of account(sdollars).     France and Germany have each to subscribe 300 million units,Italy 240 million units and Benelux countries the remainder.   When anew member joins the Bank Its subscription must be additional to theexisting total of 1,000 million units of account.     Only one-quarter of thetotal (i.e. 250 million units of account or  90 million) has so far beenU)
paid up.The unpaid balance oan be called for in case of need,but the Bank is expected to obtain the major part of its resources on international capital markets by issuing loans, mainly in theform of bonds.   Nearly all of the issues made by the Bank have been,raised in the six e.c. countries.   At the end of 19^5 the Bank had raised a total of 217 million units of account on the market.(f)   The European Social Eund- The purpose of this Fund, set up by the Treaty of Rome, is topromote employment opportunities in the Community, and the geographicaland occupational mobility of workers.   For this purpose-it is authorised to refund, on application from Member States, 50 per cent of expenditure on the occupational training and resettlement ofunemployed or under-employed workers, or on aid to workers whoseemployment is reduced or suspended while an enterprise is being converted from one line of production to another.   Proposals made in1965 to improve the effectiveness of the Fund are still underconsideration.   As members of the Community we should be required tocontribute to the Fund and would receive certain reimbursements from it.   The net United Kingdom contribution to the Fund at current rateshas, on a comparison with West Germany&apos;s experience, been estimated tobe about  250,000 per annum.(5)
ANNEX CArticles 12-29 - Customs Union1.     In the field of the Customs Union there are a large number ofcases where member states have legitimately, as a result of special provisions made by the Treaty, escaped the full rigour of the Treaty&apos;sbasic provisions.    (To the best of our knowledge there have not inthis sector been any outright breaches of the Treaty).2.     One example is under Article 17(4) which allows member states to retain a particular fiscal customs duty for up to 6 years afterthe coming into force of the Treaty where its replacement   by an internal charge would cause serious difficulty.3.     In Article 19(&quot;2) in the calculation of the GCT,  specific exceptionwas made to allow calculations to be based on the duties which wouldhave been applied had the Italians not temporarily reduced their dutiesby 10   per cent.4.     The prinoipal examples lie in the provisions of Article 25 whichlays down the rules for the granting of national tariff quotas of products on a number of lists annexed to the Treaty itself. Productson lists B, C,  and D can be the object of tariff quotas granted &quot;by theCouncil on a proposal of the Commission and those on lists E and &amp;and Annex II (agricultural products) can be the object of tariff quotasgranted at the direction of the Commission without the intervention ofthe Council.     The main purpose of these provisions has been to alleviate the problems of member states approximating towards theCemmon External Tariff and notably the problems of those member states(Germany and Benelux) moving up toy/ards the CET,    They are generallylimited to cases where Community production falls short of consumption and where supplies have traditionally come from outside the Community.Tariff quotas under Article 25 have been granted in large numbers on anannual basis since the entry into force of the Treaty;   the number of quotasgranted, though not always their size has, however steadily diminishedunder the constant pressure of the Commission to reduce these exceptions to the minimum.5.   In addition to the provisions for national tariff quotas, Article 26allows the Commission to authorise a member state to postpone raising orlowering its duties as provided for elsewhere in the Treaty, up to amaximum of 5 per cent of the value of its total imports from third countries.This provision has been used, although less frequently than that for tariffquotas;    it was most recently used to enable the Germans to avoidraising their tariff on a number of tariff positions where the 20 per centnotianal reduction on the Common External Tariff was no longer being maintained.
6.     Finally, the Council itself can unanimously modify or suspendduties in the Common External Tariff under Article 28.   This procedurehas heen used to regularise the prolongation of the 20 per centnotional reduction on the Common External Tariff, on those positionswhich are the object of a full offer in the Kennedy Round.   It hasalso been used to suspend tariffs on tea and tropical hardwoods.   Itis being Increasingly used by the Community in both bilateral andmultilateral trade negotiations to grant Community tariff quotas(as distinct from the national tariff quotas referred to inparagraph 4 above).Article 37 &quot; State Monopolies7.     In so far as the requirement &quot;to adjust any state tradingmonopolies, so as to ensure that.....no discrimination exists,.....&quot;does not need to have been completed until the end of the transitional period, member states are not at present In breach of the Treaty.But paragraph 1 of the Article did provide that the adjustment was tobe gradual and so far there has been little sign of any movement towardsthe elimination of discrimination.     The Commission has undertakenstudies of the various problems involved and has recently worked out some proposals for submission to member states concerned, but admitsthat these are but a step towards implementing the principlesenshrined in the Treaty, and do not provide final solutions.8.     It is very much open to question whether the wide range of statemonopolies (the Italian monopoly on tobacco, salt, cigarette papers,lighters and flints;    the French monopoly on tobacco, petroleum,potassium and explosivesf     the match monopolies in France, Italy and -ermany, to mention just some of them) will all be &quot;adjusted&quot; to conform with the Treaty by the end of the transitional period.   Someof the state monopolies are of course linked with other aspects of community policy - the French import regime for petrol with the Communityenergy policy, and the French and Italian tobacco monopolies with theorganisation of the tobacco market under the Common Agricultural Policy,9*     Articles 38-47 - AgricultureSee the Appendix to this Annex.
Articles 48-51 - Labour Mobilit;10.   Article 3(c) lists the abolition of obstacles to the free movementof persons, services and capital as one of the Community&apos;s main tasks.Article 48 provides that by no later than 1970 workers should have theright to accept offers of employment actually made and have freedomadministration is excluded).     Consultations between the Commissionand government experts have begun over the test of regulations tosupersede Regulation 38/64, currently in force and due to last until31st December 1967j but these are in their ea.rly stages.     the regulation in its present form abolished the priority of national labour markets, but member states have the power, under the transitional provisions for departing from the provisions of the Treaty to re-establish national priority for jobs or areas with a manpower surplusby granting priority for two weeks to national workers for fillingavailable posts.11.     The existing regulations have in practice caused no difficulty to any member state.   If they did, there are safeguards which could beapplied.     Germany, Italy and Luxembourg did not use this power in1966.   The Netherlands used It in the first quarter of the year only,in respect of musicians and artistes.    Belguim invoked the escapeclause in respect of mining employment in three provinces in the first three-quarters of the year, but not in the last.   France invoked the escape clause throughout the year in regard to certain engineeringoccupations, agricultural work and unskilled office work in respectof specified areas.   It seems likely that the escape clause will disappear in the revised Regulation that will be adopted.Article 55 - Right of Establishment12,   Under Article 55, activities involving any exercise of public authority are excluded from the right of establishment.   The council may decide that the right of establishment shall not apply to certainactivities.Articles 67-73 - Capital Movements13.   The Treaty lays very few specific obligations on the member states in this field.   The two directives on capital movements agreed by theCouncil in 1961 and I962 do involve certain obligations but their termshad taken Into account the control then operated by the French andother member states.of movement and residence for this purpose.(Employment in public3.
Articles 74-84 - Transport14.   The extremely slow progress which is being made in the establishmentof a common transport policy (as a result of the failure of the Councilto take decisions on a whole range of Commission proposals, one or twoof which date back to 1962) results in member states being able tocontinue to operate systems and pursue policies which are incompatible with the Treaty provisions without, however, being technically in breach.   In these circumstances, the ability of the Commission torequire a particular practice to be abandoned is very limited.   Theyhave, however, been able to act in a few cases *   One of them (stillhowever, the subject of dispute between the Commission and the federal german Government) concerns the special tariffs of the German Federalrailways to benefit the economy of the Saar,   The Commission doesnot share the German view that these are &quot;competitive tariffs&quot;permitted by Article 80(iii) and justified in the light of threatenedcompetition from the construction of a Saar-Rhine Palatinate Canal.Articles 92-*94 - State Aids...................&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&apos;&quot;&quot;&apos; (15.   The process by which the Commission under the terms of Article 93is required to examine all systems of aid and to take action in those cases in which they find the aid to be incompatible with the Treaty isa slow and laborious one which will be going on for a long time.   Inthe two years up to March 1966 the Commission pronounced on just over 80 cases but of course they examined a very much greater number.Although the few reports which one sees of member states being formallyrequested to abandon a particular form of aid (and in most casesreaching agreement with the Commission about doing so) clearly Indicatethat there are still many state aids whioh are incompatible with theprovisions of the Treaty, it is not possible to judge exactly to what extent this is so.   What does seem clear is that the Commission isprepared to stretch the provisions of the Treaty pretty far in orderto find cover for aids which one would have expected to be foundincompatible.16.     Article 92(3a) (economic development of particular regions)appears to be a useful escape clause.   Under a law of 14th July 1966,&quot;the Belgian Government extended the operation of an earlier law of 1959which provided for state aid to the development of coal mining distructsin Belgium and to &quot;certain other regions confronted with acute and urgent problems&quot;.   A main provision of the law was that firms setting4*
up in subsequently specified areas should be able to borrow money at 5 per cent below the market rate of interest;    other fiscaladvantages were also given.   The subsequent orders implementing thelaw provided for these advantages to aperate in 676 named communeswith a combined population of some 3i million i.e.  3 of the total population of Belgium.     For political reasons the Belgian Governmentincluded not only Walloon regions where there are genuine problems arising from declining Industries but, to balance them, a number ofFlemish speaking areas which cannot be regarded as other thaneconomically prosperous.17.     The Commission&apos;s initial reaction at official level was to reject the scheme as incompatible with the provisions of Article 92of the Treaty, but it capitulated in the face of the BelgianGovernment&apos;s insistence.   As a face saving device, the commission are requiring the Belgian Government to send bi-annual reports on thescheme&apos;s operation.     This failure of the Commission to implementits own criteria for assessing state and regional aids and their willingness, under political pressure, to allow a member governmentto drive a coach and horses through the provisions of the Treaty isclearly significant.18.   Soon after this the Commission approved a project involving theconstruction of a nylon and dacron spinning factory in Germany bythe American Company Du Pont at Unna in North Rhine-YJestphalia.   Therewas an element of subsidy in the case since because of the co-operationof the local government authority the Company was able to buy the land at a price lower than the normal market value.   The Commission were reported to take the   view that some &quot;compensation&quot; should be given xoa company which was prepared, as in this case, to establish itself in a region where there were significant economic disadvantages.   Anofficial of the Commission agreed that once the general prinoiple of&quot;compensation&quot; was accepted as a valid reason for the application ofArticle 92(3o) of the Treaty, then the doors would open very wide forthe admission of all sorts of aids and subsidies.5
19.     The Commission are presently considering a new Dutch measure which proposes to give certain substantial benefits to investmenton a regional basis, including investment finance at a subsidisedrate of interest and payment of half of the cost of the land needed to establish new factories:    the total effect would be to subsidise 35 per cent of the cost of the initial investment.   TheCommission&apos;s objective was reported to be to reduce the scale of thesubsidisation to something in the region of 25 per cent of the initial investment, but if, as seemed likely, the Dutch resisted itwas felt most unlikely that the Commission would take formal actionagainst the measure as they were entitled to do under Article 93.20.     In certain sectors - e.g. shipbuilding and the cinematographicindustry, Commission proposals have been put forward for aids to beharmonised rather than abolished.   But these latter proposals havenot yet been approved by the Council and in the meantime certain ofthe member countries are. - and are being allowed to remain - in breach.It is noteworthy that the Commission&apos;s harmonisation proposals forstate aids to shipbuilding have been linked to Article 235 (achievement of an objective of the Community for which the Treaty does not providethe necessa.ry powers of action) and would, if approved, provide fora ItO per cent subsidy until December 19^9 - longer than foreseen for ship building subsidies, in paragraph 3c of Article 92.21 .     In the elimination of export aids in so far as they relate tointra-Community trade some member states have asked for, and beengranted, periods of grace before abolishing illegal aids.22.     Under Article 93(2) Belgium and France have been requested to abolish their preferential rediscount rates and France and Italy to abolish their systems of insurance against risk of increased production costs.   Also, under Article 93(2), the Commission has now given formalnotice to Germany, Luxembourg and Holland in respect of aids given bythe processing of cerea.ls.23.   In the textiles field, the aids granted by various member states arebeing examined in a working group which may come up eventually withharmonisation proposals.   The Commission has yet to pronounce upon acurrent Frenoh system under which the proceeds of a tax on textiles sales(irrespective of their origin) is used for the exclusive benefit of theFrench textile industry (for research etc.).    Commission officials at desklevel have expressed a view that this will be found to be incompatible with the Treaty although some aid to textiles in another (harmonised)form would not be.
24.   A further example of state aid is as follows.   In November 1966,Agence Europe reported that the e.c. Commission had initiated theTreaty procedure, applicable in cases of state aids liable todistort competition, in respect of rebates given by the dutch government for the production of potato starch.Articles 108-109 &quot; Balance of Payments25.   Articles 108 and 109 provide for protective measures when aState is in balance of payment difficulties.Article 22626.   This Article permits a member state to seek authorisationfor special measures during the transitional period, designed torectify difficulties in any particular sector of economic activity.7.
