DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT)THE 1967 UPDATING OF SOCIAL SECURITY benefits memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in the context of measures to restrict public expenditure in1967-68 the Cabinet took the view on 17th November last (CC(66) 58thConclusions) that the next uprating of social security benefits shouldbe 10 s. Od. for a single per son&apos;s pension and should take effect at the^end of October, 1967.The Basis of the November Decision20       The Cabinet1 s decision was based on a forecast at the timeand not on actual figures.     The forecast was that real earnings wouldhave risen by about 6. 7 per cent and prices by 10 per cent between 1st April, 1965 and 1st November, 1967.    To match rises of this order fully, an uprating of 14s. Od. (rounded) would have beenneeded;  but in practice the amount v/ould have been held back to13s. Od. as a result of an earlier decision that the next upratingmust be held back by Is. Od, to help finance the supplementary benefitsscheme.     The decision of 17th November therefore meant that the nextuprating would be 4s. Od. below the level which it was thought wouldhave been needed to match the expected rise in real earnings and prices,and 2s. Od. above the expected increase in retail prices..The Present Position ,,3,       Since last November, however, the picture has changed.    As aresult of the success of our prices and incomes policies, we now expectearnings to have risen not by 6,7 per cent but by 5, 2 per cent, and pricesnot by 10 per cent but by 8. 6 per cent.     This means that it is not necessaryto increase the pension by as much as 10s. Od, in order to achieve thesame standard of living as we then intended.    On this revised basis the equivalent of the 10s. Od. uprating decided by the Cabinet last november would be about 8s.  3d.C(67) 69COPY NO.28th April, 1967CABINET
4.       The following table sets this out:-Nov. 1966 April 1967(rounded)Uprating in line with expectedearnings                                                       14s, 11s. 5d.Less Is.

As my colleagues will know, I am extremely concerned aboutthe level of public expenditure in 1968-69 which is likely to be an evenmore difficult problem than in 1967-68,    17e shall have to pay particular attention to this in the review of civil expenditure which we are under-taking this summer.    In the case of social security benefits, however,expenditure in 1968-69 will be virtually governed by the 1967 uprating.6.       A 10s, Od. uprating would mean extra gross expenditure of 230 million a year (about  40 million on the Exchequer),    For an8s, Od, (for technical reasons upi atings need to be at least in multiplesof 6d. and preferably of Is, Od.    An uprating of precisely 8s, 3d, would therefore not be possible) uprating the figure would be  170-180 million(almost  30 million on the Exchequer).     The difference is thereforeabout  50 million (over  10 million on the Exchequer) - a sum whichcould be very significant for other expenditure programmes.The Implications for Contribution7.       An uprating will mean an increase in contributions and I understandthat about ls,10d. a side would be needed to finance a 10s. Od. upratingand about Is, 6cl, a side to finance an uprating of 8sr Od,    I understandalso that because the numbers of retired, sick and unemployed arehigher than were forecast in 1965, it will be necessary to add perhaps4d, -8d. a side on top of what is needed to finance the next upratingas such.     The contribution aspects of the next uprating are, of course,important since the employees  contributions fall on the working population and serve to reduce any increase in real earnings theymay have had, and employers1 contributions lead to increases in industrial costs and generally in the cost of living.General8.       I attach a table giving details of all upratings since 1945.     Theincrease we gave in March, 1965 was the largest ever given.    It meant a very substantial rise in pensionersl living standards.    An 8s.. Od, rise
next October would not only restore the 1965 standard which was widelywelcomed but further improve it.    Moreover this increase would bemade at a time when there is a real prospect of greater stability inthe cost of living.    With an 8s, Od. increase we should have raisedpensions by 20s. 6d, in 2jr years as compared with 37s, 6d, in 13 yearsof Tory rule.conclusion,       I invite the Cabinet to agree, in the light of the latest forecast of the movement of earnings and prices, and of the prospects for public expenditure in 1968-69, that the uprating of social security benefits which is to take effect from the end of October, 1967, shouldbe for 8s. Od, (single person&apos;s pension), and thus to reaffirm inprinciple the decision reached on 17th November last year.10.      I am proposing 8s. Od, in deference to the Minister of social security!s view that for administrative reasons upratings should bein multiples of Is, Od. rather than of 6d,,    But my colleagues should know that I would be ready to accept 8s, 6d. and I do not believe thereare decisive technical reasons why this should not be done.    An Os, 6d.uprating would give pensioners Is. 7d. more than the rise in prices would justify and would more than match the Cabinet1 s decision of last november.L.
