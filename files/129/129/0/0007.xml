NOTE FOR MEMBERS OF THEHOUSE OF COMMONS SELECT COMMITTEE ON A&amp;RI CULTUREEffect of accepting Common Agricultural Policy onjrolune ofUnited Kingdom Cereals production.    At its meeting on 5th April the Select Committee examined theMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food witness about the likely effectof accepting the common agricultural policy, as it stands, on the volumeof United Kingdom cereals production.   The witness explained that an assessment had been made and that the increase would be considerable.   he pointed out, however, that to make public the details of the estimatecould involve disclosing underlying assumptions which could have undesirablerepercussions.   At the request of the Committee he agreed to consider the submission of a note on an entirely confidential basis for members of theCommittee, who had asked for the information.2.     Currently, United Kingdom cereals production amounts in total to some13.5 million tons and, whether or not this country were to enter theCommon Market, is expected to continue to increase for some years to meetincreased demand - chiefly for animal feed.   In Common Market conditions the increase in prices and in relative profitability of cereals would leadto a very large increase in production.   There are, however, certainlimiting factors which affect both acreage and yield.3.     Climate, soil and terrain impose physical limitations on the acreagethat could be used for cereals.   In addition, and despite the much increased relative profitability of cereals production, there vrould stillbe some competition for land from other farm products.   Beef and sugar beetwould also be more profitable than now;    and the dairy farmer would underthe European Economic Commission^ (e.c.) present regime have a strongincentive to concentrate on summer production from grass.   Moreover, wherecereals were grown extensively break crops would be needed to reduce soilexhaustion and disease risks.4.     Average yields over tho whole cereals acreage could not be expected tobe increased significantly above recent levels, despite continuingtechnological improvements, if less suitable land were used and continuouscultivation of cereals year after year increased disease risks.-1-secret annex A
5.     Taking account of these factors, we have estimated that if thecommon agricultural policy were applied in the United Kingdom as It stands,and if the Community&apos;s prices and price relativities remained unchanged,United Kingdom cereals production could be expected to reach in due course a level of some 20 million tons.6.     It must be emphasised that these figures are necessarily speculative.The increase in the prices and profitability of cereals in Common market conditions would be far greater than any yet experienced in the UnitedKingdom.   For this reason, supply elasticities, calculated on previousprice changes within a relatively narrow range, afford little guide tothe effects of changes of this magnitude.
General Assumptiops5.     To start any assessment certain basic assumptions are necessary -(i)   Membership of an enlarged Community.     The Committee has asked that figures should be given on the basis of a Communityconsisting only of the Six and the United Kingdom,(ii)   Prices.     It is assumed that the general level of existing world and Community prices remains unchanged.     As a consequence theestimate takes Into account the likely effects of e.c. prices on production and consumption in the United Kingdom, which togetherwould affect the volume of imports of leviable commodities and,therefore, the size of the levy hand-over to the Fund.ANNEX note &quot;FOR MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE 03? COMMONSSELECT COMMITTEE&quot; ON AGRICULTUREPossible effects of United Kingdom accession on financing of the e.c. ^ Common Agricultural policy.     At its meeting on 5th April the Select Committee examined the Ministryof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food witness about the assessment of UnitedKingdom contributions to and receipts from the eec&apos;s Agricultural guidance and Guarantee Fund, and on the likely financial effects of United Kingdomaccession on the cost to the existing members.     The discussion was on thehypothetical basis that the common agricultural policy and the system agreed for financing it should apply as they stood.2.     The witness explained that an assessment had been made, talcing intoaccount all the relevant factors which he enumerated, but that most if not all of these factors were to varying degrees by their very nature not capableof being precisely quantified.     It was abundantly clear, however, on thehypothetical basis propounded that the size of the United Kingdom contributionto the Fund, chiefly due to the hand-over of levy proceeds on imports, wouldbe disproportionate to the receipts the United Kingdom could expect to receive from the Fund and could be expected to reduce greatly the size of the nationalcontributions otherwise likely to be required from the existing members.     to publish in detail the break-down of the inevitably speculative nature of thefigures or range of figures given for the separate factors, and the under-lying assumptions on which they were based, could well be prejudicial to any negotiations.     At the request of the Committee he agreed to consider what might be made available to the Committee on these lines oj^ an entxjrol^yconfidential basis.     This note is provided on that basis,
(iii)   Levy and tariff arrangements.     It is assumed that these would apply unchanged by the Community for individual commodities, whichhas a bearing on tho proportions of our imports likely to comefrom Community and from third country (leviable) sourcesrespectively.(iv)   e.c. financial arrangements.     It is assumed that these are appliedunchanged to the United Kingdom.     No attempt is made to give anyweight to factors which could be significantly affected by the outcome of any negotiation for United Kingdom accession.Factors involved in the assessment4.     The two main elements in a calculation are obviously the changedrequirement of the Fund to cover United Kingdom accession, and the size ofthe contribution which the United Kingdom would be making to that Fund.There are several components to each of these elements, viz -A.     Changed requirement of the FundWe start with the recent estimates by the Commission of the annualrequirements of the Fund at the single market stage for the Six, i.e. 480 million for the Guarantee Section and the limit of  100 million which has been set for the Guidance Section.     Thus we have a totalworking requirement for the present Community of  580 million;   but itmust be remembered that this itself is a Commission estimate based on more or less speculative predictions of the level of SEC production andof future Community and world prices.     United.Kingdom accession wouldalter this requirement in three ways -(i)   the cost of export restitutions and of market intervention(support buying) for United Kingdom produce.     In attemptingan assessment we have considered the effects of e.c. price levels on United Kingdom production and the extent to whichintervention might be necessary to sustain internal market prices at the new levels, and to which export subsidies mightbe payable in respect of United Kingdom exports to third countries.     Much the greater part of this cost would be..... ,   attributable to cereals.To form a, judgment of the sums actually likely to be&apos;required involves predicting, however, not only the volume ofUnited Kingdom production and consumption but also produc-tion and consumption in the enlarged Community as a whole.This is because both the extent of intervention and the sumsactually payable for export subsidies must vary both with the
degree of self-sufficiency in the enlarged Community and(even within the assumed maintenance of the general level of world prices) with the fluctuating prices at which commodities are on offer from third countries at particular times.     it follows, therefore, that anything in the nature of preciseestimating is impossible;     hut the result might he anincreased Fund requirement of the order of  30 million to 40 million.(ii)   The reduction in the Fund requirement for market support and export subsidies-as^a result of the United Kingdom marketbeing open to the Six.     Exports from the Six to the UnitedKingdom are bought at world prices and are thus eligible forexport subsidy from the Fund.     If the United Kingdom were amember not only could the Six expect to sell more here (thus reducing to some extent the need for market intervention) but what they sold in our markets would be at Community prices and would no longer involve an export subsidy cost to the Fund.An assessment of the possible changes in the volume and pattern of e.c. exports necessary to arrive at figures for these factorsis inevitably the most speculative item in any calculation.It could be of the order of some  40 million to  60 million atleast.     We should certainly expect it to more than offset theadditional requirement arising under (i) above,(iii)   The increased-cost of the Guidance Section of jthe Fund.     Thepresent limit of  100 million for the Six for payments forstructural improvements would clearly have to be raised uponthe enlargement of the Community.     The additional amount involved, however, cannot simply be equated with what mightbe needed for payments to a new market.     On the arbitrarybasis that it reflected the comparative size of agriculturalindustries, and taking into account the present limit of 100 million for Six members, the additional amount Involvedupon United Kingdom accession might be somewhere between 10 million and  15 million.5.     The net effect of all these changes could easily be to leave the totalFund requirement at about much the same level.     As against the Commission^present estimate of  580 million the range of possibilities for the newrequirement might be some  560 million to  595 million.6,     It is now necessary to turn to an assessment of the contributions whichmight be made by the United Kingdom as well as existing members.
United Kingdom Contribution jbo^ the FundContributions by member States to the Fund fall under two heads:the hand-over of 90 per cent of the proceeds of levies on Imports ofc.a.p. commodities from non-member countries, and contributions from national Exchequers on a fixed percentage scale,(-&quot;-)   Hand-over of levy proceeds.     To make a financial assessment itis necessary first to try to predict the development of UnitedKingdom production of the various commodities under theCommunity^ prices and arrangements.     Next, we have to predict what the level and pattern of United Kingdom consump-tion might be at Community prices.     From estimates of thesetwo factors, which clearly involve an- element of speculation,it is possible to form a judgment of our total import require-ment of leviable produce.     Then it is necessary to estimatehow much of this total import requirement would be likely tobe drawn from non-Community sources, and therefore be subjectto levies.     Finally, we have had to make an estimate of theactual amount of levy likely to be raised on these imports,commodity by commodity, on the assumption that the present general levels of e.c. and world prices remained unchanged.Obviously none of these factors can be precisely evaluatedand the possible distribution of our future imports betweenCommunity and non-Community sources is particularly difficultto forecast in these hypothetical circumstances.     The bestestimates we can reach, however, Indicate a range ofpossibilities round a mid-point of about  200 million for total levy receipts.     Under present Community arrangements,90 per cent of this sum, I.e.  180 million, would become payable to the Fund,(ii)   Fixed percentage contribution.  &apos; Under present arrangements the six made contributions to the balance of the Fund&apos;s require-ments according to the following fixed percentage scale -France 32.0$Germany 31.2$Italy 20.3$Netherlands      8.2$Belgium 8.1$Luxerib ourg        0.2$
It is impossible, by definition, for any of the existing members of the Six to know in advance what these percentagesmay represent in terms of actual cost to them in any one year,because this depends on how much of the total expenditure is covered by the proceeds available from levies.     For thisreason, and with the further complication that the percentagescale for the United Kingdom would obviously be a natter foractual negotiation, any quantification of this item can onlybe on a purely arbitrary basis.     For example, if we took forillustrative purposes roughly the same percentage as Franceand Germany, relative to the other members, then in a community of Seven, as distinct from Six, it would work out on the totalscale at 24 per cent.It has been estimated by the Commission that levy receipts from the six countries in the present Community may amount tosome  210 million at the single market stage.     discontinuance of levies on imports from the United Kingdom into the Sixcould reduce this by about  10 million, leaving a total levyincome of about  200 million from the Six.     Adding to this our estimate of the United Kingdom!s levy hand-over( 180 million) would give a total levy income for a community of Seven, of some  380 million against a total Fund require-ment of our estimate of something between  560 million and 595 million.     This would leave a balance of  180 million to 215 million to be met from fixed percentage contributions.On the hypothesis of a fixed percentage of 24 per cent forthe United Kingdom the cost would be in the range of some 45 million to o 50 million.7. On these assumptions the total contribution from..the. UJ1^sd_KLn^dom,covering levy hand-over and fixed percentage share, would amount to about 225 million, to  230 million.Net financial effects for the United Kingdom8.     Against a total payment into the Fund of between  225 million to 230 million, we could - on the basis of all the foregoing estimates - expect to receive -(i)    some  30 million to  40 million out of the Guarantee Section (fornarket intervention and export restitutions);-7-
(ii)   sone assistance from the Guidance Section of the Fund forstructural improvements.     On the assumption that our receiptswere equivalent to the whole of the increase assumed for GuidanceSection in the enlarged Community, this would amount to between 10 million and  15 million.9.     Total receipts from the Fund would, on this basis, amount to some 4-0 million to  55 million to set against some  225 million to  230 million,leaving a net deficit of the order of  175 million to  185 million.     /Tnaddition to the reservations expressed throughout this paper about theimponderability of many of the relevant factors in the calculations, and the impossibility of precise estimating for others, two further points should benoted.     First, the calculation, as requested, ignores the possibility ofother countries joining the e.c.;   and, secondly, it deals only with the net cost to the United Kingdom of contributions to the Fund not with the totalbalance of payments effect of accepting the C-APj/710.   It is clear, however, that even allowing for a very wide margin of errorpossible in any assessment of this kind, the extension to the United Kingdomof the Community&apos;s financial arrangements as they stand would substantiallyreduce the financial liabilities of the existing members and involve theUnited Kingdom in a disproportionate share of the cost of sustaining thecommon agricultural policy.
