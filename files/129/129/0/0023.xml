1 st May 1967CABINETUPRATIN&amp; OF SOCIAL SECURITY benefits memorandum by the Minister of Social SecurityBefore coming to office in 19Q+, we pledged ourselves that existing national insurance benefits would be raised and thereafter linked withaverage earnings.     The benefits were raised by 12s. 6d. on the singlerate of pension as soon as we could manage it, but there had been no general increase since.2.     When we replaced national assistance by the new scheme ofsupplementary benefits I agreed that on the next occasion the increase in benefits should be 1s. less than the earnings criterion warranted, so asto help pay for the supplementary benefits.     Last November the cabinet decided that the next general uprating should be postponed until nextOctober and further limited to 10s0, in order to moderate the general level of expenditure forecast In the 1966 public expenditure exercise.The Chancellor of the Exchequer now proposes (c(67) 69) that the 10s.should be cut to 8s. 6d.3.     8s. &apos;6d. would be the smallest increase in benefits, in money terms,since 1961, when the increase was 7s. 6d., and the smallest proportionate increase in the pension since 1952.     Indeed every uprating since then hasbeen larger in proportion than the rise in earnings, except in 1961.Even then, however, the benefit went up by over 5s. more than was requiredto counteract the rise in prices.     Details are given in the Annex.4.     On the latest forecasts of earnings and prices, an 8s, 6d. increase would be 2s. 11d. less than the rise in earnings ?rould justify and only1s. 7d. more than will be needed to match the rise in prices since march 1965.     I do not see what rational justification we could offer for so small an improvement.     If the increase were 10s., rational explanationwould be much less necessary and more easily found.64COPY NO.-1-(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT),
5,    We have had to restrain the rise in earnings, and have had some success in this.     But the 10s. on which the Cabinet decided last Novemberis still 1st 5d. less than would be needed to natch the forecast rise in earnings up to October, so that the pensioner would still be doing worse than wage-earners in general.     Moreover, we have acknowledged in ourprices and incomes policy that preference must be given to the low-paidwage-earner (defined by the Trades Union Congress as under  15 a week), sothat the pensioner will be falling still further behind the level of the lowest wages.     This is true with a 10s. increase, but much more so with8s. 6d.6,    We are now moving towards an incomes thaw, and we can expect a fairlysharp rise in the general wage level during the second half of this year.However successful we may be in restraining prices, this movement in wagecosts must presumably have some effect on prices in the months following the uprating.     But if benefits are raised by only 8s. 6d., the margin of real improvement of 1s. 7d., compared with the 19&amp;5 rates, would disappearas soon as prices had risen by about 1;J per cent.     The standard of living of pensioners would then be lower than in March 19&amp;5.     For the first timefor over a decade, the Government would be unable to claim that the existingbenefits were worth more than any previous rate.     Since we cannot expecta further uprating before the autumn of 19^9, this embarrassing situation would have to be defended for a long time.Contributions7,    We shall have to finance the increase of the insurance benefits by putting up the flat-rate contributions and the proportionate exchequer supplement, because we cannot look to the graduated pension scheme forfurther finance until we have reformed it.     The increase in the contribution Is, In any case, going to look steep because we need extraincome to match the higher level of sickness now prevailing and the trend towards earlier retirement, as well as the higher level of unemployment.Depending on the unemployment assumptions used, the total Increase in thestamp looks like being between 1+s. 4d. and 5s. for a 10s. pension increase,and only about 6d less for an 8s. 6d. increase.     I shall have to putforward proposals about the distribution of this extra burden between employer and employee, but the contribution increase is bound to look severe inrelation to the amount of benefit, and this will be greatly accentuated ifthe pension goes up by only 8s. 6d.-2-
Supplementary and other benefits 8.     The increase in supplementary benefits, with the interim increase inthe scale rates given last autumn, should match the increase in thenational insurance pension.     On this principle, if the single rate of theinsurance pension goes up by 8s. 6d., the rate of supplementary pension should go up by 3s. 6d.     This would be the smallest proportionate increase since 1948.9.     Increases in the subordinate national insurance benefits, industrial injury benefits and war pensions must be derived from the increase in themain pension rate.     With the latter at 10s., I have made a balanced set of proposals trimming some rates to make room for other improvements which need to be made from time to time.     Clearly, with an 8s. 6d. base, thereis less scope for this kind of thing, and it would not follow that we could achieve the full proportionate savings over the whole range of benefits.Conclusion10.   For these reasons, and particularly fairness to the pensioners, i must press my colleagues to uphold the earlier decision in favour of anuprating geared to 10s. on the single rate of pension.M.H.Ministry of Social Security, W.C.2.1st May 1967-3-
