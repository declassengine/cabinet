NOTE BY A GROUP OF PERMANENT SECRETARIES1.        The attached report has been prepared by a working party of officials and Economic Advisers in accordance with the instructions ofCabinet on 6th April.    It is not a wholly agreed report!  and we mustdraw attention to the qualifying note in its concluding paragraphs.2.      We suggest that Ministers, in considering the report, shouldhave the following points in mind -(a) It is relevant to compare our likely condition as a full member ofthe e.c. in the mid-1970Js with our likely condition if we are not amember by the same period.    If, by 1975, the e.c. is still in being asa going concern, with 8 years of further progress towards larger-scaleforms of economic and industrial organisation appropriate to a community of approaching 200 million people, it is scarcely arguable that the existence of so large an economic unit on the other side of theChannel would have some effects on our relative position as an economiccompetitor and, therefore, as a worthy object of investment.    In sofar as those effects were adverse, they would constitute an important element to be taken into account in our calculations of the net economic advantage or disadvantage of membership of the e.c..    It is alsorelevant, for the same reasons, that the erosion of Commonwealthpreferences is likely to continue and that EFTA cannot be counted on to persist indefinitely in its present form.(b) Entry into the e.c. will have advantageous, as well asdisadvantageous, effects on our balance of payments.    We have notedthat the working party have attempted to quantify the adverse forces but have not found it possible to do the same for the advantageous forces.Moreover, the quantification Is based on the explicit assumption that &quot;weshall have accepted the Treaty of Rome and the regulations made under it without modification (paragraph 8)&quot;;  and the report itself admits that&quot;The present figures may therefore over-state the adverse effect of membership on our balance of payments if we succeed in negotiatingmore favourable conditions before or after entry&quot;.    As a result, despiteits many repeated reservations, the report-seems to us to be liable tocreate a misleading impression.    Since it was not possible to quantifythe positive elements, it is necessary, in attempting to form a balancedjudgment, to rely on a qualitative assessment of the many considerations which the report itself admits are imponderable, including the extent towhich we may succeed in modifying the adverse factors in negotiation.That this view was held within the working party itself is evident fromthe qualifying note.    It is important, therefore, to emphasise that thereport, as is made clear in paragraph 4, &quot;must not be treated as a forecast of the balance of payments&quot; but is, in a sense, only anabstraction of certain elements, themselves highly speculative in total,from a situation in which many other factors would certainly be at work,not least the influence which we ourselves could bring to bear on the policies of the Community, once we were a member.
(c) The domestic adjustments which, the report emphasises arenecessary before the beginning of the transitional period are notessentially different from those which are required in order to achieve the Governments economic objectives in the medium term which havebeen approved by Ministers and were the basis of the Chancellor of the exchequers recent Budget.    We think it important to emphasise thispoint.    It means that the policy which is an essential preliminary toentry to the e.c. is one which Ministers have already endorsed as necessary in any event.(d) A certain timetable is implicit in the report.    It is assumedas a working hypothesis that, if we entered the Community, there wouldbe a transitional period of at least five years, during which tariffswould be reduced and abolished and we should progressively adopt theagricultural arrangements of the Community.    It is also assumed thatthe obligations of that transitional period would probably not start muchbefore 1970.    The hypothesis of this timetable seems to us to be acceptable.    Even if we are able to secure formal entry into theCommunity well before 1970, it will not be unreasonable to have as our objective that the obligations which not only we but also the othermembers of the Community will have to undertake should not begin totake effect significantly before 1st January, 1970.    Indeed, it wouldprobably be unrealistic to adopt an earlier date, even if we wanted it.(e) The report indicates that, in order to offset the disadvantageouseffects of entry on the balance of payments - in particular the modification of our present agricultural system - we shall have toensure a very significant increase in our exports and that this is unlikely to be achieved without some &quot;worsening of the terms of trade&quot;.    By this we understand an increase in our relative competitive power, resultingfrom increased industrial productivity;  the maintenance of an effectiveprices and incomes policy;  the promotion of technological development;and so forth.    All these factors are already the declared objectives ofGovernment policy.    We do not, therefore, regard it as beyond our capacity to achieve the necessary &quot;worsening of the terms of trade&quot; bythe policies which we are already pursuing, provided that we do notrelax our efforts to make those policies effective and that we can operate on the basis of the timetable implicit in the report.    That timetable is both compatible with, and dovetails satisfactorily into, our present policy objectives.    We have to secure a satisfactory surplus on thebalance of payments of a size sufficient to enable us to discharge ourIMF debt.    This is the objective of policy between now and 1970.Membership of the Community, with a transition period beginning in1970 and continuing for at least another five years, will mean that the restraint on consumption, public or private, which will be necessaryin any case between now and 1970 would - on the assumptions inthe report - have to be continued, and perhaps intensified, throughoutthe transitional period in order to ensure that additional resources weremade available for export.    At some point during this period, and increasingly thereafter, we should begin to reap the benefits in industrial efficiency and increased productivity which will flow from membership - benefits which, as the report admits, &quot;may be very great,though they are unquantifiable in balance of payments terms&quot;.    Thus,provided the timetable is acceptable and provided that we do not relax the pressures designed to switch resources from consumption to export bothbefore 1970 and thereafter during the transitional period, there is nothing in this report to require us to think that the balance of paymentsproblems arising from our entry into the e.c. would be unmanageable.
At its meeting on 6th April the Cabinet agreed that o wishould he prepared by officials in consultation with theEconomic Advisers of the economic effects of entry to the Com-munity if this were in 1967, or alternatively in 1968, and that areport should be submitted on the total effect of entry on our balance of payments.2o     We begin by emphasising that the effects on the British economy of entry into the E.E.C will be very much affected bythe economic conditions prevailing at the time of entry.    It isclearly essential that the U.K.  economy should be fully competi-tive prior to entry, with an adequate surplus in the balance ofpayments, and efficiency-wages^  at a level adequate to preservethis surplus in face of the adverse effects discussed below.This alone would ensure conditions favourable to growth.    Ifthese conditions were not fulfilled, not only would there be amuch greater danger after entry that investment, both Britishand foreign, would be directed towards other parts of theCommunity and so aggravate any deficit in the balance of pay-ments, but it would also be necessary to maintain restrictivepolicies that would offset the advantages expected from member-ship and risk a cumulative deterioration in the economic positionof the U0Ko    &apos;vVe cannot regard the balance of payments in 1967 asmeeting these conditions,    It is affected by a number of abnormalcircumstances,  such as a l^w level of stock building, so that itappears to be more favourable than the underlying trend;  it is obviously inadequate for long-term purposes (quite apart fromthe need to repay debt).    If the resources necessary for a continuing surplus of the order that Ministers have thought necessary are to be released,  there are major domestic adjust-*Efficlency-wages are a measure of the competitive position. Theymay be defined as the cost of labour,  including social insurancecharges,  in relation to output per head.
merits still to Toe made.    They entail a reduction of-the orderof 2-k percentage points in the share of total output goingto personal consumption, depending on decisions to be taken on the size of public expenditure in the next few years.They correspondingly entail a rise in public revenues as a proportion of total income,  though this may he partly in theform of higher local authority rates and increased charges bynationalised industries.    It is essential that these domesticadjustments, which will have to be made in any event, becompleted before entry if the disadvantageous developmentsdescribed above are to be avoided.3.     We have worked on the assumption that the interval before the beginning of the transitional period can hardly fail to extend over the next 18 months and that it might very well extend to the beginning of 1970.    Clearly, the longer the interval,  the less the difficulty in completing the necessaryprior adjustment in the use of resources and in improving thebalance of payments.IIk.     Quite separate from these adjustments which are necessary before entry are the adjustments necessary to deal with theeffects of entry.    We have assumed that we shall be able tosec tire a transitional period 19 give us time to make theseadjustments and we have concentrated on the total impact thatentry would be likely to have on the balance of payments atthe end of that transition period.    We have assumed that fiveyears wauld be a reasonable measure of its general effect.This is without prejudice to the fact that we may seek and obtaindifferent transitional periods for different purposes.   Our estimaterelate, therefore,  to a year in the middle seventies, and dealonly with the effects of membership,    We have not consideredany other influences on the balance of payments at that time.Our estimates must not be treated as a forecast of the balanceof payments.
5.     Entry to the E. E0 C. will cost us the...advantages wehave so far enjoyed from importing food at world prices andfrom our preferential trading arrangements with the Common-wealth and E.P. T.A.    Entry will bring with it new circurn-stances, some advantageous, some disadvantageous?  we canneither specify them in detail nor quantify them.    Thismeans that we can assess the effects of entry on the U, K,balance of payments to only a restricted extent.    We canattempt to indicate what may be involved for the balance ofpayments and the disposition of U.K. resources of somespecific changes, notably in respect of agriculture,capital movements and tariffs.    But we cannot go on to measure the total effect of entry,6,      Quantification of the apparently measurable effects onthe balance of payments    of joining the S,S,C,  is necessarilya highly speculative undertaking.    Any attempt involves makinga large number of assumptions,  some more arbitrary than others but all open to argument.    The resulting estimates are bound to be no more than the product of all the assumptions made in their preparation and cannot therefore do more than illustrate crudely the direction and magnitude of changes which must be expected..    It is peculiarly difficultto decide on the most appropriate assumptions,    This is so for three main reasons.    First, it is not known on what conditions we shall be able to  join the Community nor how itwill develop after we have joined.    Secondly, there are allthe difficulties in translating into numerical  terms theprobable short-term responses of consumers and producers tothe changes in prices and market opportunities  that member-ship will bring.,    Thirdly, there is little or no agreed bodyof doctrine on the long-term changes of trend in industrial structure, location and efficiency that would be set on foot:certainly none as to magnitude and very little even as to direct ion,
SECRET 1257,      There are, however, a number-of&apos; &quot;estimates, which havealready &quot;been made by officials of some of the effects.These are summarised below, and brought up to date wherever possible.    They relate to agriculture,  capital movements andtrade in manufactures.    These items are not independent ofone another.    For example,  in so far as increases in food prices and the cost of living resulting from adoption ef thecommon agricultural policy lead to compensating increases in money incomes, this would weaken our competitive position as amanufacturing country.    Similarly, the flow of capital to orfrom this country will be affected by the competitive strengthof British industry,   and in particular by the post-tax  rateof return en new investment in the U.K.a% against other3,d&quot;.G.  countries.8.      One important asumption is that we shall have acceptedthe Treaty of Rome and the regulations made under it without modification.    The present figures may therefore over-state the adverse effect of membership on our balance ef payments ifwe succeed in negotiating more favourable conditions before or after entry.    It should also be noted that the estimatesbelow contain no allowance for the extra charge on thebalance of payments which would flow from any compensation we decided to grant any Commonwealth country whose economysuffered as a result of diminished access to the U.K.. market.AG^ULTURB9.     The cost of accepting the common agricultural policy asit stands is probably the firmest of the figures that havebeen hazarded in assessments of the balance of pay^g-ntsimplications of joining the 3,J,C., hut even this calculationhas to rest on many assumptions;, for example   about world and Community prices.

has been put in the range of  175-250 million in the early1970&apos;s0    We would expect as an absolute minimum to be ableto negotiate a transitional period, so that the full balanceof payments cost would not be felt in the earlier years,, but would rise gradually,though not necessarily evenly.    we might also hope for some adjustment of the Financial Regula-tions.CAPITAL MOVEMENTS10.    This is an extremely uncertain area.    The most recentassessment by officials of the possible effects on capital movements (for the visits to E.E.C, Heads of Government)assumed entry only jn conditions of a strong balance ofpayments.    The range of possibilities was wide, partlydepending on the changes in controls that could be negotiated     They ranged from slightly favourable to con-siderably unfavourable.    The order of magnitude was indicatedin the analysis by a range for additional net inflows of 50-85 million; and of additional outflows of, say, 70-11+5 million, including  hO million for the foreign exchange cast of liberalising direct investment in Europe.11.    It is reasonably certain that if we joined the common market, capital would come to flow far more freely under theinfluence of profit considerations betvi/een the different countries of the Market than is normally the case withforeign investment, because the risk of changes in exhange rates normally associated with foreign investment would be largely removed and there would be a guaranteedtariff-free trading area.    This means that whether theeffect on net U.K. direct investment would be favourable orunfavourable would largely depend on the relative levels of&quot;efficiency wages&quot; in the U.K.  and in the other industrial areas of the Common Market.    Hence from this point of view the question of competitiveness is all-important.5
12.    The creation of large international concerns comparablein size and effectiveness to the large U.C. firms is one ofthe great economic advantages likely te fellew from the creationof the Common Market,  and it is to be expected that Britishindustrialists would play a leading role in this process of integration,, Since the London capital market is  far more  .developed than that of Paris, Frankfurt or Milan, it isprobable that more of the money for this integration process.;&apos;&apos;^V;&apos;&apos;: .. :-&apos;-:-:.;y&apos; .; -.&apos;    S.      :will be raised in the London market than in the Contirentalcountries.    For the same reasons we cannot count on   Frenchand German firms investing on a similar scale in the U.K.  evenif the profit opportunities are favourable.  though we couldreckon - assuming that we are competitive - that more of theU.S.  foreign investment will   be concentrated on the U.K.Hence,  though it is quite impossible to quantify the neteffect,  it would be prudent in our view to reckon on aconsiderable amount of net investment by the ILK.   in theCommunity, and to allow for a further  50 million for netadditional outward direct investment beyond that envisagedearlier.CJM^-g-IK-yMISlS. AND PR EFERENCBS13.    In addition to the abolition of tariffs between ourselves and the other E.E.C.  members (presumably subject to transition-al arrangements) membership would entail changes in preferentialarrangements vis-a-vis the Commonwealth and E.F.T.A.    Theeffects i?f tariff cuts on trade flows are always complex and so little is clearly established that any calculation is largely arbitrary.Ik-   The general lines of the changes are clear:  there wouldbe more trade both ways between the U.K.  and the E.E.C.,partly additional and partly diverted from other channels.    Weshould sell less to the Commonwealth and buy less from them.If all other members of E.F.T.A.   joined E.E.C.  we would-
lose all our preferences in their markets;   E0F0T.A, countrieswhich did not come in would almost certainly raise tariffs against us as we imposed the common external tariff on our imports from thenuIn both cases we should lose exports. - Our imports from 50F.T.A0would fall   (partly to the gain of E.E.C. suppliers).    In trade withthird countries, e.go U.so. ,      Japan and the Eastern bloc, bothexports and imports would be below the levels that would otherwise have been reached, reflecting diversion of trade towards the EoEoC.15,   The gx*eat problem comes in attempting to quantify these changes.Various attempts have been made, but the results are entirely depen-dent on the assumptions made about the magnitude of trade flows onwhich tariff and preference changes are operative, about price changes consequential on tariff changes and about elasticities.    Oneset of estimates made recently by the Board of Trade, based on the pattern of exports to various markets that might have developed by theearly 1970&apos;s, suggests adverse effects in balance of payments termsranging from  50 million to  200 million, depending on the assumed.mptionsmade.COST AND PRICE CHANGES16,   The potential effect on costs is clearly critical to the wholeassessment.    They flow very largely from the changes in agricultural policy. If nothing were done to offset it, the adoption of the common agricultural policy must mean higher food prices.    The ultimateincrease in the cost of food has been estimated, on certain assump-tions about relative prices levels, as equivalent to 2^-3i per cent011 total consumers&apos; expenditure.   There would also he some rise in &quot;the costs of industrial materials formerly imported free of tariff.   Onthe other hand, there would he lower prices of some imported semi-manufactured and manufactured goods formerly subject to import duties and perhaps some competitive reduction in prices of equivalent home produced goods, though this offset is likely to be small.    Taxation7
changes, in particular the introduction of a tax on value added,could affect the cost of living, hut we have not attempted anyassessment of such effects0    It has not been possible to make anestimate of the total effect of membership of S.E.G, on prices.17,   Although a rise in consumer prices by itself would reduce therate of growth of real consumption and so contribute to achieving the required further transfer of resources from consumption to exportsuggested by the analysis in the following paragraphs, it could hardly fail to increase the pressure for higher wages as workers attempted to maintain their living standards0   How strong this would be isdifficult to predict.    The rise would be spread over some time and itcan be argued that its effect on wage claims would he less than if itwere to happen all at once.    Against this, the rise is concentrated on food prices, and this may well mean that it would provoke a strongerreaction than another increase, equal in total effect, but morediffused in its impact.    To some extent it would he possible to reducethe pressure on wages by fiscal action (e.g. in mitigation of the risein prices).   But there would remain a danger that dearer food wouldgive a fresh inflationary impulse to the economy and so endanger ourcompetitiveness and the balance of payments.    There are no precisenumerical relationships established with which to demonstrate thepossible effects on costs, prices and the balance of payments.   Oneset of assumptions of the effects on prices, if no steps were taken tomaintain competitiveness, is that a rise of 2-g- to 3i per cent inconsumer prices could lead to a 1^ to 2 per cent rise in money wagesand this in turn to a rise of i  to if per cent in U.K. prices at theend of the day.    Such an increase in export   and domestic prices could,depending on the assumptions made about export and import elastici-ties, produce potential adverse cost effects on the balancer;f tra d e of  150 to  350 million.    This is a measure of the dangers that could result if adequate steps were not taken to maintaincompetitiveness:   but we repeat our warning about the arbitrary andillustrative character of the arithmetica8

19.    It would,of course,be impossible to contemplate an actualdeterioration in the balance of payments cf the magnitudesuggested above.    It would be necessary to ensure that in one way or another external balance was maintained, and this wouldbe facilitated to the extent that&apos; industry does seize the opportunities of specialisation that the larger market offers,ourBut in seeking to expand/exports or reduce our imports on thenecessary scale we should be obliged to trade on less advantageous terms and offer lower prices so that we had to produce and sella larger volume of goods in exchange for a given volume ofimports.,    This would be part of the price of avoiding a deficitand would leave that much less to be divided between domestic consumption and investment.20.    From the point of view of cost to the economy the fouritems in Table 1 all have a different significance.    Item (i)(b)?as indicated above,  reflects a weakening in the competitive position and could be eliminated without making any demand onreal resources if the forces making for higher export costs wereoffset by other forces restoring the competitive position.Item (lii) would make it necessary to run a correspondinglylarger surplus on current account and this would require an equiva-lent   reduction in domestic consumption or investment.    this item does, therefore, represent a charge on resources althoughit also generates an asset in the form of a claim on foreignresources.    In the case of item (ii) the balance of payments effect is a measure of the loss in our competitive position which weshould have to restore in some other way.    The final cost interms of resources of the tariff changes is roughly equal to the deterioration that we should have to accept in our terms oftrade in avoiding the worsening of our trade balance consequent on the tariff changes.21.   This leaves item (l)(a), a large part of which represents a straight transfer to, the Cemmunity at our expense.10
Another part takes the form of an increase in domestic production at higher cost than the imports displaced,    ii/e thinkthat the cost in domestic resources under the heading of the cemmonagricultural policy would tend to he rather higher than thebalance of payments costs  and that It should he puttowards the upper end of the range  175-250 million,22o   The direct agricultural and investment effects,taken together, would involve an additional loau. on resourcesof the order of  250-hOO million.    This, however, takes no account of the adverse change in the terms of trade that wouldhe required in order to &quot;bring about an increase in exports (ora reduction in imports) sufficient to secure the necessaryexternal surplus and to offset the potential balance ofpayments loss on account of tariff changes.    How large this change would have to   be is uncertain: we can only make whatseem reasonable assumptions about the price reduction needed to achieve any given extra volume of export sales.    On these assumptions the total load on resources might be between 300 and  650 million by the end of the transition period.It must again be stressed how precarious this whole pyramid ofcalculations is.Ill23,     So far we have considered only the adverse effects.    Butthe consequence of membership of the Community on our industrial efficiency is crucial,    If the spur of greater competition and larger scale markets results in an acceleration of the under-lying grewth of productivity; the problem of maintaining a competitive cost position is likely to he that much easier.    the potential opportunities, provided we are and continue to becompetitive, may he very great,  though they are unquantifiablein balance of payments terms.    The views of both the production department and industry in general (notably as reflected in theC.B0I. Review) are Ahat, on the whole,industry would seize the opportunities which membership offered.    On the other hand,  it11
can be argued that our ability to continue to benefit may be restricted by inherent structural limitations that cannot be quickly eliminated,,      It is impossible to predict with any assurance what the long-term effect on efficiency of partici-pation in the B.S,C. will be;    this is essentially the point where a judgment of probabilities has to be made.iv.2h.   The problems involved in managing a transfer of anything like this order would depend a great deal on the length ofthe transitional period after entry.      If it were five years,the net additional claim on resources would mount throughout theperiod by an average of the order of  100 million a year.      Inother words,  an extra  100 million a year of&apos; resources would haveto be diverted in each year from home use (presumably public endprivate consumption) to export and import-substitution in orderto enable us to accept the common agricultural policy ana all theother obligations of membership without the balance of paymentsdeteriorating.25,   A total of, say,  100 million a year to be shifted from home use to export can be compared with an expected annualaddition to gross national product of the order of 3 per centor  1,000 million (of which not less than  250 million Tjryuld be exported in any case).     Thus the total required might absorbabout a tenth of the annual growth of output over five years, ora smaller f action over a longer period,  if a longer transitional period were obtained.      Since over half total exports of goods and services are the product of manufacturing industry, theextent of the shift of manufacturing output would be greater,and past experience dees not suggest that it wculd be easy to bringabout.     We have not attempted to predict precisely how the diversion of total output might be secured.

growth of personal consumption.     To some extent this would he brought into play automatically by higher food prices and thechange in the terms of trade.     But to the extent that it wasnecessary to make use of higher taxation,  the extra tax revenuerequired would be substantially more than the reduction in consumption which it was intended to secure.      This squeeze on personal consumption would follow on the squeeze prior to entry to which we referred in paragraph 2, and would again reduce the share of consumption in G,N,P. compared with what it could otherwise then be.     The sacrifice of personal consumption wouldhe a substantial fraction of the prospective rate of increase,)f consumption in the early seventies.      However,  the domesticadaptation required after entry would not he greater than the domestic adaptation required before entry, and which will benecessary whether we join the E.S.C.  or not.26.   If industry seizes its opportunities, this will manifestitself in an increase in the rate of growth of industrial productivity, and this would enable us in time to recoup theresources cost of entry.       For example,  if the effects of rationalisation, increased specialisation and the exploitation of the economies of scale were to lead to an increase in the rateof growth of industrial productivity of roughly ^ to 1 per cent a year above the present trend rate of about 3-5 per cent a year -which would not he unreasonable - the total cost of entry interms of resources would be recouped in about five years.Moreover,  if such growth of productivity were to show itselfduring the transition period,  the net cost of adaptation wouldbe reduced, and consumption could be allowed to rise a littlefaster, though it would be unwise to count on so early a benefit from membership.13
SUMMARY OP CONCLUSIONS27o     It is essential that the U.K.  economy he fully competitiveToy the beginning of the transition period, with an adequatesurplus in the balance of payments0    A surplus of the order neededcould not be secured unless there were a release of resouroesthrough a reduction of the share of output going to public and private consumption.28,     The longer the interval before the beginning of the transition period, the more manageable these domestic adjustmentscould be.29.     The effects of entry would be of two kinds.      First,  therewould be the changes resulting from tariff changes,  the loss tfpreferences, the abandonment of our present agricultural import and support policies,  and the dismantling of our present restrictions on direct investment in Europe to the extent thatthese have not been dismantled earlier.      Secondly,  there wouldbe the dynamic effects on industry flowing from entry into alarger market with the opportunities for specialisation which that would offer.     The first can be measured, though the calcu-lations are precarious and the hypotheses on which they are basedare uncertain.     But there is no question that they would have asignificantly adverse effect on our balance of payments.      Ourcalculation of these adverse effects suggests they lie between 250 and  600 million, and this does not Include other possible consequences on our prices due primarily to the higher cost of foodwhich cjjuiIcI introduce further adverse effects on the balance ofpayments of the order of  1 50 to  350 million.     For the second,the C.B.I. consider that there would be &quot;a clear and progressivebalance of advantage to British industry from membership of an enlarged E.E.C.&quot;, and most members of the Working Group share thisview though some have doubts.     The advantages could be verygreat, provided that the U.K. economy was competitive at thebeginning of the transition period and that policy was adequate tomaintain this competitiveness.     But it is not possible to give
any indication of the order of magnitude of such possiblefavourable developments.30.   Those developments that would certainly be adverse could notbe allowed to work themselves out and produce a deficit in thebalance of payments.    Indeed, to the extent that industry becomesmore efficient as a result of entry, that would in itselfcontribute to preventing the emergence of such a deficit.    Butin any case we could not expect large increases in exports or in import substitution without a worsening of the terms of trade.31,    In order to avoid a deficit on the balance of paymentsresources v/ould have to be switched from consumption to export and import substitution.    One estimate of the shift of resourcesthat would be needed to offset all these adverse effects,including an appropriate allowance for the necessary adversemovement in the terms of trade, would lie between  300 and  650million.    If there is a transition period of, say, 5 years, itwould mean on average a shift of the order of  100 million in eachof the five years.    At 3% growth the annual addition to the gross National Product would be at least  1 ,000 million in theseventies, so that about a tenth of this would have to betransferred from consumption to export and import substitution.The burden of the further adjustment required after entry - interms of the allocation of resources which we would have to makethroughout the transition period - is not likely to be greater thanthe burden of the adjustment required before entry - and whichwe must make in any case, but it would be additional to it..To the extent that growth is faster - and, if industry seizes itsopportunities, it could be - the need to squeeze consumption wouldbe that much less. Even if this advantage did not manifest itselfduring the transition period, the cost of entry could be recoupedover a comparatively few years, if specialisation and the economies of scale led - as they could - to an increase in the rate of growth of productivity.
32.     One member of the Working Group wishes to add aqualification to the Report, as follows.;33,     The remit to the Working Group was to report on the totaleffect of entry on our balance of payments.    This effect wouldresult from a combination of forces, some clearly adverse,  othersnot necessarily so, depending on the overall competitiveness ofthe economy.   Like earlier studies this one emphasises (paragraph 6)how highly speculative an undertaking it is to quantify even theapparently measurable forces.    All the same it goes on to abstractfrom the totality four factors - agriculture,  tariffs andpreferences, foreign investment and higher costs.    It attaches tothem figures (see table 1) that are necessarily unreliable as a guide to policy (though the agriculture figure is less unreliablethan others) because so much depends on the assumptions on whichthey are based.     The existence of potentially favourable factorsis recognised.    However, when they defy quant ification - the response of British industry is acknowledged as the crucialexample - it becomes increasingly unreal to pursue the argument in statistical terms.3h.     The Working Group as a whole did not accept that there &quot;was this limitation on its search for quantitative truth, even thoughit has to admit in paragraph 23 that it has constructed a precarious pyramid of calculations.    But it is misleading to offerMinisters such calculations, purporting with a spurious air ofprecision to strike a total balance, as an aid to one of the mostimportant policy decisions they will ever take.    Since over so large a part of this field we do not know the answers, it wouldbe better to say so or to confine ourselves to qualitativeexposition of the issues.16
