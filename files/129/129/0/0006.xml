EiPLIC ATI ONS OF ENTRY INTO EUROPEFOR UHITlIb KINGDOM PLANCTG- POLICIESReport by the Official Committee on Environmental PlanningAt their meeting on 6th April the Cabinet agreed that an inter-departmentalstudy should be made by officials of the effect of entry into the EECon United Kingdom planning policies taking account of the influence whichwould, in any event, be exerted by the opening of the Channel Tunnel on industrial development in the South East of England.2.    While entry into the Community might have long-term effects whichcould affect planning policies (for example, as a result of changing trends in tourism, or movements on retirement) it is clear that the most important influence would be the effect on our regional economic planning policies which are aimed at ensuring a proper balance between the various regionsand in particular at reducing the disparity between the development areas and the rest of the country.     The Official Committee has, therefore,concentrated its attention on this aspect of the problem.     Paragraphs 15 to 17below, however, refer to some other important related aspects.3.     It is assumed in this paper that Ministers are satisfied, as a resultof the enquiries made in Europe, that our existing development&apos; area policiesare compatible with membership of the e.c..     The support given by eec countries to their less prosperous areas is largely in the form of various measures of financial assistance:   negative controls over the location of industry are much more limited in their extent than In the United Kingdom.So far the measures of financial assistance do not appear to have been on the same scale as ours.     The effectiveness of e.c. programmes of support for less prosperous areas may well develop, and there is some evidenceof a current move in this direction:   but we have assumed that the programmes of the e.c. countries are never likely to become substantially more attraotiveto industry, in total effect, than our own policies.     In the longer term,in this field as in others, there will no doubt be pressure for theharmonisation of national policies.4.    A major element in our regional policies is the encouragement ofindustry to set up in the development areas end a corresponding pressure to discourage industrial development in the Midlands and the South Eastby the refusal of industrial development certificates (i.d.cs.).     before considering what effects there might be on this system it is necessary tomake a judgment on the general effects of membership on internal direct investment of United Kingdom firms and on outward and inward investment, sincethe volume of new industrial development in the United Kingdom largelydetermines the supply of mobile industry.     For this purpose we have assumed that Ministers will not decide to open negotiations unless they are satisfied.    SECRET
that we are fully competitive with European industry, that membership would beto our general economic advantage and would thus lead to increased industrial investment by United Kingdom firms in the United Kingdom.     This accords withthe conclusions of the CBI Europe Survey;   % per cent of their sample enquiryexpected British membership would lead to more home capital investment bytheir firms, 55 per cent considered their investment would be the same and only 2 per cent considered it would drop.Location of industry.     It has been argued that the position of the United Kingdom on the edge ofEurope will lead to the movement of industry towards the economic centre ofEurope - both out of Britain towards the Continent and within Britain towardsthe South East.     Studies of industrial location, including those of recentindustrial development in the Common Market, demonstrate that growth tends to concentrate mainly in those areas where it has already occurred, through theattractive power of higher relative rates of growth of output and productivity,and higher relative levels of income and larger markets, as against the dis-incentive of relatively higher wage levels.     The location of major growthindustries (chemicals and synthetic fibres, electronics and electrical equip-ment, office machinery, motor vehicles and consumer durables) favours thefurther development of the most successful areas, against those dependent ondeclining industries (coal, steel,ship-building, cotton textiles etc).     Inthe United Kingdom these tendencies towards further concentration of growth inthe South East and Midlands have been largely held in check by our presentregional polioi.es.    Within a wider European Community, in the long term, thesame tendencies and the strength of the instruments of regional policyavailable to Member States, will continue to be of the first importance in the pattern of industrial location.     However, in the medium-term (perhaps thenext 10-15 years) transport factors are likely to be particularly important inthe determination of industrial location.     Eventually, the widespread use ofcontainers in trade with Europe and the opening of the Channel Tunnel willeliminate much of the extra costs and delays of transport across the Channel:but until the necessary improvements in transport are made, there is a risk that inferior transport will act like a tariff, and encourage British firms to locate on the Continent and e.c. firms to locate within Britain.     Because the eec offers a contiguous land market of some 1 SO million consumers against great Britain&apos;s 53 million, it seems likely that more United Kingdom firms willlaunch &quot;pilot&apos; plants in the Six than vice versa.     For some of the UnitedKingdoms largest firms the incentive will be particularly strong;   but the behaviour of other United Kingdom firms is less certain.     There could be apronounced &apos;follow my-leader&apos; effect, but equally they could decide to wait to learn from the experience of the larger firms.     So, although on balance itseems likely that in this introductory period British moves to the Continentwill outweigh Continental moves to Britain, the relative magnitudes are hard to predict and will in part depend on the success we may have in raising ourown rate of growth to levels comparable with those in the e.c..
SECRET 5 36.   Total capital- expenditure in United Kingdom manufacturing industry-alone was some  1,400 million In 1966 and over  2,600 million in total in that year if distributive and service industries are included.   Ofthis perhaps some  160 million represented investment &quot;by overseascompanies.   The dominating element of investment by United kingdom firms illustrates that it is on the growth of this element that we are primarily dependent to produce projects which can contribute to theGovernment&apos;s location and planning policy.   Foreign investment in theUnited Kingdom, while valuable in this connection, can hardly beexpected to provide more than a proportionately modest contribution.7.   As regards the inflow of direct capital investment into theUnited Kingdom, North American investment averaged  130 million inrecent years.   United States firms in deciding their investment policies in Europe will have regard to the total situation in each countryincluding the funds they have available for Investment there,opportunities for raising capital locally, any inducements being offered, the supply and quality of the labour, and accessibility of markets.   They will also be influenced by language considerations andtheir views on political stability.    They will choose whatever locationis likely to provide the best base for expanding the market for their products and to maximise their profits.   In view of the overall levelof inducements offered by the United Kingdom, particularly in thedevelopment areas, and our relatively favourable showing in respect ofmany of the other factors mentioned above, the United Kingdom would belikely to continue to be attractive, especially to North American firms,as against other members of the e.c.,    It is thought that additionalAmerican investment might eventually build up to as much as 50-70 million a year.  Bu&quot;t for the first five years after entry it maybe more prudent to reckon on an additional inflow of  40-50 million ayear, mostly from the Unites States, but including  10 million inflowfrom the Six.    Some of this investment will represent the expansionof existing firms so that not all of it is new investment which mightbe &quot;steered&quot; to development areas.8.   Direct investment by United Kingdom firms in the e.c. (excluding oil)has been around  35 million in recent years.   Assuming that onmembership our present controls on direct investment into the e.c. wouldhave to be removed (with or ;?ithout a transition period) it is estimatedthat there would be additional investment by United Kingdom firms in the eec of perhaps  45-50 million a year - not all this figure, however,represents investment which would otherwise have taken place in theUnited Kingdom.    The calculation takes account of the fact that Corporation-3-
Tax will increasingly bias United Kingdom firms towards investmentat home rather than overseas, and that if the United Kingdom Is Inthe e.c. there would be no reason for United Kingdom firms to investthere in order to overcome the tariff barrier ,(The figures in this andthe preceding paragraph are taken from the brief on capital movementsprepared for the recent visits by the Prime Minister and foreign secretary to e.c. Heads of G-governments.)9.   Taking account of the expected increase in investment by UnitedKingdom firms in the United Kingdom and the balance of outward andinward flows considered in paragraphs 7 and 8 above the Committeeconcludes that on balance there is more likely to be an increase of   -capital investment by industry in the United Kingdom than the reverse,if the United Kingdom joins the e.c..10.   As regards the distribution of Industry within the United Kingdomthe most important questions are -(a) whether entry into the Community would make United kingdom firms less willing to esxablish new factories in thedevelopment areas;(b) whether it would become more difficult to persuade foreignfirms to establish new factories in the development areasrather than in the Midlands and the South East.(c) whether such growth of employment as is not dependent upon theissue of i.d.cg,   will tend to be faster in the South Eastand the Midlands because of e.c. membership.11.     If there is greater total investment in the United Kingdom and if some of this consists of more foreign investment, the opportunities forsteering new investment to the Development Areas will be increased.It must be accepted that some firms would put up a greater resistance to attempts by the Board of Trade to steer them to Development Areas ifthey were free to build new factories on the Continent,   But the numberof firms who were refused an i.d.c. in the South East or the midlands and who would, in practice, decide to develop on the Continent ratherthan elsewhere in the United Kingdom is not likely to be large.   Thegeneral run of firms  depend on a United Kingdom base for their activities and these firms are not likely to move to Europe with the problems oflanguage, management, etc.   The financial advantages of establishing anew factory in the Development Areas (particularly if it is decided to
proceed with the proposals for a regional employment premium) might wellcounterbalance any advantage which the firm would see in establishing a factory on the Continent.   The new towns and the overspill areas are also existing options for certain firms in the South East andMidlands wishing to expand and unable to go to Development Areas.The influence of i.d.c. and other policy varies with the size of firm.Big firms in deciding their locational policy are less likely towant to expand in the more congested parts of the South East anyway,because of labour supply problems.   Intermediate sized firms whichwant to expand, but which are not big enough to split, tend to want to stay where they are.       If they are in the South East then theytend to argue that somehow or other they can attract labour.   the aim of these firms is essentially to stay where they are, and inthese circumstances a threat of moving to Europe is rarely likelyto be a plausible counter by a firm when asked to conform to theGovernment&apos;s location policy.    I.d.c. policy is, of course operatedflexibly at present and where special circumstances justify, i.d.cs.are given now to permit expansion in the South East and Midlands evenin areaS other than the new towns and overspill localities.   If a firmseemed determined to go ahead with a development on the Continent ifan i.d.c. for a development in the South East and Midlands was notgranted, and if It seemed desirable to prevent this, it would bepossible in such exceptional cases to permit a new development in theSouth East or the Midlands, but in such cases, it would be hoped thatthe development might be used to benefit a new town or overspill areathus achieving a second aim of the Governments location of industrypolicy.     While recognising that freedom to move to Europe would introduce a new option for mobile industry, overall it seems improbable that this possibility would radically change the balance of industriallocation within the United Kingdom.12.   As regards United States firms, it seems improbable that entry intothe Community would make it more difficult to persuade them to establishnew factories in the Development Areas.    It has been the general experiencethat United States firms are less resistant to pressure to set up in theDevelopment Areas, presumably because their connections with industryin other parts of the United Kingdom are less close.   Apart from financialinducements for location in the Development Areas, which are likely to-be at least as strong as anything available elsewhere on the Continent,-5-
there are other advantages such as the availability of labour whichwill continue to influence the decisions of managements.   Europeanfirms setting up in the United Kingdom will be doing so to exploit the United Kingdom market and are, therefore, more likely to want to stay near the main concentration of purchasing power in the South andMidlands.   The overspill and new towns in these areas, where in anycase there is likely to be a greater demand for industry in thefuture, could be attractive locations to such firms.   Although thiswill lead to a slightly greater strain on labour resources in these areas it will not seriously affect overall regional policies.13.   The regional implications of the Channel Tunnel are at present under examination by officials.    The general view is that the openingof the Tunnel will not, in itself, run counter to the Government&apos;sregional policies, or create difficulties in the administration ofi.d.c. controls.    The possibilities for through movement betweenEurope and all parts of Great Britain should materially assistmanufacturing industry in regions outside the South East, providedthat the necessary communications network (both road and rail) is established.   The planning of through rail services is only in its initial stages, but British Railways have it in mind to provide linertrain services to the Continent from industrial centres in various parts of the country.   The advantages of this service from a regionalpoint of view will depend to some extent on the charging policies ofBritish Railways.Ik-.   The considerations in the previous paragraph are also relevant in considering the expansion of industrial employment which occurs outsidethe scope of the i.d-o. control because it is not associated with new factories or factory extensions above the exemption limit.   This hasbeen an important factor in the growth of the South East and the Midlands,and could be more important if entry into Europe conferred competitiveadvantages on these regions.   Although even with improved internalcommunications firms in these regions will still retain some of theirpresent competitive advantage for sales to the Continent, they will alsobe more vulnerable to competitition from Continental firms in their own home market.    So en balance there is no reason to fear that regional policy will be frustrated to any greater degree than now by the growth of that part of industrial employment which is outside the scope of thei,d.c. control.
Other Planning Considerations-15,   Our entry into the e.c. should lead to a stimulus in British commercialactivity and to the transfer of some European commercial offices to theUnited Kingdom.     This would he likely to increase the demand for officespace in London and the South East.     A proposal hy an international firm toestablish its European headquarters in London could bring such advantages that it might be accorded special treatment.     But this is likely to be theexception.     The general transfer of activity is not likely to be undulysignificant, and in so far as our entry into Europe leads to an increased demand for office employment in London, there seems no reason to think thatit would place undue strain on the existing control.     As part of the policyof limiting the demands for office employment in the South East and london the Government has dispersed a substantial proportion of direct Governmentemployment to other parts of the country.     There would be no reason tolessen the vigour with which this policy would be pursued.16.   There will be regional implications for United Kingdom agriculturearising from the differential impact of the common agricultural policy on different classes of producers.     This Issue has been separately considered in the report submitted to the Cabinet on agriculture and the Common market and is, therefore, not further discussed here.17.    The estimation of migration is important.for physical planning purposes.The increased employment which it is thought should be generated in theUnited Kingdom as a result of membership of the Common Market might lead toan Inward flow of migrants from the continent under the free movement oflabour provisions of the Treaty of Rome.     The report already submitted tothe Cabinet on the implications of entry into Europe for mobility of labourand immigration policy concludes, however, that membership of the common market is not likely to lead to any substantial additional influx of labourbecause the Community itself is short of labour and has to rely on recruit-ment of large numbers of workers from Spain, Turkey, etc.     Nevertheless,the total addition to population in the long term, with its consequentialeffects on housing demand, might become of some significance.Conclusion18.   This paper Is based on the assumptions (set out in paragraphs 3 and above) that Ministers are satisfied that our regional policies are compatible with membershhp of the EUC, that on our entry United Kingdom industry would be fully eompetitive with European industry and that membership would be to our general economic advantage.     On these assumptions, and allowing for theinfluence of a Channel Tunnel, there seems no reason to expect that entrywould create serious difficulties in the operation of controls over thedistribution of industry or of office development.     Indeed, if entry were to result in a substantial addition to net direct investment in the United Kingdom,the effects on planning policies both in the development areas and elsewhere(for example, in the so-called &quot;grey&quot; areas) would be beneficial.     No otheradverse effects on the operation of our physical planning policies has been identified by the Committee.    SECRET-7-
