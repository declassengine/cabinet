this document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S GOVERNMENT)C(67) 742nd May, 1967COPY NO.CABINETCONCESSIONARY FARESMemorandum by the Minister without portfolio the Minister of Transport brought before the Home AffairsCommittee at their meeting on 28th April a proposal that she should announce shortly the Government^ intention of introducing legislation to extend the provisions of the Travel Concessions Act, 1964, which gave local authorities permissive powers to arrange travel concessions on municipal buses.    The Home Affairs Committee did not feel ableto agree that a decision should be taken in advance of the currentpublic expenditure survey and were unable to approve the proposal tomake an early announcement.     The Minister of Transport has asked that the matter should be considered by the Cabinet.    The purpose ofthis paper is to indicate briefly the considerations that were beforethe Home Affairs Committee and the points on which the Cabinet are asked at this stage to take a decision.The proposals.      The Minister cf Transport seeks authority to make a general statement of the Governments intention to legislate next Session for thefollowing purposes among others -(a) To enable local authorities outside London to arrange travelconcessions, except for children, for,local journeys on non-municipal buses as well as on municipal buses.     the concessions could be provided for the old, the blind, the disabled, students travelling for educational purposes and members of the local authority travelling on duty.(b) To put a statutory obligation on municipal and non-municipalbus uperators tc give the concessions, which are as amatter of existing practice given to children up to varyingages, to all children up to the school leaving age.It is not at this stage proposed to deal with the situation in London whichpresents a different problem because of its size and the availability ofunderground and local rail services but to consider how the concessionscan be introduced in London in the light of the proposed re-organisationpf London transport.-1-
The Cost of the Proposals3.      The cost of the existing concession on municipal undertakings isat present about  2-f million a year and if all the undertakings were touse their permissive powers would be about  3 million a year, of which 2 million would fall on the rates.    The cost of extending the concession to non-municipal bus undertakings is estimated to be a maximum ofabout  9 million a year, of which  5 million would fall on the Exchequerthrough the rate support grant.    This is on the assumption that all localauthorities gave the concessions and the maximum figure would probably not be reached for some time.    The extension of the concessions toLondon might add another  5 million to the cost, making a total of  14 million.The Case for the proposals,     The arguments put to the Home Affairs Committee in support ofthe proposals were -(a) That the Travel Concessions Act 1964 removed the anomaliescreated by the Act of 1955, (which froze the then existingconcessions) but created new ones, for example, many areas are served by both municipal and non-municipal buses or bymunicipal services run jointly with non-municipal ones sothat concessions cannot be organised even on *,he municipalcomponent of the joint services.(b) That the statement made by the Minister of Transport in theHouse of Commons on 4th May, 1966 that she would review the situation &quot;in order to see what amending legislation, ifany, was necessary&quot; and the knowledge that she has been inconsultation with the local authorities have created expectationamong the public and the authorities themselves, most of whomwish to have some additional powers of the kind proposed, thatthe Government will take action.(c) Political support for such action has been reflected in a private member Js Bill introduced by Mr. Bob Brown,(d) In exchange for a statement of the Government^ intention to legislate Mr. Bob Brown might be persuaded to withdraw his Bill (which is unsatisfactory in form and ought not tobe given a Financial Resolution) before it reaches committee stage on 10th May,The Contrary Arguments5.      The following arguments were advanced against taking animmediate decision to legislate on the lines proposed -111(a)    In principle it has been found better to help the elderly and the disabled by cash benefits than by concessions in kind whichcan be enjoyed only by those able to use the service inquestion.    On the analogy of the tobacco concession, there might be a risk of pressure for a cash allowance in lieu.Cash benefits have been and are being raised and theextension of concessions in kind would merely create furtheranomalies.-2-icbNFIDENTlAi.
(b) There is a difference of principle between enabling localauthorities to give concessions on their own services and enabling them to give concessions on those of privateoperators.    An extension into that sphere would open theway to pressure for concessions on other forms of transport and for other forms of service.(c) The present would be an awkward time for the centralGovernment to make concessions throwing a furtherburden on the rates.(d) Apart from their merits on principle the proposed concessionsare a form of social security benefit which ought not to beconsidered in isolation from others such as family endowment,school meals and the uprating of national insurance benefitsat present under consideration.    Decisions ought to be takenin the light of the public expenditure review and of the othercomponents in the social security package,(e) In any event there is no justification for providing a financial resolution for a Private Member&apos;s Bill, the main purpose ofwhich is to provide for new public expenditure; nor shouldthe existence of a Private Member&apos;s Bill be allowed to force the Government to reach premature decisions on expenditure.The Conclusions of the Home Affairs committee.      In the light of these various considerations the Home AffairsCommittee took the view that no decision on the principle of the proposalsfor legislation should be taken in advance of the public expenditure review and of the consideration of other items of social security expenditure;that since Mr. Bob Brown ought not, in any event, to be given a financial Resolution it was unnecessary to promise government legislation in order to persuade him to withdraw his Bill.    If, in viewof the expectation that had been aroused, it became necessary to say anything, the Minister should say chat the question of extending the concessions fell to be considered in the context of the current review ofpublic expenditure.conclusion.      The Cabinet are asked to consider -(a) Whether a statement should be made in the near futurecommitting the Government to enabling local authorities toextend travel concessions to non-municipal buses on thelines of the proposals indicated in paragraph 2.(b) Whether the decision of principle on extension of local authoritiespowers should be deferred until the concessions can be examined in the light of the public expenditure survey and of decisions on other items of expenditure on social security benefits.-3-
(c)    Whether, if it became necessary to make anv statement onthe Governments intentions, the Minister of transport should limit herself to saying that the question of extendingtravel concessions will be considered later in the session in the context of the Governmentzs review of public expenditure generally.P.
