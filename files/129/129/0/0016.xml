,., DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY GET HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY [S GOVERNMENT)HIS66Cj67]il. COPY NO* --27th April, 1967CABINETBRITAIN AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY;Lnggjdl-i^^^^ countries memorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth affairs at the meeting of the Cabinet on 20th April (CC(67) 22ndConclusions, Minute 2), my colleagues invited me to circulateinformation about the likely reactions of other commonwealth countries to an early decision by Her Majesty ls Government to apply for membership of the Community.,2.     The following assessment is based on the latest information obtained from High Commissioners and from recent contacts with ministers of other Commonwealth countries.New Zealand3.     After the Prime Minister ls statement of 10th November, 1966,Mr. Holyoake sent a message to Mr. Wilson saying that New Zealand&quot;must have a permanent solution, that is, one which endures beyond any transitional provisions for Britain&apos;s entry&quot;.    When I met theNew Zealand Cabinet in February, Mr. Marshall again stressed theneed for a permanent solution,    Mr, Holyoake said that Britain should join the Community and gain in strength since New Zealand would benefit from this provided that her vulnerable position was fully recognised.4.     The prospect of British entry into the Community has been thesubject of lively and intensive comment in the New Zealand press.    Itis widely accepted that Britainrs eventual entry is inevitable;  but every confidence is expressed that Britain will safeguard New Zeala.o.drsessential interests,Australia5.     Great interest has been shown in the prospect of British entry.In general, press and public reaction has been mild and even sympathetic.Commercial circles have accepted the possibility of British entryrealistically, pointing out that Britain^ importance to Australia as asupplier and customer is in any case on the wane.     The press has,however, expressed concern about the effect of entry on Britain&apos;srole East of Suez.
1 7 Q.1 s o6   When I met the Australian Cabinet in February, Mr. McEwenargued that a transitional period would not meet the needs of Australia,and that, even if she were large enough to stand the strain of our entryin financial terms, she could not do so in human terms through standing by and seeing her sugar growers, butter producers and fruit farmersruined.7      when  I saw Mr. McEwen again in London on 24th April, he saidthat, although he accepted the British Governmenfs declared intentionof safeguarding essential Commonwealth interests was made in good faith, he had only modest expectations of this being achieved.    he therefore attached particular importance to the successful conclusion of world commodity agreements, especially one covering cereals.Canadaft.     While the present Canadian Government has expressed noenthusiasm for British membership, it views the prospect morerealistically than in 1961.    At the recent meeting of the Anglo-Canadian Ministerial Economic Committee (the relevant extracts fromthe record are attached), Mr. Martin said that Canada recognised thata decision whether to apply was a matter for Britain and he appreciated the desire of Britain to play a full part in European co-operation andtrade.    At the same meeting, Mr.   Winters said that although theCanadian agricultural sector would be affected, it was neverthelessfelt that Britain must do what was in her best interests;  Canada hadthe assurance that Commonwealth interests would be safeguarded.European Commonwealth9.     Cyprus is watching developments with intense interest becauseof their importance for her own position vis-a-vis the Community.     Pressreaction has been favourable.     There has been no official reaction from malta.    Editorial comment there welcomed the new initiative.     Theconsensus of press opinion is that Malta cannot afford to wait any longerand that the Government should soon start negotiations for its own entry into, or association with, the Community.Caribbean10. All the Caribbean countries are concerned about the future of theCommonwealth Sugar Agreement. The Prime Minister of Trinidad andTobago has written to the Prime Minister about it.The Jamaican authorities are also concerned about the futureof JamaicaTs bananas and citrus J  indeed, they consider heras just as much in need of special arrangements as New Zealand.It seems likely that they will receive any announcement of britain^ intention to apply for membership with grave misgivfcags.Trmidad^will also want to preseive her protected market in britain for citrus.    However, for some time, Trinidad hasassumed that Britain will join the Community and has directedher policies accordingly,     Trinidad is not worried unduly that commonwealth preferences might eventually disappear.
Apart from their concern over the Commonwealth sugar agreement, an announcement that Britain will apply for membership is unlikely to cause much stir in Barbados orGuyana.      The Barbados Government will probably interpret t&quot;as a loosening of British commercial ties with Barbadosand they are likely to align theinselves more closely with america as a result.Africa^11. Among the African Commonwealth countries, Nigeria (who hasalready concluded an agreement for a limited form of association withthe Community which has still to be ratified) and Kenya, Uganda andTanzania (who have applied for a similar form of association), haveshown little interest in the British initiative.     Press comment showsZambia to be anxious to retain a favourable market for her tobacco.Press comment in Malawi has been restricted to expressing the hope thatMalawits interests will be safeguarded.    Three countries. The Gambia,Sierra Leone and Ghana, have expressed interest in association with theCommunity,    Ghanaian officials welcomed the British move cautiouslybut said they would prefer to await the review of the YaoundeConvention ir. 1968 before considering any move.     There has been noreaction in Lesotho.    Botswana has expressed interest only in safe-guarding the British outlet for her bsef.Asia12,    Beth the Government of India and the press have so far shown a fairly relaxed attitude towards the prospect of a British application tojoin the Community.    Eventual British entry is viewed as logical andcertain.    Officials have, however, expressed some apprehension incase a deliberately quick negotiation would not leave time for adequateconsultation.    Our High Commissioner considers that the presentquiescence can be interpreted as meaning that the Indian Governmentare holding their fire.    Strenuous representations can be expected from them later about the effects on their own interests if we decide to go ahead.13.    It is unlikely that any announcement will cause strong reactions in Pakistan.    Both officials and the general public have long expecteda British application.      They are likely to be mainly concerned aboutthe future of their industrial exports to Britain, but their attitude ishkely to be speculative rather than hostile.14.    In the view of the High Commissioner, it is unlikely that the-^Yi0.^ authorities will have any substantive comments to make at thisstage.    No other significant local reaction to a British decision to go ahead is expected.    Singapore has recently expressed interest in thepossibility of association with the Community.     The Government ofMSiSIiiL have up to now seemed little worried by the prospect of thesmall loss of preferences involved for them in our entry.    But it ispossible that the proposals for reducing our defence expenditure in^e Far East may lead them to comment that our policies towardsope seem to be taking precedence over our commonwealth  /ealth ties.
Concision15. My general impression is that, following the 1961-63 negotiations,other Commonwealth countries have regarded our eventual entry intothe Community as inevitable and, with the possible exception of theWest Indies, are therefore unlikely to react strongly to a decision to initiate negotiations.     This does not mean that they will fail to pressus strongly to ensure that we negotiate terms of entry which reallysafeguard their essential interests.     Their present comparativelyrelaxed attitude may therefore be more apparent than real.     We must expect them to concentrate their efforts not in hostile reactions to adecision to apply for membership but in presenting their individual cases forcefully in the course of detailed consultations which they willexpect to be thorough and meaningful.H. W. B,Commonwealth Office, S. W, 1,26th April, 1967-4-C0M FIDE NTS At
On the economic side the problems had been narrowed down to a small number of important ones.   Some could best be settled once Britain wasinside the Community.   The Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary had beenreassured that Britain would continue to be free to implement her ownregional policies.   There were problems of immigration still to be solved,though it appeared that the Treaty of Rome was of itself no obstacle.   Theway it actually worked was of more importance than theoretical powersembodied in it.   Problems on the British side had been narrowed down to agriculture, Commonwealth problems and capital movements.     On their sidethe Six had been worried about the international position of sterling.There were four main aspects of the agricultural problem -(a)   It was expected that the application of the levies to Britain&apos;imports of agricultural products would increase the cost of living in britain by about 3I per cent.   This was offset to some extent by theimport of cheaper manufactured goods.-5-ANNEX^mjj^GjgF^aLO-cyril)IM MINISTERIAL ECONOMIC COMMITTEEEUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITYFirst Session(Extract from Minutes of Meeting at 10 downing Streeton 19th April 1967)THE PRIME MINISTER said that his statement of 10th November 1966would be well known to the Canadians.   Since then, he and the foreign secretary had completed a successful tour of the capitals of the Community.That had been largely a political operation and was not concerned with thedetails of negotiation.   He was now sure that the Six were satisfied of britain&apos;s sincerity and the desire to make a reality of our entry providedthat essential British and Commonwealth interests could be safeguarded.The talks with President de Gaulle had been very friendly and many of his previous anxieties had been assuaged.   The President had, however, saidthat Britain&apos;s entry would change the nature of the Community;    it wouldbecome bigger and weaker.   President de Gaulle had likened British entry tothe addition of more coaches to the European train, but the Prime minister had assured him that vie would in fact be adding another engine.   In europe as a whole there was strong support for British entry - not the least ofLuropean anxieties were concerned with Germany and the possible resurgenceof a German Nazi party.     Mr, Kosygin had also been worried about theposition in Germany but had been relaxed about Britain&apos;s approach to theCommunity.   He had said it was for Britain to decide.   Pie had appeared tohe impressed with the argument that british entry would create an easingof tension within Europe and that Europe would become more outward looking.
(b) More serious would be the balance of payments problem as Britainvrould have to pay more in levies than the rest of the Community puttogether, and 90 per cent of the levies would have to be transferred tothe European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee fund.   This might havean adverse effect on the balance of payments of about  200 million a year.(c) The Commonwealth countries who would be the most affected by theBritish entry into the Community were those producing temperate foodstuffs and those party to the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement,    Some commonwealth countries were solving their own problems by applying for Association;the East African countries were doing so at present and it was possiblethat some West Indian countries night also do the same,(d) There would also be the problem of the distortion of the presentpattern of British agriculture.   Some types of farming would continue tobe prosperous but others would be squeezed, though British agricultureas a whole would be likely to be more prosperous.It was difficult to make firm pronouncements on the effect of british entry on capital movements.   THE PRIME MINISTER doubted if there would beany adverse effect on direct investment.   There would probably be a two-way movement of portfolio investment.   One possible difficulty here wasthat it seemed possible that the Community could provide an escape route for British investments e.g. into the United States.   The internationalrole of sterling was prominent in the discussions.   The Six were worriedthat we would regard Article 108 of the Treaty of Rome as obliging them to underwrite difficulties that we might encounter in consequence of theworld-wide uses of sterling.   The Prime Minister gave them an assurance that Britain would not invoke Article 108 in the event of the strength of sterling being adversely affected by external factors;   we would, as inthe past, rely on the International Monetary Eund and the Basle arrange-nents rather than on the Community as such.   The Cabinet were newconsidering all these questions in great depth, and it was hoped that adecision could he reached in the next few weeks.   It was essential thatthe momentum should not be lost.   If possible a decision would be reachedbefore the Yftiitsun recess as, in view of the fact that the Prime minister would be visiting Canada immediately after the recess, there would other-wise be a delay of about three weeks.   The British Government were watching the progress of the Kennedy Round with interest.   THE PRIME MINISTER

If possible a decision would be reachedbefore the Whitsun recess as, in view of the fact that the Prime minister would be visiting Canada immediately after the recess, there would other-wise be a delay of about three weeks.    The British Government were watching the progress of the Kennedy Round with interest.   THE PRIME MINISTER
doubted the truth of the argument that a British application to join the Community before the outcome of the Kennedy Round was known would allow the French to say that it was not possible to make further progressin the Kennedy Round negotiation.   However, it would obviously be useful to get the Kennedy Round over first.ICR. MARTIN said that Canada recognised that a decision whether toapply was a matter for Britain.   He appreciated the desire of Britain toplay a full part in European co-operation and trade.

DRURY asked how it was proposed to safeguard Commonwealthproducers.   THE PRIME MINISTER replied that it was hoped that it wouldbe possible to carry over some of the provisional agreements of the1961-63 negotiations.   MR. MULLEY, however, made the point that many ofthese were now no longer appropriate, especially those regarding temperatezone countries.   THE PRIME MINISTER said that there was no hope of changing the common agricultural policy on grain.   He had been interested to see that some of the Six were importing as much grain as ourselves.Between them they had imported 19 million tons in 1965-66 from the outside world.   British production on the other hand was rising and imports werefalling;   present Community target prices would encourage this trend.THE PRIME MINISTER concluded by saying that he looked forward tovisiting Canada at the end of May, that the Commonwealth Secretary wouldbe ready to discuss Rhodesia with the Canadians at later sessions, andthat Mr. Mulley would be at the afternoon session to continue thediscussion on the European Economic Community,MR. MARTIN expressed his appreciation for the exposition which thePrime Minister had given.

MARTIN expressed his appreciation for the exposition which thePrime Minister had given.
SECOND SESSION(Extract from Minutes of Meeting at Marlborough house on 19th April 196?)MR. MULLEY recalled that the Prime Minister had given to the Canadian ministers a brief resume of the talks that he and the Foreign Secretary had had in the capitals of the Six.     The Canadian Government had been informed about these at the time.     The British Cabinet were at present engaged in an intensive study of all aspects of the position.     Consultations would haveto be on a hypothetical basis in advance of any decisions being taken on whether and in what form to apply for entry.     It would not be satisfactory to try to keep a decision quiet for a number of days, while the BritishGovernment consulted the Commonwealth and EFTA partners.     Even if adecision were taken, important considerations such as the duration of negotiations and the eventual date of entry would not be within british control.     The important thing for Britain and her partners would he toagree on transitional periods.     In advance of the Cabinet&apos;s decision, itwould not be possible to say what britain&apos;s minimum terms would be, but theCabinet would naturally take into account anything that Canadian Ministerssaid at this stage.MR. WINTERS said that the Ganadian Government looked on the decision as one for Britain to take.     Canada was keenly interested on both politicaland economic grounds.     There would, of course, be trade implications, andan e.c. including Britain would be responsible for a third of total world trade.     The direct impact of British entry on Canada would depend on theterms and conditions of entry as well as on the Kennedy Round and subsequenttariff negotiations.     If Britain adopted the e.c. tariff and trade regula-tions as they stand at present Canada would lose the historic free entry on more than half of Canadian exports to the British market&apos; and be faced withpreferences in favour of their e.c. competitors.     The trade which would beaffected in this way included practically all Canada&apos;s cereals and fisheriesexports to Britain, well over one-third of her sales to Britain of other agricultural products and almost 90 per cent of Canadian semi and fullymanufactured sales to Britain.     In the industrial materials field, almosthalf of Canada&apos;s exports to Britain would no longer enter duty-free,including such major items as newsprint, aluminium and wood pulp.     Canada&apos;sexports to Britain of soya bean oil, tobacco, cheese, flour and a wide range of manufactured goods would face not only the loss of preferences but also would have to face the higher tariffs of the Community.     Altogether about-8-
three-quarters of Canada&apos;s exports to Britain would stand to face less favourable terms of access to Britain than at present.     Yfliile trade wouldprobably continue in many of the products affected, it would be lessprofitable and no doubt in many cases it would be reduced.     On the otherhand, success in the Kennedy Round would ease Canada&apos;s position, particularlyin agriculture if there were a cereals agreement, but also in the broadindustrial sector.     Reduction of the KD&apos;;C&apos;s protection on manufactures and/ : .&apos;&apos; &apos; &quot;S:processed foodstuffs would also be beneficial.     Canada would face someinitial problems and losses, but stood to gain in the long term if Britainand Europe could obtain improved prospects of economic growth and stability.In response to questions, MR. WINTERS reiterated that&apos; the agriculturalsector, particularly cereals, would be important for Canada, and alsomanufactured goods In relation to which Canada was still a developingcountry.     MR. GREENE pointed out that the agricultural community in canada would be the first to bear the impact of Britain&apos;s entry.MR. MU1LEY said that, if the Cabinet decided to apply for entry thiswould be because the Government considered that there were reasonable pros-pects for influencing the e.c. to be more outward looking as well as for growth and stability in the British economy.     Previous negotiations had shown that it was not possible to re-write the common external tariff aspart of bilateral negotiations.     These wider problems would have to beIsolved in a world forum.     Transitional arrangements would have importanteffects on the initial impact, and the British Government could promise the closest consultation and exchange of information.     MR. MULLEY confirmed thatit would not be possible to negotiate changes in the common agricultural policy as part of the terms of entry;   it was clear, however, that an enlarged community, including other countries such as Denmark, would need totake a further look at detailed agricultural problems.MR. GREENE indicated the increasing need for wheat to meet world foodneeds and the possible dangers of discouraging producers;   but the meeting-accepted that an enlarged community would still need to purchase food from outside and that incentives for producers were a problem for the kennedy round negotiations.     MR. SHARP said that he had been interested to learnthe British estimate of the balance of payments consequences of adaptingthe financial system of the eec&apos;s common agricultural policy.     He also referred to the possibility of pressure to speed up the tariff alignmentbetween the United Kingdom and the Six during a transitional period afterentry.
MR. MARTIN concluded by saying that the Canadian Government appreciated the importance of this discussion on the eve of the British Government&apos;decision.     The question of British entry into the e.c. had been before theCommonwealth for some years.     The Canadian Government welcomed with satisfaction the statement that Britain would hope to make an enlarged community more outward-looking.     The decision of the British Governmentwould be understood as a desire to share in a wider Europe.     Under no circumstances should points of detail mentioned by the Canadian Ministersbe interpreted as seeking to deter Britain from making a positive decision.The Canadian Government wished the British Government to be aware of the short-term effects on the Canadian economy if Britain joined but they were themselves aware of the long-term advantages of an outward-looking common market.     It had been suggested that Canadian circles had once sought toprevent British entry;   nothing that had been said today should be interpreted in that sense.-10-confidential
