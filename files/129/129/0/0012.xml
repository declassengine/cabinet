his document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67) 62 COPY&quot;NO.25th April, 1967CABINETOP0LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL IMPLICATIONS OFUNITED KINGDOM MEMBERSHIP OF THE EUROPEANCOMMUNITYMemorandum by the Law officers as requested by the Cabinet (CC(67) 21st Conclusions, Minute 3),we have considered the Report by officials attached to E(66) 7, and havethe following comments on the legal and constitutional implicationsdiscussed therein.Implementation of the Treaties2.       The preparation and passing of the Acts implementing the treaties would be a major legislative operation.    We v/ould be facedwith the task of unravelling the categories of Community law which havedirect internal effect and which would require to be incorporated into thelaw of the United Kingdom.     There would also be need to amend aconsiderable body of our existing Acts.    But these are problems whichcould be overcome.Sovereignty of Parliament3.       British constitutional doctrine is that Parliament is sovereignand that no Parliament can preclude its successors from changing the law/.    It is, hov/ever, implicit in acceptance of the Treaties that theUnited Kingdom will not only accept existing Community law, but alsowill refrain from enacting future legislation inconsistent withCommunity law.    This requirement thus detracts from Parliamentarysovereigntyr    Such a restraint on our legislative system would not,however, be unprecedented.    Our legislation often takes account of treaty obligations (for example, the Charter of the United Nations,North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade, the Ottawa Agreements of 1932), which restrict our futurelegislative freedom.    Further, several Acts of Parliament have reducedfor all time vast territorial areas of our sovereignty (the various acts of Independence granted to India, etc. ).
However, the continuing incidence of future Community-legislation would be withoxxt precedent and would present us withcontinuing legislative and constitutional problems.    Not only wouldParliament have to refrain from enacting future legislation inconsistent with Community law, but future Community law would have to beaccepted as binding on us.    The United Kingdom Parliament could pass legislation enacting that Community law should prevail over UnitedKingdom law if any conflict arosej but there is in theory no constitutional means available to us to make it certain that no futureParliament would enact legislation in conflict with Community lav/.    Inour opinion, if Parliament did in future enact such legislation expresslycontradicting Community law, the Courts would apply that legislation,despite its repugnance to Community law.However, we think that this theoretical possibility could, inpractice, arise on a matter of importance affecting the Community, onlyin political conditions in which the United Kingdom had in any case decidedto break with the Community.The risk of inadvertent contradiction between future UnitedKingdom and Community law will not be great.    After we join theCommunity, we shall be taking part in the preparation and enactment of all future Community law.     Our participation would thus enable usto reduce the likelihood of incompatibility between the Community lav/and our domestic law.Character of the Community Law4.       Community law has little direct effect on the ordinary life ofprivate citizens, their rights and obligations.    By far the greater partof our domestic law will remain unchanged.    Nothing in the Treatiestouches our criminal law, matrimonial law, law of inheritance, land law,the law of tort, or negligence, or contract (save in relation to restrictive practices), the relations of landlord and tenant, housing or town and country planning.    Direct taxation would not be affected.    Nor is there any reason to expect the creation of future Community law in these fields,for the power of the Community to create new law is limited to thepurposes set out in the Treaties which cannot be enlarged except by unanimous agreement.The main impact of Community law would be in the realms of trade,customs, restrictive practices and immigration.    It would also affect theoperation of the iron and coal industries.Courts5..      We understand that there would undoubtedly be a British Judge(and perhaps a British Advocate General) at the European Court!  we regard this as an important safeguard.We agree that it would be quite possible to assimilate Communitylaw and rulings of the European Court into our own systems.
We consider that the United Kingdom Courts would be likely torefuse to hold that Parliament had by implication repealed or amendedany part of Community law.    But if Parliament were to pass an Actexpressly derogating from Community law, we consider that the UnitedKingdom Courts would regard themselves as bound to give effect to theAct even though this involved a breach of the Treaties.Safeguards for the Protection of Individuals6.       We regard it as important that there is a right of appeal to theEuropean Court, which we believe to be a Court of high standards, fromCommunity decisions which affect individuals and corporate bodies.We consider that the various powers of the Commission toauthorise its inspectors to enter premises, inspect books and interrogatepersons is acceptable, provided that such powers are not normallyexercised in this country without an order made by a United KingdomCourt.International Relations7.       The requirements under the Treaties would restrict ourindependence of action in future international dealings, and would, broadly speaking, have the effect of transferring to Community institutions our power of concluding treaties on tariff and commercial matters.    Weconsider that this would be an inevitable and acceptable consequence ofour acceding to the Treaties.As a matter of international law, we would have no right towithdraw from the Treaties unless there was a fundamental change in circumstances (e.g. if one of the member States were over-run by aforeign power).    We regard this as somewhat academic;  if for any reason, the United Kingdom decided to withdraw, and an Act ofParliament were passed for this purpose, we find it difficult to imagine that our Courts would not give effect to it.    Withdrawal from the treaties would certainly be an immensely complex operation.F.E. J.G. S.D.F.H. S. W,The Law Officers1 Department, W.C.2..25th April, 1967SECriET
