President &quot; for the Kennedy RoundAs I shall be returning to Geneva next Tuesday for what i hope will be the final phase of the Kennedy 3.ound negotiations,it may be helpful to you and your colleagues if 1 make a shortreport on the  state of play as I see it.GeneralThe British Government is committed to securing a successfulresult from the Kennedy Round and has taken the view that sucha result would be beneficial whether or not we were to join theCommon Market.    Our whole negotiating position has been basedupon this and the e.c. have hitherto been negotiating with us inthis spirit;   only once, in connection with steel, has there been any suggestion that we ought to make a concession., not because it was justified as a bargain, but because it would please thecommunity.    I hope that we can continue to keep these two matters from becoming entangled.Though it has -been agreed that the substantive negotiations should finish at the end of April, progress has been very slow,largely because the omniunity have been reluctant to move. TheFrench have hinted to us that they think that they will get thebest deal for themselves by hanging back until the last moment.My own guess is that we shall reach a conclusion by about7th May and that the last week will be the most critical.Positive OffersWe have converted our original offer, which was on theindustrial side a very short list of exceptions from a linearcut and on the agricultural side a specific list of offers,into a consolidated &quot;positive&quot; offer list setting out in detail the specific tariff reductions that we are offering,,    We haveadjusted our original proposals to take account of what we regard as inadequate&apos;.of f ers f rom the United States and the Community.Positive offers will probably be  tabled   in the course of nextweekj   we shall then no doubt be accused of excessive par imonyandhave some strenuous bilateral negotiations from which our final offer will emerge.    We shall continue, in accordancewith our instructions, to do our best.,to secure a fair balancewithout putting ourselves in the position of being accusedwith any show of reason of wrecking the Round.Sector ProblemsA.   Chemicals;    Here the argument is not about what thetotal solution snail be, but about the stages by which itshall be achieved.    The Americans cannot abolish the AmericanSelling Price formula without getting Congress to legislate.The Community want to hold the whole solution back until this legislation has been passed, while the Americans wish forsome partial application before they legislate.    We have proposed, by way of compromise, a form of instalment plan,.but have so far got no thanks (at least from the Community)for our pains.   The Community intend to stand on their refusal to consider a partial application-., but I may reasonably say that in the end some face saving arrangements will be devised.CONFIDENTIAL
D* Textiles;    We have made no offers at all on cotton textiles though the others have, and out reasons are wellunderstood,    Wc shall have to withdraw our offer on wooltextiles, as the United States will almost certainly be unable to make any worthwhile offer to us.    The community and the United States will probably reduce their offers on man-made fibres, but our tariffs are exceptionally highand we proposeelement in the general industrialafford to make a reduction.to maintain our offer,bar&apos;as it will;ain and webe a usefulcan wellCereals,   Hussions have been extremely slow   chxefly becauseof the inability of the exporters to arrxve       -ny conmondecision.    They have now made proposals which are unacceptable to the importers.   They have proposed a ?inim^ P&quot;c* ?Lrity 1.85, whereas the maximum figure for ,wnxch we have auth.rxtyis  1.70.   The Community seem prepared to settle ^ a Pncebetween  1.72 and ^V.74, but the Japanese are even moreanxious than we are for the lowest possible prxce and a reasonably satisfactory solution should be possible,    ^naccess, the Community, and particularly the French   are anxious to secure the highest possible   ratio   and   on presentinstructions will.not go below 90 per cent     ^-^not yetribVe^o figure and the minimum ,- 2 -3 3B. Steels    Here we are regarded as the villairiSo   Wehave refused tc offer any reduction in our tariff, since theCommunity&apos;s offer simply restores their tariffs to the 1957level for which we paid them in our bilateral agreement withthe coal and steel Community,    The Community arc seekingharmonisation of the steel tariffs of the industrial countries and pressing us to move without being willing to improve their own offer to us.    Unless this obstacle can be overcomethere is a risk that the whole steel sector will be left outof the Kennedy Round, and that the effects of this nightspread into the engineering sector.   We may, therefore, needauthority at a later stage to offer some token move withoutreciprocity,C Vehicles;    The Community offer excludes heavy commercial vehicles, while we have offered a 50 per cent reduction forthe whole of the sector,.    The British industry has been pressingus to withdraw our whole offer if the Community refuse to includeheavy vehicles, but have now modified this position to theextent that they are prepared to acquiesce in a reciprocalreduction of the tariff on cars and light commercial vehiclesonly if the Government deems this necessary to secure a settlement.It is in this sector that there is the greatest riskof the Community and ourselves giving an unrequited benefitto the Americans and the Japanese should we eventually join the Community;    but despite this it seems desirable to secure a tariff reduction which will substantially reduce thebarriers against the entry of our cars and light commercial vehicles to the Community.    We shall seek specific instructions on this point when the issue is clearer.
of 10 per cent for which we have .authority.    On food aid wehave offered to consider the inclusion of a modest element of aid in an otherwise satisfactory package.    The Communityhave so far not committed themselves, even in principle, andI was slightly surprised to see in a recent telegramBrussels (No. 69 of 12th April) that Monsieur ley ha    told the Ministerial Council that the British approach to food aidwas not as generous as had been hoped,    it is at any rate more -generous than the community1s.There is a dispute between the Community and the Americanson whether coarse grain prices should or should or not be covered by the agreement.    The Americans have refused even toconsider this, while the Community say that it is essential.i-Ve can afford to look on, if coarse grain prices are not included we can deal with our own problems through bilateral agreement with our main suppliers.There is still a good leal of difficult negotiation to bedone before theoutlines cf a settlement emerge, but I should be surprised if the whole operation broke down through inability to reach a cereals agreement.Tropical ProductsWe have prepared an offer designed to appear of maximumhelp to the less developed countries as a whole, while doing the minimum harm to Commonwealth countries who have preferencesin our market.    Predictably, the Commonwealth countries are pressing us to withdraw from our offer all items of interestto them and if we did what they asked weshouid be left with some-thing extremely meagre.    There is likely to be a clash of priorities here between our -wish to help the LoD.Cs. as awhole and the maintenance of Commonwealth preferences in our market.    A seperate paper is being put to Ministers on this issue.The Developed CommonwealthAustralia has made offers to America and Japan which involve the reduction or elimination of about three-quarters of our trade preferences in Australia.In some cases Australia has proposed to raise the tariff against us, which we would regard as contrary both to the GATT and tothe Trade Agreements   Canada has made similar, thonghnot quite so brutal, offers to the United States and Japan.Both countries are out to make the best possible bargain for themselves and are quite prepared to sell our preferences forany concessions by third countries which bring them benefit.&apos;7e propose to take a similarly hard headed and realisticapproach in our own offers to third countries which affect our preferences in our market for the developed Commonwealth.NonrTariff BarriersOur troubles here are with the Americans.    In common withthe Community and the Swiss, we are pressing them to eliminateAmerican Selling Price.    We- are also pressing them to change the -wine gallon assessment, which damages our exports ofbottled whisky, and have offered to   remove Commonwealth-preference on unmanufactured tabacco.    The Americans- 3 -
have asked us to remove the &quot;ban on imports of coal and toincrease the quota of American television material used bythe British networks.     We cannot move on coal, and thedecision on television material rests with the broadcasting authorities who have for sound reasons refused to offer any concession.      The only possibility we have in this sectoris of some minor move on restrictions on imports of citrusproducts from the dollar area.      We are satisfied that sucha move would cause no economic disadvantage to the West Indies,but their views are based on emotion rather than reason.A separate submission is &quot;being made on this point.     I hopethat Ministers will&apos; agree that we can make some small offerin this field;    otherwise we have virtually no non-tariffbarrier currency.Future prospectsThe next immediate phase is likely to be one of muchsharper confrontation between the Community and the UnitedStates with Great Britain more on the sidelines;    they arethe principal parties concerned, and their essential con-flicts of interests have not yet come into the open,  sinceboth have so far been handling the business with kid gloves.This cannot continue much longer and we shall soon see the blood flow.Despite the problems still to be resolved I think thatthe negotiations will come to a conclusion early in May andthat this conclusion will generally be regarded as fulfillingthe original objectives of the Kennedy Round.      The reductions in tariffs will certainly,  if the negotiations are eventuallysuccessful, be the largest ever made in any such enterprise.At the moment the British team seems to be equallyunpopular with all the other principal negotiating countries.I regard this as evidence that we are pursuing a sufficientlyfirm line and holding a reasonable balance between all the conflicting interests.      We shall continue to do our best toobtain a satisfactory conclusion to the Round as a whole anda tolerable bargain for the United Kingdom.Apart from tropical products and citrus, we need no newinstructions for the present, but as the pace hots up we shallno doubt have to seek them on the most important issues as amatter of great urgency.      On matters of lesser importance weshall use our discretion to make the best settlement we can.R0 R0  POWELL14th April, 1967- k -CONFIDENTIAL
