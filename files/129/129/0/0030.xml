DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY rS G O V ER N ME NT)C(67) 80 COPY NO.22nd May, 1967CABINETNATIONALISATION OF THE PORTSMemorandum by the Minister of transport the proposals for nationalisation of the ports which are summarised in the Annex to this memorandum have been agreed by the Ministerial Committee on the Reorganisation of the Docks,2,       Without extensive and detailed discussions with the many-interests concerned, however, it is not possible to make further progress.    I am therefore anxious to open consultations with these interests and I accordingly seek my colleagues agreement to rnydoing so now on the basis of these proposals.3, When the consultations have been completed I will put specific recommendations to my colleagues.3. A. C,Ministry of Transport, S. E,l,22nd May, 1967
AnnexNationalisation of the PortsOrganisationt.     A National Ports Authority (NPA)  and Regional port authorities (RPAs)  should he established.    The NPA vrould haveoverall control and ultimate responsibility for the nationally-owned port transport industry on all matters.    Tne NPA&apos;s functions would comprise:-(a) Provision of efficient and economical port transport facilities and services in Great Britain, with such control as may he necessary over independent port facilities and services in their ports and incooperation with bodies providing inland and sea transport facilities.(b) (i)    Preparation of a comprehensive development plan for the nationalised port transport industry, and responsibility for relating port transport planning and investment to overall transport and economic planning (and consultation with persons directly concerned, including, in particular, the regional economic planning councils).(b) (ii)   Keeping under review port transport facilities and services not in national ownership, with power tosubmit recommendations as and where appropriate to theMinister for the transfer of any of these into nationalownership.(c) A financial duty so to exercise control over the RPAs asto secure that the revenues of the nationalised port transport industry are not less than sufficient to meet combinedcharges to revenue taking one year with another.(Financial objectives would be agreed between theMinister and the NPA).(d) Establishment, jointly with the appropriate unions, ofnational machinery, and ensuring the establishment of regional and local machinery for consultation and for negotiation of terms and conditions of employment andfor the promotion and encouragement of the safety,health and welfare of employees; and the arrangementsfor workers&apos; participation in management.(e) Preparation and presentation to the Minister of anannual report on the exercise and performance by them of their functions during the year and on their policyand programme.    (This would embrace the accounts ofthe NPA and of the individual RPAs).
2. Whilst the NPA must &quot;be in effective control of policy onsuch matters as finance, planning, investment, revenue targets,pricing, research, training and key appointments, the RPAs musthave a wide measure of autonomy. Their functions would be to manage their affairs efficiently in accordance with the broadpolicy of the NPA. They v/ould make proposals for development and investment to the NPA.3.     Under the NPA, the RPAs v/ould accordingly be vested withthe property, assets, rights and liabilities of the undertakingsincluded in the scheme of nationalisation; and they v/ould be theemployers of people in the industry within their&apos; regions.   TheRPA&apos;s functions would comprise:-(a) The efficient and economical management, maintenance and operation of their facilities and services andexercising control over independent facilities and services in their ports;(b) (i)    Preparation of and submission to the NPA of proposals for the development and improvement oftheir ports (after consultation in particular withregional economic planning councils) .(ii)   Keeping under review ports and port facilitiesnot in national ownership and submitting recommenda-tions as and where appropriate to the NPA for thetransfer of any of these into national ownership.(c) Establishment,  jointly with the appropriate unions,of regional and local machinery for consultation and negotiation, safety, health, welfare;  and workers&apos;participation.(d) The preparation of annual reports and accounts andsubmission to the NPA.A.     In discharging these functions the RPAs would be accountable to the NPA and be required to comply with directions, general orspecific, given from time to time by the NPA.   The Minister ofTransport, after consultation with or on the representation of theNPA,    would have power to confer additional or different func-tions on the RPAs.5.     In order adequately to exercise their functions the NPAand RPAs v/ould be vested with appropriate powers.6.     Each RPA would decide how best to organise its ports.   Eachwould have to keep its separate accounts and make annual reports.Number of RPAs7.     There is no perfect solution to the question of the number and the boundaries of the RPAs.   It is important, so far aspossible, given the inevitable predominance of London and liverpool, to achieve a balance so that the smaller regions willnot be overshadowed by the larger.    The RPAs must also be of sufficient size and financial strength to be able to manage their affairs effectively,- adopt modern management techniques and provide adequate scope for investment and development.    It isconsidered that the following arrangement of RPAs meets these requirements reasonably well:/1.- 2 -
1 .      Scotland?2.     North-East (includes the Tyne, Wear, and Tees; andcovers the coast from the Scottish Border to thesouthern boundary of the North Riding) ;3.     Humber (from the boundary of the North Riding to gibraltar Point,  just south of the mouth of the Humber);k.     East Anglia (Gibraltar Point to Foulness Point) ;5.     Thames &amp; Medway (Foulness Point to North Foreland) ;6.     South (North Foreland to Devon/Somerset border);7.     hales and Severnside (Devon/Somerset border toBardsey Island) ;8.     North Vest (Bardsey Island to the Scottish Border).These 8 regions are  shown on the attached map.Constitution of NPA8.     Appointments would be made by the Minister of Transport on anon-representational basis.   The NPA would consist of 8 to 12members, of whom the majority would be full-time, appointed from among persons who have had wide experience of and shown capacity in transport, industrial, commercial or financial matters, in administration, applied science or the organisation of workers.Particular members of the NPA would take a special interest in suchtopics as finance, commercial policy, and personnel matters.    the chairmen of the RPAs would not sit on the NPA.Constitution of RPAs9.     Appointments to the RPAs would be made by the Minister afterconsultation with the Chairman of the NPA.   Members would be drawn from the sarnie fields of experience as the NPA members.    Therewould be 6 to 10 members, according to the size and character ofthe RPA; auid a majority would be full-time members.   Specificresponsibilities could be assumed by individual members.^Notes-   The question of direct dock union representation onthe NPA and RPAs is referred to in paragraph 18 below/,The Ports10.   Only the larger and more significant ports would be includedin the initial nationalisation scheme.   There would be brought intonational ownership on a date prescribed under the legislation the undertakings of statutory harbour authorities:-(a) where the foreign trade exceeds 100,000 tons a year or(b) at which 2 3 or more workers registered under the Nationalhock Labour Scheme (N.D.L.S.) are employed.    In addition,any other harbours vested in the British Transport DocksBoard (B.T.D.B.) would be transferred.   These under-takings are listed in the Appendix 1 and shown on theattached Map.ii - 3 -
11,    &quot;Single-user&quot; ports (i.e. any port the use of which is wholly or predominantly confined to goods used in, or manufacturedor produced in, the industrial processes of the owner of the port)would not be included in the nationalisation scheme, eitherinitially or ^subsequently.   Fishery harbours, and marine works in Scotland,&apos;  would similarly be excluded.    Harbours owned bythe British Railways Board or by the. British Waterways board will also be excluded where, as is mostly the case, the harbour isan integral element in the railways or waterways system.Nnn-S tat ut ory undertook akings12.   Within the harbours to be included in the nationalisationscheme are a large number of undertakings, not in the ownership of the harbour authorities, either owning wharves, quay andjetties or carrying out harbour operations, chiefly cargohandling; and some do both.   Until comprehensive information hasbeen obtained, as part of the consultation process, about these undertakings it is not possible to make specific proposals(except as to lighterage and towage, see paragraph 13 below).Care must be taken, for example, not to impose unnecessaryliabilities on the RPAs by transferring to them undertakings theydo not require to perform their functions.    The consultations andthe review of the undertakings would proceed on the basis thatthe object would be to include in nationalisation those assets and operations that serve the generality of shipowners andshippers.Lighterage and Towage13.   A considerable part of lighterage and towage work is eithernot directly connected with port operations serving the generality of shippers and shipowners or is concerned with inlandwaterway transport or seagoing and salvage operations.   Lighterageand towage undertakings, other than those already owned by the harbour authorities, would, therefore, not be included in the initial nationalisation scheme.   But the RPAs would be chargedwith the duty of reviewing lighterage and towage arrangements and requirements and be empowered to propose the take-over of  -lighterage and towage assets so far as required for the efficiency of their ports.Further powers of take-over1h.    It is proposed that each RPA would have a duty to reviewnon-nationalised ports or port facilities in its region.   RPAswould be able to submit schemes through the NPA to the Ministerof Transport for taking over such ports and facilities with a viewto securing the improvement, maintenance or management of a port,or of the region&apos;s ports, in an efficient and economical manner.Persons affected would have a right to object to the proposals;and a statutory procedure for consideration of the objections,including provision for a public inquiry, would be prescribed.s Note:-   &quot;Fishery harbours&quot; and &quot;marine works&quot;  are defined inAppendix 2.- k -
15. The RPAs would have power to acquire any such port or portfacility by agreement -without specific Ministerial consent.16.   These proposals would have the added advantage of enabling the RPAs to propose the take-over of any particular port whichfalls outside the defined classes which will have to be set outin the Bill if the procedure for hybrid Bills is to be avoided.Worker ^participation17.   The NPA and RPA would be required to consult with the unionswith the view to establishing and maintaining machinery for negotiation and regular consultation and discussion at all levels.But in addition - and we are committed to this by our election manifesto - we must make provision for joint participation.The development of thinking on the subject of worker participationgenerally underlines the view that this is essentially a matter for an industry to work out itself.   The ports nationalisationlegislation should, therefore, give., sufficient flexibility - and encouragement - for management and unions at all appropriatelevels to get together and agree on what arrangements should bemade.   Between now and the nationalisation vesting date in 1970there will be continuing debate on the subject and increasingexperiment and experience of methods of worker participation.The legislation should, therefore, be drafted so as to permit theindustry to apply the lessons learned.18.   In the consultations about the nationalisation scheme it isproposed to indicate (without commitment)  the followingpossibilities, which are not,,of course, mutually exclusive:-(i)    There should be an obligation to include in themachinery for joint consultation arrangements agreed withthe unions for associating workers representatives withthe management of day-to-day operations at dock level, theworkers&apos;  representatives to have regular access to routinemanagement information (except on matters within the scopeof collective bargaining) and the opportunity of offeringadvice at the formative stages of more important managementdecisions.    Matters within the scope of collective bargaining to bedealt with through separate machinery or negotiation.    the agreed arrangements for associating workers with management to be subject to Ministerial approval and, in the event of failure to agree or to obtain Ministerial approval,provision to be made for suitable arrangements to beestablished by Ministerial direction.(ii)    Really effective consultative committees, such committees having direct access to the NPA and RPAs.(iii)    Committees consisting of NPA and union representativeswhich would exercise joint control broadly on the lines ofthat exercised in the past in relation to matters previouslydealt with under the Dock Labour Scheme;  and a similar arrangement at RPA level.(iv) The inclusion of a trade union element on the NPA and/or RPAs on a non-representational basis and not necessarilyfrom the port workers unions.(v)    Some form of representation of port workers on the NPAand/or RPAs,,- 5/The
The Future of. Dock Labour Boards19.   After decasualisation has been introduced under the revisedDock Labour Scheme the Dock Labour Boards (DLBs) will haveresponsibilities for temporary transfers of registered dockworkers from one  employer to another, the control of theRegister (recruitment, retirement, redundancy) 5 discipline,provision of training, and welfare and amenities.    Thearrangements for the carrying out of these functions afternationalisation will depend on the arrangements for workersparticipation within the nationalised sector and the relative size of the residual private sector.   As explained in paragraph 12above, until our consultations have been completed we cannot besure that the initial take over will not leave a substantialsegment of the industry (employing registered dock workers) in private hands.The non-nationalised -ports20.    So long as a port remains outside the nationalised sector thepresent arrangements for control of such mutters as major invest-ment by the Minister of Transport should continue.    The NPA, whowould be in competition with these ports, would not advise theMinister on such matters.Prices21.   Users at present have a right to object to the National PortsCouncil about port dues, and to the courts about other chargesby port authorities (such other charges have to be -reasonable&quot;).The Governments general policies on justification and examinationof prices should provide adequate protection for users.    Moreover,the proposed user consultative machinery (see following paragraph)could be made into an adequate forum for considering complaints on prices in the nationalised sector.Machinery for User Consultation.22.   User consultative machinery would be set up on the lines ofthat in other nationalisation statutes.   This machinery would beof particular importance in that it would have to replace thepresent representation that users have on many port authorities as well as provide protection on dues and charges.Pilotage23.   Consultations are in hand with the parties concerned aboutimprovements to the present pilotage arrangements.    specific recommendations will be made when these consultations have beencompleted..Q,QJSn^ASa.ti on,,f or Under takings Nati onalised.2h.   Work is in progress on this subject.    Officials will at theappropriate time be making a separate report to the first secretary of State, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Transport.- 6 -
