FOREWORDThis booklet is designed to provide the public witha summary of the essential facts concerning the european economic Community and policies with, where necessary,reference to present United Kingdom arrangements and policiIt is not intended to set out the implications for the UKof membership of the EEO or to discuss the possible advantages and disadvantages.    The information providedhere should, however,  clarify for many people the historyof European co-operation since Wdrld War 2, what the EECis and how it works, and the present state of the Europeaneconomies as a background to the present considerationbeing given by the UK Government to their policy towardsEurope.
Chapter Iie ruiicrvj; co-op:: ratiohThe peoples of Europe have for centuries shared elements&apos;ofa common culture which has stirvived the growth of independentmarked in the arts and in the development of intellectual ideas,from early times Europeans have co-operated economically.    Tradeflourished naturally within a small continent containing a wide variety of natural resources and human talents.    The realisation of common interests always outlived the most hitter nationalrivalries and wars,Prom time to time,  a concept of European unity has emerged.Since 19k-5, that concept has grown stronger.    Several factorshave contributed to the strengthening of the European idea.    Twoworld wars severely weakened the European economy.    The UnitedStates and the Soviet Union have each become extrenely powerful -far stronger than any western European country.   another important factor has been the rapid development of technology.To operate to full efficiency, modern&apos; industry requires largeproduction units and assured markets larger than any singleEuropean country.    In co-operation with other countries britain has taken a leading part in efforts to bring European countriescloser together.Immediately after the second world war, several emergencyorganisations were set up to solve vast social and economic problems in Europe caused by the war and by the breakdown of thenormal pattern of life.    The United States took a prominent partin most of these organisations.    In 19h7, the more permanentaspects of economic co-operation were consolidated into a singleUnited Nations body, the Economic Commission, for JEurppe, (E&apos;.:C,E, )In.l9h7, General Marshall,  then United States Secretary ofnational states.The sense of a common identity has been most/State,
State, suggested that helped by massive American aid the european countries should jointly plan and operate a more permanent programmeof recovery and development.     Britain-and Prance responded byinviting to a conference all European countries except Spain.Communist countries of eastern Europe declined to participate, buttiost other European governments sent representatives.     As a resultof the conference the Orj^nisal^ion^ Ecjonqmic;Co-operation J^OEECO. was set up.     Most western European countriesbecame members and Canada and the United States joined asassociate members.The OEEC urgently set about its task.     From 1948 to 1951,passive American aid was channelled to Europe through the OEEC aspart of the Marshall Plan.     The OEEC induced member states to lower trade barriers.     A European Payments Union (EPU), set upin 1950., promoted trade by reducing difficulties of paymentsbetween countries.      The European Monetary Agreement (EKA), whichreplaced EPU in 1958,  includes most non-communist countries ofEurope.The OEEC achieved some co-ordination of economic and financialpolicies, and allocated raw materials in short supply.      It gavetechnical assistance to industry and agriculture, and sponsoredresearch and training schemes.      It assessed long-term energyrequirements and promoted the development of nuclear energy forpeaceful purposes.     The OEEC ended in 1961, by which time its maintask of reconstruction was completed.     A new body, the of^anisatiqn S .ji 2S2.pAc.. PPrJQPAy^ti.0!1- AhA P.e-Ye.lQjfflejYk (OECD) , replaced it.The 0ECD&apos;s main task is to co-ordinate the economic, financial,trade, development, and related polioies of member countries.Its main objectives are to promote maximum economic growth, to expand trade on a multilateral basis, and to increase the flow of aid to developing countries./Canada
Canada and the United States became full members of OECD.    Japanjoined in 196b,..Concurrent with the drive for e economic co-operation cameseveral moves towards political co-operation.    In 19^8, Belgium,the Netherlands,  and Luxembourg, which had entered into a customs union called Benelux,   joined Britain and Prance in signing theBrusseIs. ILreaty - a pact for mutual assistance and defence.    In1949, the Brussels Treaty powers joined with Canada, Denmark,Iceland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, and the United States, to formthe Norjth.Az]^^c^rQat^^ e^^^igri (NATO).    By enteringNATO Canada and the United States identified their own securitywith that of western Europe.    Greece and Turkey he came fullmembers of NATO in 1952.In 19k9, &quot;the five original Brussels Treaty powers joinedwith the Irish Republic, Italy,  and the three Scandinaviankingdoms to found the Council of Europe.    Eight other countriesbecame full members later.    Greece and Turkey (I9k9),  Iceland(1950), the Federal Republic of Germany (1951), Austria (1956),Cyprus (1961),  Switzerland (1963),  and Malta (1965).    The purposeof the Council is &quot;to achieve a greater unity between its members for the purpose of safeguarding and realising the ideals and principles which are their common heritage,  and facilitatingtheir economic end social progress&quot;.    Defence matters do not come within the scope of the Council.-   The Council has a Committee^ pi&quot;.....Ministers representing thegovernments of member countries.    It also has a Consultative^ssembl^ of I/+7 representatives of national parliaments.    Itresembles a national parliament in form and procedure, but cannot pass laws.    Through the Council,  several international conventions have been agreed on matters that include human rights,Patents, and extradition./Chapter 2.Ch1 . 3
Chapter 2The imperative need for European countries to help eachother to recover from the effects of the war rapidly diminished&quot;bitterness and suspicion between countries that had been enemies,,In particular. Prance and the Federal Republic of Germany movedtowards a new basis of friendship.Wider co-operation between six countriesIn 1950, M. Robert Schuman, then French Foreign Minister, putforward a plan to rationalise the coal and steel industries of western Europe.    Outside Britain, Europe&apos;s main coal, iron, andsteel resources and industries are concentrated in the north-western corner of Europe, where the frontiers of Belgium, France,Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands almost converge.    M. Schumanproposed that the industries should be reorganised into one vastproduction group unhindered by national boundaries.    Beyond theeconomic implications of the plan lay the hope that integration ofFrench and German, industries would make war between the twocountries not only unlikely, but physically impossible.    M. SchumanTsplan led to a treaty in 1951 between the Benelux countries, France,the Federal Republic of Germany, and Italy, which in 1952 established the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC).    The ECSC was provided with an executive - the High Authority - completelyindependent of national governments in the performance of its functions and duties&apos;.    In 195h, Britain and the ECSC set up a^^SSil-Pf association^ion through which they could consult each otheron coal and steel policies.ECSC quickly proved successful.    For example, between 1952 and1955 steel production rose from 1+2 to 53 million metric tons.    Anidea emerged in the six ECSC countries that co-operation might&quot;be extended to the point of integration of their military forces.This would go far beyond the NATO arrangement, which was/basically,
basically an alliance of independent national forces.    It would bring the forces of the Federal Republic of Germany (then still -outsideNATO) into the western defence force.    A treaty was signed by allsix ECSC countries to establish a European Defence Community (EDO) .But in 195U the French parliament    arlerf &quot;to ratify the treaty and the EDC plan collapsed.The Federal Republic of Germany and Italy then   joined theorganisati on3russels Treaty/which in 1955 was extended into a new associationcalled Wgstern European Union (WEU).    The scope of WEU includespolitical and economic affairs, apart from defence matters.    In1955, the Federal Republic of Germany joined NATO.The b:-,ci.p of the. Cor^pn haricot&apos;The success of ECSC encouraged the six member countries(called &apos; the Six&apos;) to explore ways of extending economic co-operation between themselves.    In 1955, the foreign ministers of the Six met at Messina, in Sicily, and agreed in principle toco-operate in developing nuclear energy and to move towardsachieving a common market within which much of the resources andeconomic activities of their countries would be co-ordinated andgradually integrated.    After nearly two years of negotiation and consideration, agreement was reached.    The Six signed the Treatyof Rome on 25th March 1957, and the EuropeanJEcp nomic Community(e.c.) - known as the Common Jjajdoet began to operate on1st January 1958.ilnother treaty, also signed in Rome on 25th March 1957,provided for the co-ordination of nuclear research and powerProjects of e.c. countries through the European Atomic EnergyCommunity (Euratom) .    The Euratom treaty came into effectsimultaneously with the Common Market.By establishing the e.c., the Six hoped to speed economicand social progress through the closer union of their peoples./They
They planned to eliminate step by step, barriers to trade between themselves.    They proposed that each e.c. country should eventually enforce identical tariffs -on imports from countries outside the Six.    Beyond this they announced that they favouredreducing barriers to international trade generally.The e.c. governments began to abolish by stages restrictionson the movement of people, capital, and goods within theCommunity.   Within the framework of their far-reachingcc-operation, the Six sought to promote fair business competition between firms within the Community.    They undertook to controlrestrictive practices and monopolies in each country and agreedthat state aid to industry which distorted competition would be incompatible with the Common Market.In 19585 Belgium, Prance, and the Netherlands stillpossessed large overseas territories.    The e.c. set up a EuropeanDevelopment Fund for Overseas (EDF) , through which more than 200 million of aid reached 18 territories in Africa between 1958and 1963.    After the African territories became independent theyentered into associate membership with the e.c..    Other countrieslater sought association, including several Commonwealth countries(see Chapter 3).    The e.c. undertook to provide between 196h and1969,  260 million for development in the African countries, and 25 millions in aid for overseas territories and departments ofEEC countries.Advantages to the SixThe combined population of the e.c. countries (now about180 million) almost equalled the population of the United States.The Six reasoned that great benefits would accrue from having asingle market of such great size./For
For example, they thought that efficient firms would he likelyto expand their activities within the Community, and would deploytheir resources more efficiently.    They would tend to concentratetheir production units in the most economically suitable areas ofthe Community.   Firms would tend to specialise, producing larger quantities of a smaller range of goods and benefitting from increased economies of scale.    These developments would eventuallylower costs and prices.Put briefly, the governments of the Six believed that if the eec went forward,  a more efficient patterm of production would emerge,with each region and each firm doing the jobs for which they werebest equipped.    They believed that production costs would diminish,and that providing fair competition was maintained, prices wouldbe kept low.    This would bring an improvement in the standard ofliving throughout the Community.Effects on other countries the setting up of the e.c. was bound to have a considerable effect upon countries outside the Community.    Tariff changes, forexample, would be likely to affect the pattern of trade, and some countries might suffer as a result.    The Six argued that the EECwould benefit the world generally.    As prosperity grew, the eec countries could provide cheaper goods to the world and becomebetter customers.    They could provide more aid and investment funds for developing countries.The Treaty of Rome stated that by establishing a customs union,the member states aimed at contributing to the harmonious develop-ment of world trades the progressive abolition of restrictions on international trade, and the lowering of customs harriers.    For theroost part, the Cjgjmrion External Tariff (see Chapter h) as originallyconstructed, was based on an average of the previously existingBenelux, French, west German, and Italian tariffs./Several
Several OEEC countries outside the Six feared that thedevelopment of the e.c. would increase political as well as economicdisunity in Europe.    Prom July 1957? they sought to find ways of extending co-operation between the proposed e.c. and other OEECcountries, including the setting up of free trade area.Negotiations with this aim continued after the e.c. was established,but ended in failure in November 1 958.EFTAIn 1959,  seven 0EPC countries outside the e.c. - Austria,Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UnitedKingdom - met together and formed the European Free trade association (EFTA) which began to operate in 1960,    FinlandT^csrne an associate member of EFTA in 1961.    The EFTA countries,whose combined population totals nearly 100 million, sought toestablish an    industrial free trade area among themselves.    Likethe e.c., they agreed to work for the removal of trade barriersbetween all OEEC countries.The first tariff reductions between EFTA countries were madeon 1st July 1960.    The EFTA countries agreed to eliminate all restrictions on free trade in industrial products between themselvesin ten years.    EFTA, in common with the e.c., originally aimed atthe abolition of tariffs between member states by the end of 1969.In fact, the original EFTA countries largely achieved free tradein industrial products in six and a half years, almost allindustrial tariffs ending on 31st December 1966.    Unlike the e.c.,EFT A did not set up a uniform tariff against imports from n on-EFTA.countries.    Each member country retained its own external tariffsystem.Bsl ajLn&apos; s approach ,t o the SixEPTA countries emphasized that they wished to avoid extending the split in Europe.    The view gained ground and a new approach/to the
to the Six was required.    In the summer of 1961, Britain leadersdiscussed with EFTA the Commonwealth leaders, the implications of possible British membership of the EEF.    In August 1961,the British Government made a formal application and negotiationsbegan in October about the terms of admission.    The then Lord privy seal emphasised that the interests of British agriculture, of theCommonwealth, and of EFTA, must be safeguarded.    In March 1962,Britain also applied to join ECSC and Euratom,Talks continued for fifteen months, but in January 1963, theFrench delegates requested that negotiations with Britain shouldbe suspended.    Talks broke off on 29th January 1963.Britain gnd^the Common MarketBritain&apos;s trade with Europe has increased rapidly during theyy&quot;, &apos;; .:.11 y y, .,   , , .&apos; -y /y. yy 1     - v        . ..!;, : /y ; y v    ,r-j:. *yy.past ten years.    Up to 196U, our trade with the e.c. grew faster than our trade with EFTA but since then the trend has beenreversed.During the ten-year period the economic division of Europebecame more marked.    The e.c. lowered its internal tariffs whilemoving towards its common external tariff.    EFTA abolished nearly all its internal tariffs.    The ending of the economic divisionof Europe remained one of the main aims of EFTA..The British Government&apos;s position with regard to Europe was expressed in the following passage in the Queen&apos;s speech to&apos;My Government will continue to promote the economic unity of Europeend to strengthen the links between the European Free trade association and the European Economic Community.    They would beready to enter the European Economic Community provided essentialBritish and Commonwealth interests were safeguarded.&apos;Parliament in April 1966;/In
In Parliament on 10th November 1966s the Prime Ministerreaffirmed the Government&apos;s policy towards the ESC. He saidthat:&apos;the Government would he prepared to accept the Treaty of Rome,subject to the necessary adjustments consequent upon the accession of a new member and provided that we receivedsatisfaction on the points about which we see difficulty.&apos;Britain belongs to several organisations for technologicalco-operation in Europe, including the Euj?ojpean Nuclear EnergyAgency (ENEA), the European Launcher Development Organisation(ELDO) s and the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO).    Inthese organisations Britain is already an active partner of the eec countries.    On 1hth November 1966, the Prime Minister made clear our desire !to pool within Europe the enormous technologicalinventiveness of Britain and other European countries&apos;   (see chapter 6).On 5th December 1966, Heads of Government or senior ministers from all efta countries met in London to discuss economic integration in Europe.    The ministers welcomed proposals by theBritish Prime Minister and his Foreign Secretary to visit allEEC countries for talks to determine whether&apos;&apos; or net conditionsexisted in which fruitful negotiations for British membership ofthe Community might take place.    Talks were held in the sixcapitals between 16th January and 8th of March 1967.
Chapter how THE COHjUMITIES.....WORKThis chapter outlines the aims of the three european communities set up by the Six - e.c., ECSC and Euratom;    how theyhave set out to achieve their aims;    and the progress so far.MEMBERSHIP.OF THE EECThe Treaty provides that any European state may apply tojoin.   The Governments of all members must agree before a new member is admitted, and acceptance has to be ratified by all the parliaments.    The Community may also conclude association arrange-ments with any country, union of states or international organis-ation.    It is contemplated that any European country, or union of states, may seek association with the Community in a form ranging from something approaching membership to a very limitedrelationship.Since the Treaty was signed, Greece has concludedan association agreement which is intended to lead to eventualmembership, and Turkey has entered into a more limited formof association but also sees full membership as her long-term objective.    Talks about association are in progress withAlgeria, Morocco and Tunisia, with Israel to succeed her present trade agreement, and with Austria.    Spain has applied for association.Trade agreements have been made with Iran, Israel and LebanonOverseas association of African and other&quot;&apos;&quot;bverseas&quot; countries with the e.c. is described on page 17 of this chapter and inthe next chapter.MANAGEMENT OF THE EECInstitutions were set up to elaborate and implement the intentions of the Treaty.    Control of the e.c. involves more thannational governments co-operating, but, at the same time, the institutions are not a &quot;federal government&quot; to which national/governments
governments are subordinate.The main, Z.;C institutions are described below and theirrelationships are set out in the chart on page 6 of&apos; this chapter.   Thecentral institutions in the formation and conduct of Cormmnityaffairs are the Council jpf j.Iinisters arid the Oocfflission.The Qoiuicil of ]liiiistejrs.  The Council consists of one hinisterfrom each member state.   Different Ministers can&apos;attend accord-ins to the subject under discussion.    The Council makes basicdecisions and ensures the co-ordination of the general economic policies of the member states.    Decisions in the Council are reached by a simple majority or by a qualified majority or byunanimity according to the provision, of the Treaty about theparticular topic.    In practice,, in a large number of cases wherethe Council enacts regulations or issues directives it must doso by unanimity or by a qualified majority.    &quot;here a qualifiedmajority is required, the votes of the Council members areweighted as follows:    four votes each for Prance, Germany andItaly, two ea.ch for Belgium and the Netherlands and one forLuxembourg.    A minimum of 12 out of the 17 votes is needed fora qualified majority decision but where the Treaty requiresrequire decisions to be taken on a proposal by the Commission,the 12 votes must include at least four member states.    proposals from the Commission can be amended only by a unanimous vote.On 1st Jajauary 1966, the JSC moved into the third and last of the transitional stages.    a consequence ofthis was that matters hitherto decided by unanimity &apos;in  the Council of Ministers were now to he decided by a qualified-majority.    This change in/voting
d 0 4voting procedure was however, accompanied by-differences of opinion among the Six.    As a. resultof their meeting at Luxembourg in January 1966 they agreed that when, in the case of decisions which naybe taken by majority vote on a proposal of theCommission, very important Interests, of one or moreUeijiber States were in question, members of the council are to endeavour to reach within a reasonable periodsolutions which could be adopted unanimously.    TheFrench delegation considered that when, very importantinterests were in issue, discussion should continue until unanimous agreement was reached but this was not accepted by the other countries, and it was simplynoted that there was a. difference of opinion withinthe Six on what happened when a complete resolution of the divergent views was not achieved.The^ C Qjmaission   The Commission has nine members each appointed for four years by common agreement among the six governments.There can be no more than two from any one country,   members have to act in the general interest of the SAC with complete independence of any particular country.    The Commissionformulates proposals for the Council but also has certain powers of decision.The Commission and its staff constitute the executiveinstitution of the Community, responsible for its day-to-day-management.    For this purpose, they dispose of considerablePowers under the Treaty compared with those exercised by theexecutives of national administrations.

Box:- BASIC AIHSOF BBCThe founders of the Community stated in the preamble to the Treaty their determination toestablish the foundations of an even closer unionamong European peoples.   Within this framework,the aim of the Community is described as the har-monious development of the economies of member states by establishing a common market and progress-ively approximating their economic policies.    the objectives go well beyond the formation of a customs union and provide for:&quot;   Removal of all barriers to trade between member states.* Common customs tariff and common commercial policy towards third countries.:-   A common agricultural policy.Free movement of persons, services and capital between member states. : -* A common transport policy.;:   Co-ordinated economic policies,:;:   Rules against unfair competition.:;:    Co-ordinated social policies.:;:   Association of overseas territories in theinterests of trade and to assist their economic and social development.
THE BASIC AIMS OF EECThe basic aims of e.c. are summarised in the box above.   The free movementofjgods, the common jsxtejjial l^ariff, and the cpmnon^ayioultural policy are dealt with in the next two chapters, Tariffs and ji^ri^cultural^Systems.   TheTreaty provisions on the others and the progress made in each case are outlinedbelow.Trans ition. J^eri ojdsA feature of the way the e.c. is being developed is the use of transitionperiods for stage by stage movement from national systems in particular fieldsto full functioning of a Community system.   For example, the Treaty laid down that the customs union should be established during a transition period,divided into three stages each lasting four years, and it laid down thendnimuai advance to make at each stage towards the abolition of tariffs on trade between member states and towards establishment of the common external tariff.Subsequently the Six agreed on several accelerations and both will be completed by 1st July, 1968, eighteen months ahead of the final deadline laid down bythe Treaty.Free movement of labour the Treaty provides for free movement of labour within the Community not later than the end of the transitional period (L.e. by 1970).   This will, mean that people can move freely with their families from one member state to another totake jobs subject to limitation justified by reason of public order, public safety and public health.   They will have the right to transfer all their social security benefits (s*e Ch 3 p.16) and to settle permanently with.their families.The Community is moving towards the free movement of labour by stagesregulated by the Council under the Treaty.   At first member states could give priority to their own nationals in filling vacancies, but this wasgiven up in 1964.   Member states can still impose a priority for two weeksfor particular occupations or regions where there is a surplus of labourbut they have rarely done so recently.   Workers from any member country are given priority over those coming from countries outside the Community.0Member states have not experienced any disturbances or difficultiesunder these rules up to the present.The Council is at present considering proposals for freer movement.These provide for complete equality between workers from within the EEC____-....... ______ A&quot;vThe e.c. hps uroved attractive to workers from outside the Six - of some 950,000work permits issued to &quot;migrant workers in 1965 some two-thirds wore, for workers from outside.   Tho majority of the remainder wore issued to Italians,mostly for work in &quot;\7ost Germany.Und France.   Tho unemployment level in the eec in tho latter part ef was about the same as, or lower than, the levelm Britain, except in Italy (see Chapter 6).    Italy does not recruit workers from outside the e.c..
in the filling of vacancies anywhere in the Comniunitj&apos;-.   There is to be amore extensive exchange of information between the employment services of member states, and improved machinery to ensure that applications for jobsfrom workers from other member states are submitted to employers beforeapplications from outside the Community are considered,   All migrant workers from within the AEC will be entitled to equality of treatment with nationalworkers in relation to tax and social insurance, housing and membership oftrade unions and works councils.If these proposals are adopted member states will have to admit anyworko r from within the e.c. who comes to their country for the purposeof taking a job.   The proposals provide, however, that if a member stateexperiences or expects serious employment difficulties in a particular area or occupation it will be able to notify the Commission and if theCommission agrees that there is a risk of difficulties all member states will co-operate to discourage workers from moving to the affected areasor occupations.Free movement of services during the transitional period limits on the freedom of nationals andundertakings of one state to set up business and professional activities in another are to be progressively abolished.   This will include any restrictionson the reation of agencies, branches or subsidiaries.The rate of advance towards freedom of establishment and freedom to supply services is now considered satisfactory by the Commission,although the Community has not kept up with the timetable laid downin 1961.Free moyement^of capitalDuring the transitional period members are required to abolishprogressively restrictions on the movement of capital by residents of common market countries *
The provisions of the Treaty relating tomovements of capital have been reinforced by CouncilDirectives of May 1960   and December 1962 which havebeen accepted by member states.    The Commissionrecently laid an amended version of a further draftdirective before the Council, with the object of effecting further relaxation of exchange and other restrictions on capital movements&apos;.Thus, a good deal of progress has already beenmade in the freeing of capital movements betweenCommunity countries, in particular on the reductionof exchange control barriers to inward and outwardinvestment.   But some exchange control restrictionsremain, and it is with the object of securing some modification of these, and of other legislative andadministrative barriers to free capital movement,that the Third Draft Directive has been prepared bythe Commission.A cpmmon,r. tjrana pprt policy by the terms of the Treaty a common policy towards trans-port is to be adopted and followed by all members.Little formal progress has been made towards a common transport policy.   Agreement in broadprinciple was reached by the Council of ministers in June 1965 on a phased programme of a compromisekind, for bringing the transport systems of the Sixinto line, and the Commission has since submitted proposals to the Council.
Co^ordljaated^economic policies the Treaty requires member states to consider their economic policies as a matter of common interest.    It commitseach state to pursue a policy necessary to ensure equilibriumof its overall balance of payments and to maintain confidence in its currency, while ensuring a high level of employment and stable prices.    To achieve this end member states are toco-ordinate their economic policies and evolve a commoncommercial policy.   The Treaty requires the member states andthe Commission to consult with each other on economic and commercial matters.Various joint committees have boon establishedincluding ones reviewing the monetary situation and national budgets,  and one of Central Bank Governors.The Finance Ministers of the Six hold regular meetings,at which the Chairmen of the Monetary Committee andthe Short-Term Economic Policy Committee attend.The Short-Term Economic Policy Committee eachyear examines the economic situation of member statesand of the Community as a whole.    It was associatedclosely with the drafting of recommendations that theCouncil lias made in recent years to member states on measures to be taken to maintain the* Community&apos;internal and external economic balance.The Medium-Term Economic Policy Committee prepared a draft programme on medium-term economic policies as abasis for the co-ordination of economic policies to be pursued by member states and Community institutions overthe period 1966-1970.    This programme was discussed inthe Community and was adopted by the Council in February,1967.    The programme does not lay down quantitative targets for member states, but sets out initial guide lines for various fields of economic policy,  and deals in greater detail with such subjects as employment and vocational training policy, public finance and regional/policy

Early this year the Counciladopted two directives,  concerningthe adoption of a common system of ,;value-added&quot; taxation on company sales.       The common system will mean someamendment of the present French system of value-addedtaxation and will replace the &quot;cumulative turnover&quot;taxes at present in force in the other member states.The common system is due to come into force byJanuary 1970 at the latest.      There are no plans yet forharmonisation of rates of tax.      Taxation of services isonly compulsory when they have a marked effect on theprice of goods.     The objective of tax harmonisation is toprevent distortion of trade within the e.c..
C o mm on go pmme r c i al^ policyAji aim of the Treaty is the estahlishment of acommon commercial policy towards third countries.    The Treatyprescribes that.-after 1970 commercial policy shall be basedon uniformly established principles.   During the transitional period, member states are to. -:co-ordinate their commercial relations with thirds-countries. -Tariff negotiations are conducted by the Commissionin accordance with mandates from the Council of Ministers.(In the Kennedy Round,  the Commission is negotiating inthe cereals arrangement on behalf of the Community).As explained      in   the   next   Clrapter,  Communitycommercial relations with some countries are governed byassociation and trade agreements.Slow progress has been made with a common commercial policy.    The Commission has submitted to the Council pro-posals for Community policies on export aids, defence oftrade, relations with state trading countries and with japan, hut so far no decisions have been made.Member states still retain the right to imposequantitative restrictions on trade with third countries and to conclude bilateral trade agreements with them.Suj-j3.?.&apos; AP^f epiriletition.The Treaty prohibits all agreements and concerted prac-tices which are liable to affect trade between member statesand have as their object or result the prevention, restrictionor distortion of competition in the Common Market.    But,  subjectto certain conditions, the Treaty exempts from this prohibition,/agreements
agreements or practices which benefit production or distri-bution or promote progress.    The Treaty also prohibits anyimproper exploitation of a dominant position within theCommon Market.State^ aids are dealt with below.In 1962, the Council approved a Regulation whichprescribed a machinery of enforcement.    Firms have toapply to the Commission for &quot;negative clearance&quot; i.e.a finding that the particular arrangements to which theyare party do not conflict \with  the prohibitions in theTreaty.    The Court of Justice has ultimate jurisdictionon the application of the Treaty to a particular agree-ment.    So far, the Commission has announced decisions on or referred to the Court a limited number of cases.So far no enforcement action has yet been taken inrespect of monopolies.State&apos; aid,with the exception of aids of a social character Id iidividiials or thosewhich make good the damage caused by national disasters;,  any state aid which distorts competition in trade between member states is incompatible with the Common Market.    But aids to regional development, or to promote an important Europeanproject or to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy ofa member state or which facilitate development of certainactivities or of certain economic regions, providing there isno detriment to the common interest, may be deemed to be compatible with the Common Market.    All aids existing or pro-posed are subject to scrutiny  by the Commission.If a state does not comply with the Commission&apos;s decision, theCommission may refer the matter to the Court of Justice.    Butthe Council may, by unanimous, vote, override the Commission^decision./Regional
Re g ion al, pjpJLicies.One of the ohjectives of economic policy set out in theTreaty is the raising of the living standards of the less pros-prosperous areas of the Community.    State aids with this objective in view are allowed by the Treaty (see above),  and positivemeasures to help these.-areas are also taken by several Communitybodies.Regional problems, including those of areas dependenton declining industries and of isolated agricultural areas,are tackled in various ways by the member states.    In May1965 the Commission published a memorandum recommendingcertain measures to member states.Regional policies are mainly the responsibility of member states.    The e.c. instruments in this field are theEuropean Investment. Bank and the European, Social. Fund, thework of which is co-ordinated with the regional assistance given by the ECSC.By the end of 1966 the Europe an Iny eat me nt. Bank(see Ch 3 p. h-5)    had lent some  200 million within the six, nearly two-thirds of this to help finance development projects in Southern Italy,  and over  kO million in theEuropean associates - Turkey and Greece.The, Eurppe^an. Social ,Fund (see Ch 3. p.5)      beganoperation in 1961.    In its first five years of work it spentover  10 on re-training and about  1 million on re-employmentschemes.The Europe an (0oa;l ^and^Steel Comrnuni ty (See Ch 3.18 )gives loans to aid industrial and regional development in areas where employment in coal and steel has fallen; lastyear this was worth  6 million.    In addition its   direct/assistanceCh 3.15
Ch3. 16assistance to the workers affected, in the form oftiding-over and re-training allowances, is now running at an annual rate of over  3? million,Cc-crdinateol social p^olicie^s  -The member states agreed upon the need to promoteimprovement in the living and working conditions oflabour towards a common higher level.    The Treatyendorses the principle of equal pay.As explained in Chapter 6 the member states have each developed varied social security systems.Co-ordinated arrangements have been madefor social security for workers and their dependants moving from one member state toanother (see Ch.3? p8-9), but general har-monisation has not taken place.The Council agreed that equal pay shouldbe introduced by the end of 196h, and,although this objective has not been fully realised, substantial progress has beenmade.For the Suropean Social Fund, see Ch.3?p5 and 15.
Associatejl AoyersQ,as countries and territories the Treaty provides for the association of certain over-seas countries -with the Community, with a view to increasingtrade and to pursuing joint efforts towards economic and social development.    These are the countries and territories which, when the Treaty was signed, had a special relationship with. Belgium, France,  Italy or the Netherlands (for examplecolonies or ex-colonies).- -For trade arrangements with these associated countries and territories see next chapter.In 1963 an Association Convention (the YaoundeConvention) was signed to govern for 5 years from196A the relations &quot;between the BBC and 18 newlyindependent African states,  including Madagascar.    ThisConvention replaced transitional arrangements.   Jointinstitutions were set up by the Convention.   Arrangementsfor the remaining associated overseas countries and territories were laid down by the e.c. Council in their decision of 25th February 196A.    The terms of thisdecision are similar to those of the Yaounde Convention,except that thore are no joint institutions.The first Ejrrppe an. DeyeIopment Fund was replaced by a second one,  to which the Six agreed to contribute 260 million and the European Investment Bank  25 million.The fund is spent on aid to economic and social develop-ment in the 18 overseas associates which signed theConvention and the small dependent territories ofNetherlands and France,Nigeria signed a separate association agreement in1966.    (This has yet to be ratified).    It gives risingduty-free quotas to Nigerian peanut oil, palm oil, cocoabeans and plywood, and free entry to all other Nigerianproducts.    In return Nigeria is to grant preferences on26 products from the e.c..   Nigeria did not request andwill not receive development aid from the Community.Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania have had discussions with the eec about association.Ch3,  17
Ch.3. 18EUROPEAN^ COAL;, AND, STEEL. COMMuTTITYThe hasic aim of the Treaty of 1951 which set up theEuropean Coal and Steel Community was to establish a common market in coal and steel in the Six, with common objectives and institutions,  so as to ensure the rational development of these industries.    It has a High Authority, and a Council of ministers and it shares the European Parliament and the Court of Justicewith the e.c. and Euratom.    The High Authority&apos;s main powers areto supervise the operation of the common market for coal andsteel and particularly the conditions of competition,  and toencourage the co-ordination of investment.Common markets in coal,  iron and steel were established during 1953 and 195h, although some tariffs,subsidies and price controls continued for a transitional period which ended in February 1958.    The pricing rules of the Community have been applied.    These rules are designed to eliminate unfair competition and discriminationOn 21      December 195h,  an agreement was signed betweenthe UK, the High Authority and member governments of theECSC,establishing a Council of Association which provides a means for exchanging information,consultation and -where appropriate - co-ordination of action on matters of mutual interest relating to coal and steel.For ECSC aid to regional development and re-trainingpee Ch 3 p. 15-16.
E.URATO MThe Euratom Atomic Energy Community Treaty of 1957 setfor Euratom the aim of creating the conditions necessary forthe speedy establishment and growth of nuclear industries,including research, the construction of the necessary basicfacilities, the proper supply of ores and nuclear fuels9 and establishment of uniform health standards.The main institutions of Euratom are similar to those ofthe e.c. and ECSC.    In addition there are committees dealing withthe social, economic, technical and research aspects ofEuratom&apos;s functions and there is machinery for co-ordinationwith the e.c. and ECSC.Euratom is financed by contributions from member states inproportions set out in the Treaty.   Most nuclear research anddevelopment within the Community is undertaken by member states within national programmes.   However, the EuratomCommission in addition to its administrative and informationfunctions, undertakes research or development itself.Euratom1s research budget for the second five-year programme (1963-67) is about  160 million.    about one-fifth is for the Commission&apos;s main Research Centrein Italy.    Association contracts awarded by theCommission to national bodies stimulate and spreadinformation about developments thought to be of wideinterest in the Community.    Euratom also hascollaborative agreements with a number of countriesincluding the UK and the USA.A common market in nuclear material and equip-ment came into force on 1st January 1959;    and the/Euratom
Euratom Supply Agency was set up to ensure equalaccess to resources of nuclear material for fuelwithin the Community.Euratom is also concerned with plans for usingnuclear power to supply electricity:    nuclear power at present provides less than 1 per cent of the totalenergy supplies in the Community hut this proportionis expected to rise to rather more than one-tenth by1980 and to nearly a third by the end of the century.
Chapter .4 9%%TARIFFSCustoms duties are of two kinds.    revenue duties (which are paid also by similar home produced goods) and protective duties.The U K protective tariff has been considerably reduced inrecent years as a result of multilateral negotiations under theGeneral Agreement for Tariffs and Trade (G A T T) which seeks to reduce barriers to world trade.      It is hoped that the kennedy Round of trade negotiations, which Britain is stronglysupporting, will lead to a substantial reduction in tariffs and non-tariff barriers to world trade.      It is envisaged that mosttariff reductions would be phased over a period of 4 years,beginning in 1968.U K tariff levelslearly all raw materials and many basic food stuffs are free of import duty from all sources.     The main exceptions arewhere duties are charged on foreign products to give a margin ofpreference to Commonwealth suppliers.     Duties on somehorticultural products are varied during the course of the yearand are fixed at higher levels for the periods when the homecrop is marketed.      The rates of duties on semi-manufacturedgoods are mainly 15 per cent ad valorem or less;    while duties onmanufactured goods range from 10 per cent to 33 per centad valorem, or higher on a few items.The two diagrams below enable a comparison to be made between the levels of the U K most favoured nation tariff andthe Common External Tariff of the e.c. for industrial goods.Diagram 1 shows the proportion of tariff items in the U Ktariff and the GET falling within different duty hands.Diagram 2 shows the proportion of U K and e.c. imports in1961 within the various duty bands of the U K tariff and theGET.     Neither of these methods of comparing the two tariffs is/entirely
entirely satisfactory.     The first does not make allowance forthe greater fragmentation of the U K tariff which contains over ,800 separate items covering industrial goods,  compared withsome 2,400 in the GET.     On the other hand, the second methoddoes not take into account the deterrent effect on imports of high rates of duty,EJLIJLAs a result of the European Free Trade Association,protective duties have been removed from U K imports ofindustrial goods from Austria, Denmark, Finland? Morway,Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland.     Protective duties have alsobeen removed on imports from EFTA countries of someagricultural products of particular importance to E F T Asuppliers,Commonwealth PreferenceUp to 1932 the U K had very few import duties other thanthose imposed for revenue purposesj    and most of the dutiesthat did exist were applied at preferential rates,  or not atall, to Commonwealth goods.     When the general protective tariffwas introduced under the Import Duties Act, 1932 provision wasmade to exempt imports from the U K dependencies from theduties imposed under that Act.      Later that year the ottawa agreements Act gave effect to a series of commercial agreements with the Dominions, India, and Southern Pdiodeaia and extendedour duty-free entry commitments to those Commonwealth countries./TheseCh. 4,2
These agreements also provided for guaranteed margins ofpreference on certain goods.      The Import Duties Act,  1958maintained the Commonwealth Preference system by enablinggoods grown, produced or manufactured in the commonwealth preference Area to be exempted from import duty or to be madeliable to duty at preferential rates.     All commonwealth countries, together with South Africa, the Republic of IrelandBurma and Samoa are within the Area.Not all Commonwealth countries grant tariff preference toU K goods, but about half of our total exports to countrieswithin the Commonwealth Preference Area enjoy come measure ofpreference.Republic of ireland in addition to being eligible for Commonwealth preferencegoods originating in the Republic of Ireland are entitled to duty-free entry into this country under the U K/lrish Free trade agreement signed in December 1965.The^ Common MarketArticle 9 of the Treaty of Rome laid down that &quot;TheCommunity shall be based on a customs union covering theexchange of all goods and comprising both the prohibition,as between Member States, of customs duties on importationand exportation and all charges with equivalent effect andthe adoption of a common customs tariff in their relationswith third countries A&apos;The Treaty of Rome timetable laid down that the transitioifrom four separate customs zones (i.e. France,  Germany, Italy,Benelux) to a single Common Market should take place in three stages, to be completed by 1970.      The internal tariffs on industrial products traded between Member States have now been/reduced
reduced by four fifths, and on agricultural goods by about two thirds and the process is to be completed by July 1968,eighteen months earlier than originally planned.The Common External Tariff (C E T)Originally the majority of tariffs in the common external tariff represented the arithmetic average of the tariffs of the separate member states on 1 January 1957.       In general this meant a rise in German and Benelux tariffs and a fall in those of france  and Italy.     Some countries are allowed a &quot;duty quota;i on some goods - that is a quota that is allowed to enter at a tariff rate other than the normal rate.    The Six have made twoof the three projected moves by which their tariffs are to bealigned with the common external tariff.     Broadly they have reduced the difference between their former tariffs and thecommon external tariff by 60 per cent.     The final&quot;&apos;alignment isdue to take place in July 1968.The rates to be applied in the common external tariff aresimilar for a large range of products to those in the Britishtariff.Mspcl^ted Overseas Countries gnd jTerritoriesThe Treaty of Rome brought into association with theCommunity the non-European territories which had specialrelations with Belgium,  Prance, Italy and the Netherlands.In their commercial exchanges with associated countries the member states of the e.c. are to apply the same rates which applyamong themselves.     Imports into e.c. member countriesoriginating in associated countries and territories thus benefit from the stage by stage abolition of customs duties.     But thereare, however, special provisions regarding the customs duties/levied
levied by the associated countries and territories themselves,taking into account, among other factors, the needs for their development and the requirements of their industrialisation.The first Association Agreement concluded in 1958 was for five years, and a new five year agreement which extended thearrangements was signed in 1963 and commenced in 1964.     Underthe 1963 agreement Community tariffs on a number of tropicalproducts were abolished altogether.Although in principle the Associated countries tariffs on imports from the Community should be reduced by 15 per centannually and quota restrictions on these imports should be abolished within the first four years of the new Convention^life, the new arrangements in fact also give the african countries the specific right to retain old tariffs or createnew ones where these are needed to protect infant industries or to raise revenue.In addition to these arrangements, a Protocol annexed tothe Treaty (commonly known as the Morocco Protocol) provides forpreferential arrangements to be maintained between particular countries of the Six and certain territories with which they hadspecial trading relationships.An Association agreement concluded between Greece and the six provides for Greece to adopt over an extended period theCommunity&apos;s common external tariff,,      Special transitional arrangements were made to safeguard her particular economic position in the meantime.Turkey has also reached an Association agreement with the six of more limited scope than the Greek arrangement.      it provides for a start to be made on tariff disarmament byopening tariff quotas for products from Turkey.    a customs union is envisaged as a long-term objective.

FACTUAL BOOKLET ON EUROPECHAPTER 5:   AG-RIC ULTUREThe differences between the agricultural policies of the U.K. and theE.E.C. reflect differences between the agricultural situations here and in the six.    Britain produces only half of its total food requirements and about   twothirds of its requirements of temperate foodstuffs.     The E.E.C. on the otherhand produces about nine-tenths of all its food requirements and is self-sufficient or in surplus for many of the main temperate foodstuffs.British agricultural and feod policiesBritish policy is based on the Agriculture Acts of 1947 and 1957.     The main objective is to maintain a stable and efficient agricultural industry, able toproduce as much of the nation&apos;s food and other agricultural produce as is desir-able in the national interest.     The Government reviews annually the economic condition and irospects of the agricultural industry, in consultation withrepresentatives of agricultural producers, and then fixes the level of government support for the coming year.     Support is given in the form of guaranteed prices for the main agricultural commodities (cattle, sheep, pigs, eggs, wool, milk,cereals, potatoes and sugar beet) and direct farming grants (designed to raisefarm productivity and encourage certain types of production) .     In general the guaranteed prices are maintained, where necessary, by &quot;deficiency&quot; payments to farmers.     Under this system the agricultural industry is given support whilemarket prices for basic foodstuffs are allowed to remain^ at or near world price levels.     In the year 1965/66, the Government spent an estimated  237 million on total agricultural support.Horticulture is not supported by deficiency payments but by tariff protection against competing imports, and by assistance designed to help improve the industry&apos;scompetitiveness. he S.E.C&apos;3 Common Agricultural policy the Treaty of Rome provides that the Common Market shall extend to agricultureo trade in agricultural products:    and that over a transitional period theigmber States shall develop a common agricultural policy.Under the Treaty, the Community has made a series of regulations and decisionsdesigned to lead to the eventual establishment of a common agricultural market,
and give effect to a common agricultural policy.     This process is not yet com-plete, and the single market stage - when there are no longer any barriers totrade between member countries - is only due to be reached for the main agricul-tural commodities during 1967 and 1968.     But the main lines of the policy arenow established.     It comprises three basic elements:    the common organisationof markets for particular commodities;    common price aims for particular commodities;    and arrangements for financing the policy.In 1962 a series of regulations wore made for wrganising the marketing ofsome *f the principal commodities.     The cereals regulation made then has cometo be regarded as the prototype for the Community&apos;s market organisation, and,although the separate regulations for particular commodities differ Quite widely,the general philosophy underlying the cereals regulation informs them all.     Itis that tho protection of national markets against other Community producers shouldbe progressively eliminated and a common market for Community producers established.:that producers are to look primarily for their returns to a managed common market and not to price guarantees or subsidies?    and that in order to ensure that they receive reasonable returns, the Community market should be protected by charges on imports from non-member countries.     For cereals, the aim of the common organi-sation of the market is defined in terms of a target price, and the protection from imports takes the form of variable levies designed to raise the price ofimports to at least that target price.     This protection is, in the case of cereals,supplemented by a system of support buying at intervsntien prices somewhat belowthe target price and by the subsidisation of Community exports to other countries.The arrangements for other commodities vary - for some there are no target priceser intervention arrangements - but all have the same general purpose of establish-lnS a common market and supporting that market wholly or in part by charges on imports.The regulations for the various commodities provide for the gradual adjust-ment of price levels in each member country to a point where all barriers to trade between members can be removed and Common producer price levels established fordie whole Community.     These common prices are of two kinds:    prices which areto some extent fixed, if only as aims or targets, by decision of the E.E.C. Councilof Ministers;   and prices which come about naturally as a result of establishing
% common market in the commodity in ouestion.     Common target prices for cerealsare due to come into force from July 1967, and for milk and beef from April, 19^8.The single market stage for pigmeat, eggs and poultry is due to begin in July 19^7.The Community has created an Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund to finance the common agricultural policy.     The Guidance Section of the Fund financesassistance for improving the structure of agricultural production and marketing.The Guarantee Section - much the greater part of the total Fund - finances inter-vention or support buying and the subsidisation of exports.     The Community havedecided that from July 19^7 to December 19^9, member countries should hand overto the Fund sums equal to 90 per cent of the levies collected on imports of food-stuffs from non-members.     Latest estimates of the total cost of the Fund at the single market stage, put it at about  580 millions a year.     It is estimated that nearly 1+0 per cent of this total may come from the proceeds of levies on imports:the remainder has to be paid from the national exchequer of member states on a fixed percentage scale of contributions.summary the broad differences between the two systems are as follows:-(i)   In the E.E.C., the nroducer looks for his return to a managed market,protectad by charges on imports, and the cost of support falls mainly on the consumer.     In the U.&apos;&quot;C., the home producer is guaranteed aminimum return through the deficiency payments system, imports come inat lower prices, and the cost of support falls largely on the taxpayer,(ii)   The levels of producer prices differ.     In general, E.E.C. prices arehigher, but the relationship between trices for cereals and for mostlivestock products favours cereals more than in the U.K.^fuller account of the two systems, with detailed consideration of particular commodities, is given in a paper submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food to the Select Committee on Agriculture, and published inMinutes of Evidence for 15th March (H.M.S.O., price 4s.)
CHAPTER 6THE EUROPEAN ECONOMYWestern Europe is one of the most important economicregions of the world and plays a vital part in world tradeand industry.   Although the countries of Western Europecomprise only about 3 per cent of the world&apos;s total land sur-face, they account for about 10 per cent of the world&apos;total population.Western Europe &apos;spJL,a^Western Europe has a population of about 375 million people,  180 million more than the USA and 145 million morethan the USSR.   About 180 million people live in the sixEEC countries and almost 100 million in the seven efta countries (with their associate, Finland), of which some55 million are in the United Kingdom.The countries of Western Europe supply over two-fifths of world exports and are an important market for exports fromall over the world.    In 1965, their imports per head of popu-lation were twice as high as those of the United States.Western Europe is dependent on the outside world for manymajor industrial raw materials, including most of its oil supplies, for tropical foodstuffs and for a small proportionof its requirements of temperate foodstuffs.    The growth ofindustrial activity and improved living standards have greatlyWesternincreased/Europe&apos;s demands for imports in recent years, and thevalue of its imports from the rest of the world nearly doubledbetween 1958 and 1965.Western Europe contains one of the world&apos;s biggest con-concentrations of industry.    The main European industrial zonestretches from the central lowland of Scotland and the northern and midland counties of England, through Belgium, North-EasternCh. 6.    1
France and the Ruhr in Germany, to northern Italy.   Basedoriginally on coal and Iron, it now produces almost all types of manufactured goods.    In 1965, Western Europe produced nearly two-fifths of the world&apos;s passenger cars, nearly a third ofits crude steel, a quarter of its electricity and about a fifth of its coal.Western Europe and the^United states the economy of Western Europe has grown, rapidly during thepast 15 years.    Total output has about doubled since 1950.But although output in Western Europe has been rising more rapidly than in the USA, the absolute level in the USA isstill very much higher, and the real income per head of population is probably nearly twice as great in the USA as in western Europe as a whole.Production of electricity per head of the population hasincreased considerably in Western Europe in recent years, but itis still only about one-third that of the USA.   western european output wf steel, however, is now larger than USoutput, and steel output per head of the population in the UKand the e.c. is about 80 per cent of the US level.The growth of output in Western EuropeBetween 1958 and 1965, total output and output per headgrew faster in e.c. countries than in the United Kingdom.Industrial output grew by about a half in the e.c., but lessthan a third in the UK;    agricultural output on the otherhand, increased considerably faster in the UK than in the e.c..The leading growth industries have raried from country tocountry, but almost everywhere production in the base metal,engineering and chemical industries has risen by more than theaverage.    There has been a shift in the pattern of outputtowards manufacturing, and, within manufacturing industry itself, away from old-established industries such as textilesCh. 6. 2
to new technologically advanced industries such asengineering, chemicals and electronics.The table shows the changes in output of some majorproducts in the UK and e.c. between 1958 and 1965.    Outputof m *st of these products has been rising less rapidly inthe UK than in the e.c..    The notable exceptions have beencommercial vehicles,  sulphuric acid and man-made fibres(and also shipbuilding, where output in the UK has contractedless than in the e.c.).Agricultural output in the UK is a smaller percentageof total output than in any of the e.c. countries.    The shareof production industries (manufacturing; mining andquarrying; gas, electricity and water; and construction) inUK national output is less than in Germany, about the sameas in France, and considerably more than in Belgium, theNetherlands and Italy.    The contribution of the service sector(commerce, transport, health, education, public administration,etc.) in the UK is more important than in France, Germany andItaly, but less than in Belgium and the Netherlands.The big rise in industrial output in the e.c. has beenobtained partly from the rapid increase in industrial employment and partly from the higher productivity which has accompaniedheavy investment in modern machinery and equipment.

at 3 sEmploymentEmployment in manufacturing industry accounts for overa third of total civilian employment in the UK, Germany andBelgium;    in the other e.c. countries it absorbs between a quarter and a third.Agricultural employment accounts for a smaller share oftotal employment in the UK than in any of the e.c. countries.With the exception of the UK and Belgium, where agriculture&apos;s share of total employment is similar to its share of total output, there is a considerable disparity between agriculture&apos;contribution to output and its claims on manpower.    In the uk agricultural employment is about 3i per cent of totalemployment and accounts for about the same proportion of total output.   On the other hand, agriculture accounts for nearly a fifth of total employment in Prance but contributes less thana tenth of the total output;    it accounts for just over a quarter of Italy&apos;s total employment but provides less than asixth of total output.Up to 1966 employment in the Community as a wholeremained at a high level and all countries, other than Italy,recruited additional labour from outside the Community.    It isnot possible to use the published unemployment statistics ofthe Member countries to produce a figure of unemployment forthe Community as a whole because the concept of unemploymentdiffers considerably from country to country but Communitysources state that Community workless numbered 1.1 million(1.4 per cent) at the end of October,  1966.    This compares with 405,000 (1.3 per cent) in the UK in mid-October.    TheCommunity authorities have announced that unemployment in theCommunity recently appears to have shown an upward trend which
was accentuated towards the end ef 1966 and is continuingin most Member States, particularly Germany and theNetherlands.    Although the number unemployed in Italy has declined considerably, that country still has the highestunemployment rate in the Community.

Ch. 6.    9InvestmentThere is a significant relationship between a country&apos;sgrowth rate and the proportion of its output which is devotedto capital investment.The UK devotes a much smaller share of output to invest-ment than any of the e.c. countries.   We show up slightlybetter in the rate of increase in the volume of investmentsince 1958? where we are about level with Belgium, although we have been exceeded by France, Germany and the Netherlands.Since the early 1950s and in common with all european countries, the UK has been using proportionately more ofits output on capital investment and less on private consumption;    but private consumption in the UK is stillrunning at a proportionately higher level than in the EECas a whole.
TechnologyIn some *f the countries of Western Europe, the growth ofthe labour force is slowing down and there is a growing needfor the introduction of more efficient production methods andmore investment in labour-saving machinery and other new andtechnically advanced equipment.    There have been some bigimprovements in industrial technology in recent years, and moreand more resources are being devoted by governments t**scientific research and development.According to an OECD study , there were over half amillion people engaged in scientific research and development in Western Europe in 1962.    In the same year, the estimatedgross expenditure on research and development was much higher in the UK, both per head of the population and as a proportionof total output, than in Belgium, France, Germany and theNetherlands.   Many more people, representing a much higher proportion of the total working population, were engaged in research and development in the UK than in these other european countries.The scale of the resources committed to research in western europe is, however, considerably smaller than in the UnitedStates, and governments are working vigorously to expand thescale of scientific research and development in western european countries.    International cw-operation in researchis developing rapidly.    The formation of larger national andmulti-national industrial groups is being encouraged, largeprojects are being promoted in &apos; co-operation between individual countries (for example, the Anglo-French Concord project), and international research organisations have been set up (forexample, the European Space Research Organisation and theEuropean launcher Development Organisation).teearch^and Deyjelapmfint^fforrt in Western Europe, North america the^Spyjet Union.&quot; OECD.&quot;196515s.Oh. 6.10.
 or        --WagesWages have risen rapidly in Western.Europe in recentyears.    The pressure on labour resources has increasedeverywhere and the steady fall in the level of unemployment has resulted in an acceleration in the rate of increase in wages.    Although prices have also been rising,, the increasein the cost of living has been a good deal less than inthe rise in earnings, and there has been a real increase in european living standards.In the UK wages have increased more slowly since 1960than in the e.c. countries;    they have also risen lessproportion to the rise in prices than in the EEO countries,so that the increase in real wages in the UK has beencorrespondingly lower.
Social security the social security systems of the six e.c. countriesprovide much the same range of benefits as the UK system,but there are many differences of emphasis and method.The e.c. countries have no National Health Services, butmedical treatment is provided as an insurance benefit forinsured persons and their dependent^ generally throughre-imhursing them for the whole or part of the cost of anytreatment received.    Apart from family allowances, benefitrates are generally related to earnings.   A much smallerpart of the cost falls on general taxation than in the uk.    The main burden is borne by the c ftntributions ofemployers and insured persons.    There are many special schemes for particular industries.    The administration of benefits is not done directly by Government department S j   ISin the UK, but mainly by independent institutes run by representatives of workers and employers.Ch. 6    12

BRITAIN&apos;S TRADE IN WESTER;&quot; europe the Grq^wth jof world tradeIn recent years, world trade in manufactured goods hasincreased about twice as fast as trade in raw food and otherbasic materials.     Exports of manufactures by the twelve mainmanufacturing countries grew by an average of 8^ per cent a yearbetween 1955 and 1965* while exports by the &quot;primary producing&quot;countries grew by only ki Per cent.Many factors have been at work in promoting this stronggrowth of trade in industrial goods.     Among them are:    thehigher rate of economic growth in industrial countries,  the growing sophistication there, not only of technology; but of consumer tastes, and the liberalisation of trade throughtariff cuts and removal of other restrictions.Nearly nine tenths of all exports of manufactures by countries outside the Sino-Soviet bloc come from the twelvecountries - three in BETA:    Britain, Sweden and Switzerland;the Six e.c. countries;    and the USA, Canada and JapansThese, with some other industrially developed countries,are also the largest and fastest growing markets for eachothers&apos; sales.      The primary producers have more slowly growingexport earnings with which to buy more manufactures.In 1965, nearly two thirds of all exports of manufacturesby the 12 countries were sold in Western Europe includingBritain, and North America,  (Canada and USA     ).      Within these areas the e.c. has shown the biggest increase as an importer andis second only to Sweden in growth as an exporter.      In 1955,the Six sold 38 per cent and bought 17 per cent of the total.In 1965, they sold h6 per cent and bought 27 per cent.A965 was the latest year for which full internationalstatistics were available at the time of writing.Ch 7.1.
2 0 2Europe&apos; s expanding market in the ten years, Western Europe&apos;s total imports have notonly grown very fast,  compared.with most other areas, hut thefastest growth has been in imports from within Europe.      (Seecharts 1 and 2).Western Europe,   including Britain,   increased its totalimports by about 120 per cent.      N.America and OverseasSterling Area imports both grew by about 80 per cent,   those ofthe rest of the world by about 75 per cent.While Britain&apos;s share of world imports^ dropped from about12 to 8 per cent, between 1955 and 1965, the share taken by therest of Western Europe rose from about 33 per cent to 1x2 per cent.Taking manufactures alone, Western European imports including those of the UK rose by 210 per cent,  those of the e.c. by260 per cent and those of our EFTA partners by 180 per cent.Where European imports come fromThe fastest growth of trade in manufactures has been thatof e.c. countries&apos; imports from each other.     They rose by330 per cent, while imports from non-e.c. countries rose by190 per cent.Continental EFTA. countries&apos;  imports of manufactures from each other rose by 260 per cent,  those from non-EFTA countries by 160 per cent.As a result of this fast growth of trade within Europe,  the eec supplied h2 per cent of all e.c. imports in 1965 (see chart 3)compared with 29 per cent in 1955,  and 59 per cent of imports of manufactures compared with h9 per cent.Continental EFTA countries supply only a fairly small shareof each others&apos;  total imports, but this,  too,  has increasedconsiderably.Ch 7,2 //In*Excluding imports by the Sino-Soviet bloc.
In 1965,  80 per cent of e.c. imports of manufactures and85 per cent of those of Continental efta came from western europe,  including Britain.About 85 per cent of UK exports are manufactures.      And alarge part of the &quot;non-manufactures&quot; we export,  such as whisky,are in fact, products of British industry, for which demand isstrongest in developed countries.The broad composition of our total exports has not changedmuch in recent years.     But our exports of chemicals, machinery,cars,  consumer goods,  and food,  drink and tobacco have all risenfaster than the rest.The big change has been in the destination of our exports.(See charts h &amp; 5).      In 1955,  28 per cent of them went to western Europe.      In 1965,  37 per cent went there.      western europe has overtaken the Overseas Sterling Area as our biggestexport market.Our exports to the world have grown by &apos; an annual average of nearly hi Pe^ cent in value over the decade.      Exports to western Europe have grown by lust over 8 per cent a year, and exports to the Sterling Area by lust over 1 per cent.Our exports of every main type of &quot;goods (except ships and aircraft) have grown faster in the European market than in theworld or the Sterling Area,  and in most cases, faster than inthe USA (See chart 6).     More than half our re-exports,  not included in these figures,  go to Western Europe.      We sold very nearly  100m. worth there in 1965.Exports to the EECIn the ten years, our exports to the e.c. have more than doubled,  growing at an annual average of over 9 per cent.      The EC bought 19 per cent of all our exports in 1965,   compared with1h per cent, in 1955./ThisCh 7.3
2 D ^This growth has not been steady.      Our exports to e.c. roseby 18,  16 and 1h per cent in 1961,  62 and 63.      But there wasvery little growth in I96h and I965.      In the earlier years,British firms were making special efforts in the expectation of britain joining the e.c..      The falling away was partly due torecessions in France and Italy, which particularly affected oursales of cars.      Our exports to the e.c. picked up again in 1966,when they rose by 6 per cent.All the e.c. countries are now among our top 13 tradingpartners.      Germany has been a particularly strong export market,  taking 5.k per cent of all our exports in 1965,   comparedwith only 2.6 per cent in 1955.Exports to BETAAlthough our exports to EFTA have grown slightly less fastover the decade,  they have nearly doubled,  groyning at an annual average of 7 per cent;    and in I96h,  our exports to efta beganrising faster than those to the e.c. and have continued growingmore strongly ever since, by 12 per cent in 196k, 7 per cent inI965 and 11 per cent in 1966.      efta bought over Mi per cent ofall our exports in 1965,  compared with under 12 per cent in1955.      Sweden is now seventh among our main trading partnersand Denmark 11th.EFTA is one of our best markets for textile exports andan important one for ships.      Our sales of machinery and consumer goods there have been rising well.Our exports to the Western European countries outside bothEETA and the e.c., particularly those to Spain, have grown evenfaster than those to the two main groups - by an average of10 per cent a year.      But they still make up a very small proportion of our total trade./TheCh l.k
The composition of our exports to both e.c. and efta is broadly similar to that of our total exports to the world.Over the decade,  our exports of chemicals,  textiles andsome other semi-manufactures have grown faster to EFTA than tothe e.c..     And in 1965 the UK exported more textiles,petroleum products, plastic materials and transport goods toEFTA than to the e.c.&apos;s much bigger market.Although,  in total,  our exports have grown faster to the eec than to EFTA over the ten years, we still have a much smaller share of the e.c. than of the EFTA market.How we compareOur exports to Europe have done well, but some of our competitors have done better.Chart 2 shows how both e.c. and Continental EFTA imports of manufactures from all non-member countries together, and from theUSA have grown faster than those from Britain.     Over the period1955-1965 both Britain and the USA have been more successful in holding their share of third-country imports in the e.c. than inselling to Continental EFTA, although we are a member of EFTA.Germany has done better in selling to Continental EFTA than wehave.     However,  it should be remembered that the EFTA tariff reductions began only in the second half of the period,  and that since 196A our exports have been rising more rapidly to EFTAthan to the e.c..The fastest growth in e.c. imports of manufactures was fromother e.c. countries; this was twice as fast as the increase inEEC imports of manufactures from Britain.Chart 7 shows how our performance compares with the world&quot;sin the separate countries.     Only in Switzerland and Austria,comparatively small markets for our goods, have we increased our/shareCh 7.5
share of the market for manufactures since 1955.     Our share ofthe market in Germany, Italy, Portugal and Sweden has declinedrelatively slowly, hut it has fallen relatively fast in finland and in Norway where? however, deliveries of ships happened to hevery high in 1955 and unusually low in-1965.Britain&apos;s share of all exports of manufactures to western europe by the 1 2 main manufacturing countries has fallen from15 per cent in 1955 to about 11 per cent in 1965.      Italy hasincreased her share from h per cent to 9 per cent.      Germany,Prance and the Netherlands have slightly increased their shares,Germany supplying over a quarter of the total.      The USA has heldher share at about 13 per cent of the total.The Pattern of 3ritish Imp o r t sBoth the composition of our imports and the share coming from different sources has changed a lot in the ten years.(See chart ix).Pood and raw materials made up h.7 per cent of the total inI965, compared with 62 per cent in 1955.     We import a growingproportion of chemicals and other semi-manufactures.     and finished manufactures have trebled their share of the total,rising from about 5 per cent in 1955 to over 15 per cent in1965.This great increase in our imports of finished and un-finished manufactures has made Britain, like other industrial countries,  a much faster growing market for industrial countries&apos;  exports than for those of primary producers.     Andpur imports from Western Europe have grown more than from anyother area.      They grew at an annual average of 6.5 per cent ayear over the decade, while imports from the world gre?/ at.9 per cent./Western&apos;\;kti:. &apos;  Ch 7.6
Western Europe&apos;s share of our total imports rose from under26 per cent in 1955 to 33 per cent in 1965, while the sterling area&apos;s share fell from nearly kO. per cent to just over31 per cent.QHJlJL^-^-^-^gom Western EuropeOur total imports from Western Europe have &quot;been growingrather less fast than our total exports to Western Europe -at 7.2 per cent a year from the e.c. and 5.7 per cent from efta.But our imports of manufactures have been rising faster than our exports, at over 10 per cent a year from Western Europe as awhole.A large rise of nearly 20 per cent in total imports from western Europe in 196k fell away to a growth of about 5 per centin 1965 and 9 per cent in 1966.Our imports from efta and the e.c. are made up verydifferently both from each other and from our total imports fromthe world.      (See Chart 8).Raw materials and semi-manufactures make up a much larger proportion of our imports from efta than of those from the world,mainly because of our large imports of wood, paper and pulp fromScandinavia.Prom the e.c. we import a very much smaller proportion offood and raw materials than from the world.      On the other hand,over a third of all our imports from the e.c.,  are of finished manufacturers, over half of these being machinery.We buy not only a higher proportion, but a greater quantityof food, particularly meat and dairy produce, and of raw materials from efta than from the e.c. and about the same quantity of semi-manufactures, other than chemicals.Chart 9 shows the large share of our total imports of some important industrial goods which come from Western Europe.     Over/UO per centCh 7.7
I4.O per cent of all our imports of machinery and chemicals, and nearly 60 per cent of all transport goods now come from the eec.     More than a third of all our iron and steel imports comefrom BFTA.The Balance of trade we do not need to make a surplus on our trade withparticular areas, but if deficits occur in some areas they mustbe offset by surpluses elsewhere.Our balance of trade with Western Europe varies a gooddeal from country to country and from year to year.      But in balance of payments terms - that is, taking both imports and exports fob- we have earned a surplus with Western Europe inevery year since 1961.      In 1965,  the latest year for which figures on this basis are available,  the surplus was over 80 million.Ch 7.8

BRITAIN&apos;8 TR/0)E JifiTH OTHgR countries to help put our trade in Western Europe in perspective,this chapter gives a brief summary of our trade with other partsof the world.As Chapter 7 showed, we now do over a third of all our tradewith Western Europe.     About another third is with the OverseasSterling Area.      Of the remaining third, more than half is withNorth America, and less than half with the rest of the world.Chart I shows how our top ten trading partners,  with whomtogether we do just half of all our trade, are scattered amongthe different groups of countries.     There are three members ofthe Commonwealth,  two ex-members still in the Sterling Area,  one1ETA and three I EC countries,  and the USA.Since 1955,  the USA and Canada have kept their places atthe top,  the USA with an increasing share, Canada with adeclining one.      (Although Canada is our second biggest supplierof imports,  she is only our sixth biggest export market).     TheEuropean countries - notably Germany and the Irish Republic - andSouth Africa, have gained ground,  while Australia and New Zealandhave lost it.Our Commonwealth and Sterling trade between 1955 and 19S5,  our trade with the Commonwealth and sterling Area has grown much more slowly than the rest.     (canada and, at present, Rhodesia,  are the only Commonwealth countries notin the Sterling Area.      Several countries,  including SouthAfrica,  the Irish Republic,  Iceland and some Middle East states,are in the Sterling Area, but not in the Commonwealth.)Between 1955 and 1965 our exports to the Commonwealth (asconstituted in 1965) rose by 1l  per cent from 51,205m. to/Sl,3h3m.Ch 8.1
 -) 3U3ni.,  and our imports from the Commonwealth rose by 10-g-per cent, from 31,55hm.  to 3ls7&quot;l8m.In the same period our exports to the rest of the worldrose by 93 per cent,  from .31,752m   to S3, 383m, and our importsfrom the rest of the world rose by 69 per cent, from 32,382m. to. /.-., 033^1.Within the Commonwealth,  our exports to Canada grew by about1t? per cent a year, while those to Australia remained at about thesame level and those to New Zealand actually declined.Within the Sterling Area,  our exports to the Irish Republicgrew by 5i per cent a year and those to South Africa by over  per cent a year.Our exports to the less developed Sterling countries rose byabout -g- per cent a year.Our share of the total Overseas Sterling import market has fallen from about 3U per cent in 1955 to 23 per cent in 1965.The e.c.&apos;s share has risen from under 12 per cent, to nearly15 per cent.      In the Canadian market,  our share has fallen from to 7 per cent, while the e.c.&apos;s has risen from 3 to 6 per cent.This slow growth of trade with the Commonwealth and sterling area is partly the result of the very high proportion of their imports which we supplied in the years following the last war.Dollars were scarce and sterling was not convertible into other currencies.      (In the last decade the USA has had a falling shareof the Latin American market, where she was in an even moredominant position than Britain was in the Sterling Area).In 1950, about h0 per cent of all our trade was within the sterling Area - a much higher proportion than in the 1930s whenCommonwealth preferences had their greatest effect.     although these still help inter-Commonwealth trade, world-wide tariff/ cutsCh 8.2
cuts and new protective tariffs in Commonwealth countries with,developing industries have reduced the advantage they give.The USA, partly helped by her aid programme,  Germany and japan, all trebled their exports of manufactures to the sterling area outside Europe between 1955 and 1965.     Ours rose by about one sixth.     Japan&apos;s exports of manufactures to Canada quin-tupled, Germany&apos;s trebled and ours rose by about a half.Britain&apos;s large partIn spite of our falling share, Britain still plays a verylarge part in Commonwealth and Sterling trade.     Chart 2 shows the importance of our exports in the markets of our larger tradingpartners,  the importance of the UK market to their exports,  and how these vary greatly from country to country.The UK supplies nearly a quarter of all Sterling countries&apos;imports and buys a quarter of their exports, a much larger sharethan is sold or bought either by the e.c. or the USA.Because Canada does far more trade than any other of our commonwealth partners, and the vast bulk of it is with the USA,Britain&apos;s share of the overseas Commonwealth&apos;s trade is a gooddeal smaller than the USA&apos;s.In Australia,  the USA now has almost as large a share of theimport market as we have,  the e.c. only half as much.      ButAustralia now sells almost as much to the e.c. as to Britain,  anda good deal less to the USA.In New Zealand,  our exports have over a third of the market,much more than those of the USA and e.c. put together.New Zealand sells almost half of all her exports to us,  and abouta quarter to the e.c. and USA together.      Most of New Zealand*sexports to the UK are of food, and she is heavily dependent onthese to finance essential imports./South AfricaCh 8.3
South Africa buys nearly a third of her imports from Britainand sells us more than a third of her exports. She does about a fifth of all her trade with the e.c..India buys less from us than from the e.c. and much less from us than from the USA.     But she sells nearly a fifth of her exports to Britain,  the same amount to the USA and only a thirdas much to the e.c..Whai^e^m ortPood and raw materials make up about 65 per cent of our imports from the Commonwealth, a much higher proportion than they make up in our total imports from the world.      Semi-manufacturesprovide  bout 20 per cent,  oil and other fuels about 5 per cent,and finished manufactures only about another 5 per cent.Because of the non-Commonwealth oil states in the sterling area, fuels make up 15 per cent of our Sterling Area imports, andwe import a smaller proportion of food, raw materials and semi-manufactures from the Sterling area than from the Commonwealth.But again, finished manufactures make up only about 5 per cent ofour Sterling area imports.      It is important for many commonwealth and Sterling countries with developing industries to build up their exports of manufactures.JItth the JJSAThe USA. imports more than any other single country.      Inthe decade 1955 - 1965 our exports there were rising at over7 per cent a year,  only a little less quickly than those to western Europe and our share of imports into the USA increased from under 5^- per cent to a little over 6^ per cent.      However,several other countries,  not only Japan, Germany and Italy,increased their share more rapidly than we did./OurCh 8.U
Our imports from the USA over this period rose by lessthan 5 per cent a year compared with a 7 per cent a year growth in our exports there.     Over a third of these imports are of finished manufactures,  and we even buy more of these from theUSA than we sell there.The USA sells almost as high a proportion of her exportsto the SEC as we do.      She sells far more to the e.c. than to britain, while Canada sells rather more to Britain than to the eec.Apart from Western Europe, the Sterling Area and north america, the rest of the world together bought about 1h per cent of our exports and provided 16 per cent of our imports in 1965.This trade was divided fairly evenly between the non-SterlingMiddle East (UK exports -3186m., UK imports  182m.) latin america ( 159m.  283m.):    non-Sterling Asia,  including Japan( l2/.i.m.,  133m.) and Eastern Europe,  including Russia ( 113m., 220m.).     Our exports to non-Sterling Africa were worth  36m.and our imports from it  79m.Our exports to Eastern Europe have been among our fastestgrowing, almost as fast as these to Japan.      Both however,  stillaccount for only a small share of our total exports.     We do mortrade with Finland,  for example,  than with either Russia orJapan.     Our exports to Latin America have grown at a slower rate than our exports to the world.From all the &quot;rest&quot; together we imported about  50m.  of finished manufactures in 1965,  about 5 per cent of all our imports from these countries.      Oil,  meat and metals are ourbiggest imports from Latin America:    wood, metals and meat fromEastern Europe:    oil and fruit from the Middle East:    andmetals, minerals and textiles from Asia and Africa.Ch 8.5
