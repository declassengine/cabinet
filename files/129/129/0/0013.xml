DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)BRITAIN AND THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY?COMMONWEALTH INTERESTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth affairs it may be useful if I set out briefly for the information of mycolleagues the effects on Commonwealth countries of(i)  our joining the European Economic Community withoutobtaining safeguards for essential Commonwealth interests;(ii)  the arrangements Commonwealth Governments are likely toask us to secure on their behalf, and(iii) what is likely to be negotiable.Entry without safeguardsZ.       Commonwealth countries have traditionally exported their produce to the British market duty free.    Moreover, they at present enjoy anaverage tariff preference of about 12 per cent.    If we joined theCommunity and applied levies or the common external tariff (as appropriate), most Commonwealth imports would, after the transitional period, face a positive duty where they now have free entry a,nd reversepreferences in favour of the Community where they now have preferences.Community products would tend to replace Commonwealth products inour market.    This situation would affect different commonwealth countries in differing degrees.3.       The biggest problem is New Zealand.    In 1965-66, we took45 per cent ( 168 million) of her total exports.    We took 83 per cent( 50 million) of her mutton and lamb, 86 per cent ( 47 million) of herbutter and 78 per cent ( 16 million) of her cheese.    If we entered theCommunity without special safeguards for New Zealand, mutton and lamb would be subject to a 20 per cent tariff.    Butter and cheese, which fall within the common agricultural policy, would be subject to levieswhich, at present levels, would almost double the landed cost ofNew Zealand supplies.    As a result, New Zealand would face immenseeconomic difficulties.C(67) 63COPY NO.25th April, 1967CABINET-1-
4.       The effect on Australia would be less serious but still important.We take about one-fifth of her exports.    The commodities she sells tous which would be particularly affected include dairy produce( 25 million), meat ( 31 million), wheat ( 11 million), sugar ( 17 million),all types of fruit ( 18 million), and lead and zinc ( 14 million).    TheAustralian Government estimate that, if we entered e.c. without anysafeguards for them, their exports to us would drop by  80 million.5.       One-seventh of the exports of Canada come to us.    Canadian ministers told us last week that three-quarters of these exports (i.e. about 300 million) would face tariffs or levies if we entered e.c. includingpractically all their cereal and fishery exports to us, over one-third oftheir other agricultural products, almost 90 per cent of the semi and fully manufactured goods they send us and half their exports to us ofsuch items as newsprint, aluminium and wood pulp.6.       A number of small Commonwealth countries and dependenciesrely heavily on sugar exports for their livelihood.    Mauritius^ Barbadosand St. Kitts derive 90 per cent of their export earnings from sugar, andGuyana and Fiji over 50 per cent.    For Trinidad and Jamaica theproportion is 25 per cent.    The Commonwealth Sugar Agreement (CSA),which runs until 1974, ensures that these producers can sell agreedquantities of sugar to Britain at a price (at present  47 10s per ton)which covers their production costs and shows them a profit.    this compares with the present world price of under  20 a ton.     TheCommunity is a net exporter of sugar and has a surplus of 400, 000 tons compared with our total imports of 2.1 million tons.    If we abandoned the CSA on joining the Community, much of the Commonwealth sugarwhich we now import would have to be sold at world prices.    This would almost certainly result in the economic collapse of the countries concerned coupled with widespread unemployment and political unrest.7.       As regards the rest of the Commonwealth, they are mainlydeveloping countries and even a small fall in exports to Britain could have unfortunate repercussions in terms of balance of payments and the prosperity of particular areas and communities if we could not securesafeguards for them.    We are directly responsible for Hong Kong,20 per cent of whose exports would be affected,What the Commonwealth Governments are likely to ask us to secure8.       (a)   New Zealand.    Permanent arrangements to maintain the levelof New Zealand&apos;s exports to Britain or to the enlarged community (or her export earnings).(b) Australia.    The same, except to the extent that prices and access to the enlarged Community for cereals, meat,dairy produce and sugar are assured by international commodity agreements.(c) Canada.    The same, but with little expectation that we could secure more than transitional arrangements.
(d) Independent African and Caribbean countries.    Theopportunity, as in the 1961-63 negotiations, of applyingunder Part IV of the Treaty of Rome for either(i)   comprehensive association, like the signatories of theYaounde Convention, or(ii)   limited association, like Nigeria, or(iii)   trade agreements with the enlarged Community.A Morocco-type Protocol, as provisionally agreed in 1962,for Botswana and Lesotho.(e) Independent Asian Commonwealth countries.Association as in (d), with the possible exception of malaysia which would be affected only marginally by our entry into the Community.    India will want us to securecertain tariff reductions on specific commodities and access for cotton textiles.CO    Cyprus and Malta.    Association under Article 238 of the rome Treaty (i.e. similar to the association arrangements which the Six have concluded with Greece and Turkey).(g) Dependent Territories and Associated States in the CaribbeanAssociation under Part IV of the Rome Treaty, asprovisionally agreed in 1962 except for:-(i)   Swaziland.     A Morocco-type Protocol as provisionallyagreed in 1962.(ii)   Gibraltar .    Transitional arrangements to allow theColony to adopt her free port status to her new positionas an integral part of the Community.(h) Sugar producing countriesContinuation of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement until1974 and if possible thereafter;  if not possible itsreplacement by arrangements equally favourable to commonwealth producers.(i) Irish republic the Irish intend to apply to join e.c. if we do and wouldconduct their own negotiations.    If they are accepted thereis no problem at this stage.9.      This is not an exhaustive list.    In particular, we can expect to beasked by the Commonwealth Governments concerned to make special arrangements to safeguard exports to Britain of tobacco and bananas and,in the case of certain African countries, their exports of temperateagricultural products.-3-
What is likely to be negotiable10.     It is clear that we could not expect to secure everything in theabove list.    How much we would obtain for Commonwealth countries isat this stage largely a matter of guesswork.    The areas in which weshould have great difficulty in satisfying Commonwealth desires, and inwhich we might fail, include the following2-(a) New Zealand    We might have a hard struggle to securepermanent as distinct from long-term arrangements for her.(b) Australia ahd Canada   We should probably be unable to secure any permanent derogations for them and the outcome would probablybe transitional periods for the gradual application of the levyand/or the common external tariff, with perhaps some reducedduty quotas on a few industrial raw materials.(c) Independent Asian Commonwealth countries    There would be no prospect of obtaining association for them.    All that we wouldbe likely to secure are the arrangements agreed provisionallywith the Six in 1962, i. e. comprehensive trade agreements andsome tariff reductions and quota arrangements for them.(d) Hong Kong    Again, there would be no prospect of obtainingassociation and we might have to settle for an arrangement under which the common external tariff would be applied to imports into Britain from Hong Kong over a transitional period,with provision for review if damage was being caused to her.(e) Sugar.    We might have great difficulty in persuading the Six toagree to adequate arrangements for the sugar producing islands.11.       If these guesses are correct, we should have considerabledifficulty with certain Commonwealth Governments, particularlyAustralia, the sugar producing islands, and, perhaps for certain commodities, India.    If the guesses prove over-optimistic, our entrycould inflict severe economic damage not only upon these countries butalso on New Zealand and perhaps Cyprus, Malta and the Caribbeancountries.    In either event, a number of Commonwealth countries wouldbe likely to claim, with some justice, that we had not fulfilled our commitment to safeguard their essential interests.12.      What is said above concerns only the effect our entry into the EECwould have upon the interests of Commonwealth countries and their exports to us.    But of course the abolition of the preferences we give to commonwealth countries and the erection of reverse preferences against them in our market would inevitably lead them to terminate the preferences they accord to us.    This would lead to major reductions inour exports to the Commonwealth.    Mr. McEwen, the Deputy PrimeMinister of Australia, told me yesterday that he estimates that we would lose  160 million of exports to Australia which is about half our present level of exports to her.    Though I do not necessarily accept his figure,it is a fact that nearly  1, 000 million of our total exports enjoy preferences.H.W.B.Commonwealth Office, S.W.I.25th April, 1967-4-CONFSDENTIAL
