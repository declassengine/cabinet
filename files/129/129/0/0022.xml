W,10 Downing Street, S.W.1,1st May, 1967
DRAFT OF PRIME MINISTER&apos;S STATEMENT INTHE HOUSE OF COMMONSMr. Speaker,With permission I should like to make a statement.Her majesty&apos;s Government have today decided to make an application under Article 237 of the Treaty of Rome for membership of the European Economic Community andparallel applications for Membership of the European Coal andSteel Community and Euratom.As the House will recall I stated on 10th November lastthat my rt. hon Friend the Foreign Secretary and I wouldembark on &quot;a series of discussions with each of the Heads ofGovernment of the Six, for the purpose of establishing whetherit appears likely that essential British and commonwealth interests could be safeguarded if Britain were to accept theTreaty of Rome and join e.c.&quot;.     AHansard 10th November, 1966Column 1540/These discussions took place between January and March.Since then the Government have carried out an exhaustiveexamination of all the issues involved, resulting in the decisionI have just announced.The reports I have made to the House   have made it clearthat during the discussions in the Six capitals there was noquestion of negotiating about possible British entry to e.c..But my rt. hon. Friend and I, and indeed the House, have reasonto be grateful to our hosts for the very frank exchanges which preceded today&apos;s decision.These exchanges have enabled us to identify the major issues which we, for our part, shall wish to see settled in thenegotiations.On the Treaty of Rome itself, as I informed the house on 10th November, we have throughout our discussions taken the view that, as I then said, &quot;. .. the Treaty of Rome is not initself or necessarily an impediment.    There are anxieties . ..but the Treaty need not be an obstacle if our problems can bedealt with satisfactorily, whether through adaptations of thearrangements made under the Treaty or in any other acceptable
manner&quot;.     /Column 1546/.    In short, as I said then,&quot;the Government would be prepared to accept the Treaty of rome, subject to the necessary adjustments consequent uponthe accession of a new member and provided that we receivesatisfaction on the points about which we see difficulty&quot;.Our discussions in the capitals of the Six haveconfirmed this approach in terms of the practical working ofthe Community and its institutions.It is in this spirit that the Government intend to embark on the negotiations.    The House will, I am sure, aga-eethat they ought not to be unnecessarily prolonged orcomplicated with lesser issues, many of which can be bestdealt with after entry.     It is our hope that the negotiationswill be followed through swiftly, and will relate to thesmall number of really important issues^ which have been identified through our recent.discussions, issuer on which agreement should be reached if the House and the country are to be satisfied that essential British and commonwealth interests will be safeguarded.    This is the spirit in whichthe original partners to the Community approached their ownnegotiations over ten years ago; and our recent meeting withour EFTA partners has confirmed that they tco approach thematter in the same spirit.I now turn to the major issues which it must be our purpose to resolve during the negotiations.First, there are the problems associated with theoperation of the Common Agricultural Policy of theCommunity - the problems of its potential effects on the costof living and on the structure and wellbeing of british agriculture; problems of the budgetary and balance of paymentsimplications of its system of financing; and certainCommonwealth problems with which I will deal in a moment.As I have already made clear, publicly, we must berealistic and recognise that the Community&apos;s agricultural policy has come to stay as an integral part of the Community:we must come to terms with it.    But the House will feel that
the consequences of that policy for British agriculture involvefar reaching changes in the structure of British agriculturewhich will require an adequate transitional period to enable thenecessary adjustments to be made in our agricultural structure.The House will also share the Government&apos;s viewthat the financial arrangements which have been devised tomeet the requirements of the Community as it exists todaywould, if applied to Britain as they now stand, involve aninequitable sharing of the financial cost and impose on our balance of payments an additional burden which we should notin fairness be asked to carry.There are also highly important commonwealth interests, mainly in the field of agriculture, for which it is our duty to seek safeguards in the negotiations.    these include in particular the special problems of New zealand and the interests of Commonwealth sugar producing countries,which are at present safeguarded by the Commonwealth sugar agreement.    We have, as the House knows, been in touchwith all our Commonwealth partners, and will make special arrangements to keep in close consultation with them, aswith our EFTA partners, throughout the negotiations.Again as the House knows, capital movements raise questions of special importance. Our discuss ions suggest thatthese can be dealt with by suitable arrangements.Another important issue is the question of regional policies.    Here too we had to satisfy ourselves that we shouldbe able  as members of the Community, to continue to takethe necessary steps to ensure the industrial and social develop-ment of those areas of the country with which this House is always and rightly especially concerned.    Our discussions withthe Heads of the Governments of the. Community, not least theinformation we were given about the policies currently being pursued by member countries, have reassured us that theHouse need not have cause for anxiety on this score.As I have said, these are major and important issues butI can tell the House that the Government believe that there is nothing either in the Treaty of Rome, or in the practicalworking of the Community which need make them insoluble.-3-
And it is in this spirit that we for our part willapproach these negotiations.Mr. Speaker, I have gone into some detail aboutcertain specific economic issues, on which hon.   members are rightly concerned.    But the Governments decision hasbeen motivated by broader considerations of economic policyand still wider arguments to which I will turn later.     On theeconomic arguments each hon. Member will make his own judgement of the effect on exports and imports, on industrial productivity and investment.     Equally, every hon. Membermust make his own assessment of the economic consequences of not going into the Community and, in an age of widereconomic groupings, of seeking to achieve and maintainviability outside.But all of us are aware of the long-term potentialfor Europe, and therefore for Britain, of the creation of a market of perhaps 300 million people, with all the scope andincentive which this will provide for British industry, and of the enormous possibilities which an integrated strategy fortechnology, on a truly Continental scale, can create.    I am glad to say that my rt. hon. Friend and I found that thisconception has made a great impact throughout Europe.But whatever the economic arguments the house will realise that, as I have repeatedly made clear, theGovernments purpose derives above all from ourrecognition that Europe is now faced with the opportunity ofa great move forward in political unity and that we can -and indeed must - play our full part in it.    As I said lastweek &quot;.. . Our conception of European unity is not based onsomething narrow or inward looking.    Europe has a part toplay in world affairs which we in Europe are not at presentplaying.    Britain has her own vital political links with africa and Asia, her vital role within the Western alliance - as haveother European countries.
&quot;But a Europe that fails to put forward its fulleconomic strength will never have the political influence which I believe we could exert within the alliance, withinthe United Nations, and as a means for effecting a lastingdetente between East and Westj and equally contributingin ever fuller measure to the solution of the North-Southproblem, to the needs of the developing world. &quot;It is for ail these reasons that we intend to pursueour application for membership with all the vigour and determination at our command.    As I told the House last november, &quot;We mean business&quot; - and we shall live up toour words.The House will of course wish to debate this decision at the earliest opportunity and arrangements will be madefor a three day debate next week.    We shall of course seek to meet the requirements of the House for the fullest possible information over the coming weeks.    An initial White paper will be laid later this week and we shall take the opportunityof the debate,and of further White Papers which will be laid,to enable the House, and public opinion generally, to form afull, fair and informed judgment of the great issues involved.For all of us realise that this is a historic decision whichcould well determine the future of Britain, of Europe and indeed of the world for decades to come.-5
