(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67) 7129th April, 1967COPY NO.G 6CABINETTHE APPROACH TO EUROPE:  VALUE-ADDED TAXMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate a note by officials covering questions raised in theCabinet at their meeting this morning (CC(67) 24th Conclusions, Minute 1)on the arrangements for a value-added tax in the European economic community and on their implications for the United Kingdom in theevent of our entering the Community.L. J. C,Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.29th April, 1967
THE APPROACH TO EUROPE;  THE VALUE-ADDED tax and THE community note by OfficialsArticle 99 of the Rome Treaty provides for the harmonization ofturnover taxes, excise duties and other forms of indirect taxation.    Theimmediate objective of this clause is to remove the distortions to trade that result from arbitrary allowances at the frontiers in respect ofcascading turnover taxes.    The ultimate objective is the abolition of the fiscal frontiers between member states so that in intra^community tradetaxes will no longer have to be rebated on exports or imposed on imports.To achieve this ultimate objective, it is considered necessary to havean identical system of indirect taxation throughout the Community so thatany item at any stage of production will have borne the same tax burdenin all member countries.2.      In pursuance of these objectives the Council of Ministers haveagreed to two directives which provide for the adoption of a system of value-added tax in replacement of existing turnover taxes by membersof the Community by 1st January, 1970.    The present directives permitexemptions for particular categories of goods;  they do not require theextension of the tax to the retail stage; they do not cover agriculture(for which, however, a further directive is envisaged) and the workingof the system is to be reviewed in two years.    The present directivesdo not cover the rates of taxation.    However, the Commission is tomake proposals for the manner and timetable of the harmonization ofrates before the end of 1968.3.      The present note assumes that we shall be given a certaintransitional period to introduce the TVA system in this country, and afurther transitional period for the harmonization of rates.    It is assumed that if we entered the Community by 1st January, 1970 we should have tointroduce the TVA system by 31st December, 1972 and harmonize the ratestructure with the rest of the Community by, say, 1975-77.Nature of the TVA4.      The value-added tax is a species of a general turnover tax withcredit given to traders for the taxes they pay on their purchases.    Thisis best explained by an example.    Suppose the rate of the tax is 10 per cent and the trader (who may be a producer of materials or components, or awholesaler or retailer) sells goods for  100j he charges  10 on sales tothe buyer which is shown separately on a sales voucher; but he only hasto account for so much of this tax to the Revenue as is in excess of theamount he paid himself on his purchases of materials and components.Supposing that he paid  55 for his purchases (including  5 tax) he needs to account to the Revenue for  5 of the  10 tax collected by him on hissales.5.      The most important feature of this tax is its comprehensiveness.It is levied at all stages of production and distribution, from the rawmaterial to the finished commodityj    though agriculture is not coveredby the existing directives and retailing is not required to be within thescope of the tax at present.    However, once such a system is introduced-1-
it is quite inevitable that it should sooner or later extend to allcommodities and to all traders - for any trader left out of the systemcamfot claim relief of the tax on the things he purchased and cannot rollthe burden forward by imposing an equivalent charge on his sales.    Forthis reason continued exemption would not be in the interests of theagricultural community since they would not be able to recoup the taxespaid on their purchases of fertilizers., seed, machinery, etc.6.      However, comprehensiveness does not imply that the rates of tax paid by the final consumer on different classes of goods need beuniform.    Differentiation could be introduced in the final stage and an appropriate adjustment made for the tax paid at earlier stages.    in theory, therefore, necessities like food, fuel and light, or rent, couldbear a nil rate of tax.    In practice, however, complete exemption wouldinvolve serious administrative difficulties.    To illustrate this, supposing that food was nominally exempt, tax would have been borne on the materials, fuel and capital goods used in its production and transport.It would only be possible to eliminate this tax burden by a massivesystem of repayments.    After an examination in depth of the problems involved, the view of the Customs is that we would find, in the same way as France and Germany have found, that a repayment system would entail such complexities of administration as to make it unfeasible for adoption.7.      Hence the best way to avoid having heavy taxes on necessities isto have a low basic rate of, say 5 per cent and higher rates (which could go up to the present purchase tax rates) imposed on defined classes ofgoods at the manufacturing or wholesale stage.    The introduction of a tax of this kind would need to be phased over a transitional period offive years.    Assuming a fully comprehensive tax extending to servicesof all kinds, including house-rents, it would increase the net yield oftaxation (after allowing for the absorption of the purchase tax at thepresent rates) by about  800 million and it would increase the cost ofliving by around 4 per cent.    If compensating reductions were made inexcise duties by cutting the present rates on beer and spirits by one-half,the extra revenue yield would be  500 million and the rise in the cost ofliving would be Z\ per cent.    Even so, the change would involve aconsiderable shift in the incidence of taxation - particularly betweenhouseholds of different family size - which could only be offset by highersocial security cash benefits.8.       While a tax with the above features would conform to the presentdirectives of the Community, ultimately we need a tax with a ratestructure that conforms with that to be agreed by the other countries ofthe Common Market.    If one takes the current average yield of turnovertaxes among the Six as the basis, this would imply a tax with a generalrate of around 14 per cent, with a lower rate of perhaps 7 per cent on food, an overall average of around 12 per cent.     The consequences ofthis on the cost of living index would be substantial, though somecompensating reductions could be made by lowering the present excise duties on beer and tobacco.-2-
9.       It should however be borne in mind that all decisions concerningthe harmonization of the rates and coverage of taxation need to be unanimous.    Once we are members of the Community we shall be ableto exert our influence in these matters.    In addition, the fullharmonization envisaged in Article 99 is still a distant objective.    Theris the question of the present monopolies - like the Italian and Frenchtobacco monopolies - as well as the question relating to differences inexcise duties which have not yet been tackled by the Community.-3-CO N FIDE NT!
