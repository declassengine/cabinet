The outcome is setforth in the attached draft White Paper.A memorandum, substantially in the form of this draft, wasconsidered by the National Economic Development Council at its meeting on 1st March and there have been subsequent talks with the confederation of British Industry (CBI).    These consultations have notled to any changes of substance in our proposals, but editorial changes have been made to the draft YtThite Paper in order to meet suggestions made by the Council, the CBI and the British National Export Council(BNEC).Work is already well in hand on action to implement theproposals in the attached draft and a combination of circumstances -notably, a conference of the BNEC on public purchasing and exports andthe National Productivity Conference, both to be held early in June -make publication of the White Paper by the end of May highly desirable.I therefore circulate it now for consideration at Cabinet on 9th May when shall report the views of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policywhich is to discuss the draft White Paper the previous day.M.

DRAFT WHITE PAPERPUBLIC PURCHASING AND INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCYPURCHASING- BY THE CENTRAL government it is the Government&apos;s policy to help to make British industry more efficient and competitive.   Public purchasing can be used to promotethis, and the Government intend, in consultation with industry, to seethat purchasing by Government Departments does so.2.     The Central Government buys about 5 per cent of the total outputof all manufacturing and construction industries, although the percentagevaries considerably industry by industry.   It has been long recognisedthat the Government has special influence and responsibility in relationto the efficiency and progress of its supplying industries and their exportperformance.   At the same time, the influence the Government can exert, asa purchaser, on any particular industry must depend to a significant extent on the proportion of the total output of the industry which it takes, or at least on the proportion relative to any other major purchasers.   Thisinfluence has been exercised, as with the aircraft Industry, in promoting the re-organisation of the supplying industry.   In the field of management,purchasing authorities encourage contractors to use, where appropriate,techniques conducive to   efficiency such as budgetary control, criticalpath analysis, value engineering and quality control.   Regional development is assisted by arrangements which give some measure of preference inGovernment purchasing to suppliers In Development Areas.3.     These are particular&apos; applications of the Government&apos;s purchasingpower in the pursuit of national industrial objectives.   They will continue,For example, there will be consultation between the IndustrialRe-organisation Corporation and Departments on ways in which Governmentpurchasing might help promote and assist schemes for structuralre-organisation in supplying industries.   The Government will also follow up ideas emerging from the Economic Development Committees, as those in thereports on &quot;Efficiency in Road Construction&quot; by a Working Party of theEconomic Development Committee for Civil Engineering.h-m     The primary objective of Government purchasing is to obtain what is needed, at the right time and in such a way as to secure the best value for money spent.   But there Is much that can be done to ensure that publicpurchasing provides positive encouragement to British industry to make-1- ONFIDEhmAL
itself efficient and competitive both at home and in markets overseas,for example,   the appointment from industry of a Head of Defence sales in the Ministry of Defence recognised the need to pay regard, at all stages of defence procurement, to the scope for promoting exports.5.     As another illustration, the Department of Education and Science,the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government andthe Ministry of Public Building and Works are co-operating in promotingdimensional co-ordination in building, the development and standardisation of building components and industrialised methods of building, which should lead to all-round economy and a market which goes far wider than Governmentneeds.   This particular effort is being linked to the changeover to the metric system by the construction industry, so that the unique opportunity which exists for the change not only to metric measurement but also todimensionally co-ordinated sizes will not be missed.   The British standards institution published with the approval of the industry   a detailedprogramme for the change on 21st February this year.   Full government support for it was announced at the same time and public procurement willgive effect to that support.6.     The relationship between Government and supplier in fact goes well beyond a simple and short-term buyer and seller nexus, particularly wherethe purchasing is a continuing activity and it is necessary to look ahead and plan for value for money tomorrow as well as today.   In developing itspurchasing policies the Government will continue to take every opportunityof using Government orders to improve the performance of its supplyingindustries, whether in productivity or In technological innovation, whichwill help exports and import saving.   There are several ways in which itis intended to do this.Encouragement of initiative and economy in production7.     Technological innovation will be stimulated if, in specifying their requirements and in evaluating tenders, purchasing authorities allow scopewherever possible for initiative by tenderers in meeting the need by newproducts or by advanced production techniques.   If, in other cases theyencourage the tenderer to propose alternative ways of meeting the require-ments, this will make it possible for him to use existing products,materials, components or production facilities and methods.   This will help to reduce manufacturing costs and often assist in keeping down export prices.
8.     Specifications which stipulate purposes and performance required,rather than the detailed specification of a product, are advantageous forthese purposes, and Government Departments will extend their use whenever possible.   In other suitable cases manufacturers will &quot;be encouraged tosuggest modifications to Government design specifications which nightwithout loss of efficiency secure some industrial or commercial advantage,including the promotion of exports.   Departments will be continually onthe lookout for opportunities of encouraging high and competitivestandards of industrial design.Variety control9.     Reduction in the number of similar varieties of products purchasedis a powerful method of promoting efficiency in production.   Both thebuyer and the manufacturer benefit.   The buyer gets cheaper supplies and lower administrative costs,   Tho manufacturer gains from larger orders and consequent longer production runs, which enable him to invest inimproved methods of production and to spread the cost of research anddevelopment and other overheads more thinly;   he is able to releasetechnical staff from work on modifications to undertake progressive development,10,   All the major purchasing Dejsartnents have officers responsible forvariety control, standardisation and rationalisation of purchasing ingeneral, and hence for attaining these objectives.   The recent establish-ment in the unified Ministry of Defence of a Directorate of SupplyCo-ordination should advance this process in an important area ofGovernment purchasing:   its tasks include the achievement, throughstandardisation of equipment and stores, of reduction in variety and greater operational and logistic efficiency.11,   An example of variety control within the Ministry of Defence is&quot;Systematic Machinery and Equipment Evaluation and Selection&quot; (SYMES).Under this system standard ranges of machinery and equipment are adopted for use as appropriate in all types of ships built within a specified period:   maximum use is made of commercial design.    In the Ministry ofPublic Building and Works, the variety of furniture and furnishings hasbeen reduced, not only in civil Departments but also, with theco-operation of the Ministry of Defence, in the Defence Services,&quot;Wherever possible, special requirements are being replaced by standardissues.   The Health Departments and hospital authorities are collaboratingin a number of variety control exercises and hospitals are being encouraged,for example, to use Ministry of Public Building and Works1 standard issuesfor office use.
12.   The Government is devoting considerable effort to studies of thefurther scope for variety control both within and between Departments.Departments already try to use trade products whenever appropriate, andto co-operate to avoid the proliferation of slightly differentspecifications to meet needs which might all be met by one product, butthey will re-assess those cases where non-standard products appear to berequired.     In seeking greater reduction in varietyt they will considerspecifying those products for which there is an existing or potentialdemand in home and particularly in export markets.     This should encourage large scale manufacture, and reductions in production costs,so as to improve the export prospects of the products concerned.St andardi s at i on13.   As Departments proceed with the elimination of unnecessary varietyin the products purchased, they will continue in all suitable cases to buy those types which conform to British Standards.     This will give a lead towards the general acceptance of these Standards in both the homeand overseas markets.     Departments already work very closely with theBritish Standard Institution (BSl) and its Councils, Committees andPanels.     when assisting in the formulation of British Standards theywill bear in mind the needs of all domestic users, and that it isnecessary to align them v/ith international standards as far as possible,or, where these do not exist, to see that they are, wherever practicable,acceptable In overseas markets.14.   Departments will also, when they find it necessary to draft theiro?m standard specifications, try to base them on British Standards andwill co-operate with BSI at an early stage in order to facilitate themaximum reconciliation between their needs and^ those of non-Governmentconsumers, especially where this will improve the prospects for exports.In order further to assist exports, purchasing Departments will help theBSI as much as they can in the formulation and adoption of a series ofmetric standards.Quality Assurance Schemes15.   Standardisation is indispensable to schemes which objectively measureproduct quality including performance, safety, and reliability.     such schemes can be extended to provide quality control, which ensures that thewhole production of a particular article conforms to minimum requirements,purchaser. Schemes of this kind enlarge the market for good products,and so tend to reduce their unit cost.and so removes the need for further inspection and testing by the
16.   The Kitemark Scheme operated by BSI is an example.     Another is the.    .. ... ........ .....     .Burghard Scheme, which is being implemented by the Ministry of Technologyin co-operation with other Departments, which applies standards in the assessment of electronic components.     The Government will support theimprovement and greater use of such schemes, and their extension to appropriate new fields.Evaluation techniques and facilities17.   Particularly where no standards exist or are not appropriate forhis purpose, the purchaser ought to know the relative merits ofdifferent products on offer.     This not only enables him to make the most efficient use of his resources but also stimulates industrial progress byfavouring products of good design and quality.     To meet this need in thecase of computers the Ministry of Technology have set up the ComputerAdvisory Service to assist the whole of the public sector.     Methods ofproduct evaluation, and of evaluating tenders, will be kept under reviewso as to improve Government purchasing techniques in the light of thebest practice in the public and private sectors.18,   There are in addition advanced technical assessment schemes theresults of which are available in suitable cases also to the private sector.     One example is provided by &quot;YARD&quot; (a joint organisation ofYarrow and Company, Shipbuilders, and the Admiralty Research Department),which among other functions carries out assessments, on behalf ofGovernment Departments and of private concerns, of ships, propulsionunits, and engineering products.     Another is the Agrement Boardestablished in 1965 by the Ministry of Public Building and Works to assessand certify new construction materials and methods.19.   These arrangements have the common purpose of assessing the performance of products and providing objective test reports on which to base purchasing decisions.     They should result in a reduction of thetime and effort spent by the customer in comparing one product with another.     The assessment of performance and reliability provided shouldoften simplify the preparation of ne?; British Standards.     The Governmentwill establish other schemes of this kind where needed, and will try tonegotiate reciprocal arrangements with other countries for the mutualacceptance of approved products.-5-Cp Nfl DE NTS AL
Co-ordination of purchasing20.   Centralised purchasing of common Government requirements is alreadycarried out to a considerable extent.     For example, the Ministry ofPublic Building and Works undertakes construction work for civil departments and for the Defence Services, and buys many of their requirements of furniture and supplies.     The Stationery Office is responsible for meeting all Government requirements for stationery,printing and office machinery.     The Ministry of Health buys drugs,dressings, and certain medical and surgical equipment for other government Departments, and for the Defence Services.     The Ministry ofDefence buys most motor vehicles for Government services, and petrol,oil and lubricants for a number of civil Departments.21.   In these cases centralisation has advantages arising from buying in bulk, including economy, variety control and standardisation.     Centralco-ordination of purchases is also being used to encourage the more effective use in the public sector of particular types of advancedproduct - for example, computers - and so to encourage technologicaladvance both amongst manufacturers and users of such products,22.   Purchasing in bulk will not always be advantageous.     As with thereduction in the variety of products purchased there is an optimum leveldependent on industrial capacity, on the economies to both supplier anduser of short haul deliveries and on the need to maintain competition andthe stimulus to innovation in the supplying industry.     None the less,the Government believe that there is considerable scope for the develq^ment of its purchasing in the ways described above to the benefit of the economy as a whole.Assisting suppliers to improve their efficiency23.   The Government will continue to look for&apos;other ways of assisting itssuppliers to increase their productivity and competitive power, and to  .examine critically, in collaboration with British industry, any purchasingpractices which seen to impede unnecessarily their efficiency ortechnological progress.     A number of specialist technological services to industry are being developed by the Ministry of Technology;   theNational Computing Centre and the Production Engineering Advisory service are examples.     The latter will devote part of its effort to assistingGovernment suppliers.     There is a range of Government-owned or subsidisedresearch establishments available to help industry, and of Governmenttesting and research facilities which are used by industry.     Governmentpurchasing Departments will encourage their suppliers - sub-contractorsas well as main contractors - to use these facilities.-6-
24,   The encouragement of advance in industry through measures of publicpurchasing should not be one-sided.    It is normal practice for purchasingDepartments to seek advioe from industry, and they will adopt appropriatepurchasing practices proved in industry to be beneficial both to purchasersand to their suppliers.   As part of this process Marks and Spencer . aremaking available to the Government their experience in this field, and providing an opportunity for representatives of a number of purchasingDepartments to assess the relevance to public procurement of the techniquesdeveloped by the company,,25.   The Government will also continue to try to help industry by makingknown its purchasing requirements as far ahead as possible so that research and development can be started in good time, and the most advantageousproduction plans laid.   Purchasing Departments will continue to limit asfar1 as possible changes in specification after contract work has begun,particularly by thorough definition of development projects and of the types of equipment to be produced for defence needs.   In appropriate cases,Departments will explore with contractors arrangements which should be of mutual benefit by providing incentives for overall economy and efficiency,in particular through improved control of development, production andmaintenance costs.Consultation with industry26,   Fruitful co-operation between purchaser and supplier depends uponmutual regard for the interests of the other.   Government and industry have already established numerous channels for communication about purchasingmatters.   They serve all levels, and regular use is made of them.   It maybe that even more can be done to reduce divergencies of interest between government and industry in purchasing matters, and to facilitate the   develop-ment of the Government1 s purchasing policies to improve the efficiency ofBritish industry,27.   The Government will accordingly discuss with the Confederation ofBritish Industry the adequacy of the existing channels of communication to ensure co-operation between Government and industry in the measuresoutlined in this paper.-7-CONF1DENTSAL
PURCHASING BY OTHER PUBLIC AUTHORITIES28.   The review of public purchasing so far nade has been concerned withpurchasing by the Central Government.     The total value of purchases bythe rest of the public sector is substantially greater than that of purchases by the Central Government, .  The Government propose therefore to invite the co-operation of local authorities, the nationalised industries and other public bodies in a review of the ways in which the government&apos;s objectives in the field of public purchasing can best be attained in the rest of the public sector.-8-
