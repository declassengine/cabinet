DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENQi^llll COPY NO. JJLCABINETGREECEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in Cabinet on 11th May (CC(67) 30th Conclusions, Minute 2),I promised to circulate a note to my colleague si2. The aims of our policy towards the new Government in Greeceare:-(a) To be able to do business with it to protect Britishinterests (whether specific, e. g, the release ofMrs. Ambatielos, or general, e. g. the avoidance of trouble in Cyprus).(b) To influence it towards a return to parliamentary and democratic procedures and a restoration ofcivil liberties in Greece.3.      Some days after the coujd it became clear that the presentleaders had full military backing and effective control of the country.Meanwhile the King remained Head of State and diplomatic relationsbetween ourselves and Greece continued to exist.     The choice facingus was this.    We could enter into working relations with the new regime and pursue the objectives explained above.    Or we couldcondemn them publicly, refuse to have working relations with them,and possibly even break off diplomatic relations, in the hope that ourown interests would not suffer unduly and that our attitude would helpbring about their overthrow or at least make them uncomfortable.4.      The second course would have fitted the sense of shock andrepugnance which we felt and still feel at what happened in Greece.But it would have left us with no direct means of speaking our mindsto the new leaders.    And I do not think that they would have been affected in the way we wanted by a policy of standing back andcondemning them.5.      We chose the first course.    I believe that it was right thenand that it remains right now.    Most of our friesxds and allies takethe same view.     The Danes, with some sympathy from the Norwegians,do not.    But their efforts to lead public and official criticism of theGreek regime have not shaken the regime, although they have causedsome trouble in NATO.-1-
6.      I think that we are having more influence in Athens, in theright direction, than we would have if we took the Danish line.    Wehave a tough and experienced Ambassador, who is well able to judgewhat is likely to influence the men in power and what is likely toantagonise them and strengthen the forces of extremism.    He knowsvery clearly what our objectives are,    I have told him myself.    AndI am satisfied that he is saying the right things to the right people.7.     Meanwhile we are doing nothing which would imply approvalof the regime^ policies or close co-operation with them (e, g. Ministerialvisits, or arms supplies).    All we are approving are statements ofgood intent on their part about a return to constitutional government, etc.And we shall watch carefully to see whether these statements aretranslated into action.    If they are not, it will be a matter of finejudgment how long we should keep up our present attitude.     Theremay come a point, if no progress   is made in the right direction,when we will decide that we could work for our objectives better ifwe changed our policy.8,      But the regime is still in a formative stage.     Conflictingpressures are at work within and upon it.     We have more chance atpresent of helping to remould it as we wish by our present policythan by making public pronouncements of disapproval.    These mayventilate feelings here but they will not make the men who hold power in Greece more susceptible to our influence.G. B.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.16th May, 1967-7
