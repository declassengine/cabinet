W. 1.17th April, 1967
SECRET &quot; g gCONSULTATION WITH EFTA AND THE COMONWEALTH MD THE IRISH EE PUBLICReport &quot;by the Chairman pf the Official Committee on EuropeAt their meeting on 13th April the Cabinet agreed that the ProneMinister should &quot;arrange for the Cabinet to consider at an early date amemorandum on consultation with the Commonwealth and EFTA&quot;(CC(67) 20th Conclusions, Item 2).     This memorandum sets out the resultsof consideration &quot;by officials of alternative methods of consultation, and ofthe timing of such consultation in the context in which it needs to &quot;beconsidered, i.e. the timetable for further consideration by the Cabinet ofthe approach to Europe (CC(67) 20th Conclusions, Item 2).2.    We undertook a commitment to EFTA at the meeting in December 1966 of efta Heads of Government, and confirmed this commitment at the recentMinisterial Council of EFTA at Stockholm, to consult our EFTA partners&quot;before reaching a firm decision on the further development of our relationswith the e.c..     As regards the Commonwealth, we are committed by thePrime Minister&apos;s statement on 10th November 1966 to consult   with governments throughout..EFTA3.    For good reasons, namely to carry our EFTA partners with us and toprevent them losing confidence in our intentions, we were obliged to confirm,our commitment.     This commitment is expressed in the Communique issued after the Stockholm meeting, which said -&quot;On the proposal of the United Kingdom delegation, whioh was welcomed by the other delegations, Ministers decided to discuss the position againafter the United Kingdom Government had been able to review their owndiscussions in the Six capitals and before any final conclusions were drawn from them.&quot;if.    There are three possible ways of consulting EFTA,5.    First, a meeting at which we could indicate to EFTA colleagues what line we expected to take, but which was held before the Cabinet had taken a decision, is clearly ruled out.      Anything said at such a meeting wouldbe bound to leakj   and in any case no such indication can be given beforethe decision has in fact been taken by the Cabinet.6.    Second, a meeting at which EFTA would be consulted on a purelyhypothetical basis, and at which EFTA Governments were asked to react tothe various possible courses before us.      Thereafter, when the cabinet had taken its decision, in the light inter alia of EFTA views, EFTAGovernments would be informed of it at the last possible moment before itwas announced.-1-SECRET
7.    The disadvantages of the second course are that efta would find itnost unsatisfactory and would oonplain that we had merely done againwhat they disliked at the Lishoi meeting:   i.e, giving them no hint ofour intentions shortly before announcing a major decision.    A further difficulty to which a number of Departments attach major importance is that if such a meeting were held (and if it were held at all it oughtto be held soon) the news of it being summoned would be taken (howeverunjustifiably) as implying iiiat a decision to apply for membership ofthe Community was imminent;   and that this would be seized on by the Frenchor the Community as an excuse to reconsider or withdraw offers already made in the Kennedy Round.8,    A third possibility of dealing with the problem might be as follows.We should approach EFTA Governments fairly soon (shortly after the middleof April) through the diplomatic channel and speak to them in the f follow-ing sense.    We recognise the obligation we entered into at Stockholm tohold a further Ministerial meeting with them before we come to any finaldecision.     But any conceivable way of meeting this obligation has gravedisadvantages for all of us.     It is in fact impossible, for praoticaland Parliamentary reasons, for us to consult with EFTA Governments when we know what our decision is likely to be, but before we have actuallytaken it, and on the basis of indicating to them what the decision islikely to be.     Leakages would be certain and would be generallyembarrassing.9.    Alternatively, we could consult EFTA Governments at a meeting heldin the fairly near future on a purely hypothetical basis before we havetaken or even really approached a decision.     The EFTA Governments would,we feel, find this unsatisfactory.     It would really be no more than what we did at Stockholm in March.      If all EFTA Governments, however, urgeus to meet our undertaking by holding a conference for consultation ona hypothetical basis, we shall endeavour to do so in the near future.However, we consider that a more practical and realistic method of proceedinboth,for us and our EFTA partners, would be for the main process of
crijsultation to be carried out, in the first instance, through bilateralcontracts through the diplomatic channel, and possibly at a later stage in one or more meetings of the regular EFTA Council.    Wewould hope that such Council meetings, if held, would attract no special attention and avoid any complications in the Kennedy Round.If EFTA G-overnnents react positively to this first approach, we wouldintend to initiate bilateral consultation with them immediately,on a hypothetical basis;   and this process of bilateral consultationwould be followed tip by consultation in the regular EFTA Council in geneva.     On this basis, there would in fact be no ministerial meeting of the EFTA Council until we had taken our decision, though we would be better able to take into account all EFTA views as wemoved towards our decision.     We would then hope, if our deoision wereto apply for membership of the Community, that there could be a ministerial meeting of the EFTA Council to consider the situationand consult together soon after the Government&apos;s decision had beentaken,10.   Yife recommend that we should adopt the third course (paragraph 8)^and that we should do all we san to secure the agreement of our EFTAcolleagues;   but that, if this course is unacceptable to them we falltack on the second course (paragraph 6).      There is just sufficienttine for us to follow the third oourse, and if it fails, to fall backon the second provided that we make a start immediately on the procedureoutlined in paragraph 8 for EFTA, (and take corresponding action with theCommonwealth as set out in the following paragraphs).The ConQonwealth11 .   Commonwealth interests lie more in the terms that we shall seek thanin the question whether or not we apply.    We are committed to a continuing process of consultation.    There is accordingly no need to assemble representatives of all Commonwealth Governments at the same time,either before or after our decision is taken or announced.12.   Canadian Ministers will be in London on 19th-20th  April for theAnglo-Canadian Ministerial Committee.    The Deputy Prime Minister ofAustralia will be in London on 24-th April, and we have suggested thatthe Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand should come to London on25th, April, during the course of their visits to Geneva in connectionwith the Kennedy Sound negotiations.     Consultations with each can be heldthen, and followed up later at Ministerial or official level, as preferred*-3-
With other Commonwealth Governments consultation could he initiated by telegram at the same time as with EFTA.     The telegram might say that -(a) The study which the British Government were making of theresults of the exploratory discussions in e.c. capitals waswell advanced;(b) no decision had yet been taken but that the issue would haveto be brought to a head very soon;(c) in reaching a decision, the British Government wanted to takefully into account any general considerations which commonwealth governments wished to put forward at this stage on the hypothesis that Britain was considering applying to enter the Communitysubject to safeguards for essential Commonwealth interests;(d) the British Government wished to allow adequate time for full consultation with Commonwealth Governments;    and, if thedecision vas in favour of applying to enter the Community therewould be an opportunity for thorough consultations with commonwealth Governments on all points of concern to them during the coming months.Irish Republic13.   When the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister met on 19th December, theyarranged to have a further meeting after the Government have consideredthe results of the exploratory talks.     If possible such a meeting, forwhich Mr. Lynch would no doubt be willing to come to London, if necessary,should be held before the Cabinet reach a decision, and about the sametime as the Prime Minister is seeing the Australian and New ZealandMinisters.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.17th April 1967
