(this document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67) 76 COPY NO.5th May, 1967CABINETPOSSIBILITY OF CONSTRUCTING A SUPER AIRPORTAT SHEPPEY TO REPLACE HEATHROW AND OBVIATETHE NEED FOR FURTHER LONDON AIRPORTSMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade the Ministerof Housing and Local Government and I arecirculating jointly a memorandum (C(67) 75) on the Third london airport.    I think that it will be helpful to my colleagues if Isupplement this memorandum in the light of the publicity which haslately been given to the idea of constructing a super airport thatwould both replace Heathrow and eliminate the need for additionalLondon airports.    I do not regard the closure of Heathrow as aremotely practicable proposal: but it is perhaps worth setting outthe reasons in detail why Sheppey cannot be a substitute for it.     the site now suggested for the super airport is the Isle of Sheppey which,in the main memorandum, is considered (and rejected) as a site forthe third London airport.    The reasons for rejecting the idea of asuper airport on the Isle of Sheppey are as followsSize of the airport2.      In the 1980&apos;s, it is expected that there will be a demand for accommodation for some 500, 000 aircraft movements annually atLondon&apos;s airports and this total is likely to increase.    Accordingly,if Heathrow is closed and no other airport is built, the super airportat Sheppey - which would also have to accommodate Southendhs traffic -would require at least three pairs of parallel runways (six runways inall) or more than six if the runways are not parallel..     Such an airportwould have to be at least 4 miles in width in order to ensure safeseparation in the air for three parallel traffic streams and, to avoidcongestion on the ground, would probably have to be some 7 miles in length.     The Isle of Sheppey could not provide a usable area of this size.    The airport would, therefore, have to be extended over theRiver Swale which in itself might prove to be an insuperable obstacle,and into the North Kent mainland; at best, an inordinate additional cost would be entailed.    In addition, assuming the closure ofHeathrow, provision would have to be made for an increase in population of at least 250, 000 and it is hard to see how a majorencroachment into agricultural land of the highest quality could be avoided.-1-CONFSDENTfAL
Access to Sheppey3.     Sheppey is difficult of access from all parts of the countryexcept South East London and Kent,    From Central London the journey by road to Sheppey in the mid-1970&apos;s - the latest date bywhich the super airport must be operational - would take about100 minutes (more in peak periods), even assuming that a link with theM. 2. were constructed.    Substantial improvements to the rail services would be required and even so would provide a journey time of at least70-75 minutes.    The provision of a monorail link with Central london as suggested by the sponsors of this scheme would., if feasible, be extremely costly.Cost4,     Among other difficulties, the siting of an airport at Sheppeywould mean the closure and re-provision elsewhere (assuming asuitable site could be found which the Ministry of Defence considerextremely doubtful) of the firing range at Sheoburyness which isestimated to cost some  25 million.    The Draft White Paper estimates(paragraph 49) that the provision of even a two runway airport at Sheppeywould cost  132 million including  40 million for rail improvements and   2 million for the link with the M 2.     The cost of a super airportwould, of course, be substantially greater.5.     The sponsors of the super airport plan claim that this cost would be offset by the sale of the land at Heathrow which, according toa &quot;Times&quot; report, the estimate would produce  240 million (elsewherethey estimate the cost at  120 million).    Since Heathrow airportcomprises about 2,700 acres, the sale of this land would, in fact, be unlikely to produce more than  40-50 million.    The estimates of thesponsors of the scheme must, therefore, be considered as greatlyexaggerated.Other major difficulties6.      It is doubtful whether all the work necessary for the superairport, including a new Public Inquiry, could be concluded by timeHeathrow and Gatwick are saturated - in the mid-1970ls at the latest.7.      The replacement of Heathrow by Sheppey would mean the re -provision of all the airport facilities at Heathrow in which there hasbeen a public investment of the order of  40 million (written downvalue) and which still have a long life before them.    Moreover,substantial losses would fall on BOAC, BEA and other airlines whohave invested over  40 million at Heathrow and who would also haveto re-provide these facilities at Sheppey.8.      The super airport plan is strongly opposed by the british airports Authority - who would have to run it - and who are convincedthat it is the wrong solution to L.ondon1s air traffic problems.
Need for fourth London airport9.      The supporters of the scheme claim that the super airportwould both replace Heathrow and eliminate the need for a foxirthLondon airport whereas if Stansted were developed, a further london airport would be needed in the not too distant future.    As indicated inparagraph 2, however, nothing less than a six runway airport wouldbe necessary to replace Heathrow and cater for LondonTs traffic inthe 1980&apos;s.    To go further and cater for traffic growth for as far ahead as can be contemplated, the super airport would have to runto eight runways.     And even ignoring the fact that the techniques of controlling the air traffic of an airport of this size remain uncharted,there would be a further and disproportionate increase in the land required and in the ground handling problems.    This would press the concept of a super airport to the point of absurdity,    In fact, asargued above, it is impossible for cost and other reasons to envisagean airport at Sheppey with more than four runways.    This would mean that Heathrow would remain and that Southend would be closed,resulting in an effective gain of significantly less than the capacity of four runways.     It is, in fact, technically possible to accommodatefour parallel runways at Stansted even though at the Public Inquiry,and in respect of the same site area, only two runways and a shorterthird were considered;  and the development of Stansted does not interfere with Southend.    Thus Stansted would postpone the need fora fourth London airport for longer than would any practicable develop-ment at Sheppey - probably until the 1990*8.    And by the 1990rs it maybe that technological improvements will have wrought a marked changein our ideas about the eventual need for a fourth airport.     Thusimproved air traffic control techniques or the development of aircraftmuch larger than those at present in contemplation would effectivelyincrease the capacity of existing airports while the introduction of aircraft with short take-off and landing characteristics wouldrevolutionise thinking on the areas needed for major airports and,hence, on their siting.Conclusions10,     The super airport at Sheppey is very unlikely to be practicable,would, if practicable, be extremely expensive and would probably notbe ready in time to deal with the overflow from Heathrow and Gatwick;while a more conventional airport would accelerate the need for anadditional London airport.     It would involve the totally unnecessaryexpense of closing Southend, of closing and re-providing the firingrange at Shoeburyness (on the hypothesis that re-provision is possible)and would at best provide an airport extremely difficult of access fora large proportion of its users.    I cannot, therefore, recommend tomy colleagues that this idea should be entertained.D. P. T. J.Board of Trade, S. &quot;W. 1.5th May, 1967-3-
