C(67) 51 COPY NO.    0 313th April, 1967CABINETLOCATION OF DECIMAIi FACTORY AND NEW ROYAL, MINTMemorandum by the First Secretary of State andSecrefcary of State foEconomic affairs it is agreed that a temporary factory to produce decimal coinageshould be sited in a development, area ssad. that the Mint itself shouldsubsequently move to the same location.,    The decimal factory willprovide 500 jobs (450 to be recxuited locally) and the permameat Mintsome 1, 300 jobs of which over one-fiffch would be recruited locally.    Adecision on the site is now necessary and the choice has been narroweddown to Llantrisant in Wales, Curnbernauld in Scotland and washington in the Northern development area.2.       The Ministerial Committee on Environmental Planning have considered the annexed report from the Official Committee on Dispersal.The Official Committee agreed that there is a good case for any of thethree locations on employment grounds.    The Scottish Office, the welsh office and the Ministry of Housing supported Cumbernauld, Llantrisantand Washington respectively.    The other Departments were divided between two views?(a) that, as considerations of dispersal policy do not pointdecisively to any one of the three sites, the choice should,be left to the management of the Mint whose preferenceis for Llantrisant;(b) that an assessment of the various factors involved indicatesa slight preference for Washington.3.       In the Ministerial Committee, while there was considerable support for Washington, it was agreed on balance that the choice should fall on Llantrisant.    The Committee were mainly influenced by thefollowing considerations;(a)    The case on employment grounds is very strong.    Llantrisantis within easy commuting distance of the Rhondda Valley which,with male unemployment over 10 per cent and pit closures due in the next three years affecting 16 per cent of the malepopulation, presents one of the most intractable unemploymentproblems in the country.-1-GONF1DENTSALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT!
(b)    This in itself, however, would not be decisive in view of theserious unemployment problems in the other two areas.    Inthese circumstances, the deciding  actor should be the viewsof the Mint management.    These derive from the attitude ofthe Mint employees.    The staff associations prefer Llantrisantjthe unions representing manual workers are unwilling to state preference but have expressed particular opposition toCurnbernauldo    The Mint management consider that resistance to dispersal on the part of their employees could jeopardise the entire decimalisation project, or at least risk injury tothe Mint&apos;s export trade worth  7 million a year.    Theyconsider that the choice of Llantrisant would minimise these risk.4.      My colleagues should be aware of two other major dispersalprojects which are relevant, though they affect office staff and are notpredominantly industrial as is the Mint.    It was recently decided thatthe Ministry of Transport vehicle and driver licensing and test bookingcentre (2, 500 jobs, mainly for women) should be established at Swansea.A decision will be needed shortly on dispersal of Ministry of Defencesupply and production staffs (2? 500 jobs) and there are argumentspointing to South Wales as the best location.    The ministerial committee felt that, if the Mint goes to Llantrisant, we should need to consider carefully whether the Ministry of Defence staffs could be located in Scotland.    I have however since been informed that for operational reasons this is unlikely to be practicable.5.       The Secretary of State for Scotland was unable to accept themajority view.    He contends that the Mint should go to Cumbernauldon the following main groundss(a) The Curnbernauld area stands in most need of the additional employment.    It has suffered a high rate of unemploymentfor the last twenty years, future prospects are poor becauseof the expected rundown in shipbuilding, steel and mining, andthe situation would be even worse were it not for anunacceptably high rate of emigration.(b) The choice of site should not be determined by the preference of the present Mint employees, who in any case have not hada proper opportunity to assess the amenities of Cumbernauld.(c) It would be quite indefensible to allocate three major dispersalprojects to Wales, which, since 1963, has already had as manyGovernment jobs allocated as Scotland, with a much smallerworking population.6.       I invite the Cabinet to resolve this issue.M.S.Department of Economic Affairs, S. W,l.13th April, 1967
ANNEXA DECIMAL FACTORY AND A NEW ROYAL MINTReport by the Chairman of the Official Committee on DispersalThe Royal Mint is to erect a temporary factory to makedecimal coinage ready for the changeover in February, 19720    this factory needs ideally to be ready to produce coins by mid-1968 butthere is a latitude or. - few months on this target date.     Later, thepermanent Mint will be: rebuilt in a Development Area, and it wouldbe sensible to choose a location for the temporary factory which would meet the requ.irem.entr m. the lonper-r nza. for the rebuilt Mint,    Thedecimal factory wu&apos; c.&quot;-  &apos; j* ^--&apos;.v . !s&quot;0     ---v.-1 -     ^ &apos; permanent Mintsome 1,300 people,,2.      The Mint have, carried ooi a *mrvey of a number of sites andhave arranged visits by representatives of the Staff Associations and&apos;.C;?ade Unions to a iaumber of possible locations,,    Four places in development Areas are feasible locations,, but the choice lies in effectbetween three of these, namely Washington in the North-East,Cumbemauld in Scotland and L-lantrisc-j-nt in South Wales,    The fourthpossible location, Rune or n, has a certain advantage of easy sitedevelopment, but this aspect of the problem is not regarded as weighingheavily in the overall assessment, and Departments are agreed that,of the possible English locations, Washington has the greatest claim tobe considered, particularly on the basis of employment needs,3.      As between Washington, Curnbernauld and Llantrisant, thefollowing are some of the main considerations;-(i)      Cumbernauld has factories already at tender stage,with site development complete with the Corporationcould  rent to the Mint for decimal coinage production.This would help meet the production timetable.However the Mirr^s civil engineering consultants,Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners, regard these factories as unsatisfactory in that they are too smallto permit the economic deployment of the labour force.    They add that the timetable can be met in anyof the three areas,(ii)      The costs of site development at Cumbernauld andLlantrisant will probably be somewhat higher thancosts for Washington, Cumbernauld being probably the most expensive.    However, in relation to thetotal cost of the building and the manufacture anddistribution of the decimal coinage, differences ofthe order thought likely here are not very significant.
(iii) The Scottish Office contend that the region roundCvimbernauld is the one most in need of theadditional employment which will be brought notonly by the Mint but by the consequent industrialdevelopments which are likely to follow its establishment in any area.    They also emphasise that there is a high proportion of skilled employmentin the engineering and metal manufacturing tradesavailable in the region round Cumbernauld.    the welsh Office argue that South Wales (particularly theRhondda Valley which is within a few miles of theLlantrisant site and where the male unemploymentrate is now over 10 per cent) has the priority claim on employment grounds.    Similar considerationsarise in the North East where a rundown is expected in coal, steel, marine engineering and probablyshipbuilding,,    The Committee are agreed that a good case on the ground of employment needs can be madefor all three locations,,(iv) The representatives of the non-industrial staff associations have expressed opposition to all fourplaces on the ground that amenities such a a education and housing are inadequate.    However they say that without prejudice to that view their preference is in theorder Llantrisant, Runcorn, Washington, Cumbernauld.The industrial Unions have not provided an order ofpreference and may remain unwilling to do so.    Theyhave however expressed a particular opposition toCumbernauld.(v)      The Mint management emphasise the importance ofminimising the risk to coin production,    They point outthat the Mint industrial workers are not recruited onthe basis of the expectation of a move and thatresistance among these^workers could jeopardise theentire decimalisation project, or at least risk injury to an export trade of  7 million a year which once lostcould not easily be regained. ..(vi)      There are administrative advantages (particularly inrelation to the provision c  housing) in dealing with aNew Town Corporation on this project, which, as faras it goes, counts against Llantrisant.    The welsh office however say that they are in a position to ensurespeedy and co-ordinated action by local authorities andothers concerned on all matters related to the move andthat there would be no difficulty in providing adequatehousing.-4-
(S8 P. Osmond)31st March, 19674,      The Official Committee have inevitably found this a difficult problem to consider for the following reasons:-(a) The information provided indicates no decisive advantage forany one of these sites,(b) The views of the Staff and Trade Union Sides have been mainlyexpressed in the form of a strong opposition to dispersalanywhere and in a particular objection to Scotland? but thenon industrial Associations, whilst affirming opposition to any move, have now expressed a preference for Llantrisant.(c) The consultants do not appear to have reached a firm view infavour of a particular site, or of any particular balance ofadvantage.5.      Clearly any one of these three sites would meet the criterialaid down, and a decision to choose any one of them would accord with the Governments general policy on dispersal.    The Scottish and welsh Office representatives on the Committee have understandablyemphasised their preference for Cumbernauld and Llantrisantrespectively.    Similarly, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government,which has in this context a responsibility for watching the interests of english development areas, would support the claims of &quot;Washington.The other members of the Committee are divided between the following two opinions(i)      That, provided that a Department has taken into accountall the relevant considerations and that its eventual choiceis in accordance with the requirements of developmentpolicy, it should, since any attendant risk of failuremust remain the r-esponsibility of the Department andits Minister, be left to take its own decisions.    On this basis, the choice would fall on Llantrisant, which is theavowed preference of the management and, if there hasto be dispersal, the Departmental Staff Side, though not of the Trade Union who will express no view.(ii)      That an assessment of the various factors involved leads to a slight preference for Washington.    Its disadvantagesare in staff preferences and its distance from London,which will increase the cost of distribution of the decimalcoins.    It has a good overall score on building costs andthe supply of labour including skilled labour and as againstLlantrisant offers the advantages that may flow from theexistence for a New Town Corporation.
