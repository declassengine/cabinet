DISPOSAL OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE ^^^^morandum by the Lord President of the Council

The Home and^^Sjl^^l Affairs Committee (H) has discussed radioactive waste disposal on f^^Wcasions since November 1984. A decision is now needed urgently on the^klMtion and announcement of a shortlist of sites for disposal of low l30^%nd short-lived intermediate level wastes. On behalf of the Committee,il am reporting the considerations to Cabinet.

THE TECHNICAL BACKGR^p

2.	Low level and shortlived intermediate level wastes can be disposed

in relatively shallow sites, protected by concrete and clay. The longer   lived intermediate level wastes need to be disposed deeper underground. In both cases, one of the major points made by objectors is the danger that water will penetr^K to the waste itself, will become radioactive and will then leak t  Mfth the successive protective layers into the local drainage system.	of minimising water-problems is

to site the disposal facility clo^^HIj^^^ie sea, so that any wat  r draining from it will go quickly into the seyAc$*|e diluted there. The French have adopted this technique. The Minis t^of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are concerned about the possible^S^^^^ of the drainage of radioactive water from inland sites on f^W^cultural land and therefore would prefer a coastal site.

3.	A Ministry of Defence (MOD) requirementneed   to be borne in mind.

The MOD already has in storage one decommissioned nuclear submarine. They expect another two by 1992. The reactor casings of these submarines will require the same standards of disposal as low level waste, but, because of their great size and weight, they would be most easily transported by sea to a coastal site and moved a short distance inland to Abeir burial point.

4.	The alternative to disposal of this form of radi^pcti^^; waste, either on an inland or a coastal site, is to store it. This i^vo^s building large, above-ground facilities in which the waste can hectored and monitored. This is the technique adopted for the much sma^^rM^lumes of high level waste. It has been clear at least since the sij^k-j^ort of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution in 1976 that    ci^^^fic opinion does not think that this is necessary for low level wa^s.j^Last year&apos;s report by the Radioactive Waste Management and Advisory Comi|i^^e emphasised that &quot;There is no technical advantage in delaying


   either low level waste or intermediate level waste ... and no technical I barrier to their disposal&quot;. That is the view that underlies Government    evidence to the Sizewell Inquiry and which, on present assumptions, must L  nderlie evidence to the forthcoming Dounreay Inquiry.

^^^SGARCH FOR SITES

most recent Government statement was made in the House of Commons on^4 January 1985 by the then Secretary of State for the Environment, following discussion in H. Mr Jenkin said that the Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executive (NIREX) would be required to carry out geological investigations of at least three possible sites for each type of depositony^that for short-lived wastes, NIREX would be required to select an&lt;*ann||unce as soon as possible two possible sites in addition to one airoaHW^er, discussion at Elstow in Bedfordshire; and that NIREX should start^H^j^earch for alternative sites for deeper-level facilities, on which furtlrofflf^k was needed on the technical options. Mr Jenkin proposed that tl^^p  cning permission for the geological investigations should be conferrad^Nka Special Development Order that would be debatable in Parliament.

6.	Since January l^^NT^gX have limited their search to sites in public sector ownership. (This^d^Lows earlier trouble over a promising site owned by a private sectOT company.) In view of the considerations summarised in paragraph 2 of this note, NIREX have also sought to include coastal sites in their shortlist, and this is generally known to interested parties.

7.	Following the canvassing oW^J^us possibilities, the list submitted by NIREX for the shorter-lived waKgflkaow consists of Elstow (Bedfordshire), Fulbeck (Lincolnsl^R|^^$radwell (Essex) and South Killingholme (Lincolnshire). The f  |iiM|wo are coastal sites.

8.	A majority of H, regarding the m^ti^^^ one of nuclear policy, appeared to favour the NIREX proposal. ^M^boposals submitted by NIREX envisage that the explorations would tak^^l2i||j^L months: thereafter, decisions could be taken to focus on one o^krab^Lsites for a full planning inquiry. Any further delay in settling our v^ste^disposal plans could lead to a reopening of, or a challenge to, th^^izewell Inquiry, which could result in delay to the further development of the nuclear power programme. This would be very damaging to the United Kingdoc nuclear industry, which is already in difficulty.

9.	My Cabinet colleagues will appreciate the contro^eVA that would

inevitably arise in the areas affected by this decisi^.	it were felt

that the pressures would be of such an order as to make^H^^possible to proceed with the explorations of the four sites, it might^jip^sible to set up an authoritative new study of the whole question of 1 radAactive waste disposal. But the majority of H felt that delay woul^^mwge the interests of the nuclear industry.

   CONCLUSION

Since what is at issue here raises questions of major national ^JJtoortance, H thought it right to submit the matter to Cabinet for final

d&amp;PlLsion.
