ECONOMIC STRATEGY

tft Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer

The approach^O|^ne 1986 Budget is inevitably dominated by the dramatic changes taking^^Pl^k in the oil market. The large price fall that has already occurre^yne  ^ a sharp reduction in prospective oil tax revenues.

2.	The current	oil price of $17-18 per barrel is some 40 per

cent below the 6nd~^^S^S  |ira^r level     a change almost as great as the price increases of 1973 anafcJ979. It is hard in current circumstances to make a reliable judgment about^^^^^new level at which oil prices may settle. We therefore have to consirar the Budget against the prospect not merely of greatly reduced oil revenues but also considerable uncertainty about how large the reduction will be.

3.	Our current estimates sugges^ikthat if oil prices settle at $15 a barrel our revenues from the NoMjM^^a will be reduced to   6 billion for the next financial year. This clitpares with receipts of   12 billion in 1984-85. In last year&apos;s Medium TlB|rariancial Strategy (MTFS) we expected revenues of   lli billion for 1986   

4.	There has inevitably been some ti^afi^^^in financial markets as they have responded to the oil price change. St^y^ing has fallen by about

7i per cent and there has been persistenW^^ferd pressure on short term interest rates. So far we have weathered t^^fc^Llapse in oil prices and consequent financial market turbulence pret^^^^J. - though it may not be over yet. In so doing we are helped both by^roe underlying strength of the economy, xn terms of growth, inflation and the external account, and above all by the reputation we have acquired for sound and prudent policies.

FISCAL POSITION

5.	Faced with this background my judgment is that we n^sj^^pproach the Budget with considerable caution. We must avoid going

  7i billion Public Sector Borrowing Requirement figure set  u  in last year&apos;s MTFS. Indeed there is a strong case for going belo^%t, kearing in mind the proceeds of privatisation, estimated at   43/4 billiw next year.

6.	Much may change between now and Budget Day. Because non-o^p^^enues are now projected to be higher than expected I hope to be able t^aroid a


   net increase in taxes in the Budget. But there looks like being little, k if any, scope for a net reduction in taxation. We should just meet the ^^public expenditure planning total set for the current financial year. The l^^^eed to cope successfully with the unprecedented situation which the oil J^^ice fall has created for the public finances underlines the importance %?3^Pfcolding public spending next year similarly within the planning total have announced.

EOTNOMIC PROSPECTS

7.	But while	lower oil prices have a profound	impact on	what is possible

in the	Budget,	they should not greatly affect our overall	economic

performancei-|although there will be significant changes within the economy. fcK^he world as a whole, lower oil (and commodity) prices will have benej^K^keffeets in 1986 on the oil-consuming countries. The forecast foi^^^^ajor industrialised countries is for the output growth averaging 3 p^j caht - a little better than achieved last year. Inflation will stay low: mndPad in Germany and Japan it is likely to approach zero.

8.	For the UnitOTjJladom. the oil price fall has not caused me to

revise	my view	that^M8n  will be a further year	of steady	growth, at	an

annual	rate of	about^^^^kcent, accompanied by	declining	inflation.

Different parts of the^econWny will be affected in different ways by lower oil prices. While the	sector will not do so well, manufacturing

industry in particular should benefit considerably.

9.	The United Kingdom economy is now in a stronger position to take advantage of the opportunities crated by lower oil prices. The underlying improvement shows upftS^ number of indicators. Last year manufacturing productivity increased by a further 4 per cent. Since 1979 it has now grown at an average anilu^^ate of 3^/4 per cent. As the table below shows, our performance here ^mpares very favourably with the recent past; and even with the majority of K: j^^ncipal overseas competitors.

10.	Capital spending by business has generally been rising f^fcerjthan output in recent years and further growth is expected in 1986, response to higher profits and continued expansion in output. performed well in 1985:	indeed, United Kingdom exporters increase tj^r


   share of world trade. The prospect is for continued export growth, albeit | at a slower pace. Even after the fall in oil prices, another sizeable ^^urrent account surplus is in prospect for 1986, helped by rising earnings our increasing stock of overseas assets. (Our net overseas asset iro^tion is now second only to that of Japan.)

^this year is likely to see a significant rise in consumer spending,    ni^^^flects rapid growth in real disposable incomes - itself a result of th^^igh level of wage settlements in 1984   85 and the reduction in inflation expected this year. Earnings are currently rising at or over 7i per cent. With inflation likely to fall to 4 per cent this year, the average employee&apos;s pay may rise by some 4 per cent in real terms during

1986    dl	   

12.	HoweveilRfhis excessive earnings growth remains the chief threat to jobs. Despit^^%^fe years of continuous output growth, and a growth in the number of peop^^^^ork of over 600,000 since the last election, which I expect to continue,, ^unemployment is unlikely to show much of a reduction while wages rise sjdffhik ahead of prices. The plain fact is that, despite our very good prodrc*B^  y record, United Kingdom unit labour costs have been increasing muc^mor^^apidly than those of our competitors.

13.	Annex 1 sets out	figures from the forecast. Annexes 2 and 3 set

out the revenue effects Wc selected tax changes, together with a note on the tax burden.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

14.	The dramatic change in oil	has had a major - and adverse -

impact on the public finances; bi^ft very much hope that, thanks to the sound financial policies we have bHen%^llowing, it will prove possible to avoid raising taxes overall in the	The impact of lower oil prices

REVENUE EFFECTS OF TAX CHANGES A. Direct Taxes: Indexation

The RPI increased in the year to December 1985 by 5.7 per cent. With indexation by this amount and statutory rounding, the figures for the main allowances and other thresholds would be:

Personal allowances	1985-86	1986-87

  	E

Single and wife&apos;s earned income allowance	2205	2335

Married allowance	3455	3655

Bands eg

30^r rate	0-16200	0-17200

60^	over 40200 over 42700

The total revenue costs of indexation of income tax (reflected in the forecast) are   1140m in 1986-87, and El490m in a full year, at forecast 1986-87 prices and incomes.

B Indirect Taxes: Indexation

The effects of 5.7 per cent revalorisation of the exercise duties (including VAT effects, price changes rounded) are as follows:

Revenue effect

THE TAX BURDEN

Since the Government came to power total taxes and NICs as a proportion of GDP at market has risen by about 5 percentage points, though the ratio has fallen slightly since 1981-8?. The figures are as follows:

Table 1

Total taxation* as a % of GDP (market prices)

1978-	79	33.9

1979-	80	35.?

1980-	81	36.4

1981-	8?	39.3

198?   83	39.1

1983-	84	38.6

1984-	85	39.?

1985-	86 (estimate)	38.7

1986-	87 (assuming indexation) 38.6

*	Including NICs and the local authority rates.

Personal sector

?. Despite reductions in income tax, total personal taxes (direct and indirect, including employees&apos; NIC and domestic rates) in 1985-86 are about   15 billion higher in real terms (ie 1985-86 prices) than they were in 1978-79. For income tax and national insurance contributions the following table shows how the proportion of gross pay they represent has risen, particularly for the low paid:

Table ?

1986-	87 (indexation)	19.3	29.1	31.7

*	Adult male earnings (all occupations). Married couple, wife not working: the couple are assumed to have no children, to avoid distortion of the figures from the abolition of child tax allowances.


   3.	These figures reflect the rise in the standard employees&apos; NIC rate from 6}^f to 9^. The lower rates introduced in the 1985 Finance Act do not affect the cases shown. So far as income tax is concerned, personal allowances have increased by over 19^ in real terms since 1978-79 and have increased slightly faster than earnings. The basic rate has been reduced from 33p to 30p, but the 25p reduced rate band has been abolished.

4.	As the table shows, indexation of allowances in the Budget would lead to a very slight rise in the proportion of incomes taken in tax and NIC. This is because earnings are assumed to rise by 1% compared with the indexation percentage of S.T%.

5.	Since 1978-79 total taxes paid by businesses (outside the North Sea) have fallen slightly as a percentage of GDP. Within this total, the major change has been a fall in employers&apos; NIC and NIS as a percentage of GDP, partially offset by an increase in business rates, and &apos;other&apos; taxes as the following table shows:

Taxes paid by businesses   bn in 1985-86 prices (figures in brackets are ^rs of GDP)
