   3.	I have also given consideration to ways of reducing the risks of the k CE project. Mr Sherwood is willing to commence this project with a trial J^bored tunnel through the difficult ground on the French side, keeping open (^%he possibility of reverting to a CTG-type shuttle project if the

technical difficulties of constructing large tunnels proved too great. ^HB^this would not represent a clear decision to proceed with a single ^poject, and there would also be difficulties of law and propriety in a^Prog CE to fall back to another promoter&apos;s project.

4.	I have also asked CTG whether they could improve their offer by adding drive   through tunnels to their scheme at a later date if traffic increases and if technical uncertainties are resolved to the point that such an ext^kion becomes financeable. CTG have not yet offered any commitmenAX%his, but I am trying to extract some undertaking by suggesting vBfhh&amp;ii that it would help them to be selected.

5.	I held a^fijjW%r meeting with the French Transport Minister on Monday, who is ^ui^^^king on the basis of instructions from the French President. Pre^2eK%Mitterrand is very anxious for a final decision on 20 January; his f^^B^fcoice would be EuroRoute, and his second CTG. The French say that the^fJB^iot prepared to contemplate the delay involved in a proper test of the^^^^d^cial market between CTG and CE, a concept which they still seem unableto comprehend. CE remains entirely unacceptable to the French for reasons miich are not quite clear. They have doubts about the practicality of the scheme, as well as disliking Mr Sherwood personally. They could accept him as the operator of CTG&apos;s shuttle trains.

6.	I do not believe we have	option other than one of the

following:

a.	To accept CTG, after obtSh^^ltfrom them the best possible

undertakings we can about ^^:er provision of drive-through capacity. (My officials are^i^issing with the French possible conditions which we might put ^o	)

b.	To insist on CE, or on putting nBa^ce between CE and CTG to the financial markets to decide.

7.	Option a is regarded by both us and the French as the lowest common denominator. We would be criticised for not choosing a drive-through option - public opinion in the United Kingdom appears to be in favour of a drive   through Link. We would also be accused of rushinA^bhe decision and caving in to the French in order to help the French SAcia^ist Party&apos;s electoral ambitions.

8.	Option b involves being prepared to see the postponement of the

announcement of the decision on 20 January in Lille. The ^^^i^^Minister, summing up on 8 January agreed that a decision of this magironji^^hould not be constrained by a very limited timescale. The French	great

store on the announcement being made on 20 January. It is pod^U^M^^hat they would give way to us if we pushed them to the limit. If	not

give way to us, postponement would be damaging to them but we wowc oe


   applauded for refusing to be rushed into what the public generally regard % as the wrong decision. But this option obviously opens up the possibility ^|bf no agreement being reached in the foreseeable future, and of no Link fming built within our timescale.

^5^CWa1 though it is a risky course, my preference is for insisting on CE.

that the French would ultimately find a way either of accepting CE^^^at least agreeing a market test.

10.	There are a number of points, including those raised by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, that we are trying to get the French and the promoters to accept while we still have negotiating leverage. The most important ora.kese is the arrangement for the procurement, operation and revenue-sh^J^f high-speed through trains by a joint venture of BR and

SNCF.

PH In these SircuTjSstances it is impossible to produce the White Paper by January 20, altll^W^ am continuing to work on it so far as possible. I believe it   bette^to^oduce a really good document once the decision has

been taken.

SCHOOL TEACHERS&apos; PAY

mm

Memc^r^^djim by the Secretary of State for Education and Science

A provisional agreement has been reached, under the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) conciliation, in the England and Wales teachers&apos; disputey^?he main elements are:

i.	a pay rnfcreajke from 1 April 1985 of 6.9 per cent, rising to 8.5 per cent fr^fc^J^diarch 1986;

ii.	an end to ai/jpw&amp;ion;

iii.	an ACAS-managed	iation for 1986 across pay and other

conditions of service Q&amp;  sypropose to appoint three individuals to &quot;assist&quot; the negotiationAXX/^\

2.	The provisional agreement iSs&apos;op&apos;ftween the management and teachers&apos; sides of the Burnham Primary andN^ramp^ary Committee. Agreement to formal adoption is now being sought on bot/tf^J&amp;es through consultation with all Local Education Authorities (LEAs) and^ixthin the unions. This process is expected to take 3-4 weeks, mainly becaj^e the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers p^otSa^es to ballot its membership. The National Union of Teachers (NUT) (theyTiartest union but now a minority within the teachers&apos; side of Burnham) is party to the provisional agreement, and may continue disruption evei^if the deal is formally adopted and implemented.

3.	An end to disruption in the schools is urgearfy^needed. There are two snags about the agreement itself. The first its K/ie cost. The second is the probability that the resulting 1986 negotia^j^Jr^kill fail to deliver the Government&apos;s objectives of a better payU^Tputrure linked with the clarification of teachers&apos; duties.

Government Response

4.	The Ministerial Group on Teachers&apos; Pay (MISC 122) has ramdVdered how we should respond to this agreement. We have no power to prwgajr^the 1985 pay increase. But there can be no question of making additionaiT^fcources available for teachers&apos; pay except within the publicly offered

million for 1986-90 on the stated conditions. The LEAs must thex^Sor^ face the financial consequences of the 1985 increase themselves. W|  &apos;eMld


   seek to substitute our own inquiry or review for the ACAS-managed 1986 ^Negotiation, with our choice of membership and terms of reference. In ^^kinciple this could be the l  n8 term route to a satisfactory pay and ({duties outcome, but its immediate outcome would almost certainly be an end provisional agreement and the continuation of disruption, for which ^  ^rrauld be blamed.

122 therefore agreed that we should allow the ACAS process to proc  ed^^oiding any action that could enable us to be blamed if it should fail, ^mjp^fclear public position should be:

!   lcome for the prospect of an end to disruption;

ii.	Van expectation that if the deal is formally adopted then the NUT will also end disruption;

iii.	no extta~&gt;resources for 1985-86. The Government&apos;s willingness

to provide e/ttr^resources within the   1,250 million for 1986-87 and later depends^o^wtcomes from negotiations satisfying Government conditions.	Jj

6.	If the agreement	adopted then Department of Education and

Science officials will	to be minority members of the management

side of the ACAS-managed&lt;*t&gt;^i&amp;Negotiations. They will ensure that the Government&apos;s objectives, and  ^i&amp;i. conditions attached to the   1,250 million, are fully understoqrfK^n

7.	I invite Cabinet to endor^^^^s conclusion The Longer Term

8.	The ACAS-managed future work ma$Kruj*&gt;into the sand either before

formal adoption or at any subsequent	It is therefore right to

develop other options in case they becSojC^icessary. I propose to keep under review the possibility of setting ^  /^feovernment inquiry or moving directly to the establishment of a new stv(utory review body for teachers&apos; pay and conditions of service (legislationSiould be required for the latter) and to develop these options through MISC 122.

9.	I invite Cabinet to note this proposed acti/Ml7S\

Scotland	))

10.	The ACAS exercise does not directly affect the Rjwitwn in Scotland,

but any new Government initiative in Scotland before t|^  $cXS agreement is formally adopted could hinder the adoption process. Th^S^cwetary of State for Scotland will shortly be putting proposals to	for

possible implementation once the ACAS deal is secure.
