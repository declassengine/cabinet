CABINET

&amp;	CHANNEL FIXED LINK

X* y the Secretary of State for Transport

The Sub-Committee on^j  W^iic Affairs of the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic^K^a^gy (E(A)), in considering the Channel Fixed Link on 8 January (E(AA^^%nd Meeting), invited me to explore the possibility of collaboraffon between the Channel Tunnel Group (CTG) and Channel Expressway (CE) and also between EuroRoute and CE. The objective was to establish whether a drive-through capability could be maintained with the CE scheme put on a more reliable basis by inclusion of one or both of the more established group^in the project. This note reports on the results of this initiative, illl further developments including a further meeting with the French	of Transport.

2.	Over the period 8-10 January I^^^wo meetings with Sir Nicholas Henderson of CTG, and one each with M  ^TO  ood of CE and Sir Nigel Broackes of EuroRoute. Telephone disciSsijW| continued over the weekend.

a.	CTG have robustly defended their	in terms of its appeal

to the traveller, its low risks atm ^ts ^inanceability, and have refused outright to collaborate wit^^E or EuroRoute. They have themselves examined a drive   through tunnel scheme and have concluded that at   4.2 billion (including a single rail tunnel) it would be unfinanceable, but they have offered to consider building one later if it appears to them feas^^e and justifiable.

b.	The only collaboration that EuroRoute were pre^l^^to envisage with CE was that CE could act as the operator ol^the iuroRoute project after it was opened.

c.	CE would be prepared to co-operate in one way or an^^mgmn.th either CTG or EuroRoute.

On this information, I have concluded that there is no scope to b^n^ t^ groups together.
