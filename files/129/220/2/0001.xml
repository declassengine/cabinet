   ANNUAL REVIEW OF AGRICULTURE 1986 INTRODUCTION

1.	This White Paper sets out the data considered during the Annual Review of the economic condition and prospects of the United Kingdom agricultural industry. The Government will draw on this information when considering proposals by the European Commission for agricultural support in 1986/87 and when taking decisions on national support arrangements. In most cases the forecasts for 1985 were made in November 1985.

PART I   STATE OF THE INDUSTRY

2.	Most sectors of the agricultural industry experienced special difficulty during 1985 largely because of the poor weather conditions. Scotland, Northern Ireland and the hill and upland areas of Wales and northern England were particularly badly affected by unusually heavy rainfall with very few dry days and sunshine and temperatures significantly below normal. The poor weather severely interfered with hay-making and the provision of winter feed thereby seriously affecting, the livestock sector. Arable farming throughout the country was also affected. For example, average yields of cereals in 1985 were 16% below those in 1984; in addition, the quality of the crop was reduced.

3.	Prices received by farmers averaged 2V2% less in 1985 than in 1984 because of lower prices for many farm crops. The average level of prices paid by the industry for goods and services increased by under 1%. At current prices, farming income   the return to farmers and their spouses for their labour, management and own capital invested   fell 43% following the increase of 35% in 1984. Farm business income, an alternative and broader-based measure, declined by 25%, again following a substantial increase in 1984. These sharp declines in the industry   s aggregate income position are attributable to the effects of the very wet summer, including substantially increased cereal harvesting and drying costs, and to a rise in costs together with weaker product prices.

4.	The total area planted to cereals declined only marginally but forecast production fell by 16% from last year   s exceptionally high level, to 22.3 million tonnes. The area sown to oilseed rape increased by 10% to 296,000 hectares but compared with 1984, production is forecast to decline by almost 3x/2% to 891,000 tonnes. Potato production fell overall by over 7% to 6.8 million tonnes due in almost equal measure to reduced area and reduced yields. The area of sugar beet harvested is forecast to be slightly higher than last year and the yield of sugar per hectare to decrease by about 13% on last year   s high figure, but at some 1.2 million tonnes sugar production will again exceed the United Kingdom   s quota.

5.	The national cattle breeding herd declined by about 3Vi% reflecting a 4Vi% drop in the dairy herd and a fall of almost 1% in the number of beef


   cattle. Because average milk yield per cow rose by 3%, milk production during the year is expected to fall by about only 1%. The sheep breeding flock increased by nearly ll/i% while sheepmeat production in 1985 is expected to rise by 3%. The national breeding pig herd grew by over 4%, and the total pig herd by 2V2%. Pigmeat production during 1985 is forecast to expand by almost 3% to 989,000 tonnes. Egg production is expected to show a slight increase and poultrymeat production to rise by 3Vi% to 875,000 tonnes.

PART II   GENERAL DEVELOPMENTS Farm structure (Table 4)

6.	In 1985 there were some 240,300 farm holdings in the United Kingdom. This is a reduction of V/i% on the number in 1980, the decline being concentrated among the smaller full-time businesses. It is estimated that some 90% of total output came from businesses capable of providing work for at least one full-time man and that these represented just under half the total number of holdings. Large businesses of 1,000 standard man-days or more, whilst only about 12% of the total number of holdings, accounted for about half the total output. In Northern Ireland and Wales, the output from small-scale farms is proportionately more significant than in other parts of the United Kingdom.

7.	The average area (including rough grazing) of full-time businesses of 250 standard man-days or more is now nearly 125 hectares compared with about 117 hectares in 1980. The increasing specialisation and the decline in the number of holdings continues and so the average sizes of enterprises has tended to increase. There has been a reduction in the last five years of about 10% in the number of holdings growing cereals whilst the average size of cereal enterprises has risen by about 14%. Over the same period the number of holdings producing potatoes and sugar beet has declined by 20% and 13% respectively. Holdings growing oilseed rape have, however, more than trebled in the last five years. The average pig breeding herd has continued to increase in size and is now 47 sows compared with 34 sows in 1980. During the same period the number of holdings with breeding sows has fallen by 28% and those with fattening pigs by a quarter. Conversely the number of holdings with breeding sheep increased by 6% between 1980 and 1985.

8.	In Great Britain 70% of holdings were wholly or mainly owner-occupied in 1985 compared with 54% in 1960/61. The proportion of agricultural land which is farmed by its owner has increased from 52% in 1960/61 to 61% in 1985. In Northern Ireland virtually all farmers are owner-occupiers.

    Output (Tables 22 and 24)

9.	Gross output is forecast to fall by   667 million (5%) in 1985 after having risen by   933 million (8%) in 1984. The overall volume of gross output, measured at constant 1980 prices, is expected to be 3% lower than


   last year. This decline is principally attributable to the smaller cereals harvest in 1985. Prices paid to farmers in 1985 are expected to average 2V2% less than in 1984 largely due to lower prices for farm crops. A particularly large decrease of 52% was recorded for potatoes. The overall pattern of sales off farms, valued at current prices, is forecast to show the following changes between 1984 and 1985: sales of farm crops down by 11%; horticultural items down by 1%; livestock and livestock products up by 1% and 1Vi% respectively.

Input (Table 22)

10.	Gross input costs are expected to fall by   89 million (1V2%) in 1985 compared with the increase of   209 million (3%) in 1984. The volume of material inputs used is forecast to decrease by 2% in 1985, with reductions in feedingstuffs and fertilisers being only partly offset by increased fuel usage, particularly for drying cereals. Average prices paid by farmers for bought-in goods and services rose by less than 1%. A fall of 6% for feed   much the largest input item   balanced increases of 13% for fuel and 9% for machinery repairs. Expenditure on feedingstuffs is expected to fall by 9% while that on fuel, machinery repairs and seeds is expected to rise by 24%, 10% and over 5% respectively.

Gross and net product (Tables 22 and 23)

11.	Gross product, which is gross output minus gross input, is forecast to be   5,418 million in 1985, a decrease of 10% on the 1984 figure. After allowing for depreciation on fixed assets, net product (the measure of net value added by the agricultural industry to all goods and services purchased from outside the sector) is expected to fall by   640 million (14%), compared with the increase of   680 million (17%) between 1983 and 1984.

Aggregate income (Tables 22 and 23)

12.	The net product of agriculture represents the sum of various types of income. From it, the agricultural industry has to pay its labour force, meet interest charges on outstanding debt and provide for expenditure on net rent; the residual provides the return to farmers and their spouses for their own labour, management and capital invested. This residual is termed Farming Income.

13.	The labour bill for hired and family workers is expected to rise by   100 million (5%) in 1985. Net rent increased by   12 million (8%) while interest payments are expected to increase by   127 million (22%), reflecting higher interest rates in particular. Farming income is thus forecast to fall by   879 million (43%) to   1,154 million in 1985, compared with the increase of   525 million (35%) now recorded between 1983 and 1984. It should be noted that Farming Income is calculated as the difference between the two large aggregates of output and expenditure. A small proportionate change in either can produce a large fluctuation in the income indicator. Additionally, calendar year income measures cannot be directly related to the correspond-


   ing year   s harvest. This is because the output valuation includes substantial sales of cereals and potatoes carried over from the previous year   s crop; it is also affected by changes in the quantity of harvested crops in store on farms at the end of each year   cereal stocks, for example, increased by 17% in 1984 but fell by 23% in 1985. Farming Income series, in money and real terms, are shown in column (6) of Tables 23 A and 23B.

14.	There are several other measures of the industry   s income which are more broadly based and less volatile than Farming Income. For example, Farm Business Income (column (c) of Table 23 A) also includes the returns to non-principal farmers and directors and the returns on all capital invested (own or borrowed). In 1985 Farm Business Income fell by 25% having risen by 27%in 1984.

15.	Column (d) in Table 23A presents a measure of the cash flow of farmers and their spouses. The index shows farmers    and spouses    receipts (including capital grants) less cash outlays on material inputs and services and on capital items. As such, this measure may be close to how many farmers might perceive their financial situation. Between 1984 and 1985, cash flow is estimated to have fallen by 22% after having risen by 33% between 1983 and

1984.

Income developments by farm type (Tables 26 and 27)

16.	Information relating to the incomes of farm businesses, according to farm type and size, is based upon accounts data from samples of full-time farm businesses in each of the four countries of the United Kingdom. Accounting concepts and practices differ from the aggregate calculation so that the two cannot be compared directly. Results for the accounting year 1984/85 (ending on average in February 1985) show increases in incomes on specialist cereal, pig and poultry, and hill and upland livestock farms, falls on lowland livestock farms and general cropping farms and little change on dairy farms. Forecasts for 1985/86 suggest that incomes will fall for most types of farm throughout the United Kingdom, with particularly severe reductions in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

17.	Dairy farm incomes showed little change overall between 1983/84 and 1984/85, despite the introduction of milk quotas in 1984. Substantial economies were made in the use of purchased feed thereby largely offsetting the effects of reduced milk output. In 1985/86 incomes on dairy farms are forecast to fall on average with a small increase in England but reductions in the other countries.

18.	On hill and upland livestock farms incomes recovered somewhat in 198.4/85, following two years of decline. In 1985/86, however, incomes on these farms, particularly in Scotland and Northern Ireland, are expected to show marked falls despite increases in hill livestock compensatory allowances and payments under the exceptional weather aid scheme to farmers in certain areas. These falls are largely because of substantial increases in purchased feed requirements resulting from the wet summer weather of 1985. On lowland livestock farms, incomes are also forecast to fall further in 1985/86,


   following reductions in the past three years. On pig and poultry farms incomes in 1985/86 are likely to fall back somewhat, following a very large increase between 1983/84 and 1984/85 but, given lower cereal prices, it seems likely that incomes will remain at a relatively high level.

19.	With a record cereal harvest in 1984, incomes on cereal farms showed a substantial increase in 1984/85. In 1985/86, however, given lower cereal yields and higher harvesting costs, it is forecast that incomes on these farms will fall considerably. On other cropping farms, given the downward yield movements of cereals, potatoes and most other crops in 1985, incomes seem set to fall in 1985/86.

20.	The overall impression conveyed by farm accounts information is therefore one of a decline in incomes in 1985/86 in money and real terms, with changes due largely to the effects of weather on yields in the case of cropping farms and on purchased feed costs for many livestock farms.

Productivity (Tables 5 and 24)

21.	The index of gross agricultural product at constant prices per whole-time man equivalent reflects changes in, for example, plant and animal breeding, improvements in the organization of farming, as well as changes in the number of persons engaged and short-term movements in output caused by factors such as weather. During the ten years to 1984 the index, although fluctuating from year to year, increased on average by over 7% annually. Following an exceptional increase of some 17% in 1984, it is forecast to fall by about 3% in 1985. This decline results from a decrease of almost 4% in gross agricultural product at constant prices being only partially offset by the small fall in the volume of labour input. Although the number of regular whole-time workers fell by 2V4% between 1984 and 1985, this was less than the average annual reduction of about 4% in the ten years to 1984. Numbers of part-time and seasonal and casual workers increased respectively by 2% and 3% between 1984 and 1985.

22.	An alternative measure of productivity may be obtained by comparing changes in the volume of gross output with those in the volume of productive inputs employed, including labour, usage of capital items and material inputs. Provisional calculations suggest that this indicator rose by an average of around 3% per annum over the last decade, and 7\h% per annum over the last five years.


   capital formation in United Kingdom agriculture is forecast to fall by about

12%.

24.	As a result of the decline in numbers of breeding cattle, the value of investment in breeding livestock fell in 1985. There was also a decrease in the value of work-in-progress, again due to reductions in cattle numbers.

Bank borrowings

25.	Bank advances to agriculture in 1985 are forecast to be on average about   5,520 million, 5% more than in 1984. The rate of increase in bank borrowing is, however, less than that between 1983 and 1984 and the relationship between liabilities and assets remains sound for the majority of farm businesses. Information from the balance sheets of a sample of full-time farm businesses in England suggests that, at the end of the 1984/85 farm survey year, external liabilities were equivalent to about one quarter of the total business assets of tenanted farms, about one tenth of the assets of owner-occupied farms and about one seventh of the assets of mixed tenure farms.

Agricultural land prices (Table 25)

26.	The price of agricultural land sold with vacant possession in England has continued to rise in recent years and reached an average of   4,058 per hectare in 1984 according to the comprehensive series produced by the Inland Revenue. In Wales and Scotland however, prices fell slightly from their 1983 levels to   2,653 per hectare and   1,942 per hectare respectively. The price in Northern Ireland rose to   2,958 per hectare, a small increase over 1983. Indications are that land prices in England have weakened during 1985.

27.	Tenanted agricultural land prices rose sharply in England to reach   2,835 per hectare in 1984; reliable figures for Wales and Scotland are not available.

Farm rents (Table 25)

28.	The provisional results of the annual rent enquiry in England and Wales and the continuing field surveys in Scotland reveal that average farm rents will have increased by 6% in 1985 compared with 1984. Between 1983 and 1984 there was an increase of 11%.

Farm workers    earnings (Table 21)

29.	The average weekly earnings of whole-time hired men in the United Kingdom were   122.59 for 46.2 hours in 1984 compared with   116.57 for 46.5 hours in 1983. Average weekly earnings in 1985 are forecast to be about   131.60 for 46.3 hours. Following the increases in minimum weekly wage rates that came into effect in June, August and September 1984 (paragraph 27 of the 1985 Annual Review White Paper (Cmnd. 9423)), statutory minimum weekly wage rates were increased by 8.3% for adult regular whole-time hired


   workers in England and Wales from 2 June 1985, by 7.2% for general workers in Scotland from 2 September 1985 and by 8.3% for agricultural workers in Northern Ireland from 16 September 1985.

Public expenditure (Table 28)

30.	Expenditure in the United Kingdom on market regulation under the Common Agricultural Policy is estimated to be about   1,893 million in 1985/86 compared with some   1,377 million in 1984/85. This expenditure includes the school milk subsidy, the beef and sheepmeat variable premium schemes, the premium schemes for the non-marketing of milk and for the conversion of dairy herds, the suckler cow premium scheme, the annual premium on ewes, the oilseed crushing subsidy, animal feed subsidies, private storage aids, export refunds and the cost of purchasing and storing commodities taken into intervention, less proceeds from sales. Some of this expenditure benefits consumers and trade interests rather than producers. Receipts from the milk co-responsibility and supplementary levies, export charges equivalent to the variable premium on sheepmeat (known as    clawback   ), charges on beef exported and sold into intervention and levies on intra-community trade have been netted off against this expenditure.

31.	The additional expenditure in 1985/86 is mainly due to increased purchases into intervention of cereals, butter and beef, to increased expenditure on the oilseed crushing subsidy and the annual premium on ewes (because of a change in the marketing year) and to lower sales of butter and skimmed milk powder. These increases are partly offset by reduced purchases into intervention of skimmed milk powder, by increased sales from intervention of cereals and beef, by reduced payments on the sheep variable premium and on the consumer butter subsidy (which has now ended).

32.	Other expenditure on agricultural support in the United Kingdom including price guarantees, capital grants and assistance for special areas is estimated to be   322 million in 1985/86 compared with   338 million in 1984/85. This expenditure includes the   16.9 million special aid package announced in November 1985 to assist those livestock farmers seriously affected by the exceptionally bad weather conditions in 1985.

PART III   COMMODITY TRENDS Cereals (Tables 3,6, 8 and 29)

33.	In 1985, cereals were grown on 4.02 million hectares, a net decrease of 16,000 hectares compared with 1984. The area sown to wheat was down by 39,000 hectares and barley by 9,000 hectares. The area under oats and rye increased by 30,000 and 2,000 hectares respectively. Yields were well down on last year   s record levels and production of all cereals is estimated at 22.3 million tonnes, a fall of 4.3 million tonnes but still the second largest harvest. Average quality, particularly of milling wheat, was low.


   34.	Prices during the first half of 1985 were generally lower than in the same period of 1984 and reflected the increased supplies available from the record 1984 harvest. New crop wheat prices in August opened at very low levels but soon firmed for spot sales because of the delayed harvest. Forward prices remained below last year   s levels. The quality of wheat and barley was affected by wet weather at harvest time. Supplies of wheat of breadmaking quality from the 1985 harvest were below normal levels and obtained high prices. Additional supplies of wheat were imported from North America and France reducing the percentage of home grown wheat used by millers from 82% in the first half of the year to around 75%. Offers into intervention of feed wheat and barley totalled 2.2 million tonnes to the end of November. Total stocks in intervention were 6.3 million tonnes.

Oilseed rape (Tables 3,6, 9 and 29)

35.	The area sown with oilseed rape in 1985 increased by 10% to 296,000 hectares. As with other arable crops average yields are down on last year   s level, at 3.01 tonnes per hectare. Production is estimated at 891,000 tonnes. A further small increase in the area sown for 1986 can be expected despite the difficult conditions experienced by producers in 1985. Prices have remained well above the intervention level.

Potatoes (Tables 3,6,10 and 29)

36.	Plantings in 1985 were broadly in line with the United Kingdom target area of 191,500 hectares. Planting and growing conditions were extremely variable, with wet, cool weather predominating for much of the season. Despite this, yields from the early crop were high, resulting in a surplus of new potatoes. Although maincrop yields were down on last year   s record levels, supplies have been plentiful and consequently prices fairly low. The Potato Marketing Board was again authorised to offer contracts pre-season to producers in Great Britain for a proportion of their crop with the aim of ensuring stability in the market throughout the season; almost 418,000 tonnes of potatoes were placed under contract in this way. In addition, under the revised support arrangements which came into effect on 1 July 1985, the Board has at its disposal the power to intervene directly in the market, provided that total intervention does not exceed 500,000 tonnes. Direct intervention began in July in an attempt to arrest the slump in prices which resulted from the early market surplus.

Sugar beet (Tables 3, 6,11 and 29)

37.	The tonnage of sugar beet which farmers contracted to grow in 1985 represented an area of about 206,000 hectares, slightly more than in 1984. The harvested area will probably be around 200,000 hectares, about 4,000 hectares more than last year. Weather during the early part of the growing season was unfavourable and planting was delayed. Later in the year the weather improved resulting in a higher than average sugar content in the beet. White sugar production is forecast to be about 1.2 million tonnes


   compared with 1.31 million tonnes the previous year. Including 50,000 tonnes of white sugar produced in excess of quotas carried forward from the previous marketing year, total outturn is again expected to exceed the maximum quota of 1.144 million tonnes set for the United Kingdom under the Community sugar regime. The excess has to be exported without export refunds or carried forward to the next quota year.

Horticulture (Tables 3, 6,12 and 29)

38.	It is not practicable to deal individually with the whole range of horticultural crops grown commercially in the United Kingdom. These paragraphs concentrate on certain crops in significant production here including those subject to Community internal market arrangements (apples, pears, cauliflowers and tomatoes).

39.	The area devoted to horticulture in 1985 was about 226,000 hectares compared with 218,000 hectares in 1984, an increase of 3%%. This is mainly due to an increase in the area devoted to field vegetables.

40.	Production of dessert apples in 1985 was lower than in 1984, particularly so for Cox. Fruit size and quality were also poorer. The Bramley crop was 23% below last year   s level but still above the average of the last five years. Pear production increased slightly with Comice giving the best crop in several years. Production of plums was substantially down on the 1984 level. Soft fruit production was also down on last year with Scottish raspberry yields being severely affected by the extreme weather conditions. Quality was also poorer with Botrytis on strawberries causing some losses.

41.	Despite the increased area, output of field vegetables has generally been similar to last year. Quality is good and supplies are expected to be ample. The cool summer weather and increased use of modern propagation techniques resulted in a good quality cauliflower crop over a more extended season. But the poor weather meant that growers of glasshouse crops had to face higher fuel costs. Yields of tomatoes were slightly down on 1984 and there was again strong competition from imported produce.

42.	Prices of apples remained below 1984 levels throughout the early part of the year because of the large quantities in store. The poor summer affected the quality of the new season   s fruit but prices started above the previous year   s level, with better quality fruit commanding a higher premium. For pears, prices in the first half of the year were similar to those in 1984 but for the new season crop prices increased. Withdrawals of 1984 season apples and pears were higher than for the previous year   s crop. For cauliflowers the cold conditions at the beginning of the year resulted in short supplies with prices even higher than the comparable period of 1984. Prices returned to more usual levels thereafter when supplies were plentiful and again large quantities were withdrawn. The poor summer led to a lower than normal demand for salad vegetables with tomato prices in July and August low for that time of year. Imports of cut flowers increased with supplies from the Netherlands continuing to dominate the market. Flowers were of better quality and prices increased.


   Hops (Tables 3, 6,13 and 29)

43.	There was another substantial reduction of nearly 400 hectares in the area under hops. Production also declined but, as large stocks are held by brewers, supplies will still be more than enough to meet contracts. Low non-contract prices led to a sharp drop in average returns. The quality of this season   s crop was adversely affected by the wet weather.

Seeds (Table 14)

44.	The area approved in 1985 for production of certified herbage and legume seed (excluding field bean and field pea seed) was slightly higher than that for 1984. Adverse weather conditions resulted in lower than average yields but quality appears not to have been seriously affected. Stocks of herbage seed were marginally higher than in the previous year. Prices to seed growers are expected to show little change compared with 1984 although returns may be lower because of the reduction in yields.

45.	The area approved in 1985 for certified field bean and field pea seed increased substantially but, for field pea seed in particular, there is unlikely to be a corresponding increase in the weight of seed harvested because of the adverse weather conditions.

Dried peas and beans

46.	The area sown with peas in 1985 is estimated at 91,000 hectares an increase of 64% over last year   s final figure but yields at 3.06 tonnes per hectare were significantly lower than last year. For beans the area sown was 45,500 hectares, an increase of 40% on 1984. Yields for beans at 3.44 tonnes per hectare were also lower than last year.

47.	The lower than expected yields have meant that, despite variable quality, prices have been somewhat higher than the minimum producer price specified in the Community aid scheme for peas and beans.

Beef and milk (Tables 3, 6,15,16,17 and 29)

48.	The June census showed a decline of 3Vz% in the total United Kingdom cattle breeding herd compared with the previous year. There was a reduction of less than 1% in the size of the United Kingdom beef breeding herd while the dairy herd, which accounts for about 70% of all breeding cows, fell by about 4V2% as dairy producers continued to reduce their milk production in response to milk quotas. But the number of dairy heifers in-calf rose, by just over 2% for the first time in four years. Within the national dairy herd the decline in the number of dairy cows was around the United Kingdom average in England, Scotland and Wales but was rather less in Northern Ireland. The national dairy herd is expected to decline further in 1986.

49.	Home-fed production of beef in 1985 is expected to be about 1V2% lower than in 1984. Exports are forecast to be down by almost 7%, compared with the record levels of 1984, and imports to be up by about 2V  %, giving


   total new supplies for home consumption of 1.13 million tonnes, slightly above the 1984 total. Production is estimated to represent 99% of the total new supply. Average market prices for certified cattle started the year at 97p/live kg declining to under 94p/live kg in March and rising to over 99p/live kg in May. Prices remained steady at around 95p/live kg during the summer and then declined seasonally to 91-92p/live kg in September and October. Variable premium was paid at the maximum rate virtually throughout the year. Total intervention purchases during the year were over 55,000 tonnes representing about 5% of forecast total new supplies. Over 70% of intervention purchases took place in Northern Ireland.

50.	The average yield of milk per cow in 1985 is expected to be about 3% higher than in 1984 as producers have adapted their management systems to cope with quotas. However, because of the fall in the dairy herd, total milk production in 1985 is expected to be more than 1% lower than in 1984. With reduced supplies of milk available it is expected that there will be a fall of more than 1% in the volume of milk available for manufacturing. Milk used for cheese production is expected to increase by about 3% while milk used for butter production is expected to decrease by about lxh%.

51.	Producers    returns for milk are determined by the Milk Marketing Boards on the basis of their returns from the liquid and manufacturing milk markets. The average net return to producers in each of the five United Kingdom Milk Marketing Board areas for all milk for the 1985/86 year is expected to range between 14.06 ppl and 16.1 ppl. Returns to producers in England and Wales are expected to be around 15.3 ppl whereas in Scotland the average over the three Board areas will be slightly higher at 16.0 ppl and in Northern Ireland below the average at 14.06 ppl. In 1984/85 average returns to producers in the United Kingdom ranged between 14.5 ppl and

14.7	ppl.

Sheep and wool (Tables 3,15,19 and 29)

52.	The breeding flock continued to expand with an increase of just under ll/i% between June 1984 and June 1985; this is a slightly lower increase than in the previous year.

53.	Home-fed production of sheepmeat is forecast to be around 3% higher in 1985 than 1984. This reflects another good lambing season and a large carry-over of lambs from 1984 following changes to the seasonal scale of guide prices. Total supplies to the home market are expected to increase in 1985 by about 2V2%. The growth of home-production accounts for much of the increase; quantities of imports and exports are expected to be similar to those in 1984. Market prices in Great Britain have been, on average, about 3% above those of 1984 but in Northern Ireland around 2% lower.

54.	Sheep variable premium was paid in Great Britain in every week of

1985.	Annual premium payments relating to the 1984/85 marketing year amounted to   4.68 per ewe in Great Britain and   14.99 per ewe in Northern Ireland where variable premium is not payable. Average prices for store


   lambs continued to rise in England and particularly in Wales but fell slightly in Scotland and significantly in Northern Ireland. Draft ewe prices increased throughout the United Kingdom except in Northern Ireland where they fell substantially.

55.	Wool production in 1985 is forecast to be about 5% higher than in 1984 and, at 41 million kg, is comparable with the previous record clip in 1983. The guaranteed price was increased by 9p/kg to 129p/kg for the 1985 clip. Exchequer advances became necessary in August 1985 when the average market price fell below the guaranteed price for the first time in two years.

Pigs (Tables 3,15 and 29)

56.	Pigmeat production in 1985 is expected to be about 3% above the

1984	level. As a result of the higher numbers of home-produced pigs, prices in

1985	averaged 4V  % below 1984 levels. Feedstuffs costs were also lower, so margins, although reduced, remained positive on average. The breeding herd now appears to have stabilised for the present and is forecast to decrease in

1986.

Poultrymeat (Tables 3,15 and 29)

57.	Poultrymeat output in 1985 is expected to be 3V  % above the level of the previous year. This reflects an increase of about 4% in broiler meat production and an increase of 1% in turkey meat. Further increases are forecast in 1986 for broiler output and turkey meat production. Chicken prices for 1985 are expected to show a fall of nearly 5% over 1984 levels while turkey prices are forecast to show an increase of about 7% over 1984 prices.

Eggs (Tables 3, 6,18 and 29)

58.	The laying flock is expected to fall slightly in 1985 with a further small reduction forecast for 1986. Imports of eggs in shell during 1985 are expected to remain at approximately the same levels as for the previous year, and again the United Kingdom will be a net importer. The trend of greater egg yields has continued with an increase of about 3 eggs per bird in 1985 and a further increase of 2 eggs projected for 1986. Supplies for consumption are consequently expected to be slightly higher than in 1984 in spite of the reduction in the laying flock. The average packer to producer price for 1985 is expected to be below the previous year   s level.


   APPENDIX

STATISTICAL TABLES

The tables cover largely the same ground as those in last year   s White Paper. Some of the figures in this appendix differ from those in previous Annual Review White Papers because of later information, changes in the scope and nature of available data and improvements in statistical methods, although there has been no change in the basis of the tables. The forecasts for 1985 generally reflect the position up to the end of the year, as seen at November 1985.

All figures relate to the United Kingdom, unless otherwise stated.

Figures for imports and exports to the Nine relate throughout to the other countries of the European Community (Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Greece, the Irish Republic, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands).

Significant items of Channel Islands    trade are shown separately in the tables.

Figures for exports include re-exports.

In some cases figures may not add up to the totals shown because of roundings.

   Table 3 (continued)

(a) The data in this table vary between the different countries as follows:   

England and Wales: For all years the figures relate to all known agricultural holdings including minor holdings.

Scotland: From 1974 the figures relate to all known agricultural holdings with 40 smd or more. (A standard man-day (smd) represents 8 hours    productive work by an adult worker under average conditions.) Prior to June 1977 following the 1976 minor holdings census 1,700 holdings were transferred from the main to the minor category.

Northern Ireland: From 1974 to 1980 the figures relate to all known agricultural holdings with (i) 40 smd or more, or (ii) 4 hectares or more of total area, or (iii) one or more full-time workers, excluding the owner. The figures for 1981 onwards relate to all known holdings with: (i) one European Size Unit (ESU) or more, or (ii) 6 hectares or more of total area, or (iii) one or more full-time workers, excluding the owner. (A European Size Unit equals 1,000 European Units of Account of standard gross margin at average 1972-74 values.) The change between 1980 and 1981 resulted in the net deletion of 7,000 holdings but their exclusion has had an insignificant effect on the cropping and stocking figures.

(b)	Cereals for threshing, excluding maize.

(c)	Collected separately in Scotland from 1982 and in Northern Ireland from 1984. id) Includes small area of soft fruit grown under orchard trees in England and Wales.

(e)	Hardy nursery stock, bulbs and flowers.

{/)	Most of the difference between total horticultural area and the sum of individual sectors is made up by the glasshouse area.

(g)	Includes area of other crops and bare fallow not shown in the table.

(h) Before 1975 collected as:

In England and Wales -    clover, sainfoin and temporary grasses   ;

In Scotland -    grass under 7 years old   ;

In Northern Ireland -    grass 1st, 2nd and 3rd year   .

(*) Before 1975 collected as:

In England and Wales -    permanent grass   ;

In Scotland -    grass 7 years old and over   ;

In Northern Ireland -    grass 4th year or older   .

(/) In Great Britain from 1974-1976 other land comprised farm roads, buildings, ponds (not Scotland), derelict land (not Scotland) and farm yards in Scotland only. From 1977 the definition became farm roads, yards, buildings, ponds and derelict land, with gardens included for England and Wales only. In Northern Ireland since 1974 other land has included land under bog, water, roads, buildings, etc., and waste land not used for agriculture.

(A:) Because of changes in coverage of poultry holdings there is a discontinuity in the poultry items between 1982 and 1983. See amended figures for 1983.

(a)	The figures in this Table do not include the minor holdings which for England and Wales have been included in Tables 3 and 5 (see footnote (a) to Table 3). Following the 1983 Census in England and Wales a reappraisal of all holdings including minor holdings was undertaken which resulted in the net loss of some 4,000 holdings from tne 1984 Census. The removal of some 7,000 such holdings from the Census in Northern Ireland between June 1980 and June 1981 (see footnote (a) to Table 3) has no significant effect on this Table. The Northern Ireland figures in the first two sections of the Table include only holdings with 50 smd or more which were only slightly affected by the change, as were the quantities of crops and stock in the other sections of the Table.

The decline in the total number of holdings is reflected in the smallest size group and has marginally increased the average size of some enterprises.

Caution must be exercised in comparing these figures with those quoted in recent Annual Review White Papers and in particular with figures in Annual Review White Papers published prior to the 1978 Review when results were based on imperial measurements and old smd values.

(b)	The average size of holdings based on total area was:

1980 72.2 hectares of which 67.7% was under crops and grass.

1985 72.3 hectares of which 68.8% was under crops and grass.

(c)	These figures include holdings with no crops and grass which are excluded from the first section of the Table.

(d)	With the introduction of revised smd values for the 1978 Annual Review the figures shown in this Table are comparable only with those in the Annual Review White Papers for 1978 onwards (but see note (a) above). The Scottish component of this section has been estimated since 1978, and tnat for Northern Ireland since 1983.

(e)	In 1980 figures related to England and Wales only.

(f)	Figures included for Scotland and Northern Ireland in 1980 relate to the 1979 December Census.

(g)	Figures included for Northern Ireland relate to holdings engaged in fattening only purchased weaners.

(h)	Figures for Scotland and Northern Ireland include small numbers of other table fowls.

(a) The figures are based on returns in the Agricultural Census but include some estimates for figures not directly obtainable						

from the Scottish Census results. Wives/husbands of farmers, partners and directors engaged in farm work were returned						

separately in 1977. Figures for earlier years exclude this category and this is thought to explain the decrease in the number of						

regular whole-time and part-time female workers from 1977 onwards. Figures include estimates for all minor holdings in England and Wales not surveyed in the respective June Censuses (see						

footnote (a) to Table 3).						

(b)	Includes seasonal or casual workers in Northern Ireland. See footnote (c). (c)	Before 1975 seasonal or casual workers were not returned as a separate item				in Northern Ireland, but were included with		

part-time workers. (d) Figures relate to Great Britain only.

fa) Since this table relates to output, i.e. sales, rather than to total production, the quantities valued are not the same as those					

shown for home production in the supply tables (Tables 7-19). Output is net of VAT collected on the sale of inedible products, which is paid to HM Customs and Excise. Figures for total output include subsidies but exclude compensation					

payments.					

(b) The coverage of the Egg Authority   s Packing Station Survey has been extended. The new estimates show a larger proportion of output passing through packing stations. The above estimates are therefore subject to revision.					

(c) This comprises the cost of that part of investment in buildings and works which is physically undertaken by the farmer or farm labour and the value of the physical increase in breeding livestock (breeding livestock capital formation).					

(d) The figures for 1983 and 1984 and the forecast for 1985 include advance payments deferred until 1984,1985 and 1986.					

(e) Work-in-progress is livestock other than breeding livestock, output stocks comprise cereals, potatoes and fruit; input stocks					

comprise fertilisers and purchased feed.					

(f) Sales included in output but subsequently repurchased and so reappearing as input.					

(g) Expenditure is net of VAT reclaimed in the normal way, but each heading includes VAT paid without recovery by, for					

example, unregistered producers.					

(h) Landlords    exDenses are included within farm maintenance, miscellaneous expenditure and depreciation or					buildings and

works. Net rent is the rent paid on tenanted land less these landlords    expenses and the benefit value ot dwellings on that					

land.					

(i) Including veterinary expenses, pesticides, electricity and rates.					

(/) Including employers    national insurance contributions. The estimate in respect of family workers (except spouses) and partners is calculated on the basis of the earnings of hired labour. (k) On commercial debt but excluding loans for land purchases.					

(0 The return to farmers and spouses for their labour, management skills and own capital invested after providing for					

depreciation.

in Northern Ireland as well as land sold for development and other non-agricultural purposes. In addition, the series shown					

for Scotland refer to equipped farms only and exclude sales of unequipped land, whole estates, land sold for afforestation					

and inter-family sales. There is a delay between the date on which a sale is agreed and the date on which it is included in the					

series. The delay is thought to average about 6-9 months	in England and Wales and about 3 months in Northern Ireland.				

The average prices shown in the table for each calendar year relate to sales included in the series for these countries in the					

years ending in the following September and March respectively. In the case of Scotland, the problem is overcome by further					

analysis of information by date of sale. The data for Scotland and Northern Ireland are subject to retrospective revision.					

(c) Reliable figures are not available due to insufficient sales.					

(   d) The indices of average rents for England and Wales are based on an annual rent enquiry and for Scotland on continuing field					

surveys. In Northern Ireland very little land is rented except under the conacre system.

Notes						

(a) The data in Tables 26 and 27 are derived from figures collected in Farm Management Surveys by Universities and Agricultural Colleges in Great Britain and by the Department of Agriculture in Northern Ireland. They relate to full-time						

farms and to averages weighted by the census distribution of agricultural holdings by type of farming and size of business.						

More detailed figures will be published shortly.						

(b) Net income is the return to the farmer and spouse for their manual and managerial labour and the return on tenant-type						

capital in crops	, livestock, machinery, etc., but excluding land and buildings. It is calculated before deduction of interest on					

any farming loans. All farms are treated as rented and an imputed rental value for owner-occupied land is charged as an expense in the accounts. (In Northern Ireland, as rents cannot be imputed with reference to tenanted farms, rental charges						

for owned land and buildings are assessed in relation to estimated sale value.) Stocks of crops and livestock on farms at the						

beginning and end of the accounting year are valued at current market prices and net income includes stock appreciation						

except that arising on breeding cattle, sheep and			pigs. The accounts relate mainly to calendar years or years ending 5 April			

and the average year-ending date is about mid-Fel			jruary.			

(c) Discontinuities in these series occur in 1982/83 and in 1983/84. In years before 1982/83 farms were allocated to farm types						

according to the distribution between the various enterprises of their Standard Gross Margin based on 1972-74 average values. In later years Standard Gross Margins are based on updated values (average 1978/80) and this has led to some						

movement of farms between types and size groups. The extension of the Less Favoured Areas in 1984 led to the transfer of a number of farms from the lowland cattle and sheep to the LFA cattle and sheep category. Results for LFA cattle and sheep farms in 1984/85 and subsequent years therefore relate to a larger number of farm busmesses than previously.						

id) The forecast indices shown for 1985/86 are estimates by the Agriculture Departments based on past survey results and on						

data from the agriculture census, market reports and aggregate farm income calculations. The indices should be regarded only as broad indications of possible income developments assuming normal weather conditions between November and the close of the average accounting year in February. These forecasts take account of payments made under the exceptional weather aid scheme and increased rates of hill livestock compensatory allowances to the extent that these fall within the						

1985/86 accounting year.						

(e) Indices in real terms are those at current prices deflated by the Retail Price Index.						

if)    LFA cattle and sheep    includes all Hill and Upland (LFA) farm types in the Severely Disadvantaged and, from 1984/85,						

the Disadvantaged Areas.    Lowland cattle and sh			eep    mcludes    Cropping, cattle and sheep   .

Notes									

(a) See notes to Table 26.									

(b) Size of business is measured in British Size Units (BSU) based on Standard Gross Margins calculated on a regional basis per unit of crop area and per head of livestock. 1BSU equals 2,000									

European Currency Units of Standard Gross Margins at average 1978-80 values. The size groups are as follows:									

Small 4-15.9 BSU (8-15.9 BSU in Scotland for non-LFA farms)									

Medium 16-39.9 BSU									

Large 40 BSU and over (in	England and for cropping farms in Scotland)								

(40-99.9 in Wales and for types other than cropping farms m Scotland).									

(c) Number of holdings at 1984 June Census. For the LFA cattle and sheep and lowland cattle and sheep types, numbers of holdings have been adjusted to reflect the extension of the Less									

Favoured Areas during 1984.									

(d) Average farm area includes rough grazing.

(a)	This table excludes expenditure which may benefit farmers but where the value to them is not shown by the expenditure (e.g. expenditure on animal disease or on research, advice and education). It also excludes most expenditure on agriculture in Northern Ireland, borne on the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund. It does, however, include some expenditure which benefits consumers and trade interests rather than producers. The figures for years up to and including 1984/85 represent actual expenditure recorded in the Appropriation Accounts. The figures for 1985/86 are the latest estimates of expenditure. (b)	The figures are made up of several elements and include refunds on intra-Communitv trade, import and export refunds on third country trade, the beef and sheep variable premium schemes (net of clawback for sheepmeat and charges on beef exported and sold into intervention), aid for private storage and animal feed, certain other marketing and production subsidies and the cost of purchasing commodities into intervention less proceeds from sales. The figures are also net of other receipts treated as negative expenditure, namely monetary compensatory amounts levied on intra-Community trade (in the case of pigmeat these exceed expenditure) and the co-responsibility and supplementary levies on milk producers. Receipts from levies on the production and storage of sugar and isoglucose and on third country exports, which are regarded as Community Own Resources, are excluded. The figures include the EC butter subsidy, which ended in May 1985, and the United Kingdom share of the EC school milk subsidy scheme. (c)	Includes eggs, poultrymeat, fruit and vegetables, hops, herbage seeds, dried fodder, peas and beans, fisheries, flax and aid to beekeepers. Also includes expenditure on products covered by the CAP but not produced to any significant extent in the United Kingdom (olive oil, rice, wine, grapemust and hemp). (id) Takes account of a change in 1986 in the start of the marketing year for sheepmeat which may mean that the 1985 sheep annual premium payments are paid in full before the end of the financial year 1985/86. (e)	Payments in respect of wool andpotatoes relate partly to the clip or crop of the year indicated and partly to the clip or crop in the preceding year or years. The negative figure for wool reflects the stabilisation arrangements with the British Wool Marketing Board whereby advance payments made by the Exchequer are repayable from later surpluses when auction prices are above the guaranteed price. (f)	Includes the Farm and Horticulture Development Scheme. (g)	Farmers in special areas are also eligible for additional assistance under the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Scheme, Northern Ireland Agricultural Development Programme, the Agriculture and Horticulture Grant Scheme, the Agriculture Improvement Regulations and the Agriculture Improvement Scheme. The estimated benefit is shown separately in Section IV of the table. (h)	Includes the Farm and Horticulture Capital Grant Schemes. (i)	Includes loan guarantees, grants for agricultural drainage in Scotland and producer organisations (provision for these items was included in the 1985/86 Supply Estimates), grants for milk pasteurisation equipment and farm structure loans. (j)	The receipts from the Guidance Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund do not relate to expenditure incurred during the financial year but mainly to expenditure incurred in the calendar year preceding the financial year. (k)	Includes grants for forage groups, integrated development programme for the Western Isles, producers in the Scottish Islands and crofting improvements. Provision for these items was mcluded in the 1985/86 Supply Estimates. The individual figures may not add up to the totals shown due to roundings.
