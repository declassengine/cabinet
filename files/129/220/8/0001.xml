LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1986-87 AND 1987-88 Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council

  SI	   

The Queen&apos;^Speeches and Future Legislation Committee (QL) have now	I

considered the proposals made by colleagues for the Bills to be included in next Session&apos;s legislative programme. Our recommendations are summarised at Annex A. A fud^F^ist of the 55 bids for 1986-87 and the five bids for 1987-88 is at Ani\4x

SIZE OF 1986-87 PROI^fflJE^

2 We were very constfrw&amp;dn making our choice that the 1986-87 Session could be affected by a	Election. If the Election were towards the

end of the Session, we woul^/frone to be able to salvage a good deal of the legislation then going thr&amp;fefijBarliament, and this would best be achieved by putting forward a componeit  ^p  \solid, relatively non-controversial, measures which the Opposition&lt;Vt%Mbe prepared to facilitate. On the other hand, the programme clear^y^a/eeds to reflect the ongoing thrust o Government policy, with no sladrenMiS^P^ purpose.

3.	The Committee believed that, iw^ajwevent, it was essential to limit

the size of next Session&apos;s programme&lt;^fC-e  ttier to relieve the pressure on backbenchers. This Session is already&gt;  Kowing the difficulties of getting through large volumes of legislation	a General Election approaches,

Members of Parliament will be eager to sp^nd more time in their constituencies. We cannot expect to continue to push through the large amount of legislation which has been a feature of the last two Sessions.

4.	We therefore concluded that the 1986-87 pwgr^nme should be limited to

27 Bills. This is significantly lower than in	years, but there will

also of course be the inevitable additions during(fcljB/^ear. In addition, we were very conscious of the*potential impact of ciw^Onannel Fixed Link Bill. This is due to be introduced later this SessiongWy, as a hybrid Bill, it can be carried over from one Session to the S^eTM/wd the indications are that it will use up substantial time in       ^986-87 Session.	&lt;vO)

   CONTENT OF THE PROGRAMME

\5 As always, QL looked for a balance between Bills which would further policies, but which would prove very controversial; those which are ^rthy but not exciting; and those which are short and can be slipped into v-tiL\crevices of a Parliamentary programme. We also looked for the usual &quot;^S^ces between introductions in the House of Commons and the Lords, and bhtvii^n different Departments.

6 C^eSha.rted with the five Bills which had alredy secured advanced place&lt;^is/a result of Cabinet&apos;s decisions last year. These are Petroleum, CriminJ5S*tice, Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) (Amendment), CopyriSSvSS Intellectual Property, and Banking. The second and last of these areOa(^i  ^tial for the furtherance of our social and economic policy aims and w^Jild be especially important in presenting the programme.

7.	We draw particular attention to Water Authorities Privatisation, which will provide for a^-further substantial tranche of privatisation, and is therefore presentfa?I  ally very significant. While we thought it right to out this Bill forSiarsh^o maintain the momentum of this part of our	I

policies, the Commi^Qjhad a good deal of anxiety about it, because of its size and complexityrisks of its passage and implementation becoming entangled in&lt;   ^5^ion timing. Colleagues will recognise the strain a Bill of this si^pkts upon the programme, and the need for any necessary policy decisioli^^^e taken as early as possible.

8	We have also included	&apos;Government Finance (Reform) Scotland,which

will build the framework for^^ew local government financial system in that country, and Local GoveriMe&amp;t^which will reform the local authority capital control machinery and et^O^age contracting out in local government. In addition, we have (pcc&amp;ded Fire Precautions and Crowd Safety which -will give effect to th^/frecommendations of the Popplewell Inquiry; Broads, which will please fhp^ehvironmental lobby; and Consumer Goods and Services, which will please,^3Serx:onsumer lobby.

UNSUCCESSFUL BIDS	\&lt;

9	We inevitably excluded many good candidates. Perhaps the most important are Industrial Relations, Child Care, Licensing (Amendment) and Dartford Crossing. On the first of these, whioip&apos;Wyuld remove the legal basis for the closed shop, we felt that the ti^ofcUndustrial relations was now so much in our favour that it would be codziti^-productive to legislate again so quickly. Child Care is a very\g4s  &amp;fctive Bill, but there are financial implications which have not yet&lt;b^g^esolved, and it is a very long Bill both to draft and to take through(&gt;^aNUment. This is the sort of Bill which would be a good candidate for ch   \^9&amp;7-88 Session.

If it is not on the Statute Book by the General Election/tf^hould certainly feature in our Manifesto. Licensing (Amendmen^vliah]la great deal to commend it, but it will arouse some implacable opponents^-^wk doubted if it would   be wise to proceed with it so close to an Electionsoon after the Shops Bill. The provision of a new Dartford Cross

certainly an important element in our road programme and legisl^i^d^would


   be necessary for any scheme which involved toils as currently proposed.

&gt; But the present position on the policy is not so clear as to encourage us    ^to Cake a decision to include it at this stage.

:^X^87-88 PROGRAMME

considered the advance place bids for 1987-88 on the basis of our S^criteria, that large and complex Bills which require a considerable preparation benefit from having an assured place a year earlier thar/^f^rwise would have been the case. There is, of course, a particular orobleat^vth the 1987-88 Session, which must be the last year of the ParliSSKand will inevitably be truncated. Nevertheless, the advance place siSsS^wiU be of value, since even if the Session does not take place weiSfr^ave in an advanced state of preparation Bills which could be introduceo\a  ter the Election. Child care is a good example of a Bill which could^ither hope to secure rapid passage through Parliament in truncated 1987-88 Session, or, if this did not prove possible, coul feature in our Manifesto. But, on balance, the Committee felt that it     would be preferab/leTsb put off taking decisions about the advance places until Cabinet hasCCeSled the shape of the 1986-87 programme. We are not making any recommemjgi^s, about advance places at this stage.

TIMETABLE

11 Finally, I wish to   di&amp;^ise the particular importance of ensuring thit Bills are prepared and^Wy for introduction as soon as possible after the start of the nextvKsUon. We must attempt to deal with as much as possible of our programme  ^ earlier part of the Session and this is especially true of the mor&lt;^pM;oversial Bills. This means taking policy decisions as early as p^ge and being restrained in adding new subject matter to the bids accept^b^Cabinet.

CONCLUSIONS

12.	I therefore invite colleagues to

a.	approve the list of Essential,programme and Uncontroversial Bills at Annex A;

b.	note the Contingent Bills listed in An  S^B and agree that they should be brought forward if necessary;

c note the Committee&apos;s view that up to fr(e^jjyetice places should be given to Bills for the 1987-88 Session, but&lt;e%fcj:hese decisions should be taken in the context of Cabinet&apos;s deci^^J^on the 1986-87 Session;


   d. accept the need for all Departments rigorously to observe timetables for preparing the Bills for which they are responsible.

3. LOCAL GOVERNMENT (COMMISSIONERS) BILL To enable the Secretary of State to dismiss the councillors of a local authority and to appoint Commissioners in the event of breakdown of finances and services. The Bill could either be general or apply to a specific authority.	DOE	No public commitment has been given to the introduction of the Bill. But Ministers have indicated that if there was a serious breakdown in an authority then some appropriate form of Government action would be needed. Legislation on these lines would be highly controversial embodying as it does a major constitutional change. Both the Opposition and the local government would strongly oppose the provisions. The emergency which led to the introduction of the Bill should however assist its passage by making clear the reason and need for the legislation.	Short. The Bill will need to be enacted on anjtemergency timetable against the background of service breakdown and come into operation immediately on Royal Assent. An authority-specific Bill would be hybrid and hybridity procedures would need to be waived.	There may need to be additional central government manpower as a back-up to the Commission. As the Bill is designed to allow order to be restored in a local authority suffering from financial or service breakdown, additional local taxation (and possibly central funding) may be necessary in the short term. Local manpower levels might be reduced as a means of reducing expenditure . However, it is impossible to make accurate forecasts under this heading. There are no EC implications identified.	Both general and authority-specific Bills were drafted in the 1983/84 Session. The policy was considered by MISC 95 and E(LF) and the general Bill by L Committee. Further policy clearance and some amendment to either Bill will certainly be necessary, but either could be introduced at short notice.

10. VOCATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS To establish, fund and staff a Vocational Qualifications Council to advise the relevant Secretaries of State on the approval of vocational qualifications. To empower the Council to make levies on bodies awarding approved qualifications. To empower the Secretaries of State to require that local education authorities shall not provide courses leading to non-approved qualifications; and that public bodies shall have regard to holders of approved qualifications in their recruitment and promotion policies.	DES	Although consistent with widely-supported DES/DE/ DTI approach, major bodies affected, including chartered examining bodies and professional bodies might resist strongly.	Short/medium Royal Assent deisirable by July 1987 (Ministers may wish initially to establish the body, under the Companies Acts or otherwise, at an earlier date, and the seeking of the additional powers through legislation is contingent on inadequate voluntary progress towards rationalisation of qualifications).	Exchequer cost should be some   2 million per annum reducing through levies/ payments to the VQC. Staff should be of the order of 50, but possibly some savings in MSC. Some EC directives already bear on the structure of qualifications for certain professions; further EC legislation possible, but the proposal does not per se cut across any EC requirements.

28. CIVIL PROTECTION IN PEACETIME To enable local authorities to use their civil defence resources in connection with peacetime emergencies.	HO	Manifesto commitment. Difficult to judge Opposition reaction. Labour Party is hostile to present civil defence policy but not to contingency planning for peacetime emergencies. Opposition would probably make sceptical comments about civil defence and perhaps allege an attempt to camouflage civil defence activity, but probably not oppose. Civil defence interests are strongly in favour.	Very short 3 Clauses	No financial, manpower or EC implications. Resource provided under civil defence legislation will not be increased on account of this Bill.	The Bill has been drafted. It has been taken up by Sir Nicholas Bonsor who came sixth in the ballot for Privat Members&apos; Bills this session. If not enacted in Private Membei time this sessior it could be re-introduced as a Government Bill at the start of the 1986/87 session.

Likely to receive wide support. Could be of some interest to House of Lords. Opposition attitude uncertain, but likely to support in principle. Will be controversial with anti-alcohol lobby, possibly with medical profession and some employees. Pressure for Bill comes from licensed trade and tourism, catering and leisure industries. No particular sectional appeal.	Short. A candidate for introduction in the Lords, but interest in the Commons suggests introduction there.	None.	Policy clearance H Committee agreed in principle on 3 December that a relaxatioi in licensing law! was desiirable but postponed a final decision on policy pending further evidence of tangible support for reform. H to consider further (probably after Easter    86) in the light of a report from the Home Secretary. Timing of instructions dependent on policy approval but should not take long to prepare.

LCD	The Bill as annexed to Law Commission No 110 is not highly controversial in itself.

33. PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONE (EXTENSION OF JURISDICTION) (a)	To extend the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration to&apos; listed Non-Depart-mental Bodies. (b)	To amend the provisions in the Parliamentary Commissioner Act 1967 relating to the appointment and removal of the Parliamentary Commissioner.	* MPO	PQ announcing CMND 9563 (Observations on 4th Report of Select Committee on PCA 1983/4) noted legislation to be introduced in due course to amend PCA Act 1967 (Hansard Col. 311, 8 July 1985). Likely to be welcomed on all sides of the House, as it covers Select Committee recommendations; but may be pressure for other extensions of jurisdiction.	Very short: probably one clause for each main topic, two supplemental clauses, one schedule. Possibly suitable for Second Reading Committee procedure in that the policy itself is uncon-troversial. The subject of the Bill contains an area which could be regarded as involving hybridity; the instructions to Parliamentary Counsel will be designed to ensure that this problem is avoided. Not suitable for H of L introduction, given the PCA&apos;s close links with H of C and the origin of the Bill in a H of C Select Committee report.	EC: None Financial and Manpower: there may be a modest increase in PCA manpower and hence financial needs from 1987-88; estimates are not yet available but seem unlikely to involve more than 10% increase over the PES period above the current provision of   1.9m. No PES provision has yet been sought because of the uncertaintly.	- Policy clear-ance for (a)	Obtained H correspondence 20 June 1985 and for (b)	early February.

49a. OLYMPIC GAMES (FINANCI INDEMNITY) BILL To indemnify Birmingham City Council against loss on the total cancellation of the Olympic Games should the city be successful in it bid for the 1992 Games.	1L DOE 3	Uncontroversial in party political terms. The intention to introduce the Bill, should the Birmingham bid be successful, was announced on 21.2.86 in answer to a PQ from Sir Reginald Eyre MP. Failure to provide this degree of support for Birmingham would invite wide public criticism. The final decision on which city is to host the Games will be made by the International Olympics Committee (IOC) in October 1986.	Very short (possibly only one clause). Suitable for Second Reading Committee procedure.	The indemnity offered will be for losses in excess of   100 million but might amount to up to   450 million on Birmingham&apos;s own estimates.	Policy approval given by H on 11 February. Bill should be ready in time for November introduction, should the bid be successful. Drafting cannot begin until mid-October .
