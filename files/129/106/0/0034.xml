secret &quot;c &quot;^UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1961C (61) 134 Copy No.    5612th September, 1961CABINETTHE ECONOMIC situation note by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate for the information of my colleagues a letter I have recently receivedfrom the Governor of the Bank of England.S. L.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,8th September, 1961.Copy of a Letter from the Governor of the Bank of England to theChancellor of the Exchequer, dated 6th September, 1961My dear Chancellor,It is now just over a month since you introduced your economic measures todeal with the chronic deficit on our balance of payments and, although it is too early yet for the full effects of these various measures to have percolated to anydepth in the industrial sector of the economy, it is perhaps worth while at thispoint to make a brief review of such effects as have been created and equally important to take note of any failure of effect.It is undoubtedly true to say that the increase in Bank Rate has not made thesame psychological impact on the foreign observer of our affairs as the similarincrease made in 1957. It can, however, be contended with considerable assurance that the monetary measures generally have played the leading part in there-establishment of sterling above parity. It has been a significant achievement tohave destroyed, for the time being, the conjectures which are always current whensterling is for any period close to the lower support point that either we intend to devalue or may be forced to devalue and to have put a stop to further speculationagainst the pound. As short positions fall to be covered at maturity this should lead to accruals to the reserves in the next month or two.There has not as yet been the inflow of funds from abroad which would normally be associated with high money rates in London, and indeed for thepresent this suits us well, but at the same time is indicative of a &quot; wait and see &quot;attitude abroad. The Berlin crisis is, of course, also a factor although the Swissand Italians seem to have been gaining funds on this self-same score. But themore fundamental reason for funds not flowing to London is unquestionably stilllack of confidence in our taking measures to increase our competitiveness. Thestrident background fully reported in the Press and widely read abroad of continuing indiscriminate wage demands, despite your plea for a &quot; pause&quot;,continues to create doubts in people&apos;s minds.  This sort of lack of confidence is,59656
i feel, bound to continue until an issue is faced and upheld by the GovernmentConversely any climbing down or giving in by the Government or any majoWindustry will almost certainly start a new run against sterling. The whole questionof labour /management relations is being watched closely as the key fundamentalfactor in our situation and if you succeed in obtaining Trade Union participation in your new planning body this will certainly be hailed as a major step forward.&quot;Asiwcil as our competitiveness, close interest is being taken in the degree of ability and aggressiveness that we need to show in diverting to export sales the capacityfreed by restraint of demand at home. There is still some considerable doubt ofour will in this.It is these sorts of uncertainties, more widely recognised to-day than in 1957,that have lessened the psychological impact abroad of the substantial increase inBank Rate. Many people recollect that the speed of building up the economy inthe late summer of 1958 undermined relatively rapidly the basically soundersituation created by the increase of Bank Rate in 1957 and now raises the questionwhether we are likely to pursue the appropriate disciplines with resolution orwhether we are not relying excessively on monetary measures.The effects of the increase in Bank Rate on the domestic economy are stilldifficult to assess but there appears to be growing evidence that the combination of higher Bank Rate, together with the other constituents of the credit squeezeapplied against the present background, are proving more effective than such measures have proved in the past when technical conditions were less propitiousfor their efficacy. The reduction of  104 million in the advances of the LondonClearing Banks for the period ending 16th August is significant. The liquiditysituation is generally becoming more stringent, as we intended, and 1 have been encouraged both by the degree of co-operation and the attitude of mind adoptedby the various institutions whose support we have sought at this time. But if anyworth-while benefit is to accrue these various measures need to act longer in orderto achieve the results we must see. I believe that all the various measures are working but, in the case of speculative building, the slowing down of new projectsis likely to take time owing to a high level of existing commitments for finance.Relying as we are so heavily on monetary measures, excessive haste in relaxationbefore the longer-term measures in other fields are seen to be evolving and takingeffect, would of course throw away the temporary improvement in our affairs and encourage the belief that the outlook is less serious than it is.The complaints of some exporters of the effects of the 7 per cent. Bank Rateare understandable in themselves in the cases where they can be substantiated,which by no means applies in the case of every complaint. They do, however,appear to show lack of comprehension of the purpose of a high Bank Rate whichis not only to increase the cost of credit at home but at the same time to discouragethe foreigner from borrowing or obtaining credit in this market. It is the need to acquire cash accruals to the reserves by transferring the burden of the financeto other centres that is the basic justification in this aspect of the use of Bank Rate.Goods sold on credit do not obviously benefit the reserves until payment is received.A Bank Rate as high as 7 per cent, must essentially be a temporary state of affairs and, whilst the cost of credit sales is augmented by the increased cost of financing,this should in itself stimulate aggressiveness in seeking cash sales and some ingenuity,which appears to be lacking, in seeking finance in other centres where rates are lower. It may be argued that it is paradoxical that at a time when increased exports are needed the financing of exports should be made more expensive, but when looked at against the need for early accruals to the reserves the logic of theeffect of Bank Rate becomes more evident. Notwithstanding this and quite apartfrom the impact of the increased Bank Rate, I do feel that the time is opportune for a review of existing facilities for providing finance for exports and aminstigating a study of this matter which in due course I will look forward todiscussing with you.The exuberance with which the Press have greeted the announcement of thereserve figures for the end of August, without getting into the proper perspectivethe fact that we have contracted exceedingly heavy foreign debts and that the underlying balance of payments is likely to remain adverse for some time, strikesme as most unfortunate. Whilst we have happily avoided the creation of a crisisatmosphere we do seem to be faced with an important task in the public relations&apos;field ojfc impressing continuously upon the public the seriousness of our positionand thplong-term need for greater and sustained effort where this can most help
dfl&amp;ie economy.   Whilst avoiding the accusation of crying &quot; woe &quot;, an attitude of&quot;Complacency at this time would seem to me likely to undermine the modest gainswe have achieved.To sum up, I think it may be fairly claimed that the monetary measures arehelping to achieve what we set out to achieve in the short run, i.e., to restore confidence in the pound. In themselves they will not correct the underlying balanceof payments deficit. They are regarded merely as earnests of our general intentions.The real test still lies ahead in the wider field of the Governments general economic policy.Yours sincerely,(Signed)      CROMER.The Right Hon. Selwyn Lloyd, C.B.E., Q.C., M.P.
