0PUBLIC EXPENDITUREThis paper records the decisions on public expenditure taken by ministers in the course of the discussions leading up to the statement of25th July by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the economic debate on 26th and 27th July.Civil Public Investment, 1961/62 and 1962/632,        Certain changes have been agreed in the figures shown inAppendix B to C. (61) 106.   Revised tables, showing the latest position on 1961/62 and 1962/63, and giving brief explanations of the changes, arenow attached to this paper at Appendix A.Road programme.        Ministers have agreed to a five-year programme for the years1962/63 - 1966/67.   Under this programme Exchequer payments in thoseyears and in 196l/62 will be as follows:-  millions	England and	Scotland	Total	Wales		1961/62	76. 0	11. 8	87. 81962/63	90. 5	12. 0	102. 51963/64	101. 0	12. 0	1964/65	108. 0	12. 8	120. 81965/66	115. 0	14. 6	129. 61966/67	123. 0	16. 0	139. 0(These figures differ from those given in Appendix A - 98. $^millions and  114. 3 millions for Great Britain in1961/62 and 1962/63 respectively - because the latterinclude local authority payments in respect of classified roads and a small element for trunk road lighting. )This is a firm programme, subject to the possibility of modifications to allow for:-(a) Small percentage variations in accordance with review proceduresaffecting all civil public investment programmes.(b) Variations in costs, technical changes, and changes in trafficgrowth and patterns requiring a measure of flexibility within the programmesthemselves.(c) Unexpected major developments in the general economic situation.
health4,        The growth of current expenditure on the hospital service, theExecutive Council services and the local health and welfare services willfor the next four years be planned within the financial limit for GreatBritain of anincrease of  80 millions (at the pay and prices of the first quarter of 196l) over the estimated figure of  850 millions for 1961/62.This would mean an increase of about 2j per cent per annum in real termsover the whole field.   Within the total the Health Ministers would have some flexibility between thevarious elements and (within moderate amounts)taking account of savings in other parts of these Votes.Estimates for 1962/635.        In his statement of 25th July (Hansard, Col. 224) theChancellor of the Exchequer announced his intention to do his utmost tokeep the Estimates for 1962/63 at a level not more than Zj per cent in real terms above the Budget Estimates for 1961/62.   This would imply anincrease of not more than  125 millions oh a comparables pay and price .basis.6.        The Forecast Estimates for 1962/63, as submitted to the Treasury,totalled  5, 412 millions (at the pay and prices ruling in the 196l/62 Estimatesor  225 millions more than the Budget Estimates for 1961/62.   To-achieve the Chancellor&apos;s aim described in paragraph 5 above will therefore call for reductions of  100 millions on the Estimates as submitted.   The figureof  175 millions quoted by the Chancellor in his statement as representingthe reduction of the load in 1962/63 compared with what it would have beenotherwise was made up of this  100 millions, ;together with  75 millions :from1 the reduction of the original proposals for local authorities&apos;investment expenditure in 1962/63.7. The saving of some  125 millions below the line in 1962/63 (also referred to by the Chancellor) arises from the completion of the steelloans and the suspension of the house purchase scheme.   There will accordingly be no expenditure below the line for these purposes in 1962/63,compared with  88 millions for advances to Messrs. Richard Thomas and baldwins and Messrs. Colvilles and  39 millions (net) for loans for house purchase in 1961/62.Other Points8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer also referred in his statement to the Government&apos;s policy on the nationalised industries, on assistanceto industry and on agricultural support.   He said (Hansard, Col. 223);&quot;. . . . we must see that priority is given to whatever directlyaffects national efficiency, and that we do not wastefully disruptprogrammes under way.   We shall, therefore, not interfere, withthe investment that the nationalised industries require for attainingtheir financial targets and providing essential supplies and services.The sums required for assistance to industry will fall away nextyear, and we shall apply very strict criteria to any new proposals.We shall have to look critically at the level of agricultural supportduring the 1962 Review. &quot;These themes were developed more fully in his speech on 26th July(Hansard, Cols. 435-6).Treasury Chambers, S.
