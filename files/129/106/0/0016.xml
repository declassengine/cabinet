no(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government. (61) 11626th July, 1961COPY NO.CABINETBERLINMemorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs this paper (annexed) sets out some ideas on how we might approach the problem of Berlin in the coming weeks and what might be the basis for eventual negotiations with the Soviet Union.    My colleagues may wishto consider this, together with memoranda (C. (61) 115 and C. (61) 118)circulated by the Minister of Defence in order to obtain a comprehensiveview of the problem as a whole.    It is not my intention at present to invite decisions upon the political aspects of the problem and I do-not suggest that all the suggestions contained in the paper will necessarilystand up to further investigation.2.      1 would summarise the tactical problem from the point of view ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government as follows.    Too much talk of militarypostures is undesirable because it is likely to frighten people rather thanstiffen them and may easily start a rot among the neutrals.    However,it is certainly right for the West to strengthen its hand against the eventuality of negotiations in an unprovocative and calm way.    It is inthis spirit that Mr. Kennedy has presented his proposals.3.      On the other hand, too much talk of negotiation (for all that itis in principle fully accepted by the Americans) is embarrassing forthem and ricks encouraging charges that the British are &quot;soft&quot; aboutBerlin.     The best hope of reaching a negotiating position is through quietdiplomacy.     The United States Secretary of State, Mr. Rusk, agrees with this and I hope that the talks which the Foreign Ministers will have in Paris early in August will be kept as secret as possible so that theycan be frank.     Even so, they may not of course be very productiveas it will be impossible to mention most of the ingredients of apossible successful negotiation with the Russians in front of theGermans, and the French will no doubt continue to make no effective contribution and to talk simply of standing firm.     However, I would hope to find out at least in bilateral discussion with Mr. Rusk how wecan between us bring about negotiation to the best advantage.H.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.26th July, 1961.
ANNEXBERLINThe ProblemIt is now clear that Mr.Khrushchev intends to bring the Berlinquestion to a head this year.    He will probably take the occasion of theXXIInd Party Congress on 17th October for an announcement of the signature of a separate peace treaty with East Germany, unless in themeantime something has occurred to deter him.    The announcement would probably name a specific future date, probably a few days or weekslater, for convening a peace conference, although it is not impossible that it could say that the treaty is being signed forthwith.    Mr. Khrushchevhas reserved for himself flexibility as to timing.2.      The declared Soviet doctrine is that a separate peace treaty withEast Germany will provide for &quot;free city&quot; status for West Berlin and cause Western rights in Berlin to lapse.    Western troops may remainthere, but their communications between West Germany and west berlin will have to be negotiated with the sovereign East German&apos; Govern-ment.    Mr. Khrushchev has implied that, in default of such negotiations,these communications will be blocked and that any attempt to reopenthem by force will be met by force.    But here again there is uncertaintywhether the communications would be impeded immediately or whether there would be a period of &quot;reasonableness&quot; on the part of the EastGermans, followed by a slow squeeze designed to force us into closerand closer dealings with the Deutsche Demokratische Republik (D. D, R.).Thus we cannot know when the physical interference with our rightsand interests will occur.3.      But we assume that, unless by 17th October something has happened to deter Mr. Khrushchev from signing a separate peace treaty, a physical challenge to our position in West Berlin will followeither at once or within a short time.4.      It is the general consensus of those who have seen mr. Khrushchev recently that he would still prefer a negotiated settle-ment if he can get one.     The signature of a separate peace treaty withEast Germany would certainly constitute a dramatic gesture of the sort which Mr. Khrushchev probably wants to make for prestigereasons.     It is not, however, the most satisfactory solution from hispoint of view.    Apart from the grave danger of war which it mayentail, it does not ensure Western recognition of the D. D. R. and tosome extent it would reduce Soviet control over events.    It would bemuch better for Mr. Khrushchev if he could force the West tonegotiate with him a settlement which would have the effect ofstabilising and legitimising the East German   regime and weakeningthe Western position in Berlin.5.      It follows from this that Mr. Khrushchev might be deterred from taking unilateral action in October if some real prospect of negotiation on terms which he would think satisfactory were opened up before that date.-1-
6.     Western opinion is moving fast in the direction of negotiation.The Federal German Chancellor, Dr. Adenauer, himself has saidpublicly that he is convinced there will be negotiation this year.    TheAmerican memorandum on Berlin handed to us by the State Department(which clearly has Presidential approval) proposes, as the secondelement in Western policy for the immediate future, &quot;an activediplomatic programme, including negotiations with the Soviet Union,designed to provide the Soviet leadership with an alternative course ofaction which does not endanger vital Western interests in Berlin&quot;.The Soviet reaction to the last Western Notes has so far been mild andthere is what seems to be an interest in negotiation in preference tounilateral action on the Soviet side.What would we negotiate about?7.     Any negotiation on the subject of Germany and Berlin at thepresent time will be extremely tough and difficult, since mr. Khrushchev&apos;s aims are far-reaching, his position strong and hisself-confidence very great.     Leaving aside long-term Sovietobjectives for Germany and any hope he may have of inflicting ahumiliation on the Western Powers (see the memorandum on East/west relations - C. (61) 97), it is probably fair to say that his minimumrequirement will be a result which stabilises the D. D. R. to a sufficientdegree to lay the spectre of a unified, anti-Communist Germany.     the weakness and instability of the D. D. R. (so long as free West Berlinprevents its total isolation from the free world) is probably the maindriving force behind Soviet insistence upon a change.8.      Putting the most charitable interpretation on Soviet motives,one can see their fear that an increasingly powerful and prosperousWest Germany, clearly devoted to the concept of German reunification,may prove too powerful a magnet for all Germans and end by under-mining the existence of the D. D. R. unless the latter can beartificially stabilised and strengthened.     If this is bo, Mr. Khrushchev&apos;s immediate objectives will be closely related to strengthening theD. D. R.     They will be such things as forcing international recognitionof the regime under the Chairman of the East German Council of State,Herr Ulbricht, and the pigeon-holing of German reunification as anaim;  acceptance of the Eastern frontiers of Germany (Cder-Neisse line);elimination of the Berlin escape route for refugees;  reduction of the worst effects of the Berlin &quot;example&quot; on Eastern Germany and rondoring thyWestern garrisons incapable of discharging thsir present task and loosen-ing Berlin1.1; ties with the Federal Republic.     Zehind these immediateobjectives will lie the further longer-term hope of eliminating the/estern garrisons altogether, incorporating West Berlin in Sast Germanyand loosening the Federal Republic&apos;s ties with the West,  stopping the nuclear rearmament of Germany and, by breaking up the North atlantic alliance, bringing tc an end American participation in ^urcpe&apos;s defence.9.      Among these immediate Coviet objectives can be detected somethin-n .whi ch are not wholly irreconcilable with Western policy.    Wecould, f..r example, accept the stabilisation of Germany&apos;s eastern frontier on the Oder-Neisse line.     Nor, in fact, do we really wantGerman reunification, at least for the time being, though we cannot-2-
abandon the principle of self-determination for the Germans.    Thesame is probably true of the rest of the North Atlantic Alliance, includingthe West Germans.    German reunification now would upset what hasbeen achieved in Western European integration since the war.    We arenot seeking to bring about the collapse of the East German regime throughthe departure of its most valuable citizens;  on the contrary, we (andthis includes the Federal Republic) are embarrassed by the greatlyincreased flow of refugees.    If it were a question of a general stabilisation-tion of the existing division in Europe, at least for a period of years,we should presumably have no reason to object;  indeed, given thestrength of the Soviet position on the ground we should probably considerourselves lucky to obtain it.    Unpleasant though it would be to have tobolster up a Communist dictatorship like that of Herr Ulbricht, it isnot necessarily the case that in the long run a peace treaty with thatregime would be detrimental to freedom in Germany.    For the east german regime will not reach the end of its troubles merely by acquiringa degree of international recognition, nor even by reducing the nuisanceof Berlin.    It i3 at least arguable that the influence of the 47 millionWest Germans could be brought to bear more effectively on the 17 millionEast Germans if the Federal Government would pursue a differentpolicy and be prepared to enter into closer relationships with the east german regime.     They have hitherto shown remarkable lack of couragein this respect.10.    In other words, it seems not inconceivable that we could build anegotiating policy on the broad principle of stabilisation for a period ofyears, say for the next five years, and that we could reach a practicaldeal with Mr. Khrushchev on this basis without either side beingcompelled to abandon any really crucial position.    It must be recognisedthat under any such.deal the West would have necessarily abandoned acertain number of principles which have hitherto been strongly held.Such a policy would mean placing the Berlin problem in a wider frameand attempting a general - if provisional - stabilisation of the Germansituation.    Possible elements out of which such a deal might be constructed are as follows: -(a) We should accept the decision of the Soviets and their friends to sign a peace treaty with East Germany and be willing todeal with the D. D. R. as the de facto authority in East Germany.(b) We need not ourselves sign a peace treaty with east germany or recognise it de jure.     It would probably be necessary,however, for the Federal Government to abandon the &quot;Hallstein&quot;doctrine whereby they refuse diplomatic relations with any country which enters into similar relations with the D. D. R.    The result ofthis will be a great increase of East German diplomatic activitythroughout the world.    A longer term result might be a move for the admission of both Germanys into the United Nations.(c) We might urge the Federal Government to consider thepossibility of establishing contacts with East Germany which would go some way in the direction of the confederal relationship betweenthe two Germanys which the Russians urge.-3-
(d) We could recognise the overall frontiers of Germany(Oder-Neisse line).(e) Our conditions for all this would be a guarantee by theRussians that the present status of West Berlin would be preserved(i. e. , no free city in the Russian sense and no Russian troops) andthat Western access to West Berlin, both civilian and military, wouldbe fully and freely maintained by their clients, the D. D. R. authoritieu.We would not insist on regarding the D. D. R. personnel as agents of theRussians;  we would deal with them on their own merits as de factoGerman authorities; but the Russians would have undertaken a contractual obligation towards us to see that our access was not inter-interfered with and we would seek redress of grievances from them and not from the D. D. R. Government.    We would claim that our existing rights remained valid at the same time, but we need not insist on theiradmitting it.(f) The Russians would not give such guarantees regardingthe behaviour of their German allies without asking us for guaranteesabout the behaviour of ours.     We might be able to contemplate agree-ments on the following points:-(i)    That there will be no manufacture or possession of nuclear weapons by Germans in any part of germany during the lifetime of the arrangement.(ii)    That no missiles or nuclear weapons will be brought within X miles of the demarcation line or into Berlin.(iii)    That certain activities of a propagandist nature will nortake place in any part of Berlin.    We might admitUnited Nations or neutral (but not Russian) observersinto West Berlin to confirm that these undertakingswere being observed (with reciprocal arrangementsfor East Berlin).(iv)   That West Berlin might offer space and accommodationon an extra-territorial basis to certain organs of theUnited Nations.     This might both make it easier forthe Russians to justify granting a guarantee of accessand offer them some assurance of responsiblebehaviour in West Berlin.     There might possibly bea similar arrangement in East Berlin.(v)   It is for consideration whether there is any means of limiting the flow of refugees which would be tolerablefrom the Western and from the humane point of view.At present the refugees are being flown out of west berlin in allied aircraft as if they were allied traffic.This is legally tenable but seems to be stretching ourrights rather far;   but it is apparently hallowed byusage and would be very difficult to end.     The veryfact of a settlement having been reached would tendto reduce the flow.--SI-SECRET
SECRET 1Q135       16(g) It is worth examining whether, in this connection, some kindof nuclear disengagement on a wider basis could be proposed and whetherplans for an area of limitation of armaments and armed forces or theprevention of surprise attack, with mutual air inspection of both sides of the line, might not also be revived.(h) A non-aggression agreement between the North atlantic alliance and the Warsaw Pact, though fairly meaningless, might beadded for good measure.How to bring about negotiation11.     It must not be supposed that we shall have an easy task in persuading our allies that a deal of this kind is even desirable and our most difficult problem in the coming weeks will be to decide how andwhen it is safe even to hint to them that we are thinking along theselines.    Nor have we any idea whether this sort of solution would meet mr. Khrushchev&apos;s demands, though the most recent indications from moscow suggest that it might.    Clearly it would be very wrong to lethim have sight of any of the concessions which are involved in this plan in advance of real negotiation.12.    Our aims for the time being must therefore be limited:-(a) To ensuring that the door is left open to negotiation andMr. Khrushchev given no excuse for prematureunilateral action before the German elections.(b) To ensuring that the West is ready by the end ofSeptember with an agreed proposal for negotiationsor for a summit meeting. We shall have to pursue this aim with great discretion.(c) To keeping up a certain pressure on Mr. Khrushchevand strengthening our hand for eventual negotiationsby maintaining a posture of unity and strength in the alliance.13.    The latest American memorandum describes in acceptable terms the line to be pursued in the immediate future.    It suggests: -(a) Informal and quiet probing of the Soviet positionthrough the diplomatic channel in Moscow &quot;to warnof possible consequences of that position in termsof Allied military build-up, and to take advantageof any opportunities which might appear to move towards a subsequent understanding on an arrange-ment which might be acceptable&quot;.(b) Exploration of opportunities for Western politicalinitiatives &quot;at an appropriate time&quot; - depending ofcourse partly on Soviet moves and partly on the timetable of the German elections.-5-
The United Nations and public opinion14.    If it becomes evident that no serious negotiation can bo undertaken,or if serious negotiation appears abbut to break down, we shall have toconsider methods of establishing a favourable position with public opinion and with the United Nations.    It may indeed be necessary to bring theUnited Nations in at an earlier stage.    It has been suggested, forexample, that the United States Government would want to associate theUnited Nations in some way with any offer of negotiation.    There is alsothe certainty that if the Berlin crisis began to look really dangerous,neutral governments would not be lacking to bring it before the united nations as a threat to the peace.15.    United Nations intervention would be bound to result in fullerinternational recognition of the D. D. R. and would involve a need for more flexibility by the Federal German Government than they havehitherto shown.    The tendency would be for the United Nations to put the preservation of world peace above the interests of the WestBerliners and above Allied rights in Berlin and there would be a dangerof the United Nations endorsing situations unacceptable to the West andcondemning any Western counter action.16.    On the other hand, a properly timed and directed Westerninitiative in the United Nations might be effective in getting world publicopinion on our side.    The Russians are on balance likely to takeconsiderable account of world public opinion as expressed in the united nations, provided that what they regard as vital Soviet interests aresatisfied.    Moreover, it might well be easier to persuade the WestGerman Government to accept a compromise German settlement if thisoriginated in the United Nations and was acquiesced in rather thanpromoted by the Western Powers.17.    We must therefore assume that, unless a settlement is reached with the Soviet Union before the Berlin crisis becomes acute, the united nations will become involved in one way or another and we may find ourselves obliged to consider taking an initiative ourselves at theappropriate moment.10. Concurrently with action in the United Nations we might want toput forwar alternative &quot;solutions&quot; of the Berlin problem, not because we expected them to be accepted but in order to show a reasonable and constructive attitude.    Such arguments might include:-(a) A free city of all Berlin, with free access from East and west and a corridor, under United Nations gxiarantee.(b) A plebiscite in all Berlin.(c) Transfer of the United Nations Headquarters to Berlin,and establishment of a United Nations city.Devices such as the Brandt plan for a conference of the ex-enemies ofGermany should also be borne in mind.Foreign Office, S.
