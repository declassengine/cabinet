(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPEP.TY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(6l) 13922nd September, 1961TRANSPORT BILL - HOTELS company memorandum by the Minister of transport in the White Paper we said that the Hotels should be separated from the Railways.      The White Paper (Cmnd. 1248) on the reorganisation of the Nationalised Transport Undertakings stated in paragraphs 23 and 24that the British Transport Hotels would be incorporated as a Company underthe Companies Act, 1948 and placed under the control of the Holding Company.2.        The main objects of this proposal were:-(i) To increase the hotels&apos; commercial freedom and remove them from the overriding influence of railway requirements.(ii) To allow the British Railways Board to concentrate on their main task of running the railways.3.        Dr. Beeching wants to keep the Hotels with the Railways.   explained to the Economic Policy Committee that the Chairman of the british transport Commission, Dr. Beeching, feels strongly that these hotels shouldbe controlled by the British Railways Board.   They invited me to askDr. Beeching to reconsider this proposal;  if he adhered to it, I was to put the matter to the Cabinet.4.        I have discussed the question again with Dr. Beeching.   Forthe following reasons we agree that the Railways   should keep the- Hotels:-(a) Commercially it will be an advantage for the Hotels to remain with the Railways.    Dr. Beeching does not think that, if the hotels are runas a separate company, ownership by the Railways Board will prevent them from being operated and managed efficiently.   Nor will it divert the railways board from their main task.   On balance, it will be better commerciallyfor the Hotels Company to be controlled by the British Railways Board.   Manyof the hotels are physically part of the railway stations.   Practical difficulties might arise, particularly over development, unless ultimate control rested with the Railways Board.(b) The Hotels have been run as one organisation with the Railwaycatering services .      The common services employed save as much as 250,000 a year.   The Railway catering services will of course be a separateentity from the Hotels Company.   But it will be easier to retain the existingeconomies if both bodies come under one Board.COPY NO.CABINET-1-SICilT

(c) We should take the views of the Railway Trade Unions intoaccount.    They are of course opposed in principle to the separation   ofthe hotels from the railways.   In addition, the hotels&apos; staff are at presentcovered by the established machinery for the negotiation of wages and termof employment for railway staff.   They are also members of the samepension and superannuation schemes.   Placing the Hotels Company underthe Holding Company would remove the hotels&apos; staff from the negotiating machinery.   Under the superannuation proposals which have been worked out and discussed with the Unions, staff who are already members ofthe railway superannuation and pension schemes would be able to continue in those schemes.   But new staff would not be eligible to join.   this anomaly might well cause continuing trouble,5.        I think that these considerations carry ftreat weight.    Myconclusion   is that, while there should be a Hotels Company, it should goto the British Railways Board.   I hope my colleagues will agree.E. M.Ministry of Transport, S. S. 1.21st September, 1961
