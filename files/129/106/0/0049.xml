THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENnC. (61) 1493rd October, 1961CABINETBERLINMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsMy colleagues may like to have my impressions of the Berlinsituation following the Foreign Ministers&apos; meeting in Washington and theconsultations I have had with the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Ruskand the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Gromyko, in New York.2. When the Washington talks began there was a very real risk ofinterference with traffic in the air corridors.    Searchlights had beenflashed in the eyes of pilots landing aircraft, and other indications that theRussians might well test our determination to keep the routes open led toa high degree of tension.3. It was necessary to send the sternest warnings to the Russians.At the same time we established a precise code of rules of reaction todifferent types of interference which could be operated by the SupremeAllied Commander Europe, General Norstad.    The warnings wereeffective and since then there have been no attempts to impede traffic.4. The Foreign Ministers1 meeting was held at a very awkward timeas it was not possible to get far into the substance of a negotiating positionjust before the German elections.    Most of the time was spent ondifferent aspects of contingency planning, the most important elements ofwhich were:-(a) the procedures for dealing with interference with accesswhich I have mentioned above;(b) economic measures which have now been put before theNorth Atlantic Council for consideration; and(c) wider military schemes for action of a conventionalnature which might be taken if the East Germans orRussians tried to take over West Berlin.5. There has been a notable shift in American thinking in the lastfew months and priority is now given to a garrison airlift plus someeconomic measures over operations by land forces which could, if accessroutes were totally blocked, lead to an economic embargo.-1-COPY NO. d SECRET
SECRET6. Studies are proceeding of a number of possibilities from landprobes to naval blockade but so far no very convincing schemes have beenfound.7. The United States President&apos;s reason for continuing to press forforces of the North Atlantic Alliance to be brought up to strength is toface the Russians with a land force which could do something veryunpleasant to East Germany, although he admits that the soldiers do notyet know what it would be.    His reason for studying all possibilities,including an economic embargo and a naval blockade, is that he thinksevery economic and military deterrent should be tried so that therewould be a series of chances for the Russians to cry off before the nuclearbombs fell.    There is a considerable undercurrent of criticism of theUnited Kingdom because they feel we are hanging back in the preparationsof these economic and military postures.    A lot of young men are beingcalled up in America and their civilian lives disrupted.    Americans arebeginning to ask why we are not bringing our troops up to strength inGermany and why, if they are willing to suffer inconvenience, we are not.This situation could become dangerous and needs very careful handling.8. Simultaneously, the Americans have moved very fast towards anegotiation.    I am amazed how far they have come even in the last threeweeks.    Mr. Rusk, acting on the President&apos;s instructions, is ready to go avery long way in a negotiated settlement.    He is clearly going to put themaximum pressure on the Germans to co-operate in de facto recognitionof the &quot;German Democratic Republic&quot; and about the Oder-Neisse line.He is thinking seriously of some scheme of thinning out of divisions andlimitation of nuclear weapons on each side of the East-West Germanfrontier, but in his talks with Mr. Gromyko this has been a bait which isheld out as possible after the conclusion of a deal on Berlin.    He hashandled his talks with Mr. Gromyko firmly but sympathetically and theatmosphere of the meetings has been friendly and correct.9. At the outset of the contacts with Mr. Gromyko in New York,Mr. Gromyko stood firm on the extreme Soviet position.    He presentedtwo alternatives to the West.    The Russians would prefer it if the Westwould agree to a peace settlement with the two separate German States,establishing a free city of West Berlin.    In these circumstances, accessto West Berlin would be guaranteed by the Soviet Government in thesense that they would be a co-signatory to the peace settlement.    On theother hand, if the West refused this, there would be a unilateral treatybetween the Soviet Government and the &quot;German Democratic Republic&quot;,following which the Soviet Government would disown any furtherresponsibility for access and the West would have to deal direct with theChairman of the East German Council of State, Herr Ulbricht.10. Both Mr. Rusk and I sought to bring home to Mr. Gromyko thatthe West could not agree to the first course and that the second coursewould involve acute danger of a clash.    A different way out wouldhave to be found by direct negotiation between the West and the SovietGovernment.    By the time of his last meeting with Mr. Rusk on30th September, Mr. Gromyko had come round to &quot;not excluding&quot; somesuch possibility.    However, a direct deal with the Soviet Governmentcould not, he insisted, cover only matters of interest to the West suchjas access, but must also comprehend matters of interest to the otherside.SECRET
SECRET11. Mr. Gromykospelt out to me what these other matters would be(although he was careful to say that they were not necessarily an exclusivelist).    They are:-(&amp;)   Frontiers.    Recognition by the West of the Oder-Neisseline and of the present border between East and WestGermany as permanent frontiers.(b) Recognition of the &quot;German Democratic Republic11.Mr. Gromyko referred to this as &quot;respect for theSovereignty of the &apos;German Democratic Republic111,but refused to be drawn as to exactly what thisinvolved as regards de facto or de jure recognition.(c) 11 Militarism in West Germany&quot;.    Here again,Mr, Gromyko was not specific but it must be assumedthat the Soviet Government would press forrestrictions on armaments covering nuclear weaponsin particular.(d) West Berlin.    Mr. Gromyko was insistent that theoccupation status must go and, although he admittedto Mr. Rusk that the &quot;German Democratic Republic&quot;would not have sovereignty over an independent WestBerlin, there would clearly be insistence upon reducingthe Western forces to ntoken&quot; status, both in numbersand in ability to support the civil power (which theRussians would describe as &quot;intervening in internalaffairs&quot;).Mr. Gromyko showed a certain interest in the possibility of somereciprocal arrangement between the North Atlantic Alliance and the WarsawPact and also referred to a Soviet contribution to the garrison of WestBerlin, but it is doubtful whether these two points are more thantrimmings.12. It begins to look for the first time therefore (and this is alsoMr. Ruskfs impression) that there is a possibility of an agreement withthe Russians, which involves accepting neither of the two extremes intheir position.    It would be based on tacit Western acceptance of aunilateral treaty to be concluded subsequently between the Soviet Govern-ment and the &quot;German Democratic Republic&quot; and it would include aSoviet guarantee of continued access to West Berlin.    But the pricedemanded for this by the Russians remains very high.    The negotiationof such a deal may well be extremely difficult, and success willcertainly be conditional upon the West showing very great determinationand strength.13. Mr. Gromyko seems to like this method of negotiation andMr. Rusk is to consult him next week as to how best to carry thingsforward.-3-SECRET
SECRET14. There are dangers for Mr. Rusk in going too far alone and thisweek he will have to consult the French and the Germans. That will betricky.     He will consult us before he does anything else with them.15. The Russian time-table for signing their treaty with the &quot;GermanDemocratic Republic&quot; has not shortened:  indeed, there are signs that ifserious negotiations get under way it might be lengthened.16. Now that I have got clear of the endless talking involved both inWashington and New York, I have one overriding impression.Mr. Gromyko placed continuous emphasis upon what he called &quot;respectfor the sovereignty of the East German Government&quot;.    The question iswhat degree of de facto dealings the Germans can be persuaded to livewith.    I think they will not be too difficult but the next step for Mr. Ruskmust be to make contact with the Federal German Chancellor,Dr. Adenauer, and find out.H.Foreign Office, S.W.I.2nd October, 1961._4-SECRET
