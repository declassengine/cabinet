(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT;C.(61) 14125th September, 1961CABINETWAGES COUNCILSMemorandum by the Minister of labour I seek the approval of my colleagues for the way in which I proposeto deal during the &quot;pause&quot; with proposals of Wages Councils to increasestatutory minimum wages.2.        I cannot amend the proposals of a Wages Council and, although Imay refer them back, I could not properly do this more than once on thesame grounds.    Subject only to this power to refer a proposal back I am bound to make a statutory Order to give effect to them, and it would beimproper for me to delay doing so.     But when I make the Order I have to specify a subsequent operative date, and the Council cannot make anyproposal about this date.    For practical reasons the date is normally setfrom one to two months after I have received the proposals, the delaydepending on the amount of printing to be done and the time required to post notices in employers&apos; premises, but the Statute does not specifythese or any other factors to be taken intoaccount.    I am advised that Ican defer the operative date by a longer period than usual.    To increasethe time between receipt of proposals and the operative date of the Orderfrom a &quot;normal&quot; two months to, say, six months would not make it likely that the Courts would hold that I had failed in my statutory duty,but to enlarge the period to nine or twelve months would encourage anattempt to secure a legal decision against me.3.        With the agreement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer I have drawn the attention of all Wages   Councils known to be considering wage claims to the terms of his statement of 25th July in the House ofCommons.4.        I also referred back for re-consideration in the light of theChancellor&apos;s statement two proposals which reached me after the state-ment had been made, although the Councils had agreed upon thempreviously.     The proposals have now been unanimously confirmed by both sides of the two Councils, in each case the first reason givenbeing that they had reached agreement well before the Chancellor&apos;sstatement and therefore considered themselves committed.     The firstCouncil, which deals with Industrial and Staff Canteens, considered thewages claim at a meeting on 10th May, agreed on their proposals on 9th June and, having published them and considered representationsat a meeting on 9th August, sent the proposals to me on 10th August.COPY NO.SECHIT
The second Council, which deals with Waste Reclamation, considered awages claim on 14th June, agreed upon their proposals at the same meet-ing and sent them to me on 2nd August after confirming them at ameeting that day.5.        I have now received the proposals of the Road Haulage Council.In confirming their proposals on 21st September they considered theChancellor^ statement and said that they were committed by the agree-ment reached at their meeting on 6th July.6.        Four other Councils will in due course claim a prior commit -ment of the same kind, but of these two are likely to propose only re-definitions and not specific wage increases, and one will have to rely onagreement between the two sides before the Council met - which I cannot accept as a commitment of the Council.    No other Council will have prior commitment arising out of formal agreement in the Council before25th July.7.        The immediate question is what deferment I should provide insetting the operative dates in the Orders giving effect to the proposalsof the Wages Councils which can reasonably claim some element ofcommitment.    My power to set operative dates has not previously been used in this way and the possibility does not appear to have been recognised.    Use of it to support the policy of the wages pause will certainly be resented.    It will be said that I am ignoring the intention ofParliament, and also that I am holding back improvements in theconditions of workers who are recognised as ill-organised, in need ofprotection and lagging behind their fellows.    But I see no alternative ifthe pause is not to be breached by statutory Orders enforced by Govern-ment Inspectors.    I have the justification that a Wages Council cannot be fully committed until after the statutory interval for representationsand the final meeting to consider any that are received.8.        I must bear in mind, however, that there is strong feeling onthe subject of commitments, and indeed members of the two sides of theseCouncils have ground for considering that they are personally committed.Moreover, the system tends to work slowly, and two of the claims now inquestion were first received in March.    I believe the right course is toset a single operative date for this group of proposals which is earlier than we might choose if we were thinking only of the duration of thepause, and to state plainly that this date relates to the specialcircumstances and not to the end of the pause.    I think 1st January, 1962,would be the appropriate date.    It would be about four months on averageafter I received the proposals, but only about two months later thanthe date I would normally have prescribed.9.        When I have disposed of this group of proposals, I shall haveto consider the final group coming from Councils that had reached no agreement before 25th July.     These will begin to arrive next month.The date that I set for them will inevitably be interpreted as indicating the end of the pause.    But I need not settle that date just yet, and I shall consider in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and inthe light of developments how much later it could be.     Even if it were
only a few weeks later we should be able to distinguish between the two groups, which would be right on merits and useful in helping towards a gradual ending of the pause rather than a sudden rush on a single fixed date.10.      I propose to tell both the Trades Union Congress and the british employers&apos; Confederation What I intend shortly before making the firstOrders.    I expect a strong reaction from the former and I shall do better to meet it rather than wait for it.J.H.Ministry of Labour, S.W.T.25th September, 1961.-3-glCRIT
