(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(6l) 13616th September, 1961CABINETECONOMIC PLANNINGMemorandum by the Prime MinisterFollowing earlier discussion in the Economic Policy Committee,the Chancellor of the Exchequer forwarded to me a draft letter which he proposed to send to representatives of both sides of industry about his proposals for economic planning.2.        My own view is that, in our present economic circumstances, itis extremely important that any attempt to enlist the co-operation ofindustry in a new approach to the problems of economic planning should carry real conviction.    For this purpose, I think that we need to proposethat the new consultative body, under the Chairmanship of the Chancellorof the Exchequer, should be supported by the establishment of a high gradeplanning staff in an office which, while it would be linked with and would use the information and other services of the Government machine, wouldhave a considerable measure of independence and authority.3.        I have accordingly made a number of changes in the draft letter,and now circulate the attached revision for consideration by the cabinet at their next meeting.COPY NO. hpH. M.Admiralty House, S. W. 1.15th September, 1961.
ANNEXREVISED DRAFT OF LETTER FROM THECHANCELLOR. OF THE EXCHEQUER TO THETWO SIDES OF INDUSTRYFollowing upon my meetings with both sides of industry about anew approach to economic planning on a national scale, I have given careful thought to the various suggestions which have been made.     Inorder to forward our joint consideration of these matters I set out inthis letter, as promised, some specific proposals.I believe that the time has come to establish new and more effective machinery for the co-ordination of plans and forecasts for themain sectors of our economy.    There is a need to study centrally the plans and prospects of our main industries, to correlate them with eachother and with the Governments plans for the public sector, and to see how in aggregate they contribute to, and fit in with, the prospects for the economy as a whole, including the vital external balance of payments.This should be of assistance in the promotion of more rapid and sustainedeconomic growth, both by the creation of a climate favourable to expansion and by directing attention to the correction of weaknesses in our economic structure.I am anxious to secure that both sides of industry, on whoseco-operation the fulfilment of our objectives must significantly depend,should participate fully with the Government in all stages of the process.I hope they would, under the arrangements proposed below, obtain a picture, more continuous and comprehensive than has hitherto been available, of the long-term problems in the development of our economy:and this should enhance the value of their advice on, and efforts in, the search for solutions.    They would also have better opportunities to helpin the moulding of the economic policies of the Government at theformative stage.Clearly, we shall need some new machinery for this work.    Ienvisage that this might take the following form.    First, I propose thecreation of a National Economic Development Council.    The Chancellorof the Exchequer would be the Chairman and one or two other Ministers,such as the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Labour,would be members.    The other members of the Council, who would beappointed by the Chancellor after appropriate consultations, would bedrawn from the trade unions and from the management side of private and nationalised industry, with perhaps some independent members.    Iwould aim at a total membership of, say, about twenty.The functions of the Council would be to consider, and if necessarycommission, studies relevant to the economic objectives which I have indicated earlier in this letter and to give advice to the Government andto industry on the policies to secure these objectives.    The council would be free   and indeed would be expected to comment on theconditions necessary for faster economic growth and on measures
whereby such conditions might be created.    Responsibility for final decisions on matters of Government policy must of course remain with theGovernment, but I have no doubt that the Councils recommendations would carry great weight, not only with the Government, but with all others concerned.    I would expect that the recommendations and advice of the Council would normally be made public:  how this could best bedone will need further discussion.The effectiveness of the Council&apos;s work would depend on theestablishment of a full-time staff of the right calibre.    To meet this, Ipropose the establishment of an Office for National Economic Developmentunder a Director of high standing to be appointed from outside the CivilService.    This office, although under the aegis of Government, wouldnot be part of the ordinary Government machine.    It would act under thegeneral direction of, and be responsible to, the Council.    The Governmentfor their part would be prepared to make available from the Civil Servicean appropriate portion of the staff.    I would hope that the rest would bedrawn from both sides of industry, the commercial world and elsewhere.Normally individual members of the staff would be regarded as ontemporary secondment for, say, two to three years.The function of the Office would be to consult the main industries in the private sector about their plans for development and, in the lightof such consultations and of discussions with Government Departmentsabout other sectors of the economy, e.g. , the nationalised industries, toprepare, for the consideration of the Council, studies of the kindenvisaged in the second paragraph of this letter.    The Office would makethe fullest use of existing channels of information and consultation inGovernment and industry, and in the studies of particular industries would work in association with the Government Departments and other public bodies, e. g., the Iron and Steel Board and the Cotton Board,normally concerned with them.With the setting up of the new organisation, I would propose thatthe present Economic Planning Board should come to an end.    my present thought is that the National Production Advisory Council on industry might be continued but, in that event, it should in future meetless frequently.    The Minister ^f Labour&apos;s National Joint AdvisoryCouncil would continue as at present.I am writing similarly to the employers&apos; organisations     TradesUnion Congress/.    If you and they agree, I suggest that a joint meeting to discuss these proposals should be held at the Treasury on ....,.......If you would prefer a separate meeting, no doubt you will let me know.In view of the public interest in the topic, I propose, if you haveno objection, to make this letter available to the Press.    I should be grateful if you would inform me whether this would be acceptable to you.September, 1961S EE ^3 R SET
