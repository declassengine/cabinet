(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 144 COPY NO. ^6-1 t- - -   j-29th September, 1961CABINETPROPOSAL TO IMPORT DIQUjDJylETHANEMemorandum by the Minister of power on 25th September, the Committee on Coal Imports considered,without recording a decision, my proposal to accept the Gas Council&apos;plans to import methane gas from French North Africa.     The committee invited me to submit a paper to the Cabinet.The Proposal2.      The proposal is for fifteen-year linked agreements between the gas Council, &quot;Conch&quot; (an association of Shell and an American Company,Constock) and the French interests involved, to import liquefied methanefrom Arzew, near Oran.    The agreements will operate from 1963-64but the maximum import will not be reached for some time.Prices and Contract Conditions3.      At the price offered, and after all costs have been met, the sevenGas Boards participating in the scheme will be able to produce town gasfrom methane at Sjjrd. a therm.    On the same basis, the current cost of gas made and bought   by these Boards averages 13^d. per therm.    even with the maximum escalation allowed for in the contract, the comparisonwould still be favourable.Capital Investment4.      Two tankers will be built in this country for long-term charter to British Methane (Conch and the Gas Council).     Their estimated capital cost is  10 millions, which will be found from private sources in Britainor elsewhere, net from the gas industry.    The industry&apos;s only capital investment will be the Canvey Island terminal, the new pipelines in britain, and the Area Boards&apos; expenditure on reforming plants, etc.The estimated gross capital investment is a total of  19 millions, ofwhich  8 millions will be spent in 1962-63, a further  10 millions by1965-66 and the rest by 1969-70.     These figures are not, however, netadditions to the industry&apos;s existing capital development programmesbecause the scheme will use or displace other projects already planned to the extent of some  6 millions by 1965-66 and  10. 5 millions by1969-70.5.      The expected yield on gross capital invested (including a full allowance for working capital) is 32 per cent in 1965-66 and 37 per cent-1-
in 1969-70.    Even after adjustment for the maximum escalation allowed for in the contract, the yields will be 14 per cent and 15 per cent respectively.Revenue Improvement6.      Compared with the anticipated position of the industry under existing plans, net revenue will be increased in 1969-70 by  2.6 millions a year.    This seems small compared with Gas Boards&quot; total sales, but is of the greatest importance to the industry in its present trading position.Its surplus last year was just over  2 millions.    In the two previous years the industry was in deficit.Technical Merits7.      Methane enjoys a number of technical advantages over othergases, and the proposed scheme would open, to the industry, world reserves of methane   estimated at not much less than the total reserves ofpetroleum.     The scheme would employ a new technology which britain has played a leading part in developing.    Its further development wouldhave a most important effect on the gas industry and its contractors, andwould be of considerable potential value for our shipping and shipbuilding.Other Possible Raw Materials8.     Recent offers of virgin naphtha, propane and butane from over-sea refineries, at prices lower than any previously paid by the gas council, have almost certainly been stimulated by the methane proposals.Some of the prices are attractive, but the offers cover a wide price range and the information I have about them has made it difficult to judge whether completely satisfactory contracts could be secured.    I do notthink these materials at present offer an alternative to the methaneproposals.The National Coal Board9.      The Chairman of the National Coal Board wants the decision onmethane deferred until the B:.ard and the Gas Council have togetherworked out the costs of large scale Lurgi gas production.    He apparentlyfears that an approval for liquid methane means the end of Lurgi.    Iam sure this is a mistake.    The establishment of such a plant, far from being prejudiced by the methane proposals, would in fact be made easierby them because the ideal enricher and the high pressure pipe-linewould be available,Security of Supply10.    The Gas Council have taken account of the risks involved inimporting methane from Algeria.    Even if the Boards were deniedmethane during periods of peak load, they could use different petroleumfeedstocks or make replacement gas in standby plant.    It now seems likely that underground storage can be introduced at the same time asthe methane scheme, and one cavity at Winchester could hold fourteenweeks&apos; supply of methane.    I am satisfied that the industry could not-2-
only meet the needs of consumers during temporary interruptions ofsupply, but could also cope with a long-term loss of methane, unless therewere a prolonged general stoppage of our oil supplies.    Undergroundstorage would still give the industry as much security as any user ofother imported fuels is likely to have.Balance of Payments11.     By 1965-66 methane would displace 800,000 tons of coal and400, 000 tons of oil.     The net foreign exchange cost of methane might by then be  4 millions a year, or about 3d. a therm, assuming that all the oil products displaced are produced from British refineries.     To theextent that they might be imported as products, the additional foreign exchange cost of the methane would be less.     There might be indirectgains later from the two methane tankers to be built in Eritish yards, ifConch acquires other international traffic in methane, and if Britishshipyards are better able as a result of the scheme to tender for similarvessels.Conclusions and Recommendations12.    It would run directly counter to the policy expressed in thisspring1 s White paper (Cmnd. 1337) to restrict the commercial freedomof the gas industry (which carries a public investment of over  500 millionwithout powerful reasons.     The Select Committee on nationalised industries, in their report published in August, have emphasised the need of the Gas Industry for cheaper gas at the earliest possible moment(paragraph 441).     The Committee feel that a substantial reduction in costto all Boards depends on large-scale national production, backed by anational grid and helped by underground storage (paragraph 482).    Thescheme to import liquefied methane is a bold move in this direction and,as the Select Committee point cut (paragraph 483), is much further aheadthan any scheme for large scale gasification of coal by Lurgi, whichwould anyhow require substantial imports of some kind of enricher.13.    I am most anxious that the scheme should go forward and i therefore propose, if the Cabinet agree, to approve the scheme andannounce my decision as soon as Parliament reassembles.R. F.
