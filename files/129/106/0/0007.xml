(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 107 COPY NO. * V19th July, 1961CABINETPUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer ask my colleagues to approve the various proposals set out inthis paper, some of which I shall wish to announce on Tuesday, 25th July.Investment in 1962-19632.     I have circulated separately the officials&apos; review (C. (61) 106) and propose that we endorse the figures for 1962-63 in A.appendix B of that papen;with the following amendments(i) Nationalised industries.   I have asked the Ministers concerned to approach the various industries asking them to avoid expenditure whereverthis can be done without damage to the central objectives of provision of essential supplies and services, and the attainment of their financial targets.(ii) Education.   Reduction in the Ministry&apos;s 1962-63 figure from 132. 9 millions to  116 millions, and in the Scottish Education Departmentsfigure from  18 millions to  15 millions.(iii) Housing.   Reduction in the Ministry&apos;s 1962-63 figure from 240 millions to, say,  225 millions.   The Minister has agreed toreduce his approvals from 110, 000 in 1961 to 100, 000 in 1962 (I have agreedto a small reserve for use in case of great need, unless the economic position is very bad).   Reduction in the Scots&apos; figure for  43 millions to 42 millions.   It is for consideration whether the Secretary of state should impose control over Scottish housing.(iv) Small local government services.   I have agreed that the Ministerof Housing should have a further figure of  4 millions to enable advancepurchases of land to be continued.   I shall also announce that it v/ill notbe possible to take action on the Wolfenden Report on Sport for sometime to comej  or to authorise such projects as swimming baths.   Theremay be some reduction on water and sewerage.3.     For nationalised industries, this will leave a figure of 922 millions (minus whatever they are prepared to postpone), comparedwith  881 millions this year and  864 millions in 1960-61.4.     For central and local government services, it will leave a figureof  909 millions, compared with  875 millions in 1961-62 and  773 millions in 1960-61.5.      In future, I think we should handle these groups separately, andin separate parts of the anmial &quot;White Paper.-1-SECRET
Long-Term Redeployment6. I wish to announce, apart from oversea defence and aid expenditure,two items of long-term redeployment of expenditure:-(i) The Ministry of Education projected investment expenditure for 1963-64, 1964-65 and 1965-66 is to be spread over four years insteadof three at a level of  110 millions a year;  the Scottish EducationDepartment1 s programme to be treated in the same way, the annualfigure being  12. 7 millions.(ii) The Ministry of Health and Department of Health for Scotlandcurrent expenditure (hospitals, Executive Council services and local health and welfare services) are to be kept within the increase of 80 millions for 1961-62 to 1965-66 contemplated in paragraphs 111,112, 114 and 115 of the Treasury report, but with flexibility between thevarious elements and (within moderate amounts) taking account of savings in other parts of these Votes.7.     I should like to agree a five-year road programme involving anincrease in 1966-67 to a figure far short of what is now envisaged.8.      On assistance to private industry, I intend to say &quot;In the generalfield of assistance to industry, we are at the end of a phase. The specialoperations which caused the big increase in expenditure are ending, andwe see no reason ahead for more.   New commitments for assistance could be justified only if they could be shown to make an important contribution to competitiveness and national efficiency which can besecured in no other way.   If any new proposals come forward, we shallapply this criterion stringently. &quot;9.      On agriculture, I want to say &quot;The Government are free toexercise the full powers specified in the Agriculture Act, 1957, toreduce guaranteed prices and other forms of support, and to lookcarefully at those forms of assistance which fall outside the Annual Reviewmachinery to see how expenditure on them can be prevented from growingbeyond the original estimates of their cost&quot;.Further Action10.     These two sets of measures - investment in 1962-63 and long-termredeployment for roads, education and health - must be regarded asthe first step.   In the next three or four months we must take further decisions on the folloiwng:-(i) Long-term defence budget.(ii) Long-term redployment up to 1965-66:-(a) Public investment (other than roads and education, already settled).(b) Current expenditure (Departments not yetconsidered, and re-examination of education in the light of effect of the changes in investment).(c) Criteria for   assistance for industry.-2-secret
(iii)     Estimtes for 1962-63.11.     On (i), we must get ahead as soon as we have settled the overseaexpenditure.12.    On (ii), we must haveanother report from the officials by October.13.     On (iii), I am sure that further difficult decisions are necessary.It is estimated on the basis of the Forecast Estimates submitted by departments that the 1962-63 Estimates, on present form, may be not far short of  400 millions above the 1961-62 level of  5,187 millions.   Thisis clearly out of the question.Estimates for 1962-196314.    We cannot yet decide the 1962-63 Estimates, for they will dependgreatly upon pay and prices - and how this develops will depend upon therest of our policy.   But I must certainly make a statement next Tuesdaywhich will convince public opinion, both at home and overseas, that wehave public expenditure under control and that we are simply not goingto allow it to go on rising.15.    There is advantage from a psychological or moral point of view in trying to get small administrative savings but it is important to avoid&quot;paper&quot; savings, and doing things for the sake of immediate saving whichlead   inevitably to bigger expenditures later:  this weakens control ofexpenditure.   What we must have this time is continuing savings.16.    I should like to keep the increase of Estimates for 1962-63, in real terms, to within 2\ per cent of the Estimates for 1961-62 - i. e. 125 millions.   This would be offset by the big ssvings below-the-line from the completion of financing the new steel works and the terminationof the House Purchase Scheme.17.     This will require further savings (at early 1961 pay and prices) inGovernment expenditure, over and above what has already been agreed,of at least a further  100 millions.   In so assessing it, I have assumedfull use of our powers to reduce the agricultural support bill undernext year&apos;s Price Review.   I have put defence at the level of the ForecastEstimates, although I understand that the Minister will propose a lower figure.   Whatever reduction is ultimately agreed will score towards the 100 millions.   Economies scored in oversea   administrative expenditure will also reduce this total.18.     These are savings over a relatively small area of expenditure -given the extent to which our expenditure is already committedirrevocably (e. g. the general grant, or pensions).   There is not enoughtime before the statement to go into this in detail, but in order to achieve this we shall require one of two quite large policy savings - i. e.the elimination or curtailment of particular services both in the civil andin the defence fields - and a real scrutiny of every item of expenditure.-3-
Conclusions19.    I therefore propose: -(i) Agreement to Investment Review figures  or 1962-63, as modified above.(ii) Agreement to specific items of long-term redeployment.(iii) Commissioning of further reports from officials on long-termr e deployment.(iv) Agreement to statement on 1962-63 Estimates as in paragraph 14.S. L.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.18th July, 1961
