C. (61) 150 Copy No.6th October, 1961IIICABINETTHE FUTURE OF THE AIRCRAFT industry memorandum by the Minister of aviation am deeply concerned as to the future of the aircraft industry, for which theGovernment have accepted a substantial measure of responsibility. The purposeof this paper is to describe the dangers which beset the industry and the action Iwould propose to meet them.2. The aircraft industry in the United Kingdom has, on the strength ofpledges of Government support announced in Parliament (see the statement by the then Minister of Defence, Mr. Duncan Sandys, of 15th February, 1960,reproduced at Annex A) and repeatedly reaffirmed in private, organised itself into two fixed-wing aircraft groups, two engine groups and one helicopter group. Thishas been done with some-reluctance and at great cost to the industry. Outside themain structure there remains one other Company towards whom we have special responsibilities, namely Messrs. Short Brothers and Harland Ltd. in NorthernIreland.3. The present policy was adopted after careful and prolonged consideration.The Defence White Paper of 1957 (Cmnd. 124) with its indications of a falling offin military requirements showed plainly that a determined effort to increase theUnited Kingdom share of the growing world market for civil aircraft would benecessary if the industry was to avoid a serious decline. Government expenditureon aeronautical research was at that time running at about  25 millions per annum and it was agreed that this support should continue. But in 1958 the Governmentformed the view that the industry should finance the development of all newtransport aircraft projects, other than those embodying exceptional technologicaladvance, without Government assistance. The events of the next two years showedwith increasing clarity that no civil industry of consequence was likely to be sustained on this basis. Messrs. DeHavillands incurred heavy losses on the Comet,and Messrs. Bristols on the Britannia. Even Messrs. Vickers, with their record ofsuccess on the Viscount, faced serious losses on the Vanguard and VC-10 and the manufacturers made it clear that they were no longer prepared to undertake thedevelopment of large aircraft as a private venture. The Cabinet aareed inDecember 1959 (C.C. (59) 64th Conclusions, Minute 4) that it was still in thenational interest that a substantial aircraft industry should be maintained and that increased Government help for the launching of new transport aircraft and aero-engine projects would be required for several years to come. It was estimated,though on this the then Chancellor of the Exchequer naturally reserved his position,that Government contributions to such projects would need to rise to an averageof about  20 millions per annum. This was the general background against whichthe Governmenfs decision to support, and the industry&apos;s decision to reorganise,were taken. All concerned acted with their eyes open to the facts. In arriving at the estimate of  20 millions my predecessor allowed for a possible supersonic transport aircraft project being included in the programme; but not of course,59764THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1961
since Blue Streak was at that time a defence project, for any work on satellilaunchers. The criteria to be applied in determining the amount of assistanceto be given to particular projects, as agreed by the Chancellor in November 1960,are as follows:&quot; (a) The Government may contribute towards the launching costs of a new type of aircraft under the following circumstances:ii n (i) In order to bring about the development of a project important&quot; in the national interest which it is reasonable to suppose would otherwise not take place,(ii) To assist in financing a desirable project where the financial resources and prospects of the Company are such that withoutassistance it would be unable to undertake the whole of a desirable programme, or where the risk element is so great thatthe Company could not reasonably be expected to undertake it without Government assistance.(b) Cases of assistance to enable firms to take the risk of advance productionso as to give earlier delivery dates or for more rapid proving of new types of aircraft will be judged on their merits and one of the factors tobe taken into account will be whether the assistance improves theprospects of recovering the original Exchequer investment (if any) inthe project.&quot;Assistance of this kind is manifestly necessary but the industry&apos;s own contribution is of course much larger than the Governments and imposes a heavy strain upon its resources. Some details of investment by the industry are given in Annex B.4. The industry has for some years been making a most valuable contributionto the export trade. Since 1956 (statistics at Annex C) its exports have represented on average about 9 per cent, of all this country&apos;s exports of engineering products and about 3\ per cent, of all exports. They have been rising and are now running at the rate of about  160 millions per annum (40 per cent, military: 60 per cent,civil). Most of this is net gain to the balance of payments, since the &quot; conversionfactor &quot; of these exports (i.e., the value of the completed article in proportion tothe value of imported materials it contains) is extremely high. We have been particularly successful in the aero-engine field; more than half the total numbersof gas turbine engines in operation or on order by the world airlines, for instance,are of Rolls Royce design. Competition in the aircraft industry as a whole is however becoming more and more severe and if support for the next generatiunof types is weakened these exports are bound to fall away.5. In the European scene the industry seems at first sight well placed. With299,000 employed compared with 83,000 in France, 16,000 in West Germany and about 40,000 in the rest of Europe, the United Kingdom industry is by far thelargest. It is also in general the best equipped and most advanced technologicallyand is powerfully backed by research and development in government establishments. If we play our cards right there seems no reason why we shouldnot continue to benefit from this position in the European market and elsewhere.6. Our most formidable competitor, however, is the United States and the plain fact is that United States firms are in Europe ahead of us. They have already made links with many European firms. (Examples at Annex D.) After a belatedstart our industry is trying to do the same but the handicap is severe and successwith the F-104 lighter has given the Americans a firm foot-hold which they will use to the fulF.7. Recommendations on future aviation policy in America have recentlybeen made in the report by the Administrator of the United States FederalAviation Agency, the Hon. N. E. Halaby (Halaby Report). This is known asProject Horizon and has been generally approved by the President. It recommends that the objectives for the next decade should be directed towards the maintenance,with appropriate Government support, of United States leadership of the world in all phases of aviation. We can therefore expect renewed efforts by the UnitedStates industry, with substantial Government support, to consolidate its positionand to capture new markets in Europe and the Commonwealth. The UnitedKingdom industry will have a hard struggle to hold its own, and any weakening of Government support would be fatal to our hopes of future success.
0) 8. The main danger which confronts the industry, is that decisions about future programmes and how they are to be financed may be so delayed byhesitations of various kinds that continuity of work cannot be maintained. Thishas been made particularly clear to me in recent talks with Messrs. hawker siddeley and the British Aircraft Corporation. But throughout the fields of aircraft, helicopters, rockets and engines the story is the same. In the absence offirm decisions in the near future about some new projects we shall be faced witha serious decline in the design staffs employed, inevitably followed by a run-downin the development and production resources on which our export hopes depend.Annex E shows for the two major fixed-wing aircraft groups, Messrs. hawker siddeley and the British Aircraft Corporation, the probable course of this declinein the absence of such decisions. If this were allowed to happen the industry would be in full retreat from the United States advance in Europe and throughoutthe world.9. Annex F shows the decline of expenditure on the military development programmes as at present approved. Clearly the industry cannot be given any assurance that a particular level of employment will always be maintained.Certainly we cannot give it the massive support available to its Americancompetitors through the United States defence programme. I am indeed preparedto accept that a planned reduction in present design staffs at some places may be appropriate and could reasonably flow from the amalgamations that have takenplace. What we must not allow to happen is an uncontrolled rundown causedby indecision on the part of the Government. Amid ail the talk of planning,the aircraft industry can reasonably ask the Government to decide important questions on which programmes for the next few years will depend.10. I have naturally assured the industry that the Government have no intention of going back on the policy which was agreed and announced as recently as February I960. If, however, this policy is not to be frustrated, some at least ofthe inhibitions which are holding up the formulation of future programmes mustbe removed. Moreover any economies which we may seek to impose must bewisely chosen if they are not to cause great harm. In this rapidly developingaeronautical field our ability in the future to select good projects and achieveefficiency and success in carrying them out depends more than ever on themaintenance of a vigorous programme of research. This is unlikely to cost on theaverage less than the figure of  25 millions per annum agreed in 1959 but I recognise the need for restriction and am prepared in principle to accept a limit of this orderprovided that adjustment for changed money values can be allowed. Our presentexpenditure on transport aircraft and aero engines is substantially below the 20 millions per annum mentioned in paragraph 3 above, though there are a numberof outstanding projects which if approved would take us nearer to it. I should be content to accept  20 millions as a ceiling for this class of expenditure for someyears to come. But circumstances may well arise in which it would be right to allowvirement from the development programmes (whether military or civil) to research and vice versa. I must, therefore, ask for some flexibility here and invite mycolleagues to agree.11. Both on the military and the civil sides, we must clearly seek by all meansopen to us to co-operate with others not only in Europe, but naturally also, where possible, with the United States. In no other way car. we sufficiently spread the initial costs of new projects and widen the market for the product. We have takenimportant steps towards collaboration by negotiating agreements with germany on the development of a strike reconnaissance aircraft based on the Hawker P-l 127,and with France and Germany on the development of the Rolls Royce RB-162lift engines.12. In the military field the key project in the existing programme is theTSR-2. Decisions are awaited on several major projects such as a new combat aircraft and a short take-off or vertical lift tactical transport to replace the Hastingsand the Bevcrley. The possible requirement for a multi-role military variant ofthe VC-10 is also very important. Some  36 millions is being spent in thedevelopment of this type as a civil airliner (the bulk of it. nearly  26 millions, bythe British Aircraft Corporation and the remainder by the Government) and thetotal orders so far amount to only 57. The break-even point is considerably morethan this.   If a new requirement can be met with a basic design in which a heavySECRET5&apos;)764 n 2
:- . &apos; Iinvestment has already been made we should clearly make every effort to adopt it&quot;rather than develop something completely new.13. The main fields now left for entry into a co-operative effort in Europeare vertical take-off (including helicopters), a supersonic transport aircraft andsatellite launchers. In the field of large helicopters I would propose to concentrateour efforts forthwith and urgently on the Westland Rotodyne and on preparations for introducing it. We must gain some experience of inter-city services with largehelicopters soon if we are to exploit the commercial opportunities in this project.It cannot be obtained for nothing, since all helicopter services at present run at a loss. I have the chance, if it can be taken quickly, of securing an agreement between british European Airways and Sabena for services between London, Paris andBrussels with American Vertol 107 helicopters powered with British-built Gnomeengines. The cost to the Government, i.e., not more than  500,000, would in my view be a moderate price to pay for the advantages of gaining vital operationalexperience, linking our helicopter group with Vertols, installing a British-builtengine, and establishing a link with Europe in helicopter operation which would hold out a promising future for the Rotodyne.14. The Rotodyne remains the only project which shows a real prospectof reducing the operating cost of services between city centres to an economiclevel. Provision for the necessary development and proving expenditure can bemade within the total of  20 millions per annum which I suggested as a limitin paragraph 10. I would therefore propose to proceed with the placing of a production order for the 12 Rotodynes required by the Services and already approved by Ministers, and to give British European Airways the necessaryindemnity on noise to enable them to go ahead with their order too. Withoutthe Rotodyne it is difficult to see how we can remain in the field of large civilhelicopters at all.15. Whether we like it or not, the 1970s will almost certainly see theintroduction of supersonic air travel. It does not lie in our power to impose a speed limit. The Americans are thinking in terms of an all-steel aircraft capableof Mach 3 but this is an extremely ambitious project, even for them, particularlyin view of their preoccupation with formidable missile and space programmes.A great deal of preliminary work has been done in this country on a possibledesign for a Mach 2 aircraft built in light alloy, and my technical advisers firmlybelieve that Britain has an opportunity here of gaining the leadership we sonarrowly missed with the Comet. They are confident that the Mach 2 aircraft could not only be first in the field if a resolute start were made now, but would prove more economic than an all-steel aircraft, particularly on medium-rangeroutes. It would be wrong to leave this class of aircraft entirely to the UnitedStates and Russia. I have had a talk with the French Minister of Transport,M. Buron, to explore the possibilities of Anglo-French collaboration on such a project. As a result, further studies between officials and experts of the firms concerned have been put in hand with a view to reports on both sides in a fewweeks.   I will then report further to my colleagues.16. We must be careful not to throw away the position we have gained asexporters of aero engines. The engine groups, particularly Rolls Royce, havedone a great deal themselves, but their financial resources are strained andcompetition is severe. In the past an adequate range of civil aero-engines couldbe developed as a bv-product of the military programme. This is not so to-day,and we must be prepared to invest in promising new types sometimes in advanceof an aircraft application.17. In the guided weapons section of the aircraft industry, the general patternis repeated. If timely decisions to proceed with new projects are not taken,design teams will begin to disintegrate. Even if a start is made on all the new weapons now proposed, there will be an appreciable fall in the size of developmentteams over the next few years. There is therefore nothing here to offset the threatened decline on the aircraft side.18. Finally there is the satellite launcher, which in my view is a project ofsuch great and wide-rangim? importance that we must find some way to get itfirmly on its feet with Europe if possible, alone if necessary. The Blue Streak(Ministerial) Committee discussed my proposals on this matter on 2nd October.
Ministry of Aviation, W.C.2,5th October, 1961.-0     19.   Summary(a) We are pledged to support the aircraft industry.ib) In the absence of early decisions about some future projects, there will bea rapid and uncontrolled decline in design staffs, leading in due course to a sharp fall in employment and exports.(c) This must be avoided by early decisions on a sufficient number of projects,so that a reasonable plan for the next few years can be established,aimed at ensuring that any reduction in design staffs should not lead todisintegration. A list giving examples of such projects is at Annex G.id) In deciding on new projects we should aim at collaboration with othercountries wherever practicable. We should also exploit what we havedone already and reinforce success.ie) Our civil helicopter policy should be centred upon the Rotodyne,preliminary experience being gained through the British european airways/Sabena operation of Vertol 107s.(/) The next steps towards a supersonic transport aircraft should be reviewed in the light of the studies agreed upon in my talks with M. Buron.ig) Some flexibility between expenditure on aeronautical research and on military or civil development should be permitted.ConclusionIt cannot be expected that early decisions will be possible on all the matters affecting the aircraft industry that need to be settled. On the other hand, unless some new projects are approved dire consequences for the industry will follow.A determined effort should therefore be made to reach decisions on a sufficient number of these requirements to avoid an uncontrolled run-down and to enable a reasonable plan for the next few years to be established.P.

AiNNEX ASTATEMENT BY Mr. DUNCAN SANDYSHouse of Commons, 15lh February, 1960. Hansard, Cols. 957-964Aircraft Industry\ The Government regard it as essential that the United Kingdom should maintain a strong and efficient aircraft industry, capable not only of providing the Armed Forces with aircraft and guided weapons, but also of playing a prominent part in the world-wide development of civil aviation.On my appointment as Minister of Aviation, four months ago, I discussed theposition with the aircraft industry. I expressed to it the view that the increasingcost and complexity of modern aeroplanes, together with the intensification offoreign competition, now made it necessary for manufacturers to possess muchgreater financial and technical resources than hitherto. For this reason, I suggestedthat they might consider creating stronger units by the amalgamation of suitablefirms. I explained that the pattern I had in mind would consist of five majorgroups two making fixed-wing airframes and guided weapons, one makinghelicopters, and two making aero-engines.I found a ready acceptance of the need for radical reorganisation; and I wishto express to the industry my appreciation of the prompt manner in which it hasacted. In fact, the initial process of re-grouping is now virtually completed, though,naturally, much remains to be done by the new groups to consolidate and rationalisetheir resources.The sharp reduction in Government orders for military aircraft, which represents such a large part of the industry&apos;s business, has made it urgently necessaryto expand sales of civil types at home and overseas; and the Government havebeen considering ways of helping manufacturers adjust themselves to this changed situation.In order to provide a sound technological foundation, the Government willfor the present continue to maintain a substantial programme of aeronautical research.Except where specialised requirements or public policy make it necessary todo otherwise, we intend to concentrate Government orders on the five majorgroups. At the same time, we shall seek to harmonise the characteristics of militaryand civil types of transport aircraft.In view of the growing importance of the civil market, the Government havedecided to provide increased support, where appropriate, for promising civil aircraft projects and aero-engines. The nature and extent of the assistance will vary. TheGovernment may contribute towards the development, tooling or other initial costs of launching a new type. Tn order to enable earlier delivery dates to be offered,the Government may also, in suitable cases, take a share in the risks involved in producing a limited number of aircraft beyond those for which firm orders havebeen received. Furthermore, the Government may be prepared to contribute towards the cost of proving a new type of civil aircraft and of introducing it intoregular airline service.Suitable arrangements will be made for the Government to participate in the proceeds from sales. The manner in which these will be shared between theGovernment and the firm will vary and will depend, among other things, uponthe proportion of the risks borne by each.Concentrated thus in a small number of strong units and adequately backed by the Government, I am confident that the British aircraft industry will nowbe better fitted to meet the needs of modern defence, and will be better able tosecure its due share of the expanding market for civil aircraft throughout the world.
