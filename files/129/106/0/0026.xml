(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 126I 1     II.   LM.II   -2nd August, 1961FUTURE RELATIONS WITH SOUTH africa memorandum by the Lord ChancellorBy direction of the Prime Minister an inter-departmentalCommittee of officials was set up in March of this year to make recommendations to Ministers on our future relations with South Africa.The question of future Departmental responsibility in Whitehall forrelations with South Africa and for the High Commission Territorieswas reserved for separate consideration.    It has submitted to theAfrica Committee a number of papers of which I need mention only-six.     Three were interim submissions on matters requiring urgentdecision - consultation with South Africa on political and economic matters;  the supply of arms;  and general defence co-operation.     Thesematters have been satisfactorily disposed of and I need not trouble mycolleagues further with them.    The other three papers are a generalreport on our future relations with South Africa;  a report on SouthAfrican sugar exports;  and a report on our tactics for discussions with the South African Government about future relations.     these have now been considered by the Africa Committee and the following paragraphs deal with those parts of them which, in the view of theCommittee, should be submitted to the Cabinet.general.      Throughout their work the officials were guided by an inter-pretation endorsed by Ministers of the general approach to future relations with South Africa which the Commonwealth Secretary hadenunciated in the House - that we should avoid continuing to giveSouth Africa &quot;Commonwealth treatment&quot; unless it appeared clearly in our interests to do so.     The Africa Committee agree with this principle, and with the flexible way in which it has been applied by the officials.COPY NO.   \cabinet.      The Committee considered that, in future, most South Africanswill have to be treated as aliens, but they were concerned about thoseSouth African citizens who had strong connections with the UnitedKingdom and might want to retain them.     The Committee feel boundto advise against an &quot;Irish solution&quot; but recommend that legislation in order to allow those South African citizens who either (i) are living in the United Kingdom or Colonies, or are in United Kingdom CrownService, or are employed by companies established in the United
Kingdom;  or (ii) although living in South Africa have connexions by-paternal descent with the United Kingdom and Colonies and who intendat some future date to live in the United Kingdom or Colonies, to register as citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies, provided thatthey apply before a certain date - the Committee recommend31st December, 1965.     This would merely be an extension for threeyears of existing provisions of the British Nationality Acts.4.      The Committee also recommend that, to allow time for adequate warning to be given to those civil servants, solicitors, etc. ,who would be statutorily barred from continuing their employmentunless they became citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies,provision should be made so as to suspend such disqualification until31st December, 1965.5.      Finally, they recommend that further consideration should begiven to the possibility of special provision for registration after31st December, 1965, of South African citizens who had through no faultof their own failed to register by that date.6.      The Committee hope that it will be possible to persuade the South African Government not to exercise against those who might thus register as citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies their powerto deprive of South African citizenship any South African citizens whovoluntarily acquire the citizenship of another country while in SouthAfrica.Economic Relations7.      Our financial and economic interests in South Africa compriseinvestments ( 900 millions), exports ( 165 millions a year) and earnings from invisibles and oil sales ( 100 millions a year).    In order tosafeguard these interests and to keep South Africa within the sterling area, the Committee recommend that we should aim at maintaining our present trade relations with South Africa as nearly as possibleunchanged.     The Ottawa Agreement governing those relations is not directly affected by South Africa&apos;s withdrawal from the commonwealth and should be of use to us in negotiating with her on these and othermatters, since under it she receives more than she gives.    If we join the Common Market we should almost certainly have to terminate our trade agreement with South Africa (although we might try to obtainderogations on her behalf) and we must be prepared to tell her so atan appropriate moment.    As this would largely destroy the value ofthe trade agreement as a general bargaining counter we should notvouchsafe such a warning prematurely, although our decision to apply for membership of the Common Market may lead South Africa toraise the question at an early stage.High Commission Territories8.      It would be much in the interests of the High commission territories for us to retain South African goodwill by being asaccommodating as possible throughout the negotiations on future-2-
relations.     The Committee recommend that our aim should be at least to keep relations between the Territories and South Africa unchangedand, if possible, to improve working arrangements.    In particular,we should try to negotiate a continuance of Part II of the FugitiveOffenders Act with two modifications - the exclusion of politicaloffences and of offences not punishable in both South Africa and theTerritory concerned.     We should also seek to improve the position ofthe Swaziland sugar industry.9.      We must also consider the South Africa Act, 1909.     The onlyproblems here relate to Sections 151 and 150 which cover the possibilityof transferring to South Africa the High Commission Territories andthe Rhodesias respectively.     The Committee consider that the onlyreal choice lies between retaining or repealing the whole Act.     these issues are at present dormant and to repeal the Act might stimulate the South Africans to raise them, which would in itself be undesirable:on the other hand, to retain the Act would probably arouse criticism inthe Territories, the Rhodesias and Parliament.     The committee recommend that a deci sion should be deferred until the progress of negotiations with the South Africans makes it possible to discern more clearly the balance of advantage between the two courses.Other Matters for Decision10.     The Committee endorse, subject to certain comments, aseries of recommendations by the officials on legislative matters, the representation of South African interests abroad, postal and telegraphmatters, the Commonwealth Area Communications Scheme and educational questions.    I do not think it necessary to trouble theCabinet with any of these matters.Sugar11.     The Committee recommend that South Africa should cease tobe a member of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement (C.S.A.) afterthe end of this year.    It is necessary to inform the South Africansugar producers of this decision at once in order that they may planaccordingly for the International Sugar Conference next month.     TheCommittee also recommend, however, that we should be prepared tonegotiate with South Africa a bilateral agreement under which we might offer to buy from her the amount of sugar guaranteed underthe C.S. A. (150,000 tons a year) at the present or future C.S.A. price,whichever was lower.     We might further agree to buy not more than another 25, 000 tons at the world price.     The agreement should lastfrom four to seven years.     The reasons for this proposal are two-fold.Its overall aim would be generally to help us in our negotiations with south Africa:   in particular, a move of this kind is probably essential in order to safeguard the Swaziland sugar industry.    Under an agree-ment between that industry and the South African industry Swazilandenjoys a guaranteed market for sugar in South Africa and someindirect benefit from the high C.S. A. price;   and we want to ensure thatthese arrangements continue and to secure for Swaziland a share ofany growth in South African consumption of sugar.     The Swazilandindustry will in any case want to know what their position will be at-3-
the end of any bilateral agreement with the South Africans, and theCommittee therefore recommend that they should be given an assurance that, if their outlet in South Africa were then reduced, the United kingdom would ensure alternative outlets to the extent of keei^mg them no worse off than previously.Tactics for Discussion12.     There are important questions of timing and procedure in relationto all these matters.     The Committee recommend that we should avoid a comprehensive negotiating conference with the South Africans andshould instead take up with them in series the various matters on which agreement is necessary.     They think that the order of discussion should be settled iri consultation with the United Kingdom ambassador in Pretoria, and that our overall aim should be to get what we wantbefore we commit ourselves, particularly on sugar.     They furtheragree with advice from the Ambassador that the discussions should be conducted through the Embassy with help from London.13.    In order that the United Kingdom legislation which will berequired on a variety of matters may be ready, as it should, to comeinto force on 31st May, 1962, the Committee recommend that we should aim to start discussions with the South Africans not later than earlyOctober and to complete them, by about mid-November.Recommendations14.     I invite my colleagues to approve the recommendations of theAfrica Committee, and particularly that:-(1)   After 31at May, 1962, South African citizens should betreated as aliens but those with certain connections withthe United Kingdom should be given until 31st December,1965, to register as citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies.(2)   We should&apos; aim to maintain our present trade relationswith South Africa so far as possible unchanged.(3)  Our aim for the High Commission Territories should beto keep relations between them and South Africaunchanged and if possible to improve working arrange-ments, including the continuance of Part II of theFugitive Offenders Act with two modifications and better arrangements for Swaziland sugar.(4)    We should leave a decision whether or not to repeal theSouth Africa Act, 1909, until discussions with theSouth Africans reveal the balance of advantage more clearly.
(5)    The South African sugar industry should be told at once that it will cease to be a member of the commonwealth sugar Agreement after this year, but we should beprepared, on certain terms, to enter into a bilateralsugar agreement with South Africa and we should alsoreassure the Swaziland sugar industry about its futureafter the end of any such agreement.(6)    We should avoid a comprehensive negotiating conference with the South Africans and should instead take up withthem in series, through the United Kingdom Embassy inPretoria, the matters requiring agreement, our object being to get what we want before committing ourselves,especially on sugar.(7)     We should try to open negotiations by early October andto conclude them by mid-November.K.House of Lords, S. W. 1.2nd August, 1961 .
