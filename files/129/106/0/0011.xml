SECRET103*1 O(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE property  OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTEUROPE:   TALKS WITH THE NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIAN&quot; AND CANADIAN GOVERNMENTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations in the past three weeks I have had talks with the New Zealand,Australian and Canadian Governments about the possibility of Britainjoining the European Economic Community.     The Press statementsissued at the end of each of these talks are  attached.2.      These statements tended to highlight the differences and did not reflect the very friendly atmosphere in which the talks were conducted,particularly in New Zealand and Australia.     This was in part due to thefact that both the Australian and Canadian Governments are expectinga General Election during the next few months and thought it politicallynecessary to make it clear that they had stood up firmly for their countries&apos; interests.3.      The reactions of all three Governments followed the lines of their earlier statements, except that in our confidential talks thay put moreemphasis on the political and less upon the economic consequences than   had expected.4.      They undoubtedly have an undefined fear that a close economic union between Britain and the other countries of Western Europe will lead in one way or another to a political union which would weaken theCommonwealth relationship.5.      In addition to this general anxiety,, the Canadian Governmenthave the additional fear that any loosening of Commonwealth ties wouldmake it more difficult for Canada to prevent herself from being suckedinto the economic orbit of the United States.6.      I naturally assured them that we had no thought of allowing our political identity to be submerged in a European super state and that, ifa wider political association became necessary, we would be more likely to favour the larger concept of an Atlantic Union than any purelycontinental system.     I also pointed out that by joining military alliancesCanada, Australia and New Zealand had, like Britain, to some extentgiven up their full freedom of action in the most important politicalsphere, namely defence.     Yet it had never been suggested that Canada&apos;s membership of N. A. T. O, , or Australia&apos;s and New Zealand&apos;s member-ship of S. E. A. T. O. and A. N. Z. U. S., was in any way incompatible withtheir membership of the Commonwealth.C. (61) 11121st July, 1961CABINET
7.      On the economic side all three countries were naturally worriedabout the possible consequences for their trade.     It was clear that new Zealand would be utterly ruined if Britain joined the common market without making far-reaching arrangements to maintain an outlet for New Zealand lamb and butter.    I assured the New Zealand Govern-ment that we well understood their position and they decided that their best course was to trust Britain not to let them down.    They naturallyemphasised the importance of maintaining unrestricted duty-free entry into the British market.    However, in the Press statement they agreedto say that they would be prepared to examine other methods of securing a comparable outlet for their produce.8.      The Australian and Canadian Governments explained the serious damage which their trade would suffer if no special safeguards were provided;  and they made it clear that they were not optimistic aboutthe prospects of negotiating satisfactory arrangements.     Yet neitherGovernment argued that they had a right to prevent Britain from enter-ing the Common Market, if she were convinced that it was in her best interests to do so.9.     All three Governments especially recognised that, notwithstanding the interests of other Commonwealth countries, the decision must rest with Britain.10.    I emphasised that we had as yet reached no decision and wouldnot do so until we had carefully considered the views of the Common-wealth.    Yet there is no doubt that all three Governments expect thatwe shall shortly decide to open negotiations without further consultationwith them.11.     There is no doubt that the three Governments much appreciated the thoroughness with which they were consulted, and I assured themthat if negotiations were started we would continue to consult them closelyat all stages.     The Australian Government expressed the strong desireto be represented directly in any negotiations affecting their interests.While realising that this was not a matter which the British Governmentcould decide, they hoped that we would do our best to arrange this forthem.12.     It is perhaps worth adding that in all these countries the Press(including leading Government newspapers) showed a remarkable under-standing for the arguments which have led Britain to consider joining the Common Market, and in some cases strongly criticised their governments for trying to hold us back.13.     From the above it will be seen that so far as New Zealand,Australia and Canada are concerned, there is nothing to prevent us, ifwe so wish, from opening negotiations with the European economic community.     The three Governments expect us to do so and will be quite surprised if we do not.D. S.Commonwealth Relations Office,S. W. 1.20th July, 1961.Cd *&quot;
/NOT FOE PUBLICATION, BROADCAST.  OR USE ON CLUBTAPES BEFORE 0030 hours on Thursday July 6th 1961.COMMON_MARKETU.K.  - NEW ZEALAND JOINT COMMUNIQUE,.The following Communique has been agreed between New ZealandMinisters and Mr. Duncan Sandys, Secretary of State for commonwealth relations,  in Wellington:The Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr. Holyoake, and otherNew Zealand Ministers have during the last four days had discus-sions with the British Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations,Mr, Duncan Sandys.Mr. Sandys explained that the British Government were con-cerned about the future consequences, both economic and political,of continued division in Europe and were therefore re-examiningtheir relationship with the European Economic Community.      Beforedetermining their attitude they were seeking the views of other commonwealth Governments.The New Zealand Ministers stated that while they supported the objective of economic and political unity in Europe, they had tohave regard to the effects of possible developments upon New Zealand&apos;economic well-being.      They emphasised that their agriculture, whichwas New Zealand&apos;s basic industry, had.been developed to supply theBritish market, and that New Zealand&apos;s economy was highly dependenton the sale of foodstuffs in that market at remunerative prices.They therefore stressed the grave consequences for New Zealand&apos;economy if Britain should joim the Common Market without having taken steps to protect New Zealand&apos;s vital interests.Mr. Sandys assured them that the British Government fully under-stood the dependence of New Zealand&apos;s agriculture on the british market.     At the same time it had to be recognised that even ifBritain did not join the Common Market, New Zealand might in anycase be faced with difficult problems in finding outlets for itsincreasing agricultural production.      There were limits to the british market.     Mr. Sandys said that the British Government had not yetcome to any decision whether or not to enter into negotiations tojoin the Common Market, and would not do so until the views of all commonwealth countries had been fully considered.     He made it clearthat in the course of any such negotiations the British Governmentwould seek to secure special arrangements to protect the vital interests of New Zealand and other Commonwealth countries, and that britain would not feel able to join E.E.C. unless such arrangements were secured.The New Zealand Ministers made it clear that they could not atpresent see any effective way of protecting New Zealand&apos;s vital interests other than by the maintenance of unrestricted duty free entry.Mr. Sandys explained the difficulties of reconciling unrestrictedduty free entry into Britain for all New Zealand!s exports with the concept of the Common Market, and said that it might therefore benecessary in any negotiations to explore other methods of securingcomparable outlets for New Zealand exports.      The New ZealandMinisters said that while adhering to the views they had expressedthey would be willing to examine any such alternative methods forprotecting New Zealand interests which might emerge in the courseof the negotiations.     Until specific proposals had been put forwardthey would necessarily have to reserve their position./Mr. Sandys
- 2 -Mr. Sandys gave an assurance that if Britain entered into negotiations with the European Economic Community the New zealand government and other Commonwealth Governments would be closelyconsulted on all matters affecting their interests before and duringthe negotiations, and that arrangements would be made for theresults to be thoroughly discussed with them before the BritishGovernment took any decision to join the European Economic Community.The New Zealand Ministers welcomed the assurances that Mr.Sandys had given, namely that the.New Zealand Government would be closely consulted before and during any negotiations;    that in anysuch negotiations the British Government would seek to securespecial arrangements to protect the vital interests of New Zealand;that Britain would not feel able to join the European Economic Com-munity unless such arrangements were secured;    and that the resultsof any negotiations would be thoroughly discussed with the NewZealand Government before the British Government took a decisionto join the European Economic Community.     In the light of these assurances they informed Mr. Sandys that they would understand it if, after considering the views of Commonwealth countries, theBritish Government should open negotiations with the european economic Community.      In that event New Zealand would be prepared .to participate in the subsequent consultations envisaged.5th July 1961
COMMON MARKETU.K./AUSTRALIA JOINT COMMUNIQUE._JULY 11th 1961.The Prime Minister of Australia, Mr. Menzies, and other AustralianMinisters have during the last few days had discussions with theBritish Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Mr. Duncan Sandys,Mr. Sandys explained the various considerations which had led theBritish Government to re-examine its attitude towards, and relationship with, the European Economic Community (the Common Market) establishedby the Treaty of Rome.In the course of several meetings the political and economic implications of such a step were fully discussed.The Australian Government considered that should Britain join theEuropean Economic Community it might well be that she will become increasingly involved in not only the economic policies of theCommunity, but also in matters of an international and political kind.Mr. Sandys emphasised that the British Government was convinced thatthe objective of closer unity in Europe was in no way incompatible withthe maintenance and further development of Commonwealth ties which constitutes a valuable unifying influence in a much divided world.Australian Ministers pointed out that they thought the ultimatepolitical implecations of the Treaty of Rome are extremely signi-fleant and will tend to possess a developing character in the achieve-?ment of some kind of European unity.      They saw merit in such unitysince a continuing division in rival economic groups would be a source of danger and weakness, while a powerful and experienced group of free European nations can do much to preserve the world&apos;s peace.However, they emphasised that    although avoidance of a divided western europe was a desirable objective,  it should not be accomplished atthe cost of division within the Commonwealth or elsewhere in the free world.   Australian. Ministers expressed their concern at the weaken-ing effect they believed this development would have on the Common-wealth relationship.Mr. Sandys stressed the importance the United Kingdom attaches to maintaining this relationship unimpaired.      Indeed, the BritishGovernment believed that &amp; closer association of Britain with thecontinent of Europe might well be an added source of strength notonly to Britain but to the Commonwealth as a whole.Full exchanges occurred on the economic advantages and dis-advantages which would ensue if Britain were to accede to the Treatyof Rome, and the possible effects of this on the trade and industry of Britain and Australia.      It was recognised that the issue of Bri-tain!s accession to the Treaty of Rome was primarily a matter for britain and was one which the British Government alone could decide,but Australian Ministers explained the serious adverse consequences for Australian producers and for the Australian balance of payments which would confront Australia if the United Kingdom were to enter the Common Market on a basis which failed to safeguard Australianinterests for the future./Mr. Sandys
Mr. Sandys assured the Australian Government that the BritishGovernment fully shared its concern to maintain the long-establishedflow of trade between their two countries.      If negotiations took place,the intention would be to secure special arrangements to protect these important trading interests.Mr. Sandys made it clear that he did not ask the Australian Govern-ment to express an opinion on the question whether Britain should join the Common Market.      The British Government itself had as yet reachedno decision on this issue.      The immediate question was whether or notto open negotiations with the European Economic Community.As the whole question is of major importance for Britain and for decision by her, Australian Ministers did not feel entitled to objectto the opening of negotiations by the British Government should itreach the conclusion that this was desirable, but they made it clearthat the absence of objection should in the circumstances not be in-terpreted as implying approval.      They further stressed that as in anysuch negotiations various Australian export industries would be materially involved, Australia should be in a position to negotiatedirect on Australia&apos;s behalf when details and arrangements affectingitems of Australian trade were being discussed.Mr. Sandys said he well understood the position of the australian government and he appreciated its understanding of Britain&apos;s problem.It was agreed that these talks, which had been conducted in amost helpful and constructive spirit on both sides, had resulted ina more complete understanding of the important;   and complex issues involved,Commonwealth Relations Office,Downing Street, S.W.1.July 11th 1961.
COMMON   MAg&amp;etu.K/CANADA COMMUNIQUE   JULY lhTH 1961.Mr. Duncan Sandys, the British Secretary of State for Com-commonwealth Relations, met yesterday and to-day under the Chairman-ship of Mr. Donald Fleming, Canadian Minister of Finance, withMr. Howard Green, Secretary of State for External Affairs, Mr.George Hees, Minister of Trade and Commerce, and Mr. Alvin Hamil-ton, Minister of Agriculture.

TheBritish Government had as yet reached no decision on this issue.The immediate question was whether or not to open negotiationswith the Community.The Canadian Ministers recognised that this is a matter for decision by the British Government.Mr. Sandys said that if, following the present preliminaryexchanges of views, the British Government should decide to open negotiations, they would then consult fully with theother members of the Commonwealth.The Canadian Ministers  indicated that their Government&apos;sassessment of the situation was different from that put forward by Mr. Sandys.     They expressed the grave concern of the canadian government about the implications of possible negotiations be-tween Britain and the European Economic Community, and about thepolitical and economic effects which British membership in theEuropean Economic Community would have on Canada and on theCommonwealth as a whole.Mr. Sandys said that before the British Government reachedany decision, they would carefully consider the views of theCanadian Government together with those of other commonwealth governments.
