SECRET -      181-(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 133 COPY NO.    Vh1st September, 1961CABINETKUWAITMemorandum by the Minister of DefenceWe are committed to withdrawing our forces from Kuwait assoon as an Arab League force which the Amir regards as adequate is stationedthere.   We do not yet know when this will be, but we must assume that thewithdrawal might have to take place before the end of September.2. None of this will affect our obligation to the Amir under theExchange of Letters of 19th June to come to his assistance if he asks us to doso.   Existing evidence suggests that the Arab League forces and the KuwaitiArmed forces would never draw up a joint plan of operation.   In any case theArab League forces will   at some time retire, possibly before the next hotweather.   We must therefore consider how our forces are to meet this commit-ment in these changed circumstances,....     - :     .....3. The total force which Iraq is capable of bringing to bear againstKuwait is estimated at one infantry division supported by up to 156 tanks anda parachute unit in an infantry role.   Up to four days&apos; warning of the arrival of this force on the frontier might be received, but this canot be counted uponfrom intelligence sources alone.   In view of the cost of deploying the forcesnecessary to meet a surprise attack on a divisional scale, I do not recommendtrying to provide for such a contingency.   However, the current intelligenceassessment is that of the total force, up to an infantry brigade supported bythe parachute unit in the infantry role and 39 tanks could attack Kuwait probablywithout any warning at all.   It may well be that Iraq   would adopt this course in the hope of achieving surprise and thus a quick take-over of Kuwait.4. It is believed that the Arab League force and the Kuwaiti forces could hold the airfield and other points of entry against such an attack for notmore than 36 hours.   The situation facing uo io thus more difficult than thatwhich existed before the present operations, in tha&apos;t:-(a) We have to be prepared to intervene within 36 hours as opposedto four days.(b) We are unlikely to get any warning of the need for interventionuntil after Iraqi aggression has actually been launched.In the light of this advice, and after consultation with the Foreign Secretary, I asked the Chiefs of Staff to prepare a plan on the assumption that our inter-vention within 36 hours would be necessary,-1-
5. The full land force redeployment proposed by the Chiefs of staff is given in Annex A to this paper.   Given a four day warning period, this couldbe enough to defend Kuwait against the maximum threat Iraq could pose.   Ofthe total force, the brigade headquarters, with two battalion groups, personnel to man tanks, armoured cars and artillery, and air support, could be intrOfduced into Kuwait within 36 hours.6. This smaller force would be capable of taking over the defenceof the points of entry and holding them against an attack in brigade strengthuntil the total force was assembled some 60 hours later.   Such a redeploymentwill involve stationing more troops in Bahrein/Sharj ah than were there beforethe Kuwaiti operation, keeping some of them at a higher state of readiness,and employing more armour and artillery.   The increased numbers will requireadditional accommodation, which in the early days, at least, would have to betents.   If the commitment is to be a long-term one and certainly before thenext hot season, better accommodation would be required.   It is estimatedthat the cheapest air-conditioned accommodation would cost some  500,000.Unless approval for the building is given this month it will not be ready intime.   A very early approach to the Ruler of Bahrein will be necessary toask himtD provide the necessary land.   The high state of readiness is less objectionable in a station such as Bahrein than it would be elsewhere; itnevertheless means more frequent rotation, and hence additional cost.   Oneof the reasons why this increased state of readiness is required is that wecannot count on a long-term basis on the very favourable continuation of circumstances, including use of H. M.S. Bulwark, that enabled us to interveneswiftly in July.7. An essential part of the plan would be the prepositioning in kuwait itself of 24 tanks, 24 armoured cars, 12 field guns, and certain other equipment and ammunition.   The Amir of Kuwait has been asked to accept this into Kuwait and to pay for it, and has agreed to do so.   He has also acceptethe necessary British personnel for its maintenance on the understanding thattheir numbers are kept to a minimum.8. The period for which the points of entry to Kuwait could be heldagainst an Iraqi attack might be expected to increase as the build-up of theKuwaiti forces proceeded.   We have offered the Amir a training mission tohelp this process forward, but he has refused to accept a mission of the sizewe think is necerssary.   This is likely to delay matters and we are considering whether the Amir can be offered a smaller team which would go some way towards meeting our desires and be acceptable to him.   There have been recentsigns that something of the kind may be possible.9. As far as the Royal Air Force (R.A.F.) is concerned, it willfirstly be necessary to have an effective radar system sited at Kuwait, and ready for immediate use.   Until such time as permanent surveillance equipment is installed by the Amir, it will be necessary for us to deploy a mobile radarfor this purpose.   Arrangements have already been made to have this equipment in situ in September, and the Amir has now agreed.   This would allow the three air defence frigates, which have been withdrawn from otherstations and which are taking turns to provide radar cover, to be released.-2-
10. The full air force deployment required to effect re-entry of our forces within thejproposed time-scale is given at Annex B.   This deployment    1will involve the provision of air-conditioned accommodation at Bahrein whichwill be additional to that proposed for the Army in paragraph 6 and will costa further  100, 000.   The need to hold elements of the strategic and tacticaltransport forces at the proposed degree of readiness, either earmarked forthe theatre or deployed in it, will affect the R. A. F. &apos;s ability to carry ou other air transport tasks and operations, and will prove particularly in- 1hibiting in the Middle East theatre itself, where the Commander-in-Chief willrequire to maintain the bulk of his tactical transport force well forward andat a high state of readiness.   However, the air deployment plan can be re-con sidered from time to time in the light of the situation in Iraq and other commitments.   It is the most flexible element in our planning.11. The measures I have described are not cheap and may have tobe maintained for a long time.   The Chiefs of Staff have considered in particularwhether there are factors not already taken into account which would point theway to economies.   They have considered whether the political deterrent effectof the Arab League force in Kuwait so reduced the likelihood that Iraq willattack Kuwait that we could afford to take less elaborate precautions.   the modifications they have consideredare a reduction in the quantity ofprepositioned equipment, a slight reduction of the number of troops deployedin the Arabian Peninsula itself, and lower state of readiness.12. The have reached the conclusion that, at least for the present,while the likelihood of an Iraqi attack on Kuwait may be reduced by thepresence of the Arab League force, the military risk remains, particularly of a surprise attack by a Brigade Group;  and that nothin g le ss than their earlier proposals will do if the United Kingdom is to retain the capacity tore-intervene on an appropriate scale within 36 hours, and to build up to thetotal force requirement within four days.   A partial thinning out of the forwarddeployment would mean that an initial balanced force could not be assembledin Kuwait for about 48 hours.   Infantry would be left there without fieldartillery support for up to 24 hours and air support could not make good the deficiency.   A reduction in the prepositioned equipment would necessitate the employment of sea transport so that the initial force could not be properlyequipped until the fourth or fifth day.13, The implications are two-fold.   The hazards to the troops would be grater and the operation itself would be likely to be changedin character from one of virtually unopposed re-entry into Kuwait to oneof eviction of Iraqi forces that had forestalled us.14. While Iraq maintains the full vigour of her claims on Kuwait,I do not see how we can do less than this if we are to have a real capacity to implement our obligation to the Amir.   Obviously, this is a situation that must be kept under careful review but, for the immediate future atleast, I ask my colleagues to endorse these proposals, provided that the amir will play his part.H.
