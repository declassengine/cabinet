(61) 106 COPY NO.^20&apos;;h July, 1961CABINETPUBLIC INVESTMENT,  1962/63Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate herewith the annual Treasury report on public investment.   This has been prepared in consultation with theDepartments primarily concerned, but does not commit them in anyway.S. L.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.18th July, 1961
mCIVIL PUBLIC INVESTMENT;    1S61/62 AND 1962/63REPORT BY THE TREASURY TO THE CHANCELLOR OF THE exchequer in recent years, decisions have teen taken by ministers in July or the early autumn of each year on the level of public investment in the following year, with provisional decisions about public investment in the year after that. (The longerthese decisions are delayed after July, the less effective theyare likely to bef    in many cases, if the orderly execution ofthe programmes is not to be prejudiced, action will have to betaken on a provisional basis in advance of the actual decisions).This year, the annual Investment Review has been brought into amuch closer relationship with public expenditure generally. Itis an integral part of the five-year review of expenditure inrelation to prospective resources prepared by the Treasury withthe help of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee,    Moreover,the report of the Plowden Committee and the decision to publishan annual White Paper on Public Investment (the first was issued in November 1$60, Cmnd.1203) have caused us to considermore closely the methods by which public investment is carriedout and controlled.   A statement on purposes and methods ofcontrol, prepared by the Treasury and accepted by theDepartments, is at Appendix A.2. The main purposes of this paper are:-(a) to appraise the actual progress of public invest-ment in 1961/62 in the light of Ministers&apos; decisionslast year;(b) to propose to Ministers the levels of investment expenditure for each item for the year 1962/63, onwhich Departments&apos; action should now be based.3. For this purpose it is helpful to consider the threeyears 196C/61 to 1962/63 together, since present performance/has
has a close hearing upon the realism of proposals and decisionsfor 1962/63.    Figures for these three years are thereforeshown in the Tables at Appendix B.4. On past practice, the review should also proposeprovisional levels for 1963/64 and have an advance look at public investment up to 1965/66.   But, this year, this cannot yet he done.    The work of the Public Expenditure survey committee has called attention to the close link &quot;between thelevel of public investment and the expanding tendency of public expenditure generally.   The investment programmes are the coreof the expansion and improvement of most of the public services;and if this rate of expansion is to be restrained, it will certainly require reduction of capital expenditure.    According-ly, decisions on the public investment programmes beyond1962/63 must await Ministers&apos; decisions on the permissiblegrowth of current expenditure;   but to maintain programmes onan orderly and economical basis, it will be necessary to reachearly decisions on l?63/64.Ministers&apos; Decisions on the I960 Review5. The I960 Review was presented to Ministers in July I960(C.(60)112).   Ministers then agreed a total for investment expenditure for 1961/62 (C.C(60) 43rd Conclusions); and inOctober they approved figures for the individual programmes(C.C.(60) 52nd Conclusions).   These were published in november in the White Paper on Public Investment, which was the subjectof a Debate in the House of Commons on 9th and 10th November,I960.6. .        Ministers agreed in December (C.C.(60) 62nd Conclusions)to provisional figures for investment expenditure for 1962/63,deciding &quot;minima&quot; beyond which Departments should not makecommitments pending decisions on the 1961 Review, and &quot;margins&quot;above this for which Departments could make plans but not/enterCOMFiDEWTSAL
enter into commitments.7. Since last year the definition of public investment for the purposes of the Investment Review has been altered in several ways.36   In the remainder of this paper correspondingadjustments have been made to all figures relating to pastexpenditure in order te facilitate comparison between them andthe proposals now under consideration.    This means that thefigures in the following paragraphs are not the same as those used in the White Paper.8. The following table summarises the picture revealed bythe I960 Review, and the decisions taken by Ministerss-  millionYear I960 Review TotalActual outturnActualpricesi 19 57/58!l958/59! 19 59/60Estimated outturn1470147016104March1960prices!l962/63J1960/61        Departments&apos; estimates 1695\1961/62        Approved total 1720(departments  proposals 1800(Approved minima 1745Outturn for 1960/619. Throughout 1960/61 evidence was accumulating that therewould be a significant shortfall on the forecast outturn shown/inThe main changes have been the exclusion of all defenceinvestment (so that the Review is now concerned solely with civil public investment) and the inclusion of certain port and harbour authorities which had previously been left outof account.   In addition there have been some changes inthe definition of expenditure charged to capital account bythe National Coal Board and the General Post Office, and thisaffects their investment figures.4Subsequently amended to  1635 million.
min the table.    The sum of Departments&apos;  estimates envisaged that expenditure on public investment in 1960/61 would amountto  1695 million at March I960 prices - a rise of  85 million on the estimated outturn of the previous year at actual prices.We now put the actual outturn at  1635 million - the same in money terms as the total of the previous year.    One factorcontributing to this shortfall seems to have been the load onthe building and civil engineering industries in England andWales, which has prevented work (especially in the public sector) from proceeding as quickly as had been expected.Performance in 1961/621G.     For 1961/62, Departments&apos; estimates total  1755 million at March 1961 prices (their original returns were much higher).This is very considerably above the 1960/61 outturn of 1635 million (at prices current in 1960/61).    It is alsohigher than the  1720 million (at March I960 prices) approved for 1961/62 by Ministers last year; &quot;but allowing for theincrease in prices between March I960 and March 1961 it represents in volume a total somewhat below that approved lastyear.11.       The effects of price increases do not show themselvesuniformly through the 1961 returns.    Some Departments have allowed small increases of 1-3 per cent, from March i960 to march 1961 (i.e., about the average price rise in the period);others reported that many tenders received in the first quarterof 1961 were IQfo or more higher than those of a year earlier.This is partly because, for the larger projects at least,tenders were already taking account of the wage increase dueto come into effect in the building and civil engineering industries in October 1961.12.      Although the aggregate is very likely to be lower in volume in the remainder of 1961/62 than the basis of the total/approved
approved &quot;by Ministers last year, there are some programmes which are running ahead of what was then estimated, and somerunning behind.    Some of the nationalised industries (notablyelectricity and the G.P.O.) have felt the need for expandedprogrammes to meet the increased levels of demand experiencedover the last two years.    In some of the social servide pro-grammes the pressures towards expansion have been proving so strong (especially in the case of items which had been severelyheld down in the past) that Departments have found difficultyin keeping within the limits previously authorised.13.     The expenditure for 1961/62 is virtually entirelycommitted by Departments (either in their own contracts or inauthorisations given to local authorities, nationalised industries, etc.) and is only to a very limited extentsusceptible of being affected by Ministerial action.Investment Expenditure in 1962/6314.     Urgent action is needed if Ministers&apos; decisions are tomake an impact on investment expenditure in 1962/63.    Thefollowing considerations are relevants-(a) The general pressure of demand in the economy is so high, and is likely to remain so.(b) The load on the building and civil engineering industries in England and Wales remains very heavy andappears to be increasing faster than capacity.    TheMinistry of Works suggests that this year (1961/62) maysee an increase in output of new construction work of something like 8fo over last year, accounted for by anincrease of 4$ in the labour force and 4$ in output perman.    But it is thought doubtful whether the increase inthe labour force can be maintained, and the heavy load on industry, combined with a shortage of skilled men, islikely to have an adverse effect on output per man./This
This means, in the Ministry&apos;s view, that overalloutput might not increase by more than about 3ft &quot;between1961/62 and 1962/63.In addition, two other factors relevant to 1961/62 are likelyto become even more important in 1962/63&apos;-(c) Besides the general increase in prices and the prospective effect of the forthcoming increase in wages in the building industry, the disproportionate rise inthe price of land is making itself felt on thoseprogrammes with a large land element in them.(d) The Government have this year published the white paper on the Financial and Economic Obligations of the nationalised Industries (Cmnd.1337), clarifying thefinancial responsibilities of those industries in orderto establish a firmer foundation for their future operations.15.      In the light of these considerations, the Treasury&apos;approach to the problems of the appropriate level of expenditureon public investment for 1962/63 has been based on the follow-ing criterias-(a) For the nationalised industries, the main factorshould be their ability to meet the financial targetsto be set in accordance with the policy laid down in theWhite Paper.    Their investment should not be limited ina way which is incompatible with this policy or would endanger the provision of essential supplies and services.    (But see paragraph 19).(b) For the other programmes, investment expenditure should in general be held at the minima approved by ministers in I960, with an addition of 3fa to compensate for price increases between March I960 and March 1961 andsubject to further adjustments where justified by the/special
special circumstances of a particular case,(c) For those programmes which contain a large elementfor the purchase of land, some special recognition, in fixing a figure,  should he paid to the fact that theprice of land has risen very considerably and thatrather different considerations apply in the purchase ofland as compared with other forms of investment; but,subject to this, criteria (a) and (b) should apply tothese programmes.    On the one hand, if the departments and authorities cut back drastically their purchases ofland, this could have a harmful effect on future planning;on the other hand, if they proceed with their plannedpurchases, they may only feed the inflation of landvalues and bid up the price against themselves.    on balance, some curtailment seems necessary.16.     Our examination of the investment programmes suggeststhat these principles could be carried out within an aggregate of about  1865 million at the prices ruling in the 1961investment returns.    This is about  110 million higher than theestimate for 1961/62, but, on the other hand, it is  100 million less than the total of the Departments&apos; original proposals forthe year IS62/63.    The total of about  I865 million would stillimply strong pressure on the construction industry, and doubtshave been expressed by the Ministry of Works about theindustry&apos;s ability to cope with it.   But to plan for lowerpublic investment expenditure in 1962/63 would certainly involveeither damage to the financial performance of the nationalised industries (and an increase in their demands on the Exchequer)or a widespread cancellation of committals by Departments tolocal authorities,  etc.  (or both).17.     If the economic situation makes it necessary to confinepublic investment to a significantly lower figure, this would/require
require immediate and large changes of long-term policy, anda complete reprogramming accordingly.Departmental Estimates for 1962/6318.     The tables at Appendix B show the out turns for 1959/60and 1960/61 and the forecasts for 1961/62; for 1962/63 theyshow three sets of figures: the &quot;minima&quot; determined by ministers last year, the &quot;minima&quot; adjusted for a 3 per cent,price increase, and the figures to which Departments should work if the basis of paragraph 16 is acceptable.    The conse-quences of these proposals for 1962/63 are discussed in thefollowing paragraphs which deal most fully with those items,such as the nationalised industries and the small services,which raise the most important issues.19*       Fuel and Power industries.    These estimates, drawn upaccording to the principle in paragraph 15, provide for higherexpenditure than was contemplated last year.    For coal, some increase has been allowed on account of expenditure deferredfrom earlier years and some additional provision for smokelessfuel plants.    For gas, and even more for electricity, the increases are largely due to provision to meet a higher fore-cast demand and to improve efficiency.    When these figures aregiven to the industries, the latter should be asked to postponeexpenditure wherever this can be done without significantdamage to the attainment of their financial targets or danger to the provision of essential supplies and services.20.       Air Corporations.    The increased expenditure in 1962/63is made necessary by purchases of aircraft to provide thenumbers and types necessary to secure the traffic now expected.21.     Atomic Energy Authority.    The proposed figure is areduction on the previous estimate.
22.    Post Office.    The figure assumes some increase on the previously approved, level in respect of productive andprofitable investment, &quot;but no increase in the rate of provisionof telephones in 1961/62 and 1962/63 as compared with 196O/6I.23.     University Grants Committee.    The proposed figure is areduction on the previous estimate.24*     Education.    The proposed figures will entail reductions on minor works in England and Wales, and some reduction ofwork in Scotland.25.     Housing; (including houses in New Towns).    The estimateprovides for starts of 109,200 in England and Wales, butassumes a slower rate of completions in line with presenttrends.    Eor Scotland the estimate assumes that tenders willcontinue to come in for approval at the present rate;    to achieve a lower figure would require a system of allocations.26.     Water and Sewerage.    The estimate assumes some delay inapprovals of new schemes.27.     Local Health and Welfare.    The proposed figure for england and Wales assumes local authority delays in thepreparation of new schemes.28.       Hospitals.    The proposed figure for England and Walesassumes some delay in planning new schemes.29.     British Transport Commission.    The figure for therailways reflects the fact that the right pattern of futurenew investment in the railways is still being worked out. Forother activities, the increase is mainly due to increasedinvestment by London Transport.
30.       Roads.    The figures assume acceptance of the LowerAlternative programme put forward in the Report of the working group to the Road Programme Committee.31.       Central Governments    Small Services.    In consideringprevious Reviews, Ministers have treated these services as asingle unit.    The adjusted total approved for them in 1966 was 52.1 million, but the aggregate of Departments&apos; bids exceedsthis by nearly 10$.    In part this increase is the result ofcertain additional expenditure approved since last year (e,g.,the decision to purchase the Bridge Street site for Governmentdevelopment at a cost of about  1.5 million).    In additionDepartments have   had less experience in controlling these services than the large investment programmes, and it is clearthat, when the time came for some expansion of these servicesafter a period of severe restraint, they found difficulty in achieving a phased and orderly development.    Because of these considerations it is not practicable to keep the total down to last year&apos;s adjusted total.    We believe, however,  that, thanks to reductions in some of these items and re-phasing ofexpenditure in others, it should be possible to keep these services within an aggregate of  54.2 million.    To aim at anylower figure would run the risk of causing great disturbancein these services.32.       Local Authorities;    Small Services.    These have also inthe past been treated by Ministers as a single unit. Parts ofthis expenditure (i.e., that financed out of revenue or by borrowing under a local Act) is not susceptible to Departmentalcontrolf and even where the Department can exercise somecontrol,  e.g., through loan sanctions, it is at one remove fromthe actual execution of the work.    The total of the estimatesput in for these items, at  163 million, far exceeded theadjusted total of  123 million approved last year.    This is/partly
partly due to certain statistical adjustments to last year&apos;s figures, partly to a number of unavoidable new commitments(e.g., increased expenditure under the Slaughterhouses Act,1958, and provision for a fourth New Town in Scotland); but theincrease results largely from the absence of any long-term planning over most of this field.    It does hot appearpracticable to limit expenditure on these services to 123 million; but, as part of an announced policy which madethe Government *s aim clear to local authorities, the totalcould, we believe, be contained within a maximum of  14$ million- though this would require a very marked change of directionin certain fields (notably Local Government &quot;general&quot; services)as well as delay in the processes of authorisation in others.Given continued pressure, it might even be possible to find some further small reductions;    but it seems more important to concentrate on bringing some greater degree of order to thisblock of expenditure in order to facilitate control in future.
APPENDIX APurposes and methods of investment control.     There are three aspects of control &quot;by the departments and by the Treasury:-.(a) Management - to ensure that the programmes conform with Government policy generally;    are properly balancedand well worked out;    are economically sound;    providegood value for money;    and are efficiently directed andprogressed.(b) Resources - to keep aggregate long-term public investment programmes within the prospective limitsset by economic resources.(c) &quot;Flexibility&quot; - to provide for the possible needfor limited short-term adjustments, upwards or dovmwards,in accordance with the economic situation.2.      The field which is covered by the control is fixed investment (as distinct from, e.g., working capital) of theGovernment, local authorities, and nationalised industries and other public corporations, however financed.   We exclude the investment of Defence Departments;    this is separatelycontrolled, in the main (barracks, airfields, R.O.F.s, etc.)as part of the defence budget.3.      It is convenient to express investment as one aggregate,but there is great variety between the forms of the programmes and the criteria which should govern them, and the methods by which they are administered.    Some are wholly financed from Votes and are the direct responsibility of the department concerned (e.g., motor-ways);    others,  though wholly Vote-financed, are carried out by non-departrnental bodies (e.g. ,universities or Regional Hospital Boards).A.
h.     Local authority programmes are in general financed &quot;bylocal authority borrowing.    In some cases the service of thecapital is subsidised by special Exchequer grants (e.g.,housing);    in others (e.g., education), it is subsidisedindirectly through the general grant;    and in others it isborne entirely by the local authority.    The building programmes are administered by the local authorities under varying degrees of supervision from the responsible Department.Then there are the nationalised industries&apos; programmes, whichare financed in whole or in part by Exchequer loans, ingreatly differing financial and commercial circumstances.5.      These programmes share the essential characteristic ofpublic (as distinct from private) investment, that the investment decisions involve considerations of public interest,and do not depend simply upon the investment&apos;s ability to attract finance by its profitability.    This is a fundamentalreason for control - the financial criteria which determine whether or not private investment shall take place do notapply with the same force (and often do not apply at all) inthe case of public investment.6.     Within the total of public investment there istremendous diversity - at the one end those nationalised industries which are earning an adequate return on their capital;    through those which are not, and other undertakingson a quasi-commercial basis;    to those kinds of investment in which decisions are taken according to social needs.    Itis likely that these differences will widen as the Government&apos;snationalised industries&apos; policy comes into effect, and in due course those types of public investment which are able to pay their way financially may well have to be considered separately from the others.C G Ml F 3 D S M T 3 A L
7.      It follows that the methods which the Government employsto influence the various kinds of public investment mustdiffer greatly.    Thus, within the ambit of local authorities&apos;investment, the Government controls by loan sanction, and insome cases by specific authorisation for new projects.    Overnationalised industries (when solvent), on the other hand, theGovernment has no control over individual investment projects,and is concerned largely with long-term programmes andaggregate expenditure.8.      Thus it would be wrong to pretend that the whole ofpublic investment is homogeneous, and that standardised,formula can be applied all round. Departments need, however,to be assured that all other Departments&apos; programmes arebeing handled comparably with their own, i.e., by referenceto the considerations listed in paragraph 1 above.    Providedthat every programme satisfies 1(a) above;    that theaggregate satisfies 1(b);    and that within each Department&apos;ssphere there is proper scope for short-term variation under1(c);    then the task is being carried out well,Long-Term programmes9.      In order to carry out the control of expendituregenerally and of the capital component within it, as envisaged by the Public Expenditure Survey, it will benecessary for each Department to formulate some kind ofTr-ng-term programme or appreciation either of its owninvestment or that of the local authorities or nationalised industries under its surveillance.    Many Departments havebeen doing this for several years and their experience suggests that this procedure might be adopted more widely.The Treasury will in principle be ready to approve suchprogrammes, provided they satisfy the criteria in paragraph 1./in
In some instances, however, it may not &quot;be practicable to draw-up a &quot;long-term programme&quot; in the full sense since the work is too miscellaneous or the control too far removed fromexecution to make this really sensible;   but in such cases it is proposed that Departments should regularly prepare an appreciation of the prospects for future investment.10.   A clear distinction can be made between a &quot;long-term programme&quot;,    which represents the objective to which theDepartment and its associated authorities are working andpreparing building plans and the like, and the rate at which such a &quot;programme&quot; is implemented.    The &quot;programme&quot; may be expressed in many different ways - sometimes a clearcut,physical objective, e.g., say, the provision of 2h,000additional places at teacher training colleges, and sometimesin money terms.   Whichever way it is expressed, it should always represent a clear and definite plan of work spreadover a period of years.    It need not necessarily be a fixedprogramme for a precise period;    it may consist of firm and detailed plans for the near future with rather less firm proposals for later years, the whole being rolled forward ayear at a time.    But it should in each case represent a clear and coherent task to which the Department and its associatedauthorities are devoting themselves.Control and Implementation11.    The rate of implementation of a &quot;programme&quot; is determined by the particular departmental action which setsinvestment in motion, either by way of contracts by theDepartment itself or by way of authorisations by a Departmentto local authorities or nationalised industries.    The methodof implementation differs very widely;    it may beauthorisation of &quot;starts&quot; to the local authorities;    or thegrant of loan sanctions;    or the promise of loan sanctions infuture years;    or approval of prospective figures for/investment
investment expenditure, e,g,, by a nationalised industry;    or,in respect of the Department&apos;s own business, a specificannouncement of something it proposes to do;    or again it maybe the placing of contracts.   All this wide variety of methodsof controlling implementation we define under the general title of &quot;committal&quot;.    This is the point at which central control should in principle be exercised for, once a &quot;committal&quot; hasbeen made, the Department is unable to turn back without greatdifficulty.    Moreover, once work has actually started on a project, it is generally right and economical to let it go forward to completion as quickly as possible.Investment Expenditure12.    Prom a controlling Department&apos;s point of view,treasury approval is sought and given in terms of &quot;committals&quot; as they come forward.    It is essential, however,  that the relationship between the rate of implementation implied in the &quot;committals&quot;and the total investment expenditure dealt with in the annual review should be clearly understood in each case.    The annualInvestment Review is necessarily expressed in terms of investment expenditure (value of work done) in specifiedperiods, for only in this way can public investment expenditurebe rationally considered in relation to other claims uponeconomic resources.    When the Treasury approves a &quot;committal&quot;this must be on an understanding of the consequences in termsof investment expenditure.13.    It is necessary, therefore, for the progress of investment to be examined carefully by Departments and theTreasury, quarter by quarter, in order to follow what is happening and to see how approved &quot;committals&quot; are in factbeing translated into investment expenditure.    The essence ofthe matter is that for each programme a divergence between theactual performance and that implied in the approved level of&quot;committals&quot; should be spotted in good time so that theappropriate corrective action can be taken./Conclusions
Conclusionslk.    The considerations set out above are the basis for thejoint control of public investment by the Departments and theTreasury.    The timetable of the various operations and presentation for Ministerial decision will be considered aspart of the review of procedure in long-term control of public expenditure generally.C.1011-61
