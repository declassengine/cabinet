SECRET?HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT)27th July, 1961COPY NO.CABINETBERLINMemorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign AffairsMy colleagues will shortly be considering various aspectsof the Berlin problem.   This has become desirable and possiblenow that President Kennedy has completed his review of his ownpolicy on the subject.   As a result a memorandum setting out theviews of the United States Government was handed to H. M. Ambassadorin Washington on 22nd July.2. I circulate the text of this memorandum and its firstattachment (dealing with the military programme proposed by theUnited States Government), the other two attachments not beingimmediately relevant to our discussion.H.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.26th July, 1961SECRET
SECRETMEMORANDUM ON MEASURES FORDEALING WITH THE BERLIN SITUATION1. The United States Government has given urgent andintensive consideration to the manner in which the Soviet threat0 to the Western position in Berlin should be met.    In this process,searching analysis has been undertaken of Soviet objectives andtactics, and of the resources, and the alternative means ofemploying them, available to the Western Alliance for dealing withthe situation they present.    The United States has now reachedcertain conclusions as to the.oourees of action which it believesshould be followed.   This memorandum is intended to describebriefly these conclusions and in so doing to serve as a basis forinitial consul tatioi s among the four Western Powers on the subject.2. The Soviet threat to the Western position in Berlin hasexisted in the same general form since 1958.   The United Statesbelieves, however, that the West must assume for purposes ofarriving at its own policy that the USSR is in earnest in itsstated intention to sign a separate peace treaty this year withEast Germany which will, in the Soviet view, bring to an endAllied rights in Berlin.3. The United States believes that in addition to theobjectives in Central Europe which have led the USSR to pursuethis course of action, a key factor in Soviet policy formulationis the belief that, in the end, the West will not fight to defendits positio&amp;i in Berlin.i+.   In the view of the United States, therefore. Westernpolicy should consist of two principal elements: 1) a cl ardemonstration of Western determination to defend the Alliedposition in Berlin, at the risk of war if necessary; and 2) anactive diplomatic program, including negotiations with the SovietUnion, designed to provide the Soviet leadership an alternativecourse of action which does not endanger vital Western interestsin Berlin. Wm5. With respect of the first element, which might becharacterized as the establishment of a more effective deterrentand capability for military action, the United States proposesto begin immediately a series of measures to increase its armedstrength.   These steps will be taken with due regard to thedangers of a spreading arms race.   We continue to stand readyto negotiate on the reduction and control of armaments. However,at this time, the greatest danger to peace is the failure totake the measures outlined in this memorandum.6. The United States, for these reasons, proposes to take asits first steps measures which will initiate a long-run build-upof military strength and which will not be of such a dramatic andemergency nature as to exacerbate the crisis.    It intends, morespecifically, to undertakesa.   A request to the Congress, to &quot;! e nade cn Wednesday,, July 26, for a supplementary defense budget of three and twotenths billion dollars to add to the approximately three billion.liar supplementary request already made.   This w#uld providethe United States with progressively stronger forces in themonths ahead, giving it a capability of moving and additional six/ divisions toSECRET
SECRETdivisions to Europe at the end of the year or at any timethereafter if our allied decision is that the situation warrantsthis.    The United States would also have available supplementaryunits of tactical and transport aircraft and increased navalstrength especially in the fi ld of anti-submarine warfare.Further, the United States is acting to increase immediately by ?. fifty per cent the number of its bomber aircraft on ground alertstatus.   Attached to this memorandum is a paper setting forththis program in more detail, together with our thoughts on NATO-wide measures in this field.b.   Substantial measures in the field of civil defense(shelter construction,-recruitment and training of personnel, etc.7o   In addition, the United States believes that the followingprecautionary and planning efforts should be undertaken withinthe next few weeks;a. Strengthen the position of West Berlin to sustain aninterruption of access by reviewing and improving airliftprocedures and the stockpile as necessary;b. Review our Berlin contingency planning in the lightof the present situation;c. Complete Allied plans for use of a wide range of non-military countermeasures, including economic sanctions, uponinterruption of access to Berlin or earlier as a warning anddeterrent.   A paper on the subject of economic sanctions isattached.8. It will be of great importance to obtain the maximumsupport of world public opinion for the Western position and^policies.    The United States has begun, therefore, and proposesTo expand in cooperation with its Allies, an active publicinformation program on a world-wide scale to this end. Apreliminary quadripartite paper based #n propaganda themesSuggested by the British Government has already been agreed, andth^ attached paper is intended as a further step in thedevelopment of such a program.9. The United States regards it as of the utmost importancethat the response to the Soviet threat be a joint undertakingon the part of the NATO Alliance.   The unity of the West in theface of Soviet aggrandizement in Central Europe will in and #fitself be a most powerful factor in deterring the USSR from itspresent course of action.    The United States hopes, therefore,that in all aspects of this endeavor it will be joined by itsAllies.    In the military field particularly the United Statesbelieves that all NATO members should make an effort comparableto that which it is making.    The United States realizes thatcost and sacrifice will be involved, but believes that theAlliance must act vigorously to meet the present challenge. Aclear willingness to bear increased burdens on the part of allour countries will be essential to convey to the Kremlin theneeded impression of allied determination.   We are prepared tojoin our allies urgently in working out a joint military programt^this end.   A joint endeavor of this nature will require the&lt;^Rsest consulation at every step of the way, and suggestionswill be made later in this memorandum for pursuing the initialstages of this consulation./ 10. WithSECRET
SECRET10.   With respect to the second element of Western policy, anactive diplomatic program, the United States foresees severalpossible courses of action.   They shall be the subject of furtherintensive discussion among us, but it might be well at this stageto indicate in general terms what the United States may wish topropose in more detail later:a. It might be well at an early date for us to haveinformal and quiet talks with the Soviet leadership, for examplethrough our Ambassadors in Moscow, to probe the Soviet position,to warn of possible consequences of that position in terms ofAllied military build-up, and to take advantage of anyopportunities which might appear to move towards subsequentunderstanding on an arrangement which might be acceptable.b. Thereafter we might wish to explore opportunities forWestern political initiatives at an appropriate time.   The timingof such initiatives would depend on a number of fetors, among themthe likelihood at any particular time that the Soviet leadershipmay have been sufficiently impressed by the Western deterrentefforts to be willing to settle for solutions acceptable to ua.11. The United States suggests that consulation begin at once,commenaing with the Ambassadorial Steering Group.    This Groupwould presumably wish to consider directives to guide the activityof Allied working groups in Washington on general aspects of thequestion, non-military countermeasures and psychological andpropaganda problems; the quadripartite group on economic counter-measures; and the Live Oak group.12. Following the initial consulations of the Steering Group,the United States proposes consultations at a senior officiallevel to take place in Paris for a week beginning July 28. Thissession would have the purpose of surveying and coordinating sofar as possible the entire range of military, political, economicand psychological measures.13#   There *tmlcC ithen follow meetirngs of the Wostern^ForeignI ,Kiuioter6 in Paris to review the etc/to of preparations,&apos;settleOutstanding problems and ioouc directives for&apos;further work*1U.   After the Foreign Ministers meeting, it is proposed thatone&apos;br all of the Foreign Ministers make an interim report t*NATO and seek other member countries&apos; views on the state ofpreparations.15    If necessary, the senior level group could presumablyremain for a few days in Paris to carry out the instructions of ^the Foreign Minieters.Attachments:1 .

SECRETTHE MILITARY PROGRAMThe U.S. intends to increase promtly the military strengthwhich could be applied in event of blocked access to Berlin.The purpose is twofold: to deter Khrushchev from pressing aBerlin crisis to the point of conflict, and to become betterable to deal with a conflict i&apos;* it nevertheless occurs. Weexpect that the Allies will wish to make correspondingincreases in their own strength, so that our united efforts canhave fullest effect.    The benefits we expect from developingthis added power are described below, followed by statements ofthe U.S. program and suggested comparable Allied programs.SECRET
SECRETA.    Improved Position Anticipated from U.S. and Allied MilitaryBuild-UpWhat deterrent and related   political effects and whatopportunities for action not available from present strengths canbe anticipated as a consequence of a prompt though orderly build-up of the Alliance&apos;s military power?The only military action which present deployed strengths makepossible is a gradual series of probes culminating in a reinforcedbattalion-sized effort which, if thrown back, would require useither to accept humiliation or to initiate nuclear action. Inthe meantime the NATO front remains vulnerable to sudden pene-tration by Soviet, forces such as might present us with a faitaccompli.The proposed U.S. and Allied build-up would have importantdeterrent effects upon the Soviet Union and would contributesubstantially to the securitjr of the North Atlantic area.Although our common efforts have actually produced a substantialdegree of all forms of military strength, there are many among uswho do not recognize the degree of strength these efforts havealready brought.    Through an uncritical acceptance of reportedSoviet division and aircraft numbers and a keen awareness ofNATO&apos;s own military deficiences, it is easy to mislead oneselfinto attributing to the Soviet Union a capability rapidly to-overwhelm NATO in non-nuclear action regardless of what we may do.This leads to the false conclusion that the only effectivemilitary action available to NATO is immediate nuclear action andthat there is little or nothing that can be done to improve ourposition.The proposed program of U.S. and allied build-up would openwider options for NATO military action, and would thereby create abasis for a reversal of the misconceptions about NATO weakness andfor a substantial increase in the credibility of Western capacityto take actions which would render the situation uncontrollableby the Soviet Union and, therefore, dangerous to its basicinterests.Carried to completion, the U.S. and allied program would makepossible the deployment along the crucial central front of 1+0 allieddivisions - about one and a half million men - including asubstantial force in strategic reserve, prior to the sending of aprobe along the autobahn.   These divisions would be supportedby substantial allied air power and by nuclear power generallysiiperior to that of the Soviet Union.   Even if the Soviet Unionwere to mobilize and deploy the maximum number of divisions whichit is believed the terrain and Soviet logistics could support onthe central front, 50 to 55 Soviet divisions (1,500,000 men), theSoviet Union would not have the margins necessary for assurance ofrapid offensive success with non-nuclear weapons.Prom such a posture a large number of options are opened tothe West.   A probe launched from such a position carriesconviction of serious intent.    If the Soviets were to throw itback, they could-not be certain of our response.   We mightinitiate expanded ground action with the assurance that alliedforces could not quickly be driven back.    They must consider thepossibility that we would take the initiative in striking withsurprise all East German a iffields, or even air and missileinstallations in a deeper area.   Another option open to us would/ be toSECRET
SECRET^be to exploit our naval superiority in sea action in appropriateareas.   They must further reckon with the various alternatives ofnuclear attack which would be open to us, including an attackagainst Soviet air bases and missile installations in the USSR.The significant point, however, is that the West would have theoption of initiating large scale ground action which the Sovietscould not throw back rapidly with conventional means.    They couldhardly believe that they could overwhelm NATO forces in largescale and continued ground action without certain escalation tonuclear war.The most important results of a U.S. and allied build-up are,however, to be sought in the phase prior to a ground probe. Inview of the fact that military actions aften an initial groundprobe could tend, as the forces engaged became more numerous andvaried, to pass beyond the positive control of either side shortof ultimate escalation into general nuclear war, a ground probeshould be delayed until all other reasonable alternative courses, have failed.    These other courses will not in themselvesnecessarily be conelusive and a number of them cannot beindefinitely sustained.    It therefore makes a great deal ofdifference to their probable effectiveness whether they are under-taken against a background of continued non-nuclear militaryweakness or against a background of growing military strength.Economic counter-measures gain added weight when they presagemilitary action should they, in themselves, not accomplish thedesired results.An airlift becomes more meaningful and enemy counter-measuresless likely against a background of increasing military strength.Furthermore, the contemplated build-up would give us substantiallyincreased fighter cover for such an airlift and an increasedbomber atack threat against counter-measures.Naval harassment and even naval blockading actions are morelikely to be suffered v/ithout major retaliation in a situation ofgrowing power than against a background of unchanged strength.In view of the stockpiled supplies in Berlin, there may be timeto consider what military response should be made to harassment, orblockade of the access routes, and to complete any needed build-up.This element of time will allow us to relate any decision aboutthe actual deployment of U.S. divisions to Europe to the develop-ment of the crisis.    In the meantime there would be a continuousimprogement in the training, filling up, and equipping of the&apos;NATO forces in being, an improvement in their deployment and intheir air support.   All such U.S. and allied :ac&apos;tions would ?&apos; 1contribute to a long-run improvement of allied forces as well asto increased readiness for the current crisis.wSECRET
SECRETB.    The U.S. Military ProgramThe United States Government plans, subject to approval bythe Congress of necessary increases in the Defense budget, toundertake immediately a program designed to improve and augmentthe forces we can contribute to common defense of the NATO area,and specifically to any military actions which the Alliance mayfind necessary in connection with a possible Berlin crisis.The purpose of this military program will be twofold: First,to give clear evidence of our determination, and of the fact thatwe will conduct any negotiations, political, or economic actionsagainst a background of strength, in order to persuade the SovietUnion that its present course is not only dangerous but alsofruitless.    Second, to increase the range of militaryalternatives available to the Alliance should the Soviet leadersnevertheless precipitate a crisis, in order to allow time forthem to correct the miscalculation which led to the crisis anddivert the course of events away from nuclear war in a mannerwhich preserves our interests.The kinds of actions contemplated in this program include:- Bringing the active units of our military establishment tohigher manpower and readiness levels, prepared for early deployment- Increasing air and sea lift capabilities.- Accelerating production of non-nuclear equipment, ammunitionand stocks.- Providing for rapid deployment of additional ground andair units to Europe.- Making stand-by provision for calling up selected ground,tactical air, and naval reserve units whenever the developingsituation indicates that such action is advisable- Increasing nuclear delivery and other general warreadiness levels.Details concerning major actions contemplated in the programare indicated in Section C.To.finance the program, the Congress will be asked toauthorize about  3*3 billion now, with additional expendituresto be authorized if and when additional mobilization is indicated.Of the funds involved, in excess of $1.75 billion will bedevoted to procurement, and the remainder to additional personneland operating costs.This program will give us the capability, by the end of thiscalendar year, to deploy six additional division forces and up tothirty additional tactical air squadrons to Europe.   This representa deployment in excess of our planned contributions to NATOthrough M / 30 of a general war.   These forces would not actuallybe deployed unless and until the situation, agreed plans, andcorresponding programs on the part of our European allieswarranted such action.   Nevertheless, their very readiness andavailability should exert considerable influence on the situationlong before actual deployment became a considsration./   In addition,SECRET
SECRETIn addition, our program will provide for such vital collateralmilitary capabilities as:- Increased readiness of our long-range nuclear strikecapability, including an accelerated alert status in ourStrategic Air Command.- Greatly improved capabilities to conduct anti-submarinewarfare and other necessary naval operations.- Retention of the capability to cope with possible acts oflimited aggression outside the European area, and a strengthenedgeneral war posture.The United States Government considers that this program,particularly if associated with corresponding programs on thepart of our allies, will substantially enhance the cKdibility ofour policy, which is to deter the Soviet Union from carrying outits .threats with respect to Berlin, and to provide us with thenecessary military posture to achieve our common politicalobjectives in a Berlin crisis should one develop.SECRET

SECRETD.   Other NATO Strengthening.     It lies within the capabilitycjf the NATO powers to bring about a large increase in ourcollective non-nuclear military strength.     Some increase instrength could be managed within several weeks;   within sixmonths a major improvement in the basic military situationin Europe could take place.     The key to the potential changelies in our ground forces.While the number of men in active NATO units in theCentral Region is quite comparable to the Soviets1, many NATOdivisions are below proper levels in trained manpower, arepoorly equipped, and have inadequate stocks.     Most importantly,the Soviet ability to mobilize additional forces and movereinforcements into Central Europe well exceeds that of NATOforces.      In thirty days, the Soviets can more than doubletheir well-equipoed forces, while NATO can add only a littleover half to its M-Day strength, and the added units willmostly be poorly equipped.     In any case, the NATO stock levelsof equipment and supplies would probably not be adequate formuch more than 3 or h weeks of intensive combat.     This posturemay not deter Soviet action endangering our common interests.Being convinced that our objectives are best attainedthrough improving rapidly our real and visible capacity for non-nuclear air-ground action in Central Europe, while furtherstrengthening our already substantial nuclear strength, theU.S. has decided upon the program described in the precedingsection.     It involves U.S. readiness to make force contri-butions on a scale in excess of our MC-70 commitments.The U.S. expects its allies will wish to strengthen theircontributions to NATO concurrently.A suitable program might be in two phases.     In the first,from now until the end of 1961, M-Day forces agreed in MC-70would be brought up to the levels and standards agreed inMC-70.     At the same time, advance preparations of reserveforces would be intensified in anticipation of the second phase,to be -undertaken when and if it becomes clear that despiteour first phase actions the crisis continues.     The secondpha^e would entail bringing generally the remainder of theFirst Echelon forces of the Central Region to an active stateand deploying them as ready forces.To carry our this program, the NATO allies would act duringthe first phase so that as rapidly as possible they can havedeployed in the Central Area the numbers of combat readydivisions shown in Column A below.     Suitable preparations havingbeen made in the first phase for further strengthening, theNATO allies would be ready to deploy additional combat readydivisions into the Central Area to create the totals shown inColum B below.

SECRETDuring the first phase, Italy would also prepare twodivisions for deployment in the second phase.     Countries onNorthern and Southern flanks would increase their readystrength also.Besides these ground force reinforcements, some additionalair and naval strengthening would &quot;be needed and feasible duringthe time available.The following measures would apply to all members generally:a.    Increase to MC-70 standards the manning and equipmentlevels of existing active units.*b.   Maintain a minimum of an 18 month term of service.c. Establish war reserve stocks at 90-day operationallevel.d. Assume heightened state of readiness and acceleratethe combat readiness training of active units.e. Prepare during the first phase to bring second phaseunits rapidly to full combat readiness.f.   Accelerate the preparation of additional reserveforces through speeded production, intensified training, andmobilization exercises.g.   At an appropriate time transfer operational commandof selected forces to NATO commanders.The U.S. has set forth in the preceding section thosespecific measures which it intends to take in addition to themore generally applicable ones.     Other NATO governments willno doubt likewise wish to set out the comparable specificmeasures which would contribute toward our common aims. Anumber of impressions which the U.S. has * concerning some ofthese will be communicated to each government.The program as a whole would make evident our uniteddetermination to carry out cur commitments to defend thefreedom of the people of /vest Berlin and to act together inthe common defense.     Soviet leadership would be faced with new,compelling evidence that the allies were indeed prepared todeal with whatever situation grew out of a Soviet aggressionover Berlin.     In addition, the real NATO military capabilityand range, of alternatives would be improved..SECRET
