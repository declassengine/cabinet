Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1961C. (61) 113 Copy No.    5 121st July, 1961CABINETCIVIL AERODROMES: WHITE paper memorandum by the Minister of aviation at the meeting on 13th June, the Cabinet endorsed the approval given by theEconomic Policy Committee to my proposals for decentralising the ownership and operation of civil aerodromes. The Cabinet invited me to circulate a draft statement setting out the new policy (C.C. (61) 31st Conclusions, Minute 11).2. In the discussion of this matter, the view was expressed that since therewas little chance of time being found for legislation in the next Session, it mightbe best to defer publication of a White Paper and at this stage merely to make aless detailed statement of the Governments intentions. But I consider that a white Paper should be published as soon as possible. The setting up of an authority for the international airports at present run by the State is only one ofthe features of the new policy: there are other important aspects which do not depend on legislation. I wish to make an early start on the municipalisation ofairports serving the main centres of population and also to conclude agencyarrangements for the management of the airports serving the Scottish highlands and Islands and the Isles of Scilly. Similarly, it is highly desirable that theproposal to levy charges separately for technical services (for which the necessarylegislative sanction will be sought in the euro control Bill already in the programme for next Session) should be seen in its proper context as an essential feature ofour new policy.3. For these reasons, it is important that our policy should be explainedat greater length than could conveniently be contained in a statement inParliament. I therefore seek the agreement of my colleagues to publication ofthe attached draft White Paper before the Recess. The draft has been shownin confidence to the Northern Ireland Government who have no objection to its publication. The Association of Municipal Corporations and the AerodromeOwners Association have been informed in broad terms of what is proposed,and the Corporations of Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen will be similarlyinformed within the next few days.P.

CIVIL AERODROMES AND AIR NAVIGATIONALSERVICESThe Present position the State owns and operates 22 civil aerodromes. There are 25 municipaland 48 private aerodromes licensed for public transport. Those owned by theState range from large international airports such as Heathrow, Gatwick andPrestwick, to small aerodromes in the Scottish Highlands and Islands. Someof the. municipal airports, such as those at Manchester, Southend and birmingham, handle more traffic than many of the State aerodromes. Thoseowned privately differ widely in size and activity. Standards of safety are maintained at the municipal and private aerodromes through the requirement for annual licensing by the Minister of Aviation.2. The en route technical services, that is to say those necessary for the safenavigation of civil aircraft (air traffic control, navigational aids, telecommunications-tions and meteorological services), are provided by the State over the country as a whole. The aerodrome technical services, that is to say those necessaryfor the approach, take-off and landing of aircraft, are normally provided bythe aerodrome owner, i.e. by the Minister of Aviation at the State aerodromes,and by the respective aerodrome authorities at the rest. Exceptionalarrangements govern the provision of aerodrome technical services at the municipal airports at Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham, where theState has kept in its own hands the provision of these services as part of theterms on which it was agreed that the local authorities, rather than the State,should manage the airports.3. The present patterns of aerodrome ownership and of responsibility for technical services have developed over the past 25 years, during which time theair transport industry has grown from infancy to maturity. In consideringfuture policy it is advisable to bear in mind how the present arrangements have evolved.The historical background4. Before the war the main responsibility for providing aerodromes in theUnited Kingdom rested with local authorities, the only ones owned by theState being those at Croydon, Heston and Lympne. The State did not givefinancial assistance to aerodrome owners except that, in 1938, it was agreedthat grants should be made from the Exchequer towards the provision of fullnight-lighting equipment at certain main aerodromes.5. The State&apos;s responsibility for providing en route technical services, on theother hand, is of long standing and has been accepted by successive Govern-ments.   It was recognised from the outset, however, that the full cost of these
services should ultimately be paid by the operators of aircraft. Thus theMaybury Committee of 1937 emphasized that the help to be given to the new industry was to be of a temporary nature:In this examination and in framing our recommendations  that the necessaryradio facilities and air traffic control organisation should be provided bythe state we have considered that an appreciable measure of government assistance is desirable, and indeed essential at this stage, to secure asatisfactory degree of development, and that such assistance should begiven with the objective of eventually rendering civil aviation economicallyself-supporting. (Cmd. 5351.)6. At the end of the war the very great expansion in civil aviation, and theneed to provide extensive ground facilities that were beyond the financial resources of the industry, led to the decision that the State should not onlycontinue to provide the en route technical services, but should also own andmanage the major aerodromes required for scheduled services.7. The traffic served by the ground services has increased greatly since thewar. In 1946 fewer than three-quarters of a million passengers passed throughUnited Kingdom aerodromes; in 1960, the figure was over ten million. Thereis every reason to think that this trend will continue as the low-fares policypursued by the Government and the United Kingdom airlines brings air travelwithin the reach of a widening public.8. At the end of the war large programmes of capital development, forwhich only the State had the necessary resources, were required if this country was to play its proper part in civil aviation and derive full benefit from it.Large sums have accordingly been devoted to developing the ground services.Nearly  28 million have been spent in making Heathrow one of the finestairports in the world, handling more international passengers than any other.Gatwick has been built to play an important complementary role in handling the growing volume of air traffic to and from London. Prestwick has developed as the United kingdom&apos;s second international airport and muchwork, including the extension and strengthening of the runways and theconstruction of a new terminal building, has been and is being undertaken at prestwick to meet the requirements of the jet age. Programmes of develop-ment have also been carried out at other airports owned by the State.9. These programmes have been a major factor in enabling the UnitedKingdom to gain a leading position in civil aviation, which the Governmentare determined shall be retained. To this end, the supporting groundfacilities must continue to match the increasing demand, which has been made more complex by the introduction of larger and faster aircraft. The Govern-ment share the view expressed before the war that the full cost of paying forthese services should as far as possible be borne by the operators of aircraftwithout subvention from the taxpayer. This is the only sound basis for thelong-term prosperity of air transport. In recent years the Government have accordingly taken steps to increase the airlines&apos; share of the cost of providingground services, and they propose to continue with this policy, though they recognise that it may be some years still before the industry can be fully self-
supporting in this respect, and that there are certain facilities, such as some ofthe aerodromes in the remote parts of Scotland, which may need to be supportedby means of a direct subsidy.10. With these aims in mind, the Government have been reviewing thepresent arrangements for providing the ground services for civil aviation.Technical Services11. The first consideration must be the safety of aircraft, their passengers and crews. At present the technical services provided by the State arerecognised to be as good as any in the world. The Government intend tomaintain this position.12. On operational and technical grounds it is necessary that the civil en route services should continue to be provided by a single agency covering thewhole country, and the close interaction between en route services and aerodrometechnical services at certain main aerodromes make sit highly desirable that thesame agency should provide the technical services at those main aerodromes.13. The enjroute services provided for civil air traffic in this country need tobe co-ordinated with those required for military air traffic. Some facilities arealready used in common, and integration is likely to go further in future.Moreover the systems must be compatible with those in operation in othercountries, and international collaboration at Government level is needed toensure this. The United Kingdom is already bound to such collaboration asa member of the International Civil Aviation Organisation; and under theEurocontrol Convention air traffic control in the upper air space of member states, including the United Kingdom, is to become the responsibility of aninternational agency. The Government therefore propose to retain direct responsibility for providing en route services, and also to provide the technicalservices at aerodromes where these interact closely with the en route services,or where other special circumstances require it. Technical services at theremaining aerodromes will be the responsibility of the local aerodromeauthorities.Ownership and Management of Aerodromes14. Some of the circumstances which led to the adoption of the policy thataerodromes required for scheduled services should be owned and administered by the State no longer apply. Thus the establishment of the national pattern of civil aerodromes after the war involved such questions as the widespreadcompulsory acquisition of land, the transfer of numerous aerodromes from military to civil use, and the need for substantial expenditure of public funds to establish and operate the civil aerodromes. There was no early prospect ofmaking the aerodromes pay, and any alternative ownership would have been heavily dependent on grants from the Exchequer, and so would have had little
freedom of management. Central control and financing were essential toavoid dislocation and delay in providing aerodrome facilities at a crucial timein the development of air transport.15. At the end of the war the operating losses at the aerodromes taken overby the State were large, and the prospects of eliminating them appeared to beremote. The financial prospects have now changed. Direct Departmentalmanagement and development have brought the aerodromes to a position inwhich it is possible to consider transferring their ownership and operation toother hands. In the present financial year the revenues of Heathrow areexpected to cover all the operating costs and also interest on capital and depreci-ation. The role of the other aerodromes owned by the State is also clearerthan it was in the early post-war years. Central control, although essential tothe establishment of a co-ordinated network of aerodromes, is no longer necessary for running it. There is now less need for assistance from theGovernment, or for direct Ministerial responsibility and supervision overday-to-day matters in what is largely a business enterprise.16. The Government have therefore decided that the time has come todecentralise the ownership and management of the State aerodromes. Incarrying out this policy, they will concern themselves to ensure that satisfactory arrangements are made to safeguard, as far as possible, the employmentinterests of the staff concerned.17. The new arrangements for the ownership and operation of the aero-dromes must take account of the wide differences which exist between them,both in size and in the nature of the facilities now provided or likely to berequired in the future. For example, the running of a major internationalairport such as Heathrow or Prestwick is quite a different business from the running of a small aerodrome in the Scottish Islands. From this point ofview the aerodromes fall into the following four groups:Group london (Heathrow)London (Gatwick)StanstedPrestwickGroup IIBournemouthBlackpool (negotiations on the future of this aerodrome are currentlytaking place with the Git$ c^porahonCardiffBelfastGlasgowEdinburghAberdeen
InvernessBenbeculaIslayKirkwallMachrihanishStornowaySumburghTireeWickGroup IVAirports serving the Isles of Scilly (St. Just and St. Mary&apos;s)Group I18. The first group comprises the principal international airports owned bythe State (including Stansted, which is at present one of the airports in theLondon group). In 1960/61 their gross revenue was over  6.5 million, and in1960 the passengers at these airports made up nearly 60 per cent of the totalnumber using United Kingdom aerodromes. The airports in this group havea closely co-ordinated function as the principal gateways into the country for normal scheduled services. They also form a convenient unit for managementwhich is at the same time large enough to offer a reasonable career structure and variety of work and to be attractive to able men. Furthermore, theseairports are collectively within sight of paying their way.19. The Government have therefore come to the conclusion that an AirportAuthority should be set up to own and manage the main international airportsnow owned by the State, and to plan, build and manage any new ones eventuallyrequired. The Authority might also be made responsible for providing andmanaging an international heliport in Central London. It may be noted that similar arrangements have been made for many of the main internationalairports in Europe and in the United States.20. The Government are giving further consideration to the form which an authority for tbe$ international group of airports should take. The necessary legislation for establishing the Authority will be introduced when details of itsstructure and functions have been fully worked out.Group II21. The second group comprises aerodromes, other than the principalinternational gateways, which serve some of the main centres of population inthe United Kingdom. Although the cost of operating them is at present a charge on the general body of taxpayers, they serve primarily local needs,though with different degrees of value to the nation as a whole.22. Since the war there have already been cases in which the ownership andcontrol of aerodromes have been decentralised from State to local management.In 1950 it was decided as an exception to the policy of State-ownership for
aerodromes needed for scheduled services not to acquire Manchester Airport,but to make an agreement with the City Corporation under which the latter would be responsible for the future development and management of the airport. Subsequently similar arrangements have been entered into with the corporations of Birmingham and Liverpool. More recently, the former/yState-owned aerodrome at Southampton has been taken over by a privateconcern. These developments, together with the fact that a considerablenumber of aerodromes have never been taken over by the State, mean that,over the country as a whole and apart from the airports in Group I, the Ministerof Aviation now operates only seven aerodromes serving large centres of population, whereas 25, including a number at which the traffic exceeds thatat some of the seven, are operated by municipalities. Against this backgroundthere appears to be insufficient justification for requiring the taxpayers to meetautomatically the full cost of providing these seven aerodromes, while therate payers at certain places, in addition to their obligation as taxpayers, meetthe full costs of their local aerodromes.23. Experience both in this country and abroad has shown that localresponsibility for the development and management of aerodromes has manyadvantages. Users&apos; needs are more easily identified and catered for, and localmanagement is in a better position than the Government to adapt its standards of passenger-handling services and costs to suit local needs and circumstances.In developing non-aviation revenue through concessions, and in providingmanagement services generally, local management should be able to make useof facilities already existing for other purposes without corresponding extraexpense.24. In short, local pride and prestige, coupled with local knowledge andfinancial responsibility, and with the help of an advisory service from theGovernment, should provide the best setting for the provision of good and efficient aerodromes of this kind without extravagance.25. The Government have therefore decided that the future development ofthe aerodromes in Group II can best be furthered under local ownership and management with the support of local resources. The most suitable form oflocal management would be for the local authorities to assume the primeresponsibility for their ownership and operation, thus bringing these aerodromesinto line with the well established pattern which has been adopted successfullyin other parts of the country.26. The Government have already discussed these proposals in general terms with the Association of Municipal Corporations, the Aerodrome OwnersAssociation, and appropriate authorities in Scotland. They have also discussed the application of the policy of decentralisation in Northern Ireland with theNorthern Ireland Government. TheGovernment propose to open negotiations in the near future with the appropriate authorities about the future arrangementsfor these airports.Government Aid for Aerodromes27. The Government recognise that some aerodromes serving main centres of population meet a national as well as a local need.   Where the cost of
running these aerodromes would place an unduly heavy burden on localresources, it would be reasonable for the local authorities to expect theGovernment to give some assistance in recognition of the contribution madeby the aerodrome towards the air transport needs of the nation as a whole.28. Any application by a local authority for Government financial aid,whether to continue operating an aerodrome after previous Governmentmanagement or to support an aerodrome already under local control, will beconsidered on the merits of the particular case. Among the criteria that willbe adopted, two will be of particular importance: whether the aerodrome inquestion is regarded as one of the limited number indispensable to the national transport system; and, if so, whether the local&apos;authority needs help.29. The test of indispensability will be strict. Account will be taken, inter alia, of the location of other aerodromes and the facilities there, the population in the area served by the aerodrome, the existence and convenience of alternative means of travel, the likely growth of traffic in the future, and the prospect ofthe aerodrome paying its way within a reasonable period of time.30. The test of the local authority&apos;s need for assistance will also be strict.The local authority will need to show that the financial loss likely to be incurred in running the aerodrome at appropriate standards is greater than the local community can reasonably be expected to bear.Group III31. The aerodromes of the third group are in the remote parts of Scotland.They are never likely to pay their way, but they are at present essential to the economy and social welfare of the areas they serve. The Government recognise the importance of these aerodromes, and that there is no scope for transferringtheir ownership to the local communities. They do, however, form ahomogenous unit for management, and the Government are therefore exploringthe possibility of arranging for the management to be carried out by an agenton their behalf. Arrangements will be made for the cost to the Exchequer ofsubsidising these aerodromes to be separately identified in the national accounts.Group IV32. The aerodromes at Land&apos;s End and the Isles of Scilly also fall into aspecial category similar to Group III, and for these too the Government will seek to make arrangements for management by an agent.Financial Implications33. The proposals outlined in this paper for decentralising the ownership ofmany of the aerodromes now owned by the State mean that it will not bepossible for the Government^ general policy of making air transport ultimatelyself-sufficient to be implemented by progressive increases in landing fees alone.The revenues at these aerodromes, including landing charges, will in futureaccrue to the new owners. Group I, comprising the international airports,should soon be able to pay its way.   In respect of the aerodromes in Group II,
si:     it.there will be a saving to the Exchequer as a result of transferring responsibility to local authorities, though some continuing financial assistance from the state may be needed for a period. It is expected that a small number of aerodromes at present not supported by Exchequer grants will ffifeewe^assistance for their development in rnnnrmitinn nf tVinir nmn.t,ri^intinn tn n^tinnnl rnqi jii i&apos;j 111 qrfo:34. Since the new policy will have the result that the ownership of the aerodromes and the provision of the en route technical services (and aerodrometechnical services in some cases) will be in different hands, new arrangements will have to be made for payment for the use of the technical services providedby the State. The Government consider that it would be right to levy charges for the use of these services, as was envisaged when central provision of air traffic control and communications was first undertaken in 1937. Powers tolevy such charges will accordingly be sought from Parliament. It will not be practicable to recover fees sufficient at the outset to meet the full cost of thetechnical services, but the aim will be to increase the fees progressively untilthe cost is borne entirely by the civil aviation industry.35. Although the Government^ proposals will reduce the burden on the taxpayer, it cannot be eliminated immediately; some payments from theExchequer towards ground facilities for civil aviation will have to continue.Jfe-/rtfe*ie.The rate of progress made towards financial self-sufficiency will need to be very carefully considered in the light of what the industry can bear at any particulartime, but it is right that people travelling by air should pay an increasing partof the cost, and ultimately the whole cost, of the ground services. The totalcharges levied on the users of the ground services, and their make-up as betweenthe charges levied by the State towards the cost of the technical services on theone hand, and charges levied by the aerodrome owners for the use of theirfacilities on the other, will have to be kept under constant review. But theGovernment are convinced that the proposals outlined in this White Paperprovide the best way of meeting the two fundamental aims of their policy,namely to ensure the continued efficiency of the ground services and to makeair transport self-supporting as soon as possible in order to secure the longterm prosperity of the industry.
