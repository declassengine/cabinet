C (61)143 Copy No.   5327th September, 1961CABINETFUTURE RELATIONS WITH SOUTH africa memorandum by the Lord chancellor on 2nd August I circulated a memorandum (C. (61) 126) setting out theconclusions of the Africa Committee on recommendations by officials covering a wide range of problems relating to this subject. The Cabinet endorsed these conclusions at their meeting on 3rd August (C.C. (61) 47th Conclusions, Minute 2).2. In so doing the Cabinet accepted my view that it was unnecessary to trouble them with a number of relatively minor matters with which the AfricaCommittee had dealt. The Committee have since considered four additionalquestions with which I again consider it unnecessary to trouble the Cabinet: butmy colleagues may wish to know the Committee&apos;s conclusions upon them and Iam therefore circulating this memorandum for their information.Press Telegraph Rates to South africa. The main problem is the rate for ordinary Press telegrams. Wecould not, in face of certain and strong protests from the CommonwealthTelecommunications Board and international Press Agencies, justify retention for south Africa of the Commonwealth rate of Id. a word. On the other hand, to goon to the normal foreign rate of 7d. a word would cause a sharp reduction in press traffic, weakening our influence on South African opinion and our contact with those South Africans with whom we wish to remain in touch, and might alsocause friction between South Africa and the High Commission Territories (forwhich we must retain the Id. rate) as a result of traffic for South Africa beingrouted through the Territories. The Committee have therefore approved a recommendation by officials that the new South African rate should be a compromise at 4+d. The Committee have also agreed that the rate for urgentPress telegrams to South Africa (in which traffic is very light) should go up from6d. to Is. lOd. a word. This conforms with international practice, which weconsistently observe except in relation to the United States (to avoid urgenttelegrams being routed through Canada). The rate for the High commission territories will remain at 6d. Finally, the Committee have agreed that theCommonwealth rates should at the same time be withdrawn from Burma, israel and Jordan. It has for some time been intended to do this and the necessaryintroduction of new arrangements for South Africa provides a suitable opportunity.Nationality4. On 3rd August the Cabinet agreed that most South Africans would infuture have to be treated as aliens but that South African citizens withcertain strong connexions with the United Kingdom should be given until31st December, 1965, to register as citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies and that, to allow time for adequate warning to be given to those civil servants,solicitors, &amp;c, who would be statutorily barred from continuing their employmentunless they became United Kingdom citizens, such disqualification should be59710THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

suspended until the same date. Further consideration has since been given to thejflbpossibility of extending the period of grace for any persons in either of these^^categories who might fail to register through no fault of their own. TheCommittee have endorsed the view expressed by officials that such an extensionwould be both unjustified and impracticable. They thought that a period of gracerunning three and a half years was amply generous and that, in view of the wide publicity which would certainly attend the new arrangements, there was little likelihood that anyone would fail to register through no fault of his own.Moreover, any provision for acceptance of late applications would in effect amountto an indefinite extension of the period of grace, for which there was no realprecedent in our nationality law. The Cabinefs decision on this issue will thusstand without modification.Aliens Control5. The Committee have accepted recommendations by officials that until31st December, 1962, South Africans should be exempted from aliens control tothe same extent as were the Burmese and Somalis during the initial periods oftheir independence, and that South Africans should not be subject to visa providedthat the South African Government accord reciprocity. The effect of the first ofthese recommendations is to exempt South Africans from aliens control for19 months from the time they left the Commonwealth, as compared with the periods of 15 months and 12 months allowed to the Burmese and Somalisrespectively. The visa provision conforms with our general policy throughout theworld.Teachers&apos; Superannuation6. Under the Teachers&apos; Superannuation Acts teachers on &quot; approved externalservice &quot; in Her Majesty&apos;s dominions can count that service for pension. provision is necessary to protect British teachers who went to South Africa on theunderstanding that they would enjoy this protection. The Committee have therefore approved a recommendation by officials that the relevant provisions should continue to apply to teachers in approved external service in South africa on 31st May, 1962, or, in order to include any teachers who might be betweencontracts of service on that date, at any time within the preceding three months.K.House of Lords, S.W. 1,26th September, 1961.
