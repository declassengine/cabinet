(61) 1452nd October, 1961CABINETKUWAITNote by the Acting Secretary of the CabinetI attach a copy of a minute, dated 26th September, from the Minister of defence to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has approved the request for theauthority contained in Annex A to the minute; and has directed that the request for the authority contained in Annex B should be considered by the Cabinet.(Signed)      F. A. BISHOP.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,29th September, 1961.Copy No.51Prime Minister,The actual withdrawal of our forces from Kuwait is about to begin andwe cannot ignore the possibility that during the period of withdrawal Kasim mayattack Kuwait. In this situation there will be a diminishing number of British troopsactually in the country. It will be necessary for the Commander-in-Chief, middle east, to act very promptly, and I think you will agree that there can be no doubt thatwe should reverse the withdrawal of our forces, on the assumption that we have a request from the Amir.2. I should therefore like your agreement to authorise the Commander-in-Chief to do this, provided he has a request from the Amir and provided the Political Resident Persian Gulf agrees. I attach at Annex A the terms in whichI propose to give him this delegated authority.3. There is another important question, which we shall have to consider once the withdrawal from Kuwait is completed. We agreed in Cabinet on the5th September to re-examine our military commitments to Kuwait, and a report by officials will shortly be available to us. If we should decide to continue to rely oneffective military means of safeguarding the Amir&apos;s position we shall be acceptingconsiderable risks if we do not allow the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, to take any action, after an appeal from the Ruler for assistance, until he has instructions from the Government in London. If the presence of the Arab League force doesnot deter Iraq from attacking, we cannot rely on the Arab League force holding upthe attack for any worthwhile time. They have not the military effectiveness to doso. Nor have the forces of the Amir.59717^^THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

2TOP secret. As a result of an examination which the Chiefs of Staff have undertaken, it^gteahas become clear that we should, at best, have some 15 hours from the timewhen the first unconfirmed reports originate in Kuwait of an Iraqi attack to the time by which the Commander-in-Chief can receive authority to act from London. even this period of 15 hours assumes that Ministers could have been got together orforewarned whilst confirmation was on its way that the attack had, in fact, started.5. The military consequences of this to-day mean that we should lose theopportunity to achieve a favourable air situation and engage Iraqi ground forcesbefore they come into contact with and (from the point of view of air action) become^indistinguishable from Arab League Forces. In consequence of this, the move forward of our forces would be delayed.6. We could avoid these military disadvantages by giving the Commander-in-Chief delegated authority to take certain action once he has satisfied himself thatthe Amir has made a formal request for our military help and that Iraq has, in fact,attacked. I attach at Annex B the draft of a Directive which would be appropriateif we were to take this decision.7. I hope you will agree that I should forthwith delegate authority to theCommander-in-Chief to take action if Iraq attacks during the process of withdrawal,in the terms of Annex A; and that we should consider, in the light of our future policyin Kuwait, the further delegation of authority, the terms of which are set out in annex B.8.   I have copied this minute to the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.H. W.26th September, 1961.
If the Iraqis should attack Kuwait during the period of withdrawal, you are authorised, subject to the P.R.P.G.&apos;s concurrence, to assist in its defence at therequest of the Amir, introducing such reinforcements as you consider necessary.ANNEX draft DIRECTIVE TO THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, MIDDLE EAST,ON INTERVENTION IN KUWAIT AFTER WITHDRAWAL1. After the withdrawal of your forces from Kuwait, you should be preparedfor their speedy reintroduction to meet any Iraqi attack.2. Subject to the agreement of the Amir, PR reconnaissance of Iraq from theKuwait side of the border may be flown from Bahrein at any time, at yourdiscretion.3. Provided you are satisfied that the Amir has made a formal request formilitary help, and that Iraqi forces have crossed the frontier or attacked targets&quot; in kuwait from the air, you are authorised to:id) Carry out offensive air action against Iraqi ground and air forces in and overKuwait. This authority covers hot pursuit of Iraqi aircraft to a distance15 miles inside Iraq territory.(b) Deploy forward to Kuwait DF / GA forces at your discretion and any extramen to activate the stockpile and operate Type T radar on more thana one watch basis.(c) Complete all necessary measures for intervention short of deploying yourremaining forces into Kuwait.id) Extend PR reconnaissance into Iraq territory, but this must be limited to high altitude flights that do not penetrate beyond the Basra area.4. You are also authorised to engage Iraqi aircraft in the event of theirattacking Sharjah, Bahrein or British forces at sea, and, if necessary, to pursuethem as far as the Iraq border.5. British forces, except for DF/GA aircraft, are not to be deployed in kuwait, nor is any offensive action to be taken against Iraqi forces apart from thatauthorised in paragraphs 3 and 4 above, without further specific authority fromthe Chiefs of Staff.ANNEX A
