But, on the assumption that the United Kingdom decides tojoin, all territories expressing a view on the desirability of A.O.T. status being applied to them have come down in favour of an attempt being made to negotiatesuch status. Some territories, however, have made reservations which we should bear in mind in any negotiation. Tanganyika, in particular, will wish to ensurethat the acceptance of A.O.T. status would be on the basis of equality and free ofany &quot; imperialist taint &quot;; on her decision will depend whether Kenya and probablyUganda will confirm their present wish to seek A.O.T. status. Singapore and theBorneo territories will look at A.O.T. status in the light of its compatibility with a future greater Malaysia. Also, most territories will need *to ensure that their freedom to impose sufficient import duties to safeguard their revenue and infantindustries is maintained. However, within these qualifications, I consider thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government have received a very strong pronouncement that the dependent territories would wish a suitable form of A.O.T. status to be sought toprotect their interests in the event of a settlement being reached with the Six. Inspite of the Indian doubts noted by the Minister of Aviation, it seems to me essentialthat we should seek a suitable form of A.O.T. status at any rate for those of ourdependent territories which want it; indeed assurances have been given, by theMinister of Labour to the Government of the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland and by the Minister of State to the West Indies, that we shall do so.The upshot of the recent discussions between Euro-African parliamentarianssuggests that it should be possible to agree on a form of A.O.T. status which under-developed countries could regard as compatible with genuine independence.6. So far as the dependent territories are concerned I am sure that it wouldbe advantageous if the present state of uncertainty could be brought to an end as quickly as possible i.e., if we could start without further delay negotiations witha view to finding out what terms we can get.I. M.
ANNEX ASUMMARY OF THE REACTIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL territories the West IndiesThe Minister of State for Colonial Affairs had discussions with the Cabinetsof the Federal Government, the Trinidad Government and the JamaicaGovernment. He also participated in a two-day Conference with representativesof the Federal Government and all the unit Governments in the West Indies (exceptDominica).  His report is at Annex B.2. The main concern of the West Indies Governments was that their UnitedKingdom markets and their special privileges therein should not be affected, or if affected, that they should receive compensation. They believed that the best way to achieve this would be for them to obtain A.O.T. status, though they evenwanted additional provisos and safeguards which we certainly could not obtainfor them in full. They naturally accepted that the British Government had theright to take their own decisions in this matter, and they did, after some argument,agree to go publicly on record that they would understand if the British Governmentshould decide to open negotiations with the European Economic Community&quot; provided that the interests of the West Indies were fully protected &quot;. Theyinsisted on this proviso because they were afraid that if they did not, they wouldbe held to have admitted that the United Kingdom could not expect to&apos; join without some change in their present trading arrangements, and that this would reduce their right to compensation.3. The West Indies Governments were most concerned to ensure that theywould be fully consulted at all stages. Both the Federal Government and the unit Governments expect to be represented on any body which may be set up to consult with the Commonwealth collectively.British Guiana4. The Minister of State spent two hours with Dr. Jagan, Minister of Tradeand Industry in British Guiana, and with his Financial Secretary. Paragraph 5of Annex B gives his report of that discussion. Dr. Jagan believed that for theUnited Kingdom to join the Six would be a mistake both for the United Kingdomitself and for the Commonwealth. It was strange to hear Dr. Jagan in the role ofa champion of Commonwealth interests. He was not pressed to say whether hewould like A.O.T. status for Brtiish Guiana since Dutch Guiana (Surinam) does nothave that status. He was given the usual undertaking that his Government wouldbe closely consulted if we enter into negotiations.British Honduras5. The Government of British Honduras were invited to send representatives to meet the Minister of State in Trinidad or Jamaica but were unable to do so. Ina written statement of their views, they consider that their interests would best be served by the United Kingdom not joining the European Communit)&apos; but that, ifthis does come about, they would wish to obtain A.O.T. status.Singapore6. The Minister of Aviation had talks with the Singapore Government during his Asian journey, and is reporting separately.East Africa7. The Minister of State took the opportunity of the presence in London ofMinisters from Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika to have talks with them here. they felt it necessary, however, to reserve their judgment until they had been able todiscuss the matter more fully between themselves.8. Each of the three territories has an important export trade with the UnitedKingdom, but it is Kenya&apos;s interests, and to a lesser extent Tanganyika&apos;s, which areperhaps most heavily at risk due to the growing reliance of farmers on the United59342
Kingdom market to dispose of their temperate agricultural produce. Having made this point of particular importance, the Kenya Government take the view that A.O.T.status should be sought on their behalf, provided that the Uganda and TanganyikaGovernments are of the same mind on their own behalf. Uganda does in fact take this view, considering that she would gain more by securing access to the common market on equal terms with the present A.O.Ts. of the Six than she would lose bythe disappearance of her preferences in the United Kingdom against the A.O.Ts. andthe Six themselves.9. Tanganyika, which becomes independent in December, is howeverunwilling to give a final reply on the question of A.O.T. status until Mr. Nyerere,the Prime Minister, returns to the country from America and can be consulted. Heis passing through London on 20th July and we will talk to him then. During thediscussions which the Minister of State had in London there were indications thatTanganyika Ministers were not without some of the suspicions concerning thepossible political implications of A.O.T. status with which the Minister of Labourmet in West Africa.10. Zanzibar, which has close geographical and economic links with EastAfrica, is in a somewhat different position as her most important single customer isIndia. The preferences which Zanzibar enjoys in India for her exports of cloves andcopra under the Anglo-Indian Trade Agreement of 1939 are important to her, and ifthese should lapse as a result of a termination of that Agreement, and not be replaced by bilateral arrangements, the effects could be serious. Whether or not Zanzibarbecame an A.O.T. comes second in importance to the preservation of thesepreferences.Hong Kong11. Hong Kong undoubtedly poses the most difficult problem among the dependent territories. There seems little real possibility that Hong Kong would obtain any benefit from a settlement between the United Kingdom and the Six.On the other hand, there is clearly a very great danger that she would lose, notablyas a result of the imposition of reverse preferences against her and in favour ofthe Six in the United Kingdom market, and by the loss of preferences else wherein the Commonwealth as a result of a general revision of the preferential system.The Governor therefore states categorically that Hong Kong&apos;s interests would best be served by the United Kingdom remaining outside the Common Market. Ifthis does not happen, he would recommend that an attempt should be made eitherto secure A.O.T. status for Hong Kong or, failing that, preservation of Hong Kong&apos;present freedom of access to the United Kingdom market.Other Territories12. The remaining territories can conveniently be considered in the followingbroad groups.13. First, there are the main sugar-producing dependencies outside the west indies, namely Mauritius and Fiji. The Minister of State had discussions with ministers from Mauritius in London. Provided that in any settlement betweenthe United Kingdom and the Six arrangements were made which gave Mauritius1exports of sugar to the United Kingdom broadly equivalent treatment to thatwhich is at present enjoyed their most important interest here would be safeguarded,but there would remain a danger to their preferential markets elsewhere in theCommonwealth. Mauritius takes the view that A.O.T. status would be best forthem both generally and as an additional safeguard for their sugar exports to theUnited Kingdom.  Fiji, which has similar interests, holds the same view.14. Secondly, there are the South-East Asian territories of Sarawak, north borneo and Brunei. These territories conduct a good deal of their trade in theFar East, and with India and Autralia, but the first two at least have importantmarkets for their produce in the United Kingdom and the Six. If we decide to seek membership of the European Community, then economic considerations would lead these territories to desire A.O.T. status. However, the Borneo territories are,with Singapore and the Federation of Malaya, involved in the longer term concept of a greater Malaysia and, like Singapore, would not wish to get out of step with
these other territories. They would therefore wish to ensure that any special arrangements which may be made for them in relation to the European marketstakes account of their common interest in their own regional grouping.15. Next, nearer home, there are the Mediterranean territories of Malta and gibraltar. Being within the Treaty of Rome&apos;s category of &quot; European territoriesfor whose external relations a Member State is responsible &quot;, these territories mighthave an additional option of becoming full members of the Community. From theinformation so far available this may be too rigorous a commitment for them, andthat A.O.T. or some other associated status would be preferred.16. In addition to the territories whose views are indicated above, there are some whom it has not been possible to consult in the time available. But theconclusions to be drawn from the views already received are not likely to beinvalidated by the outstanding replies from the remaining territories.July, 1961.ANNEX BREPORT BY THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR COLONIAL AFFAIRS ONHIS VISIT TO THE WEST INDIES, JULY 1961I first had a meeting easy and relaxed with Sir Grantley Adams the PrimeMinister of the Federation and the Federal Cabinet; then, over two days, threelong sessions with the Federal and Unit Governments 40 delegates, weak, ignorantof the subject and hostile to each other. The final outcome was the press communique on the lines of the New Zealand communique (Appendix A) which states that they would understand if the United Kingdom decided to enternegotiations provided their interests were fully protected! Even this took an hourto achieve because they were afraid lest someday this &quot; understanding &quot; wouldbe held to be approval of the fact that the United Kingdom could not expect tojoin without some changes in the present trading arrangements! The list of their interests (vital? !) range from arrowroot to tonka beans (Appendix B) and with itthere is a memorandum stating their requirements (Appendix C).2. Subsequently I had meetings with Dr. Eric Williams and his TrinidadCabinet and then travelled to Jamaica to do the same with Mr. Manley and his cabinet. Both were concerned that I should again hear of their islands&apos; interests.Otherwise the meetings passed happily. I spoke at a Trinidad Chamber ofCommerce lunch, 150 strong, and had a meeting with the leading Jamaican business and agricultural groups.3. I believe the visit and the chance it gave me to explain what it was all about,was very worthwhile as there was no knowledge and deep concern that the UnitedKingdom was to give up the Commonwealth and sacrifice the West Indies. when left there was I think appreciation that we had&apos;t even started to negotiate,that the choice for us was not Commonwealth or Europe, that we would seek to protect vital West Indies interests and that we would consult. The local Presswere very helpful.4.   What are the conclusions from the visit?(a) Above all that uncertainty be removed and that we decide soon whether to enter negotiations and if so the shorter the negotiations the better.As long as they are looked after the West Indies are quite content withwhatever the United Kingdom may do.(b) The West Indies would (I think rightly) like A.O.T. status about whichthere was a very full discussion. I warned them I could not tell whetherthey would be eligible as being sufficiently undeveloped but hoped so.In this connexion there is a point we need to watch vis-a-vis their independence next year if they thought Independence would make them ineligible some might seize on this excuse to postpone itshappening and jeopardise Federation (incidentally Mr. Manley&apos;campaing for Federation on which he shortly has a referendum is going well).
Colonial Office, S.W.1,15th July, 1961.APPENDIX a press COMMUNIQUEThe West Indies under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister of the west indies have had discussions with the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs, the earl of Perth.2. Lord Perth explained that the British Government were concerned aboutthe future consequences, both economic and political, of continued division inEurope and were therefore re-examining their relationship with the european economic Community. Before deciding whether to enter into negotiations withthe community they were seeking the views of the Commonwealth. The BritishGovernment had not yet come to any decision whether or not to enter into such negotiations and would not do so until views of all Commonwealth countries hadbeen fully considered. Lord Perth gave the assurance that if Britain entered into negotiations the West Indian Governments and other commonwealth governments would be closely consulted at all stages.3. West Indian Ministers stated that the question of Britain&apos;s entry into theCommon Market was a matter for the United Kingdom to decide. While theyindicated their appreciation of Great Britain&apos;s problems they pointed out thataccession posed a serious threat to vital West Indies interests; agricultural products,particularly citrus, bananas and sugar and other products, particularly oil andbauxite. They insisted therefore that if Britain decided to join the european economic Community these vital West Indies interests must be safeguarded and every effort be made to secure, as they would hope might be the case, the maximumadvantages for the West Indies.   The West Indian Ministers also stressed the- ;-. (c) Preservation of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement is vital to the west indies and British Guiana, and of course oil is an even greater moneyspinner; citrus and bananas are also very important and lastly bauxiteand alumina are of great value to them (the investment in Jamaicaalone is  120 millions) and British Guiana. The export of these oresis in the main to Canada and so there is deep concern about any arrangements made for Canada&apos;s aluminium.(d) The West Indies are extremely anxious that they (Federal and UnitGovernments) should be adequately consulted on those items in whichthey are interested and I gave appropriate assurances.(e) In general the only concern of all the West Indians is that their UnitedKingdom markets and their special privileges therein are unaffectedor if affected that they be compensated. Perhaps for the first time theyare beginning to realise how much we do for them!5. I had two hours with Dr. Jagan of British Guiana who flew over to seems. He had given the question more profound thought than any of the WestIndians and felt that if we went in the Commonwealth over a period must feel the change. He had decided that for us to do so would be a mistake. After ourtalk, which was friendly and objective, in a Press interview he said he was afraidwe might be choosing the shadow and losing the bone so my talk appearedslightly to have raised doubts in his mind. I deliberately did not develop thequestion of A.O.T. status with him Dutch Guiana has not got it. I said I waswell aware of his country&apos;s main interests sugar and bauxite and that we would keep in touch.
importance of their trade relationships with Canada and insisted that should theUnited Kingdom decide to join the European Common Market every possible step should be taken to ensure that these relationships with Canada were notadversely affected.4. Lord Perth assured them that the British Government fully understood the importance to the West Indies of their market in the United Kingdom. he explained that Britain would not expect to be able to join the Common Market ofthe European Economic Community without some changes in the present arrangements for Commonwealth goods in the United Kingdom, but this did not mean that the vital interests of the West Indies and others of the Commonwealthcould not be protected. In this connexion he made it clear that in the course ofany negotiations the British Government would seek to secure special arrangements to protect these vital interests, and that Britain would not feel able to join theEuropean Economic Community unless such arrangements were secured. The west indian Ministers recommended special arrangements to meet the vital interests ofthe West Indies.5. West Indian Ministers welcomed the discussion with Lord Perth asenabling both sides to appreciate the problems involved. They would understandif the British Government should decide to open negotiations with the european economic Community provided that the interests of the West Indies are fullyprotected. In that event they stated that they would be prepared and would expect to participate in the subsequent consultations envisaged.APPENDIX BCOMMODITIES OF INTEREST TO THE WEST INDIESArrowrootAsphaltBananasBittersCigarsCitrus (including juices, fresh, grapefruit segments)CoffeeCocoaCottonGingerLime ProductsBauxite and AluminaFertilisersMolassesPetroleum and its Products including petrochemicals, resinsRumLiquersSugarNutmeg and MaceManufacturing Industries, i.e., lingerie, points, textiles, artificial teeth, foodproducts, &amp;c.Tonka Beans
APPENDIX CSafeguards required by the West Indies if the United Kingdom decides toenter into negotiation with the Six with a view to joining the European economic community (E.E.C.).(a) The West Indies would wish to secure A.O.T. status.(b) The United Kingdom should ensure that the level of trade between theWest Indies and the European Free Trade Association, E.E.C. anditself should not be less than the average of 1958-60.(c) The reality of Canadian trade must not be given up for the prospect of increased trade with E.E.C. and our Canadian trade must be maintained.id) Existing quota restrictions maintained by many E.E.C. countries againstmanufactured goods from the under-developed countries ie.g., textiles)in contravention of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade wouldhave to be dismantled. This is a general Commonwealth problemrather than a specifically West Indian problem. Also high tariffs onmanufactured goods of interest to the under-developed countries shouldbe reduced.ie) There must be no involvement of the West Indies in world politics(especially in Africa) consequent on A.O.T. status.(/) The West Indies Governments must have complete freedom in fixing thelevel of their tariffs including the levying of duties for fiscal anddevelopment purposes.ig) As regards freedom of movement between the West Indies and europe the normal type of disability which usually faces West Indians shouldnot exist, but there should be the right of freedom to seek employmentin the Community.ih) Consultation on a bilateral basis is unsatisfactory since a commodity mayconcern more than one member of the Commonwealth, e.g., petroleumconcerns Nigeria as well as Trinidad. Multilateral consultation wouldseem to be preferable and if any Commonwealth Conference is convenedon the question of United Kingdom entry into the Common Market no constitutional technicality should preclude West Indies representationand in particular representation by Territorial Governments such asTrinidad and Tobago. In the discussion of particular commodities, e.g.,aluminium, it would also be desired that other Commonwealth countries such as Canada who had an essential interest in the product should alsobe associated with the discussions.(/) If the West Indies were to be given A.O.T. status their participation in control and management of the Development Fund should be ensured.(/&apos;) The West Indies should be free to negotiate commercial treaties with third countries subject to any international obligation such as the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade.ik) West Indies present trading arrangements in the sense of the long-term contracts and negotiated prices for exports which the West Indies nowenjoy ie.g., Commonwealth Sugar Agreement and contracts relatingto citrus) must in no way be affected. Moreover, this must relate notonly to existing contracts but also to the renewal of such contracts fromtime to time.(/) In the event that the United Kingdom joined the E.E.C. without being ableto achieve for the West Indies the status of an A.O.T. with the safeguardsrequested by the West Indies, the United Kingdom would undertaketo have discussions with the Commonwealth and the West Indies (as amember of the Commonwealth) on the question of compensation forany loss of preference that might ensue from Britain joining theCommon Market.
