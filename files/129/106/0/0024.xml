W. 1.28th July, 1961.
ANNEX a revised DRAFT STATEMENT BY THEPRIME MINISTER ON THE COMMON MARKETWith permission, I wish to make a Statement on the policy ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government towards the European Economic Community.The future relations between the European Economic Community, theUnited Kingdom, the Commonwealth and the rest of Europe are clearlymatters of capital importance in the life of our country and indeed ofall the countries of the Free World.2.      The problem is political as well as economic.    Although theTreaty of Rome is concerned with economic matters it has an important political objective, namely, to promote unity and stability in europe which is so essential a factor in the struggle for freedom and progressthroughout the world.     In this modern world the tendency towardslarger groups of nations acting together in the common interest leads to greater unity and thus adds to our strength in the struggle forfreedom.     I believe it is both our duty and our interest to contribute towards that strength by securing the closest possible unity withinEurope.    At the same time, if a closer relationship between GreatBritain and the countries of the European Economic Community wereto disrupt the long-standing and historic ties between the UnitedKingdom and the other nations of the Commonwealth the loss would be greater than the gain.     The Commonwealth is a great source of stability and strength both to Western Europe and to the world as awhole, and I am sure that its value is fully appreciated by the member governments of the European Economic Community.    I do not thinkthat Britain&apos;s contribution to the Commonwealth will be reduced ifEurope unites.    On the contrary, I think its value will be enhanced.3.      On the economic side, a community comprising, as members or in association, the countries of Free Europe, could have a very rapidly expanding economy supplying, as eventually it would, a singlemarket of approaching 300 million people.     This would bring thebenefit - crucial in the modern world - of economies of a scale whichwould stimulate efficiency and competitive power.     This rapidly expanding economy could in turn lead to increased demand for the products of other parts of the world and so help to expand world tradeand improve the prospects of the less developed areas of the world.4.      No British Government could join the European economic community without prior negotiation with a view to meetingthe needs of the Commonwealth countries, of our European Free trade association partners, and of British agriculture consistently with the broad principles and purpose which have inspired the concept ofEuropean unity and which are embodied in the Rome Treaty.5.     As the House knows, Ministers have recently visited Common-wealth countries to discuss the problems which would arise if theBritish Government decided to negotiate for membership of the-1-SICHET
European Economic Community.     We have explained to commonwealth governments the broad political and economic considerations which wehave to take into account.     They for their part told us their views andin some cases their anxieties   about their essential interests.    We haveassured Commonwealth Governments that we shall keep in close consultation with them throughout any negotiations which might takeplace.    Secondly, there is the European Free Trade Association.We have treaty and other obligations to our partners in this association and my right hon. Friends have just returned from a meeting of theEuropean Free Trade Association Ministerial Coimcil in Geneva whereall were agreed that they should co-ordinate their actions and remainunited in negotiation.    Finally, we are determined to continue to protect the standard of living of our agricultural community.6.      During the past nine months, we have had exploratory talks with the European Economic Community Governments.     These havebeen very useful and have carried us as far as such informal talks can.We have reached the stage where we cannot make further progresswithout entering into formal negotiations.     I believe that the greatmajority in the House and in the country will feel that they cannot fairlyjudge whether it is possible for the United Kingdom to join the european economic Community until there is a clearer picture before them ofthe conditions on which we could join and the extent to which these would meet our special needs.    Article 237 of the Treaty of Romeenvisages that the conditions of admission of a new member and the amendments of the Treaty necessitated thereby should be the subject ofan agreement between the members and applicant State.     Negotiationsmust therefore be held in order to establish the conditions on whichwe might join.    And in order to enter into these negotiations it isnecessary under the Treaty to make formal application to join theCommunity, although the ultimate decision whether to join or not must depend on the result of the negotiations.     Therefore, after long andearnest consideration, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have come to theconclusion that it would be right for Britain to make a formal applica-tion under Article 237 of the Treaty for negotiations with a view tojoining the Community if satisfactory arrangements can be made tomeet the special needs of the United Kingdom, of the commonwealth and of the European Free Trade Association.7.      If, as I earnestly hope, our offer to enter into negotiations withthe European Economic Community is accepted we shall spare noefforts to reach a satisfactory agreement.     These negotiations must inevitably be of a detailed and technical character covering a verylarge number of the most delicate and difficult matters.     They may therefore be protracted and there can of course be no guarantee ofsuccess.     If negotiations are brought to a conclusion then it will bethe duty of the Governme nt to recommend to the House what course vieshould pursue.     No agreement will be entered into until it it has beenapproved by the House after full consultation with other commonwealth countries.-2-SEGiRET
ANNEX BREVISED DRAFT MOTION FOR THE DEBATEOOHECOMMON MARKET        &quot;That this House supports the decision of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to make formal application under Article 237 of theTreaty of Rome in order to initiate negotiations to see if satisfactory arrangements can be made to meet the special interests of theUnited Kingdom, of the Commonwealth and of the European free trade Association;   and further accepts the undertaking of her majesty&apos;s Government that no agreement affecting these special interests or involving British sovereignty will be entered intountil it has been approved by this House after full consultation withother Commonwealth countries.
