(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 125 COPY NO. &apos;&quot;\)31st July, 1961CABINETDEMONSTRATION IN TRAFALGAR SQUAREBY  NUCLEAR DISARMERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome department the &quot;Committee of 100&quot; have asked the Minister, of Works for permission to use Trafalgar Square on Sunday, 17th September, for a demonstration.   I understand that they propose on that occasion to organisea march on Parliament Square, together with some subsidiary processions,with instructions to those taking part to sit in the road when challenged by the police.2.        My colleagues will remember that a similar demonstration was organised last April.   Some hundreds of demonstrators   who sat down in whitehall had to be arrested and brought before the courts.3.        The written consent of the Minister of Works is required for anyassembly, parade or procession in Trafalgar Square.   When permissionwas sought for the meeting in April, the Minister of Works decided,after consultation with me, that on balance there was insufficient evidence to withhold consent.   We felt that refusal would be likely to cause con-troversy about interfering with the traditional rights of freedom of assembly and freedom of speech, and we had only limited information about the intentions of the organisers.   But we now have the experience of what happened in April, when breaches of the law were committed on a massive scale.There&apos;.&apos;is no doubt that the demonstration now planned for September hasa similar intention, and that the organisers, with the experience theygained last time, could make matters even more difficult for the police.4.        The Minister of Works agrees with me that it would be right,therefore, to refuse the present application.   To give consent would beto connive at an arrangement deliberately designed to flout the criminal law.5.        It is a long time since consent was refused for a political meeting in Trafalgar Square (except on the ground that a previous booking for the square had been made), and in view of the likelihood of public controversythe Minister and I think it right to mention the matter to the Cabinet.6.        The withholding of consent would not put an end to the problemsof the police.   We shall have to see what information accumulates aboutthe intentions of the organisers, but my colleagues ought, I think, to be aware of the following possible developments.-1-
(a) This demonstration is planned for Battle of Britain Sunday, andthe Royal Air Force Association is already planning a march on a routewhich includes Parliament Square and the Horse Guards Arch.   To avoidserious public disorder, it may be necessary for me to approve an Orderby the Commissioner of Police under the Public Order Act, 1936, banningany processions in this area on this day except for that organised by theAssociation.(b) I may have to ask the Minister of Works to consider closing the square altogether.   But this cannot be settled until much nearer the time,as we gain more detailed information about the plans of the organisers.(c) It may be necessary for the Commissioner to consider actionin the courts apainst the ringleaders - for incitement to commitbreaches of the peace, if enough evidence can be obtained;   or an applicationfc r a High Court injunction against them;   or an application to amagistrate unaer an Act of 1361 requiring them to snow cause why theyshould not be bound over to keep thepeace.   This will have to be handledcarefully, as we do not want to give the organisers the chance of represen-ting that they are martyrs.   The Commissioner of Police is consulting the Director of Public Prosecutions on this, and the Attorney-general will be kept in touch.7.        The only immediate question to settle is whether permissionshould be given to the &quot;Committee of 100&quot; for the use of Trafalgar Squareon 17th September,   I hope my colleagues will agree that the Ministerof Works should refuse.R.
