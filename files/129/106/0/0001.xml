annex draft STATEMENTMr, Speaker,With your permission, and that of the House, I should like tomake a statement on Post Office tariffs.The last general increase in P-*st Office tariffs took place in1957.   Since then, despite some wage and price   increases, the Post office has been able to earn a return on capital of about 8 per cent.   Theadditional costs in the past two years were, however, relatively small,and in that period there was an unprecedented increase in business.In the present financial year wages rates and prices have risensharply and they amount to  25 millions.   While I expect to absorb about 10 millions of these additional costs, the effect of these increases onthe Post Office surplus is bound to be substantial.   In order to restore the return on capital to a reasonable figure I need to raise an additional 25 millions in a full year.   I intend to raise  16^ millions from the telecommunications services and  8j millions from the postal services.The price increases on. which I have decided apply either to services running at a loss, or to service which produce an inadequatereturn on capital and where there is a high investment demand.The principal increases are:-Telephones(a) Rentals for telephone exchange lines will be increased by 2 per annum.(b) Connection charges for exchange lines will be doubled.(c) Rentals for private switchboards, extensions and private circuitswill be increased.I propose also to change the basis of charging for telephonesmore than three miles from the exchange.   The excess mileage rentalwill be abolished, but for new subscribers there will be an increasedinitial connection charge related to distance and new construction.Inland Postage(a) The basic printed paper rate will be increased from 2d. to 2^-d. ,but at the same time I am proposing to introduce rebates for large users.(b) The basic charge for newspapers will be increased from 2^d. to3d.(c) The charges for parcels will be increased by 6d. at all points.Details of the changes will be circulated in the Official Report.-2-
Increases in connection charges, the abolition of the excessmileage rental, and two other minor changes will take effect as from.   The remaining telephone changes will become operative on1st November.   The Postal changes will take effect on 1st October.These proposals are consistent with the aims of putting the finances of the nationalised industries on a proper basis and of reducingborrowing from the Exchequer.ruly, 1961-3-
