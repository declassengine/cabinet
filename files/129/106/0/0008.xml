THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.    July 1961C. (61) 10819th July, 1961CABINETVISIT TO CYPRUS, 8th 11th JULYMemorandum by the Lord Privy SealGeneralI spent Monday, 10th July, in Nicosia discussing with President Makarios,Vice-President Kutchuk and members of the Cyprus Government the future UnitedKingdom relationship with the European Economic Community (E.E.C.). Thegeneral talks lasted three hours in the morning and two hours in the evening; inthe afternoon there were separate exchanges between officials. There was a pleasantatmosphere throughout the talks.The Cyprus Governments Attitude2. After I had explained the views of the United Kingdom Government,Archbishop Makarios and the Minister of Commerce both made statements. it immediately emerged from these that the Cyprus Government had already reachedfirm conclusions on the matter which can be briefly summarised as follows:(i) They believed that for the United Kingdom to join the E.E.C. would weaken the political and economic cohesion of the Commonwealthwhich they would deplore.(ii) They could see no way in which their essential agricultural interests couldbe protected other than by the present preferences they receive in theUnited Kingdom. They therefore believed that for the United kingdom to join the E.E.C. would do them very grave damage.(iii) As they had only joined the Commonwealth, against internal politicalopposition, for economic reasons, any diminution in preferences would leave the Cyprus Government politically exposed as well as economicallydamaged.(iv) The consequences of these political and economic changes would be toincrease support for the Communist Party in the island, now numberingbetween 30-40 per cent, of the electorate, which already has greatinfluence in the towns and is now campaigning in the agricultural areas.(v) For these reasons the Cyprus Government was opposed to the UnitedKingdom signing the Treaty of Rome.3. The members of the Government obviously wished to stand on this positionand not to consider any other arrangements. They appeared not to be influenced by any of the alternative economic suggestions put to them and not to set greatstore on the possibilities of assistance by the European Investment Bank. I askedthem, however, to look into all the matters we had put before them and I am quite certain that they are now doing so.Communique4. I encountered considerable difficulty with Archbishop Makarios over the wording of the communique, but I was finally able to persuade him not to expresshis opposition formally in it. I read over to the Archbishop and the Foreign MinisterCopy No. 5859344
the letter I was proposing to send him when I left, indicating that I was sure thathe would understand our reasons if we decided to enter into negotiation with theE.E.C. He acceptedjhis without question.Documents5. I attach a fuller report of the conversations at Annex A, together with acopy;of the communique at Annex B and the letter I left with Archbishop Makariosat&apos;annex.General6. I was glad to find that relations between the Government of Cyprus andthe Administration in the sovereign base areas are good and that the morale of our forces in the bases is extremely high. The Government of Cyprus is facinga number of difficulties, including some problems still outstanding between theGreek and Turkish Cypriots. The political future of the island remains far fromclear.E. H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,18th July. 1961.ANNEX ASUMMARY OF TALKS WITH CYPRUS ministers in my talks with the Cyprus Government I began by explaining why we considered that we must look seriously at the possibility of joining the E.E.C., andof entering into a negotiation with this in view. The Cyprus Ministers declaredroundly that, if we were to do so, Cyprus exports to the United Kingdom whichconsisted mainly of fruit, vegetables and wine and are worth about  5 millions perannum would suffer severely. Their products could not survive in the UnitedKingdom market in competition with those of the e.c. countries unless theyenjoyed not only free entry, but also preferential treatment at about the present level. They therefore expressed the strong view that Britain should not enter theE.E.C. They added that Cyprus had decided to enter the Commonwealthprincipally because of the economic advantages which she gained thereby. without saying so in so many words they implied that, if they were to lose their preferences,there would be little reason for them to stay in the Commonwealth.2. I then repeated that it was not our intention to allow Britain&apos;s entry intothe E.E.C. to damage the essential interests of the Commonwealth. We had made it clear that we could only contemplate entering the E.E.C. if our commonwealth and other essential interests were safeguarded. We believed that only by entering into a negotiation with the E.E.C. were we likely to discover how these interestscould be safeguarded. The Cyprus Ministers took the line that they could see no way in which the preferences they enjoyed could be maintained withoutinfringing the terms of the Treaty of Rome. They therefore concluded that it wouldbe contrary to their interests for the United Kingdom to enter the E.E.C. I repeated that it seemed to us that only by entering into a negotiation could we find outwhether they were right. I suggested that it might be possible for Cyprus tonegotiate some form of association with the e.c. as Greece had done. Thiswould mean that they would have the advantage of expanded markets in europe and would benefit from the funds of the European Investment Bank. Such funds would help them to diversify their industry and make their agricultural productionmore efficient. They seemed doubtful whether they would be able to achievemuch; my feeling is that they are over pessimistic about their prospects and I said so.3. In the end they accepted that only by entering into negotiations could we see if their essential interests could be safeguarded. They nevertheless remainedprofoundly sceptical of the chances of our being able to help them.
Foreign Office, S.W.I,July, 1961.ANNEX BCOMMUNIQUE ON TALKS IN NICOSIAThe President of the Republic of Cyprus, the Vice-President and Ministers ofthe Cyprus Government had talks to-day with Mr. Edward Heath, Lord privy seal an the United Kingdom Government, about the implications of any Britishmove to negotiate for entry into the E.E.C. Mr. Heath said that the UnitedKingdom Government had always made it plain that they would seek to safeguard the vital interests of Commonwealth countries in any arrangement which mightbe made with ithe E.E.C.; this would, of course, be their object in the case of cyprus. The United Kingdom Government had not decided whether to enterinto negotiations and would not do so until they had been able to consider theviews expressed -by all the Commonwealth Governments, during the present seriesof visits by United Kingdom Ministers.The political and economic aspects of possible British membership of thecommunity were explored and the advantages and disadvantages that might arise,with particular reference to Cyprus, were considered. The Government of Cyprusexpressed the fear that if the United Kingdom were to join the E.E.C. the Cyprusexport trade would suffer severely. The Cyprus Government asked that in any negotiations with the E.E.C. the British Government should seek to safeguard the continued privileged access of Cyprus products to the United Kingdom market.The Lord Privy Seal assured the Cyprus Government that their views would begiven full weight in any negotiations with the E.E.C. with a view to safeguardingthese vital interests of Cyprus.It was agreed that the United Kingdom Government and the Government of cyprus would continue to keep in close touch with each other on this subject.Mr. Heath will report- -fully on these discussions to the United KingdomGovernment on his return to London.4. When we came to set the position down on paper in a communique^ the cyprus Government Ministers proved extremely difficult. They wanted anunequivocal statement that Britain&apos;s entry into the Common Market would entailsevere damage to Cyprus&apos; export trade. I refused to accept this since I had made it quite clear that we were only contemplating entry if we could obtain safeguards for the essential interests of the Commonwealth and our other partners, as wellas on agriculture. Such a sentence as they had proposed would be quoted against us out of context as showing that we were contemplating entry into the E.E.C.without any safeguards. In the end I insisted on spelling out our position, atthe start of the communique (Annex B), so that their sentence coming later oncould only be read in conjunction with it.5. I also had to insist on the exclusion of a sentence expressing the viewthat Britain should not enter the E.E.C. I explained that this would constituteinterference in the internal affairs of another member of the Commonwealth. this they accepted.6. To sum up, the Cyprus Government have a real problem and to themit looms very large. In the wider context it is clearly of less magnitude. Havingnow discussed the Greek agreement of association with the E.E.C. with MonsieurAveroff, the Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs, I think that some at least of cyprus&apos; preoccupations might be met as Greece&apos;s have been. Failing that, it maybe necessary to provide some form of economic compensation for loss ofpreference. The sum involved would not, I believe, be very large. But that is taking matters a good deal further than is necessary for the present.E. H.
Office of the High Commissionerfor the United Kingdom,Alexander Pallis Street,Nicosia, 11th July, 1961.Your Beatitude,I am most grateful for the opportunity I have had to discuss with yourBeatitude and Ministers of your Government the problem of the EuropeanCommon Market.I hope that I have been able to explain the reasons which have led us to thinkthat we should consider entering into formal negotiations with the Six.As I have emphasised, the British Government themselves have not yet reached a decision on this question, and we shall not do so until we have completed ourconsultations with all Commonwealth Governments, and have considered theirviews.It seems to us that it would not be possible to make any detailed assessment of the effects upon individual Commonwealth countries of Britain joining theGommunity until it can be seen how far their various interests could be protected.You have of course made plain that you attach the greatest importance to themaintenance of a privileged position for Cyprus exports to the United Kingdom.As I have explained, we can only ascertain how the interests of the Commonwealthcan best be protected through the process of negotiation with the E.E.C.If, therefore, after considering the views of Commonwealth Governments, theBritish Government should come to the conclusion that it was desirable to open negotiations with the Six with a view to ascertaining what special terms could beobtained, I am sure that, in the light of our discussions, you will understand our reasons for doing so. I can, of course, assure you that in any such negotiationswe would throughout keep in the closest touch with you, and that before any finaldecision were taken, there would be the fullest consultation between us.Yours sincerely,EDWARD HEATH.His Beatitude Archbishop Makarios,President of the Republic of Cyprus,Nicosia.ANNEX C
