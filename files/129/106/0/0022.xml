CONFIDENTIAL; . 147(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 12229th July, 1961CABINETTRADE WITH POLANDMemorandum by the Lord President ofthe Council and Minister for science the Economic Policy Committee have discussed a proposal by thePresident of the Board of Trade that we should conclude an arrangement with the Poles under which they would buy certain additional capital goods from the United Kingdom in return for an opportunity to sell us more bacon and canned ham.2.      The Poles have indicated their willingness to buy three ships, on :the usual credit terms, if possible in Northern Ireland and Scotland, at atotal cost of about  3 millions, and about  1 million of heavy motor vehicles, which,   together with the financing costs, would amount to atotal of  5 millions.   In return they would want an additional quota of3, 000 tons of bacon (worth  600, 000 -  700, 000 per annum) and anadditional quota of  200, 000 worth of canned ham over and above the quotasalready fixed in the annual trade agreement of 48, 500 tons of bacon and 1. 7 millions for canned ham.     They would also expect that these increasedquotas would be continued for several years, as necessary, to liquidatethe cost of the ships and trucks.Arguments in favour of the arrangement3.      There are strong commercial grounds for agreeing to thisarrangement.   Poland would be a new market for ships and lorries, whichthey would not otherwise purchase, and once we got a foothold therewe might well succeed in expanding our trade in these goods.   Moreover,much needed work might be brought to the shipywards of Northern Irelandand Scotland.   The additional quota for bacon would amount to less than per cent of our domestic consumption.   There would be no automaticpurchase on our side, since the Poles would have to sell their baconrincompetition with other suppliers and over a tariff barrier of 10 per cent(which does not apply to Denmark and the Irish Republic).   Since most ofour bacon and canned ham is imported, additional imports from poland would tend to displace other imports rather than our domestic production.The whole deal should therefore produce a substantial gain to our balanceof payments.   Finally, we should not lose sight of the political importanceof extending our trade with Poland as a means of weaning her away fromthe Soviet bloc.   Acceptance of this arrangement would do much to restore confidence in the future of Anglo-Folisy trade which was damaged by our action in 1959 in cutting the bacon quotas for the following trade year.-1-COPY NO.
Arguments against the arrangement4.      The Minister of Agriculture is prepared to agree that the quotas for bacon and canned ham should be increased by the amounts proposed for the current quota year only, if by doing so we can secure contracts for ships and heavy vehicles from the Poles.   He cannot, however, agreeto a continuing commitment which might last six or seven years.   both home-produced bacon and imports from Denmark are likely to rise.   Theincreased Polish quotas that we would be asked to guarantee would represent about 9 per cent of current consumption of each of these twocommodities.   We are already making representations to the Danes aboutthe increase in their pig breeding herd.   In these circumstances it would bedifficult to justify any long-term guarantees to the Poles, especially inview of the repercussions on our other suppliers.   Moreover, a long-term commitment of this kind would present us with special difficultiesat a time when we might become involved in negotiations with the Sixabout a common agricultural policy.   In the view of the Minister ofAgriculture British pigmeat producers would be extremely disturbed bya guarantee of the kind proposed, which would also set a precedent forother possible deals involving agricultural and horticultural products.5.      If the Cabinet decide that a deal on these lines can be authorised,the Minister of Aviation thinks that there is a strong case for asking thePoles again whether they would agree to include aircraft in their purchaseof our capital goods.   Although the President of the Board of Trade was told byPolish Ministers in June that they were not yet ready to buyBritish aircraft, officials of the Polish Airline have recently shown a renewed interest in doing so.   An entry into the Polish market would have great importance for our aircraft industry and lead to further sales of spare parts, etc.   The Minister of Aviation has therefore suggested thatthe deal should not be concluded until the attitude of the Polish government towards  buying our aircraft has been clarified.6.      The Economic Policy Committee recognised the importanceof developing our trade with Poland, but felt unable to reach a conclusion on the President&apos;s proposal in view of the objection of the Minister ofAgriculture.   As Acting Chairman of the Committee I submit thisquestion to the Cabinet for a decision.HAILSHAM,Office of the Lord Presidentof the Council, S. W. L.28th July, 1961-2-
