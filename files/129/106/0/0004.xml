(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 104 COPY NO.   J Vj18th July, 1961CABINETVISIT TO COMMONWEALTH. CAPITALS IN ASIA,&quot;JUNE/,JULY, 1961Memorandum by the Minister of aviation have had satisfactory talks with the Governments of the fivecountries I visited.     I was well received everywhere and each Governmenthad reviewed their attitude to the problem in advance of my visit and had prepared themselves for effective discussion.2.        The most important conclusion I draw from my conversations isthat none of these five Governments was opposed to our opening negotiationswith the Six.    All of them fully understand the decision is one for us totake and recognise its great importance for us.     They all attach importance to being consulted during any negotiations and the biggercountries at any rate would probably establish special liaison with us.They would all look to an opportunity, which I have promised them, for final consultation when we know what terms we can secure and they can see more clearly how their interests are affected.3.        They are all naturally concerned about the possible consequences to their trade though Malaya has little concern as her stable exports are most unlikely to be affected.    As rubber and tin have, in practice, free entry into the Six as well as into the United Kingdom, the range of commodities on which these Governments are seriously concerned narrowsdown to tea, cotton textiles, jute manufactures and coconut products.This is a sharp reminder of the extremely narrow basis on which theColonies and Asian Commonwealth countries still rest.     The three whichlook to an industrial future, Singapore, Pakistan and India, are also concerned about the possibility that their prospects of developing newexport lines will be seriously worsened if they lose the privilege of free entry into the United Kingdom and if we join with a group of countries whose commercial policies towards Asia have been considerably lessliberal than our own.    As well as the items I have mentioned there area number of smaller items in which they have given us information andon which they will expect us to do what we can for them, but none of these is likely to cause us serious difficulty in the last resort.4.        Their general attitudes to the problem differ somewhat.    pakistan and Malaya take the view that, if in our judgment the United kingdom economy will be strengthened, then it is greatly in their own interests that we should join.     They regard a strong United Kingdom as their own:&apos; . &apos; . .     &apos;-&apos;:&apos;r-        -       .    : &apos;v-1-
paramount concern.     Ceylon and Singapore are, so far at any rate, purelyconcerned with the effect of tariff changes on their own exports.    On theother hand India, while recognising that the judgment is one for us tomake and that a strong United Kingdom economy is of great advantage tothem, expressed misgivings about the effect of our joining on existingCommonwealth links.     The Prime Minister, Mr. Nehru, expressed some anxiety lest the emergence of such a powerful economic and political unionmight retard the industrial advance of the new African countries forexample.    The Minister of Finance, Mr. Morarji Desai, expressedpersonal doubts whether the machinery of Commonwealth economicconsultation and co-operation could really continue if we joined the Six.5.        I found all these countries very much interested in the AssociatedOversea Territory (A. O. T. ) provisions of the Treaty of Rome,     Iemphasised that these arrangements would be re-negotiated before theend of next year and that we should not assume that the existing provisionscould be applied unchanged for Commonwealth countries, but I suggest itmight be possible by analogy to devise some arrangement of a similarkind which would avoid disadvantage and perhaps bring positive advantage to some Commonwealth countries.     I said that we were thinking that something on these lines might be most appropriate for at any rate someof the Colonies.     India, Pakistan and Singapore expressed concern lestby such an arrangement Hong Kong might be put in a more advantageousposition than themselves.     I felt bound to tell them that it was unlikelythat such treatment could be secured for Hong Kong because of herspecial characteristics.    Ceylon and Malaya would be very willing toaccept arrangements on A. O. T. lines which would, of course, protect their interests completely.    Singapore also was attracted by the idea of having a free market for her industrial products once her industrialisationis going ahead.    She would wish also to have the benefit of free tradeinside a &quot;Greater Malayasia&quot; and so get the best of both worlds.Pakistan Ministers accepted that any such arrangement would suit themvery well economically and on these grounds they would like to have it.They said that the political aspects of this would have to be consideredby their Cabinet (President Ayub and the Foreign Secretary were, ofcourse, away at the time of my visit)s    It was clear that they wereattracted to the idea.    On the other hand the Indian Government feelthat a solution on these lines will divide the Commonwealth and clearlythey have some political dislike for the conception and recognise that itwould not be appropriate for them or for the developed commonwealth countries.     The association of some parts of the Commonwealth with europe would give these countries an advantage over India in exports to europe.    They expect also that associated countries will give preferencesto Europe as against the rest of the world.    At the least they would expect that their own preferential position in East Africa and Ceylon,for example, would be lost and they did not see why they should sacrificeit without compensation of some kind.     They recognise that we have an obligation to make the best arrangements we can for the Colonies butthey suggest that, if the problem is one of uncompetitive production ofparticularproducts in the Colonies, we could afford to take care of thisby subsidies.      They also see the possibility of preferences for Europeagainst them in these areas.     It is clearly in their minds to opposedevelopments of this kind in favour of other Commonwealth countries.-2-
6.        The alternative solution proposed by the Indian Government andalso by Indian business and commercial circles is based on commoditiesrather than on countries.    It is suggested that we should take a range of commodities which cover a substantial area of Commonwealth trade withparticular emphasis on the developing Commonwealth countries and colonies and seek to negotiate free entry or very liberal entry for thisrange.    Such an arrangement it is agreed would be less likely to divide the Commonwealth while meeting much of the essential needs for whichA. O. T. status is designed.     There is something in this argument and Iwould argue that it should be given very urgent and detailed study inthe Departments concerned.7.        My conclusions are:-(a) That, so far as the Asian Commonwealth countries areconcerned, we are not only free to negotiate but areexpected to do so.(b) That the final decision must be ours.(c) That, while real anxieties, economical and political,exist in this area, a final judgment on them cannot bemade until negotiations disclose what the resultantsolution may look like.(d) That it is important that, throughout any negotiationswith the Six, we not only consult these commonwealth countries but give every appearance of doing so.P. T.Ministry of Aviation, W. C. 2.17th July, 1961.
