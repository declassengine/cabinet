TOP SECRETI Annex to^LM J.I.C. (61)27 (Final) j^H  I.-THE BITTERNESS OF THE DISPUTE AND THE BAD PERSONALRELATIONS BETWEEN KHRUSHCHEV AND MAO TSE-TUNG^L*M From documents circulated by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union^LWW (CPSU) and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) before the Moscow meeting itcan be seen that relations between the two parties and their leaders had deterioratedduring the years 1956-60 even more seriously than has previously been suspected.2.  A few quotations will suffice to give the bitter tone of the recriminationswMMM on both sides.^LWM 3.  Thus the CPSU describe the CCP as &quot; ardent for war as a game-cock &quot;.^LWM Chinese accusations against the Russians were rated as &quot; unscrupulous inventions &quot;^LWW and &quot; unsubstantiated make-believe from beginning to end&quot;.   With blatant^kWM reference to Mao, Khrushchev said that &quot; An old and insensitive man is like a pair^LWM of worn slippers which should be thrown into a corner&quot;.^LWM 4.  The Chinese directed most of their venom at Khrushchev personally, for^LWW example: &quot; He talks without knowing what he says &quot;; and on his foreign policies:&quot; The declarations of Comrade Khrushchev have in no way impeded the armament^LWM race and prepaftftldli for war. They have succeeded only in creating confusion in^LWW the Communist Movement&quot;.   The Russians were &quot; fearful of irritating theV^XWM imperialists &quot;; they had &quot; organised a world-wide anti-Chinese campaign &quot; and^LWM their attitude was &quot; neither serious nor Marxist&quot;.   Finally, Soviet delegates in^LWW Front Organisations were described by the Chinese as &quot; having become more feeble^LWW than Buddhist monks&quot;.II.-THE WAY THE DISPUTE DEVELOPED5.  Sufficient evidence is now available to enable an authoritative assessment^LWM to be made of the initial causes of the dispute and its subsequent development.^LWm 6.   One general comment is called for by way of introduction. The argumentsK^XWM about ideological matters which appear to be so dominant in the overall dispute,are to some extent the outward and visible sign of much deeper, more practical^LXjm and more irreconcilable divergencies. These include such matters as the Russian^LWW refusal to give the Chinese nuclear weapons, their unwillingness to sacrifice any^LWW Soviet interest for the sake of Formosa, and the competition between Peking and^LWm Moscow for influence in the Satellites. Some of these practical divergencies deriveWXwM of course from a fundamental difference of approach, Peking generally favouringa much more forward line than Moscow. Indeed it becomes difficult at times to^LWM differentiate practical from ideological quarrels or to say which came first-themore so since Communists tend to formulate all questions in theoretical terms,^LWW this being the language of their politics.^L*M 7.  Very briefly the main stages in the development of the dispute seem toWMMMM have been as follows:(a) In 1956 the Chinese objected to the way in which Khrushchev, at the20th Congress of the CPSU, without properly consulting other^k-W Communist Parties, proclaimed de-Stalinisation and the possibility of^k-jm Socialist revolution by peaceful means. This was the starting point of^LWW serious friction.mLWM H      (b) The following autumn the Chinese objected to the timing and nature of^LwM Soviet intervention in Poland and Hungary.^LwM (c) Friction in bilateral relations began to develop in 1956-57 over Soviet^k-W technicians and aid (which the Chinese thought should be applied^k-W mainly to the bloc).  In their turn the Russians disapproved of theChinese liberalising doctrine of the &quot; Hundred Flowers &quot;.TOP SECRET m\\\\\M-wM b 2
TOP SECRET(d) Difficulties in Sino-Soviet military co-operation probably began in 1957when the Russians are thought to have revealed to the Chinese theirintention not to give them nuclear weapons. This may have been oneof the reasons why, according to some reports, the Chinese have atvarious times refused proposals for a submarine base, missile bases andradar detection units in China and reciprocity in the use of airfields inwar time.   They also rejected a Soviet proposal for a joint naval ^command in the Far East. Furthermore, re-equipment of the Chinese Tair forces with more modern Soviet aircraft seems to have made Icomparatively slow progress.(e) The Moscow Conference of November 1957 failed to settle the problemswhich had accumulated during the previous year. Though the Chinesesigned the declaration and tried subsequently to turn it against theRussians, they entered reservations in a secret memorandum.Meanwhile they introduced a new embarrassment in their interpretationof Soviet rocket achievements, which they held to justify a moreadventurous foreign policy without fear of Western retaliation.(/) During the next three years most of the important actions of one sidebecame, sooner or later, the subject of recrimination by the other.These included Chinese pressure on Formosa and the offshore islands;their encouragement of Communist militancy in Iraq; and the Chineseprogrammes of accelerated economic development (The Great Leap)and the &quot; communisation&quot; of agriculture. The Chinese discovered Ithat their Minister of Defence, whom they subsequently degraded foropposing the communes, was in secret communication with the Russiansand they were violently angry at what they regarded as Sovietinterference in their internal affairs. In their turn the Chinese criticised(i) Soviet proposals for a Summit meeting following the Middle Easterncrisis in 1958; (ii) fresh Russian doctrinal innovations on peacefulco-existence and the avoidability of war, introduced by Khrushchevat the 21st Congress of the CPSU in 1959; and (iii) Khrushchev&apos;smoves towards detente with the United States.8. The Russians made repeated suggestions for bilateral talks to settledifferences. But the Chinese, unimpressed by the results of the visits to Pekingof Mikoyan in 1956 and Khrushchev in 1958, and optimistic about their followingin the international movement, stalled on these suggestions and sought a widerforum. Eventually Khrushchev forestalled them by convening an international Iconference at Bucharest in June 1960 where he took them by surprise by distributinga letter dated 21st June which mixed a critical analysis of Chinese mistakes with acareful restatement of the Soviet position. This had visibly toughened since the^^fl failure of the Paris Summit and the document was designed to diminish the forceof Chinese charges of softness. The Conference itself was marked by acrimoniousrecriminations on both sides. A Soviet proposal was, however, accepted to setup a preparatory Commission to pave the way for an international conference tobe held at the time of the Soviet Anniversary Celebrations in Moscow.9. The Chinese looked on the deterioration of relations in the next few monthsas a &quot; crisis &quot;. The Russians withdrew all their technicians from China andsuppressed the distribution of Chinese propaganda within the Soviet Union. Therewas also a bitter exchange of protests about an alleged Chinese violation of theSoviet frontier. Meanwhile, the Russians made a new suggestion for bilateraltalks to which the Chinese did not respond, issuing instead on 10th September ablistering reply to the Soviet letter of 21st June. The Preparatory Commission of26 Communist Parties duly met in Moscow at the end of September. Their progresswas undermined on 5th November by a new Soviet letter which constituted themost violent attack yet on the Chinese positions and reopened fundamental issues.The main conference opened on 10th November against this background to hear Ilengthy speeches from most of the representatives who, by and large, supportedthe Soviet position. The Conference could only ventilate differences, being tooWlarge and mixed to make any contribution to settling them. The drafting commissionappointed for this purpose could not agree on the final version of the Statementuntil Liu Shao-chi had had private discussions with Khrushchev. From theevidence available it is clear that the Chinese had reservations about the finalStatement and only signed in the interest of unity.TOP SECRET
TOP SECRET^LM III.-THE ISSUES IN DISPUTE AND THE OUTCOME OF THE MOSCOWCONFERENCE^LWM 10.   Comparing the secret material available to us with the text of the ^LwM^LMM Moscow statement and the subsequent Soviet and Chinese pronouncements, it is ^LwMKW- possible to reach a definitive view on the precise nature of the differences on ^LwM^LMM        A matters of principle between Peking and Moscow, and on how far one side or the ^LwM^LMM other can be said to have gained at the Moscow meeting.  Although it is true wkwM^LMM that the final declaration was mainly a papering over of the cracks, it appears that ^LMMwkwM m t]je course of the dispute each side modified its position on many of the issues. WLwM^LMM No less striking have been the changes in policy which have taken place since the ^LMM^LMM time of the Moscow meeting, particularly on the part of the Soviets. ^LMMWkwM ii   From the evidence we have, it is clear that both sides considered that the wXwM^LMM parting of the ways began with their disparate definitions of the &quot; character of the wkwM^LMM present epoch &quot;.  The Chinese consider it to be an age of imperialist aggression ^LMMW^mt and of revolution; the Russians an age of imperialist disintegration in which the W^mt^LMM Socialist countries are rapidly achieving world predominance. The Chinese appear ^LMM^LMM to have argued, from Lenin, that in an age of imperialist aggression Communists m\w\W^mt must act militarily and prepare for war. The Russians argue that the situation has m^mt^LMM changed since Lenin&apos;s day, that Lenin&apos;s advice must consequently be modified and^LMM that, since imperialism is disintegrating the bloc may rely less on war and more onWXwM peaceful methods such as economic competition.  Another important theoretical WXWM^LMM difference was whether Communist revolution could be achieved peacefully. The^LMM Chinese had been deeply offended in 1956 when Khrushchev, without consultingmmwrn them, propounded his doctrine of the peaceful transition to Socialism. . Although WLwM^LMM the Moscow Statement included an agreed formula on the subject, there are secret^mmji indications that the Chinese are thoroughly dissatisfied with it, and the issue maymXWA easily be reopened. WkWM^Ww\ 12.  Apart from these theoretical questions the main issues in the disputeWXWM fell into three categories: MlwM^LWM (A) East-West relations. ^LwMwLwM (B) Relations with the uncommitted countries. wLwM^LwM (C) Control of the International Communist movement. ^LwM(A) East-West RelationsWA9M 13,  Under this heading debates took place on &quot; peaceful co-existence &quot;, the UAwM^LMM &quot; non-inevitability of war&quot; and disarmament.WXwM 14.  Peaceful Co-existence.-The theory of peaceful co-existence dates from wkwM^LMM the early days of the Soviet revolution and has been generally accepted byWlwM Communists, of all parties, though the emphasis has varied from time to time. EwM^LMM Lenin regarded it purely as a tactic of expediency whilst the Communist world^LMM gathered strength-more or less the present Chinese line-whilst Khrushchev has ^LwM^LMM defined it as a state of intense political, economic and ideological struggle, stopping WLwM^mmm- short of war.^LMM 15.  The Chinese have never opposed the doctrine.   Indeed, they regard WXwM^LMM themselves as having made a substantial contribution to it. But they are even more mfMwkwM cynical about it than the Russians.  Peaceful co-existence for the Chinese means WxwM^LMM a continuing all-out toughness in anticipation of possible war, with no belief in theM\wM virtues of detente except as a means of tricking the enemy.  Indeed, the cause of \WM^LMM much of the extremely violent Chinese criticism of Khrushchev is their view that wXWMKW- he has not been nearly opportunist enough in his exploitation of peaceful ^LMM^LMM co-existence. Most important of all they have objected to the way he has applied ^LwM^LMM the principle. To them it was quite unacceptable, for instance, that Khrushchev ^LMM^LMM should say of the United States President that he was a man of peace. Indeed, the WxwM^LMM           twist in Soviet tactics involving fraternising with Western leaders, from the autumn ^LMM^LMM of 1959, when Khrushchev visited the United States, till the summer of 1960, was wkwM%W- totally abhorrent to the Chinese, and could not, in their opinion, be justified under ^LMM^LMM the heading of peaceful co-existence. Peking&apos;s undeviating hostility to the United WxwM%W- States no doubt lies at the root of much of their thinking on this subject, which ^LMM^LMM becomes translated of course into customary doctrinal language. WkWMTOP SECRETI I&apos;M
^mmmmmmmmmummmmmmmmmummmmYMi TOP SECRET^Lwm 16. In the course of the past year it has been possible to perceive a shift in ^L-M^-m               the Soviet line which almost certainly owes something to the Sino-Soviet disputewM-M               as well as to other factors in the international situation. At the 21st Party Congress -mjm^-M               in 1959 Khrushchev, in talking about peaceful co-operation, placed most of his ^Lw\^L-W.               emphasis on the need for co-operation between all countries, the easing of ^L-M^-m international tension and the strengthening of mutual understanding. But in recent ^L-WwMWM               months these themes have occupied less space in Soviet propaganda and public f   ? wM\Mstatements and the element of struggle in peaceful co-existence has been stressed ^Lm\^L-m               more noticeably and frequently. There are two obvious reasons for this change^-M               in Soviet aims:^Lw\                     (a) Their growing confidence that the world Socialist system is outstripping the ^--Mcapitalist one. This is shown very clearly in the Moscow statement of^L-M                             December 1960, which proclaims &quot; that the world Socialist system&quot; ^L-Wis becoming &quot; the decisive factor in the development of society &quot; and ^L-m^L-m                             that the imperialists can no longer stop its advance. ^Lm\^Lw\                      (b) Their conviction that the nuclear stalemate can be turned to their advantage ^--M^-m                             since it paralyses the West&apos;s capacity to resist &quot; national liberation ^L-mwMWM                             movements &quot;. This is illustrated in Khrushchev&apos;s speech of 6th January, wMWM^L-m commenting on the Moscow statement. Peaceful co-existence is meantonly to prevent wars between sovereign States; it cannot and should^L-m not prevent civil wars &quot; or wars of liberation &quot;, which CommunistswMWM must support, comfortable in the knowledge that the West will be WMWM^L-W                             deterred frdgta intervening out of fear of touching off a general nuclearwar. The risk of escalation is not mentioned in connexion with these^L-m                             national liberation wars. ^L-W^Lw\                     17.  This changed attitude is spelt out frankly in Khrushchev&apos;s broadcast of ^L-M^L%W 15th June, 1961, on the Vienna meeting with President Kennedy. He admits that^LWm               he and President Kennedy mean different things by peaceful co-existence.  The ^L-mwMWM               struggle, he says, between the oppressed and the exploiters cannot be &quot; regulated WMWM^L%W by agreement &quot;. &quot; He who would like to reach agreement on this question &quot;, assertsKhrushchev, &quot; shows that he does not understand history, does not understand thelaw of development of society&quot;. ^L-m^L-m 18.  In the arena of peaceful co-existence, therefore, we may already perceivein the course of the dispute a distinct hardening in the Soviet line.M^M                     19.  Non-inevitability of War.-The Chinese thought that they were on good M^LWground in attacking Khrushchev&apos;s doctrine of the non-inevitability of war which, ^Lm\^L-m               they said, ruled out the possibility even of revolutionary war. But it is clear that,^L-W               contrary to the general belief, the Chinese never maintained throughout the yearsof their dispute that war between States was inevitable, i.e., global war. They rated ^^fllower than did the Russians, however, the possibility of averting war and wanted ^L%Wmore emphasis on the importance of civil war and wars of national liberation.They also thought that the threat of nuclear war should be held out so as to ^Lmgintimidate the imperialists, and that to emphasise its dangers for the Communist        I Mjmmworld was likely to undermine the latter&apos;s resistance. Finally they thought that in ^L%Wany case the Communist bloc would emerge with advantage from a nuclear war.Mjmm 20.  It was never on the cards that Khrushchev would be constrained by the ^^flChinese into modifying his fundamental belief that:(a) nuclear war could and should be avoided, and(b) that it was expedient for the bloc to proclaim this.21. But he does appear to have modified his line in one important respect.This was in the sense of clarifying and enunciating Soviet ideas on &quot; local wars &quot;(begun by imperialists) which must be nipped in the bud and &quot; liberation wars &quot; Emm(begun by revolutionary forces), which Communists must support (see referenceto Khrushchev&apos;s speech of 6th January in paragraph 16 (b) above). q ^Mmi22. Disarmament.-The Chinese declared that the Soviet call for totaldisarmament was a danger to the fighting spirit of the anti-imperialist forces. MuchI to Soviet annoyance they cast doubt on Soviet sincerity in putting forward theirproposals saying that they were nothing but a diplomatic manoeuvre.  While notabandoning the ideal of total disarmament as an ultimate goal the Russians Ii TOP SECRET i
i TOP SECRETcompromised with the Chinese view on partial measures and admitted that they did^f^ft not aim to abolish all weapons and armed forces immediately but deprive theWWW West of instruments for colonial domination.  In detailed reply to the Chinese ^f^ft^f^ft they emphasised both the political motivation and the serious advantages of their^f^ft intentions. Their disarmament campaign, they argued, genuinely helped to preservepeace &quot; it was not a diplomatic manoeuvre but a serious political asset in the interestsof the world Socialist system &quot;; it applied pressure for liquidating hostile militarybases; it was useful in the struggle against hostile blocs and pacts; it facilitated the# destruction of colonialism (since if they were successful in disarming the Great ^k^k\^f^ft Powers who possessed modern weapons national liberation would be easilyachieved).  Most important, public opinion could compel their enemies to acceptWWW disarmament; it was of manifest importance for propaganda and for unifying the WWWmasses, and they could not allow their enemies to outbid them.23. Since the time of the Moscow meeting there appears to have been achange in the Soviet attitude towards both the nuclear test talks at Geneva andV-WW disarmament in general. The Russians have made plain that they are not interested ^^fl^f^ft in a test ban agreement, except on their own terms, which require acceptance of^f^fi the troika, which they must know is unacceptable, and may therefore haveinserted deliberately to block the prospects of agreement. They have also postulatedthat agreement should not be made in isolation from disarmament.  From theirrecent behaviour over disarmament it also looks as if they no longer believe what ^^fl^f^fi they were suggesting to the Chinese last year that there is a basis for negotiating ^f^faan agreement on this subject which might be in the interests-albeit differentinterests-of both East and West.  Present Russian tactics suggest that they areWWW n t currently interested in serious negotiation either on disarmament or tests.^f^fi There are probably several motives for this change, but Moscow&apos;s inability tobring the Chinese along with them on these subjects and Peking&apos;s hostility tothe previous Soviet views may have some relevance.(B) Relations with the Uncommitted Countries24. The dispute over relations with the uncommitted countries centred onthe grand strategy for promoting revolution, the Chinese urging Communistmilitancy everywhere, the Russians the virtues of moderate tactics. Directcompetition for influence was only a minor aspect of the quarrel.25. The Chinese argued that the national bourgeoisies in these areas were^f^ft allying themselves increasingly with imperialism even to the extent of persecutingWWW            Communists and that the resources used for the construction of projects like theAswan Dam and power stations in India could be deployed more profitably within^f^fi the bloc or in the interest of promoting revolution.  The Russians retorted byquoting Lenin on the skilful use of rifts... &quot; Always secure the help of an ally nomatter how temporary, vacillating, unstable, unreliable and conditional&quot;. . . .^f^fi Khrushchev returned the Chinese fire by blaming them for the harm they haddone to Communism in Iraq, India and elsewhere (while at the same timeemphasising the transience of Soviet solidarity with the Indian Government). He^f^fi instanced Soviet support for revolutions and aid for under-developed countries.26. Part of the quarrel about neutralism was fought out at international^f^ft Communist front meetings. Here also they had accused the Russians of trying to^f^fi force international Communist activity to fit their diplomacy and, on occasion,^f^ft even of opposing the struggle for national independence. Little compromise was^t^t*           possible on this question although the Russian view that the main task ofCommunists was to attract mass support by reasonableness and flexible tacticsreceived the support of the great majority at the Moscow conference.27. Since the meeting the main developments have been:(a) signs that the Chinese, for all their doctrinal intransigence, do not want tolose ground to the Russians in the field of economic aid to South-East^f^fi Asia;       (b) indications that the Chinese wish in the current year to express themselvesas a reasonable and mature Great Power for uncommitted opinion,^f^M both to make up the ground lost recently, particularly over Tibet and^f^M Indonesia, and thereby to rally support for their admission to the United^f^fi Nations;H I TOP SECRET &apos;v
TOP SECRET(c) evident eagerness on the part of the Russians to show that they are quite WLWM^mmmm                             prepared to criticise rigorously Iraq and the U.A.R. for persecuting ^k-W^LXwM                             Communists; ^LmW^-\mm\ {d) continued disparity towards Africa; the Chinese, but not the Russians, ^kwM^k\\\\                             having diplomatic relations with the FLN and Gizenga for instance,and Peking paying more attention than Moscow to Left opposition ^Lmmelements.\\\m H(C) Control of the International Communist Movement ^L*M^kmjM                     28.  Already in 1959 the Russians had insisted that they should not be referred ^LwMto as &quot; leaders &quot; of the Communist camp.  Paradoxically, the Chinese, far from ^kmm^LmmW               objecting to the leadership formula, took the initiative in putting it forward, possibly ^kmm^LmmW               for the reason, as some foreign Communists thought, that they hoped eventually Wk^MM^LmmW               to step into Soviet shoes. But they complained that in fact (and with some justice) ^LWW^LXwM               the Russians were improperly trying to impose their views on other parties and ^kmmwMMMM               challenged this in three ways. First, they demanded that other parties should be wMMM^LmWM               effectively consulted before the Russians introduced any major innovation of policy ^Lmm^LmmW               or theory (i.e., they wished for a veto on Soviet freedom of action).  Second, they ^Lmminsisted on the equality of all parties and refused absolutely to accept any idea ^^flof a majority ruling. Third, they maintained that they had the right to persist in ^kmm^LmmW               their views and recruit support for them and resisted all Russian efforts to condemn ^Lmm^LmWM               this in the final declaration under the heading of &quot; fractional activity &quot;. This they ^LWW^Hfl               said, &quot; would be designed to put a bomb under the Chinese leaders &quot;. ^LmW^LmWm                     29.  Framed in these terms the question of the balance of power in the ^LmWCommunist movement proved the most intractable of all the questions in the mmmWM^LmWm               dispute and was only settled after the private meeting between Khrushchev and ^LmwmLiu Shao-chi which led the Chinese to agree with some reluctance to sign the ^LmW^LmwM               statement.  The Russians yielded to Chinese objections to the use of the word ^LmW^LmwM               &quot; fractionalism &quot; and compromised with a call for &quot; the prevention of any action ^Lmwm^LmWm               which may undermine unity &quot;, a phrase which clearly subsumes fractionalism. In ^Lmwm^LmWm               order to reduce the danger of a repetition of Chinese public attacks on Soviet policy ^LmmfWk^kyM               and Chinese lobbying of other Communist Parties, the statement lays down that Wk^gMcriticisms of a brother party must be discussed bilaterally before being referred to ^LmW^LXjM               a wider meeting.   This very important provision did not occur in the 1957 ^LmW^LmwM               Statement.  The 1960 Statement calls for solidarity in observing the conclusions ^LmWjointly reached by fraternal parties at their meetings.   Not surprisingly, the ^LmWstatement did not explicitly enjoin other parties to observe the decisions of CPSU ^LmW^LmwM               Congresses. Nevertheless it stressed the value of CPSU experience as an example WMMMMfor the whole movement. The statement also omitted 1957&apos;s approving reference ^LmWto the results of the Congresses of the Chinese Communist Party and denounced ^LmWdogmatism (in this context aimed at China) much more sharply than in 1957. ^LmW30. On paper therefore the CPSU has gone some way towards preventing a ^LmW^k-wM               recurrence of open dispute in the Communist movement. On the other hand, the ^LmWeffect of the open Chinese defiance and criticism of the CPSU must be to weaken ^LmW^kXwM               the discipline and unity of the world Communist movement and to encourage other ^LmW^k-wm               parties, for example, the Albanian, to stand up to the CPSU when their own ^mwM^k-WM               interests demand it.   Yugoslavia had already shown that the final sanction of ^LmW^k-wm               expulsion from the Communist club was a double-edged weapon; but if the CPSU ^mjMis not ready to use it (as happened when it came to the test in November 1960) there ^mmWis no other means of compelling rebellious parties to submit. ^LmW31. In terms of the discipline of the bloc and the world Communist movement, ^LmW^LXwM               the consequences of the Moscow meeting appear to be: ^-WM^L\m%            few  ^ tne Russians will not be prevented from formulating new policies and ^Lmm^LmWrn                           doctrines, but ^Lwm^k-WM                    (b) they will have to take account of the views of other parties and cannot ^Lmm^-wM                            assume that their decisions will automatically be binding on those A mmmjmTfiJflM*       parties; ^Lmmm\\\\\ ^ the emPhasis Placed by the Moscow Statement on unity is likely to deterPeking, at any rate for some time, from publicising as forcibly as before -mmTMtheir differences with Moscow. ^LmWTOP SECRET
TOP SECRET 9IV-DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DISPUTE SINCE THE MOSCOWCONFERENCE32. Judged by the events of the past six months it seems fair to say that theMoscow Conference did achieve the main Soviet aim of reducing the publicmanifestations of differences in the interest of bloc unity.  Since December bothri) sides have certainly multiplied their professions of solidarity and have avoided open1 polemics.33. The most important recent event in bilateral relations has been thesignature of the Trade Protocol for 1961 which provides in effect for a short-terminterest-free loan of between $200 million and $400 million. The Protocol alsoprovides for a large immediate Soviet delivery of sugar to be repaid in kind withoutinterest. In view of China&apos;s present economic straits it is striking that the Protocolwas not more generous in the offers of Soviet help which it contained.34. Separate talks on economic relations and scientific and technical mattershave been going on for some time in Moscow, though at a comparatively low level.There are signs that Soviet specialists are beginning to trickle back to China.35. China&apos;s present economic plight and manifest dependence on Soviet aidmay to some extent have diminished her influence in the bloc and reduced herappeal to serve as a &quot; model &quot; for under-developed countries.36. Particular signs of disturbance beneath the Sino-Soviet facade haveincluded the following:(i) Evidence which has been obtained from various sources that the Chinesehave been eager to pursue a more forward policy over Laos, and thatthe Russians have not always been comfortable under this pressure.The Soviet aid to Laos-the first such aid given by the Russians sincethe Korean War to a military action outside the bloc-may have beenpartly motivated by the Soviet desire to forestall Chinese criticism ofbeing laggards in supporting revolutionary movements.(ii) Fragmentary evidence is available of competition between Moscow andH   1 Peking in giving aid to Burma, Cambodia, Mongolia, Laos, NorthKorea and North Vietnam.(iii) Russia has stepped up her military and economic aid to Indonesia andhas encouraged the Indonesians to pursue a more forward policy overWest Irian-all of this, presumably, to demonstrate that they can beas dynamic as the Chinese, and to counter Chinese influence.(iv) The Russians have complained about the French atomic tests in a waywhich probably owes something to their difficulties with the Chinesein the nuclear field.(v) Further clashes have been reported in Communist Front Organisations.(vi) The continued Chinese support for Albania and the deterioration inrelations between Tirana and Moscow must have an increasingly badeffect on Sino-Soviet relations.(vii) The Chinese message of congratulation on the manned space flight, incontrast with those of all other members of the bloc, was on a purelygovernmental basis and contained no reference to either party. Thisalmost amounts to an open admission that, though State relations areproper, party relations still leave much to be desired.(viii) Comment from Peking and Moscow on the Vienna meeting shows thatthe two parties are as far apart as ever on the question of whethernegotiations with the United States can ever be fruitful.(ix) Finally, the two leaders have still not met since Khrushchev visited Pekingin the autumn of 1959. I. V.-CONCLUSIONSA.-General37.

Mao&apos;s stature in the bloc has ^L-Wprobably not been affected either way by the Mjpscow Conference from which he ^L-M^LmM personally stood aloof. Other parties and the under-developed world generally ^Lm\cannot fail to be influenced by the contrast between Soviet achievement and^LwM               Chinese weakness in the economic held. ^L-M^L\WM               B.-Future Bilateral Relations between Peking and Moscow ^L\WM38. -(a) The disagreement is likely to continue on both the ideological* andpractical plane, though remaining for some time out of the glare of publicity. ^L-WtThere is no reason to suppose that a fundamental reconciliation will become anyeasier with time, though the disappearance of either Mao or Khrushchev wou|| ^L-Wremove one important personal cause of friction.(b) A great deal of convenience remains in the marriage-in addition to theideological bonds-and, while the conditions for a divorce exist, both sides see ^--M^L-Wm               overriding advantages in maintaining the relationship. ^L-M(c) The Chinese claim that the world Communist movement derives advantagefrom diversity of opinion and argument within its ranks; &quot; Unity through Struggle &quot;is now the leitmotif of Peking.

This may impede Soviet freedom of action ^L-Min the Far East. The Chinese can have no reason to hope in the near future to ^Lmgobtain nuctear weapons from the Soviet Union or help in the development of such WxW.^Lwm               C.-Attitude Likely to be Adopted by Peking and Moscow towards Under- ^Lw\developed Countries ^L-M39. The main difference between Peking and Moscow over the correct ^Lwmstrategy to be pursued is likely to persist and to cause further wnbarrassment. ^L-M^LWm               China&apos;s support for revolutionary elements in Africa, Asia and Catin America ^L-Mis likely in the long run to jeopardise her relations with existing Governments ^L%W^LWM               of countries in those areas, though in the current year Peking can be expectedto make a special effort to appear &quot; reasonable &quot;.   Mocfover so long as China ^L%W^L-Wa               remains unable to resolve her own internal difficu|tieSt -and continues to be so ^L%W^LWm obviously dependent upon the SdvmWm^h. economically, her claim to serve as ^LwJ^LWM               the &quot; model &quot; for the development of backward countries ,vwffbe impaired. Whilstrecognising, as they do in the Moscow Statenwit, the unreliability of bourgeois ^Lwgregimes, the Russians are likely to continue to extend aid to them as wel&amp;as to ^Lwm^L-Wm              Communist countries in accordance with their present practice. ^Lmg^LwM               D.-The Balance of Power in the International Communist Movement ^Lwm40. Chinese determination to increase their following among Communists ^Lwm^LWm and extremists particularly in Africa and Latin America could create a real ^L-M^LWm               challenge to Soviet hegemony. So long as they think the majority is on their side -mmthe Russians will probably try to enforce majority rule and this will be a continuingsource of friction with China.41. Chinese intrigues are likely to create internal schisms which may havea debilitating effect on individual parties and world Communist fronts.42. The formal structure of the bloc has been little changed by the longdispute and the Moscow Conference. The Soviet Union can apparently stillcontrol its European satellites, except Albania, and seems to have more influence fthan China over the rest of the bloc including North Korea and North Vietnam. ^-MBut on the insistence of the Chinese, the Moscow Conference has established that ^-Mthe Soviet Party cannot automatically commit the others, that any party has aright to question its decisions and that only unanimous decisions of all the partieswill bind the movement as a whole. The dispute has thus demonstrated that the ^-MTOP SECRET ^Lm
TOP SECRET^f^ft             unity of the bloc and Soviet primacy are both subject to limitations. The Soviet ^f^ftUnion and China have failed to agree on important matters. China has attacked^f^fi             Soviet policies, and the Soviet Union has failed to exact a public apology or ^f^ft^f^fi            recantation.   Less comforting to the West, the bloc has apparently contained ^f^ft^^fl this bitter quarrel without an open break and without offering the West anobviously exploitable weakness. The quarrel has not diminished the effectiveness ^^fl^f^fi            with which the Soviet Union and China can pursue in parallel their anti-Westernjj| policies.E.-Future Foreign Policies of the Russians and Chinese in the light of the Dispute43. The most important question for the West is the extent to which MoscowI        and Peking may have been induced to modify their attitude and tactics towardsthe outside world as a result of the long and bitter dispute, and the Moscow^LmmW Conference. Before trying to answer this in detail, one general comment is called ^fgrn\\\\m \\\m44. On the basis of the evidence of the dispute, and of events since the^f^M Moscow meeting, it would be wrong to conclude that the key to understanding ^f^f*all Moscow&apos;s moves lies in their difficulties with the Chinese; or, as is sometimes ^f^fl^f^M suggested, that, as a result of the meeting, the bloc as a whole, including the^^fl Chinese, have decided upon some new direction of policy. The overall objectives----M of Soviet and Chinese policies will continue to be much as before.  It was never ^f^ft^^fl really on the cards that Khrushchev or Mao would change their fundamental,and, in many ways, incompatible, beliefs. The material now available confirmsthat the differences are likely to persist. There are, in fact, other things just aspertinent as the dispute, which shape current Soviet and Chinese decisions; onthe Soviet side, for instance, there is the growing self-confidence-the apparentlyover-weening assumption that, with their economic and scientific prowess, the^f^ft tide of history will sweep Communism rapidly and inexorably towards world^f^ft mastery over capitalism; on the Chinese side, there is the present grave economic^f^ft crisis which, together with their overriding need to lay a firm industrial foundation^f^ft for the country&apos;s economy and military strength, must exercise considerablerestraint on foreign adventurism.45. Nevertheless, the dispute certainly has had, and will continue to have, j^H^f^ft            a considerable impact on the tactics and behaviour of Moscow and Peking towardsthe non-Communist world.^f^ft 46.  The effect on particular issues may be as follows:The Russians(a) East-West Relations.-The Russians will remain eager to avoid the risk^f^fi of provoking a nuclear war, and will continue to intone their belief^f^fi in the doctrine of peaceful co-existence. But the element of struggle inpeaceful co-existence will be stressed more insistently. The knowledge^f^ft that the Chinese regard America as the main enemy reinforces the other^f^ft reasons which the Russians have for pitching their talk of detente in a^f^fi lower key than in the Camp David era. They will be less inclined thanever to give any impression of retreating under Western pressure.^f^ft H (b) Areas of Conflict with the West in the Under-developed World.-WhileWWW seeking a holding action, which will leave them free to concentrate on^f^fi the economic, political and ideological struggle inherent in peaceful^f^fi co-existence, the Russians will be readier than formerly, to exploit all^f^fi &quot; wars of national liberation &quot;. Thus, with an eye on the Chinese, theywill probably wish to demonstrate their readiness to give dynamicsupport to revolutionary situations in South-East Asia, continuing with^f^fi their forward policy in Laos and encouraging the Indonesians to actionover West Irian; in Latin America and Africa the Russians will likewise^f^fi be anxious not to appear slower than Peking in supporting revolutionary(c) Berlin.-Although other considerations are clearly more important, the^f^fa impatience which the Chinese are believed to have expressed hithertoover Soviet policies may contribute to Moscow&apos;s conviction that theymust bring off some early settlement of this question.TOP SECRET ^^WlWS9308 c
I 12 TOP SECRET(d) Disarmament and Nuclear Tests.-The fact that the Russians can no longerbe confident of their ability to speak for the Chinese must be one of theconsiderations which has prompted the Russians to change their attitudetowards disarmament and nuclear tests. In shaping a new policy onthese subjects, they will have to take account of Peking&apos;s intransigence. ^^flThe Chinese(e) The Chinese, having challenged Soviet policy vis-a-vis the West and the %under-developed countries in its general principles and in its applicationto particular crises, will continue to resist any attempt by the Russiansto speak for them or negotiate on their behalf. In particular, they willcontinue to try to build up their influence in South-East Asia, Africa andLatin America in the belief that the Chinese example is at least asrelevant to these areas as that of the Soviet Union. ^^fl(f) However, while remaining 100 per cent. anti-American, it is possible thatthe Chinese will try to cultivate better relations with other Western ^^flcountries.  While preaching a more militant policy for the bloc as awhole, their own policy, paradoxically, may continue, in practice, to beunmilitant in action, at any rate during their present economicdifficulties.  They are, moreover, likely in the current year to try toestablish themselves in world opinion as a reasonable and mature greatPower in order to try to make up the ground lost recently by their actionsin Tibet and South-East Asia, and thereby to rally support for theiradmission to the United Nations.WWW 9 ; II TOP SECRET
TOP SECRET-GUARD 13Appendix I to H^^lJ.I.C. (61) 27 (Final)CHRONOLOGICAL SUMMARY OF THE SINO-SOVIET DISPUTE\\\\\\\ ^1 Differences between the Chinese and Soviet Parties arose within a few years ofthe foundation of the Chinese Party in 1921 and remained endemic in tl^grelationship. In the recent exchanges neither side made much reference to theseearlier differences. There is, however, an interesting claim by the Russians that theyhad &quot; never agreed &quot; to Liu Shao-chi&apos;s call at the World Federation of Trades UnionsI Congress in 1949 for the launching of &quot; an armed struggle everywhere &quot; and the&apos;; formation of liberation armies &quot;.* Liu&apos;s speech was endorsed by the Soviet-controlled Cominform journal and has hitherto been regarded as the expression ofa mutually agreed policy, in accordance with which the Communists during thepreceding year had gone into open rebellion in Malaya, Indonesia, Burma and thePhilippines and adopted tactics of violence in South India. Without accepting eitherthe present Soviet or Chinese account of the attitudes they adopted at the time, wej may conclude that Chinese advocacy of a forward policy in Asia, which would repeatthe success of the Chinese revolution, was to some extent a cause of friction betweenthe two Powers.2. At the preparatory commission before the Moscow Conference there wereviolent recriminations on both sides when the Russians denounced the Chinese forhaving in 1954 erected a mausoleum in Inner Mongolia to receive the ashesI of Genghiz Khan, whom Ulanfu, the Inner Mongolian leader, described at theceremony as the &quot; unifier of the Mongol tribes &quot;.t  That what might seem to us atMM^^ trivial incident should have aroused strong passion six years later is an indication of tmm^^the sensitivity of the Russians on the question of Chinese claims to Outer Mongolia.1956j The 20th Congress of the CPSU3. The Chinese Party in their correspondence with the Soviet Party duringthe current dispute, while admitting that there had been divergencies even in Stalin&apos;slifetime, denied the Soviet contention that differences had arisen only recently.According to the Chinese, the dispute should be dated from the 20th Congress of theSoviet Party in February 1956 when they claim to have objected to the way in whichde-Stalinisation was carried out, to have disagreed with the Soviet thesis on theI possibility of peaceful transition to socialism and to have protested at the fact thatin neither case were other parties consulted. + The Chinese did not claim to havetMM^A disputed the Soviet theory on the inevitability of war, which was later to assume suchimportance in the controversy. In fact, they endorsed it publicly immediately afterthe Conference, while pointedly refraining from any mention of the Soviet view on&quot; peaceful transition&quot;.4. Chinese reservations on the subject of de-Stalinisation were reflected inI         their statement, published on 5th April, &quot; On the Historical Experience of theDictatorship of the Proletariat &quot;, which, while apparently approving Khrushchev&apos;sactions, stressed the favourable aspects of Stalin&apos;s career. Mikoyan, who wasvisiting Hanoi, cancelled his engagements on the appearance of this article, and flewto Peking where on 6th April he claimed to have been assured by Mao that &quot; theChinese Party fully and unreservedly approved of all that the Soviet Party did fromBeria&apos;s arrest up to and including the 20th Congress. The report on the cult of theindividual was of no less importance to the Chinese Communist Party and the other* Liu Shao-chi did not in fact advocate the launching of an armed struggle everywhere but only ^^^H&quot; whenever and wherever possible &quot; and &quot; in some colonial and semi-colonial countries &quot;. TinsSoviet distortion was matched by the subsequent Chinese claim that they had wanted WFTU not tom organise armed struggles but only sympathise with them. ^^^Hf Apart from the Mongol population of the Soviet satellite, the Mongolian Peoples&apos; Republic, ^^^Hthere are two Mongol areas in the USSR itself-the Buryat Republic and Tannu Tuva. ^^^HJ Note.-Khrushchev claimed at Moscow that both the Chinese and Albanians had received ^^^Jadvance copies of his speech attacking Stalin and had made no comments.  He did not, however,suggest that they had been asked for their opinions. ^^^HTOP SECRET-GUARD

On the following day Liu Shao-chi allegedly assured Mikoyan thathe too &quot; fully approved &quot;. This Soviet version of the Chinese attitude is certainlyI belied by the tone of the article; the Soviet Press carried it but with certain omissions,notably paragraphs on the continuing danger of the cult of the individual and theB possibility of   contradictions&quot; in a classless society. I I5. In September, as the Russians stressed in the recent correspondence, the g\8th Congress of the Chinese Party endorsed the Soviet 20th Congress.   The yendorsement was, however, so tepid and in such general terms as to implydisagreement. The Congress moreover was the scene of a diplomatic incident. TheB Chinese deeply resented the patronising tone of the speech delivered by the Soviet Hdelegate, Mikoyan, who left Peking before the conclusion of the Congress; and theepisode left a sufficient scar to be dragged up during the recent exchanges. J HThe Polish and Hungarian Uprisings6. In their correspondence with the Soviet Party, the Chinese makeconsiderable play with their alleged interventions at the time of the Polish and? Hungarian crises in October 1956.  According to the Chinese, they prevented theRussians from convening a conference of the world Communist movement tocondemn the Poles and insisted that parties should advise the Poles individually. I HThe Chinese also claimed that they had had to intervene in order to stop the Russianswithdrawing their troops from Hungary at the crisis of the uprising. In their replythe Russians maintained that the Conference was suggested only as a measure forrallying world Communist opinion and not in order tc condemn the Poles. Asregards Hungary, the Russians flatly denied the Chinese story, pointing out that ?&amp;was the Chinese who had vacillated; they had allegedly maintained that the fir^tintervention was uncalled for and suggested a few weeks&apos; delay before the SovietUnion took action finally to crush thesfevolt.* Whatever theStruth of the matter,there is no reason to think that the Russian actions were much influenced by Chineserepresentations on either Poland or Hungary.7. At the end of December the Chinese published a further statement &quot; Moreon the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat&quot;, in which they Hlectured the Russians on how to conduct bloc relations and carried theI rehabilitation of Stalin a stage further. The tone of this article, when compared I Hwith that of Chinese propaganda during the Polish and Hungarian crises, showedan increased awareness of the dangers of indiscipline in the bloc. It was reprintedH by the Russians with the omission of one sentence in which the Chinese quotesapprovingly the condemnation by Tito of the West during the Suez crisis.1957The Hundred Flowers I I8. During the first half of 1957, the Chinese were pre-occupied with their&quot; Hundred Flowers &quot; campaign, which had been cautiously initiated in the April1956 statement on de-Stalinisation and reached its climax in Mao&apos;s unpublishedspeeches of 27th February and 12th March. In these Mao developed his views onthe possibility of &quot; contradictions &quot; between the leadership of the party and the Hmasses and on the desirability of criticism of the party by non-party membeSL? The Russians regarded both ideas as subversive; and at the Bucharest Conferefjp,        ] Ilast year Khrushchev accused the Chinese of having at this time improperlydisseminated propaganda in Russian about the &quot; Hundred Flowers &quot; inside theSoviet Union, although they knew that the Russians disagreed with this theory.In June, Mao issued an emasculated version of his February speech. By Septemberthe &quot; Hundred Flowers &quot; had been abandoned in favour of 1 rectification &quot; afMrepression of &quot; rightists &quot;. Mao, like Khrushchev, had tried liberalisation and had Iequally come to grief.* According to the Russians, Liu Shao-chi, who had been invited to Moscow at the end of m\October, had criticised some aspects of Soviet policy but agreed that there should be no withdrawal. TOn November 1st, when the situation had deteriorated, the Chinese suggested temporising. TheRussians disagreed and informed Liu Shao-chi, before his departure from Moscow, of the intention*  intervene in force, which was officially taken by the Soviet Presidium on November 4. Shortlyafterwards, Liu Shao-chi told the Soviet Ambassador in Peking that the Russians should have waiteda few weeks before repressing the revolt, so that Nagy would have &quot; unmasked himself &quot;.f OP SECRET-GUARD
TOP SECRET-GUARD 15 X-U^LmW 9.  In January 1957 Chou En-lai interrupted his Asian tour in order to visit ^LmW^kmm Moscow and Eastern Europe.   Khrushchev took the opportunity of speaking ^LmWWk^MM about Stalin in more favourable terms than he had used in the past, but went on ^LmW^Lmm to issue a warning against the use of force in order to bring about the downfall ^LmW^LmW of the capitalist system. In July Molotov and the anti-party group were dismissed. ^LmWWk^M In a brief note, which indicated that they had not been informed in advance, the \mmm\^LmW Chinese Central Committee informed the Soviet Party of their approval.  Many ^LmM^LmW     of Molotov&apos;s policies were certainly nearer to the Chinese line than Khrushchev&apos;s. ^LmMWk^M The Chinese no less than Molotov had their doubts about de-Stalinisation, the TmmW^LWW 1        possibility of &quot; peaceful transition to Socialism &quot; and Khrushchev&apos;s interpretation ^mjM^LWW of peaceful co-existence.  However, they had little choice but to accept the fait wXwM^LmW accompli.  They were later to claim that they signed the Moscow Declaration of ^LmWWk^M November in order to strengthen Khrushchev&apos;s hand against the &quot; anti^party &quot; mmmW^LmW group. It was certainly fortunate for Sino-Soviet relations that the fall of Mokhov ^LmWWk\W occurred before the Chinese had gone over fully to his point of view.  In July ^LmM^LmW 1         1957 the Chinese were still nominally in favour of liberalisation at home and a soft ^LmU^LWW policy towards the satellites and Yugoslavia. ^LmMThe Moscow Conference ^LwMmwk^M 10.  In November the Moscow Conference was called with the object of ^LmW^Lmw restoring discipline in the world Communist movement after the Polish and ^LmW^LXW I        Hungarian disasters.  The Chinese presented documents in which they criticised ^LmW^LWW the &quot; incorrect proposals &quot; of the Soviet Party.  However the Declaration issued ^LmW^LWW after the Conference endorsed the disputed dogmas of the 20th Congress of the ^LmW^LmW CPSU in terms satisfactory to the Russians.   The Chinese, while categorically ^LmW^LWW asserting the indispensability of Soviet leadership, maintained their objections and \mmm\Wk\jM &apos; put in a written statement to the effect that they signed the Declaration in the ^Lmm^LXW 1        interests of unity and despite continuing disagreement with some of the views ^LmW^LWW expressed, notably on the possibility of &quot; peaceful transition to Socialism &quot;. ^LmW^LmW 11.  The Russians had tested their first ICBM in August and launched their ^LmW^LWW first sputnik a month later. Under the impact of these two events Mao&apos;s strategic ^LmWf-W-wM thinking crystallised into the simple concept that, in view of Soviet nuclear w\wM^Lmm achievements, the Communists could indulge in adventurous policies with little ^LWWWk%W fear Of retaliation from the West.   In a public speech, while attending the^LmW Conference, Mao announced his discovery that a &quot; turning-point&quot; had been ^LmW^LmW reached in which &quot; the East wind prevails over the West&quot;-a definition which in ^LmW^Lmw the recent correspondence was denounced by the Russians as &quot; juggling with ^LmWywkyM geographical and meteorological terminology &quot;. In his unpublished speech at the wkmW^LWW Conference, while postulating the desirability of 10 years of peace and coming out ^LmW^L\W in favour of the abolition of the hydrogen bomb, Mao developed further the theme ^LmW^LWW that, despite the superiority of the West in some fields such as that of steel ^LmW^LmW production, the balance of advantage already lay with the Communist countries, ^LmW^LWW repeating the point which he had made before that, if half the world&apos;s population ^LmW^LWW were wiped out in a nuclear war, half would survive.  Khrushchev disputed the wkmWwkmW Chinese assessment and in December issued his proposal for a Summit conference ^Lmm\^h\jm ?        with the West. ^LWrnThe &quot; Great Leap Forward&quot; m\\\\^LmW 12.  Chinese advocacy of boldness in foreign policy coincided with the^Lmw decreeing of an &quot; upsurge &quot; in the domestic economy, which soon developed intommmwm a frenetic &quot; great leap forward &quot; in every field.  During the recent controversy,^LmW Khrushchev expressed his contempt for this whole theory, pointing out that the^LmW economy of a country should develop regularly.  His words presumably reflect^LWW the protests made at the time by the Soviet technicians working in China. Relations WaWw^LWW between them and the Chinese authorities were already bad. In 1956 China had^Lmw raised the possibility of their being withdrawn.   The reasons are not known,^LmW although there is some indication that the Chinese were discontented with SovietWkmW concentration on more ambitious projects, and the deterioration in Sino-Soviet^Lmwm I         relations at the time of the 20th Congress may also have played a part. Them\\\m % position of the technicians cannot have been improved by a fundamental Sino-Soviet^LmwM disagreement on Chinese economic methods.^Lmw Military Co-operation ^LmmMmwk^M 13.  In November, at the time of the international conference, a high-powered^LXW 1        Chinese military delegation, headed by Marshal Peng Te-huai, the Minister ofTOP SECRET-GUARD
16 TOP SECRET-GUARD^Lwm               Defence, was in Moscow. It has been inferred that it may have been as a result ^--Mm-WM               of this conference that the Chinese realised that they had no prospect of being I^L%W               given nuclear weapons by the Russians. Certainly there was a change of emphasis ^L9%W-^m               in such references to the equipment of Chinese forces with nuclear weapons as ^--W^L%Wt appeared in the Chinese Press before and after 1957. Earlier references stressed ^--W^LmW               the importance of nuclear weapons and left open the question of where such^LmW               equipment would come from.  However, in May and June 1958 a four weeks&apos; I^LmW               military conference in China not only reaffirmed the continuing reliability of fpiMao&apos;s military doctrine in a nuclear age but led to statements denying that the a-Wm^L-W outcome of a war would depend on atomic weapons and declaring that China ^Lmg^L-m               would manufacture an atom bomb by her own efforts and in her own time.^L-W Growing Chinese Militancy^Lwa                     14.  During the first half of 1958, the Chinese continued to advocate their ^L-M^L-W               militant line, notably in Chou En-lai&apos;s report on foreign affairs to the National mx-MPeople&apos;s Congress (10th February) and in the speech of Chen Yun, the Chinese ^L-wtMxm observer at the Warsaw Pact Meeting in Moscow (late May). Chou En-lai&apos;s I mjmm^L-m               reference to the liberation of Formosa without the usual mention of &quot; peacefulM^Lm               means &quot; perhaps foreshadowed China&apos;s action against the off-shore islands later ^L%W^L%W               in the year. In view of reliable reports that Khrushchev in fact regards a &quot; Two mX-W,^LWm               Chinas &quot; solution as inevitable in the long run, it is possible that Chou En-lai&apos;s ^L-wwMxM               words about &quot; even friends of China&quot;, who advocate such ideas, although I mx-M^L-W                apparently directed at the uncommitted countries, were also intended as a warning ^LmgM^M               to the Soviet Union. ^L-W^Lw\                     15.  Before the Warsaw Pact Meeting Chen Yun had attended the meeting ^Lw\^L-m               of the Council of Mutual Economic Aid, also as an observer.  Chen Yun, now ^L-W^L-m               under eclipse as a &quot; Rightist &quot;, was then the senior member of the Chinese Politburo m\-W^L-W               responsible for the co-ordination of economic policy and well known as an advocate ^L-MwM\M of more cautious policies. Certainly Chen Yun shared the dislike of the Russians I ^^fl^L%W               for the &quot; great leap forward &quot; then in full swing in China; and it would&quot;have bed|^L-W                natural for the Russians to take this opportunity of making their views known. ^L%W^L-W 16. At the beginning of May the Chinese used the occasion of the publication ^L-W^L-M               of the Yugoslav&apos;s party programme to launch a violent propaganda attack on Tito.^L-M               While apparently backing up the Soviet campaign against Yugoslav revisionism WMxW^L-W               which had been in action since the Moscow Conference, the Chinese went much ^L-MWMxW further in virulence. During 1956 and the first half of 1957 Sino-Yugoslav relations I^L-W had been much better than Soviet-Yugoslav relations. The new &quot; hard &quot; Chinese^L-m               line on Yugoslavia was to endure as one of the main fields in which Sino-Soviet ^L-Wfriction could be detected.The Iraq and Formosa Crises I^L-W                     17.  In July the Iraqi coup was followed by the landing of American andM\-m                British troops in the Lebanon and Jordan.  While Khrushchev&apos;s reaction was to ^L-Wcall for a Summit meeting, the Chinese Press clamoured for armed intervention ^L-W^LmM                and the sending of volunteers.   Chinese indignation at Khrushchev&apos;s failure to ^LmgmX-M                exploit the situation and call what China regarded as Western bluff must have I wM-W^L-M               been increased by his ill-considered acceptance on 23rd July of the Western counter- ^L-MWx-m                proposal of a Summit meeting within the framework of the United Nations Security M^M^Lmm                Council, at which Formosa but not China would have been represented. Although ^L-Mpositive evidence is lacking, it may be assumed that this proposal met with the most ^Lmgm-mm                vigorous protests from the Chinese. On 28th July Khrushchev in effect withdrew       I Wx-Wthis acceptance and three days later arrived in Peking for a three-day visit ^Lmgum%W                accompanied by Marshal Malinovsky, his Minister of Defence. ^Lmg18. With the prospect of Anglo-American recognition of the Iraqi regime ^L-Wthe worst of the crisis in the Middle East was already past and Khrushchev&apos;s visit ^L-Mwas probably concerned immediately with Chinese plans for action against the ^ wMxWoff-shore islands, propaganda preparations for which were already in train.        T ^L-m19. The subject of Formosa was barely touched on in the recent I MxWmcorrespondence, apart from a reference by the Soviet Party to Khrushchev&apos;s second ^L-Mletter of 19th September to President Eisenhower, threatening reprisals if Chinawere attacked with nuclear weapons, as evidence of Soviet support for China wMxWTOP SECRET-GUARD
^LW TOP SECRET-GUARD 17during the crisis.  In fact, this letter, like the letter of 7th September, was written m\\\\I after Chou En-lai had offered on 6th September to renew ambassadorial talks with^LwM the United States-i.e., when the worst of the crisis was past.  While proof is^LwM lacking the balance of evidence is in favour of the view that the Russians acted ^WwJW^mW throughout as a restraining influence.  In any case, the disasters suffered by the I^LmM Chinese air force, which found itself shot down by Nationalist planes equipped ^WwA^LwM with air-to-air missiles, must have caused deep resentment at the failure of the^LwM   I    w   Russians to provide their allies with this weapon.^LwM I 20.  A clue to the Soviet attitude is perhaps provided by Khrushchev&apos;sstatement that &quot; we have not interfered, and do not intend to interfere, in the civilwar which the Chinese are waging against the Chiang Kai-shek clique&quot;. ^LwM^LwM Khrushchev may in fact have agreed, however reluctantly, to the operation which^LmM the Chinese in fact undertook, viz., interdiction of the off-shore islands by ^LwM^LmM bombardment, and agreed to give diplomatic support, provided that there was no ^LWM^LwM I attempt at invasion, which would have provoked an American reaction, thereby^LwW turning the operation from a civil into a general war, and entitling the Chinese^LwM to invoke the military clauses of the Sino-Soviet Treaty.^LWM 21.  In any event, it is certain that there was a serious crisis in Sino-Soviet^LwM relations at this time.  In the recent correspondence the Russians mentioned that^LwM Khrushchev had visited Peking, in view of the difficulties which had arisen between^LwM the two parties, and had a &quot; frank discussion &quot; with Mao.  It is also significantmrmm that the Chinese should either at or immediately after Khrushchev&apos;s visit have^LMM again raised the question of the withdrawal of the Soviet technicians.^LWM 22.  The publication in October of a collection of Mao&apos;s writings under the^LMM title &quot; Imperialists and all reactionaries are Paper Tigers &quot; was not only an attempt^LMM I to explain away China&apos;s reverse but a deliberate defiance of the Soviet Union,^LMM which, by publishing brief references to the work, refused to allow it to circulate in^LMM translation. In the Soviet view, &quot; contemporary imperialism is not a paper tiger &quot;,^LMM since it has nuclear weapons of destruction at its disposal.^LMM The Communes ^LWM^LwM 23.  A week after Khrushchev&apos;s departure from Peking, the Chinese officiallymXwM launched their commune programme, with which a number of unrealistic economic^LMM projects, notably &quot; back-yard &quot; steel, were associated.  Although the Russians were^LMM presumably aware of this preliminary experimentation going on in China, there is^LMM reason to think that Mao did not reveal his plans to Khrushchev during their^LMM meeting and that the Russians were taken aback by the scope of this new innovation^LMM and by the ideological claims made for it.  The Soviet Union showed its displeasureby publicly ignoring Chinese pretensions to have discovered a short road to^LMM Communism.  We must however assume that there was an immediate and strong^LMM reaction in private.  Otherwise it is inconceivable that not only Soviet Satellites^LMM but a country such as North Vietnam, with its close links to the Chinese Party,^LMM should have preserved (as it still does) the taboo on any mention in the Press of^LMM the possibility  that  the  communes  might  be  introduced  outside China.%WU Nevertheless the Chinese innovation seems in fact to have been viewed with^LMM sympathy by a number of parties.  North Korea, North Vietnam and Outer^LMM Mongolia during the succeeding years introduced amalgamation of co-operatives^LMM which looked almost like proto-communes.   Even East European Satellites,^LMM notably Bulgaria, Eastern Germany and Albania, showed themselves attracted by^LMM    I the new idea.KW- 24.  At the end of December the Wuhan plenary session of the Chinese Party^LMM announced a revision of the commune programme which involved the abandonment^LMM df. many of the features most objectionable to the Russians.   The disorganisation^LMM caused by the over-hasty introduction of the communes and internal power^LMM struggles in the Chinese leadership would be sufficient by themselves to account^LMM for this change of line. There is little or no evidence on the extent to which Soviet^LMM    I         disapproval was also a factor.  Nor do we know how the retirement of Mao from^LMM the chairmanship of the Chinese People&apos;s Republic, also announced at Wuhan,W^mW Was related to the back-pedalling on communes and the dispute with the Soviet^LMM Union.  It is clear, however, that, if Soviet pressure was effectively exerted, it was^LMM by threats or conceivably by intrigues with &quot; Rightist&quot; elements in the Chinese^LMM hierarchy.  While full agreement was certainly not achieved, it is possible thatTOP SECRET-GUARD m\\\\\mlm mlmM
mm18 TOP SECRET-GUARDfresh Soviet aid negotiated between September 1958 and February 1959 may havebeen a quid pro quo for the revision of the commune programme.25. In December 1958 Khrushchev openly criticised the Chinese communesin an interview with Senator Humphrey. According to the secret1intelligence, theChinese subsequently criticised Khrushchev for discussing the dispute withimperialists and generally for &quot; talking too much &quot;. In subsequent interviews withWestern statesmen, Khrushchev was much more discreet in his references to China g.and it is likely that his remarks to Senator Humphrey were the subject of Chinese *protests at the time and of resentment afterwards.B Front Organisations I26. Meanwhile the first disputes between the USSR and China on the &quot; frontorganisations &quot; had broken out in the July meeting at Stockolm of the World PeaceCouncil and in the September meeting in Peking of the International Union ofStudents. In the former case the Chinese wished to flout pacifist opinion byturning the WPC into an anti-colonialist organisation.  In the second case theyI opposed Soviet ideas for collaboration between the IUS and the Western student Horganisation COSEC.  These and similar controversies in other front organisationsI were to become a continual and growing irritant in Sino-Soviet relations. H195921st Congress of the CPSU27. In February the 21st Congress of the Soviet Party not only launched aI powerful, if oblique, attack both on the communes and on Chinese economic Hinnovations but carried the doctrines of the 20th Congress a small step further byI asserting the possibility of excluding world war even before the disappearance ... |Hof capitalism. The Chinese, although their references to this Congress wereunderstandably tepid, did not react as strongly as might have been expected. Thismay have been due partly to internal difficulties and partly to the fact that, evenif the Russian line on the possibility of a detente with the West remainedunsatisfactory from the Chinese point of view, Khrushchev had in Novemberissued a six months time limit for a settlement on Berlin, which the Chinese couldwholeheartedly endorse.The Iraqi Uprising28. In March the Mosul rebellion against Quasim was followed by massacresin which the Communists played a leading part. During the succeeding monthsthe Chinese were active in encouraging the more militant elements in the Iraqiparty to adopt a policy of violence which culminated in the unsuccessful Kirkukuprising of mid-July. The Russians, concerned for their relations with Nasser,had favoured a more cautious line and in the recent controversy Khrushchev wasto blame the troubles of the Iraqi Communists on the Chinese who had pursuadedthem to over-estimate their strength.Marshal Peng Te-huai&apos;s Letter to the CPSU29. From 24th April to 13th June Marshal Peng Te-huai, the Chinese Ministerof Defence, was making a tour of Eastern Europe in the course of which he metKhrushchev at Tirana on 25th May. It was probably during this visit that theChinese authorities learnt that Peng had written a letter to the CPSU attackingthe communes. Such intrigues were regarded by the Chinese as treasonable andPeng&apos;s offence was increased by his presentation to the plenary session of theCentral Committee, held at Lushan in early August, of a document criticising thewhole policy of the party, including the &quot; great leap forward &quot; and the communes.Although he received influential support, Peng&apos;s attack was unsuccessful. At theend of September his dismissal, together with that of the Chief of the Army Staff,was officially announced.  The other Rightists, while thenceforth excluded from Iinfluence, seem nominally to have retained their positions.  They included Chen mYun, fourth in the hierarchy of the party, and one, or possibly two, former wrepresentatives of the Comintern and successive Ambassadors to Moscow.30. The incident must have caused a profound shock to Sino-Soviet relations.Although the full extent of the crisis was successfully concealed from the outsideworld, Mao is reliably reported to have said at Lushan that, if the army provedTOP SECRET-GUARD I
TOP SECRET-GUARD 19disloyal, he would return to the villages and recruit another one. Khrushchev,however, was unrepentant. During his visit to America, he privately expressedhis admiration for Peng Te-huai as the one man who had tried to do somethingabout correcting the errors of Chinese policy and, at the Bucharest Conference inthe following year, openly endorsed Peng&apos;s actions, coupling his name with that ofKao Kang, the &quot; overlord&quot; of Manchuria, who in 1954 was disgraced andcommitted suicide. Kao Kang is known, like Peng, to have had private links withW the Soviet Union at the time of his fall. BKhrushchev&apos;s Visit to the United States31. On 3rd August Khrushchev announced his intention of visiting the UnitedStates. The Chinese resented his praise of Eisenhower before the visit of Mao andhe himself seems to have been appalled by Khrushchev&apos;s reference to the leader ofthe country which the Chinese considered the &quot; main enemy &quot; as a man of peace.However, preoccupied with a major purge and involved in their dispute with India,the Chinese gave qualified approval to the new policy of detente, notably in anarticle which appeared in the party organ Red Flag under the title &quot; PeacefulCompetition and Peaceful Co-existence are Inevitable Trends &quot;. On 9th September,I I however, the Russians published their disavowal of China in the dispute with India.The Chinese bitterly resented what seemed to them a condemnation and Sino-Sovietrelations entered a phase of increasing tension.H 32.  At the end of September the Chinese caused an incident with the UAR Hby publishing a speech made in Peking by the Syrian Communist leader, Bikdash,attacking Nasser. Bikdash himself was subsequently to figure as a strong supporterof the Soviet Union. However, the strain in Sino-Egyptian relations made it morenatural for the Chinese to extend the quarrel with the Soviet Union by objectingto the Soviet policy of pouring money into Egypt despite the persecution of theEgyptian Communist Party.Khrushchev&apos;s Visit to Peking33. On 30th September Khrushchev arrived in Peking on a visit which, thoughnominally for the purpose of attending the Chinese 10th Anniversary celebrations,H I the Russians have since admitted was undertaken as a result of differences betweenthe two parties. There seems to have been a preliminary diplomatic incident whenthe Chinese arranged for Khrushchev to be met by Chou En-lai. In fact Mao andthe whole Chinese hierarchy came to the airport, presumably as a result of Sovietprotests. The meeting did not, as far as is known, result in any agreement, and itsmain result seems to have been to increase the personal antipathy between the twoleaders.34. In Peking Khrushchev had taken the opportunity to issue a public warningagainst testing the strength of imperialism by force. In his speech to the SupremeSoviet on 30th October he followed this up by a reference to Trotsky which theChinese, no doubt correctly, took as applying to themselves. In the same speechhe maintained the Soviet neutral line on the Sino-Indian dispute and endorsed theproposals made by de Gaulle in September for ending the war in Algeria: thesethe Russians had hitherto denounced. The Chinese did not change their line andH I later arranged an ostentatious demonstration of support for the FLN to coincidej^th Khrushchev&apos;s visit to France.35. During October the Russians had sent a circular to bloc parties, and alsoI                the French and Italian parties, pointing out the possibility of a detente between theSoviet Union and the United States; and and on 1st December Khrushchev, at the flHungarian Party Congress, issued another warning to the Chinese, emphasisingthe importance of &quot; not becoming conceited &quot; and the necessity for Communistcountries to &quot; synchronise their watches &quot;. The Chinese also complained that hehad criticised their communes and the &quot; great leap forward &quot; to delegates at thecongress.^196036. In January the Soviet Ambassador in Moscow raised the subject ofSino-Soviet relations with Chou En-lai, whom the Russians are known to regard asH B      favourably disposed towards them.  Chou, according to the Russians, expressedthe view that both sides should &quot; let things ride &quot;.TOP SECRET-GUARD59308 B
TOP SECRET ^-\\^LmW                 The Warsaw Pact Meeting ^Lmw37.  During the first two months of 1960 the Russians and Chinese again came I wMMM^LmW                into conflict at meetings of the World Peace Council and the International Union ^kmm^LmW                of Students; and the Chinese dissociated themselves from the declaration adopt y ^LmWby the Rome meeting of Western Communist Parties which they denounced as ^k-W^LmW                 &quot; opportunistic &quot;. In February a more serious incident occurred when Khrushchev ^kmm^L\jm                delivered a forthright attack on Chinese policies in the closed sessions of the - ^k-W^LmW                meeting of the Warsaw Pact Powers in Moscow, while Marshal Konev, the Soviet w ^kmm^LmW                Minister of Defence, is reported to have stated categorically that nuclear weapons ^LWW^LmW                would not be included in the substantial military aid to be received by China. The ^LWW^LmW                Chinese thereupon released a version of the speech made by their observer setting ^LWW^LmW                out the Chinese line in strong terms. No reference to this speech was made by the ^LWW^LmW                Soviet UflSbn or its Satellites. At the same meeting there was a disagreement as ^LmW^LmW                a result of a Chinese proposal that the Warsaw Pact should regard itself as diefccted ^LmW^LmW                 against the United States rather than West Germany as the Soviet Union wished. ^LmW^LmW                Shortly after the conference, Khrushchev left for his visit to India and Indonesia. ^Lmwm^LmW                The tour was barely reported by the Chinese. ^Lmm^LmW                 Long Live Leninism ^LmW^L\m\                      38.  In March the Central Committee of the Soviet Party invited the Qtaftese ^LmW^LmW                Central Committee to send a party and governmental delegation to Moscow to ^Lmwm^LmW                discuss the differences.  The Chinese declined and in April took the occasion of ^LmWmmwM                 the anniversary of Lenin&apos;s birth to publish a series of articles which, according to mwL\%^LmW                the Russians, &quot; attacked the line of the Soviet and of other fraternal parties&quot;&quot;. On ^LmW^LWm                22nd April Otto Kuusinen replied in Moscow on the same day that Lu Ting-i ^LmW^LmW                restated the Chinese position in Peking. The Chinese then proceeded to circulate ^Lmmf^LmW                translations of the offending articles in a variety of languages, including Russian. ^LmmfThe WFTU Meeting^L\W                      39.  Meanwhile the Xlth General Council meeting of the World Federation ^LmW^L\m\                of Trades Unions (W.F.T.U.), which met in Peking from 5th to 10th June, had ^mjM^LmW                been the scene of a most serious clash.  BeftrftJ the meeting the Chinese raised ^Lmmf^LXW                objections to the official report, without effect.  The meeting finally openii on ^LmW^LXwm                5th June after fruitless efforts to solve the differences. The Russians took particular ^LmW^Lmm                exception to the speeches of Liu Nung-yi on 7th June and Liu Chang-sheng on ^Lmwrn^LmW                8th June which cast doubt on the sincerity of the Soviet Union&apos;s disarmament ^Lmwrn^Lmm                proposals, and to the Chinese action in holding private meetings of delegates at ^LmW^LXm                which they were briefed on the Chinese line, although the Russians themselves ^LmW^LmW                lobbied. Resentment was also caused by a violent altercation between the heads ^Lmwrn^LmW                of the Russian and the Chinese delegations about the correctness of Soviet policy. ^LmwmThe Bucharest Conference^LWm                     40.  The Soviet Party had on 2nd June again invited the Chinese to bilateral ^LmW^LmW                talks, ostensibly to discuss the international situation following the collapse of the ^LmW^Lmm                Summit. The Chinese suggested a delay in order that both sides could decide on ^LmW^Lmm                their positions. On 7th June Khrushchev agreed to this but suggested preliminary ^LmwmWMMMM                discussion to be held in connexion with the forthcoming congress of the Roumanian ^Lmwrn^LmWM                Party. On 17th June the Chinese delegates to the Roumanian Congress met the ^Lmwrn^LmWM                Russians on their way through Moscow.  The talks were lengthy and ended in ^Lmwrn^LmwM                complete disagreement: the Chinese were in any case empowered only to discuss ^Lmwrnthe differences but not to commit their party. On the following day, Khrushchif ^m%m\WkmwM                announced that he would attend the Roumanian Congress in person and summonedthe first secretaries of the Soviet bloc parties to do likewise. As a result the Chinese ^Lmmf^LmWM                found themselves unexpectedly out-ranked.  The head of their delegation, Peng ^Lmmf^LXwM                Chen, the Mayor of Peking, although a member of the politburo, does not belong to ^Lmwm^LWW                its standing committee which controls policy in China. ^LmW^LmW                     41.  Fifty-one parties in all were represented at the Roumanian Congress which ^LmW^LXwM                finished on 25th June.  During this period the Russians were active in lobbying 0 ^LmWdelegates and in showing them copies of their open letter to the Chinese party, ^LmWdated 21st June. This dealt at length with Chinese deviations since the 1957 Moscow ^LmWConference and concluded with a veiled threat of sanctions in the reminder of the ^LXwrnconnexion between the development of the Chinese economy and the interests of the ^LmW^LmwM                world Communist movement. ^LmwmWm^Um TOP SECRET- _&quot;_-i ^_^^^HI I
^LM TOP SECRET                                              2% ^LM^L-M 42.  The Russians had originally proposed that discussions on the Sind-Soviet^--W dispute should be confined, as at the Moscow Conference of 1957, to delegates from^L-W flbmmunist bloc countries. Although they later agreed, on Chinese insistence, that^L-W delegates from non-Communist countries should participate, the decisive work of the^L-W conference seems in fact to have been done at a closed session of bloc partydelegations on 24th June, when the Russians produced the draft of the final^LWm communique. Peng Chen, although told that he must sign it in the interests of unity,I tP protested that he could not do so without consulting his central committee and^L-M pointed out that Mao himself had refused to sign the 1957 Declaration until it hadbeen approved by Peking. Peng therefore asked for a delay of two days. In fact^L-M the communique was not issued till 28th June; and it seems likely that the anodyne^L-M document finally produced-a simple reaffirmation of the Moscow Declaration of^L-M 1957-bore little relation to the draft presented to Peng on the 24th.^--M 43.   On 25th June the first full session was held.  Peng Chen spoke twenty-^L-M seventh. The Russians did not intervene, leaving it to the other delegates to present^L-W the Sfltyiet case.  Only the Albanian representative supported the Chinese.  In the^L-W closing session on 26th June Khrushchev delivered a savage onslaught on the^L-W Chinese to which Peng Chen replied with equal bitterness, and the proceedings^L-W closed with the unanimous adoption of the communique and of a proposal by the^L-W Russians that a commission should be set up to prepare for an international^k-W conference to be held at the time of the Soviet Anniversary celebrations in^L-W November.  The proceedings of the Bucharest conference were endorsed by the^L-W central committees of the various parties, generally speaking, in terms which the^L-W Russians would regard as satisfactory.  The Mongolians, however, had to revise^L-W their first resolution and the initial North Vietnamese attitude was altered at their^k-W party congress at the beginning of September which adopted a line very much more^L-W favourable to the Russians.^L-W The Withdrawal of the Technicians^L-W 44.  By the first half of July Soviet bloc publicity had ceased to carry news of^k-W internal developments in China, and both sides were engaged in a propaganda war^k-W in which they attacked each other in the guise of &quot; dogmatists &quot; or &quot; revisionists &quot;.^k-M On 6th July the Russians demanded that the Chinese close down Druzhba, their^L-W Russian language paper circulating in the Soviet Union, and announced that the^L-W Russians would close down the similar Chinese language paper they themselves^L-W produced in Peking.  The Soviet propaganda offensive was stepped up after the^L-W plenum of the Soviet Party&apos;s Central Committee in mid-July.  On 21st July the^k-M Chinese Embassy official responsible for the production of Druzhba was expelled^L\W from Moscow. On the same day the Russians wrote to the Chinese to complain of^L\W the treatment of their technicians in China and of alleged Chinese efforts to^L\W indoctrinate them. Orders for their withdrawal had in fact been given on 16th July^L\W without any warning to the Chinese. It is now clear that the decision was carried^L\W out. The Russians who remained seem to have qualified as embassy staff or were^L\W not regarded as technicians. On 1st August the Chinese replied to the Soviet letters^L\W about the publications and the technicans, rejecting the charges which had been^L\W made and expressing astonishment and regret at the Soviet action. On 9th August^L\\\ the Orientalists Congress at Moscow opened without the expected Chinese^L\W delegation.^L\W 45.  The dispute by now affected the whole world Communist movement.^L\W While open references to the differences were eschewed, its existence was common^L\W knowledge in Communist countries as well as in the West.   Both Russia and^L\W I China therefore, while keeping knowledge of the details of the dispute to an^L\W extremely limited circle, began cautiously to indoctrinate the &quot; cadres &quot; into the^L\W general issues under debate.  Similarly, the rank and file of Communist Parties^L\W in Western countries, while remaining dependent on the bourgeois Press for factual^L\W information, were given general guidance by the leadership on the party line.^L\W Even the Chinese Foreign Service seems to have remained largely in ignorance of^L\W what was happening.

According to the Chinese ^LwWwhat had happened was that some shepherds had strayed across the border, and ^LwWit seems possible that the vigorous Soviet reaction was intended to bring pressure ^LwMon the Chinese to accept the suggestions in the 20th August letter which was itself # ^LwMcouched in relatively conciliatory terms. ^LWM47. The Chinese, however, left the invitation unanswered and on 10th ^LwMSeptember produced their reply to the Soviet letter of 21st June which, like the ^LWMSoviet letter, was shown to the representatives of Communist Parties throughout ^LwMWXWj                the world.  On 9th September, the day before they produced this bitter attack mWMton the whole Soviet position, the Chinese finally accepted the Soviet invitation ^LwWof 20th August and agreed to come to talks in Moscow on 15th September.  A ^LmM10-man delegation arrived a day late and rejected the Soviet agenda.   By 21st ^LwMSeptember an impasse had been reached and the Chinese left the talks but returned ^LWMat the end of the day. ^LwM48. The preparatory commission of 26 parties duly assembled in Moscow at ^LwMWXWM                the end of September, under the chairmanship of the senior Soviet representative,       1 mWMtSuslov, and remained in session for 22 days.  It worked on a draft declaration ^LwMprepared by the Russians, while the Chinese tabled their letter of 10th September ^LWMfor discussion.  After considering a whole series of amendments, including over ^LMM100 from the Chinese alone, the commission finally produced a document.  The ^LwMChinese, while continuing to express their disagreement with the formulation ^LwMadopted on the main subjects in dispute, insisted only on three points-that the ^LMMresolution on the non-inevitability of war should be qualified by a statement to ^LwMWXwM                the effect that it depended on the victory of &quot;Socialism&quot;; that the word        I m^mt&quot; fractionalism &quot; should be omitted in the resolution on the subject; and that the ^LMMresolution on the &quot; cult of the personality&quot; should be amended.   They also ^LMMrefused to accept the draft on the role of the Soviet 20th and 21st Party Congresses, ^LMMwhich had been proposed by the Poles and Czechs and accepted by the majority.It was agreed, as in 1957, to produce a peace manifesto for the benefit ofnon-Communists as well as the ideological declaration. ^LwMThe Moscow Conference (10th November-lst December) ^LMM^LwM                      49.  The representatives of 81 parties attended the conference.   Of the ^LMM^LwM                significant parties only the Chinese, who were represented by Liu Shao-chi instead ^LMM^LwM                of Mao, the North Korean, Japanese, Italian and Indonesian Parties failed to ^LMMsend their leaders.  Before the conference the delegates were shown a Russian ^LMMletter, dated 5th November, in reply to the Chinese letter of 10th September. ^LMMWXWm 50.  The conference opened on 10th November with a brief speech of welcome        I W^mMby Khrushchev and a statement by Suslov that an agreed document had been ^LMM^LwM                produced by the preparatory commission, which had been unable to find a formula ^LwM^LwM                only on the few points listed above.  In fact, during the conference the Chinese ^LMM^LMM                re-opened all the old issues and it is clear that they did not regard themselves as ^LMM^LMM                bound to accept without further discussion the draft agreed by the preparatory ^LMM^LMM commission. It is likely that this attitude was caused by the Soviet action in ^LMMWXwM                circulating their 5th November letter, which constituted the most violent Soviet I^LwM                attack hitherto made on the Chinese position and entirely ignored the preparatory ^LMM^LMM                commission and the fact that it had secured agreement on most of the points in ^LMM51.  Suslov&apos;s report on the preparatory commission was followed immediately ^Mwl^LwM by Khrushchev&apos;s speech which, while firmly re-stating the Soviet case, was ^LMMMlMu                theoretical in tone and avoided recriminations with the Chinese. The temperature I^LwM                of the conference, which had to sit through interminable speeches by the delegates ^LMM^LwM                of the various parties largely on their own local problems, was raised on the 14th ^LMM^LwM                when Teng Hsiao-ping, the deputy head of the Chinese delegation, delivered am ^WjM^LwM                violent attack on the whole Soviet position, taking as his text the Soviet letter ^LMM^LwM                of 5th November, which he described as more important than the speeches of ^LwM^LwM Khrushchev and Suslov. On the 16th a profound shock was caused by the vulgar ^LMM^LwM                onslaught on the Soviet Union of the Albanian leader, Hoxha, whose relations       I W^mW^LwM                with Khrushchev were almost at breaking-point as a result of his discovery that ^LwMTOP SECRET-GUARD ^LW
1 TOP SECRET-GUARD 23^mmM the Russians were plotting his overthrow with members of the Albanian politburo ^L\\\and, according to his own account, with senior officers of the Albanian armed ^L\W^LWm forces. On the 23rd Khrushchev spoke again, although he had not intended to do W\\W^mmM so, in order to reply to the attacks of Teng Hsiao-ping and Hoxha.   On the^LWm conclusion of his speech he received a standing ovation with only the Chinese, ^L\W^L-M i Albanian and North Korean delegates remaining seated. ^L-W^L\\W m\        52.  During the first fortnight little was achieved except to give delegations an ^L\W^LmW opportunity for stating their position.  Broadly speaking it may be said that the ^L\W^L^W Soviet bloc and European Parties (with the exception of Albania) were solidly ^L-W^LmW pro-Khrushchev.  The same was true of the Latin-American Parties, despite the^^fl attention which China has paid to this area. While none of the Asian Parties (with^LWm the exception of the Chinese-dominated Malayan and Burmese Parties) came out ^L\W^LWm openly for China, they all showed to a greater or lesser extent their awareness of ^L\W^mmM the need to conciliate China, with the North Koreans, although a Soviet satellite, W\\W^mmM adopting a line which could almost be described as pro-Chinese. Outer Mongolia ^L\Wnaturally supported the Soviet Union, as did India, while North Vietnam was^LWm perhaps more successful than Indonesia in maintaining as strictly neutral an attitude ^L-M^LWm as possible. Both the Australian and New Zealand Parties, which have been under ^L-M^mmM I strong Chinese influence, went as far as they dared in support of China, and the ^L-W^L-M Japanese showed their acute embarrassment. ^L\W^mmm 53.  On the 24th the full sessions were suspended and the drafting commission ^L-W^LWM started its labours.  Despite Suslov&apos;s assurance that agreement had been reached aMWW^LWm on almost all points, the preparatory commission&apos;s draft declaration was submitted ^L-Mto detailed scrutiny and a large number of amendments incorporated. The Chinese^LWM proved co-operative until the points about which they felt strongly came under ^L-Mdiscussion, notably the references to the 20th and 21st Congresses of the Soviet Partyand &quot; fractionalism &quot;. Finally the drafting commission adjourned for its members ^L-W^LWm to reflect on these issues in informal discussion groups. In the meantime Ho Chi ^L-M^LWM Minh, the North Vietnamese leader, had set himself up as unofficial mediator ^L-Marranging for parties of delegates to interview Khrushchev and Liu Shao-chi, thehead of the Chinese delegation, separately. He now made a determined effort to ^L-M^mmM induce the two men to meet.   After some telephoning by Ho and a show ^L-WI of reluctance by Liu, they finally did so.  Their conversation lasted several hours ^L-W^mmW and a delay then ensued, presumably while the Chinese consulted Peking.  The ^L-M^LWM drafting commission had meanwhile been reconvened and soon got bogged down ^L-W^Lwm in discussing the difficulties which had been encountered by the sub-committee on ^L-M^Lwm colonial questions responsible for preparing the relevant paragraphs of the peace ^L-M^L-W manifesto.   It then turned its attention to the intractable question of Chinese ^L-W^L-W objections to the more important declaration. At this stage the meeting adjourned^L-W at the Chinese suggestion and they and the Russians went out together. When the ^L-W^L-M commission met on the following day to discuss the difficulties further, Suslov read ^L-M^L-M out a text of the disputed passages which had been agreed bilaterally between the ^L-M^L-M Chinese and Russians. This involved concessions by the Russians, which probably ^L-M^L-M included the omission of direct references to &quot; fractionalism&quot; and &quot; national ^L-M^L-M Communism &quot;.   It is unlikely that any political concessions were made to the ^L-W^L-W Chinese. ^L-W^L-W 54.  On 1st December the final plenary session of the conference was held. A^L-M good many of the delegates (including all the Albanians) had already left. The^L-W remainder heard anodyne speeches by Khrushchev and Liu Shao-chi (his first^L-W public intervention in the proceedings) and adopted the declaration and peace^L-W manifesto unanimously and without a vote.Developments Since the Moscow Conference^L-W 55.  Chinese actions during the past six months show how slight has been the^L-M practical effect of the nominal  agreement secured at Moscow. Chinese^L-M propaganda has avoided blatant attacks on the Soviet Union, although it still^L-M expresses the Chinese concept of Communism in the Maoist terminology to which^LWM   the Russians objected; and advantage was taken of the anniversary of the Paris^L-M Commune in March to restate, in more moderate language, the theories advanced^L-M in the Lenin Anniversary articles.   While China&apos;s lobbying of the worldH I Communist movement has certainly been more discreet since the Moscow^LWW Conference and members of her foreign service have apparently been instructed^L-W not to discuss the dispute with their Soviet bloc colleagues, opposition to the SovietTOP SECRET-GUARD
24 TOP SECRET-GUARDKne causes as much trouble as ever in the &quot; front organisations &quot;, and there is ? ^L-M^LWM              reason to believe that the Chinese envisage the possibility of another crisis arising WjMin their relations with the Soviet Union. Already, at a time when Soviet relations ^Lmmwith Albania are so strained that the Russians have effectively abandoned their ^LWwsubmarine base there and may have expelled Albania from the Warsaw Pact, ^L-Mthe Chinese are giving open diplomatic and economic support to the rebel. They ^L-Mhave found the foreign currency to buy Albania the wheat which she was refused ^LWwby the Russians; have undertaken to become Albania&apos;s main supplier of capital     ^L-Mgoods under her new Five-year Plan; and have openly defied Russia by endorsing mJMthe recent Albanian spy trial, which was understandably passed over in silence by ^LjmWthe Soviet bloc since the real charge against the accused seems to have been that ^mjM\^L%W.              of plotting Hoxha&apos;s overthrow with the Russians and not with the Yugoslavs and ^LWwGreeks as the prosecution alleged. ^LWM56.  China&apos;s obstinate refusal to come to even a temporary accommodation ^LjmW^LjmW              with the Russians is the more remarkable, since a new factor has been introduced ^mjXw^LjmW.               into the relationship by the serious food shortages in China.   In other respects mmmthe Chinese reaction has been realistic.   Despite her previous boasts of self- ^-^Lysufficiency, China has bought substantial amounts of Western wheat.  She has ^-^Lycut down capital investment, put the communes into abeyance and adopted policies ^-^Lywhich, by Chinese Communist standards, could be described as pampering the ^-^Lypeasants.   The regime has, however, drawn the line at conceding matters of ^-^Ly^-^Ly              Communist principle in order to attract effective Soviet aid. In these circumstances, ^-^Lythe Russian policy seems to have been to behave correctly and give the Chinese ^-^Lysuch assistance as they request, provided this does not involve substantial sacrifices ^-^Lyby the Soviet Union. Thus, the Russians have co-operated in marketing Chinese ^-^Lygold, granted China a moratorium on the large deficit in her current trading ^-^Ly^-^Ly account with the USSR and agreed to supply her with surplus Cuban sugar to berepaid at a later date in kind. They have not, however, granted the sterling loan ^-^Ly^^fl              which is what China really needs; the recent economic talks have concluded with ^-^LyW^M              a communique couched in such vague terms as to imply relative failure; nor have W^-wthe Soviet technicians returned to China in any numbers.  Soviet policy seems infact to be one of discreet but effective exploitation of China&apos;s economic weakness.I                                                 m HTOP SECRET-GUARD

(61)27 (Final)I  a     THE SOVIET AND CHINESE ATTITUDE TO DISARMAMENT ASW REVEALED BY SECRET REPORTSmJM The Russian position as revealed by secret documents may be summed up as mJMfollows.  Although the Russians probably recognise that general and completedisarmament may be unattainable as a short-term objective, they believe that thereWmM are advantages in continuing to press for it. Firstly because it is good propaganda. ^mm^mWM Not only does this &quot; militant appeal&quot; for disarmament help to represent the mwMCommunist world as being on the side of peace, but it makes it more difficult for mmmthe &quot; bellicose circles in the West&quot; to intensify the arms race.  Secondly there is^mWM the tactical aspect.  The Russians say that, whatever immediate results may be mJMWmW possible, if they do not fight now for general and complete disarmament they willnot be able to achieve it tomorrow. Whatever they may believe in their own minds^mWM about practical possibilities, the Russians have insisted in the meetings with other ^LWM^LWM Communist Parties that general and complete disarmament is a genuine goal, ^LWMand have disputed hotly the Chinese assertion that their long-term disarmament^mWM proposals are designed merely for propaganda. MXWM^LWM 2.  In particular they have stressed that the results of nuclear war aremmm unthinkable, and that the abolition of nuclear weapons will be very much in theinterest of the Socialist camp. To Chinese criticism that such a policy ifimplemented would be dangerous, they have pointed out that general and completedisarmament would not mean the abolition of all weapons, such as those necessaryfor the police. Moreover, with all national armies and weapons for internationalwar abolished there will be a better opportunity for national liberation movementsto overthrow their imperialist masters.I 3.  It seems reasonable to conclude from this evidence that as a short-termobjective the Russians would be prepared to go for an agreement for partialdisarmament which would be favourable to them and which the Socialist camp is.Strong enough politically and militarily to force on the West, helped by the supportof public opinion in the non-Communist world. Such an agreement could coverthe complete prohibition of nuclear weapons and the abolition of United Statesmilitary bases on foreign territory.4. The Chinese position in the party debate had been that, while they hadalways supported the Soviet proposals for disarmament, the idea of complete andgeneral disarmament was not only unrealistic but damaging to the fighting spiritof the anti-imperialist forces. They were however prepared to campaign for atotal prohibition of nuclear weapons, coupled perhaps with some measure ofconventional disarmament, and publicly to treat an agreement on these lines aspossible of achievement. (This carries the implication that they disapprove of atest ban in isolation.)5. As regards participation in negotiations for an agreement, whether for atest ban or for a disarmament agreement, the Chinese reaffirmed in privatediscussions the position which they took publicly in January 1960, viz.: &quot; Anyinternational disarmament agreement which is arrived at without the formalparticipation of the Chinese People&apos;s Republic and a signature of its delegateI cannot of course have any binding effect on China &quot;. At the inter-party discussions^mm which took place in Bucharest at the end of June the Chinese delegates charged^-m the USSR with adopting a proprietary attitude and attempting to act as spokesmanfor the Chinese Communists at international conferences such as the GenevaDisarmament Conference.  The Chinese Communist delegates warned &quot; that theUSSR could do this with other nations but that they could never act as a spokesmanV for Communist China&quot;.6. The final published statement of the Communist Parties (December 1960)contains a passage advocating universal and complete disarmament, together withan interim target &quot; to pave the way to general disarmament&quot;, and consisting of&quot; the banning of the testing and manufacture of nuclear weapons, the abolition ofTOP SECRET-GUARD
mum MW &apos;mmm26 TOP SECRET  G ARD &apos;WMmilitary blocs and war bases on foreign soil and a substantial reduction of armed^mm forces and armaments &quot;.   The relative emphasis on partial measures does not^mm correspond with the main emphasis of Soviet propaganda from March 1960 ^-Monwards (which has supported &quot; complete and general &quot; disarmament), though itM^M has received some rather tenuous confirmation in hints from the Polish delegation^-m to the United Nations, which have indicated that the Russians might be preparedto settle for a partial agreement. In the accompanying &quot; Appeal to the Peoples of ^ Ithe World&quot;, disarmament is represented as something to be imposed on the T Iimperialists by struggle rather than as a mutually beneficial arrangement to bebrought about by mutual concessions.   In sum therefore the Russian line on^-^L\ disarmament was endorsed by the assembled Communist Parties, with certain^-m modifications of presentation designed to appease Chinese doubts.  The crucialquestion of Chinese participation in negotiations was not mentioned.I   ITOP SECRET-GUARD  &apos; fljTj I
