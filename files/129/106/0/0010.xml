SECRET54BALANCE OF PAYMENTS TRENDSNote by the Acting Chairman of the EconomicSteering (General) CommitteeThe attached Report of the Balance of Payments TrendsWorking Party has been considered by the Economic Steering Committe2. The Committee endorsed the conclusions of the Report andlaid particular emphasis on the following points:-(i) &apos;     The unfavourable balance of payments is a reflection ofthe excess of home demand over available domestic resources.   Thefact that we are drawing on production abroad by running a large deficit,and that thi3 is coupled with an abnormally low level of unemployment at home, is an indication of the extent to which domestic demandexceeds the productive capacity available.(ii) The pressure of demand should be checked at once and thereafter held at a consistently lov/er level in relation to productivecapacity.   By running the economy under less pressure, we can hope to maintain a steadier pace.   When we have applied restraints inthe past we have always relaxed toosoonand allowed pressure tobecome excessive again.   If we follow a consistent policy now whileworld trade is buoyant, we have an opportunity of making up some ofthe ground we have lost in relation to other countries.(iii) All the advantages of reducing the pressure of demand would however, be thrown away if we allowed a rise in wage and other coststo destroy our competitive position.   We are most likely to be able tocontrol costs if we restrain demand.(Signed)   THOMAS PADMORE17th July, 1961
2.     We have now undertaken a general survey of the trend of theUnited Kingdom balance of payments over the last ten years andhave considered the prospects over the next few years.   In accord-ance with our remit, we have given special attention to the past and future development of the invisible account.   We have also considered the general remedial action which appears to us to be needed.   Although we have not completed our work and have still toconsider whether we should recommend specific steps to improve theposition on invisible or long-term capital account, we felt it wou]be useful to present a first report indicating in broad terms the findings we have already made; leaving the question of specificremedies for a later report.   Wo felt this particularly becausethe short-term prospects, both for the balance of payments andfor the internal economy, appeared to require vigorous and rapidaction, and it seemed to us that the results of our deliberationswere relevant to both the kind and the scale of the action required.3.     This first report takes the following form:Part I: deals with the past and prospective trend of thebalance of visible trade;Part II:       contains the results of our examination of theinvisible account   (This section is rather fullerand more detailed than tho rest,  since wo were askedto pay special attention to this part of thobalance of payments);Part III:      deals with past and prospective developments in thelong-term capital account;Part IV:       brings together the results of our examination in asummary of tho likely trend of the balance of payments as a whole over the next few years,Part V: covers tho development of tho balance of payments inthe recent past and immediate future;Part VI:       diagnoses the causes of imbalance;Part VII:      gives our views on the remedial action needed; and part VIII:    is a summary.1&apos;    FIRST REPORT PIT THE WORKING PARTY ON--balance op payubhts trends-introduction.     The Working Party on Balance of Payments Trends was set upin accordance with a decision of the Economic Steering (General)Committee at its meeting on 13th April, 1961 - E.S.Gi(6l)3rd Meeting, Item 1.   Its terms of reference were:To examine the major elements in the balance of payments,with special reference to the invisible account, to identifytrends and to consider suggestions for remedial action,reporting back to the Economic Steering (General) Committee.
ftk.     Before embarking on our analysis we should explain our choice of period.    Our balance of payments has been subject to wide andfrequent fluctuations, and one of the chief tasks of the working party was to establish whether the deterioration of 1959 and 1960was a temporary phenomenon, which might right itself of its own accord, or whether we faced an underlying trend of imbalance.   Inorder to try to assess the trend, shorn of the fluctuations, we have examined the figures over the last nine years from 1952 to 1960.   it seemed to us that it would not be helpful to go further back intopast history; 19 51 - the year in which the Korean war made a very heavy impact on our balance of payments - was quite exceptional; andin the period before that the aftermath of world war made conditionsso dissimilar from those now prevailing that comparison   would beirrelevant.5.     We should also mention that the figures we have used for theperiod 1952 to 1957 are, in principle, calculated on the same basis as, and therefore broadly comparable with, the latest publishedbalance of payments statistics for 1958 to 1960.    (Cmnd. 1329).These figures for 1952 to 1957 have not been made public and differconsiderably from the published figures for those years.Part I:    Visible Trade6.     It is no easy matter to distinguish the trend of our visiblebalance from its fluctuations.   Disregarding for the moment changesin the terms of trade, the curve of imports is influenced by changesin economic activity at home, including investment, the ups and downsof stock-building, changes in the pressure of demand and alterations in the degree of control exercised over imports.   The curve of exports seems to follow more closely the trend of demand in our principal markets, but is of course also affected by the developmentof economic activity in the United Kingdom.   We have found nocompletely satisfactory way of eliminating these fluctuating elements in order to assess the underlying trend of our visible trade.   Thebest method we could adopt was to take the three years at thebeginning of our period and the three years at the end of the period,and compare them.   Economic circumstances had a good deal in common in each group of years,  though possibly stock-building tookplace on a greater scale in the more recent group.7.     Table 1 bolow gives the key figures in value terms;Table 1 - Visible Trade(Balance of payments basis)Actual prices  million1952-54 average    1958-60 average Change(improvement +)Imports 2,953 3,662 -   709Exports 2,736 3,537 -4   801Visible deficit 217 124 4-93The visible deficit on a balance of payments basis fell from 217 million a year in 1952-54 to  124 million a year in 1958-60.Imports rose in value by  700 million and exports rose by  800 million.2
oVolume and prices8.     We cannot, however, deduce from the favourable change in thesefigures a trend which could safely be projected forward.   The volumeof imports rose more than the volume of exports, and there was asubstantial improvement in our terms of trade.   This is shown inTable 2 below:Table 2 - Volume and prices:  (195*4- = 100)1952-54 average   1958-60 average     PercentageChangeImportsVolume	97	125	+ 28Price	104	99	-   5Exports			Volume	96	117	* 22Price	102	110	*   8Terms of Trade	102	90	12(better)Between the two periods the volume of imports increased &quot;by28 per cent, hut their price fell by 5 per cent.   The volume of exports increased by 22 per cent and their price increased by8 per cent.    The terms of trade improved by about 12 per cent.9.     Another way of analysing the trend of our imports and exports,which is also helpful in looking forwards, is to relate them both to national income.    Table 3 below shows imports and exports at constant (1954) prices on a balance of payments basis as a propor-tion of Gross Domestic Product (G.D.P.) at constant prices:Table 3 - Imports and exports as a percentageof G.D.P.1952-54 average    1958-60 average     CnangoImports 19-0 21.4 4-2.4Exports 17.8 18.6 +0.8In short, imports grew more quickly than exports in relation toG.D.P., and the gap between them, as a proportion of G.D.P.,increased.    An increasing absorption of imports was a tendency weshared with most other industrialised countries in Europe.10.    It will be plain from the foregoing that,  before arriving atany conclusion about the future, wo have to consider the likelytrend of the volume of our imports and exports in relation toG.D.P. and the likely development of our terms of trade.Prospects for imports11.    Imports of industrial materials have increased in the pastdecade at about the same rate as industrial production and only alittle faster than G.D.P.    Wo may expect this relation to persist.Imports of food, beverages and tobacco have risen faster thanconsumer expenditure on food, but much of the difference occurred in the first half of the decade, and was probably associated withdecontrol.    A further part was due to a more recent increase in imports of feodingstuffs, which is not expected to continue at
same rate.   Imports of food, drink and tobacco may, therefore,increase .in future no fastor than consumer expenditure on similaritems and probably not so fast as G.D.P.12.   Imports of finished manufactures (capital equipment and consumer goods) have increased sharply during the period and nowmeet a higher proportion of total demand than in 1952, as v/CII asaccounting for a bigger share of our total imports.   This is in line with development in other industrialised countries.   The greaterpart of the increase in United Kingdom imports of finished manufacturers has been in capital equipment for industry; two-thirds of the increase between 1952-54 and 1958-60 was in engineering products and metal manufactures.   The share of imports in homoinvestment in plant and machinery has been increasing.   The increasein imports of consumer goods, while great as a percentage - havingstarted from a very low restricted level, is small in absolute terms and as a proportion of total imports. Nevertheless the import content of consumer expenditure has been rising, partly as a result of liberalisation and partly as a result of consumers enjoying higherincomes seeking a wider range of choice, even where imported goodsshowed no price advantage.    Generally these trends may be expectedto continue and imports of finished manufactures may continue torise faster than the G.D.F.13.    Oil accounts for a substantial part of the rise in our totalimports, the rate of oil imports having increased between throe and four times as fast as G.D.P.    This is partly due to the rise in fuel consumption generally but oven more to the switch from coal to oil.   As this has been happening elsewhere it has resulted not onlyin a net reduction in our domestic demand for coal but also in our export sales of coal.   These trends also nay be expected to continue.14.    It therefore seems likely that total imports will continueto rise, probably at a higher rate than the increase in G.D.P., butthat the disparity in rates may be less than hitherto.Prospects for exports15.    Exports,  on the other hand, though higher in relation toG.D.P. in the last than in the first years of the period,  showed no clear and persistent trend of increase in relation to G.D.P., as theyhave done in other major European industrialised countries.   Therehave been substantial changes in both the composition and thedirection of our exports.    Engineering products and rietals nowaccount for 58 per cent of our exports, compared with 51 per cent at the beginning of the period; exports of engineering productshaving increased by 50 per cent,  compared with a 30 per cent increase in total exports.    It looks as if it is in engineering products that world trade will be most buoyant in the years ahead.By contrast textiles accounted for less than 9 per cent of our total exports in 1953-60 compared with 14 per cent in 1952-54, havingdeclined absolutely in the period, while cod exports, which beforethe war accounted for 8 per cent of our total exports, declined by two thirds in the period and now account for less than 1 per cent.16.    Anile this shift in the commodity pattern of our exports hasbeen taking place, there has also been an important change in therelative importance of our major overseas markets.    Our exportsto the Rest of the Sterling Area (R.S.A.) increased by only12 per cent between 1952-54 and 1858-60,  compared with the30 per cent increase in total exports.   Moreover the R.S.A.countries now take just over 40 per cent of the total compared withjust under 50 per cent in the earlier period.    This is partly4
Tile same rate.    Imports of food, drink and tobacco may, therefore,increase .in future no faster than consumer expenditure on similaritems and probably not so fast as G.D.P.12.   Imports of finished manufactures (capital equipment and consumer goods) have increased sharply during the period and howmoot a higher proportion of total demand than in 1952, as well asaccounting for a bigger share of our total imports.    This is in line with development in other industrialised countries.    The greaterpart of the increase in United Kingdom imports of finished manufacturers has been in capital equipment for industry; two-thirds of the increase between 1952-54 and 1958-60 was in engineering products and metal manufactures.    The share of imports in homeinvestment in plant and machinery has been increasing.   The increasein imports of consumer goods, while great as a percentage - havingstarted from a very low restricted level, is small in absolute terms and as a proportion of total imports. Nevertheless the import content of consumer expenditure has been rising, partly as a result of liberalisation and partly as a result of consumers enjoying higherincomes seeking a wider range of choice, even where imported goodsshowed no price advantage.    Generally these trends may be expectedto continue and imports of finished manufactures may continue torise faster than the G.D.P.13.    Oil accounts for a substantial part of the rise in our totalimports, the rate of oil imports having increased between three and four times as fast as G.D.P.    This is partly due to the rise in fuel consumption generally but oven more to the switch from coal to oil.   As this has been happening elsewhere it has resulted not onlyin a net reduction in our domestic demand for coal but also in our export sales of coal.    These trends also may be expected to continue.14.    It therefore seems likely that total imports will continueto rise, probably at a higher rate than the increase in G.D.P., butthat the disparity in rates may be less than hitherto.Prospects for exports15.   Exports, on the other hand, though higher in relation toG.D.P. in the last than in the first years of the period,  showed no clear and persistent trend of increase in relation to G.D.P., as theyhave done in other major European industrialised countries.    Therehave been substantial changes in both the composition and thedirection of our exports.   Engineering products and metals nowaccount for 58 per cent of our exports, compared with 51 per cent at the beginning of the period; exports of engineering productshaving increased by 50 per cent, compared with a 30 per cent increase in total exports.    It looks as .if it is in engineering products that world trade will be most buoyant in the years ahead.By contrast textiles accounted for loss than 9 per cent of our total exports in 1958-60 compared with 14 per cent in 1952-54, havingdeclined absolutely in the period, while coal exports, which beforethe war accounted for 8 per cent of our total exports, declined by two thirds in the period and now account for less than 1 per cent.16.    i/Vhile this shift in the commodity pattern of our exports hasbeen taking place, there has also been an important change in therelative importance of our major overseas markets,    Our exportsto the Rest of the Sterling Area; (R.S.A.) increased by only-12 per cent between 1952-54 and 1858-60,  compared with the30 per cent increase in total exports.   Moreover the R.S.A.countries now take just over kO per cent of the total compared withjust under 50 per cent in the earlier period.    This is partly4
&quot;ocause their imports have boon rising at a less rapid rate thanworld trade as a whole and partly because the United Kingdom shareof their total imports has boon declining.   This decline seems likelyto continue, although possibly at a slower rate&quot; than in recent years.The most rapid rate of increase in our exports has been in exportsto North America, whore wo havo increased our share of the market.In Western Europe our exports have increased by 30 per cent,whereas, the total imports of O.E.E.C. countries, including theirintra-trade, increased by more than 60 per cent.    But more recentlyour performance has improved markedly.    It is broadly true that our exports are increasingly going to the more rapidly expanding markets of North American and Western Europe and to a decreasing extent tothe less promising markets in the R.S.A.17.   Major shifts of this kind take place rather slowly.    But asa result of these changes in commodity composition and geographical distribution and because of the measures taken to assist exportsas part of the export drive, it is reasonable to expect under conditions of expanding world trade that our exports should increase at a rather faster rate than in the past.   Movements in the terms oftrade could also have a significant effect on our exports.    If theterms of trade of primary producers ceased to deteriorate, we might expect a larger increase in their demand for imports than in thepast.    But without groat changes in the home economy there seems noreason to expect that the ratio of exports to the G.D.P. will increase appreciably.Terms of trade18.    The total effect of the favourable change in our terms oftrade over the last decade upon the balance of trade cannot be measured.   We paid less and earned more per unit of imports and exports respectively, and that was a direct gain.    But there must also have been an indirect loss - through the stimulus to ourdemand for imports and the check to the demand for our exports.The effect of lower import prices (mainly in the field of primary products) on our demand for imports is not thought to have beenvery significant, but the effect on the demand for our exports ofthe fall in the prices of primary products and therefore of incomes in primary producing countries,  together with the rise in our export prices, may have:been considerable.    We cannot measure the totaleffect of those complex relationships, but there is little doubtthat there was a net benefit to our balance of trade.19.    This is a field in which it is especially difficult to discernwhat the future trend is likely to be.    There is some ground forthinking that the course of import prices may bo moderately upwards.More commodities have come under some form of price support orproduction control, and for others the margin between the currentlyrising demand and potential supply may be getting less.   If worldindustrial production continues to grow quickly commodity prices maymove up somewhat.    There is little expectation of a general increasein the price of foodstuffs, but imports of finished manufactureswill probably rise in price much in line with our domestic prices.20.   Although competition will restrain incroo.sos in our export prices, it seems only realistic to assume that continuing expansionof output in the manufacturing countries will be accompanied bysome measure of cost and price inflation, which will be reflected in export prices.5
I t   1 -21.    On balance we do not expect the improvement in the terms oftrade over the last ten years to be maintained.    It would certainlybo unwise to count upon a continuation of tho past very favourabletrend.Prospects for visible balance22.    Our analysis suggests that imports as a proportion of G.D.P.will continue to rise, although the rate of increase may be a little less rapid than in the past.    There seems no reason to expect the ratio of exports to G.D.P. to increase appreciably.    The terms oftrade do not seem likely to continue to move in our favour as theyhave done hitherto.   In sum, therefore, although there will befluctuations from year to year as in the past, if present policiescontinue unchanged, there is nothing in tho situation we haveanalysed that would lead us to think that within the next few years the visible trade deficit, which has characterised our balance ofpayments almost every year   since the beginning of the century,will be greatly changed.
fK Part II;    Invisible Account3.    A surplus of invisible earnings has been a normal feature ofUnited Kingdom&apos;s balance of payments throughout the present centuryand probably for many years before that.    Its chief componentswere our income from tho massive overseas investment of the nineteenth century and from carrying a high proportion of world trade in our ships.    Our imports had overtaken our exports beforethe turn of the century, and it was this surplus of invisibleearnings which enabled us to run a visible deficit and to meet thenet cost of continuing to invest overseas.   In the immediate pre-war years our surplus of invisible earnings was probably in the region of  300 million a year.    Although we had to liquidate a large partof our most valuable overseas investments during the war and ended the war with a substantial reduction in our merchant fleet, thoseearnings grew again rapidly after the war, and by the early 1950&apos;shad reached a not level of about  300 million.24.    In the period of our examination,  1952 to 1960, net invisiblereceipts declined once more and all but disappeared.    65 million of this deterioration occurred between 1952 and 1958, but the major part between 1958 and 1960.    Table 4 below gives a summary analysis of what occurred;Table 4 - Invisible transactions (net)  millionGovernment	1952	1958	1960	1952-60	-194	-225	-287	- 93Shipping	136	22	- 25	-161Oil profits	182	252	18k	4-    other interest, profits and				dividends	74	9	-   5	- 79Travel	-   3	- 17	- 17	- IkOther items	96	185	172	+ 16Total +291    4-226   4- 22 -269Excluding Defence Aid, which amounted to  137 million in 1952 and  3 million in 1958.We consider the components of this table in turn in the following sections.Government expenditure25.

26.    Government expenditure increased from  222 million in 1952 to 332 million in 1960.    Government receipts rose by  17 million,chiefly as a result of higher expenditure by United States and canadian forces in this country.   The net increase in governmentoverseas expenditure was therefore  93 million.   Although grantsincreased by  19 million - mostly at the end of the period - andalthough there was a steady increase in expenditure on representation,pensions and international subscriptions, the main increase, of 75 million,  came in military expenditure.27&apos;.   Military.   Military expenditure expanded from  140 million to 215 million between 1952 and 1960.    The largest single cause ofthis increase was the assumption by II.M. Government over the last five years of the greater part of the cost of the United kingdom forces in Germany.   Before 1955 our forces there were no charge onthe balance of payments; by 1960 net expenditure in Germany was nearly  50 million.   Military expenditure elsewhere was at a leveltrend in the aggregate up to 1959, but in 1960 there was a sharpincrease.   Apart from the general effect of the rises in forces&apos; paygranted in April, 1960, policy decisions led us to incur heavy expendi-ture on capital works in East Africa and Aden.28.   Military expenditure will rise in 1961,  on account of the ending of German support costs and as a result of revaluation of theDeutschenark, by about  15 million.    Over the next few years, littlefurther change is likely,  though there are a number of possibilitieswhich could upset this expectation.29.    Grants.    The period 1952-58 saw no striking changes in thelevel of grant assistance to territories overseas, though there was some growth over the period.    The 19*4-5 Colonial Development andY/elfare Act led by 1952 to a level of CD. &amp; W. grant expenditure which subsequently grew little - in fact by about  5 million up to1958-59.   Although the Montreal Conference had little immediate impact on grant expenditure, the climate of opinion established, togetherwith the increased emphasis on the need to help the emergentColonies to prepare themselves economically for independence, wasreflected in a rather faster rate of expansion of grants to such countries after 1958.    In the past two years assistance in the formof larger contributions to the United Nations Special Fund and other international organisations also increased.    Grants for military purposes were virtually unchanged and total grants grew in all from 50 million in 1952 to  69 million in 1960.30.   Expenditure under the Overseas Services Aid Scheme begins thisyear and other grant expenditure has been rising.   Ministers havedecided, however, that total aid expenditure (covering loans as wellas grants) should be stabilised within a range of  190- 20O million per annum, unless the balance of payments improves.    Taking accountof this, we should expect that the increase in aid expenditure byway of grant would be limited to some  20 million over the nextfew years.31.   As to the Governments current expenditure and receipts as awhole, there seems little prospect of improvement over the comingyears, indeed net expenditure may slightly increase, unless present policies change.Shipping32.    Our gross payments and receipts in respect of shipping aregiven in Table 6 below18SEC KIT
Table 6;    Shipping  millionChange1952    1958    1960     1952-60Debits;	440	615	669	- 229Credits?	576	637	644	4-   68Net	+ 136	4-22	-25	- 16133.    The shipping account deteriorated over the period 1952-60,and instead of a net credit of  136 million in 1952 there was anet deficit of at least  25 million, and probably rather more, in1960.    This is some 4 per cent of total debits.    The main factors.in this decline are summarised below.34.    Freights paid to foreign shipping on dry cargo imports rosemore than freights earned on our exports and in the cross-trades.The expansion in the carrying capacity of the United Kingdom fleet was out-stripped by the expansion of United Kingdom trade(particularly imports) and by that of foreign fleets.    This in turnappears to bo primarily because United Kingdom shipowners were unable or unwilling to expand in the same way as many of their foreign competitors, both traditional and now.    It is also possiblethat the relative i)vofitability of capital in alternative employmentsin the United Kingdom was higher than that ruling in the domesticmarkets of some foreign maritime powers.35.    The shipping account of all maritime countries was hit to someextent by the reduction in the earning power of shipping since 1957owing to the world surplus of tonnage.    This was accompanied by arise in the cost of disbursements abroad - for fuel, port and canal dues, etc.   Net earnings were thus squeezed at both ends.36.    Charter payments to foreign tanker-owners increased between three and four times between 1952 and 1960, but the gross earnings ofthe United Kingdom tanker fleet increased by little more than a thirdover that period.    This is because the tonnage of United Kingdomtankers did not increase proportionately with the increase in thevolume of oil movements carried out by United Kingdom oil companies.The companies normally aim to provide some two fifths of theirtonnage requirements in their own vessels,  chartering the remainderfrom independent owners; of these charters some 80-90 per cent arenow filled by foreign tankers.    The heavy volume of tonnagechartered at very high rates during the Suez period had a very marked affect in this field, where British shipowners missed overthe period exceptionally profitable opportunities.37.    For example, some ten or twelve years ago the United Kingdomoil companies invited our shipping firms to build tankers withcharters fixed in advance to the oil companies from 5-7 years aheadat rates enabling them to write off most of the capital cost duringthe life of a charter.   Most of our shipowners w^-re not prepared toaccept this business.    Other owners, o.g., Greek and Norwegian,stepped in and the tanker tonnage built by them at that time proved to be a most profitable proposition.    The profits ma.de were retained for further enlargement of the fleets of these countries.38.   United Kingdom shipowners are at no serious disadvantage on costs.    Capital charges account for about half the total costs of modern tonnage, and British owners are free to build abroa,d when9
Pb suits then.    Crew costs are nuch lower than those in. U.S.A.or Canada and generally in line with nost European countries.    the passenger trades have been hit to some extent by competition from theair and also from some foreign owners who can exercise greater croweconomies; but this item in the account has in fact improved.39.   The shipping industry itself tends to emphasise the adverse effects of flag discrimination, foreign subsidies, taxation andflags of convenience.   None of these can be quantified.    The directeffect on our shipping receipts of flag discrimination and subsidiesby foreign governments has boon serious in some trades, but the overall result appears so far to have been marginal.    Taxation,with depreciation allowances based on historic rather than replace-ment costs, was certainly heavy in the earlier years compared withthat borne by some of the industry&apos;s foreign competitors, particularly those operating under flags of convenience.   Much of the rapid expansion of flag of convenience fleets was achieved on credit, toan extent that does not appear to have been matched by Britishshipowners at that tine.    Since 1957, with the 40 per cent InvestmentAllowance and the fall in profits, the united Kingdom shipping industry has on the whole been at no significant disadvantagecompared even with the flag of convenience owners.   Nevertheless, all those factors taken together have no doubt had a disproportionateeffect on the confidence of British shipowners in their competitivefuture and have thus materially contributed to their caution in tonnage expansion.    These issues are under examination by a Sub-Comnittee of the Economic Policy Committee under lord Mills.40.   As to the future, other things being equal, the dry cargoshipping account should improve slowly on balance as the world tonnagesurplus is reduced and in particular as liner operations become more profitable.   But this is unlikely to have any marked effectbefore the end of 1962, and in any case would be counter-balancedif there wore much further rise in the volume of imports, which would increase our reliance on foreign tonnage.    The tanker account islikely to deteriorate further until 1963, when the peak level forcharter payments contracted in the Suez   period will be passed.After 1963 there may be some improvement in the shipping accountas a whole, but it is difficult to give any worthwhile indication of its extent.Oil profits41.    The contribution of the United Kingdom oil companies to ourinvisible earnings is shown in Table 7 below;Table 7	- Oil	profits			1952	1958	  1960	million Change 1952-60Debits; Credits s	43 225	84 336	47 231	-     4 *     6Net	+ 182	h-252	+ 184	4-       242.    The net earnings from tho overseas operations of theUnited Kingdom oil companies now provide a very large part of ournet invisible receipts.    These earnings rose from about  180 million in 1952 to  250 million or so in 1958, falling away to a little over 180 million in 1960.    Earnings in 1958 were somewhat exceptional.10S    C* ii*l     li
In 1955 and 1956 they were reduced by heavy payments of &quot;backroyalties and tax (associated with the 50-50 profit sharing arrange-ments) and the major impact of the Suez   crisis was then felt.In other years oil earnings fluctuated within a range of about 170-200 million.43.   The relative stability of oil profits over the period isdifficult to explain, in view of the regular investment by theUnited Kingdom oil industry of some  100 million per year abroad.Part of the explanation may lie in the inadequacy of the statisticsfor the years before 1958.    Since 1958 a situation of oversupply has developed and competition has become severe; the internationalmarket has been depressed by the entry of newcomers, including theRussians.    Although tho volume of business done is expected toincrease rapidly with world consumption of oil, tho margin of profitis not expected to rise over the nearer future and very littleincrease in net earnings can bo foreseen.Interest profits and dividends (other than oil)44.    Our payments and receipts on account of interest, profits and dividends, excluding the oil industry, are shown in Table 8belowtTable- Interest, profits and dividends(other than oiljChange	1952	1958	1960	1952-60Debits t	218	331	408	- 190Credits;	292	340	403	+ 111Net	+ 74	*   9	-   5	-   7945.    The striking feature of this table is that when the oil industryis left on one side the income we receive by way of interest,profits and dividends on all our other overseas investments nolonger exceeds the income we pay to overseas residents on theirinvestments in the United Kingdom.    The deterioration of about 80 million in the net balance, was the result of a large upward movement in both debits and credits.    Payments increased from 218 million in 1952 to  408 million in I960 and receipts from 292 million in 1952 to  403 million xn 1960.    The income we paidabroad grew more rapidly than the income we received from abroad;46.    On the debit side the largest increase was in direct invest-ment earnings in the United Kingdom, half of which are re-invested,here.    The heavy rate of direct investment in recent years by theU.S.A. and Canada in this country has made a considerable contribu-tion to the increased debits under this hea,d.    Interest on overseassterling holdings rose by some  70 million during the period,partly as a result of the increase in sterling holdings but mainly .because of the increase in interest rates.    On the credit sidethe largest change was in income from direct and portfolio invest-ment, which increased by nearly  90 million between 1952 and 1960.47.   Looking to the future, large changes in portfolio investmentincome are not expected, but in continuation of past trends weforesee a larger rate of increase in payments to overseas residentson their direct investments in the United Kingdom than in receipts
&quot;By United Kingdom residents from their investments of this typeabroad. In absolute terms however, the latter increase may be the bigger.    Both sides of the account may be affected by a decision onjoining the Common Market.    If the present level of interest rates,which is somewhat below that ruling in 1960, continues, the billfor interest on overseas sterling holdings should be slightly lower.    Interest on Government debt to North America will continuevirtually unchanged over the next few years, but there may be some increase in interest receipts, provided recipients of loan aidunder the aid programme are not permitted any relief from theservice of this debt.    In this sector of the invisibles account asa whole we may hope for a small improvement by say 1963.Travel48. Table 9 below shows our expenditure and receipts on travel,including business travel;Table 9   -   Travel  million		1958		Change	1952		1960	1952-60Debits s	83	155	205	- 122Creditsi	80	138	188	+ 108Net	-   3	- 17	- 17	-   1449.    The development of tourist travel has led to large increases in our payments and our receipts, both having just about kept pace with one another.   Debits increased from  83 million in 1952 to 205 million in 1960, mainly in Western Europe.    Credits in the sameperiod increased from  80 million to  188 million, mainly from north America and the R-.S.A&quot;.    The net cost of overseas travelaccordingly rose from  3 million in 1952 to  17 million in 1960.    Itmust be expected that both sides of this account will continue tomove upward, and we do not think that the net balance over the comingyears will be very different from what it was last year.Other items50.    Table 10 below covers the remaining items in the invisibleaccount %Table 10   -   Other itemsChange	1952	1958	1960	1952-60Debits?	295	374	433	- 138Credits %	391	559	605	-f 214Net	+ 96	+ 185	+ 172	4-   7651.    These figures include migrants&apos; funds, civil aviation, theexpenditure of United States and Canadian forces on private account in the United Kingdom, insurance,  commission, royalties, the12
expenditure of foreign government and students, certain City earnings and so on.   We have little accurate knowledge of many of these itemsand estimation of them must he very tentative.    In sum they produced a net receipt of nearly  100 million in 1952 and this had expanded to just over  170 million by 1960.   Earnings from civil aviationhave been expanding and will likely do so in the future, as mayearnings from insurance.    On the other hand the expenditure ofUnited States and Canadian forces here may be somewhat lower on accountof the economy measures of the United States Administration.   We see no reason to expect any significant change in the outcome of thispart of the invisible account in the near future.The invisible account as a whole52.    Of the large and striking fall in our net invisible receiptsbetween 1952 and 1960, much the larger part took place between 1958and 1960, and there now seems to be a tendency for the figures tolevel off.    Shipping, Government expenditure and interest on the sterling balances may bo singled out as the largest contributors tothe decline, though, of course, the net figures for other interest,profits and dividends, which changed little, comceal very large increases in both debits and credits.53-    Over the next few yee.rs wo expect there to bo some further deterioration on Government expenditure and on shipping, not entirelyoffset by some relief on interest, profits and dividends and oilearnings.   looked at another way, net earnings of some  300 million on private account are absorbed by Government expenditure ofapproximately the same amount.   Unless major decisions are taken,there is little prospect of the Governments expenditure fallingsignificantly.   Although it is impossible to discern the future trend of the invisible account with any certainty, we see no prospectwhatever of our net receipts returning over the next few years to thelevel they attained in the early 1950&apos;s.    The most likely prospectis that they will fluctuate around their present negligible level.
Part III;   Long-term capital account54. The main figures for the whole long-term capital account are brought together in Table 11 below;Table 11	- Long-	-term	capital	(net)	1952	1958	1960	Change 1952-60Inter-Government loans	-	-45	-91	-91Other Offical	- 19	- k	+ 1	+20I.D.A. etc.	-	-	-10	-10Privat e inve stment	-120	-130	-101	*19Total	-139	-179	-201	-62  millionThese net figures are the result of large flows in both directions,which to a considerable extent offset one another.    The moreimportant sections are analysed below on a gross basis.Inter-Government loans55.    The year 1952 marked a turning point for new lending, bothby &quot;and to the United Kingdom.    In the immediate post-war years wehad received assistance amounting to some  1,600 million,principally from the United State s of America, Canada and India;in the same period we had given assistance by way of loans to theextent of nearly  300 million, mainly to Western Europe.    In 1952itself loan repayments and new loans by the United Kingdom wereoffset by new loans received, mainly from the United States ofAmerica.56.    Table 12 below shows the development from 1952 to 1960:Table 12 - Inter-Government loans  million	1952	1958	1960	Change 1952-60New Loans; By United Kingdom To United Kingdom	- 6 4-26	-22	-61	-55 -26Repayments; By United Kingdom To United Kingdom	-42 4-22	-60 4-37	-72 4-42	-30 4-20Total (net)	-	-45	-91	-9157.   Between 1952 and 1958 there was a slow upward trend in newlending by the United Kingdom.   At the Commonwealth EconomicConference at Montreal in 1958 H.M.G, announced its intention tointroduce a new policy of Commonwealth assistance loans from government funds to meet the growing demands for development in
the less developed countries when political developments in thesecountries were beginning to close the London market to them.    Thiswas reflected in a striking rise in new lending by H.M.G., both byway of Exchequer loans to Colonial territories and by way of loansunder Section 3 of the Exports Credits Guarantees Act of 1949 to independent Commonwealth countries.   By 1960 new lending by H.M.G,had risen to  61 million from  22 million in 1958,   Between thesame years, hovrever, borrowing in the London market by commonwealth countries as a whole decreased by nearly  30 million, so that thenet extra charge on the balance of payments was little over 10 million.58.    As to the future, the recent decision of Ministers to stabilise the development aid programme (covering both grants and loans) at 190-200 million annually, until the balance of payments improves,and commitments already entered into would imply that new lendingby H.M.G. would soon reach  90 million - an increase of nearly 30 million over last year&apos;s figure.59.    The net burden of loan repayment has not varied a great deal.On the debit side, costing some  45-60 million annually, the chiefliability has been the repayment of the North American loans.   Loanrepayments received have usually been in the range of  20-35 million,mainly from Western Europe.   Net repayments by the united Kingdomamounted to  23 million in 1958 and&apos; 30 million in 1.960,    Theincrease between 1958 and 1960 is accounted for by the redemptionof debt incurred in the European Payments Union, offset by smallerfavourable changes on account of other items.60.    This part of the account should show some improvement from now on.    The North American loan service will be with us until theyear 2000.   Redemption payments on the European Payments Union debt,however, will be much reduced.    The recent high rate of lending to countries in the R.S.A. should bring a small rise in receipts byway of repayment, provided there is no easing of the presentconditions of repayment - probably an optimistic assumption.    Onthis basis in a few years time the net cost of loan repaymentsmight be some  10 million a year less than in 1960,Private investment61.    The statistics of private investment in the earlier years, andin particular their breakdown, are not reliable.   Although the nettotal of private investment of all kinds appears to have changedrelatively little, there has been a considerable expansion of grossinvestment inward and outward, which led to this outcome.    This isshown in Table 13 belowsTable 13 - Private investment  million1952     1958     1960     Change. 1952-6OAbroad -223     -323     -274       -51In United Kingdom +103     4-193     +173      +70Net       -120     -130     -101       +1915
62.    These figures are very difficult to interpret because they include disinvestment as well as investment in both directions,since the statistics are not available prior to 1958 on a grossbasis and distinguishing direct from portfolio investment.    when allowance is made for the apparently abnormal rate of privatedisinvestment by the United Eangdom in 1960, it is probable thatgross outward private investment had risen substantially - perhapsby a half compared with 1952.    A large part of this increase wasin investment overseas by the oil industry.    Private disinvestmentin the United Kingdom may also have been somewhat higher than usualin 1960, which would imply that gross investment by overseasresidents in the United Kingdom grew somewhat more between 1952and 1960 than the figures in Table 13 would suggest.    It isdifficult to attribute the upswing in both directions to specificcauses.    It is probably to be associated with the world-widegrowth of economic activity dxiring the period.    Although there wasno significant change in our own regulations as they affect outwardinvestment during the period, less Stringent application of themmay have led to some upward movement.Direct investment (excluding oil)63.    The results of the Board of Trade Inquiry enable us to speak with more confidence about developments since 1958,    direct investment abroad increased rapidly - by over a quarter between1958 and 1960 and the latest estimates suggest that it may havebeen more.   Most of the increase was to the non-sterling countries,and that largely to North America.    Investment in the R.S.A.increased hardly at all;    and was mostly in the more industrialised countries, such as Australia and New Zealand.    In the same periodoverseas investment in the United Kingdom grew more rapidly -by about 70 per cent.    Almost all of this came from the non-sterling area, and most from the U.S.A.    About half the total in both directions was financed from re-invested profits.64.    In looking to the future we have assumed that there will beno sudden change in present trends, such as might result from ourjoining the Common Market.    Both inward and outward investment areexpected to continue to grow fairly rapidly, and the net balanceover the next few years may be little changed.Portfolio investment65.    Outward portfolio investment in the non-sterling area isprevented by Exchange Control and there was no significant outflow of capital on this account.    At the present time only a limited number of countries, e.g. Australia and New Zealand, have the creditstanding for effective access to the London Market.    The outgoingsfluctuate a great deal from year to year, and depend to aconsiderable extent on maturities of outstanding loans which haveto be refinanced.    In 1960 there appears to have been substantialUnited Kingdom disinvestment in South Africa and the Federation of rhodesia.    Investment in the United Kingdom by the R.S.A, has beenovershadowed by the use of the free markets of Hong Kong and Kuwaitto enable foreign holders of sterling to realise their investmentsin the United Kingdom;    this being treated in the balance ofpayments as disinvestment by the R.S.A. in the United Kingdom.There is normally only a small flow of portfolio investment from thenon-sterling area - on account of legacies, etc.    The larger inflowof 1960 appears to have been exceptional, and there is no reason to expect it to continue.
Oil Investment66.    Outward investment by the oil industry increased from about 80 million in 1952 to about  130 million in 1960.    Inward invest-ment rose from about  40 million to about  50 million in the same,period;    there was an abnormally high figure in 1958 because of theDutch share in the Royal Dutch-Shell public issue.    The normallevel of net outward investment by the oil industry is some 100 million.    Over the next few years little change is foreseenin the total level of outward investment, though there may be aswitch of expenditure from the non-sterling area to the R.S.A.No new major refinery projects are in prospect in the United kingdom for the period under review, and inward investment is expected to decline with the slowing down in the rate of expansion of theindustry here.    There may thus be some expansion of the net outwardflow of capital over the next few years.Total long-term capital67.    It is clear that on policies hitherto prevailing there.wouldbe an increase in net official lending over the next few years.Such evidence as there is points in the direction of a marked increasein net outward investment on private account, from the United Kingdomcompared to 1960,    But the evidence in this part of the field doesnot support any confident estimate.    In part we are projecting the continuation of a trend which has already begun, though obscuredby the exceptional conditions of 1960.    The net outflow last year was brought down by receipt of  24 million in compensation from egypt, by the abnormal inflow of portfolio investment from non-sterling countries and by a flight of capital from Africa.   when allowance is made for this and for the general upward curve ofprivate direct investment abroad and in the United Kingdom, weshould think that it would be unwise to count upon any relief tothe balance of payments over the next few years in the private sector of the account to offset the increase in the Governmentsector.    The probability is rather that the total net flow ofcapital abroad from the United Kingdom will increase.17
Part IV;    The trend of the balance of payments as a wholeSummary68. Table 14 below summarises the trends of the balance of payments as a whole sTable 14 - The balance of payments as a whole*Balance on;visible tradeinvisibles^current accountlong term capitalall identified itemsBalancing itemChange in externalmonetary position1952-54average-217+401+ 184-1754-94-12-2161958-60average-1244-124-214-214+ 1804- 346 millionChange(improvement4-93-277-184-39-2234-168-55* Including Defence Aid, which average  97 million in1952-54 and  1 million in 1958-60.** Secluding subscription of  232 million to the LLP.in 1959.4 Favourable        adverse 4-.69.     We have already aeait with the balances on visible trade,invisibles and long-term capita,! in Parts I to III.    In sum,there was an average annual surplus on all the identified items of  9 million in 1952-54 and an annual average deficit of 214 million in 1958-60, a worsening of  223 million.    (Defence aidis included in this table; without it the balance on identifieditems would have deteriorated by  127 million.)    To round off ouranalysis, we must comment briefly on the balancing item and thebalance of monetary movements.Balancing item70.    The change in the external monetary position reflects thebalance of all payments and receipts on current and capital account,identified and unidentified.    The current and capital accountsrecord those payments and receipts.across the exchanges which are known or can be estimated.   The balancing item required to reconcile the change in the external monetary position with the balance ofidentified transactions therefore measures the balance of receipts and payments which are not identified.71.    A positive balancing item (a net receipt) of about  100 million a year has been normal in recent years.    In 1960 it was abnormallylarge and amounted to  377 million, hence the high average figure of
- m 180 million in Table 14 for 1958-60.   We do not know the- nature ofthese unidentified receipts or why they were so large in 1960.But it seems probable that, while part of the inflow may have cometo stay, a considerable part may be, or may already have been,reversed this year.External monetary position72.    The external monetary position is the sum of the net changein our short term liabilities (mainly overseas sterling holdings)and liquid assets (mainly the reserves) on the external side.It measures the total outcome of the balance of payments.73.    This total outcome was favourable in 1952-54 and adverse in1958-60;    in the first period our net external short termliabilities went down by an average of  21 million a year;    inthe second period they went up by an average of  34 million ayear.    It will be appreciated, however, from the preceding paragraphs that the adverse change in the external monetary position in 1958-60 would have been much greater but for the hugeunidentified receipts of 1960.   As already indicated, receipts of this kind on such a scale cannot be taken as likely to continue.Future trend74.    In stating our views about the broad outlook over the nextfew years we should like to make it clear that there will inevitably be fluctuations in the balance of payments from time totime in the future as in the past.    The assessment we are hereconcerned with relates to the future trend, from which the actualoutcome of the balance of payments may deviate widely from year to year.75.    Our views may be summarised in the following way.    The rateof net long-term capital investment abroad, including bothG-overnment lending and private investment, is already about 200 million a year, and it may be more in a few years time.Ret invisible earnings are likely to be negligible.    Thus, even after allowing for a normal credit balancing item of substantialsize, a very large annual surplus on visible trade would berequired to finance our capital commitments.    There has been a surplus of exports over imports in only one post-war year.This was 1958, when the surplus was some  60 million, andconditions were unusually propitious.    In other words, we aresaying that a major turn round in the course of our foreign tradeis required.    But our examination of the prospects for the visiblebalance does not suggest that there is any likelihood whatever ofsuch a change coming about of its own accord.    Indeed the probability is rather that the visible account will continue in deficit.    A vast improvement in the balance of visible trade istherefore needed compared with the trend rate of 1958-60.   A still greater improvement is needed from the present rate of deficit onvisible trade;    the magnitude involved is discussed in Part VIIbelow.76.    Quite apart, therefore, from the needs of the immediate situation, our finding is that there is a fundamental trend ofimbalance in our external account.    This cannot continue for long.Either positive action can be taken to arrest and reverse the trend,or else the account will be brought into balance by enforced, andprobably progressive, depreciation of the currency.77. So much for the trend over the next few years. We turn now tothe recent past and the immediate prospect.
Part Vi    The balance of payments in 1960-62196078.    After a series of years in which the balance of paymentsfluctuated but was cumulatively in balance, a serious deteriorationset in during 1959 and has continued since.    In 1960 exportsindeed rose by  200 million but imports rose by  500 million.   Netinvisible earnings fell again and made almost no contribution tooffsetting the deficit on visible trade.    The balance on identifiedcurrent account was unfavourable&apos;by nearly  350 million and with anet unfavourable balance on long-term capital account of 200 million there was a deficit of  545 million on identifiedcurrent and long-term capital account.    The external monetary position deteriorated by only  168 million, as we had netunidentified receipts of  377 million.79.    It was these large unidentified receipts and the movement intosterling by the non-sterling countries to the extent of over 450 million (excluding the Pord funds) that masked the seriousness of our position last year, and enabled us to increase the reservesby  177 million in spite of repayment of  127 million to the I.M.P,Thus, although the reserves rose, short-term liabilities rose muchmore and the vulnerability of sterling was seriously increased.Pirst half 196180.    In the first quarter of 1961 exports continued at about thesame level but imports fell, and the identified deficit on current account was reduced to an annual rate of about  200 million.    Thenet flow of long-term capital was inward by about  20 million, butonly because of the investment by Pord&apos;s of some  130 million.With the pressure on sterling during March following the revaluation of the Deutschemark and the Guilder there was a sharpreversal of the flow of short-term funds in 1960.    The high levelof unidentified receipts we normally have in the first quarter ofthe year was considerably reduced.    The monetary position was favourable by about  30 million, but, if the Pord transaction isabstracted from this result it is seen that there would have beena much larger deterioration in the monetary position than in thepreceding quarters.Since the first quarter there may have been some slightimprovement in the underlying position, but a heavy outflow of short term funds continued.    Despite further assistance from othercentral banks, our reserves fell steeply, bringing the loss in thefirst half of the year to  164 million.    On 30th June, 1961, the reserves stood at  990 million.1961-6281.    The Committee on Balance of Payments Prospects has justcompleted a forecast of the balance of payments over the twelvemonths to the end of June, 1962.    The more important conclusionsemerging from this forecast on the identifiable items ares(a)    The balance of payments is at present getting somerelief from a lower rate of stock-building but, withexpansion in the domestic economy, imports will startrising again fairly soon.
(b) Chiefly as a result of conditions in our importantR.S.A. markets exports will probably fall during themiddle two quarters of this year, but they should thereafter be on a rising trend.(c) Throughout the period a deficit on visible trade running at an annual rate of some  150 million is expected.(d) Net invisible income from abroad has shrunk to a negligible level, and no early prospect is seen of any significant improvement in this sector of the balanceof payments.(e) On long-term capital account a net outflow of some 300 million must be expected over the coming twelvemonths.82.    The Committee could not predict any figure for the balancingitem, but for the sake of taking their analysis further theyassumed that the balancing item over the coming twelve months wouldbe of normal size, i.e., no net unidentified receipt (or payment)in the second half of 1961 and an unidentified receipt of  100 million in the first half of 1962.    This assumption is not intended toindicate what is likely to happen in practice, to which we returnat paragraph 86 below.83.    The Committee further envisaged, as a result of their study of the outlook for the balance of payments of the R.S.A., thatthe sterling holdings of the R.S.A. may fall by as much as 110 million in the second half of 1961 and perhaps a further 15 million in the first half of 1962.84.    The result of their analysis are summed up in the followingtable.Table 15j    Outcome of halanco of payments in 1961-62  millionSecond half First half YearTgcT             T^bT 196T^o&quot;2Identified deficit on current and long term capital accounts                           265                 170 435Less normal unidentifiedcredits (balancing item) - 100 100Implied total deterioration in external monetary position &quot; 265 70 335of which;Improvement in monetary position vis a vis R.S.A.(R.S.A. sterling holdingsfall) &quot; &quot; 110- 15 125Deterioration in monetary position vis a vis non-sterling countries 375 o5 h-c.-.,
^^85.    In short, the United Kingdom is expected to have a deficit onidentified current and long-term capital account and onunidentified items (at the normal level assumed) amounting to 335 million in 1961-62, which would he financed by a totaldeterioration in our monetary position of corresponding amount.Since our short-term liabilities to the R.S.A. are expected to fallby  125 million as a consequence of the deficit foreseen in theirbalance of payments, it follows that our monetary position vis a vis the non-sterling countries would deteriorate by 460 million.    Under the conditions envisaged it is hardlyconceivable that any of this deterioration should take the formof an increase in net short-term liabilities to the non-sterling countries.    If our net short-term liabilities to them do not rise,our short term assets - the reserves -   must therefore fall to thefull extent of the expected deterioration of  460 million vis a vis the non-sterling countries over the twelve months from now.    this study was not carried beyond mid-1962, but thereafter we must expect the normal seasonal deterioration in the second half of nextyear.86.    On the basis of the forecast, which of course assumes that no action to redress the situation has been taken, these figuresrepresent the minimum drawing on the reserves, of which  375 million would fall in the second half of this year.    If sentiment aboutsterling does not improve and, a fortiori, if there were a further deterioration in confidence, there could be, and almost certainlywould be, an immense additional strain on the reserves as a resultof an outflow of funds in one form or another.    The potentialmagnitude is not quantifiable.    Very large unidentifiable flowsare possible, e.g. in the form of leads and lags in the settlementof commercial transactions.    Some indication of the scope of theidentifiable element, that is, the conversion of sterling holdingsinto other currencies by non-residents, is given by the fact thatat the end of May last the private sterling holdings of non-sterling countries stood about  400 million higher than they didafter the crisis of confidence in 1957.87.    To meet the total drain we had reserves of  990 million atthe end of June.    Our quota in the I.M.F. is roughly  700 million,(in principle, the upper limit to a drawing is 125 per cent of quota,but for us to reckon on the last 25 per cent tranche would not berealistic.)   A considerable part of these second line reserves isalready mortgaged, however, since the central banks which haveassisted us under the Basle agreement would probably expectrepayment of most of our short-term debt to them as soon as we madea drawing on the I.M.F.87,   We therefore reach the conclusion that unless very early and very drastic action is taken to redress the balance of payments andrestore confidence in sterling our reserves could be effectivelyexhausted over the next six months.    If, on the other hand, a programme of measures is announced quickly which is manifestlyadequate to remedy our balance of payments on an enduring basiswithin a reasonable period, then confidence in sterling could returnand our reserve loss this year could be limited to the 375 million, less any economies achieved this year and any returnflow of short-term capital to this country.    Given such arestoration of confidence we should have more time to put mattersright.    Even so, the time at our disposal is still very short inwhich to eliminate the substantial deficit in our external accounts.We can buy time by drawing on the I.M.F. but if we do we shall need to develop a surplus in our accounts with which to repay the drawingin the required time of 3 to 5 years.
Part VI;    DiagnosisThe development of the balance of payments as. a whole88.    The balance of payments is determined by the totality ofeconomic conditions within a country compared with those in the restof the world.     The task of diagnosing the reasons for a state ofimbalance is therefore far from easy.     But we feel that the evidence we have accumulated justifies a broad diagnosis, in which we have considerable confidence, of the difficulties which have beset our external position,89.    We start from the point that the balance of -payments over thelast few years has been in deficit.      Exports of goods, invisibleincome and capital receipts have not matched imports of goods,invisible expenditure and capital payments.     Thus we have had to borrow heavily at short term to cover our deficit.90.    Our imports of goods have been rising, both absolutely and inrelation to our national income.     This has been the commonexperience of our neighbours in Europe whose economies have grownmost rapidly.     Our economy is not peculiar in this respect;    indeed in Germany, Prance, Italy and Sweden over the last seven yearsimports have grown more quickly in relation to national income thanin the United Kingdom.      Our exports of goods have also risen,  butnot so fast as our imports and less quickly in relation to national income than in the European countries mentioned.      Here our perform-ance has been very different, and closer to that of the UnitedStates of America.91.&apos;  Our income on invisible account has also risen but not soquickly as expenditure.     Here the development of the Governmentsector predominates.      The net expenditure^ of the Government over-seas has more, than doubled in ten years.      Payments on privateaccount (excluding interest on sterling holdings - classified in theprivate sector in the balance of payments) increased by about halfbetween 1952/54 and 1958/60 but receipts increased by only about a third.      In 1960 the private sector was in surplus by just over 300 million whereas the Government sector was in deficit by nearly 290 million.      If interest on sterling holdings were treated as government expenditure, the private surplus would become nearly 450 million and the Government deficit nearly  430 million.      the rising trend of invisible payments, is not out of line with experience in other industrialised countries;    our debits have grown much lessquickly than those of Germany and Italy,  for instance, and littlefaster than those of United States of America, Prance and Sweden.Once again it is the slower growth on the credit side thatdistinguishes our experience from that of the comparable Europeaneconomies.      The credits of all the countries just mentioned have grown faster than ours, and some much faster.      And,  of course, theburden of Government spending overseas is without parallel outsidethe United States of America and perhaps Prance.92.    On long-term capital account there is again a distinction to bedrawn between the Government and the private sector.      Over theperiod of our examination - 1952/54 to 1958/60 - annual net lendingby the Government has gone up by over  50 million.     In the private sector investment abroad by the United Kingdom and investment in theUnited Kingdom from abroad have approximately kept pace and the netoutward flow has changed very little.      The growth of private investment by and in the United Kingdom has taken place alongside^Excluding Defence Aid.
the growth of international investment generally, and is to be seenagainst the background of the rapidly expanding wealth of theindustrial countries and the gradual removal of barriers to the freeflow of capital.93.    These in simple outline are the main features of the develop-ment of our balance of payments over the last ten years.(a) Net overseas Government expenditure, capital and current,rose substantially.(b) There was a large fall in net receipts on privateinvisible account, most of it in the last three years.(c) Although the improvement in our terms of trade led to areduction in the deficit on visible trade, this wasnowhere near sufficient to cover what we lost on government and invisible account.9k.    No further explanation of the rise in Government overseas expenditure is necessary;    in any event, the whole field of such expenditure is being reviewed elsewhere to see if savings can bemade.      We have given a full explanation of the proximate causes ofthe worsening on private invisible account in Part II;    the declinein United Kingdom shipping;    the world surplus of oil;    the rise inthe interest bill on the sterling holdings;    and the faster growth of income paid on foreign investment in the United Kingdom than of income received from United Kingdom investment in overseas countries.The main need is therefore to diagnose the reasons for our inadequateperformance on visible trade.      This is all the more important sincevisible trade is the largest sector of the balance of payments,accounting for some two-thirds of all our overseas transactions on current and long-term capital account, and must make the maincontribution to correcting our balance of payments.    Our &quot;preliminary discussion of specific remedies leads us to believe that &apos;there is little scope for direct action in the private sector of theinvisible and long term capital accounts, although some purelyemergency steps in this field may be necessary as part of animmediate programme of remedial action.Diagnosis of visible trade experience95.    Any just assessment of the trend of our visible balance must take account of the difficulties we have faced.     Much of the declinein our share of world exports of manufactured goods is but areflection of the very great expansion of Japanese and German exports from their low post-war level.     The expansion of our own exporttrade has been affected by the changing nature of export demand, bythe declining competitiveness of some of our traditional exportingindustries and by the differing rates of expanding demand for imports in the different world markets.     Our traditional major markets inthe sterling Commonwealth have been expanding less rapidly than themore industrialised countries, which have hitherto been less important in our trading pattern.     Much of our favoured position in theseCommonwealth markets has disappeared with shrinking tariff preferences, the removal of import restrictions on the goods of our competitors and the falling away of commercial connections asindependence was gained.     We cannot do much to alter the externalconditions affecting our sales abroad.     We must, therefore, adjustour own economy to them, in order to establish a viable balance oftrade and of payments.2k
6.    There are three possible explanations of our failure to do this;(i)   We have not succeeded in producing enough of the sorts ofgood most in demand, both at home and abroad.(ii)   Our cost of production for the goods for which we compete with foreign producers for customers, both abroad and athome, are too high.(iii)    Our producers do net strive sufficiently energetically towin business in competition with such foreign producers.97.    We think that in practice each of these factors has played its part;    insufficient expansion of production in lines where demand hasbeen most buoyant, reflecting insufficient investment in the rightplaces;    the failure of our traditional system of wage negotiationto meet the needs of the new situation created by full employment,leading to an almost continuous rise in costs of production;    andthe maintenance of too high a level of domestic demand in relationto our productive capacity, which has resulted in there being too little incentive to compete with foreign producers and a general economic climate conducive to excessive wage settlements and rising costs.Investment and capacity.98.    Over and above the general problems arising from the excessivepressure of home demand, which we discuss below, there is evidence in the 1950&apos;s of exports lost and imports encouraged by particularlyacute shortages of productive capacity in particular industries,some of which have been persistent or recurrent.     Sectors of the machine tool industry and the steel industry provide well-knowninstances.     A higher level of investment in these industries wouldhave been necessa,ry to prevent these bottlenecks occurring and,failing reductions elsewhere, this could not have been accommodatedwithout a higher level of saving to finance it.     We believe thatstimulation of greater willingness to expand production in suchcases and the ordering of our domestic financial affairs in such away that a higher level of investment can be accommodated arenecessary parts of a longer term programme for improving our visiblebalance.Competitivenessi99.    Competitiveness is not a simple or measurable quality.      It isan amalgam of many things;    price, performance,  quality, durability,design, credit terms, salesmanship and delivery dates.     Some ofthese characteristics cannot be measured and compared internationallyon others objective evidence over the vast range of our production is impossible to come by.     There are defects in and complaintsabo^^t this or that aspect of our production and selling, but broadlywe know that our economy can and does produce on a considerable scale a wide range of goods our overseas customers want.     We alsoknow that our exporters can now give credit terms as good as their main competitors.     On delivery dates  no-&apos; adequate statistics areavailable for international comparison.100. The most general and accepted measure of competitiveness isprice.     Here again reliable and comprehensive evidence is hard tocome by,     The mere fact that we export about  3,500 million worth of goods every year indicates that we are competitive over a wide25
range;    and this conclusion is reinforced by our success in one ofthe most difficult markets,  the United States of America and by therecent rapid expansion of our exports to Germany.      But, on the otherhand, there may also be a wide range of goods whore we have failedto get business because we were not competitive.     We cannot know how much more we might have been able to export if our prices had beenlower.      The fact that the Continental countries have increased their exports much more rapidly than we have done suggests thatworld demand was adequate if we had been able to match the perform-ance of our competitors.101. The trend of material costs in the engineering and vehicleindustries of the United Kingdom and continental European countries has on average been much the same during the 1950s, and in 1959there was no evidence that these costs were higher in theUnited Kingdom than in Germany or the United States of America.Currently the total labour costs per unit of output in manufacturing industry are probably little different in the United Kingdom andother principal European countries, while in the United States theymay be marginally higher, but this is by no means certain.     Allthese comparisons are attended with some uncertainty, however, andthe fact that almost half the firms supplying the information tothe F.B.I. recently (the Export Supplement to the F.B.I. IndustrialTrends Enquiry published in June,  1961) expected prices to make it more difficult to secure orders in the immediate &quot;future suggeststhat our prices may be becoming less competitive.102. In view of the opinions expressed by many firms replying tothe F.B.I. and of the apparent renewal of the upward trend of prices and costs at home, we think that it will be necessary to restrainany further upward movement of domestic costs and prices if thepresent parity of sterling is to be maintained.      To get back intobalance we have not merely to hold our own, but probably to increase our share of world exports, which has fallen so markedly in recentyears.      A price advantage would be of great help in achieving this aim, but to get that we shall have to keep the rise in wages more closely in line with the increase in productivity than we havemanaged to do in the past.      Fortunately, the inflationary tendenciesin the economies of some of our main competitors and the upwardsurge of world trade we expect towards the end of this year presentus v/ith an excellent opportunity to recover part of our lost shareif we can hold our own costs and prices down.103. Our opinion that rising prices constitute a serious danger toour balance of payments is supported by the recent O.E.E.C. Reporton Rising Prices.      This report finds that during the period1953-1960 among the developed countries of Europe and North America(apart from Prance, which was obliged to devalue her currency duringthe period) the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and the scandinavian countries experienced a greater than average increase in prices.The United Kingdom is also identified, together with the UnitedStates of America and Denmark, as one of the group of countries inwhich excessive wage increases constituted an important and independent inflationary force.Pressure of demand and wages104. We agree with this.      In our view the lack of a more positivepolicy to ensure that wage increases were not higher in relation tothe increase in productivity than in competing countries was a fact which contributed appreciably to the worsening of our balance oftrade.26
^35. Excess demand reinforces the basic tendency to cost inflation.When there is excess demand for labour the pace of wage increasestends to be set by firms who need more labour and are willing to pay more to get it.      Other firms are obliged to accede to demands for higher wages in order to keep their labour, and concerns not directlythreatened with a shortage of labour will nevertheless be under strong pressure to concede wage increases in line with the general pattern of advance.      And when prices rise, as they must if money wages risefaster than productivity, the increased cost of living providesgrounds for further demands for higher wages and salaries.      Lastlythe rise in profits and dividends, which normally goes with rising prices and excess demand, is a factor which tends to inflate wagedemands.106. This analysis is supported by the recent behaviour of thehourly wage rate index, which rose by less than 6 per cent.duringthe two years of relatively slack demand between the first auarterof 1958 and the first quarter of 1960, after rising by 12i per centin the preceding two years when pressure of demand was higher.     Withthe very low unemployment of the&quot;last year, a more rapid rate of advance has been resumed.Pressure of demand and resources.107. Quite apart from the relative movement of prices home demandhas, in our view, been too great.      (By home demand we mean the totalexpenditure of the private and public sectors on consumption and investment, including imports.)      In simple terms, too large a shareof our resources has been devoted to satisfying demand within theUnited Kingdom, and too small a share to satisfying demand fromabroad.      Total demand from the home and the external market hasbeen too large in relation to our productive resources,  so drawingin too great a volume of imports.     In tho years when pressure ofhome demand has been strongest -- for example,  in 1955 and 1960-61 -the deficit on visible trade which is a normal feature of our balanceof payments has been,Increased.    Though there have been, years in whichtotal demand has not been excessive in relation to our resources, weare of the opinion that the average pressure of home demand over theperiod has been too high to allow us to develop and maintain avisible trade surplus of the size needed.108. The connection between home demand and the balance of payments is as follows.      If demand increases faster than productive capacity,additional imports will be attracted in a proportion greater thanthe ratio by which demand has increased.     At the same time the factthat domestic industry cannot meet all the demands made on it by thehome market will make it more difficult to expand exports.      Shortageof labour and other resources will limit the overall capacity toproduce more, and the boom in the home market, on which most firmsdepend for the bulk of their orders, will reduce the incentive to seek fresh outlets in the more competitive overseas markets.     the will to compete with foreign producers is undermined.     In an extreme case exports may actually fall, particularly if the strength of domestic demand is not matched by similar increases of demand in overseas markets, but it is more reasonable to suppose that theeffect of excess home demand v/ill be to restrict the rate at whichexports increase, while accelerating the growth of imports.     Thuswe would expect that an excessive pressure of home demand would cause imports to increase faster than exports, and this is precisely what has happened, spasmodically over the last decade andcontinuously over the last two years.
109. It has been found that over the decade since 1950 there has beena close correlation between the movement of the visible trade balanceat current prices on the one hand and the ratio of home demand to domestic productive capacity on the other.     This is illustrated inthe graph attached.110. Variations in home demand have primarily affected imports.There does not appear to be any clear correlation between the pressure of home demand and the growth of exports during the periodwe have considered.      There are several reasons for this lack ofcorrelation during the period under review;(i)    The brief periods of low domestic pressure of demand in1952-53 and 1958-59 were periods in which export demand was weak owing to world trading conditions.      At no timein the last ten years has the pressure of domestic demandbeen low when world trade was expanding strongly.(ii)    Excess capacity has never persisted for long, and domestic producers have been justified in assuming that recessionswould be shallow and short-lived.     Expectations of anearly recovery of domestic demand have reduced incentives to look for new markets abroad, and led to some hoardingof labour.The pressure of demand in relation to capacity is not,  of course,uniform over all parts of industry at any one time.     When the pattern of demand does not match the pattern of supply there is bound to beslack here and there;    and la,bour does not move quickly in response,to local variations in demand for it.111. The fact that fluctuations in the balance of visible trade canbe correlated with fluctuations in the pressure of home demand doesnot of itself establish the proposition that if the pressure of home demand had been continuously lower the balance of trade would havebeen continuously better.      But it strengthens the presumption infavour of this conclusion.28
PART VII?    REMEDIES112.    In this part of our report we put forward as principalremedies disinflation and control over costs.    We go on to considerthe effects of disinflation on economic growth and employment.    we also suggest an intensified export drive.    We then give our reasons for rejecting devaluation and import restrictions andconclude with a discussion of various direct measures to relieve the balance of payments.Disinflation113.    The most recent report of the National Income ForecastsV/orking Party foresees that in the year to mid-1962 totaldomestic demand at I960 prices will he almost  1,000 million higher than in the past.year.    The forecasts of the Committeeon Balance of Payments Prospects indicate a deficit in the overall&quot;balance of payments in the year to mid-1962 of some  330 million.This is the measure of the improvement in the balance of payments which is urgently needed simply to restore balance.    We shalleventually have to aim at securing an overall surplus to pay offthe debt, much of it short-term, which has been incurred and will go on being incurred while the deficit persists.114.    It will not suffice to reduce home demand by an amount equalto that by which we mean to improve the balance of payments since there will not be a one-for-one correspondence between changesin home demand and movements in the current balance of payments.It is difficult to estimate precisely how much reduction in home demand will be needed to effect the necessary improvement in our balance of payments, but we think that a reduction of at leasttwice as much is called for in the coming year - that is, areduction of  too- 700 million in home demand below the forecastrate.    This would still leave home demand rising.Control of Costs115.    It is also urgently necessary to halt the rise in theUnited Kingdom money costs of production in order to make our economy
I fully competitive.    This will not result simply from measures ofdisinflation;    it requires a definite Government initiative inthe field of wage settlement.    It is necessary to work out asounder longer-term policy covering both incomes and industrial efficiency.    Meantime we are facing an emergency which justifiesa call for a pause in wage increases.Economic Growth116.    We wish to make it clear that we are not recommending a return to what have been termed &quot;Stop-Go&quot; policies.    It is ourview that, if the necessary surplus on visible trading account isto be achieved and maintained, the economy will have to be runin future at a somewhat lower and steadier pressure of domestic demand than in the years since the war.    It would have to be made clear that this was a permanent policy.    This would be important for the confidence of other countries in sterling and to ensurethat our industrialists made their plans on the basis of a continuing lower level of home demand in relation to capacity andnot in the expectation that the pressure of home demand would beallowed to rise as soon as our balance of payments showed some improvement.117.    It is often said that the way to solve our balance ofpayments problem is to expand our way out of it;    the best way to export more Is to produce more;    and that therefore we should aim at a higher rate of growth of output and avoid measurescalculated to depress home demand.118.    In considering the relation between economic growth andthe balance of payments it is essential to distinguish betweenthe long-term rate of growth and fluctuations in demand.    Thisis a distinction between the growth of capacity to produce andthe degree of utilisation of that capacity.    The rate of growth of output cannot be increased for very long simply by raising the degree of utilisation of resources.    It will be clear from what has already been said in this Report that short-term increases30
in output which result from an increase of the pressure of home demand on capacity will affect the balance of paymentsunfavourably.     The sharp changes of policy needed to correctrecurrent balance of payments deficits are themselves likely tohave detrimental effects on the growth of output, and may reducethe long-term rate of growth if fluctuations impair the confidence of business men and make them less willing to invest and planahead.119.    In our view there is no necessary incompatibility betweenachieving a satisfactory long-term rate of growth and maintaining a rather bigger margin between home demand and our capacity toproduce.    What ultimately matters for growth and investment isthat manufacturers should have confidence in their ability to sellincreased output for an adequate return.    In our circumstances as a trading nation this means that they must be confident oftheir ability to meet the competition of foreign producers.    Ifthey have this confidence this should provide a sufficientincentive to make the investments which are important for growth.Hence, the cruciax role of adequate action on wages to createconfidence in our ability to compete abroad.120.    Moreover, there are many ways in which investment could be directly encouraged if necessary, once we have a margin of capacity which would make it safe to do this.    Some basicindustrial investment is in the public sector, and thereforeresponsive to Government action.    The incentive to invest can also be influenced by other means, e.g. through alteration oftaxation arrangements.121.    Finally we would emphasise that growth is not simply amatter of increasing investment.    There are several ways in whichthe efficiency with which resources are used could be improvedwithout incurring additional capital expenditure on a large scale.Changes could be made in the distribution of investment that31
would increase the effectiveness of a given total in improvingour ability to produce exportable goods at competitive prices.The training of labour could be improved, and certain restrictive practices of labour, manufacturers, and traders could be modifiedor abolished with beneficial effects.    The acceleration of growth in this way by the more efficient use of resources is likely to generate forces which are in themselves favourable to the balanceof payments.122.    These and other related matters are dealt with more fully in the July Report by officials on Economic Growth and NationalEfficiency which has now been circulated to Ministers.Effects of working below capacity123.   Manufacturers sometimes complain that restrictive measuresactually increase their costs by forcing them to work plantbelow the capacity for which it was designed.    It is undeniablethat curtailment of demand causes difficulties to producers who cannot readily adapt themselves to a changing pattern of demand.For those who produce a product that can be sold abroad the simple answer is that they should export more.    Other firmswould have to release resources to firms that were able to sellabroad.    The example of Switzerland and Holland shows that exportsuccess is possible without the support of a large home market.Undoubtedly there would be many hard cases, but there is aparamoufflrifc necessity to reduce the proportion of resources usedto meet home demand, and this cannot be done painlessly.Employment122+.    The disinflationary policy v^e advocate has clear implications for employment.    It has been a consequence of running the economyvery close to capacity almost throughout the post-war period thatour overall rate of unemployment has been very low - for much ofthe time 1-g- per cent, or less.    This should not be regarded as theamount of reserve manpower available.   Many of the small numbers of
unemployed are unemployable5  and some people are bound tobebetweenjobs at any given time when a count is taken.    The figures ofunfilled vacancies show that we have normally suffered from ashortage of labour, that is from overfull employment.125.    Hence an increase above the present low figure of unemploy-ment, resulting inevitably from measures to relieve the overloadon the economy, should not be regarded as disquieting.    It is vital that when success in reducing the pressure on resources and on the labour market is achieved the position then reachedshould be maintained.    We must not throw away again by prematureand excessive reflation an opportunity such as we had in 1958,of keeping the balance of payments on a sound footing.    At thesame time the needs of these outlying areas where unemploymenttends to be two or three times the national average could not be ignored.    But these local problems should be dealt with by measures of the type covered by the Local Employment Act and not by general reflationary steps.
Export Drive and Consultation with Industry126.     There is a widespread impression among informed observersthat the weakness in our export performance is not due only toexcessive pressure of home demand and excessive costs.    there seems to he an inadequate will to compete and inadequate invest-ment planning for export markets.    This is a trouble which itis difficult to remedy solely by use of the normal instruments of G-overnment policy.    Cuts in tariffs would be beneficial byassimilating conditions on the home markets to conditions in world markets5    this is particularly true of reciprocated tariff reductions such as would follow entry into the Common Market.But in the short run, a lowering of trade barriers between ourselves and our strongest competitors would affect our balance of trade adversely to the extent that we were not fully competitive.-127.    In a number of quarters it has been suggested that achange of attitude towards exports might be promoted by asystem of export incentives.    These possibilities have beenexhaustively examined by the Board of Trade in the recent past and have been rejected by Ministers, partly on account of lackof conviction about their effectiveness, partly because of theadministrative problems to which they would give rise and partly by reason of our international obligations as regards export subsidies.   We have not thought it necessary to go over this ground again and we accept the conclusion that export incentiveswould not provide an effective means of stimulating increasedexport activity.    This is not to say that the work of improving the export promotion facilities which the Government provides,including export credit insurance should not continue to be pressed forward.
127(a)    Disinflation and control of costs should help a greatdeal to improve export performance.    But to mitigate the dangerof a negative response by parts of British industry we thinkthereis a case for developing further the existing arrangementsfor consultation with individual major industries with theobject of discussing problems of capacity and urging the needfor an increased allocation of resources to the export trade.One possibility which deserves further consideration is a development of the kind of joint studies that have already beenmade of the future of the steel, aircraft, chemicals and ship-building industries.   Many of the other recommendations in theReport on Growth and Efficiency have a bearing on this questionof industry&apos;s ability and readiness to compete.35
Devaluation128.    Devaluation is sometimes thought to offer an easy wayout of our balance of payments troubles.   We reject devaluationfor the following reasons(a) Devaluation is not an alternative to disinflation.To improve the balance of payments at present terms oftrade means withdrawing a large quantity of resources from use at home.   Devaluation by worsening the termsof trade would add substantially to the sacrificeneeded.(b) Devaluation would raise prices and exacerbate the wage-price spiral.    If it occurred when the economy wasoverloaded and wages and prices already moving up itmight lead to a progressive depreciation of the valueof the pound at home and abroad.(c) It would disturb the whole structure of exchange rates,perhaps imperil the position of the dollar and lead toa period of confusion in world trade and payments,(d) It would do grave damage to the overseas holders of sterling.    Devaluation would be akin to bankruptcy.Our creditors, mostly Governments of much poorer coun-tries than ours, would be shocked and resentful and manywould seek to transfer their money into gold or other currencies.   We have not sufficient reserves to convertthe overseas holdings at anything like the present rateof exchange.   Hence either the holdings would have tobe blocked or a very substantial depreciation might be forced on us.129.    This is not to deny that if we fail to check the costinflation soon circumstances might virtually force devaluationupon us.    But it would not provide a lasting solution.    It would36
only give us a fresh start in highly unfavourable circumstances.Hence all efforts now should be concentrated on restoring our competitive power at the present exchange rate.Direct Measures130.    It should be possible eventually to get the balance ofpayments on a sound footing and keep it so by action on thelevel of demand and on costs.    But the deficit has grown so large and continued so long that additional measures of anemergency character have to be considered.    We have consideredthe foilowings-(a) Import restrictions.(b) Restrictions on travel.(c) Restrictions on overseas investment.(d) Reduct ion of aid programme.(e) Reduction of military expenditure overseas.Import Restrictions131.    Import restrictions are advocated in some quarters as a means of improving the balance of payments with the least possible reduction of home demand.    It is claimed that thispolicy was adopted; with success in 1951 and should be appliedto our problem in 1961.     In fact the improvement in the balanceof payments in 1952 is attributable more to a sharp fall in investment in stocks and declining import prices than to theoperation of the import restrictions.    It is worth recallingthat these 1951 measures were adopted by the Government on firstcoming into office as a crisis measure to deal with a situationinherited from its predecessors.     At that time the Governmenthad at its command the full apparatus of control, includingrationing and price control.    It was still the sole importer of
na wide range of foodstuffs and industrial raw materials, and state trading and Government control over distribution of stocks and prices were major factors in enabling cuts to be made withthe minimum dislocation.   Moreover, as far as private imports were concerned, the whole apparatus of import control wasfunctioning because at that time we had only liberalised importsfrom the sterling area and to a considerable extent from O.E.E.Ccountries.    The situation is now entirely different in that weare running a free economy with freedom of imports of almost all goods from all sources other than the Sino-Soviet Bloc and Japan.The apparatus of control has withered away.132.    In considering restrictions it is necessary to distinguish between a limited scheme applying only to less essential goods and a comprehensive scheme involving cuts right across theboard.    The first would require some 8 months to become fully effective because the administrative machinery would take somemonths to reconstruct.    The second would require a much moreelaborate machine to cope also with problems of allocation.    Alimited scheme could not produce large savings because expendi-ture would turn from controHediD uncontrolled imports.    a comprehensive scheme would involve a return to a controlledeconomy as a long-term policy.    It could not be applied quickly and quickly dismantled.133.   A system of continuing import restriction would rundirectly counter to the need to make the economy more competi-tive with foreign production.    It would shelter our manufacturers and tend to raise costs.    It would divert effort from exports to meeting home requirements previously met by imports.    It wouldnot obviate the need to reduce the level of demand.
134.    The international repercussions would be very serious.It would be extremely difficult to decide whether to exempt the sterling area or the Commonwealth or SFTA from the restrictions.It would make an impossible basis on which to seek to negotiate with the Six.    It would, of course, make nonsense of the policyof reducing tariff barriers in the G.A.T.T,     If we, as a majortrading power, sought to deal with our balance of payments difficulties by the reimposition of import restrictions it can-not be ruled out that other countries would be encouraged tofollow a similar policy to the detriment of our export earnings.It would create the worst possible impression on world opinion-if, among the very first measures taken to deal with the balanceof payments deficit that has been allowed to persist for twoyears, we resorted to import restrictions. Such a policy wouldhandicap us in seeking financial support from the international monetary Fund.135.    To sum up, we do not think import restrictions could makeany useful contribution in the present crisis because theywould take so long to come into force and would have suchdamaging effects on foreign opinion.    The case for imposing them should be reconsidered later if it became apparent that moderatemeasures of disinflation were failing to restore the balance of payment s.
Restriction on Travel136.    The case for reimposing a limit on tourist expenditureabroad rests rather on the psychological effect than on the monetary savings.    Foreign travel is widely regarded as luxuryexpenditure which it would be inappropriate to leave untouchedif unpopular measures had to be taken to restrain home demand and. if we were making a case to N.A.T.O. to obtain relief fromthe full cost of our military commitments.   While some of the criticisms set out above in regard to import restrictions applyhere as well, it would probably be possible to restrict travelexpenditure without leading to a progressive breakdown of theinternational rules designed to free trade and payments; althoughit must be recognized that many countries in Western europe would regard a cut in our tourist expenditure as a severe blow to one of their major export industries.137&apos;    There are strong arguments against taking this step.The saving would be small - perhaps about  20 million with a limit of  50 and virtually nothing with a limit of  100 whichwould be less unacceptable to the U.S.A,    Secondly, thisretreat from our normal obligations under international agree-ments would have to be justified in both the international monetary Fund and the 0.E.E.C,(there is also a particularUNISCAN difficulty).    There might be difficulty in getting theFund&apos;s approval for the discrimination in favour of the sterling area which we should have to apply since there is no exchange control between the U.K. and the rest of the sterling area.Thirdly, restriction on tourist expenditure would have to bebuttressed by controls over other types of personal paymentssuch as cash gifts and business travel.    Even so,  evasion onkO
a considerable scale would be likely. In this and other waysthe standing of the pound abroad would be damaged.138.   We conclude that this matter should be reviewedbetween now and October in the light of the effect of themeasures which are shortly to be announced.   Meanwhile weshould warn the I.M.P. of this possibility when we approach the Fund for credit.Restrictions on overseas investment139.    We have considered whether further restrictions shouldbe placed on the export of capital by private persons andfirms.    The present position is that private investment inthe R.S.A. is unrestricted, but investment in non-sterling countries is subject to exchange control, and portfolio investment outside the sterling area is virtually prohibitedDirect investment in non-sterling countries has been risingrecently, particularly in Western Europe, and this trend isexpected to continue.    Most of this investment can beexpected to be profitable, and in the long run there is little doubt that it will strengthen our balance of pay-ments.    But in the short run it represents an additional burden on our resources, and our present position is so serious that we consider that,it would be desirable to restrictprivate direct investment in non-sterling countries by a severe tightening of exchange control while the balance ofpayments difficulty persists.140,   Much overseas investment takes place through thereinvestment of profits earned by British owned firmsoperating outside the United Kingdom.     We consider that,41
if new direct investment is to be controlled, it would belogical to make use also of the Exchange Control powers whichwe have to require firms to bring back to the U.K. the largestproportion of their profits earned overseas that is practicable.11+1.    Investment by U.K. residents in the sterling area has never been subject to control, and to bring it under controlnow&apos; would mean subjecting all transactions with the area to exchange Control, so disrupting the whole sterling area system.We advise against this course.li+2.   We will report later on the manner in which taxation andparticularly the legislation on Overseas Trading Corporationsaffects overseas investment.Reduction in overseas aid143*   The ceiling of the overseas aid programme was recentlysettled by Ministers at  190 million -  200 million a year and commitments have been entered into which nearly exhaust this allowance.     Any reduction   below this level is only possible if shortfalls in disbursements are not absorbed in urgentnew commitments.Reduction of military Expenditure Overseas1J+2+.   We understand that Ministers are planning considerablesavings under this head both in Germany and elsewhere.
Part VIII;    Summary145     Introduction.     The Working Party was asked to examine the major elements in the balance of payments, with special referenceto the invisible account, to identify trends and consider suggestions for remedial action.     This First Report indicates in broad terms the Working Party&apos;s conclusions on the general trend of thebalance of payments and the broad remedial action required,leaving specific remedies for a later report.      The survey covers the period 1952 to 1960 and ahead over the next few years.146*   Part I;    Visible Trade.      &apos;The visible deficit fell somewhatbetween 1952-54 and 1958-60.     But it is unlikely that there wouldhave been this improvement if the terms of trade had not moved infavour of the United Kingdom.      Continued favourable movement ofthe terms of trade is unlikely.      In the absence of such help fromthe terms of trade, nothing in the experience of the last ten yearsprovides any warrant for believing that we can expect a reductionin the visible trade deficit, unless there are substantial changesin policy.147.   Part II;    Invisible account.     A surplus of invisible earningshas been a normal feature of the balance of payments throughout thepresent century.      Just before and not long after the war it was runnin at  300 million a year.     By 1960 the invisible surplushad all but disappeared.     Between 1952 and 1960 the principalfactors in the deterioration were the following.     There was alarge fall in net earnings from shipping.     A number of reasonswere responsible, in particular the capacity of the United Kingdommerchant fleet being outstripped by the expansion of United kingdom trade and by that of foreign fleets.     Overseas Government expenditureincreased rapidly, mainly on defence.     Under the head of interest,profits and dividends, the income we paid abroad on foreigninvestments in this country, including interest on sterling holdings,
srew more rapidly than the income we received from abroad on united Kingdom investments overseas.      Payments and receipts onaccount of travel both increased rapidly, with little change in thenet balance.      There was a substantial increase in net earnings on other items, which embrace many types of overseas transactions ofwhich there is little accurate knowledge.Over the next few years some further deterioration on theGovernment&apos;s expenditure and in shipping earnings is expected,not entirely offset by some relief on interest, profits, and dividends and oil earnings.      Although the future trend must beuncertain, no prospect is seen of a return to the level of netearnings of the early 1.950&apos;s.149. Part III; Long-term capital account. The net outward movementon long-term capital account increased appreciably between 1952and 19S0.      Though partly balanced by lesser resort to the Londoncapital market by countries in the Rest of the Sterling Area,official lending (including repayment of loans) grew apace.      Therewas also a large increase in private investment, both inward andoutward, though the net balance was little changed.     Net officiallending will increase further over the next few years.      And amarked increase in net outward investment on private account alsoseems probable on the rather inadequate evidence available.Within the limits of present policies no relief can be counted upon in this sector of the balance of payments over the next few years,and the probability is that the total net flow of capital abroadwill increase.150. Part IV;    The trend of the balance of payment s as a whole.The total outcome of the balance of payments was significantlyworse on the average of 1958-60 than of 1952-54.      The deteriorationon the identified items was much greater, and the outcome in thelatter period would have been much worse but for the very large
SECRET &apos; 9 9Unidentified receipts of 1960, the larger part of which cannot betaken as likely to continue.151   The rate of net long-term capital investment abroad is alreadyabout  300 million a year.      Net invisible earnings are likely tobe negligible.      Thus,  even after allowing for a normal creditbalancing item of substantial size, a very large annual surplus ofvisible trade would be needed even to achieve balance.     But theprospects for the visible account are that it will continue in deficit.      Thus a massive improvement in the balance of visibletrade is required.152   Part V;    The balance of payments in 1960-62.      The balanceof payments began to deteriorate seriously in 1959, and in 1960the total identified deficit was  545 million.      The reservesincreased, but only because of the huge inflow of funds, and short-term liabilities rose much more, gravely increasing the vulnerability of sterling.153    In the first half of 1961 the current account has improvedsubstantially, though still in deficit, and the long-term capital account has benefited from the Pord investment of some  130 million.Following the revaluation of the German and Dutch currencies inMarch, the flow of short-term funds was reversed, and an outflowhas since continued.      Despite assistance from other central banks, the reserves fell steeply during the first half of the year -by  164 million to  990 million.154    The Report of the Committee on Balance of Payments Prospectsenvisages an identified deficit of  435 million over the comingtwelve months.     Allowing (notionally) for normal unidentifiedreceipts and for the expected fall in the sterling holdings of theRest of the Sterling Area, the drain on the reserves in theconditions foreseen is likely to be at least  460 million, ofwhich  375 million would come in the second half of this year.Any withdrawal of short-term funds would add to the strain.
155    First and second line reserves of say  1,700 million, partlymortgaged to repay assistance from other central banks, could be effectively exhausted over the next six months.     But a quickprogramme of measures manifestly adequate to bring about enduringequilibrium within a reasonable period could restore confidence and give more time to put matters right.256   Part VI;    Diagnosis.      The United Kingdom&quot;s experience hasdiffered from that of most other major industrial countries, not inthat payments overseas - visible and invisible - have risen, but inthat receipts have not risen to match.      The proximate causes of thedecline in invisible earnings have been explained.     Attention is,therefore, concentrated on the balance of visible trade, which must bear the brunt of readjustment.157    Failure.to do better on visible trade must have been due to;(i)    not producing enough of the goods in most demand,   (ii)    costs of production being too high, or (iii)    not striving hard enough to compete with foreign producers.       Each of these has played a part.158    Competitiveness is a complex quality and hard to measure.Price is all important.      Conclusive evidence about whether theUnited Kingdom is competitive in price is not forthcoming.     Whileover a wide range of goods exports evidently have been competitive,there are indications that the margin of competitiveness isshrinking.      If prices had been lower, more might have been sold.The lack of a positive wage policy contributed to the worseningof the trade balance.      Excess demand has reinforced cost inflation.I59   The pressure of home demand has been too great, too large ashare of resources going to satisfy home demand and too little tosatisfy demand from abroad.     Too easy selling conditions at homeundermined the will to compete abroad.     There has been a closecorrelation between the pressure of home demand in relation to capacity on the one hand and the movement of the visible trade balance on the other, closer for imports than for exports.     This
favours the conclusion that a lower pressure of home demand wouldhave meant a better visible balance.160.   Part VII;    Remedies     The first and pressing need is for asubstantial immediate check to the growth of home demand to remove the overload on the economy and free resources needed to improve the balance of payments both in the form of larger exports and in place of imports.    Thereafter we should permanently keep home demand at a lower level in relation to our productive capacity than has been the practice since the war,161.    It is also of the utmost importance that the Government shouldtake a strong initiative in the field of wage-settlement with theobject of delaying wage increases for a time and thereafter of keeping increases in line -with general productivity growth.    Thisshould enable us to &quot;price ourselves back into&quot; world markets.162.   We do not consider these policies inimical to a reasonablerate of long-term economic growth.Devaluation would not provide a solution to our difficulties and indeed would add to them;    but we might be forced into it ifwe failed to take adequate internal measures.We recommend a continuation of the export drive in the context of new consultations with industry on growth and efficiency.We do not think import restrictions would help at the present justice.We favour certain other emergency measures bearing directlyon the balance of payments;    restrictions on overseas investment and retention of profits;    and cuts in the Government&apos;s overseas expenditure on defence.C.1059-61
