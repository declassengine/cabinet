No.    2 8^LWM 1 /if September, 1961CABINET|f$i    Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ^LmmWLWM My colleagues will wish to have an account of the present situation regarding^k-w Berlin.^LWM |re The Situation^L*M 2.  On 12th August the sector border between East and West Berlin wasmL^M -^osed by the East German authorities in order to stop the westward flow of^k-W refugees which had begun to run at the rate of about a thousand a day. Ten days^k-W * steer, on 22nd August, severe restrictions were placed on the movement of West^k-W Germans and West Berliners in both directions across the sector border. Allied^LWm I personnel and foreigners were also affected to some extent.   Throughout these^Jlitions the East Germans took care to avoid interference with communications^k-W ?. between West Berlin and West Germany and there seemed to be a careful policym\\\\ SillP&quot;not attacking Allied rights as such.   However, on 23rd August the SovietGovernment addressed a Note to the Three Powers protesting against Allied&quot; *J|misuse &quot; of the air corridors, thus giving grounds for the fear that they intended^kWM I to begin to interfere with this traffic.VWL-M 3.  These moves led to a sharp rise in international tension and it was legitimate^mm% J f^fco speculate whether Mr. Khrushchev might have decided to advance them\\\\ ^Sjppgranime which he had hitherto set, which was to &quot; settle &quot; the Berlin problemI before the end of the year by concluding a separate peace treaty with East Germany.General de Gaulle took the view that the Note on abuse of the air corridors was so^LWW IB ,,jjpttster that he wanted to issue a ringing challenge to Mr. Khrushchev then and there^LWW lm I calling upon him to choose between peace and war. We (and I think all the other^L\m\ m\        Allies) took a different view, which seems so far to have been justified by the event.We thought it more probable that the measures taken by the East German authoritieslm PH ^ Deen ^n trie ^rs^- instance forced on them by the increase in the flow of refugeesmk and the deteriorating situation in East Germany; and that after the initial stepH I (he Soviets, finding that the Western reaction was not too drastic, had decided toWXjM ;Jw further minor acts of restriction and to make further threats, primarily as al/ffcahs of strengthening their position for an eventual negotiation. Other moves of^LXjm . ]^H|nilar character may well follow in the weeks to come, in order to increase theSfessures on the West and to give the Soviet negotiators points which they can^LWM ls^r &quot; concede &quot;. It is possible, for example, that the inter-zonal trade agreement^LWm maM break down and that there may be interference with West Berlin&apos;s trade andWMMMM harassment of its communications with the West.U.  The people of East Germany are now effectively caged in and despite^LXjm reports of widespread discontent there is no sign of any effective movement of[|0J8istence. We have of course been extremely careful not to encourage any such^Lmm I Ht&amp;yvtTnent as it would certainly be ruthlessly suppressed, a process which wouldV^\9M ? causefhe gravest situation on the borders of East and West Germany. The Federal H^LWM Government, too, have been very cautious over this. West Berlin is now almost^1 Sli&apos; 1 SECRET i? i 5*613 ?
SECRET Vwholly isolated from East Berlin and from the surrounding Deutsche Demokratische  m ^Lw Republik (D.D.R.).  The &quot; shop window &quot; has its blinds down and the escape/|Jp ^Lw\route or safety valve from East Germany is closed. To this extent therefore West IffBerlin is less dangerous to East Germany than it was and at least one of the main &apos;3jjkSoviet complaints about the existence of free communications between West Berlin jand the Federal Republic (namely, that it was used to carry refugees) has been   II ^Lwm-WaW removed. This could make the negotiation of a settlement easier.  Against this,&quot; ^^flhowever, the local situation in Berlin itself is certainly fraught with danger and I^LwM the Russians may at any time renew their protests that our aircraft carrftf^Lwm &quot; revanchist&quot; West Germans and demand that the practice be stopped under them^-M threat of closure. -AwWestern Policy ^^fl(a) Move Towards Negotiation5.  Throughout these events and since the Paris meeting of Western Foreign ^-W.^Lmm Ministers in July, we have been trying to obtain Four-Power agreement on a moveAmJM towards negotiation with the Soviet Tjnion. This was one part of the two-barrelled -AMpolicy outlined by the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Rusk, on behalf ofthe President at Paris-namely a policy of building up military strength on theone hand and being ready to negotiate on the other.   My colleagues should ^Lm\understand the significance of the adoption of this policy by President Kennedy. mmmHitherto the idea of &quot; negotiating &quot; over Berlin had been considered as almostequivalent to treason and much obloquy had been cast on Her MajestyYj, ^-W.Government by American and other commentators for our alleged inclinationtowards it.  At Paris not only did Mr. Rusk say that President Kennedy wasdetermined to negotiate, but he insisted that a public move to this end must be made ^-W.before the end of August. Furthermore the American Delegation stated in termsthat, although they considered the freedom of West Berlin and the maintenanc^fe! mmm^Lmm of the Allied position there to be vital American interests, they were not prepareMJ ^LwAto go to war for the reunification of Germany or over theoretical issues relatijjK&apos;&apos;to the recognition of the D.D.R. (e.g., who stamps the documents, &amp;c).  At the^^fl same time Mr. Rusk made it clear that the President did not support plans (which   ] ^Lm\had been giving us so much concern over the previous year) for large-scaj#;f I AmW,operations up the autobahn in the event of interference with Allied access. ^Lmg^L^LX 6.  We naturally welcomed wholeheartedly this evolution of American jthinking on the Berlin problem and tried to give our full support to both barrels ^Lmgof their policy.   On the negotiation side we have consistently supported thePresident&apos;s desire for a public move in this direction to be made before1st September. There has been dogged opposition from General de Gaulle.  By   | ^^flthe time my colleagues read this paper some public statement will, I trust, havebeen made by the United States Government and we shall have supported it; buf^fI cannot yet tell whether the French will consent to be associated with it. ^Lmm(b) The Build-up of Strength7.  The build-up of strength has been more difficult for us. I do not thinkthat we can contest the reasoning behind American policy.  Mr. Khrushchev is ^Lmgin an arrogant bullying mood and if he thought he could get away with noopposition he would end the life of West Berlin now.   The Americans hayetherefore advocated a substantial increase in the conventional power of the NojraKAtlantic Alliance, for two purposes, namely (a) as a means of pressure onMr. Khrushchev pending negotiations, and (b) in order to give the Alliance a wm&apos;( ^L^LXrange of military counter-action for use as a last resort (and after trying an airlift ^Lmgand non-military counter-measures) if all kinds of negotiations, including theUnited Nations, fail. We accepted this and I told my colleagues in Paris that Half&apos; ^LWMI Majesty&apos;s Government were willing to send certain units (including a Surface-to-AirUjmM Guided Weapons regiment) to Germany; to retain existing fighter squadronsMr -AmI Germany and send additional fighter aircraft; to earmark a squadron of Canbejfljp^ Iaircraft with nuclear capacity; and to organise forces in the United Kingdom imp a Idivision including armour which would be held available for reinforcement inEurope. Under arrangements made by the Minister of Defence, these steps havesince been announced by stages and are being put into effect. A small number ofadditional armoured vehicles has also been sent to Berlin.SECRET I piMI I
r I^LM SECRET,; | WMmmm llr   / These measures have been just enough to prevent our being criticised by mWMmmm\ iiP,r /mes UP to ^-ne Present- They do not, however, represent a significant increase WXWMWkwM I in tfi effective strength of the British Army of the Rhine (B.A.O.R.) and they doMwU f&apos;^tfuffice to meet requests which are now being addressed to us (and to the other ^LwM^LMM fa&apos;p^Jiibers of the Alliance) by the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, for additional mXWM^LMM I m^tary effort. On the other hand, I understand that there is very little more we^LMM do without calling up reserves and introducing some form of compulsory WxwM^LMM military service. This is one of the main problems confronting us at present. wkwMjflfc) Economic Counter-Measures ^-\\\^LMM 9.  The American Memorandum of 21st July (C. (61) 117) proposed that the ^Mjm^MwM J Alliance should make a number of advance preparations in all fields, so as to be ^mw\^MwM I able to meet any eventuality with a choice of a wide range of options, and with ^mw\^LwM j military action as a last resort. It argued that in the event of blockage of our access^LwM to B^lin we should be prepared to take severe economic counter-measures against wWMWmmW \ the p&gt;viet bloc in support of an air-lift and political and diplomatic activity. The ^LmWi^mwA idea was that we might persuade the Russians to desist from their action by means ^mw\^LwM short of military action leading ultimately to all-out war. This was very close to ^mw\^mmm\ I the policy already approved by the Defence Committee in June. ^LwMmmm F*ff         These proposals were discussed in Paris. The result was agreement that ^mWWwM in tM event of complete blockage of military and civilian access, by air or ground, WmwM^mwM , significant economic counter-measures amounting to a total economic embargo ^mwi^MwM would have to be applied. It was also agreed that appropriate measures to meet ^mwi^mwM I&apos;jltuations short of a complete blockage should be studied in Washington; and that mm\mt^mwM j; the^fjjur Governments would immediately undertake the necessary legislative and ^mwlmmm o|j|^Bpstrative dispositions required to enable them to act promptly on all these ^mW,%%%%% [&apos;Measures if and when it was agreed to put them into effect. Finally, it was agreed mmmWt^mWM that these proposals should be put to the North Atlantic Alliance, so that other mmmW^MwM members of the Alliance could make similar plans, since few of the measures inWmwM question would be of any value unless applied by the Alliance as a whole. ^mwlmmmt I&apos;*\ fP-  Work is going ahead very fast in Washington, and will soon begin to ^mwlI v&lt;Ww^P raPidly in the Alliance. Unless we can clear our own minds without delay ^mfiM-Mml we shall not be in a position to influence this.  We have made it clear, both in W-wt^mwM Washington and in the Alliance, that economic counter-measures, and especially ^mwA^mwM those which may have an effect on sterling, present special difficulties for us. We ^mwA^mwM I cannot afford to seem to our Allies reluctant to play our full part in this field. mmmW^LwM (The Americans see economic counter-measures as an essential element in avoiding ^mW.mWU &apos; all-out war if a crisis becomes serious, and we have accepted this. If we (and other ^mW^kwm pfcmbers of the Alliance) show unwillingness to take these measures, the Americans ^mWM^kwm may well return to theories of military measures at an earlier stage, acting alone if ^mwM^LwM j necessary. This would be infinitely more disastrous to us than the imposition of ^LwM^kwm economic measures.  The Annex to this paper contains a summary of the more WmM^kwm | important measures now being discussed in Washington and gives a commentary%%%%% on them.^mWA 1 The Future12.  It is quite clear that we are going to have negotiation of some sort with^^11 P^e Soviet Union before the end of the year. It will be very tough and difficult. W-wWmWU Mr. Khrushchev is in a thoroughly overweaning and dangerous frame of mindand believes that he has, in Berlin, an issue over which all the local factors are^mwM favourable to him. The question is whether he can be persuaded, by the resolute^MwM conduct, the unity and growing strength of the Alliance, that he cannot obtain the^mwM whole of his demands but must be content with a settlement which does not^mwM humiliate the West. The military build-up has one obvious danger. It creates aWwM crisis atmosphere which in itself makes negotiation more difficult and concessions^MwM in negotiation more of a defeat. But in my view, the measures taken by President^LwM Kennedy to increase American preparedness are right and necessary as part of^LwM his preparations for a negotiation and the Allies ought to do whatever they can to^LwM &apos; match this and to show their support of the North Atlantic Alliance. HermWM Majesty&apos;s Government have an important role of leadership in this. We are verymWU close to the Americans on the whole problem and even the Federal German1 Chancellor, Dr. Adenauer, whose attitude, despite coming elections, has been^LwM rational and cautious. Our contribution so far has been very modest. The Minister^LwM of Defence will be able to advise what if any more can be done.SECRET
Basis for Negotiation                                                              -l \ &gt; ^LX-W^^^b                   13.  On what basis shall we negotiate?   This is now the central problem!!^^^j              which we must face in the coming weeks and which I shall be discussing with rajPji:^^^j             three colleagues at the meeting for Western Foreign Ministers which hasArral&amp;j^^^j been called for 14th September in Washington. It has hitherto been assumed \thd)r\ ^L\\\\^----W              the opening position which the West would have to adopt in any negotiation wfculd j^^^1              be based on the Western Peace Plan of 1959 suitably brought up to date.  II am j ^L-Wnot at all sure that this is now the right tactic. There is something to be said Jot I ^L\\\\avoiding the inevitable recriminations of a debate about self-determination ^m\\\\reunification and concentrating negotiation on the narrowest front, namely that Off fAllied presence and uninterrupted access. I tried to avoid discussing the SUDs^w^Hof the Berlin problem before the German elections because I believe that after -J ^L-Mthey are safely elected a German Government will be less rigid in their appr&lt;$ach ! ^L\Wto a settlement. But under strong pressure from the Americans I have agreed&apos; to j; ^L\\\a meeting on 14th September. ^L-M14. My colleagues will recall an earlier paper (C.

^Lm secret ^Lm\\\\\ ANNEXECONOMIC GOUNTERMEASURES \m\\\\j It was agreed in Paris that in the event of a complete blockageJ of military and civilian access, by air or ground, significant economiccounter measures amounting to a total economic embargo would haveto be employed against the Soviet bloc (China is not included). Thisis understood to mean that in the contingency envisaged countries inthe North Atlantic Alliance would all begin to mount significant| economic countermeasures along with an airlift, diplomatic activityand the mobilisation of conventional forces.    By the time a decisionwas taken to use these forces a wide range of countermeasures would ^^^Hprogressively have been employed and when that decision was takenI all countries would fill the remaining gaps to make up a total :&apos;^^Hembargo. gj Lj2.   The following are the more important countermeasures suggestedin the contingency of a complete blockage:-(a) extend export control measures against Soviet bloccountries, including a selective embargo leadingup to (e) below;I (b)   suspend existing contracts to charter shipping toSoviet bloc countries;(c) close allied ports and airports to Soviet bloc shippingI and civil aircraft;(d) terminate trade agreement involving Soviet blocmembers; ^^^H(e) institute total trade embargo, i.e., complete denial ^^^Hby members of the Alliance of all their exports toand imports from Soviet bloc countries;I (f)   cut off all financial facilities from members of the ^^^HAlliance to the Soviet Union and other Soviet ^^^Hbloc members} ^^^HWL%M   I (g)   freeze all Soviet bloc financial assets under the ^^^Hjurisdiction of the Alliance Powers. ^^^H| It was also agreed that appropriate economic measures to meet ^^^hI situations short of a complete blockage should be studied. ^^^h-mWWM 3.   A complete economic embargo against the Soviet bloc would cause ^^^h^-9M much greater damage to the West than to the East.    The Soviet Union ^^^hitself would be affected only to the extent that the rate of its future ^^^hm\\m 1 -i-^K^l secret ^^^fl
j secret ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^BII If   * IHi I;development would be reduced, and that not for some two or three1 years.    Its current standard of living would not be affected. Theonly Soviet bloc countries to feel the pinch would be East Germany j^^HI and Poland.1 4.   The West, on the other hand, would be vulnerable to the effectof its own measures and to any retaliatory economic measures whichSoviet bloc Governments might impose.    For most of the countriesI of the West these boomerang effects might not be serious but theeffects on the interests of some of them, including the United1 Kingdom, could be grave and relatively quick.    For example, theloss of our imports of Soviet soft wood and manganese would compel] us to turn to other expensive markets.    Our export trade with theI Soviet bloc is of the order of  100 millions a year (direct exports)and  35 millions a year (re-exports).    As far as shipping isI concerned, it is clear that countries in the Alliance with much more j^^Hshipping at stake are likely to suffer very much greater harm than the il^^HSoviet bloc once each side starts to interfere with the other&apos;s shipping.The long-term effects on the United Kingdom shipping interestsI would be particularly serious.I 5.   Moreover, in the view of the Treasury the freezing of Sovietbloc assets would involve grave consequences for sterling, even apartfrom the adverse effects of the Berlin situation generally. TheJ damage would be particularly serious superimposed on our presenteconomic difficulties.    If the embargo were not in the event followed] by war we should emerge with our financial and economic strengthgreatly weakened.    The Bank of England wish to record that they arej completely and utterly opposed to the freezing of sterling balances.If this was coincident with the outbreak of war it could be accepted,J but any suggestion that assets should be frozen during a period ofnegotiations perhaps prior to war is regarded by the Bank of Englandf as doing the greatest disservice to sterling at a time when it isI perhaps on the point of recovery from a severe setback.I 6.   The situation envisaged in Paris was that access to Berlin,both civilian and military, would be completely blocked; in suchI circumstances, allied forces would be locked up in Berlin and itwould be apparent that the Soviet Union, despite all our efforts, wasI determined to squeeze Berlin out altogether.    War would thereforebe imminent.    In this very grave contingency, the dangers to j^^HI sterling and to our trade which would follow from the more severe ^^^Hj of the countermeasures contemplated would have to be accepted. Ifwar did not ensue, the grave consequences described in thej preceding paragraph would have to be set against the advantagesof having avoided armed conflict.^L-W J 7.   We should obtain little relief by attempting to apply theembargo to selected items only.    The Soviet bloc might retaliate byI stopping its purchases of other items from us or its own exportsof the items which we can least afford to lose.    Moreover, we could ^^^1^?^L^ ^i.-. secret ^Lm
II! 1* IMfai not in any case afford to make purchases from the Soviet bloc if we ^^^Hhad substantially reduced our exports, since this would involve usdirectly or indirectly in net gold payments.8.   It has been suggested that the most effective means of leadingup to a total embargo, with the maximum of adverse effects on theSoviet bloc as compared with the West and the United Kingdom inparticular, would be to begin by imposing restrictions on trade withEast Germany only.    On balance such a measure would hurt EastGermany much more than it hurt countries in the Alliance. Ourrepresentatives in Washington have therefore been instructed tosuggest such a course as a countermeasure to be applied ifnecessary at a relatively early stage, the application of the moresevere measures against the Soviet bloc as a whole being withheldto the very last stage.    The initial reaction of the Americans is ^^^H^LWW unfavourable, but an opportunity -will shortly occur to put our/ &apos; suggestions at a higher level, if this seems desirable. ^^^HSeptember, 1961 ^^^H^^^^^ ^^^^^^^__secret_
