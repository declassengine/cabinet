(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 10218th July, 1961CABINETTRADE UNION ELECTIONSMemorandum by the Minister .o  labour I have been considering the points made at our meeting on13th July (C. C. (61) 40th Conclusions, Minute 4) and the proposals inthe memorandum by the Attorney-General (C. (61) 99).-2.      I had an informal talk with Mr. Woodcock, the General Secretaryof the Trades Union Congress (T. U. C. ) on 1-lth July.    He is pre-occupied at present with the clash of personalities within the electrical trades Union which has arisen from the High Court Judgment. - I found him unwilling to accept that there is need for general action, andhe intimated that the Trades Union Congress would probably regardany proposal to legislate on the subject of trade union elections as anattack on the independence of the unions.    Nevertheless, I hope thatthe T. U. C. can be persuaded to take a broader view of their responsibilities.    I believe that when the matter is discussed by theT. U. C. (and I have ensured that it will be discussed) there may be some support for the view that action is required and should, if possible, betaken by the unions themselves.3.     But any legislation which can be interpreted, howeverunreasonably, as infringing the independence of unions would be strongly opposed by all trade union leaders.    I recognise that thepowers which the Attorney-General proposes to give to the Registrarto examine and report on rules and to conduct elections if requestedare limited.    Indeed, they are both logical and reasonable.    I amcertain, however, that the trade unions would regard them as aserious attack on their independence and that they would be completelyunacceptable to the T. U. C.4.     Some trade union leaders will, without doubt, regard my own proposals as an attack on the unions.    The extremists may use them as an excuse for urging a policy of all-out opposition to the Govern-ment.    But these proposals clearly leave untouched the rights oftrade unions to make and operate their own election rules.    I would think that many moderate trade union leaders and members would consider them not unreasonable.    Even if we disagreed with theT. U. C. about the need for the legislation, there is a reasonable chance that this would-ribt develop into a full-scale clash between the Govern-ment and the whole trade union movement.COPY NO.
5.      With the prospect of serious conflict on the industrial frontthis autumn, which the exigencies and our economic situation will compel us to face firmly, I think it is important that we should avoid a majorquarrel with the unions over this issue.    I recommend that if, as seems likely, legislation is necessary, it should be on the lines proposed inmy memorandum C. (61) 95.J.H.Ministry of Labour, S. W. 1.17th July, 1961.-2-
