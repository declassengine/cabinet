THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly J^mitecLIt is issued for the personal use of.......TOP SECRETC.(6l) 11827th July. 1961CABINETBERLIN:   MILITARY ASPECTSMemorandum by the Minister of DefenceUnited States policyPresident Kennedy&apos;s recent statement shows a more flexibleand more realistic approach to the Berlin problem and places the emphaon deterrence and negotiations from a position oC strength.   In themilitary field we can welcome the American wish, to include the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A. T. O.) in military preparations andtheir readiness to consider an airlift as well as military operationsalong the autobahn to maintain Allied access to Berlin.   They alsoappear to be more flexible in their thinking about the &quot;Live Oak&quot;operations.    In all these changes the Americans1 vi.nws now appear tocoincide with our own.2. In support of this policy the Americans propose to take stepsto increase their military strength, especially in the conventionalfield (see C.(6l) 117).   They also expect their N.A. T.O. Allies toincrease their force contributions to the Alliance by the end of 1961to the levels set out in M. C. 70 (Minimum Essential Force Require-ments, 1958-63).   They consider that this increase in N.A. T. O.military strength together with an obvious reinforcement capabilityand with strategic nuclear forces at a high state of readiness will notonly strengthen the West&apos;s negotiating position but will also open upto the West a greater choice of military action and enable the Westto choose their own time to respond to Soviet moves,3. The United States Government take the view that the increasein N.A. T. O. military strength must be maintained, if necessary, fora considerable period.   The steps they propose to take, therefore,are not temporary expedients; for example they propose to increasethe size of their drafts, not to call up reservists or mobilise theirNational Guard.What the United Kingdom is expected to do4. The Americans look to us to bring the British Army of theRhine (B. A. O. R. ) up to 55, 000 men and to have available in the UnitedKingdom a further division that could be flown out to Germany atshort notice.   B. A. O. R. , even at this strength, would not be on a fullwar footing and in an emergency it would have to be reinforced fromthe United Kingdom.   The Americans also expect us to take comparablesteps to their own to strengthen our air and naval forces and to improveCopy No--1-TOP SECRET
TOP SECRETtheir states of readiness.   Mr. McNamara, the United States Secretaryof Defence, however in his recent talks with me stressed only theB. A. O. R. requirements.Implications for the United Kingdom5. In the last resort it is the military preparations of the UnitedStates that will influence the Soviet Government, provided the UnitedStates has the clear and wholehearted support of her N. A. T. O. Allies:the preparations made by the United Kingdom will probably not ofthemselves decisively influence Soviet policy.   The purpose of ourpreparations, therefore, within acceptable manpower and financiallimits, should be to demonstrate our solidarity with the United Stateson Berlin.   We should seek to take the initiative in introducing certainmeasures and to avoid any appearance of merely following an Americanlead.6. In order to meet the American requirements in full:-(a) B. A. O. R. would have to be brought up to a strength of55, 000 by the end of 1961 and maintained at that strength for a considerableperiod; this would require an additional 5, 000 - 8, 000 men.(b) Two or three brigade group* would have to be held in theUnited Kingdom with adequate air transport facilities for a move atshort notice to Germany-  these would either have to be existingformations in the Strategic Reserve or, to avoid restricting out abilityto reinforce overseas, new formations would have to be created.(c) Arrangements would have to be made to recall reservists inan emergency to put B.A. O. R. on a full war-footing.Possible ways of achieving (a) and (c) are discussed in my memorandumC. (61) 115.7. The more important requirements to bring the Royal AirForce (R. A. F.) to M. C. 70 strength are for a long term increase inour tactical air strength in Germany, increased requirements for airtransport, not only for a possible airlift but also to transport thereinforcing division from the United Kingdom to Germany.   It may alsobe necessary at an appropriate stage to place Bomber Command at ahigher state of readiness.   It is unlikely that we shall be able to increasefor any considerable period the numbers of fighters stationed in Germany,but we should now decide to keep in Germany the three fighter squadronsplanned to be withdrawn at the end of this year.   The Chiefs of Staffrecommend that Bomber Command should be brought to a very high stateof readiness only in an emergency that would justify general mobilisation,because the Command could not be held in that state indefinitely.8. There is a requirement for a long-term increase of our navalcontribution to N. A. T. O. to M. C. 70 levels, with particular emphasison anti-submarine forces.   This however is the lowest priority in ourN. A.T.O. requirements for the present situation.   The courses openare either to bring back ships from the Far East or to commissionships in reserve, which would require 4, 000 more men.-2-TOP SECRET
TOP SECRET9. The Americans also call for the establishment of war reservestocks at 90-day operation level, but recognise that something a gooddeal less would be adequate.   They are putting pressure on the Germansto purchase from the United Kingdom what they need to bring their stocksup to a proper level.10. The Chiefs of Staff have put in hand a more detailed studyof the implications of meeting all the United States proposals and ofb ringing our forces generally to a war footing.Timing11. The timing of these military steps is important.   The wholeplan includes a much wider series of economic and political measures.The military fcteps should therefore be co-ordinated not only in N.A. T. O.but also with other countermeasures in such a way as to present theSoviet Government with a convincing picture of united and increasingstrength and resolution.   At the same time the We&amp;i should avoidpreparations that might provoke the Soviet Government into action onBerlin that would prejudice a settlement or preparations that mightoffend neutral opinion.Cost12. It will cost money to respond to the American call forincreased military preparedness.   The additional oversea cost:) inGermany would be of the order of  700 per head per annum.   T&apos;ie extraforeign exchange cost might be offset to some extern by purchasesin this country for German war reserves.   It has not yet been possibleto estimate the cost of the measures discussed in paragraphs  6 to 9above.Conclusion13. To meet the American requirement our available forces wouldhave to be strengthened, perhaps for a considerable period.   This rulesout any extensive use of reservists.   But clearly, we should respondas far as we can to this American approach both to demonstrate ourunity and because it is much more flexible and much more sensible thananything they have previously put forward.Recommendations14. I accordingly ask my colleagues:-(a) To take note of the broad implications of the military preparationsthe Americans expect us to make.(b) To take note that I will report further on the study put in handby the Chiefs of Staff and on the estimated cost of these preparations.(c) To consider ways of overcoming the manpower difficulties of thelong term increase in the strength of our forces suggested by the Americans.(d) To agree that the three fighter squadrons should not be withdrawnfrom Germany at the end of this year.H.
