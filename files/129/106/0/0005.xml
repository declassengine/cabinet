SECRET21(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 105 COPY NO.    it18th July, 1961CABINETBRITISH SUGAR corporation memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and food on 11th May the Cabinet discussed my proposals for a capital reconstruction of the Corporation under which the equity will be held by the sugar Board and the existing Ordinary shares would be converted intoCumulative Preference shares bearing interest at 8 per cent as comparedwith the present rate of 7 per cent.     I was asked to seek the views of the institutions holding shares in the Corporation so that the matter could bediscussed in the light of their views (C. C. (61) 27th Conclusions, Minute 10).The institutions said they were disinclined to consider it until private share-holders had been consulted.    Accordingly, on 6th June, the Cabinet alsoauthorised the Chairman of the Corporation to seek the views of the organised group of private shareholders who were pressing for an increasein the dividend (C. C. (61) 30th Conclusions, Minute 4).2.      The Chairman has now informed me of the results of these consultations, which were made confidentially and without any indication that the Government would accept the proposals.3.      The Shareholders1 Committee have refused to support the scheme asthey do not consider the terms sufficiently favourable.4.      The proposals were then discussed with the Joint Committeeestablished for the purpose by the Investment Trusts and the BritishInsurance Association.    They were informed of the views of the ShareholdersCommittee.    After full discussion the Insurance Committee agreed torecommend to their members the acceptance of the offer.     The InvestmentTrusts Committee, although not at all happy that the proposals were sufficiently favourable to shareholders, were prepared to recommendtheir members not to oppose the scheme (the Insurance Societies holdmore than five times as many shares as the Investment Trusts).5.      The Board of the Corporation have considered the situation in thelight of the views of the Insurance Companies, the Investment Trusts andthe private shareholders, and they consider there is a good chance of getting the necessary majority of 75 per cent of those present and votingat a special General Meeting.6. However, in the atmosphere which the Chancellor of the Exchequerwill be trying to create when he makes his announcement next week, I feel it would be unwise for the Government to sanction a reorganisation which-1-SECRET
would result effectively in an increase of dividend from 7 per cent to per cent.     I am sure we will have to tackle this as soon as we can, but now is not the moment.7.      I have had a talk with the Chairman of the Corporation, and he isagreeable in the circumstances to making the annexed  statement at theAnnual General Meeting which takes place next Tuesday - the same dayas the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposes to make his announcement.C.S.Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food, S. W. 1.18th July, 1961.-2-
annex draft STATEMENT FOR THE ANNUAL GENERALMEETING OF THE BRITISH SUGAR CORPORATIONShareholders will have seen what is said about the position ofthe Corporation^ shares in my statement contained in the Report of the directors and Statement of Accounts.     (The relevant paragraph reads as fallows:-&quot;At the last Annual General Meeting, questions were raisedregarding the possibility of obtaining Ministerial approval to anincrease in dividend above the rate of 7 per cent and of a possiblecapitalisation of reserves.    Subsequently a committee of theBoard had discussions with a Shareholders1 Committee, then formed,and with the Ministry, by whom the Shareholders&apos; Committee had also been received.    As a result it has become clear that inpresent circumstances Ministers would not approve a rate of dividend higher than 7 per cent or a capitalisation of reserves.The Board recognise that there is an element of anomaly in thestatus of the ordinary shares, having regard to the special relationship between the Corporation and the Government, and itis the Board&apos;s intention to continue to explore the possibilitieswhich, subject to shareholders&apos; approval, might remove this.&quot;)I can only add at this stage that discussions have already been held with the Ministry of Agriculture on what   we call in the Report &quot;the element of anomaly in the status of the ordinary shares. &quot;    Whilst I donot at all despair of finding means of regularising the anomaly, I am bound to say that the present national circumstances with which theChancellor of the Exchequer is dealing this afternoon are not appropriate for the promulgation of schemes to this end.     The resolution of this problem must therefore, in the view of your Board, await lessunfavourable conditions.July, 1961
