(THISCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C, (61) 146COPY NO.3rd October, 1961CABINETTRADE UNION ELECTIONSMemorandum by the Minister of LabourSince I last reported to my colleagues (C. (6l) 102), I have had two further talks with Mr. Woodcock, the General Secretary of theTrades Union Congress (T. U. C. ).    On the second occasion he was accompanied, at his suggestion, by the Chairman and some membersof the General Council.    They all spoke very strongly indeed againstlegislation on trade union elections, even if it were limited to givingthe Registrar of Friendly Societies power to hear complaints ofbreaches of their own rules.2. While I think that my proposals would go a long way toprevent a recurrence of ballot-rigging, neither they nor the amendments suggested by the Attorney-General would completely eliminate thepossibility of an unrepresentative minority gaining power (legitimately,on a thin ballot) and thereafter consolidating it by altering the electionrules.    The proposals might therefore lead to pressure to go very much further, and this would involve us in far greater interference with trade union rules and organisation than it might be wise to contemplate.3. It may be that if, as is rumoured, the current electrical trades Union (E. T.U. ) elections result in breaking the Communist hold,the pressure for Government action will be greatly reduced.    Thiswould not be an entirely logical reaction because the E. T. U. case is not so unique as the T.U. C. claim.     The Executive of the amalgamated engineering Union (A. E, U. ), for example, have recently cancelled animportant election on suspicion of unfair practices.     The difference ofcourse is that the A. E.U. Executive have exercised themselves tosecure fair play whereas in the E. T. U. the opposite was the case; butthere are other unions which may be less alive to the danger and otherswhere Communist influence is much stronger.    It seems to me,therefore, that the case for leaving the future to the vigilance of thetrade union movement would be greatly strengthened if the T. U. C.would give some reassurance that they and their constituent unionswill in fact be more vigilant in future, even to the extent of setting up some machinery for appeal to a T.U.C. Committee.     This is some-thing they have not yet contemplated but they might well prefer it to legislation.4. Before we finally decide whether to legislate, I should like to see how the debate develops at the Party Conference on the motion about an inquiry into trade unions.     The results of the E. T. U.elections which should be definitely known at the beginning ofNovember will also be highly relevant.
5. But in any case our own back-benchers are pressingstrongly for Government action on ballot-rigging.    Indeed, I havebeen warned that unless there is reference to this subject inThe Queen&apos;s Speech we may expect a hostile amendment.     i recommend, therefore, that we keep the way open by including a reference to the subject in The queen s Speech and I suggest thatthis should be in the following terms:-&quot;My Government are examining the possibility ofproviding easier redress for breaches of trade unionelection rules. &quot;J.H.Ministry of Labour, s.w.1.2nd October, 1961.
