annex draft OF PASSAGE FOR inclusion in COMMUNICATION TO STAFF SIDE OFCIVIL SERVICE NATIONAL WHITLEY COUNCILDuring the last financial year the increase in personal incomes of all sorts far outstripped the increase in production and productivity.The result has been rising prices and increasing pressure upon thebalance of payments.    It is in the national interest and in the personalinterest of wage earners and salary earners that there should be apause over increases in personal incomes, including wages, salaries and dividends.    The strength of the pound and rising standards ofliving depend upon this.    The country must face the fact that thecoming months will be critical for British competitiveness and for thedevelopment of our economy.    The dangers are very great.2. The Government believe that this grave situation should betaken into account by all concerned with wage negotiations and the fixing of dividends.3.      With regard to those in direct Government employ, each case should be looked at individually, but with the general considerationalready stated borne in mind.    The existing negotiating machinerywill continue to function.    The Government must, however, on grounds of public policy, for the time being reserve to themselves the finaldecision about the timing for putting into effect arbitration awards.  Alternatively - withdraw from arbitrators the timing for putting into effect their awards. /In cases where an offer has already been made, it will be met.August, 1961
