^fl CONFIDENTIALTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT^Lw\ NS 1015/34 Foreign Office and Whitehall DistributionI SOVIET UNION ^t-MWWW   I August 18, 1961Section ^^^HTHE THIRD PROGRAMME OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE^WM SOVIET UNION ^wm^mM  I        A.-Purpose of the Programme1.  The main purposes of the new programme are evidently:^Lwm (i) To provide an authoritative exposition of the mainsprings of Soviet^gM I                      foreign and internal policies over the next 20 years;^mM (ii) to serve as a general guide for party and public on the building ofCommunism in the USSR during this time;^mM I              (iii) to reiterate Soviet leadership of the bloc and to restore elan to the partyWWW and the Soviet system 40 years after the Revolution;^WM (iv) by holding out a vision of a glorious future ahead for the people in Soviet^WM Russia-the highest living standard, the shortest hours in the world-^WM [                       to encourage support for the regime internally and admiration for itfWAW abroad as the &quot; model &quot; to be adopted by all emergent countries.^WM B.-The Importance Khrushchev Attaches to it^WM 2.  The draft of the programme was presented by Khrushchev to the Central^WM Committee on June 19 and published on July 30. (Historically it is the third of a^WM series; the First Programme appeared in 1903 and the Second Programme in 1919.)^WM It is to be discussed by party members at the local and regional level and will beWWjM presented (again by Khrushchev) to the 22nd Congress of the party which opens^WAM in Moscow on October 17. The programme bears Khrushchev&apos;s personal stamp;^WM indeed he claims to have written much of it himself.  He clearly intends to go^WM down in history as the originator of the party programme which is to pave the-WjW way for the present generation of Soviet citizens to live under Communism.^WM C.-Significant Points in the Programme^W-W I         General ToneWWW 2.  The new programme adheres strictly to time-honoured Marxist thought^WM and jargon; there is a complete absence of any new ideas; issues are presented in^WM black and white; and the general tone is militantly assertive.   The capitalist^W-W I          countries are depicted in old-fashioned Communist terms as those in which theWMW rich get richer and the poor get poorer, the purchasing power of the workers^WM lagging behind production and the working class increasingly exploited by ever^W-W more wicked capitalists.  Evidence from the world of reality which disturbs this^WM I          picture is summarily dismissed as an isolated or superficial phenomenon.tWAW Everything under capitalism is evil and doomed; everything under Communism^W-W is good and thriving.   The programme is informed with the usual absolute^WM confidence in the historical inevitability of the final victory of Communism.-WjW The Crisis of Capitalism and Victory of Communism WWjW^L\WM 4.  World capitalism is said to have entered a third new stage of crisis (the^WM first two stages having coincided with the two world wars): &quot; the world capitalist^WM I         system as a whole is ripe for a social revolution of the proletariat&quot;. The UnitedWWW I    jr    States,   the  strongest  capitalist  Power,   &quot; has  passed   its  zenith&quot;. Themum i        &quot; contra(iictions &quot; foreseen by Marx are increasing both between the various classesin each capitalist country and between one capitalist country and another, so thatI         there is a deepening conflict between States and increasing rivalry.5. It is affirmed that the transition from capitalism to &quot; Socialism &quot; can takeplace only through a revolution, which may be either peaceful or violent, accordingto whether the &quot; reactionary circles &quot; put up little or much resistance.  But thisCONFIDENTIAL^WM 19433-267 273-60
CONFIDENTIAL j ^flrevolution must be a native product; there is an emphatic warning that any attempt ^LmW^-wm               at the forcible export of revolution is not only undesirable but liable to be counter- I \mmjmproductive (this is an obvious warning to China).  At the same time workers in ^LmmWLwMM              the capitalist world are called on to thwart any attempt at counter-revolution by ^LmW-mWWM               advocating the liquidation of foreign military bases and non-participation in I \mmja^-WM               military blocs.  One possibly significant new line is that in certain countries the ^mjMWMMM               bourgeoisie may wish to sell out to the proletariat, and that the proletariat may ImWfM               find it advantageous to take over from them on this basis; this seems to be nearer   ^* H \mmm\evolution than revolution. ^LWm6.  The &quot; world Socialist system &quot; is described as &quot; confidently marching \mmjMtowards decisive victory&quot;.   Its economic development is rapid and steady: ^L^WWLWMM               &quot; one-third of mankind is building a new life under the banner of scientific I wk\jMCommunism &quot;.  The only slight anomaly is Yugoslavia, which at first embarked \mmjmon the road to Socialism but later went astray. ^LWmw\*MM               Main Theme: Transition from Socialism to Communism I-WLWM                    7.  The main theme of the programme is the transition of the Soviet Union I \mjM^-wM              from &quot; Socialism &quot; (i.e., the epoch of comparative stringency, governed by Marx&apos;s ^mjMWLmM              slogan &quot; from each according to his ability, to each according to his work &quot;) to ^L\m\-wWWM               &quot; Communism &quot; (i.e., the age of plenty, in which the rule will be &quot; from each I \%%jmaccording to his ability, to each according to his needs &quot;). But it should be noted ^L\m\WLWMm              that the programme does not say that full Communism will be achieved in 20 years, ^L\m\-mWWM              nor does it even fix a definite date for this event.  The most that is claimed is I \m%m^-wM              that &quot; the present generation of Soviet people will live under Communism.  By ^mmWWLwMM               1980 &quot; the Communist society will be basically built in the USSR &quot; but the^-wM              &quot; completion of the building of the Communist society will occur in the subsequent I \mmjmEconomic Targets, Reduction of Hours and Increase in Living Standards ^XwM-jk^M                    (A more detailed analysis of these sections of the programme is given in the I wk\m\Annex.) ^mmm8.  The economic section of the programme does little more than sketch out ^-\m\WLMm              targets, without explaining how they are to be achieved. It offers a vision, not a ^L^W^-9M              blue-print.  Industrial production is to increase six times by 1980 (implying an I Wmmjmannual average rate of growth of about 9 per cent.). The programme contains two ^H\jMWLwMM              quite different formulations about surpassing United States production.  One of ^-\m\these, which claims that by 1970 Soviet industrial production will surpass the I Wm\m\^mmm present United States figure, is probably attainable. But the other, which claims ^LmWWMM              that by 1970 the USSR will surpass the United States 1970 figure of industrial^-wM              production per head of the population, seems to presuppose an unrealistically high H WmmWM^-9M              rate of growth in the Soviet Union and to make insufficient allowance for United \mmjMWlMM              States growth. ^kmm^L%m                    9.  Crude steel production is planned to give a figure of 250 million tons by ^-\m\wk^M              1980.  This is about two and a half times as much as the United States peak ^XwM^LWW              production figure of 1955, and is roughly equivalent to three-quarters of the present E WmmWM^L%m              total world output. ^LWM^LWm                    10.  In general the programme is characterised by a blind faith in the capacity iwLWM              of science and technology, especially mechanisation and automation, to produce ^-\m\M-WM              ever greater output and ever shorter working hours. A 34-36-hour working week ^LXjm^LWW              is to be introduced by 1970; and there is to be a further unspecified reduction by 1 WLmW^LWM              1980. &quot; Thus the Soviet Union will become the country with the shortest and at ^H\jMwk^M              the same time the most productive and most highly-paid working day in the ^LWm^L*M I wkWM11.  The agricultural targets are even more ambitious than the industrial ones. I i^^H^L\m\              Thus in 20 years the production of grain is to be doubled, that of milk increased H^L^W              at least three times, and that of meat four times-all this in defiance of the fact that ? -WLWMWm\m\              production of these commodities has in practice scarcely risen at all since 1958. ^k-9MOverall agricultural production is planned to increase by 6-7 per cent, per annum^L\m              during the next 20 years-a figure that must be compared with the current rate I WLWM^m\m             of increase of about 1 - 4 per cent, per annum.      M I Wm\\\CONFIDENTIAL ^LM
CONFIDENTIAL                                     3 ^LW^L-U 12.  Specific targets for increased living standards include the provision of ^L\\\^L-U a flat per family (free by 1980), free local transport, and a series of free services ^L\\\^L-W including canteen lunches and medicine. By 1980 social services will account for ^L\\\^L-W about half the real income of the population. ^L-W^L-W I              13.  There has obviously been some worry over incentives. The drafters of ^L\W^L-M ? the programme have been anxious that the necessary stimulus to increased output ^L\\\^L-M I r    should not be undermined by the promise of free services.  To meet this it is ^L\W^L-W I *&quot;    explicitly stated that over the next two decades payment will be according to ^L-M^L-W labour, i.e., not according to need as provided by &quot; Communism&quot;. ^L\\\^L-W The Communist Party of the Soviet Union ^L-M^L-M 14.  The supremacy of the Communist Party is reaffirmed. It is the &quot; brains,^L-M the honour and the conscience of our epoch &quot; and the 20-year period covered by ^L\\\^L-M the programme is to be &quot; characterised by a further growth of the role and ^L\\\^L-M importance of the party &quot;. Significantly, the programme asks for an &quot; increase in ^L-M-\-\-\ the role and influence of the party in the armed forces&quot;. ^L-M^L-W 15.  New provision is made for the systematic replacement of all party ^L\\\^L-W I          officials at fixed intervals, amounting to as much as half the membership of lower ^L-W^L-M committees and a quarter of the Praesidium and Central Committee at each ^L-Mt^L-W election.   A similar system of compulsory rotation is prescribed for public ^L-M^L-M organisations and local councils (paragraph 22 below). It is also provided in the ^L-Mprogramme that no official can serve for more than three terms, though there is a ^L-W^L-M loophole for those with exceptional qualities to be able to serve longer. ^L-W^L-W 16.  These organisational changes, which have not been embodied in ^L-W^L-W published statistics, are presumably intended to show that the party cannot ^L-MuMmmW degenerate into a bureaucracy, and may in fact help to discourage empire-building ^L-W^L-W at the lower levels. Normal attrition in the Praesidium and Central Committee is ^L-Mprobably more than that provided by the new stipulations. A lot will depend on ^L-W^L-W how liberally or illiberally the provision permitting exceptions to the three ^L-W^L-M successive terms is interpreted. ^L-M^L-W 17.  The programme avoids the issue of whether the party survives after the ^L-M^L-M attainment of Communism.  But all the indications are that this is the present ^L-W^L-M intention; indeed it would seem that if the State is to &quot;wither away&quot; (paragraph 23), ^L-M^L-W the party will be all the more necessary. ^L-M^L-W No Embourgeoisement of Soviet Society ^L\\M^L-W 18.  Nowhere is there the slightest suggestion of a move towards greater -W-M^L-m tolerance of thought or opinion or greater scope for individual liberty. ^L-W^L-M 19.  The exaltation of public over private virtues, the stress on the communal ^L-W^L-M nature of the new affluence, and the explicit intention to eradicate all &quot; vestiges of ^L-M^L-U bourgeois opinions and outlooks &quot;, must undermine any belief that there is to be a ^L-M^L-W mellowing in the regime&apos;s outlook towards Soviet society. It is evident from the ^L-M^L-U programme that tendencies towards embourgeoisement are to be extirpated; this ^LV-XX^L-M I         may in itself be a sign of some concern among the Russian leaders.  The only ^L-W^L-W exception-typical of the Soviet Government&apos;s sensitivity towards the peasants at ^L-M^L-W the present time-is the acknowledgment of the necessity for private plots of land ^L-W^L-W to continue until the State and collective farms become efficient enough to render^L-M private farming superfluous. ^L-M^L-W 20.  On religion the theme of the 1919 Programme is repeated: religious ^L-W^L-U prejudices must be overcome without offending the feelings of believers. But the^L-M achievements of science are now enlisted since they &quot; leave no room for fantastic^L-W inventions of religion about supernatural forces&quot;. ^L-W^L-W The New Man^L^M H r         21.  In addition to stating the political, economic and social aims and policies^L-M \ of the party, the programme provides a detailed high-flown exposition and codex^L-M I       of Communist morality. Implicit throughout is the conviction that Communism ^L-W^L-W is altering the very nature of man.  Indeed the ambitious goals in the field of V-X-Wtm^M industrial and agricultural production would obviously be even more unattainable^L-W without this transformation.  Thanks to the &quot; change in the nature of labour &quot;^L-W and the development of social conscience throughout society, the old Adam willCONFIDENTIAL ^LM^tM ?                  273-60                                                                                             b 2
^kt 4 CONFIDENTIAL^gW die out, and everyone will develop &quot; an inner need to work voluntarily and ^gMmgWl according to his inclination for the common good &quot;. No explanation is given of mjgM^gM how Soviet man is to be metamorphosed in this way when at present, after 40 years ^gm\^gm of Socialism, he still, according to Soviet admissions, appears quite unregenerate ^gM^gW in his desire to secure his own material welfare at the expense of the community, ^gMWgW and sometimes even in breach of the law. ^gM^gM The Homogenising of the Soviet Union W I ^mWm^gM 22.  The programme repeats the standard thesis that with the approach of ^gm\mJM Communism the gaps between the town and the country, the intellectual and the mJM^gM manual worker, will progressively narrow. Simultaneously the boundaries between ^ggl^gM the component parts of the Soviet Union will lose their former significance and ^ggl^gM &quot; manifestations of nationalism &quot; will be eliminated.  At a later stage, regional ^ggl^gM differences (e.g., of language) will be eradicated-though this is admitted to be a ^ggl^gg. lengthy process-and local characteristics will be replaced by &quot; social homogeneity &quot; ^gm\^gM and &quot; an international culture common to all Soviet nations &quot;. What sort of culture ^ggl^gM this will be is made only too clear: it will be &quot; the culture of a classless society &quot;, ^ggtm\M having a &quot; high ideological content . . . imbued with optimism and with the mJM^gM life-asserting Communist ideas ... based on popular and party principles &quot;. All this ^gM^gm is to be done in the name of Lenin, and it represents a drive towards uniformity and ^gMWgW centralisation which Stalin (who is nowhere mentioned in the programme), with his I WWW^gM background as a Georgian and as a former Commissar of Nationalities, might not ^gM^gM always have tolerated. In this respect, if in no other, his successors are men of lesser ^gM^gM enlightenment. ^gm\^gm The Withering-away of the State ^gxM^gM 23.  The programme repeats the standard dogma that the Soviet State is ^gM^gM destined to wither away. The dictatorship of the proletariat has already ceased to ^gmW^gM be necessary to the USSR internally, and can give way to a &quot; State of the entire ^gM^gM people &quot;, but it is apparently necessary to persist with the existing form until: ^gM^WM (a) a &quot; developed Communist society &quot; has been built in the Soviet Union (a ^gM^gM stage not to be reached until some time after 1980); and ^gM^ggl (b) Communism has triumphed over capitalism in the international arena. ^gxW^WM Pending this obviously distant millenium, the general public are to participate ^gM^WM progressively in the process of government; the paid bureaucracy will contract, the ^gMWgM Soviets (local and regional councils) will be strengthened and the public WgW^WLW organisations (e.g., trade unions) will play a more important part. It is even stated ^gM^WLW that the most important Bills will be submitted to a national referendum. To ensure ^gM^WLW a constant flow of new blood through the organisations exercising authority, it is laid ^gMWjM down (with a proviso for exceptions) that one-third of the membership of each Soviet, Wjgm^WLW and one-half of the executive of each public organisation, should be replaced at every ^gMelection.  (A similar system of compulsory rotation is prescribed for the party ^ggl^gM organisation: see paragraph 15 above.) It appears, in fact, that part of the leisure ^WMgained through the reduction of working hours will be consumed by official and semi- ^gm\^ggl official duties: every man and woman in Russia will become an unpaid part-time ^ggl^gxM civil servant. This pre-supposes&quot; a Communist attitude to work among all members ^gM^ggl of society&quot;, i.e., a willingness to work for the State for nothing. ^gM^ggt Foreign Affairs ^ggl^g-M 24.  The programme assumes that the international situation will remain more I mmMm^gg  or less as it is at present, with the struggle between the two power blocs taking the ^gM^gMU form of a political, economic and ideological struggle which stops short of war. It ^Lwm^ggt is explicitly stated that any deterioration in international relations will necessitate an ^gM^gMu increase in expenditure on defence, which in turn might delay the realisation of the ^gMplans for a rise in the Soviet standard of living. Conversely an improvement in the ^gMWmjgt world situation, especially if it were accompanied by &quot; general and complete WmM^ggt disarmament &quot;, would make it possible to move ahead much faster. All in all, for   _   I ^gM^ggi what it is worth, the publication of this grandiose programme for economic  w ^gM^ggt development suggests that the Soviet leaders are in fact thinking, as well as wishing ^gMto give the appearance of thinking, in terms of at least two decades of peace. ^gM^ggi 25.  The section of the programme on foreign affairs follows closely the lines ^gM^WgM of the parallel passage in the Moscow statement of December 1960. In essence this ^gMconsists of an analysis of the present world situation, designed to show that capitalism mjgM^kM CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL                                      5 ^L\\^mwM is in decay and &quot; Socialism &quot; destined to triumph. The main object of Soviet foreign mwXM^mwM policy is defined as being the &quot; safeguarding of peaceful conditions for the building ^mwl^mWM of a Communist society in the USSR and the development of the world system of ^mWA^mmW Socialism&quot;. WxWM^mwi 26.  The programme exhibits no significant change on the subject of peaceful mmmW%wM- MM        co-existence.  It recites the standard axioms about (a) the present possibility of W\9M^mfW I v      averting world war, (b) the impending possibility of excluding world war from the MwXM^mJM life of society altogether, and (c) the continuing danger of aggressive wars so long as ^mwM^mJM imperialism exists. It does, however, also call attention at one point to the &quot; new ^mwM^mwM war being plotted by the imperialists &quot; and, at another, to the &quot; world thermo-nuclear ^mWl^mJM war &quot; being prepared by the imperialist camp.   The programme reiterates the ^mwM^mJM warning in the Moscow statement that if the imperialists do unleash war the peoples ^mwM^mwM will&quot; sweep away and bury capitalism&quot;. ^m3M^mwM 27.  The programme distinguishes between various types of war and repeats ^mwM^mwM the comment in Khrushchev&apos;s speech of January 6, 1961, which was not included ^mW\^mwM in the Moscow statement, that it is the duty of the Soviet Union to support &quot; just ^mwM^mwM i          liberation wars against imperialism&quot; (e.g., Algeria). ^m3M^mwrn The Under-developed Countries M-MWWmwM 28.  Although &quot; fraternal alliance&quot; with the newly independent countries MmwM^mwM is described as &quot; one of the cornerstones of the Communist Party&apos;s foreign policy &quot;, wAMM^mwM the tone of the programme in speaking of these countries is more paternal WaMM^mwM than fraternal. The &quot; young sovereign States &quot; have for the most part not yet broken ^m^M^mwM free of capitalism: until they put an end to their economic dependence on ^mwM^mwM imperialism they will continue to play the part of a &quot; world village &quot; and to suffer ^m^M^mwM semi-colonial exploitation. Moreover their independence will always be &quot; shaky 1^mwM and &quot; fictitious &quot; until they carry out sweeping social and economic reforms. In a WaMM^mwM grotesquely over-simplified passage the contrast is drawn between capitalism, &quot; the ^mwM^mwM road of national suffering &quot;, and &quot; Socialism &quot;, the &quot; path to freedom and happiness &quot;. WaMM^mwM The choice is open to the peoples concerned, but they are left in no doubt where their ^mWt^mwM 1           own interests lie. The whole message of this section is that the under-developed mWM^mwM countries need only set foot on the road of &quot; Socialism &quot; to be assured of the same ^mwM^mwM glittering future as is now promised to the present generation in the Soviet Union. ^mwM^mwM This is a thought which will undoubtedly exercise a powerful attraction in the ^mwM^mwM uncommitted world.^mwM 29.  The programme endorses two innovations of the Moscow statement: ^mwM^mwM (i) the transformation of the newly-liberated countries into &quot; States of national ^mwMmMxm democracy &quot; as a half-way house towards &quot; Socialism &quot;; and MwAM^mwM (ii) the statement that if &quot; revolution is not for export&quot;, the export of counter- ^m3M^mwM revolution cannot be tolerated either.^mwM The second of these doctrines is presumably intended to provide theoretical ^m3M^mwM justification for threats of Soviet military intervention, as in Cuba.H 30.  The programme attaches great importance to radical movements in the^mwM under-developed countries, and displays slightly greater doubt than did the MoscowmwAM declaration about the reliability, from the Communist point of view, of the national MwXm^mwM bourgeoisie in those countries. This bourgeoisie is said to &quot; display ever greater^mwM inclination towards compromise with imperialism and internal reaction &quot;. The^mwM Russians appear to have moved some way towards the Chinese position and this can^mwM be expected to influence their future relations with some of the uncommittedBloc Unity and Progress Towards Communism ^mWM^-Mm ? ,           31.  The programme follows the language of the Moscow statement in its^mwM &apos; VI   reference to the dangers of &quot;revisionism&quot; (i.e., Right-wing opportunism, as^mwM exemplified by Yugoslavia) and &quot; dogmatism and sectarianism &quot; (i.e., the Chinese,^mwM though they are not mentioned by name).^mwM 32.  An obvious dig at China (and Yugoslavia) is contained in the warning^mwM against&quot; the isolated building of Socialism detached from the world commonwealth^mwM of Socialist countries&quot;.CONFIDENTIAL273-60                                                                                        b ^LMM
6                                    CONFIDENTIAL ^LW33. There is stress on the need for unity and for the observance of conclusions I ^L\m\jointly arrived at. There is also a new and greater emphasis on the danger of ^L\\Wnationalism and chauvinism in conjunction with a warning that even under Socialism WWWthe class struggle may at times be revived and come to a head. This is presumably ^k-Wa retrospective glance at the lesson of the Hungarian revolution.34. A separate passage at the end of the programme explains that the different &lt;| I -WW\timing of the Socialist revolutions means that some countries will be ahead of others     &quot; Iin completing the building of Socialism and embarking on the building of^L-W               Communism. But the experience of the vanguard will be passed on to the laggards, ^L\W^L-W               who will thus be helped to catch up: so that they will all achieve &quot; a more or less WWWsimultaneous transition to Communism within the limits of one historic era &quot;. (The ^L\W^L-W               clear implication, however, is that the Soviet Union will be the first to reach the ^L-m^L-W               promised land.) This goal is to be achieved not by any spectacular new system of Ico-ordination, but simply by the development and improvement of &quot; the existingforms of economic relations among Socialist countries &quot;. Not surprisingly, no datesare announced.D.-Conclusions35. -(a) The programme reveals no important change in the Soviet outlook onWWW              the world, nor does it suggest that there will be any shift in Soviet foreign policy. jThe programme pre-supposes the avoidance of nuclear war, but the continuation of^L\W the political, economic and ideological struggle which passes under the name of ^L\W^L-W              &quot; peaceful co-existence &quot;. Moreover &quot; just liberation wars &quot; are to be supported.^L-W                    (b) The programme makes some allowance for Chinese views, but there is much ^L\W^L-M              in it, e.g., the statement about the possibility of peaceful revolution, which Peking will 1 ^L\W^L-W                    (c) The programme is aimed partly at the under-developed countries, who are WWW^L-W              expected to draw the moral that a rapid Tise in living standards can be achieved only ^L\Wby adopting a &quot; Socialist &quot; system of government. It seems likely that at least someof the less sophisticated Africans, Asians and Latin Americans will be dazzled by the 1vision of communal affluence which the programme offers.(d) There is no trace of the regime tolerating any mellowing and embourgeoise- WWW^--W              ment of Soviet society. The tone is as dogmatic and uncompromising as ever. ^f^Lm^L-W                    (e) It is plain that, although in theory the dictatorship of the proletariate may -WW]^L-W              outlive its usefulness, and the State may wither away, the party is expected to go ^L-W^L\W              from strength to strength. ^L-M^L\W (/) The economic goals set out in the programme are unrealistic. The ^L\\W^--W              industrial targets pre-suppose a constant rate of expansion as high as the present orBJI              slightly higher; while the agricultural targets would demand a rate of progress far H ?AVJ^--W              in excess of anything that has ever been achieved in the Soviet Union. BVI^L\W                    (g) Although the programme will encourage the Soviet public by giving them H WWW^L-W              something to work for, it is not likely to make them work harder, and indeed may ^L\W^L\W              only make them all the more impatient for easier conditions. ^L\W^L\W                    (h) In the long run the reduction of working hours, if it is achieved, will set the ^L\W^L\W              regime serious problems in the employment of leisure. ^k-W^L\W                    (&apos;*) The regional differences within the Soviet Union are likely to be progressively ^L\W^L-W              obliterated, and the &quot; independence &quot; of the constituent Republics to become even ^L\Wwww i ^m\\\\^L\W                    (/) The programme contains built-in excuses for possible failure. ^L\W^L\W Northern Department,^L\W Foreign Office,August 18,1961.

Before looking at these figures in more detail, it should be noted that the^kmm programme is based on calculations of outstripping the United States in economic^LWW            production. There are two distinct formulations of the claim that the USSR will ^mjM^kWW overtake the United States. The first and more grandiose is that by 1970 the Soviet ^mjM^LWW            Union will surpass the United States in production per head of the population. The^k-W            second claim is that by 1970 Soviet industrial production will surpass present ^L\m\wMMMM            industrial output in the United States. The first claim is larger than the second in WMMMtwo ways: wMMM^L*M                 (a) it specifies output per head (the Soviet population is at present 22 per cent. WMMM^kMm            greater than the American); and ^LMW^LWM                 (b) it apparently compares Soviet output in 1970 with American output in 1970. ^L^M^L*M                 3.  The second and more modest claim is a fairly straightforward extension of ^LXw^k-W            the industrial targets to be reached according to the Seven-year Plan (an 80 per cent. ^LMW^LMM |        rise between 1958 and 1965), and may well be fulfilled. That is to say, total Soviet ^LMW^tmm            industrial production in 1970 will probably exceed United States industrial ^LMM^k-W            production in 1961. But in the meanwhile American output will also increase, while WMMMwMMMM            the Soviet population will continue to be larger than the American. The origin of ^L\m\^LMM            the first, more ambitious, claim may possibly be a remark by Khrushchev on ^LMM^LMW       M. March 31, 1960, that &quot; in 20 years time we shall evidently have more than doubled ^LMW^LMM       q the present per capita production of the United States &quot;.  To achieve such an ^k\\\^LWM            objective it would be necessary to raise Soviet industrial output by about six times ^k\\\^k\\A            in 20 years, which is in fact the objective fixed by the new programme. ^L\\A^LWM                 4.  The programme provides insufficient information to permit any judgment ^k\\\^LWM            as to whether this claim can be fulfilled. Such facts as we are given suggest that it ^k\\\^LWM            is unlikely to be justified.  That is to say, it seems improbable that per capita ^L\\A^LM CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALindustrial output in the Soviet Union in 1970 will exceed per capita industrial ^L\W^L\\\\\               output in the United States in 1970.  Over the first decade, according to the ^L\W^L\\\\\               programme, the key indices of industrial output, agricultural output and national ^L\W^L\W\\               income are all expected to rise by about 9\ per cent, per year. Over the second decade ^L\\\^L\\\\\               this rate will still apply to industrial output, though other branches, especially ^L-Wagricultural output, will not grow quite so fast. Labour productivity in industry, ^L-Whowever, is assumed to grow unflaggingly throughout the period.                         m ^L\mm\_____ &gt;!f I5. The unreality of a programme which assumes (a) an equal rate of growth of^^^b               agriculture and industry, and (b) an undiminishing rate of growth of industry, isclearly demonstrated by Soviet experience. The rate of growth of industrial output WWWin the &apos;fifties was lower than in the &apos;thirties, which in turn was lower than in the ^L-W&apos;twenties. Yet the rate now forecast over each of the next 20 years is to be as high ^L-Was is likely to be achieved in the present year, perhaps even higher. As regards the 1 WWWrelative growth of industry and agriculture, according to Soviet statistics, agricultural ^L-Woutput increased by less than 2\ times between 1909-13 and 1960, whereas industrial ^L\W^L-WW               output increased between 1913 and 1960 by 45 times. Although the industrial index I WWWis undoubtedly exaggerated, the comparison clearly shows that industrial output has ^L-W^-WW               risen incomparably faster than agricultural. It is true that the current Seven-year ^L-W-WWW               Plan provided for a 70 per cent, rise in agricultural output as compared with an 1 ^L-W80 per cent, rise in industrial output, but the increases achieved so far are, ^L-Wrespectively, 1 . 4 per cent, and 20 per cent., which plainly indicates that agricultural ^L-W-WWW               output is not rising by a percentage even remotely comparable with industrial output. 1 \\WW6. As the programme is so obviously visionary in these fundamental respects, itbecomes difficult to take any part of it seriously. Although the emphasis inagriculture is placed on more intensive cultivation by modern means and everyprovision is made to avoid disturbing the traditional susceptibilities of the peasants, ^L\Win reality agricultural output cannot rise according to plan. This will affect the ^L-Mindustrial index since industry works in part on materials supplied by agriculture.Shortfalls in both indices will in turn entail failure to reach the target of nationalincome, and hence underfulfilment of all figures calculated with the national income ^L-W-WWW               as the numerator (real income per head, per worker and employee, per collective 1farmer, &amp;c). This is likely to upset all the provisions relating to living standards, ^k-Wwill react on the possibility of reducing hours, and eventually may place in jeopardysome of the cultural and educational provisions. j WWW7. The programme reflects, in fact, two objectives which are essential inpresent propaganda and to Khrushchev personally, namely that American outputcan be surpassed by some definite date and that agricultural output will 1 ^L\Wexpand successfully. A high and stable rate of growth of industrial output must be ^L\Wassumed in order to postulate overtaking the United States by any particular date, ^L-mfor if it is once admitted that the rate of growth might decline the date when this will -\WW^-WW              (or may) occur becomes indefinite. The success of agricultural policies must also be ^L\Wassumed, since otherwise American standards can never be reached.8. It is a useful corrective to Soviet exaggerations to compare them withAmerican estimates.   President Kennedy recently took up some of the Soviet ^^flarguments on growth rates.  In 1913, for example, the Russian gross nationalproduct (G.N.P.) was 46 per cent, of that of the United States. A generation later, ^L-Win 1959, the Soviet G.N.P. was no more than 47 per cent, of that of the United States. I ^L\WIf both countries maintain their present rates of economic growth, the President ^L\\Wexpects Soviet economic output to be no more than two-thirds of that of the UnitedStates by 1970. If the American rate of growth can be increased from 3  per cent.per annum at present to 4J per cent, in the future, the President does not expect the ^L-MSoviet Union to surpass the United States in its economic output at any time during ^L\Wthis century. It would seem therefore that, viewed in the light of the realities of ^L\\WWestern economic potential and in the face of the problems which are likely to arise WWWwithin the Soviet Union as a result of a combination of the stresses stemming from ^L-Wthe changing economic base, the need for greater emphasis in investment in servicesand the pulls of consumer consumption, it is unlikely that the present goal of   WWWsurpassing the United States will be realised within the next two decades. I ^L-W9. It should also be noted that the rate of Soviet economic growth has beendeclining during the past decade by about 3-4 per cent, per year.  If this decline ^L-WWWW\              continues, industrial output in 1980 will be four times what it is to-day, not six times Ias forecast in the programme. ^L-WCONFIDENTIAL \\\\W

It is clear, at least, that raising living standards is a prominent consideration ^gM^gM in the minds of the compilers of the programme and at first sight it appears curious ^gM^gM that a considerable part of the prospective benefits are to be taken in the form of ^gM^gM reducing working hours rather than in the increased abundance of goods which is ^gM^gM emphasised to be the sine qua non of a Communist society. By the end of the first ^gM^gM decade working hours will be reduced to 34-36 weekly, and a further unspecified ^gM^gM    I contraction in the working week is foreshadowed in the second decade, while at the ^gM^gM    I C    same time heavy physical work will disappear. Although some incidental economic ^gM^gM advantages can be foreseen as a result of shortening the working week, it would seem ^gM\WMm that this objective too is conceived primarily as something in which the USSR can tmm^gM overtake the West, quickly and at relatively small cost. ^gM^gM 11.  By the end of two decades, social services will comprise about half the total ^gM^gM volume of personal income and will include such things as free board and education ^gM^gM for children, free medical treatment, free accommodation, free use of communal ^gM^gM transport and certain communal services, partially free use of rest-homes and ^gM^gM tourist centres, free lunches in factories. This catalogue includes items which have ^gm\^gM already been achieved, wholly or in part, in advanced Western democracies or in ^gm\^gm\ the USSR itself, where rent and certain other services are already subsidised. Making ^gm\^gM them wholly free may have some propaganda significance, but the actual effect will ^gM^gM be slight unless substantial measures are taken simultaneously to expand the ^gM\jgM availability of services. By the end of the second decade, every family, including yWgM^gM newly-weds, is promised a nice clean flat. ^gM^gM 12.  As regards the finances and planning of the new order, it is noteworthy ^gM^gM that the programme mentions a need to achieve &quot; greater stability &quot; in plans. The ^gM^gM role of the budget will continue to be important. So will the role of money, prices, ^gM^gM credit, profit and all the gamut of monetary relations until such time as &quot; on the ^gM^gM transition to a single all-national Communist form of ownership &quot;, all these things ^gMw^gM will become out-of-date and will die out. The authors make no attempt to explain ^gM^gM how such a fantastic transition can take place in practice and we are confronted ^gM^gM simply with a spectacle of realism being swallowed up by myth.
