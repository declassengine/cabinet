(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 120COPY NO28th July. 1961CABINETB. O. A. C&apos;s INVESTMENT IN MIDDLE EASTAIRLINESMemorandum by the Lord President of the Counciland Minister for science the Economic Policy Committee considered on 26th July, 1961,a memorandum by the Minister of Aviation seeking authority for theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation (B. O. A. C,) to sell their minorityholding in Middle East Airlines (M, E. A.) and their interests in theMiddle East Aircraft Servicing Company (M.A.S. C. O.).2.      B. O. A. C&apos;s total financial commitment in these companies is 15. 3 millions, consisting of  8.1 millions in the form of investment and  7.2 millions in the form of guarantees.    Both companies have consistently lost money and are continuing to do so, and B. O. A. C. havofound that frequent demands are made on them for fresh capital.Lebanese interests in M.E.A. have now offered to buy B.O. A. C. outof both companies.    The offer is very poor and would involve themin a loss of at least  5. 6 millions.    At worst, since only  0.2 million of the offer would be paid in cash and the remainder would be securedeither by guarantees from a local Lebanese bank or by mortgages on aircraft, properties, etc., B. O. A. C. might lose as much as 15.1 millions of their total stake.3.      Nevertheless, the Economic Policy Committee agreed with theMinister of Aviation&apos;s conclusion that it would be right to approveB.O. A, C&apos;s request to settle on these lines because there is no prospect of obtaining a better settlement and there would certainly befurther heavy losses if the Corporation retained their financial interests in M. E.A. and M.A.S. C.O.4.      The Committee also agreed with the Minister&apos;s proposal toput in hand an independent enquiry into the general ability of B. O. A. C.to manage their external affairs.     The report of the enquiry wouldbe submitted confidentially to the Minister and he does not at presentenvisage either announcing the holding of the enquiry or publishingits result.    Nevertheless, the Committee felt that, since a settlement on these lines would be bound to become public knowledge sooner or later, the Minister should then be in a position to announce thathe had already put an enquiry in hand.-1-
5.     In view of the possibility that the terms of B. O. A. C&apos;s settle-ment might lead to public criticism of the Government, the committee felt that their conclusions should be submitted to the Cabinet forendorsement before action is taken on them.HAILS HAMOffice of the Lord president  ofthe Council, S. W. 1.27th July, 1961.-2-
