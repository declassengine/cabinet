C. (61) 131 Copy No.  5931st August, 1961CABINETCHINESE REPRESENTATION IN THE UNITED nations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsIntroductionMy colleagues will be aware that the substantive discussion of the question of chinese representation at the United Nations has been held over for the past10 or 12 years by a moratorium device, in which we have supported the americans. For convenience of reference a note on the history of this matter since1950, together with a statement of the attitudes hitherto taken by the United StatesGovernment, Her Majesty&apos;s Government, Commonwealh Governments and theChinese will be found in the Annex.2. The moratorium device has in recent years obtained less and less support and a forecast of this year&apos;s voting shows that at the forthcoming United nations assembly it will be almost certainly defeated. Rather than allow this to happen,the United States Administration, after consultation with their Formosan allies,have agreed to abandon the moratorium. They are now considering procedures which might be adopted this year to delay the admission of the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment. In this memorandum, after outlining the basic United Kingdomaims, I discuss the United States proposal in so far as it is known to us in detail,and submit to my colleagues a recommendation as to the attitude Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should adopt towards it.United Kingdom Aims3. Although certain advantages would flow from the People&apos;s Governmenttaking their place in the United Nations, we do not wish this to appear to be a major diplomatic defeat for the United States, and Western interests as a whole,nor do we wish if it can decently be avoided to fall out publicly with the Americansover China. Our object must be to improve the Western position at the united nations and in the eyes of the world as a whole by adopting a more realisticapproach to Chinese representation and, if possible, by putting Peking in the wrong. It follows that, whatever may be proposed to take the place of themoratorium, it must at least give the appearance of bringing closer a reasonable solution of the substantive problem and allow the many countries, who havehitherto felt gagged by the moratorium device, at least to air their views.4. At one time the Americans were contemplating a &quot; successor State&quot;resolution, declaring that there were now two States in succession to the originalChina. The Peking Government have declared on many occasions that they willnot sit in any international organisation in which the Nationalists are represented.But this is not necessarily a reason for not putting forward such a solution, sinceworld opinion would see it as reasonable, and it would be the Peking Governmentrather than the Western Powers who would be put in the wrong. Though something like this may provide the ultimate solution, it cannot be contemplated at presenthowever, since the United States Government have so far failed to persuade theChinese Nationalists to agree to any &quot; successor State &quot; resolution.SECRET59585 b^ THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTI.Printed for the Cabinet.

present American Proposal&apos;- - &apos;i5.   The State Department now propose:(a) To have the United Nations General Assembly declare by simple majoritythat the subject of Chinese representation is an &quot; important question &quot;,so that any resolution dealing with the subject itself would require a two-thirds majority.t.   ib) To muster a blocking one-third of the votes to exclude Peking this year. .(c) Subsequently to have the matter referred to a commission which would examine the problem in conjunction with the criteria for membership of the United Nations and the composition of the United NationsCouncils of which China is a member by specific provision of the charter.There are difficulties about such a move:(a) It may appear to be no more than a device to prolong the moratoriumindefinitely, in a slightly different way.(b) It is not certain whether the Americans would achieve the simple majorityrequired for the procedural decision that resolutions on the subject are&quot; important&quot;. Much would depend on the votes of the 22 nations which abstained last year on the moratorium resolution and of one ortwo new members. Most of the uncertain votes are those of african countries.6. Neither we, the Americans nor any of our friends, have been able to deviseany more acceptable solution. We are all agreed that the moratorium is no longerpractical politics. A &quot; successor State &quot; resolution, whether in the form of &quot; twoChinas &quot; or proposing &quot; one China one Formosa &quot;, would not be entirely easy for us, would not have United States support and even if successful, would not beaccepted by the Peking Government-or, probably, by Formosa. The only course open to us other than the American proposal would be a straight vote on theChinese seat, which would see us in the opposite camp to the Americans, and wouldprobably result in the 10 million inhabitants of Formosa being left with norepresentation in the United Nations and Western prestige being badly damaged.7. At its lowest rating, therefore, the course suggested by the Americans is less objectionable than other possibilities, and certainly they are justified in claiming that the problem of Chinese membership should be treated as an &quot; important question&quot;. There seems a reasonable chance that if the Americans lobbyenergetically as they are sure to they may achieve a majority on this aspect oftheir proposal.There are some other advantages:(a) The idea of a commission to examine the question originated recently withthe Swedish representative in New York. It may therefore appeal toother like-minded countries, particularly if the Americans put their casewell.   It will in any case be an advance on the moratorium.(b) It is impossible to predict the policy of a large number of members of theUnited Nations who have not previously taken sides on this issue, but our Mission in New York think it possible that a majority of them,recognising that there is in fact no clear-cut feeling one way or the otheras yet, would not be averse to putting off the decision for a further year.Moreover, there would not be the customary feeling of frustrationwhich has in the past resulted from the decision, under the moratoriumprocedure, that the substantive question should not even be debated.(c) There would be time for the United States Government to put the necessarypressure on the Chinese Nationalists to accept the idea that their jurisdiction was in fact limited to Formosa.(d) It is logical to link Chinese representation with the question of expanding the Councils, since the Russians have said that they will not consider this until the former question has been settled.8. So far as opinion in the United Kingdom is concerned, I suggest that, ifthe American proposal goes through, we could take the line that the United Nationshas to work by trying to find a proposal which commands the support of a
ANNEXCHINESE REPRESENTATION IN THE UNITED NATIONSNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsBackgroundOn 6th January, 1950, the United Kingdom recognised the Chinese PeopledGovernment as the Government of China and at the same time automaticallyceased to regard the Nationalist authorities as such. Since that date, the questionof which Chinese Government should represent the State of China has arisenmany times in the United Nations, its subsidiary organisations and other international bodies. We have never voted against a motion that the people&apos;sGovernment should hold the Chinese seat in the United Nations. Immediatelyafter our recognition we abstained and from September 1950, to May 1951, wevoted in favour. Since that date we have supported (hitherto invariably successful)motions proposed by the United States that discussion of a change in Chineserepresentation should be postponed, i.e., the so-called &quot; moratorium &quot;.The United States Attitude2. For many Americans anything to do with China is a highly emotionalsubject. There are various reasons for this, of which two of the most importantare(a) The casualties suffered by the Americans in the Korean War, which werefar greater than those of any other Western contingent.(b) The uncompromising hostility of the Chinese Peopled Government tothe United States.59585&quot; &quot;substantial majority of members. Although Her Majesty&apos;s Government believe,and have said publicly, that the Chinese seat should be held by the Chinese PeopledGovernment, this is a matter which can be decided only by the United Nations andthe only decision for which it seemed possible to mobilise adequate support wasto take the whole complex of problems in one mouthful, which inevitably meansreference to a commission.9. In discussing the matter with the United States Secretary of State,Mr. Rusk, in Paris at the beginning of August, I said that I should like to study theUnited States proposal further. Before taking the problem any further now 1should be glad to have a decision in principle by my colleagues whether we cansupport the United States plan.10. / recommend that, provided the further information given us by the state department is satisfactory, I should be authorised to tell Mr. Rusk that her majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to support the proposal which he put to mein Paris, on the understanding:(a) That the United States will make use of the breathing space which they hope to achieve, by exerting all possible pressure on the Nationalistregime to cease their pretentions to being the Government of China andadmit that they are no more than the Government of Formosa.(b) That the move to declare the question an &quot; important&quot; one should be linked explicitly to the proposal for a commission to examine theproblem, since otherwise the first move will appear to be no more thana device to prolong the moratorium under another guise.11. If this course is approved, I think, subject to the views of theCommonwealth Secretary, that we should take immediate steps to inform old commonwealth Governments of our decision and that we should be prepared to speak in similar terms to new Commonwealth Governments at a later date. ThePrime Minister said in the House on 27th July: &quot; We certainly expect to be inconsultation with Commonwealth and other friendly Governments before this issuenext comes before the United Nations &quot;.H.30th August, 1961.
Impelled by these considerations, the United States Government have gone tC-extreme lengths to keep representatives of Peking out of all possible international bodies. The China Lobby in the country at large and in Congress is energeticand can exert considerable pressure on the Administration by, for example,threatening to oppose the Governments foreign aid programme if they do not undertake to fall in with the Lobby&apos;s views on China policy. -3. Over the past year or 18 months there were some indications that american opinion on China was becoming more flexible, the power of the ChinaLobby seemed to be waning slightly and it was generally expected that, if theDemoorats won the 1961 Presidential Election, changes might take place in theAmerican official attitude towards Chinese representation in the United Nations(although it was not suggested that the United States could go so far as torecognise the Peking Government). In any case, voting on the moratorium atthe last Session of the General Assembly (44 in favour. 34 against and 22abstentions) had shown that it was unlikely to receive sufficient support at thefollowing session and that the Americans would have to adopt different tactics.Discussions in March of this year between Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in washington and Mr. Rusk showed that the latter&apos;s mind was turning towards some form of &quot;Two Chinas&quot; policy in the United Nations and this was confirmed bythe discussions which the Prime Minister and I had with President Kennedy,Mr. Rusk and Mr. Adlai Stevenson at the White House in April. It was thenapparent that the Americans had not thought in any detail about their tactics,but that their basic consideration was to ensure that the Nationalist Chineseretained a seat in the United Nations.4. In the course of discussion, Mr. Stevenson suggested that there might be some sort of &quot; successor State &quot; type of resolution, which would simply record thatthere were now two States in succession to the original &quot; China &quot;. It was pointedout that one of the reasons why many countries, including India, wanted to seeCommunist China in the United Nations was that, until this was done, it wasimpossible to tackle the question of expanding the membership of the councils of the Organisation, and it was suggested that it might be possible to link the two questions by means of a resolution in general terms seeking to deal with theproblem of divided nations and the expansion of membership of the Councils.5. At the end of the Washington meeting it was decided that our twoPermanent Missions in New York should study the question further, but despiterepeated promptings since then in both New York and Washington, the Americansseem only recently to have got down to detailed examination of the problem.After newspaper revelations that the Administration were considering a &quot; successorState &quot; resolution, there was an outcry from the China Lobby and at the end ofJuly Congress passed a Concurrent Resolution enjoining the Administration notonly to keep the Nationalist Chinese in the United Nations but to work activelyagainst the seating of the Chinese People&apos;s Government. This reduced still further the Administration^ limited room for manoeuvre. Since then the NationalistPrime Minister, Chen Cheng, in the course of a visit to the United States at theend of July has been given assurances of continued United States support. TheState Department have thus been forced to abandon the &quot; successor State &quot; ideaand now propose, first to try to arrange for the question of Chinese representationto be declared an important one and then to have it referred to a commission which would examine it together with the criteria for membership of the united nations and the composition of the Councils. The State Department have notyet worked out in detail their procedural tactics for such a move. They have however decided to abandon the moratorium device before it is voted down.The United Kingdom Attitude6. As indicated above, we have since 1951 supported the moratoriumprocedure. We have frequently explained in public that our reason for doing so was because we feared that discussion of the Chinese problem in the united nations might lead to the break up of the whole organisation. This argumenthas ceased to carry much weight and over the past year or so opinion in theUnited Kingdom has seemed to be moving in favour of a more clear-cut attitude.In Foreign Affairs debates speakers on both sides of the House have urged thatPeking should be seated in the United Nations. In the debate in the House ofCommons   on   12th   December,   1960,   Mr.   Godber,   then   Parliamentary
( fider-Secretary in the Foreign Office said, in effect, that while they were notparticularly keen on having Communist China in the United Nations, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment thought that, as a practical matter, the People&apos;s Government shouldbe seated there. At the same time he pointed out that in public statements theChinese had appeared to lay down conditions for their acceptance of a seat-thebanishment of the United States from the area of Formosa, the exclusion of the nationalists from the United Nations and the acknowledgment of China&apos;s rightto deal with Formosa as she saw fit and that we regarded such demands as unacceptable. Mr. Godber pointed out that the future of Formosa (apart fromthe question of its representation in the United Nations) raised difficult problems.There was no evidence that the 8 million indigenous Formosans, to say nothing of the 2 million mainland Chinese in the island, wished to fall into Communisthands.7. In a debate in the House of Lords on 8th February, I took the same general line, and added that it was for the United States to say, in their own time,what their attitude would be. In reply to questions in the recent Session ofParliament it has been explained that we are in constant touch with the Americanson this subject and that we shall naturally also take into account the views of commonwealth Governments.The Attitude of Commonwealth Governments8. At the meeting of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers in March this year there was a division of opinion about the idea of the People&apos;s Government taking their place in the United Nations. The Prime Ministers of Ceylon, Ghana and nigeria strongly favoured China&apos;s early admission, particularly in the context of disarmament. This is, increasingly, the view of the &quot; new&quot; Commonwealthmembers. The Australian Prime Minister, Mr. Menzies, and the New ZealandPrime Minister, Mr. Holyoake, however, expressed considerable reservations andthe latter recently announced that he saw no need for haste over the admissionof Communist China. Mr. Menzies has told the Prime Minister that.he wouldbe most reluctant to differ from the Americans on this question. The Canadianshave told us, at the official level, that their Government would probably agree to vote for a resolution declaring the Chinese problem an important question, butthat they were doubtful whether there would be much support in the united nations for the appointment of a commission to examine the problem. BothAustralia and New Zealand attach importance to safeguarding Formosa&apos;s positionof independence of Communist China.The Chinese Attitude9. The People&apos;s Government have frequently reproached us with what theycall our &quot; two-faced &quot; attitude over the question of Chinese representation andhave made it clear that an exchange of Ambassadors is dependent on Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment voting in favour of Peking&apos;s taking the Chinese seat. FollowingMr. Godber&apos;s speech on 12th December, 1960, and my own statement on 8th February that &quot; the facts of international life require that Communist China should be seated &quot;, the People&apos;s Government may well have believed that aturning point had been reached and that the United Kingdom would vote in their favour at the forthcoming Assembly. However, our references, in reply to parliamentary Questions, to the complexity of the problem and the need to achieve a settlement of the Formosan question also must have caused Peking to readbetween the lines and they may well now be prepared for us to hedge once more.This will hot prevent them from expressing their disappointment forciblv to her majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Peking. It is doubtful, however, whether their actions will go beyond this, although it is conceivable that they may turn downcommercial deals with this country which they may be considering, on the pretextthat trade and politics are inseparable.H.August 1961
