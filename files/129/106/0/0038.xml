C.(6l) 13820th September, 1961ECONOMIC PLANNINGMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeBefore we can form a clear picture as to the type of planning organisa-tion we should seek to establish, we must make up our minds what is to bethe purpose and extent of the planning and what methods are to be used.2.   The agreed object is no doubt to achieve a more rapid and consistentexpansion of national output without undue inflation or risk to the balanceof payments.    On this all parties concerned, Government, employers andtrade Unions, can agree.    But there are other motives as well.    To ^hetrade unions planning really means full employment for all their membersat their existing jobs and with steadily rising real wages.    For theemployers planning means freedom from changing Government policies of restraint and, in many cases, a secure market insulated from competition and divided on a neatly-arranged basis between the various firms.    neither of these concepts is consistent with the proper working of a free-enterpriseeconomy.3.   There are fundamental differences between the type of planning that can be successful in a socialist State, and what can be done in a free marketeconomy.    In a socialist State, because the volume of demand is controlled,including the wage bill, you can start by planning output on the basis ofsuch allocation of resources as the State thinks fit and then tailor demand to fit output.    But in a free economy public demand must be the starting-point.    This can be influenced but not planned.    The amount of moneypeople earn and the proportion of it they wish to spend and the type ofarticles they wish to buy are matters not within the control of any institution.Governments, employers and unions can influence the pattern and trend of demand and it is vitally important that they should do so to an increasingdegree.    But influencing is not the same thing as planning.    (All this is,of course, even more true of oversea demand, which is such a peculiarlyimportant factor in our economy.)4.   Our economic objective of growth without inflation can only beachieved if demand itself grows steadily at a pace sufficient to encourageoptimum investment and maximum output:  but not so fast as to causeinflation.5.   Planning in the normal sense of determining the investment of resources must therefore start from estimates of demand.    Responsibilityfor investment decisions must rest in the private sector with management and in the public sector with the statutory boards subject to the authorityof Ministers,    No central body can take over this responsibility and there-fore no central body can accept responsibility for a national &quot;plan&quot;.COPY NO.   y$CABINET(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
6.      What can be done is to try and ensure that the various estimates of demand upon which industries take their decisions are as closely co-ordinated as possible and that managements, when settling their programmes should have the clearest possible picture of the national economy.    If itappears from this general picture that investment plans in total are eitherexcessive or inadequate, then the Government can act to encourage ordiscourage investment.    This is a responsibility of Government whichclearly cannot be passed on to anyone else.    But to go further and attemptto dictate the distribution of investment between different industries is avery different matter, and something entirely contrary to the system of freecompetitive enterprise that has always been our policy.7.      There is already a good deal of planning in this sense in our economy.    The public sector, which is a large one, is planned methodicallyunder Government supervision.    In the private sector, a good deal of work is already done in consultation between industry and the Government onestimating future trends of demand.    This is already done, for example, in*;he chemical and motor industries and no doubt could be extended.    But here are definite limitations on what can be done.    It is much easier toget from a group of manufacturers their combined view of the growth of thetotal market for their product than it is to get the investment plans of individual manufacturers, which they jealously guard from their competitors.If competition is to work, the total plans of the competing firms should addup to more than the probable demand for their products:  otherwise there isno room for competition.    In many industries future estimates of demand will be highly difficult to obtain.    At the moment, for examplenothing could poseibly be prised out of the cotton industry.    The engineering industry is so diffuse and diverse that it would be a great problem to getany comprehensive picture.    This is even more true of many of theconsumer goods industries and in the case of the service trades   which take up such a large part of our total output, the task seems quite impossible.8.      We can therefore hope to assemble, by using the existing machineryof Government Departments, a fairly comprehensive picture of the demandestimates and investment plans of the public sector and of the future demandestimates of some parts of the private sector (and from that make someguess as to their investment plans).    It would no doubt be valuable to extend this process as far as possible.    The information then obtained could becorrelated at a central point.    Logically, this should be within the Goyern-ment machine, though in practice it would be very difficult to find thenecessary staff, and this might well be done by a new staff.9.     Having assembled all this information, the first task would thenpresumably be to draw deductions upon which action could be based.    we might find that there was inadequate correlation between the investment plans of some of the major industries and the capacity of the plantmanufacturers, though I fancy there is a good deal more contact alreadybetween the plant manufacturers and their customers than we may give them credit for.    If we found that some industries were working on a wholly different estimate of the expansion of the economy than wereothers, perhaps some co-ordination could be effected.    Here again I doubt whether such great discrepancies do exist.    But the deductions wewould draw would be of value for our main purpose of increasing and
stabilising the rate of economic growth if it were possible on the basis ofthem to stimulate parts of the economy that would otherwise be lagging, to identify and eradicate possible bottle-necks and to ensure that money incomesdid not rise faster than probable output.    This would mean getting many people to vary their plans for investment, some to make them greater andsome to make them smaller.    It would also mean influencing the policies of the unions on wages, the employers on dividends and prices and theGovernment on taxation.10.    Do we really wish to have an independent body to undertake these functions?    Would an independent body, for example, have any effect on thetrade unions ?    It seems to me that the experiment of the Three Wise Menshows that this would not be so.    If an independent body agrees with theGovernment, no one is particularly impressed:  if it disagrees with theGovernment, it merely causes us embarrassment.    How can an independent body influence industries to expand or contract their investment plans evenif those plans are known in detail?    This can only be done in a corporatesystem where there is an agreed policy of market-sharing and where thedistribution of investment between the various individual firms is done on abasis of cartellisation.    Finally, I do not imagine that we would wish anindependent body to exercise control or even influence the fiscal policies of the Government   (though this, I suspect, is precisely what the Federationof British Industries would like to see happen).11,     I conclude that in a free-enterprise system there is no real room for central planning in the proper sense of the word.    Responsibility for planning and performance must rest with managements, labour and Govern-ment.    But there is room for much better information and much moreconsultation, so that the parties who have to take decisions must do soin the full knowledge of their own interest and of the national interest.    a body of this kind would be essentially consultative.    It would need to be served with adequate staff to provide it with all the information it needs and a proper analysis of that information.    But to create a separate officeof development with independence and authority capable of giving publicexpression to its own views on policy, as distinct from publication offactual studies would, to my mind, be a grave mistake.    We would either be creating a body that had power without responsibility, and which there-fore could only cause trouble without guaranteeing results, or we should be driven, step by step, into the Trades Union Congress (T.U. C. ) concept of a central planning body capable ot imposing its will on private industry.Such a concept seems to be consistent neither with Government policy norwith the economic interests of our society.12.    I of course accept that, following the meetings held by the Chancellorof the Exchequer with the T. U, C. and the employers&apos; organisations, theGovernment are expected to take an initiative in the field of &quot;planning&quot; andthat this must not seem to be too much of a damp squib.    I should, there-fore, be entirely happy to see the creation of an organisation independent of the normal Government machinery, headed by a man of high quality andstaffed by seconded civil servants, industrialists and trade unionists, onthe following understandings:-(i)   It should be responsible to the National Economic Counciland have no independent existence of its own.
(ii)    It should not publish anything without prior Governmentapproval.    Policy decisions based upon its studies shouldbe published by the Government.(iii)    In its consideration of the problems of particular industries,it should work through existing Government and quasi-Governmental channels, e.g. , the Board of Trade for theprivate sector generally, the Departments responsible for nationalised industries, the Iron and Steel Board, etc.(iv) When its creation is announced, the limitations on its scopearising from the basic economic organisation of thecountry, which we do not wish to change, should be made clear, and the public should not be led to believe that the mere establishment of new machinery will of itself bringabout an automatic increase in the pace of economic growth.r. m.Board of Trade, S.
