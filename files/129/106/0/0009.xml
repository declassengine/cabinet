CONFIDENTIAL3A SUMMARY OF THE O.E.E.C. EXPERTS&apos; REPORT ONRISING PRICESI. -IntroductionThe report was made by independent experts, namely Professor Fellner(United States), Mr. Milton Gilbert (O.E.E.C Director of Economics andStatistics), Professor B. Hansen (Sweden), Professor R. F. Kahn (United Kingdom),Professor F. Lutz (Switzerland) and Professor P. de Wolff (Netherlands). It dealswith Western Europe, the United States and Canada. It concentrates on theperiod 1952 to the third quarter of 1960 since the special circumstances of theearlier period of post-war reconstruction and the Korean boom are less relevantto current policy considerations.2. Price stability is both feasible and desirable. If it is not achieved, thesuccess of the &quot; two more fundamental objectives &quot;, high employment and adequategrowth, will be prejudiced, and so will balance of payments stability. Stableprices do not mean complete rigidity in an index of average prices-in a growingeconomy this would be unattainable. The aim must be to avoid inflationarypressures. These may be detected not only in prices but in the credit situation,in the length of order books, in stocks, commodity markets and existing prices.3. There is no easy answer to the problem of rising prices, and it will notsolve itself. It is wrong to cure inflation by sacrificing growth or high employment.What is necessary is, first, a political decision to give a high priority to pricestability and, secondly, a broad basis of public understanding and support.II. -The Behaviour of Prices, 1953-604. The selection of 1953 as a base year does not imply that prices were notdistorted in that year. There were a number of Government controls in mostquarters, especially on rents, and some readjustment of these prices was to follow.Moreover, the price levels in different countries were probably out of line.Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia had relatively low prices, while inBelgium, Switzerland and the United States prices were relatively high. For thisreason alone, one would expect that some change in relative price levels was totake place.5. The rates of increase in consumer prices over the period variedconsiderably from country to country. The developed countries, apart fromFrance, all had price increases of less than 25 per cent. Within this group theNetherlands, United Kingdom and the Scandinavian countries had a more thanaverage degree of inflation; Austria, Germany, Eire and Italy were about average;and in Switzerland, Belgium and the United States prices rose relatively slowly.In some countries, including the United Kingdom, prices were rising for most ofthe period; in others inflation was a more intermittent process. For most countriesand for the period as a whole, rents increased more than other prices. The risein food prices was generally about the average for all consumer prices. The pricesthat rose least in most countries were those of clothing and durable goods. Theprices of services tended to rise more rapidly than those of goods. There seem tobe two main reasons for this. First, there are some service trades in which labourproductivity rises very slowly. Secondly, at the beginning of the period, manyservice wages were relatively low, and conditions of full employment helped themto catch up wages elsewhere. In most consumer price indices, services did nothave a great weight. In North America and Switzerland, however, their weightwas considerable, and this factor can be expected to become more important inalmost all countries in future.6. The consumer price index in European countries usually understates theamount of domestic inflation, for construction prices and the prices of goods andservices consumed by the public sector have risen more rapidly than privateconsumer prices. On the other hand it must be remembered that the normalconsumer price indices show the change over time in the cost of buying an unalteredcollection of goods and services. It is clear that consumption patterns have shiftedslightly in favour of those goods and services whose prices have risen least, and inthis sense the consumer price index slightly overstates the rise in the cost of living.CONFIDENTIAL
4CONFIDENTIALIII.-Special Price Increases7. In many countries, too much attention is now being paid to very smallchanges in price indices. There are conceptual difficulties about price indices whichgenerally make such small changes meaningless. Moreover, an index may risefor reasons that have nothing to do with inflationary pressure, i.e., for reasons otherthan excess demand, excessive wage increases and monopolistic pricing. Thesespecial factors include:(i) The adjustment of controlled prices, e.g., rent de-control and the removalof subsidies.(ii) An increase in indirect taxes or customs duties.(iii) Accidents-poor harvests, Suez-type crises.(iv) Changes in export or import prices due to external influences.Effects of this kind cannot be quantified, and only the direct and immediate resultscan be easily studied. It is clear that rent de-control or the adjustment of controlledrents have been of considerable importance in all countries. Changes in importprices, although they cancelled out over the period, also tended on balance to raiseprices, since increases in import prices produced some increases in wages and pricesthat were not reversed when import prices fell. Other factors were of particularimportance in particular countries : the de-control of food prices in 1954 helped toend a period of price stability in the United Kingdom.8. These special factors should be prevented from having a cumulative effecton other prices and on wages. It would be desirable to have additional price indicesfrom which such special effects were excluded.IV/-The Role of Demand9. Government policy should treat excess demand as a problem separate fromthat of wage-push, although the two do interact. Demand is excessive when thevolume of aggregate monetary demand cannot be met at existing prices without anundue straining of resources. The unemployment rate at which demand becomesexcessive will vary from country to country and will also vary at different times ina given country because-differences in employment statistics apart-there may ormay not be a strain on industrial capacity before there is a strain on the laboursupply; mobility may vary, scarcities may be more or less sectional, andexpectations of future price changes may have a decisive influence.10. Nevertheless, it is not difficult to define, roughly, the periods in whichdemand in each country was excessive.Approximate Periods of Excess DemandCountryBelgiumCanadaFranceGermanyItaly ......Netherlands ...NorwaySwedenSwitzerland   ...United KingdomUnited States ...ApproximateLength of Time1 year1 year2 years2 yearsNot significant2\ years2\ years2\ yearsl\ yearsIt-2 years1^-2 yearsApproximate DatesEarly 1956-early 1957Early 1956-early 1957Early 1956-2nd quarter 19581955 and 1956Late 1954-beginning 1957Early 1954-end 1956Early 1955-mid 1957End 1955-mid 1957Late 1954-mid 1956Late 1955-early 195711. This view on the timing and duration of periods of excess demand isroughly in line with the views of the stabilisation authorities in each country. Theintensity of these bursts of excess demand varied, but it is probably the durationrather than the intensity of excess demand which matters. Most countries hadexcess demand at some time between 1955 and 1957. The typical situation wasthat of an investment boom superimposed on a high level of consumer demandCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5and construction activity. This was accompanied by a boom in inter-Europeantrade. Those countries whose exports benefited most from this trade boom(Norway, Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands) and which were, therefore,untroubled by balance of payments difficulties, were able to tolerate excess demandfor longer than those whose balance of payments suffered.12. Balance of payments troubles forced Governments to curb demand by;al and/or monetary methods.  They did this quite quickly and successfully,which suggests that there is nothing wrong with the available weapons-only withthe will to use them. However, decisions on timing are genuinely difficult, evenin retrospect. There are gaps and delays in the necessary information. Here thereare two main deficiencies: first, in the statistical series on capacity utilisation, thelabour market, the flow of orders, stocks, profit margins, current and plannedcapital spending; second, in analytical studies of changes in prices, productivity andlabour earnings.13. What is needed for policy in general is, first, promptitude and vigour.Previously too little has been done too late. Second, more use of fiscal measures.This does not imply less use of monetary measures, but simply that too much haspreviously been hoped for from monetary measures. Lack of flexibility is notinherent in fiscal measures. The best idea is that the Government should have thepower to vary specified tax rates over specified ranges without prior approval fromParliament. Annual budgets are too infrequent to make effective regulators, andthe eighteen-month to two-year forecasting that they require is difficult. Interimmeasures are unpopular because they suggest that the last budget was wrong andbecause a politically explosive debate on tax changes involves a lot of fuss andbother in order to secure relatively small alterations. It is therefore very useful forthe Government to be able to vary taxes within limits set by Parliament. Also,measures that have particular effects on particular sectors may be extremelyvaluable, and should be used more.14. Monetary policy should be complementary to fiscal measures. It shouldinvolve a minimum of specific controls on normal credit and security markets.One such control, however, is very useful, and that is the control of consumercredit. If used over a long period it tends to break down and to distort thebehaviour of credit institutions, but it is a useful emergency power. House-building seems to have got out of hand in the European boom, and more vigorouscurbs would be useful. Professors Kahn and de Wolff are inclined to favour directcontrols in this field.15. Certain longer-term policies to deal with structural rigidities are desirable.In various countries attempts to improve labour mobility and plant location, andto iron out seasonal fluctuations, e.g., in building activity, have had good results.It is especially important that a high level of demand in one sector does not produceprice increases throughout the economy. This leads on to the next main topic.V-The Role of Wages16. When wage rates are fixed by collective bargaining or by Governmentregulation it is possible for forces other than supply and demand to operate in thelabour market and to influence costs and prices. Except for the few countrieswhere excess demand has been violent and prolonged (Turkey, Spain and Iceland),it is wage-push rather than excess demand that is the decisive factor in explainingthe differing amounts of inflation in the various developed countries.17. There have been occasions when collective bargaining has moderated therise in wage rates, but in general it has accelerated it. In Italy, Switzerland andGermany the resulting rise in wages has been on the whole no faster than the rateof growth of productivity. In other countries, and particularly in the United States,United Kingdom and Denmark, wage increases have been greater than the rise inproductivity.18. Wage-push is an independent inflationary force, not a manifestation of^excess demand. &quot; We consider the following points decisive in showing that wagenegotiations were a dominant factor in the upward movement of wages.(i) Wages increased at a substantial rate during most of the period, includingperiods when there was no real shortage of labour in the sense ofdifficulty for most industries to obtain additional labour at existingwage rates.CONFIDENTIAL
6CONFIDENTIAL(ii) Wages increased in many highly paid industries at times when there wassubstantial unemployment in the industry. In some cases, theseindustries were the leaders in setting the pace for the wage round thatspread generally to most industries.(iii) In some countries, substantial unemployment was prevalent throughoutthe period and there was never any real strain on the labour marketfrom demand.(iv) Even in industries where labour was at times tight, the size of the wageincrease was often out of proportion with what management would havebeen prepared to pay freely to obtain additional workers(v) It is significant that the movement of wages was continuously upward;in times of slacker demand and rising unemployment they showed notendency to decline. This cannot be explained merely by stickiness ofwages, unless stickiness is defined as control of the market over therelevant range of variations of demand for labour.&quot;There should therefore be policies for dealing with wage-push as well as withexcess demand.19. Several features of the wage bargaining process may be noted:(i) First there is the price-wage spiral. An increase in the cost of living leadsto successful wage claims which in turn lead to an increase in unitlabour costs and therefore a further increase in prices. There are lagsin this process, and the growth of productivity during the price-wageprice cycle will damp down the final effect. In practice this chain ofevents has only been important at certain times. The tying of wagerates to a price index would seem to increase the dangers of a price-wagespiral, but in fact seems to have had effects no worse than thoseachieved unaided by a strong trade union movement determined tokeep wages in line with the cost of living. Again, the influence ofspecial factors in the price index should if possible be ruled out. Thus,it is paradoxical that a disinflationary increase in indirect taxes shouldbe used as a basis for wage claims. Where arrangements for indexingwages to prices have to be used, it is preferable to have the sort ofarrangement in which the index must rise by some definite amountbefore wages can be reconsidered.(ii) Secondly, there is a tendency for a key bargain in a particular industryto influence wage-settlements in other parts of the economy.Competition, and oversea competition in particular, will tend to dampdown this process. The tendency to spread wage increases throughthe economy is connected with the leap-frogging process, and there issome evidence that leap-frogging has been more important in theslower-growing economies. Where the general level of real wages hasnot been rising rapidly, groups of workers have fought particularly hardto maintain their established position in the wage hierarchy.(iii) Thirdly, there are a number of factors that seem to affect the initialkey bargain. In the United States and United Kingdom, the sheerhabit of demanding large money-wage increases seems to have persisted,in spite of the fact that real gains were usually short-lived. The attitudeof particular employers, union leaders and arbitration courts, and thepolitical pressures affecting the Government&apos;s resistance to claims byworkers in the public sector-all these have been important.20. A wages policy is needed to deal with wage-push, just as fiscal andmonetary policy are needed to regulate demand. The majority of the group ofexperts feel that a decision to adopt such a policy must be made at the highestpolitical level, and that there must be wide public understanding and supportfor its aims. Such a policy runs counter to the traditional idea of wage-bargainingwithout Government intervention, but this idea is no longer realistic. |Governments are now responsible for high employment and for fosteringconditions in which the economy will grow at an adequate rate. Inflation, ofwhich wage-push is an important cause, threatens these objectives. Governmentscannot ignore inflation except by risking failure in those aims to which they arealready committed.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL721. The firm control of demand is not enough. Experience suggests thatprices are likely to go on rising even when unemployment is significant and growthis being held back. Moreover, if price stability is achieved in this way, it will reston a shaky political basis.22. It is sometimes suggested that an alternative would be to reduce thebargaining power of labour. But it would be technically impossible to restorecompetition to the labour market; the consequences of any attempt would beextremely uncertain, and the tendency would be to re-create the very imbalanceof power which first brought the unions into being. In some countries, changesin labour legislation are needed to make industrial relations more rational andorderly, but these changes would not materially affect the degree of competitionin the labour market.23. It follows that a wages policy is necessary. This view has already gainedground in countries that have had to face wage-push. Moreover, Governmentsare already deeply involved in wage settlements, as employers in the public sectorand as arbitrators elsewhere.24. The first requirement is that the Government should estimate the rateof growth of the general level of money wages that will be consistent with thelong-run growth of productivity and therefore with price stability. Allowancemust be made for the fact that increasing productivity itself tends to raise thegeneral wage level as people shift to higher paid jobs. Once a rate of increaseis decided, there must be no more exceptions above than below it if it is to work.25. Secondly, the Government must communicate this normal rate ofgrowth to the interested parties. Finally, they must try to mobilise public supportfor this policy.26. There are several courses of action that do not constitute a wage policy.One is vague exhortation to labour to exercise restraint. A second is the informalagreement with unions to maintain a wage freeze. A third is the use ofarbitrators, if they are not given a guiding light by which to work. Another isGovernment intervention at a late stage of a dispute in order to achieve acompromise. Nor is centralised wage negotiating per se to be confused with awages policy.27. A wages \policy would have to evolve in each country in a way that fittedin with existing traditions and economic structure. In general, the announcementof a normal rate of increase for wages would help to form public opinion in- a waythat the bargainers would find hard to ignore. This would take advantage of thecurrent growth of public concern over this problem and of the increasing senseof responsibility shown by both sides of industry. The burden of proof wouldthen tend to be on the group which wanted to negotiate a wage increase thatdiffered from the norm. There should be a centre of authority in the Governmentcharged with announcing the norm, and there should be machinery forGovernment consultation with the interested parties. It would perhaps be useful ifthe Government were represented at negotiations, not as a mediator but in order topresent the case for the national interest. There is no obvious reason why theGovernment should neglect the national interest in this sphere. This would meanGovernment participation from the start.28. It is also incumbent on the Government to have a wages policy in thepublic sector. Governments are too inclined to settle public sector wages by largechanges at infrequent intervals. When it is clear that, say, teachers or bus drivershave become considerably underpaid, a large pay settlement is made to restoretheir position and this sets a bad example for negotiations throughout the economy.Smaller and more frequent increases would be preferable.29. The Netherlands is the only country to have adopted a wages policy.Although Dutch prices have risen by about as much as those in the UnitedKingdom since 1952 it is to be noted that, as a small country heavily involved ininternational trade, the Netherlands has not been able to swim against the tideof external events, and, with a balance of payments surplus, has had little incentiveto do so. Moreover, Dutch prices were relatively low at the beginning of theperiod. A wages policy has, in fact, enabled the Dutch to maintain growth,employment and a strong balance of payments through an unusually long periodof excess demand. The French have, since 1958, adopted a firm policy on publicCONFIDENTIAL
8CONFIDENTIALsector wages and on the Government-regulated minimum wages, and this has beensuccessful. Thus the experience of these countries reinforces the argument for aGovernment wages policy. (Professors Fellner and Lutz do not agree with themajority view on wages policy-though accepting the underlying diagnosis of thewage-push. They accept that some sort of wages policy is desirable, but they doubtwhether the policy suggested by the majority will have any significant success, andthey believe that the failure of this sort of policy would lead a Government into evermore detailed control of particular wages and prices. This they believe to be )undesirable. They suggest, first, that the level of unemployment at which wage-pushinflation disappears may be lower than the majority thinks, and may be at a levelthat is politically acceptable. If this proved not to be so, they would argue that theonly answer must be a reduction in the size and functions of bargaining units on bothsides of industry.)30. It is clear that success in dealing with wage-push will make a higher level ofdemand tolerable, since the level at which demand becomes excessive is not uniquelyfixed. This means that a higher average employment level and a higher rate ofgrowth can be achieved. The benefits to all members of the community of this sortof improvement will far outweigh the occasional, small and temporary gains madeby one group of workers at the expense of others or by labour as a whole at theexpense of capital.VI. -The Role of Monopolistic Pricing31. A producer with some market power may be able, at least in the shortrun, to raise his profit margin by raising his prices. Even if he does this only whendemand or costs are also rising, it will still be an independent inflationary force. Itis very hard to assess the importance of this factor, since the necessary data arelacking. In European countries there is little evidence that market power is usedin this way, but it is undoubtedly of some importance in the United States. Marketpower may contribute to inflationary problems in so far as it reduces the likelihoodof price reductions in the short run. Governments should encourage competition,including foreign competition, and this point should be borne in mind whenconsidering the problems of domestic agriculture.VII. -The Balance of Payments32. Price stability in all countries would probably mean a much greaterstability in the balance of international payments, except for cyclical and seasonalfactors. When structural changes occurred in the pattern of demand and productionthere would be room for individual prices to alter accordingly, though occasionalchanges in exchange rates might be necessary. In general, there can be no doubtthat price stability would help to stabilise the balance of payments, since inflationtends in practice to proceed at varying rates in different countries.VIII. -Concluding Note33. The emphasis on price stability does not imply that any less attentionshould be paid to problems of economic growth. Stable prices will facilitate steadygrowth, but a rapid growth of productivity also makes stable prices easier to attain.CONFIDENTIAL
