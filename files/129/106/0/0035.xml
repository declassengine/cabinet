C. (61) 135 Copy No.   5 815th September, 1961CABINETGOVERNMENT INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYEES: THE M RATENote by the Acting Secretary of the CabinetThe attached minute to the Prime Minister from the Chancellor of theExchequer is circulated so that the Cabinet can consider this question at their next meeting.(Signed)     F. A. BISHOP.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,14th September, 1961.59678IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1961
Prime MinisterGovernment Industrial Employees: the M RateI explained to the Cabinet on 5th September a problem that had arisen overa group of Government industrial employees. Under a written agreement signed by the Official and Trade Union sides in 1959, the pay of these employees (knownas the M rate) is reviewed in April and October each year. On each occasion the basic rates negotiated in 34 specified industries are arithmetically averaged: theresult determines for the next six months the M rate governing the pay of about100,000 industrial Civil Servants. The agreement runs for five years to 1964 with no break clause. The next review is due in October and the movement of rates inthe specified industries suggests that an increase of about 3s. a week, costing   million a year, will be payable.2. The Wages Committee considered again to-day whether the &quot; pause &quot; in wages should apply to these people. My own view, and that of some of mycolleagues, is that the Government must not break a formal written agreement ina way which might render a private employer in the same position liable to an action in the Courts. In my statement of 25th July, and again in a letter sent on my behalf to representatives of the industrial Civil Servants, I said thatcommitments already entered into would be met. In my view the agreement aboutthe M rate is one of these commitments. If we were to repudiate the agreement,we would seriously damage our standing in the eyes of the public and there wouldbe little chance of persuading the unions again to undertake long-termcommitments of this kind.3. Other Ministers argued that the Government were already in breach ofimportant agreements (such as the Fair Wages Resolution) and to concede anincrease in the M rate would be seen by private employers and by opiniongenerally both at home and abroad as a sign of weakness, and would make the&quot; pause &quot; ineffective. They also believe that it would make it impossible for theGovernment to resist claims from other groups of Civil Servants whose wages,though not regulated by a written agreement, have hitherto invariably followedwage movements in the private sector.4. In view of this difference of opinion, I undertook to submit the question to you for a decision.SELWYN LLOYD.8th September, 1961.
