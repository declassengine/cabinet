(61) 11525th Tuly,. 1961TOP SECRET CopyCABINETBERLIN:  STRENGTHENING OF UNITEDKINGDOM FORCES IN GERMANYMemorandum by the Minister of DefenceThe development of the Berlin crisis makes it necessary toconsider what steps would have to be taken, and their time-scales if wehave to strengthen our forces in Germany.   I annex a table of measureswhich could be taken to strengthen the British Army of the Rhine (B. A. O. R. )and the Royal Air Force (R. A. F.), Germany.2. There is no serious problem with the R. A. F.   To bringB. A. O. R. on to a full war footing some 62, 000 officers and men areneeded, 32, 000 to bring present units up to strength, 30, 000 in freshunits almost entirely administrative.3. The only way to meet this in full would be by Proclamation.Present plans only envisage this in the context of general mobilisation,when post-proclamation reservists would be called up at the same timeas pre-proclamation men.   To make plans to avoid this would take manyweeks.4. The use of pre-proclamation reservists would produce lessthan 17, 000 men and these would not all match what was needed in ranksand trades. Their use would also invalidate plans for the mobilisationof the strategic reserve, and destroy the basis on which the ArmyEmergency Reserve is being built up.5. One way of reinforcing B. A. O. R. immediately would be tosend to Germany one Surface-to-Air Guided Weapons Regiment (S. A. G. W, )and two Light Anti-Aircraft (L. A. A./) Regiments without compensatingreductions. This would, however, not place B. A. O. R. on anything likea war footing.6. Measures to bring the Army and the R, A. F. up to strengthin Germany should not, however, be taken in isolation.   We should needto consider also the disposition of our naval and other forces, and, mostimportant, the strengthening of Bomber Command; the Chiefs of Staffare now examining this.    We should also need to consider what civilmeasures should be taken either under the Alert System of the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organisation (N. A. T. O. ) or under our own PrecautionaryStages.7. All this reinforces the view that any military plans to dealwith a Berlin crisis must be considered in the context of meeting ageneral war in N. A. T. O. and I invite my colleagues to take note of thisposition.H. W.Ministry of Defence, S. W. 1.25th July, 1961TOP SECRET
TOP SECRETANNEXMEASURES OF REINFORCEMENTGeneralBoth the Army and the R. A. F. would take the following measureto reinforce Germany should the need arise:-(a) Recall of all personnel of B. A. O. R# and R. A. F. Germanyfrom leave and courses by the issue of special instructions.(b) Closure of Army and R. A. F. units in Germany not requiredfor war, formation of war units and re-distribution of personnel withinthe Command.B.A, O.R.2. The War Office have examined methods by which B.A. O. R.might be reinforced:-Without Reservists3.Method 1 -By implementing the proposalto send to B. A. O. R. one S. A. G. W,and two L. A. A. Regiments andcertain minor units;  this wouldadd 2, 000 to the strength ofB. A. O. R. now and materiallyincrease operational efficiency.Three weeksWith Reservists4.Method 2Using Pre-Proclamation ReservistsPre-Proclamation R.eservists nowconsist of 13^ 700 individuals inRegular Reserve Section A and4, 500 volunteers in Units in the ArmyEmergency Reserve (A. E. R. ) I. SectionA could be used to bring units inB. A. O. R. nearer to war establishmentbut there is a serious shortage in theadministrative corps.   To divert themto B. A. O. R# would seriously handicapmobilisation for limited war. Nothingwould be gained in B. A. O. R. byemploying men of A. E. R. I, eitheras units or individuals, since theunits are at very low strength andare attempting to build up. TheWar Office therefore do not recommendthe use of this method. Two months1-TOP SECRET
TOP SECRETMethod 3  -   Proclamation.   The Reservistsavailable on proclamation wouldamply cover our requirement tobring existing units in B. A. O. R.up to war establishment (30, 661OR&apos;s and some 1, 300 officers)plus first reinforcements. Toprovide the administrative unitsneeded to balance the order ofbattle would also involve theembodiment of part of theTerritorial Army and the callingup of A. E. R. IIIf it were decided to issue aProclamation for the sple pur-pose of bringing B. A, O. R. to warstrength with individual reservistsand supporting units, and not as anintegral part of mobilisation, a newadministrative plan would have tobe made and would need many weeks&apos;warning.   If it is proposed to organise Two monthsmobilisation so that pre-proclamationmen go to Germany first, a com-pletely new reinforcement plan wouldneed to be made. Two monthsConclusion5. Without a proclamation the most practicable means of visiblyimproving the operational capability of B. A. O, R. is to implement theproposals at paragraph 3 (Method l) without any compensating withdrawals.Any other course would disrupt mobilisation plans.6. With a proclamation and general mobilisation B, A. O. R. &apos;sman-power requirements        be met.   With the country on a war footingthis can be done in 7 days, but in peace conditions, would take very muchlonger.R. A. F. GERMANY7. R. A. F. Germany can be brought to war strength by measureswithin the authority of the Secretary of State.   All but 180 specialistscan be found within the Command.   These 180 specialists would have tocalled up from Section A of Class &apos;E&apos; of the Reserve.8. The successive measures to reinforce R. A. F. Germanywithout putting all R. A. F. Commands on a war footing would be:-(a) Recall of up to 180 Reservists on authority of the Secretary ofState.(b) Drafting into Germany of the Reservists at (a) and possiblysome personnel from Commands at home.Seven days(country onwar footing)Two months(otherwise)-2-TOP SECRET
TOP SECRETt9. If the intention were to place the R. A. F. as a whole ona global war footing a proclamation would be necessary for the re-inforcement of R. A. F. Commands at home and R. A, F. Malta.10. Special air lift arrangements, possibly including civil charterwould be necessary if R. A. F. Germany and B. A. O. R. were to bereinforced in isolation.   Reinforcement during a Berlin airlift would bedifficult.July, 1961-3-TOP SECRET
