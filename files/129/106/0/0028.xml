SECRET.168(THIS JjpCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJ.ESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 128 COPY NO. 113rd August, 1961CABINETTHE. &quot;PAUSE&quot; AND increases in. JAGgJANp salaries memorandum by tlae^CJiancellor^of Jthe, j3x^heguer1.       The Government has asked for a  jause in the increases of wagesand salaries generally.   We have said that in those areas for which weare directly responsible we intend to discharge our duty to give a lead ip.restraint, and that (subject to meeting commitments already entered into)we shall achieve a pause in our own capacity as an employer.   We have ;asked that the same policy shall be adopted elsewhere in the public sector and also in the private sector, in the confident expectation that if we do .our part other employers will not be backward iP- doing theirs.2,      The purpose of this pause is dual;  to give a breathing space forproductivity to catch up and to mark the beginning of a long-term policy for ensuring a sensible relationship between increases in incomes of all sortsand increases in productivity.3.      The length of the pause has not been defined and it is impoliticto define it precisely.   What I had in mind was that there should be nowage increases until the productivity record for 1961 could be examined,and not then unless the record warranted them.   By that time, I would hope to have made some progress over methods of carrying out thepurpose set outaaparagraph 2.4.      Unless we can secure the pause in the employments we directlycontrol, in  particular the Civil Service (non-industrial and industrial)and the National Health Service, we cannot expect that it will be securedelsewhere.   It is therefore necessary to decide what needs to be done to ensure that we do achieve a pause where v/e are directly responsible.We cannot assume that it will be achieved by exhortation.   No reliance canbe placed on the unions exercising restraint and the root question is, what should be done about the arbitration arrangements which normally apply in these fields.   No reliance can be placed on arbitrators securing the pausefor us:  indeed it can be argued that it would be harmful to the future ofthe arbitration machinery (which we must assume to be part of the long- ,term -policy) for arbitrators now to appear to be the tools of the Govern--rnent.   Moreover unless we can take some steps to control arbitration weshall be in  anger of discriminating against those who have no right to go to arbitration:  that is, not only the teachers but also, for example, the armed Forces.   The Appendix to this paper describes the arbitrationarrangements in the Civil Service and the National Health Service andshows how far control.&quot; esc. arbitration would involve breaches of agreementsmade or undertakings given by the Government of the day.   It will be seenthat technically the National Health Service position is not quite on allfours with that of the Civil Service.   Eut I think there is no doubt that weshould treat the National Health Service in this respect in the same way as we treat the Civil Service, and that v/e are in a position to do so.-1-
5.      Three possible courses have been suggested:-(i) To continue to allow access to arbitration, to wait and see what happens, being prepared but not saying so in advance, to rejectawards or to defer putting them into effect;(ii) To suspend arbitration (and negotiations) for a period.(iii) To allow the negotiating machinery to continue to function,leading in some cases to negotiated settlements with unspecified forwarddates;  and to announce that while access to arbitration will continuethe Government intends to control the timing, and if necessaiy the stages,of the implementation of any increases awarded.All these courses will provoke a storm.   In fact the pause cannotbe secured without a storm.6.      Course (i) would rouse it is said the wrath hot only of the unions,but also of the arbitrators.   The Government would be accused of duplicity,for if it allows the existing machinery to work apparently as usual, itv/ill be assumed that the Government intends that the arrangements standin their entirety.7.      Course (ii) - the suspension of arbitration would certainly securethe pause.   It would mean announcing the suspension of the WhitleyAgreement on Arbitration in the Civil Service.   It would be regardedas introducing not a pause but a complete freeze, a term with unfortunateconnotations and one which we have been at pains to avoid.   Even inthe days of the Labour Governments wage freeze there was no interferencewith arbitration.If arbitration were suspended it would follow that negotiations(unless any were regarded as existing commitments) v/ould be suspendedtoo.   From the Official Side&apos;s point of view there would be no point in such negotiations and in any event the staff representatives  would almost certainly refuse to negotiate.   If negotiations were suspended in thearbitrable sector it would follow that there could be no negotiations in those &quot;.areas where arbitration is not applicable - in particular the forthcomingReview of the Pay of the Armed Forces v/ould have to be suspended.   Itwould be intolerable to conduct such a review if there were a freezeelsewhere.There v/ould be great unrest and maybe strikes, even in theCivil Service.   It is likely that no only would the unions be incensed, butthe arbitrators too.   If this were so there v/ould be serious danger of long-term damage to the machinery.Moreover when arbitration was permitted again there would bean unmanageable flood of claims fought with great bitterness and arbitratedon by disgruntled arbitrators.8.      Course (iii) - the continued function of the machinery subject onlyto the removal of operative date from the scope of arbitration - would alsobe a breach of existing agreements and understandings.   But it has theadvantage of maintaining the machinery intact;   and as compared withcourse (i) it has the advantage of honesty - both the unions and the arbitrators
would know -where they stood.    It also has the advantage of flexibilityand would permit the immediate inaplemeptation of awards on cases whichit was decided came into the category of existing commitments.   Itwould seem to be more in accordance v/ith the idea of a pause - as distinct from a freese - and might be more acceptable to public opinion generallythan the complete suspension of arbitration.It has of course the disadvantage that we should be building upa batch of post-dated cheques.       But in my view this is a less serious disadvantage than the disadvantage under course (ii)  of build up a backlogof claims and negotiations themselves.9.      An early decision is required as, meanwhile, no answers canbe given to the increasingly insistent questions of the. unions and current negotiations are being conducted in an atmosphere of complete unreality.10.    If course (iii) were adopted for the Civil Service, then the Ministerof Labour would be able more easily to take the same line, as he proposesto do, with Wages Boards and Wages Councils.11. Local authorities and the nationalised industries might be per-persuaded to follow suit.12.    I should perhaps say a word about commitments already enteredinto which, in my statement, I said should be met.   The clearest cases are v/here pay settlements have already been reached in negotiation or where there have been arbitration proceedings and awards have alreadybeen made or are awaited.   An example is the recent award to professionalPost Office Engineers with retrospection to 1st August, 1958, costing 1. 5 millions this year.   Another is the awaited award on Post Officesales representatives.   All these must be implemented forthwith withwhatever operative date has been agreed or awarded. &apos; I would also regard as a commitment a case where an offer has been made  and rejected and a claim is on its way to arbitration.   Such axase is the offer of 5-g per cent from 1st January last which has been made to the Post Office engineering union. (This Union represents the non-professional engineering workers.)In my view this case, on which terms of reference have been agreed butnot yet forwarded to the Ministry of -Labour should now go to arbitration and any award up to the offered S\ per cent should be put into effect immediately.   If the award exceeds 5j per cent there will be no Governmentcommitment in respect of the excess and its implementation should,strictly speaking, be deferred during the pause;  but this aspect and theterms on which the Postmaster-General should announce his agreement to go to arbitration despite the need for a pause need very careful and separate consideration. .13.     There may be other negotiations which should be regardedas commitments and decisions will have to be taken on them as they come up.   We are likely in this connection to be faced with a verydifficult problem over   the three scientific classes of the Civil Service.Negotiations are now going on on the Pay Research Unit survey of these classes which is the last big survey of the first round of investigationsby the Unit following the Priestley Report.

The clearest cases are where pay settlements have already been reached in negotiation or where there have been arbitration proceedings and awards have alreadybeen made or are awaited.   An example is the recent award to professionalPost Office Engineers with retrospection to 1st August, 195C, costing 1. 5 millions this year.   Another is the awaited award on Fost Officesales representatives.   All these must be implemented forthwith, withwhatever operative date has been agreed or awarded. &apos; I would also regard as a commitment a case where an offer has been made  and rejected and a claim is on its way to arbitration.   Such a Tease is the offer of Zj per cent from 1st January last which has been made to the Fost office engineering union. (This Union represents the non-professional engineering workers.)In my view this case, on which terms of reference have been agreed butnot yet forwarded to the Ministry of Labour should now go to arbitration and any award up to the offered 5f per cent should be put into effect immediately.   If the award exceeds 5^ per cent there will be no Governmentcommitment in respect of the excess and its implementation should,strictly speaking, be deferred during the pause;  but this aspect and theterms on which the Postmaster-General should announce his agreement to go to arbitration despite the need for a pause need very careful and separate consideration.13.

We are likely in this connection to be faced with a verydifficult problem over   the three scientific classes of the Civil Service.Negotiations are now going on on the Pay Research Unit survey of these classes which is the last big survey of the first round of investigationsby the Unit following the Friestley Report.   I shall have to consider very
carefully to what extent the Government are committed to make offers of increased pay on the basis of the survey.   Another difficult issue will arise over pay claims by Government industrial staff where it will be argued that the Government is committed inter alia to a review of certainrates in October to bring them in to line with rates paid outside.14.    Decisions are urgently required as it is important that thereshould be an early announcement of the Government1 s intentions.   as parliament is about to rise, the Governmenfs decisions would be bestpromulgated by letters addressed to the various bodies which representthe Civil Service staffs and the National Health Service in pay negotia-tionc.   The letters would at the same time be released to the Press.Steps would also have to be taken to bring the Governmenfs decisionsspecifically to the attention of the nationalised corporations and localauthorities and to seek their agreement to the adoption of similar policies.S.

APPENDDCARBITRATION IN THE PUBLIC sector the Non-Industrial Civil service.      Under a Whitley Council Agreement of 1925 there is provision for compulsory arbitration on the pay of grades up to a certain level, atpresent those with scales not exceeding about  2,400 a year.   In 1925the Government also gave a pledge tnat &quot;subject to the over-ridingauthority of Parliament&quot; it would give effect to the awards of the CivilService Arbitration Tribunal.2.       Two of the alternative courses suggested in this paper are thatthe Government should decide either:-(i) To suspend arbitration, or(ii) In effect to announce that for the time being the operative date of any increases in pay awarded by the Tribunal will not be arbitrable.3.     There is no provision in the Agreement it self, or elsewhere, forsuspension of this system of compulsory arbitration;   and the Staff side would undoubtedly regard a decision to suspend arbitration an a unilateralrepudiation of the Agreement.4. 1   If the Government decided, for a time, that the operative dateof any pay increases should cease to be arbitrable the Staff Side would undoubtedly regard this as a unilateral variation, and perhapsrepudiation, of the Agreement.   But this course of action would no doubt be less repugnant to the Staff Side than a complete suspension of arbitration,and it could be argued that it did not amount to a repudiation of the basis on which the Government of the day originally authorised the 1925 agreement the Government has always reserved to itself the right to refuse arbitration&quot;on grounds of policy&quot;.   Over the years this reserved power has beeninvoiced on only five occasions - in relation to claims for equal pay for womefamily allowances, cost of living bonuses, and (in war-time) balance   of civipay - on the grounds that these were matters on which the Government hadalready announced its decision, or was considering as a matter of highGovernment policy.   These were refusals to arbitrate at all and could notbe held to constitute direct precedents for a refusal to arbitrate on the operative date of any pay increases.   Eut it could be maintained that as theGovernment have decided as a matter of high Government policy that therehad to be &quot;a pause&quot; in increases of wages and salaries it was entirelyright that they should use the power which they had reserved to themselvesto decide that a particular aspect of wage and salary claims should befor the time being inarbitrable.National Health service the National Health Service (Amendment) Act of 1949 provides thatany difference or dispute about pay or conditions of service of personsemployed or engaged in the provision of service under the Acts shall bea dispute within the meaning of the Industrial Courts Act, 1919.   This moansthat the consent of both sides of the Health Service \7hitley Councils is
required before there can. be arbitration.   Thus there is no right to compulsory arbitration though in practice consent has&apos; not been withheldby the management sides unless public policy is involved.   Also theMinister can reject a Whitley Agreement based upon an arbitration award.   But since the management sides include only a minority ofMinistry officials, they could, if they were not amenable to persuasionby the Minister, allow the staff sides to go to arbitration, whether theMinister liked it or not; and a rejection by the Minister,   for the first time, of an arbitration award -would undoubtedly create a great storm.August, 1961-6-
