TOP secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTTS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1961The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. It is issued for the personal ose of...........................................................Copy No.C. (61) 1402nd October, 1961CABINETKUWAITMemorandum by the Lord Privy SealOn 5th September, when the Cabinet discussed the memorandum by theMinister of Defence (C. (61) 133) about our future military dispositions for theprotection of Kuwait, they agreed that immediate steps should be taken to establish a stockpile of British equipment in Kuwait, but deferred approval of additional,accommodation in Bahrain pending a review of our policy towards Kuwait(C.C. (61) 49th Conclusions, Minute 5). This question was remitted in the firstplace to an official committee under the chairmanship of the Foreign Officecontaining representatives of the Ministry of Defence, Treasury and Ministry of power.  I attach as an annex the agreed report which they have submitted.2. This report draws attention to the vital importance of Kuwait to our middle east oil interests and emphasises the advantages to this country, both in supplies andin the balance of payments, which flow from the operations of the British companies in an independent, affluent and friendly Kuwait and from kuwait&apos;s readiness toaccept and hold sterling. It reaffirms that our best chance of protecting these interests lies in the preservation of an independent Kuwait ready to co-operate with the United Kingdom, and it considers various ways in which this situation could be upset.3. The main threat comes of course from Iraq, and although the programme for expanding the Kuwait armed forces is under way, it cannot be expected thatthey could do more than hold up for a short period an Iraqi attempt to occupy the State. While the Arab League contingents remain in Kuwait they will be valuable as a politico-military deterrent to Iraq, but it cannot be expected thatthey will stay there for any great length of time. The Amir of Kuwait continuesto rely on us to intervene again quickly enough to save the territory should heappeal to us for help in the future; if we are to preserve Kuwaiti co-operation andalso our positions elsewhere in the Gulf, we must retain the confidence of the Amirthat we would be able to come to his help in time in case of need.4. The paper examines whether there are any alternatives to a policy ofmaintaining United Kingdom forces in readiness to come to kuwait&apos;s help, butreaches the conclusion that, important as it is for Kuwait to undertake a programmeof financial investment in the rest of the Arab world, neither this nor any purelypolitical measures can be relied on to provide an adequate insurance against anIraqi attack. The only really satisfactory military insurance would be the stationing of adequate British forces in Kuwait itself, but this is unacceptable tothe Kuwaitis. The next best is the Chiefs of Staff plan for reinforcing the Kuwaitiforces within a period of 36 hours from warning being given of an impendingIraqi attack. This requires the building of additional air-conditionedaccommodation in Bahrain at the cost of about  500,000, and if it is to be ready
by the hot weather -in 1962 a decision is required now. Coupled with our other military arrangements, it would enable us to carry out the Chiefs of Staff planso long as we can maintain our strategic reserve in Kenya.5. Unfortunately it may no longer be possible to do this after the end of 1962,and, as the paper points out, work on re-providing this base elsewhere in the areaought to start at once if it is to be ready by then. This would, however, be a bigcommitment involving capital expenditure of the order of some  10 millions, as wellas depriving us of the saving of  5 millions a year and  1 \ millions of the remainingworks programme which our departure from Kenya would otherwise enable us tomike. The paper states the estimated capital and maintenance costs of carryingout the Chiefs of Staff plan on the alternative assumptions that we retain and thatwe lose the Kenya base (paragraphs 18 and 19). It also considers two less effectivemilitary arrangements; one of these (paragraph 21) could only have a limited value in deterring the Iraqis from an attack and the other (paragraph 24) might havesomewhat more, but neither would enable an effective military defence of Kuwaitto be carried out if the need arose.6. The conclusion of the paper is that the Departments agree to recommendthat an immediate decision should be made to provide the additional accommodationrequired in Bahrain, but that in view of the uncertainties of the situation and the considerable costs involved, a decision on whether the Kenya base should bere-provided elsewhere in the area should be deferred until Ministers can consider our future defence programme as a whole.7. I agree with these recommendations and submit them for the approval ofthe Cabinet. Construction of the additional accommodation in Bahrain will enable us to provide a reasonable military insurance against Kuwait being overrun byIraq at least until the end of next year. Although there is some risk entailed indelaying a decision about our long-term military arrangements, I think that- the considerable cost of building a new base for the strategic reserve justifies us in doing so until the problem can be seen against the background of our defence programme as a whole. I would hope that the necessary decisions on this can be taken fairlysoon, since our interests in Kuwait are great and if it is decided that we must makethe necessary military arrangements to defend them effectively in the period after1962, we should not put them at risk for any longer than we can possibly help.8.   Accordingly I recommend that:(a) An immediate decision should be made to go ahead with the constructionof the additional air-conditioned accommodation in Bahrain.(b) The long-term problem of what our defence dispositions should be for theprotection of Kuwait, having regard to the expected withdrawal fromthe Kenya base, should be considered as part of our defence programme as a whole but a decision on this should not be long delayed.E. H.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,2nd October, 1961.
4dkKUWAITReport by OfficialsUnited Kingdom Interests in KuwaitOur economic interest in Kuwait* arises from the following factors:(a) The size and accessibility of its vast oil reserves and the case with whichthey can be extracted and transported. Since British Petroleum has a half share in the Kuwait Oil Company&apos;s concession and Shell buys onfavourable terms the bulk of the American partners half share, Kuwaitoil is of great importance and profit to them and to the United kingdom balance of payments. In 1960 British Petroleum drew 98 per cent,of their supplies from the Middle East, 51 per cent, from Kuwait. Shellmet 40 per cent, of their business outside the Americas from kuwait and hope to find profitable oil in the off-shore concession which theyhave been awarded.(b) Because of its independence, affluence and friendship with us Kuwaitstands in the way of a consolidation of control of Middle East oil byone or more of the remaining major Middle East producers (Iraq, SaudiArabia and Iran) or transit States (the United Arab Republic), and thusprovides a valuable insurance that oil will continue to flow from theMiddle East in adequate quantities and on reasonable terms (the middle east supplies three-quarters of the oil used outside the Americas).(c) kuwait&apos;s membership of the sterling area and readiness to accept payment for oil in sterling and to hold substantial amounts of sterling.Our general political objective in Kuwait is the same as in other parts of the persian gulf, namely the maintenance of stability and the encouragement of good relationswith neighbouring countries, in order to reduce the risk of Communist penetrationthrough the exploitation of discontent or the jealousies of others.2. Our best chance of protecting our economic interests lies in the preservation of an independent Kuwait, under the present regime if possible, and the continuanceof co-operation between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Kuwait Government.These conditions are far more likely to safeguard our interest than a Kuwaitabsorbed by or falling wholly under the influence of other States in the area. Inparticular, changes to our disadvantage in the present financial arrangementsconnected with the oil operations would be less likely, or at least would be slowed down, not only in Kuwait itself but also in the other oil producing countriesaround the Persian Gulf who would be less inclined to press the companies too faras long as the latter can draw freely upon the enormous potential production of Kuwait.Threats to United Kingdom Interests in Kuwait3. kuwait&apos;s independence and her readiness to co-operate with us could beupset in the following different ways:(a) An attack by Iraq.(b) An attack by Saudi Arabia.* In a paper entitled &quot; Kuwait and Middle East Oil&quot; which was circulated on 4th August tothe Future Policy Working Group, an attempt was made to prepare an up-to-date assessment of our economic stake in the Middle East. As the Chancellor of the Exchequer explained in his coveringminute to the Prime Minister, it proved impossible, owing to the many uncertainties, to forecast at all precisely what might happen to our oil interests. Subject to this, the main conclusions of thepaper, in terms of figures, were summarised as follows:(a) If the British companies were excluded from the Middle East, the additional cost to our balance of payments would probably not be less than  200 millions a year, and mightbe very much more.(b) If, the likelier possibility, the British companies were able to continue operating in theMiddle East but with a substantially reduced share of production profits, the additional cost to the balance of payments would still be substantial, perhaps of the order of 100 millions.59715cANNEX
(c) A take-over resulting from an agreement to divide the spoils between twr^or more of the main contenders (which might also include Jordan); this^danger might arise during the period when Kuwait is defended by an arab League force, or later.(d) A change in regime, probably as a result of subversion by Arab nationalistsunder the inspiration, if not with the complicity, of President Nasser.(e) A change in the present regime&apos;s policy, concerning either the terms of theKuwait Oil Company&apos;s concession (applying also in the longer term toShelFs offshore concession) or the Kuwait Governmenfs readiness tomaintain their friendly policy towards the United Kingdom and toaccept and hold sterling, as a result of external influence, felt possiblythrough the Organisation for Petroleum Exporting Countries, or through pan-Arab or Afro-Asian neutralist propaganda.United Kingdom Military Assistance to Kuwait4. Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs present commitment is contained in sub-paragraph (d) of the Anglo-Kuwaiti Exchange of Notes of 19th June, 1961, which reads as follows: &quot; Nothing in these conclusions shall affect the readiness of her majesty&apos;s Government to assist the Government of Kuwait if the latter requestsuch assistance &quot;. The Exchange of Notes did not specify the matters on whichKuwait might ask for assistance but it was stated by the Lord Privy Seal in theHouse of Commons that the undertaking covered assistance to meet external aggression and internal subversion, if Kuwait so requested. It was in accordancewith this undertaking that we sent forces to Kuwait on 1st July and are setting upin Kuwait a stockpile of military equipment, supervised by a team of Britishliaison personnel, for the use of British forces if their return to Kuwait is requested by the Ruler in the period after they have withdrawn. When we recommendedthat the Kuwait armed forces should be expanded and equipped to an improvedstandard, we suggested that they ought to be made capable of holding the points of entry against an Iraqi attack for a period of thirty-six hours to allowreinforcements to arrive. The Amir was thus left in no doubt that at that time wewere planning to reinforce him in time to prevent Iraqi forces over-running Kuwait.5. This period of thirty-six hours, in which intervention would have to takeplace if it were to be effective, would provide us with a considerably shorter warningperiod than the four days we counted on in the past. The openly expressed natureof the Iraqi threat, our experience of the difficulties in securing accurate intelligenceof Iraqi military preparations and our revised assessments of the possible speed and effectiveness of Iraqi attack from the Basra area all show the need for assuming the shorter period. There is no assurance that the Kuwaiti forces, when expandedand trained, will be capable of holding up an Iraqi attack for as much as thirty-sixhours and that in the intervening period the help of the Arab League contingents with their limited military potential and unknown fighting qualities will enablethem to do so. The danger will be reduced to the extent of the deterrent value ofour own forces in the area. The question of what dispositions might be suitablefor these purposes, and their financial implications, is considered later in this paper.6. It can of course be assumed that the Amir and the ruling family, thoughanxious to have a British force in readiness to intervene again, will be reluctant to invite our armed forces to return to Kuwait once they have left. No Arab rulerwishes to be beholden to foreign armed forces, least of all to non-Arab forces, andthe amir&apos;s concern to keep to a minimum the number of British liaison personnel,who may serve as a target for nationalist criticism, is a sign of this. But the factthat he has accepted the stockpile and the need for liaison personnel shows thathe realises that the threat from Iraq has not been removed, that the Arab Leagueforce, though a political deterrent, may not be an effective military one and thathe may feel compelled to invite us to return if there is an immediate Iraqi threat.The Arab League force may well not remain in being beyond the beginning of thehot weather in 1962. It is very unlikely that its presence in Kuwait will be prolongedbecause of the overriding Arab preoccupation with Israel. The Amir informed us, when accepting the Arab League force, that he continued to rely upon our ability to intervene again if necessary. It is therefore primarily for their value both as a military deterrent, reinforcing the mainly political deterrent of the arab league and Kuwaiti forces and, through their capacity to intervene again quickly,as an insurance that Kuwait will not be overrun by an attacker that our military dispositions should be seen.
f) 7. The value of our military support of Kuwait will, however, be more than&quot;this; it will also help to reduce the threats at(d) and (c) of paragraph 3. Bysustaining the morale of the ruling family, by giving them the confidence and theopportunity to adapt their method of government to the needs of the modern world,which they are slowly but surely doing, and by maintaining their confidence in us,we have the best chance that the Government of Kuwait, while maintaining their independence will co-operate with Her Majesty&apos;s Government and give a fair deal to the oil companies. If the Kuwaitis lose confidence in us, they will probably seek to reinsure with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Republic (U.A.R.). The resultof such reinsurance would probably be at least to hasten changes in Kuwaiti policy to our disadvantage and at worst expose Kuwait to a subsequent Iraqi takeover.8. A Kuwaiti loss of confidence in us would also affect the confidence of the rulers in the remaining Gulf States. Oil discoveries in Abu Dhabi are promisingand these, taken together with the known fields in Qatar and Bahrain and thepossibility of oil strikes in Oman, may come to weigh increasingly in our calculations.In the worst case, if we fail to ensure the security of Kuwait, we might expect acrumbling of our position in the remainder of the Gulf, owing both to the loss ofconfidence among other Rulers in our protection and to the conclusions whichSaudi Arabia would draw about our willingness or ability to continue to safeguard our friends.Alternatives to Military Assistance9. It is natural to ask whether a similar insurance could not be obtainedwithout the considerable military and financial effort which we shall have tomaintain. Could we take the risk of ignoring the threats at (a)-(d) of paragraph 3and assume that kuwait&apos;s membership of the Arab League, and perhaps later ofthe United Nations, would give her sufficient security? If so, could we assume thatthe Amir would continue to co-operate with us and the oil companies so that wecould avoid the threat at (e)l It is possible, though far from certain, that the riskof attack from Saudi Arabia or of subversion by the U.A.R. could be discounted,provided the Kuwait Government followed sensible policies, but the threat from iraq is in a different class, given the unpredictable and conspiratorial nature ofGeneral qassim&apos;s and his need for a striking success to bolster his position in iraq and the Arab world. For him, the seizure of Kuwait would represent a tremendoussuccess, and at least for so long as he is in control of Iraqi policy (and we cannot atthis stage assume that a successor would be more trustworthy or accommodating),there is bound to be a serious danger that the Iraqi claim will be pursued by violentmeans if the Iraqis see a chance of success. There is no political instrument opento us to influence General qassim&apos;s against pursuing his claim; indeed his inflexibleattitude towards the Iraq Petroleum Company is likely in any case to make ourrelations with him difficult.10. The only political course open to the Amir to reduce the threats to Kuwaitis the adoption of policies designed to strengthen his regime internally, and make it more acceptable to Arab opinion both in his own population and in the surroundingcountries. Kuwait is already a welfare State, but it is still largely administered onfeudal lines. The Amir is, however, actively engaged in trying to modernise his administration, with the assistance of a recent mission from the International Bank.Attempts at democratisation have not in the past led to any real result, but it hasnow been announced that elections to a constituent assembly will be held inDecember. More important from the point of view of the other Arab governments is the Kuwait Governments investment policy. Hitherto the bulk of KuwaitGovernment money has been invested on the London market with lelatively small amounts in America and Western Europe; only an insignificant beginning has beenmade with investment in other Arab countries. This has long been a matter ofreproach in the Arab world and it is clear that the Kuwaiti authorities already have in mind the possibility of increasing their investment somewhat in the arab countries. The development of such an investment programme on a substantial scale would be the most effective way of improving kuwait&apos;s standing, especially inthe U.A.R. and Jordan, which are most in need of finance; thus both the risk of arab nationalist subversion in Kuwait and that of Arab efforts to undermine our oil and financial arrangements would be reduced. Her Majesty&apos;s Government haveno control over kuwait&apos;s investment policy but we should clearly take every opportunity available to us of giving appropriate encouragement to the Amir todevelop soon a forward investment policy in the Arab countries, even if it should59715
mean that there was a risk that Kuwaiti investments in London would in time ba^somewhat run down. If, as is likely, a good deal of Kuwaiti investment in Ara^Fcountries is channelled through the proposed Arab League development bank, someof the funds might even find their way to Iraq. There would be some advantage inthis but it could not be expected to have any substantial influence on GeneralQassim&apos;s policy, and we can see no other way in which the Amir might buy off theIraqis.11. It is a theoretical possibility that Kuwait might be defended by a united nations force. It is, however, unlikely that agreement could be obtained in theUnited Nations to the establishment of such a force, both because the united nations is already heavily burdened in the Congo and elsewhere and also on financial grounds. Even if one could be established, it would be unlikely to be effectivebecause its operations would be subject to veto by the Soviet Union, which hasalready, through the use of the veto during the debate in July, shown its oppositionto propping up what it considers to be a Western-dominated State. The same considerations would not apply to the provision of United Nations observers on thefrontier, but they would make no material contribution to the effective defence of Kuwait. It is hoped that Kuwait will before long be admitted as a member of theUnited Nations (the U.A.R. have agreed to sponsor) and in the long run this should,by broadening the international acceptance of Kuwait, make aggression against it,less likely.Danger from Arab League Forces12. A special word should be said about the possibility, referred to inparagraph 3 (d) that during the period when the Arab League force is present in kuwait, one or more of the contributing countries might seek to take the territoryover. Possibilities which will be at least theoretically present are: an agreement bythe U.A.R., Saudi Arabia and Jordan to divide the spoil; an attempt by Jordan,with the connivance and later support of Iraq, to attempt a coup on its own; or asingle-handed attempt by Saudi Arabia, using forces from its own territory, or by .A.R. with the aid of local Arab nationalists. These dangers must have been present in the Amir&apos;s mind, but he must have decided to take the risk, relying upon his own forces and the balance of numbers within the Arab League force to discourage single-handed action; also his present intention is that the Arab Leagueforces shall remain near the frontier while the Kuwait forces are stationed near thetown. The dangers clearly cannot be entirely discounted and it would be virtually impossible for British forces in Bahrain to arrive in time to avert a lightning strokeby those on the spot. On the other hand, the presence of these forces near at handwill be of value as a deterrent, and for the rest it will be necessary to rely on the considerations mentioned above. Here again, an early indication that larger KuwaitiGovernment investments would be made in the Arab world would be a help toreduce the risks.Duration of Threat to Kuwait13. We conclude that neither the Amir nor Her Majesty&apos;s Government have any purely political means open to them to reduce the risk of an Iraqi attack, whichwe consider is bound to remain a serious one for so long as General qassim&apos;s remains in power. It may be that as time passes kuwait&apos;s gradual acquisition of the main features of a modern State, her membership of the United Nations, and her steadilyimproving standing with the other Arab countries and the rest of the world willsomewhat reduce the likelihood of an Iraqi attack. In a few years time we might feel that greater risks could be taken, and the Amir or perhaps by that time his successor, would consider that he need no longer call upon us for support(the 19th June Exchange of Notes provided for the possibility of terminating theagreement on giving three years notice). Such a development cannot however be counted on, and it would seem reasonable to assume that the dilemma facing us would continue at least into the second half of the 1960s.Military Measures14. The broad conclusion from the above is that our main objectives withregard to Kuwait will require for an indefinite period a combination of political andmilitary measures designed to counter threats of violent action by Iraq orconceivably Saudi Arabia.   There remains the question what level of military
/;jgresence it is reasonable for us to maintain in the light of our assessment of the risks\4Pnd the availability of our resources.15. Iraq could it is estimated bring to bear against Kuwait an infantry divisionsupported by tanks and a parachute unit in an infantry role. We might receive four days warning of the arrival of these forces on the frontier, although we could not count on doing so. Of this force up to a strengthened brigade with tanks couldattack Kuwait without any warning at all. Against such a threat the only completemilitary insurance would be the stationing of British forces in considerable strength in the territory of Kuwait itself. Such a solution is politically unacceptable to the amir, having regard to Arab opinion.16. Plans have therefore been prepared by the Chiefs of Staff for intervention by a force that with a four-day warning period would be sufficient to defend Kuwaitagainst the maximum threat that Iraq could pose and at the same time would enablesufficient forces to be introduced into Kuwait within thirty-six hours to take over from the defenders there and hold the points of entry into Kuwait against an Iraqiattack in brigade strength until our total force was assembled about sixty hours later17. These plans involve a number of changes in the deployment we had before our recent intervention. In particular it would be necessary to station in Bahraina battalion and some armour. This will involve building additional air-conditionedaccommodation there; if it is to be ready by the next hot weather our immediate decision to incur the expenditure of about  0-5 million is necessary.18. The plans depend, as did our earlier plan for intervention, on the existenceof the strategic reserve in Kenya. So long as we can retain our facilities in Kenyathe costs in terms of overseas expenditure of the deployment in aid of Kuwait are:CapitalAnnual WorksMaintenance      1962-63Costs        to 1966-67Forces   millions         millions3 frigates  and  AmphibiousWarfare Squadron         ... 1-1 1-05  Army units in Aden andthe Gulf     ......... 5-6C) 11-82f units in Kenya     ...... 3-3 0-8 (1962-63 to 1963-64)R.A.F. in Aden and Gulf    ... 4-1 7-4R.A.F. in Kenya      ...... 1-7 0-8 (1962-63 to 1963-64)Total        ...... 15-8 21-8Note : (*) Includes Aden Federal Army.It should be noted that there is no provision here for the increased costs of rotation,referred to in C. (61) 133. It has not proved possible to give a reliable estimate ofthese but the extra cost is unlikely to be large.19. It would be unrealistic, however, to assume that we can rely on the useof Kenya after the end of 1962 and the total costs of the proposed force if weprovided accommodation in the Arabian Peninsula for the forces now in Kenyaallotted to Kuwait under this plan, would be as follows:A annual Maintenance       Capital WorksCosts 1962-63 to 1966-67Forces                           millions   millions3 frigates and Amphibious WarfareSquadron.........      ...       1-1 1-08 army units in Aden and Gulf   ...       8-3C) 19-0(2)R.A.F. in Aden and Gulf  .......      5-8 8-15Total      .........      15-2 28-15Notes: (*) Includes Aden Federal Army.(2) Includes  1-2 millions for temporary accommodation.
8TOP SECRET20.   The deployment described above is considered by the Chiefs of Staff &amp; )be the bare minimum to permit effective intervention in present circumstances:Lower levels of forces however might be regarded as having value as a deterrent.For purposes of illustration two deployments have been taken for which cost figures are available.21. The first is a bare military presence in the Arabian Peninsula consistingof the same forces that we had two years ago in Aden and the Persian Gulf. Sofar as Kuwait is concerned this deployment would not allow the introduction of an effective defending force once an Iraqi attack had begun. Thus if action was thenthought necessary we should be compelled to mount an operation to eject the Iraqiswho would by then be firmly installed in Kuwait. Such an operation, particularlyafter we had given up our base in Kenya, would take a good many weeks to mountand involve the gravest military and political difficulties. Hence this level ofmilitary presence by itself could only have a limited deterrent effect to the extent thatthe Iraqis might believe that it was an earnest of our intention to mount an operation to eject them if they occupy Kuwait. The oversea costs of such a militarypresence would be as follows:Annual Maintenance      Capital WorksCosts 1962-63 to 1966-67Forces                           millions   millions3 frigates      ...      .........       0-45 1-02^ army units in Aden and Gulf  ...       2-7C) 9-0R.A.F. in Aden and Gulf......       4-1 7-3Total      .........       7-25 17-note: (x) Includes Aden Federal Army.22. The second illustrative level of deployment amounts to what we shouldhave had in the Arabian Peninsula in 1962 on the basis of our previous planninghad we not had occasion to intervene in Kuwait this year; the costs include those for the accommodation of a major unit in Aden. It assumes, however, that the kenya base had been lost and that we had decided not to provide accommodation in the area for the Kenya reserves allotted to Kuwait.23. With such a deployment, although some troops could be introducedquickly into Kuwait in response to an appeal from the Ruler, the force would be unable to hold an initial Iraqi attack at brigade strength without warning, evenif it were held up by thirty-six hours by local defenders, or an Iraqi attack atdivisional strength with, say, four days warning. Thus if we decided to intervene in the face of such attacks on Kuwait, unless the mere fact of our interventionfrightened off the Iraqis, we should have to reckon on our forces being defeated ordriven out. The deterrent effect of such forces by themselves, bearing in mind thestockpile of tanks and other equipment in Kuwait, might be somewhat greaterthan that of our bare military presence described above. It should convince theIraqis that we could still intervene at least as effectively and rapidly as we did lasttime, but this would not necessarily by itself deter an attack in view of the capability of the Iraqis to overrun Kuwait without providing long enough warning for us to intervene in time.24.   The oversea costs of this deployment would be as follows:Annual Maintenance Capital WorksForce, r C?,?-S            1962-63 to 1966-67-it-   millions                  millions3 frigates and Amphibious WarfareSquadron   ...... 2 . jH army units in Aden and Gulf &apos;.&apos;.&apos;. 4 - 9C)                   1).&apos; ?R.A.F.

Conclusions^* 25. Our economic stake in Kuwait itself, and the central position of Kuwaitto our oil operations in this whole area, are such that we should take all reasonablemeasures that we can to protect Kuwait. There may in the long run be a risk that changes to our disadvantage in the oil companies&apos; operations will in any eventoccur, but our aim must be to delay them. There are no really effective politicalmeans for us to achieve our objectives in Kuwait. However successful the arab league force may be in providing a temporary political deterrent against action by Iraq, we do not believe that its value will persist, even if the force remainedindefinitely, which is highly unlikely. The Kuwait armed forces should be considerably improved in strength and effectiveness, but even so they will; never be in a position by themselves to withstand a deliberate Iraqi attack. Consequently,it can be argued that a British military presence in the area must be maintainedwhich is sufficient both to deter Iraq by being demonstrably in a position to preventIraqi forces overrunning Kuwait and, failing deterrence, to intervene in time tohold Kuwait itself in the face of Iraqi attacks on the scale and timing that webelieve to be possible. No lesser military presence will achieve our objective in kuwait. Such a deployment of forces will entail an immediate decision to buildextra air-conditioned accommodation in Bahrain and an immediate decision toreprovide accommodation in the area for the remainder of the Kenya forcesnecessary to enable the Chiefs of Staff plans to be implemented. Despite the costs of this reprovision it can be argued that, compared with the size of the economic benefits which we derive from the maintenance of the independence of Kuwaitunder the present regime, the expenditure is well worth while.26. It must be admitted that the above analysis rests on a number ofimponderable factors and that it inevitably includes elements of doubt. despite the expressed wish of the Amir of Kuwait that we should remain in a position to intervene effectively in the future, the State of Kuwait has begun to draw closer to its Arab neighbours, other than Iraq, and the Amir&apos;s successor might be someonewho would wish to pursue this development more actively, and in the process todraw away from us. We cannot therefore be sure that in a future crisis we shouldreceive in time an appeal for assistance which would justify us in intervening.Moreover, developments in the Middle East are unpredictable, and we cannot besure that political changes in the area will not occur, e.g., in Saudi Arabia, Adenor in Iraq itself, which would alter the nature of the problem. It is also possiblethat we shall in any event lose some part of the economic benefits that we derive from Kuwait, as a result of the efforts now being made by the oil producing Statesthroughout the world to concert their policies with the object of gaining a larger share of the profits, if not some control, of the industry, which if successful wouldgive a lead which Kuwait would feel bound to follow. These uncertainties andthe development of a climate of Arab and world opinion opposed to military intervention by a Great Power in the quarrels of others, cannot be disregarded in circumstances where the financial cost of carrying out the only really effectivecourse of protecting our interests is so large.* To enable the Chiefs of Staff plans tobe carried out we should deprive ourselves of the saving that would accrue fromthe departure from Kenya of the forces earmarked for Kuwait (about  5 millions a year plus  1^ millions remaining works programme) and involve ourselves in capital expenditure of the order of some  10 millions to replace the Kenya base.There is bound to be a risk that by the time the new accommodation is complete the likelihood of our having to intervene in Kuwait would have seriously dwindledand even our security of tenure of existing bases in the area made less certain.27. We consider that, so far as the short-term is concerned, it would be rightto construct the proposed air-conditioned accommodation in Bahrain and to replace the Commando in Aden by the Parachute Battalion. These measures, costing some 0-5 million, would enable us to carry out the Chiefs of Staff plans should this benecessary during the period while we retain the Kenya base, and thus give us at leastreasonable security for a year or so. We have examined the possibility of asking the Amir to pay for the proposed accommodation. We believe, however, that, werehe to agree so to do, it would inevitably to some extent prejudice the possibility of along-term disengagement from our commitment to him and, since it is the long-term problem which raises the important financial issues, we do not recommend that weshould, in these circumstances, seek to secure a small short-term gain.* It must be emphasised that all the costs in this paper relate solely to overseas expenditure and that the budgetary costs, though unquantifiable, are significantly greater.
September 1961.28. As regards the long-term, however, the decision whether to reprovid^the Kenya base in the Arabian Peninsula is a much more difficult one and we think this might be deferred until Ministers consider the report of the Official Committeeon Future Policy covering our defence programme as a whole. Should it then bedecided to reprovide the Kenya base, there would inevitably be some delay afterthe departure from Kenya before the base could be ready, and therefore a period during which we could not be sure of implementing the Chiefs of Staff plans. Weconsider that this is a reasonable risk to take in view of the uncertainties ofthe situation.29. Pending decisions on long-term policy, we consider that our difficulties should be explained to our representative in Kuwait and that he should be instructedto bear them in mind in any discussions there may be about our long-term planning;he should be particularly careful not to create the impression that we shall be ableto maintain, for an indefinite period, our capacity to intervene in any particularstrength or in accordance with any specific timetable.
