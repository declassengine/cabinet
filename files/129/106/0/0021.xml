SECRET ^THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1961C. (61). 121 Copy No.    5 528th July, 1961CABINETBIRMINGHAM housing memorandum by the Paymaster-GeneralThe Committee on Birmingham Housing were set up in February last toconsider the principles on which sites should be selected for new building to meetthe future housing needs of Birmingham and other congested towns in the west midlands; and, in the light of those principles, what particular areas for development should be suggested to the local authorities concerned. As Chairman of theCommittee, I now report their conclusions to the Cabinet.background. I attach a map of the area we have been considering. The West Midlands(i.e., the five geographical counties of Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire,Herefordshire and Shropshire) face an enormous housing problem. It has been estimated that around 500,000 new houses will be needed over the next 20 years.It has also been estimated that without any special further measures on the partof the Government up to 450,000 houses may be built over that period by privateenterprise and local authority building within the West Midlands conurbation(i.e., in Birmingham together with the Black Country and residential suburbs), andby building elsewhere in the West Midlands including town expansions already agreed upon. The balance of 50,000 houses will only be built if sites are found for new towns or additional planned expansions are made of existing towns.3. The problem cannot, however, be dismissed as marginal. Slum clearancecannot proceed unless other sites are available on which to house the people whohave been living in the slums which are to be demolished. To carry out areasonable programme for its slum clearance and other housing needs, Birminghamalone would have to find land outside its own boundaries on which to build some3,000 local authority houses a year. By 1964, Birmingham will only be able to findsites outside its boundaries for 300^00 houses a year on the basis of existing plans.Apart from the embarrassment to the Government if Birmingham&apos;s slum clearancewere to come virtually to a halt, we are under a special obligation to assist in findingadditional sites because last year the Minister of Housing, in agreement with hiscolleagues, refused Birmingham permission to build or. 2,500 acres at Wythallwithin the Green Belt (which would have provided land for some 10,000 houses)and at the same time accepted a responsibility to try to help Birmingham with itsproblem of finding sites.4. A new town would have the great merit that, since it would be under theMinisters control, the highest practicable rate of house building would bemaintained. On the other hand, new towns require to be balanced with industrialdevelopment, and any proposal has to be considered against the danger that it mightattract industry which could and should move to development districts. Moreover,it is obviously right that the best possible use should be made of sites available in existing towns. For these reasons we concentrated our attention first on seeinghow far Birmingham^ needs could be met without the establishment of a new town.5941 1
Sites other than New Towns5. In the course of our discussions we considered a large number of sites inthe West Midlands and our conclusions are as follows:(a) Wythall (Birmingham Green Belt)We now think that Birmingham should be allowed to build at Wythall,. though not on all the 2,500 acres requested by the local authority last year, but* - i, only on 1,000 acres (of which 400 acres are already developed). This additional600 acres would provide sites for about 1,000 nouses a year for four yearsbeginning in 1964. The decision to allow this encroachment of the Green Beltwill undoubtedly rouse considerable local opposition but it will be in a part ofthe Green Belt where there is already much piecemeal development and wethink the opposition must be faced. To make the decision more acceptable to local opinion, however, it will be essential to demonstrate that the greatest possible use is being-made of other sites in the West Midlands.(b) Town ExpansionsThe Minister of Housing will urge the local authorities concerned to.proceed as rapidly as possible with town expansions at Redditch, Worcester andDaventry. Expansions that might produce local authority housing forBirmingham at a rate of 400 houses a year in Redditch, 200 a year in Worcesterand 100 a year in Daventry could proceed without any significant industrial,agricultural or transport complications. Indeed, we think that Redditch might in time be able to make a considerably bigger contribution towards solvingBirmingham&apos;s problem. The President of the Board of Trade, with the supportof the Minister of Housing, will try to ensure by means of his control overindustrial development certificates that expanding industry which could go tothe development districts is not located at these sites. The Presidents view is,however, that the amount of industry for which he could properly - givecertificates in the overspill sites is unlikely to provide sufficient employment for people moving to those sites; if, therefore, he has to find expanding industry for these sites as well as industry for other overspill schemes, there will be littleleft over for the development districts.6. Among other towns which we have considered for expansion areBurton-on-Trent, Kidderminster/Stourport, and Coventry. We think that someexpansion should take place at Burton, but as town expansions depend on securingthe agreement of the local authorities concerned, and as the Staffordshire CountyCouncil would object to expansion at Burton, we are satisfied that there is no prospect for the time being at least of any help from that direction. Similarly, therewould be strong opposition from the Worcester County Council to town expansionat Kidderminster/Stourport; nevertheless this area will provide land for considerable private housing development. Coventry is already being rapidlyexpanded to meet its own needs and we do not think that it can provide houses forBirmingham. No other town in the West Midlands is likely to be able to give any appreciable help to Birmingham.7. Thus we are able to foresee the possibility of 1,000 houses a year atWythall and some 700 houses a year in total at Redditch, Worcester andDaventry, in addition to the 300-400 houses a year which will come from existingplans. This falls well short of the 3,000 houses outside Birmingham&apos;s boundariesneeded for a reasonable programme to meet her slum clearance and other housing needs Moreover, the 600 acres that can be released at Wythall would all be built upon within four years. If Birmingham is to carry out a reasonable housing programme, therefore, a new town is needed in the area.A New Town8. The area has already been combed for suitable sites for a new town.We have given special consideration to the two most promising sites:(a) SwynnertonAt Swynnerton an attractive new town could be started quickly, using the site of a Royal Ordnance factory there as a nucleus, and could go aheadfast. The site is close to a motorway under construction and to a main railway line to be electrified, and it presents no physical difficulties. Butthere are strong agricultural and industrial objections to the site.   It would
W* be necessary to build on some 3,000 acres of good and well-managedagricultural land. The town would inevitably attract labour from thePotteries and other established industries in North Staffordshire, and inparticular from the North Staffordshire coalfield, thereby endangering theNational Coal Board&apos;s substantial investments in the area.(b) DawleyDawley is a derelict site of old mine-workings, and a new town therewould be rehabilitating an unsightly area. There are no agricultural objectionsto the site and considerably less industrial objections than to Swynnerton.On the other hand, treatment of spoil-heaps would add to the cost and special structural precautions would be needed because of old mine-workingsand because the load-bearing capacity of the spoil-heaps would be low.Moreover, additional investment in road and perhaps rail communicationswould be needed.9. The general view of the Committee is that Dawley would, on balance,provide the more suitable site for a new town and that planning should proceed onthe basis of a&apos;new town at Dawley. The Minister of Housing has commissioned a detailed investigation of the site and by the end of this year we should have an authoritative assessment of whether the special difficulties can be overcome. Ifit shows that a new town at Dawley is not practicable, we may have to reconsiderSwynnerton.10. The Financial Secretary has reserved the Chancellor of the Exchequersposition both on the site and on whether a new town for Birmingham should be built at all.Conclusion11.  I invite my colleagues (a) To authorise the Minister of Housing to approve the building of houses for Birmingham on 600 aores at Wythall: and to urge the localauthorities concerned to proceed as rapidly as possible with expansionsat Redditch, Worcester and Daventry.ib) To agree in principle to the establishment of a new town at Dawley.M.Office of the Paymaster-General, S.W. 1.27th July, 1961.
