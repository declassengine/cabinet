(61) 11221st July, 1961CABINETSURCHARGE ON EMPLOYERSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The Case for Using the Employers&apos; SurchargeIf more fiscal action is needed, one of the candidates for consideration is thenew employers&apos; surcharge, for which powers were conferred under the finance act, 1961. At the full rate without any exemptions or reduced rates, the yieldwould be  200 millions in a full year, net of the liability of the Exchequer in respectof the Governments own employees. It would therefore, initially at any rate,withdraw purchasing power of this amount from the economy. As, however, the surchange would be deductible for income tax and profits tax, about half of thiswould eventually be returned in the form of reduced tax liability. The surchargewould be an addition to the cost of employment for all employers. It would thereforefall relatively more heavily on labour-intensive industries and trades. It is not,however, intended primarily as an incentive to economy in the use of labour, butas a means of influencing the general level of demand. Even at the full rate, itwould only add 1 - 3 per cent, to the cost of employing a man receiving the average rate of industrial earnings ( 15 a week); its average effect on costs over the wholeeconomy could hardly be more than 1 per cent. It would fall about equally onproducers of goods and producers of services, since about half the employed labour force is in service trades. It would be of wide and general application, but thinlyspread; it is difficult to believe that it could in any instance be an intolerable extraimposition.2.   The disadvantages of the surcharge are:(a) It is incapable of being selective.(b) As the addition to costs would be slight and the surcharge would be ofgeneral application, it seems unlikely that it would need to be much ofa disincentive to employment in areas of high unemployment, but itmight have considerable psychological effects, and might be used asan excuse by employers for not setting up in those areas or for reducing their labour force.(c) It would bear relatively more hardly on employers of part-time workers and on employers of domestic labour; this is a political rather than a real disadvantage.id) It would be repugnant to many of our supporters as well as to our opponents(though not necessarily more so than some of the other possible types of action).3.   The advantages are:id) The powers are available on the Statute Book.ib) There is now considerable expectation that, having taken the powers, Ishall want to use them. If I do not use these powers now, it will be widely assumed that I have tacitly accepted the suggestions that theyare not usable.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.

(c) The machinery for levying the surcharge is available, and easy to use,though it would take three months to bring into operation.(d) Although it would be an addition to industrial costs, it would not be aserious one.II. A Rebate for Exporters? .........  -4. One of the main objections to the employers&apos; surcharge has been that,in-so far as it increases costs, it increases export costs and thus makes our positionless competitive. We have at present no powers to allows any rebate in respectof exporters, but I have been considering whether I could or should announce that, if the employers&apos; surcharge were to be imposed from the first Monday ofNovember, we would, when Parliament reassembled, introduce legislation enablingus to repay to exporters a proportion (equivalent to the proportion of their totalsales exported) of the employers&apos; surcharge they would have to pay.5. The immediate exporter may be one of two people: he may be a merchant,who merely buys to sell on, and does not make anything himself; or he may be amanufacturer who does his own exporting. The products of many smallmanufacturers, and many semi-finished products (e.g., textile piece-goods) areexported mainly by merchants. The merchants&apos; labour costs are trifling, and arebate which was confined to the merchant and was not available to those whosemanufactures he was exporting would be negligible in value and ludicrous ineffect. Even an exporting manufacturer is likely to include in his product manycomponents which he does not make himself, and his own labour costs may thus be comparatively slight.6. This is perhaps best illustrated by an example. The motor carmanufacturers estimate that their direct labour costs on an average car amount to 30. On the assumption that labour costs are on the average about  1,000 perworker, the increase in the  30 which would result from the imposition of theemployers&apos; surcharge at the full rate would be 6s. per car. But, of course, the direct labour costs of the motor manufacturers themselves are very much less than thelabour costs of the car as a whole when the labour involved in the raw materials and components is brought into account. I do not know what the estimate of thiswould be, but putting it at  400 for the average car selling net of purchase tax at 750, the effect of the employers&apos; surcharge would be to increase its cost ofproduction by  4.7. It is obviously out of the question to trace through the whole complexoperation of production, the labour cost of every component, even of every majorcomponent, of an elaborate finished article like a motor car, still less to tracethrough one single item within labour costs (as the surcharge would be). It is notpossible to conceive a workable scheme for providing a rebate of surcharge to all those whose products are included in such an article.. 8. On the other hand, to confine the rebate to the actual final exporter wouldbe manifestly absurd in the case of goods exported by a merchant; and in the caseof the exporting manufacturer, it would often have a negligible effect on the finalcost and be indefensibly inequitable in its result, leading to protests and demands from all manufacturers of raw materials and components for the rebate to beextended to them, and no doubt also to demands from other industries and services(for example, banks, insurance companies, even farmers) who could claim that theywere saving imports, were essential to the national economy or had some otherground for special consideration.9. There is the further point that, once the principle of giving rebates hadbeen admitted, we should be under irresistible pressure to extend the system to employers in Scotland and other areas of high unemployment.10. The difficulties about such a rebate are in fact precisely the same as thedifficulties about devising any scheme which would provide for the equivalent ofan export draw-back in respect of indirect taxes which enter into the costs ofproduction at all stages of manufacture. It is primarily for these reasons (as wellas the very serious administrative complications involved) that we have never beenable to devise a scheme for giving to exporters a draw-back equivalent to theincreased costs of manufacture resulting from the oil duties.
^ 11. In sum, anything that would be workable would be negligible in value and thoroughly inequitable in incidence and result; hut anything that came near to being equitable would.be a practicable impossibility. I have therefore concluded that we could not hold out any prospect of rebates for exporters.III. Dates and Rates12.  The surcharge could not now be imposed before 6th November.13.   It would be necessary to decide whether to impose it at the maximum(4s. a week), or at half rate (2s. a week).  In my view, if we impose the surcharge,,,we should go for the full rate to get maximum effect; I do not believe that thatwould add much to the political difficulty.14.   It would also be necessary to decide whether to charge reduced rates forany descriptions of persons:(a) We have been under strong pressure to exempt boys and girls under 18,and the Minister of Labour is keen that we should do so, in order notto discourage employment of young people (particularly apprentices).The loss of revenue would be  16 million. i should be prepared toaccept this.(b) There is a case for levying the surcharge at a lower rate for women than for men. At a time of intense pressure of demand for labour, it wouldbe consistent with the aim of getting as many women as possible intoemployment. As against this the loss of revenue would be  36 millions,and the reduction could be interpreted as a discrimination in favour ofindustries in which female labour predominates (not necessarily themost important or deserving industries). But a lower rate for women would go a long way to meeting political difficulties in respect ofpart-time workers and domestic employees. On balance I would propose to levy the surcharge at half rate (2s. a week) for all women.(c) There would be pressure to exempt employers in respect of elderly workers.In National Insurance terms, this could only mean men over 65 retiredand re-employed, and men over 70 still in employment, and womenover 60 retired and re-employed and women over 65 still in employment.It is not possible to distinguish within these two groups. It is arguable that to have a lower rate for retired men between 65-70 than for menof the same age who have not retired would be contrary to the generalaim of encouraging the full-time employment of elderly workers whoare fit. There is also a technical difficulty that we could not charge adifferent rate for elderly women than for those married women and windows (not retired) who have opted out of the employee^ national insurance contribution. I conclude reluctantly that we should nothave special rates for the elderly.(d) I should be ready to discuss with the Minister of Transport and the Ministerof Labour the treatment of foreign-going seamen (who are an identifiable&quot; description of persons&quot; for this purpose), though I see serious objections to discriminating in their favour. But I need not troublethe rest of my colleagues with this detail.15.   The effects of these proposals are shown in the table:Men   .........WomenBoys and girls under 18Rate4s.2s.Approx.

Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,21st July, 1961.IV. Summary16. I am satisfied that we cannot offer any scheme of rebates for exporters(paragraphs 4-11); and that, if the surcharge is to be imposed, it should be imposed at the full rate for men and half rate for women, with completeexemption for boys and girls under 18.S.
