document IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENT      JPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1948 ,        1,40IeGBET Copy No.    313.P. (48) 15i January, 1948CABINETPOLITICAL ACTIVITIES OF CIVIL SERVANTSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in 1945, in pursuance of the suggestion made by my predecessor to thelord Presidents Committee, a Ministerial Committee was set up under hispirmanship to consider whether there should be any relaxations of the existinglestrictions on the political activities of civil servants.   The Committee heldnumber of meetings and were generally agreed that some of the restrictionsIbuld be relaxed. There was, however, considerable difficulty in determiningow far the relaxations might extend and last summer my predecessor came to lie conclusion that it would be difficult for a body of Ministers to give sufficientHime to the investigation of such a complex subject and that, in any event,mere was much to be said for an independent enquiry, the findings of whichpild be more likely to be acceptable to public opinion.2. I have discussed with the other members of the Ministerial Committeelie proposal that there should be an independent enquiry and we have agreedId recommend that an outside Committee should be set up with the followinggerms of reference : &quot; To examine the existing limitations on the political activities (both national and local) which may be undertaken by civilian Government, staffs and to make recommendations as to any changes which may be desirable in the public interest.&quot;ie Staff Side of the Civil Service National Whitley Council, and more particu-fcrly the Post Office staffs, are pressing for some alteration in the present rules,pud it seems desirable that the proposed Committee should be appointed as soonI possible.3. If the proposal to appoint an outside Committee is approved by the[Cabinet, I will discuss the membership of the Committee with the Prime Minister.R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.
