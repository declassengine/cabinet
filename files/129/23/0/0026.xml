V   193[HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (2+8)  262QTH JANUARY.  lQa8CABINETSHIPBRSAKING AND OTHER COMMERCIAL WORKIN THE ROYAL DOCKYARDSMemorandum by the First Lord of the AdmiraltvIn the light of points raised at the meeting of theCabinet on 15th December (C.M. (2+7) 95th Conclusions, Minute 3)and of the Defence Committee on 19th December (D.0.(1+7) 27thMeeting, Minute l) I have arranged with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Supply to submit a report onthe possibilities of carrying out ship breaking and ethercommercial work in the Royal Dockyards.Commercial work other than shipbre akin,? in Revel Dockyards2. H.M. Dockyards exist primarily for the purpose of constructing, maintaining and repairing the ships of theRoyal Navy and its auxiliaries.      Their equipment was chosenand their lay-out designed to undertake this work in the most economical manner.      Their first task must always be to ensurethat the efficiency of the Royal Navy is maintained.     Thereis in fact enough essential work, outstanding in connectionwith the maintenance of the active Fleet alone te employ thewhole resources of the Dockyards.3a For the financial year 19*4 6/2+7, however,  the moniesavailable for the maintenance of the Fleet were not enough toprovide full employment for the whole of the Dockyard labour force on Naval work.      Therefore,  other work was obtained toprovide employment for an average over the year of some 2,300men who would otherwise have had te be discharged.     This work has been carried on into 192+7/2+8.2+e The Dockyards are not laid out for general engineeringproduction.     Large orders for work of factory type-: would tendto upset the balance of trades and would interfere with the mainship work of the Yards.     .Thc Dockyards arc not in any casecapable of economical &quot;line production&quot; without a costly re-planning of shops and special tooling-up which would alter thecharacter of the Yards&apos; and prejudice the performance of their proper function.     Approximately half the employees of the Yardswork afloat and workshop space ashore is limited.-50 Because,   therefore, the Dockyards are designed forship construction and repair,- the type of civilian work thatabsorbs shipyard trades in the best- proportions, and is best suited to the Dockyards&apos; economy, is other ship work,copy NO.   3*2
The policy pursued has accordingly been to scclc the maximumemount of ship work: though, as-will be seen from the following paragraph, repayment work has not boon limited to this category.6* Examples of non-naval ship work which have boon under-taken or arc duo to be undertaken during the year 19U7/U8, inaddition to refits, end repair of Admiralty auxiliaries,  cro:-(a) Refits and reconstructions of ships for the AirMinistry, War Office, Ministry of Transport, General Post Officeand other Government Departments;(b) Extensive repairs to several damaged Merchant ships,including American and Norwegian owned vessels,     (One suchcontract involved building half a ship);-   (c)    Refits of warships loaned or disposed of to dominion and Foreign Governments,In addition, within the limitations described in paragraph kabove, a great deal of other repayment work of a fairly wide variety has also been undertaken.     Examples are:-(a) Fabrication of the steel structure for the AtomicPile at Harwell, for the Ministry of Supply;(b) Construction of a new wind tunnel for the NationalPhysical Laboratory;(c) Conversion of locomotive tenders from coal to oil;(d) Miscellaneous work for municipal authorities inconnection with housing programmes, for the General Post Officeand for other bodies;(e) Miscellaneous foundry, machine shop and other work,as capacity is available,7* The only instance in which more commercial work might now be undertaken is in respect of tasks which v/ould employelectrical wire-men,  as ship work outside warship work docsnot provide the some amount of waring work as that required inwarships.      The possibility of finding additional commercialwork for these mon is being examined,8. It is not likely that there will be difficulty inI9U8/I49 in filling with commercial work any capacity which may prove to be available when the amount of money to be availablefor the Dockyards&quot; proper work of maintaining the Fleet isknown.     Work already in hand which will be carried over intoI9I+8/I49 end enquiries so far received for now work cover thefollowing possibilities:-(a) Refits of vessels for War Office, Air Ministry andGeneral Post Office;(b) Alterations to a number of T.2 Class Tankers;-(c) Completion of refit of the Cruiser ACHILLES, and new work on three destroyers, for the Government of India;(d) Conversion to surveying ship of a frigate and workon six other frigates for New Zaalond;
(e) Completion of alterations and refit of the aircraft-carrier VENERABLE for the Dutch;(f) Refit cf a frigate under offer to VenezuelanGovernment;(g) Building of a new fore end for the damaged commercialtanker NEWKALL HILLS;(h) Fabricated steel work for the new Atomic Pile inCumberland, for Ministry of Supply;(j)    An additional larae wind tunnel for National PhysicalLaboratory;(k)    Production of component parts for railway wagons;(l)    A continuation of miscellano.us work for general post Office and other Government and municipal authorities andfor private firms,  as capacity becomes available.9. It is not yet known how many of the above items mightmature, but apart from the question whether capacity would beavailable for them all,  so tuany orders might well call for more steel,  especially in the case of new construction,  than could be allocated.      It is, however, clear at the present time that there is sufficient work in prospect to utilise during thonext financial year the expected available capacity at the dockyards.     Whether this capacity will.bo on a scale similarto or greater than that of 192+7/h8 depends on factor not yetdetermined, namely,  the extent to which, within the limitedtotal sum available for the Navy in 19h8/h9, funds can be madeavailable for work on H.M.  Ships.     -Subject to this uncertainfactor,  to the availability of materials and to my remarks aboveabout the employment of electrical wire-men,  it ia safe to saythat- capacity for commercial work will continue to be available from time to time during 19h 8/^.9*Shipbrcaking in Royal Dockyards10. This question has been the subject of very careful investigation, and it is clear that the Royal Dockyards both at home and abroad havo little capacity for ohipbrcaking aftermeeting Naval requirements and dealing with other commitments on commercial work.11. One main trouble in the Royal Dockyards at home isthat shipbrcaking would involve the uneconomical use of berthsand docks,  since&quot;there arc no beaches near the Yards that couldbe used for this purpose.      Further, in all Yards there is alack of space where large masses of scrap could be dumped forbreaking down and sorting.      The inadequacy of rail facilities to clear scrap and at the same- time meet Naval requirements is also an important factor.12. At- Yards abroad,  particularly Malta, owing to thesmall tidal rise- and fall,  shipbroaking could only bo undertaken with the ships accommodated in dry docks, equipped with goodlifting appliances one  transport facilities.      If docks wereallocated at the expense of ship repair work,  it would be impracticable to avoid considerable dislocation of shipactivities elsewhere in the Dockyards affected.13. &apos; Shipbroaking employs only a limited number of grades of shipyard labour, mainly burners,  caulkers,  slingers and
general labourers;    little,  if any, work is provided formechanics.     The grades suitable for shipbrca king arc notavailable in the &quot;Royal Dockyards in sufficient numbers toundertake the work on any scale, and their employment in thisway would create a lack of balance which might prejudice theemployment of other grades.14. The removal of expert labour from the shipbrcokingindustry to organise and supervise -shipbrcaking in the royal dockyards would not necessarily increase shipbreeking capacity,since it would hamper the operations of the- industry itself.15. . The conclusion reached is that the Royal Dockyardsarc- not suitably laid out and organised for ohipbrocking, andthat acceptance of this work would bo uneconomical, apartfrom displacing other important Naval and commercial tasks.H.1Admiralty, S.W.  1.,29th January, 1948.
