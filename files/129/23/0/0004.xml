It   is  issued   for   theCP. (48) 4 &quot;       personal use of.CogY No.   31CABINETGYRENAICAMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR war at their meeting (381.11/47) on 22nd April, 1947, the Cabinet considered a memorandumby the Secretary of State for War (CP. (47)126) reporting progress in implementing therecommendations of the Working Party which visited the territory last winter. Such of these recommendations as are administrative or material in character are being put into effect as quickly as limitations of material and personnel will allow, and are having a beneficial effect upon relations between the Administration and the local inhabitants. The Emir, Sayid Idris,has returned to Cyrenaica to take up his permanent residence in the territory after his long period of exile in Egypt, and all the necessary preliminary steps have been taken towards theestablishment of an Advisory Council which will act within the framework of the present administration and upon which the local inhabitants will be suitably represented.2. The return of the Emir and the establishment of an Advisory Council, together withthe more material projects to which reference has been made above, will go far towardsimproving our relations with Cyrenaica but, if these improved relations are to be maintained,further action of a positive nature will soon be required. Severe disappointment was felt inthe territory when it was announced in the summer of 1946 that the decision as to its futurewas to be postponed for a year. More than a year has already elapsed since that date and,although it is hoped that the Council of Foreign Ministers will arrive at a decision by september, 1948, such an outcome is not certain and nothing is likely to do more towardsembittering relations than an indefinite prolongation of the period of standstill. During sucha period, not only do the local inhabitants suffer frustration, but the way is made easy forthe propaganda of other interested parties (for example Egypt and the Arab League), greatly to the detriment of our position.3. Whatever the final decision as to the future of Cyrenaica is to be (whether it is to beplaced under British Trusteeship or granted independence), a completely new administrative structure will have to be introduced, and it will have to be granted what will, in effect, be anew constitution. Although there will presumably be no question of our imposing a newconstitution upon Cyrenaica, it is quite clear that the Cyrenaicans are in no position toevolve one for themselves without considerable advice and assistance, and it is most desirablethat the initiative in this respect should rest in our hands. Much work will be required andmany problems will have to be solved before a new regime can be established on a viablebasis, and, if a decision is likely to be arrived at within the next twelve months, it appearsessential that action should be put in hand now. Even if the Council of Foreign Ministersfail to reach agreement and the matter has to be referred to the Assembly of the united nations, the local inhabitants will require tangible proof that progress is being made towardsthe eventual establishment of an autonomous Cyrenaica, if our present good relationship isnot to be irretrievably damaged.4. The work involved will be of a highly technical character and will include: (a) The formulation of a new constitution.(b) A complete revision of the existing machinery of administration, involving a basicre-organisation upon an Arabic, as opposed to an English, basis.(c) The drawing up of new legal codes.(( ) Formulation of a new financial policy in accordance with the Territory&apos;s new status.(e) Provision of staff in the light of (6) above. Arabization of the administration should make easier the employment of more Cyrenaicans, but. will at the sametime make the provision of such British Advisers as are considered necessary moredifficult.
This task is one which the War Office is not fully qualified to undertake and steps arebeing taken in consultation with the -other Departments concerned to set up a suitablemachinery which will be responsible for forward planning and for considering the many problems which will have to be solved before a new regime could be established. In additionto the work to be done in London, much new constructive work and forward planning willhave to be undertaken in Cyrenaica, where the Emir and the leading inhabitants will haveto be consulted and where local aspirations will have to be given due weight in recommendingfuture policy. Much of this work will be beyond the capacity of certain members of thepresent Administration, however well they may have carried out their duties under a policyof care and maintenance, and there will be an early need for a number of suitably qualifiedBritish officials, all of whom should be Arabic speaking with previous experience in arab countries. The results of their work will affect the Foreign Office if Cyrenaica becomesindependent; whilst if Cyrenaica is placed under United Kingdom trusteeship, whether ornot the Colonial Office were to become the Department primarily responsible for theadministration of the territory, they will obviously be closely concerned. I shall hopetherefore to have the active co-operation of the Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs andthe Colonies.5. The lines of planning recommended in paragraph 4 represent a marked development inour relations with Cyrenaica, and I ask my colleagues to take note of this paper and to giveapproval in principle for the adoption of this line of approach.E. S.The War Office,$fh January, 1948.(e47/45)  95   iA*8   w.o.p.   88960
