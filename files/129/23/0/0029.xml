215ITHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)SECRET -C.P.(U8)  29 COPY NO.     ^ft25RD JANUARY,  19U-S.CABINETPOTATO SUP&quot; LIESMemorandum by the Minister of FoodIt is now clear that it will be impossible tc maintainthe allocation of potatoes at its present scale of 3 lbs.a week during&apos; the rest of this crop year.      As soon as p.detailed analysis has been made on the January census ofpotato stocks I will submit a recommendation as to thedate and the extent to which the allocation will have tobe lowered.      I should be in a position tc make thisrecominendati on in about two weeks &apos;   time.2.      In the meanwhile,  however,  I must place the question ofthe acreage of potatoes to bo grown next year before mycolleagues as a matter of urgency.      The target acreage of1,U23,600 acres which has been announced by the Minister ofAgriculture will not, even if it is fully achieved,  enable us to go through the next potato year without re-imposingpotato rationing unless we have an abnormally high yield.I believe that the re-imposition of potato rationing nextyear would be so grave a matter that drastic steps to avert such a risk will be fully justified.      Indeed, I donot see how we can defend before Parliament and the country a failure to take such steps today.     What could we say ifwe could be justly accused of planning a potato acreage which,oh a normal yield.,  could not produce us sufficient potatoesto avert rationing next year?3.    The following two tables show the supply of potatoeswhich w^uld be available for. human consumption (after allowing for seed, wastage,  etc.) from (A) 1,U23,000 acresat various yields,  assuming on equivalent acreage in 19U9,and (B) from 1,500,000 acres at various yields,  also assumingan equivalent acreage in 19U9:-(A)    On the basis of 1,U23,000 acres.Yields per Total available supply in       Surplus oracre Great Britain from the Deficit (-)(tons)       United kingdom-m crop (000 tons)	(exclusive	(000 t6.0	U,7926.5	5,3607.0	5,9287.3	6,2687-5	6,U957-7	6,722-ist &quot;	1,503&quot;f-&apos;	935	367	27	200U:	I      U27-1-

(The actual amountconsumed in 1946-7 was 6,096,000 tons, but there were seriousshortages in the first half of 1947.)4.      It will therefore be seen that the present target acreageof 1,423,000 will only suffice if a yield of 7.3 per acre is&apos;&quot;realised.      But the national average yield over the last tenyears (1938-47) is only 6.98.      In fact a yield of 7.3 or above has only been obtained three times since ISO5.     Dowe not lay ourselves open to a charge of culpable negligenceif we gamble on attaining s3 abnormally high a yield in orderto obtain sufficient supplies for the coming year?5.      Even on the basis of 1,500,000 acres, a yield of seventons to the acre is necessary in order to balance the accounts.(The small deficit of 34,000 tons can be set against possibleimports of, say, 115,000 tons, giving uo a small workingsurplus such as will be,  in all the circumstances,  highly desirable.)6.      I therefore suggest that the Minister of Agriculture beinvited ti raise the target acreage tr he planted this year.My Department&apos;s original estimate of the required acreage was1,600,000 acres,  and I should still have much preferred to aim at this acreage in order to give us a margin of safety.I accept, however,   the Minister of Agriculture&apos;s statement that it is in practice impossible to obtain such an acreagethis year.-     I suggest,  therefore, as a c rnpromise that the target should be raised to 1,500,000 acres,  though even thiswill leave us seriously short if the crop falls much below theten years&apos;  average which.,  of course, could well happen.7.      In order to attain an acreage of 1,-00,000 it willunquestionably be necessary to take drastic steps without delay.I now learn with the utmost&apos; concern that in spite of therepeated assurances of the Ministry of Agriculture that weshould achieve the target acreage and the- yield we require-without any need for further measures,   the National Farmers&apos;Union has just told the Ministry of Agriculture that the target of 1,423,000 acres will not be reached unless greaterinducements are offered to farmers.      It is    of course,   for theMinister of Agriculture to propose what steps should be taken,but I suggest that he be invited to consider (a)  an increaseof  .1 in &quot;the tonnage price and (b) extending the . 12 per acreacreage payment to all acreage grown.      In the changed circumstances I strongly prefer ( a) as being more liStcly toproduce the potatoes, we need.     Moreover,  the extra cost- wouldbe passed to the consumer whereas an increase in the acreagepayment would be payable by the Treasury.
2178.      I an loath indeed to suggest a further large cash payment to farmers - who appear to me to be by no means the most fortunate members of the community today,  to say the least of it.      But I see no other way of preventing the disaster of another potato famine next year.      And I am quite&quot; sure thatthe consumers faced with a choice of having to pay V9d.  a lb.more for potatoes (the cost to the consumer of . 1 a ten extrato the farmers)  and having another year of potato rationing?would choose the increase in price.9.      The truth is that we have decided to pay the farmers somuch too much (as I now think) for growing cereals and other alternative ctraps that we have made potatoes almost the leasteligible crop- - although we may well need potatoes the most,if our supply of imported foods becomes still more difficultnext year.     Logically the better way of making potato-growingmore attractive would he to decrease the prices paid for theother crops instead of increasing the price of potatoes.      Butthis is now impracticable.10.      However,  it does appear to me that the Minister ofAgriculture should be willing to support the most generousinducement of  1 a t-n increase in price by issuing specificdirections to farmers to grow potatoes wherever a county would otherwise fall short of its target.      I therefore submit thatthe Minister of Agriculture should be invited to announce thenew target and the above measure designed to ensure that itshr,uId be attained.11.

A I&apos; ? E N D I XAvailability of rotate Survlies in Great britain.      The reference in the Memorandum to available supplies at various yields presupposes 1%S acreages of (a) 1,U23&quot;,000 acres,and (b) 1,500,000 acres in the United Kingdom;    of which(a) 190,000 and (b)  210,000 are assumed to be grown inNorthern Ireland.      The figures relate to availability inGreat Britain for human consumption from the. United Kingdomcrop, and do not include any imparts.     Quantities moved from Northern Ireland to Great Britain are calculated inaccordance with yield variations on a formula basis,  and inthe case of (a)  are 16-3,000 tons and (b) 189,000 tons.Estimated human consumption requirements in Great Britain are based on post-bread rationing levels.2.      Additional acreage in Northern Ireland is useful only tothe extent that shipments to Great Britain can be increased.In 191+6/1+7 the total shipments to Great Britain were 211,000 tons for human consumption.      In no previous year had the shipmentsfor human consumption purposes reached 200,000 tens,  except in1935/36, -when they were about 230,000.      The factors operatingto offset the value of increase! acreage in Northern Ireland are:-(a) A heavy disappearance on farms through waste andusage for stock feeding,  etc., which,  on a ten yearsaverage,  represents 38/-.-. of production.(b) Difficulty of marketing Northern Ireland potatoesin Great Britain in the early months of the seasonwhen local supplies are filling the markets.(c) Limitation of port and shipping facilities duringthe remainder of the season.In view of these factors,  it is unsafe to calculatesupplies and utilisation on a United Kingdom basis.3.      In producing figures of available supplies in Great Britain,allowance is made from the production figures for the followingcomponents:-(a) Seed for farms in Great Britain(b) Seed &quot;for allotments(c) Seed for export(d) VJare for export(e) \7are. for processing(f) Stock feed,  and(g) A residual consisting of chats and wastage and otherdisappearance,  such as stock feeding on farms.Components (c)  and (d) are taken at the minimum tonnage as estimated for this season (20,000 tons):    (e) is tonnag-erequired, for priority purposes, 30,000;    (f)  relates todisposals of the deteriorating stocks, by the Ministry for stock feed i+0,000;    and (g) is assumed at the ten year average figure, which represents- 17-gv&quot; of production.-k-
219Human G ons umpti on .      In the twelve months July 19h7 to June 19U7*  the total volume of human consumption in the United Kingdom of supplies from home and abroad was 6,436,000 tons,  of which 340,000 tons were consumed in northern Ireland.      Great Britain&apos;s consumption was,  therefore, 6,096,000 tons, which was lh% greater than in19h5/6.      This figure would have been greater if the fullimpact of bread rationing at the beginning of the period hadbeen felt,  and if further supplies had been available inFebruary/March and at the end of the season,  to meet the gapcaused by the frost and flood damage and general insufficiencyof supplies.(fn .the .nreceding twelve months .,July 19U5 tc dune A9k6., ,the  *3 onsuklo ti on in Ore at Britain frora all s.-&quot;urces was 3,346,000&apos;tons.)6.      The estimated human consumption requirement for 1948/9 inGreat Britain of 6,295,000 t-ns is log. above the 1945/6 figure.Average Yields7.      Average yields per acre in the United Kingdom since 1923have been as follows:-Year	Tons	10 yo	ar		(!
