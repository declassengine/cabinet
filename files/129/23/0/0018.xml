HijfjUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY  OF  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1948pCEET Copy No.   iIP. (48) 18ih January, 1948CABINETEAST AFRICAN GROUNDNUT scheme memorandum by the Minister of food ATTACH a copy of a draft White Paper on the East African GroundnutScheme, which I am under obligation to submit to Parliament.; 2. It will be seen that it did not prove possible to begin large-scale clearingiperations in Tanganyika in time to sow for the 1948 harvest a large enoughirop to be an appreciable factor in our 1948 supply of oils and fats. OriginallyI was hoped, to clear 150,000 acres in 1947. In order to do this it was calculatedihat clearing operations would have to begin in February. In fact it wasmpossible to obtain the necessary heavy tractors and other equipment to transporthem to Central Tanganyika and to get them working on an appreciable scalelefore July. This delay in starting operations plus the initial difficulties ofinding the best technical methods of clearing the bush, and the problems of main-maintenance of the army surplus heavy tractors which have had to be used, has mean that not more than some 10,000 acres will be cleared and planted for this year&apos;srop. This acreage is quite sufficient to serve as a large-scale experiment, butlot sufficient to give us appreciable quantities of oils and fats. Therefore thecheme, as a large-scale commercial producer for the market, will, in fact, onlyegin its operations in 1948, and will reap its first commercially disposable harvestu the spring of 1949.3. Nevertheless, the decision taken by the Cabinet just a year ago (CM. (47)th Conclusions, Minute 3) to start operations in 1947, before the Overseas food corporation could be set up, and thus involving the employment of the Unitedifnca Company as managing agents, has, I believe, been fully justified,^though only the above comparatively small acreage has been cleared, an immensemount of indispensible preliminary work by way of establishing camps, extendingairways, setting- up workshops, recruiting labour, &amp;c, has been done, and valuable experience gained. If 1947 had not been used for these purposes, thisreliminary work would have had to be done in 1948 and the obtaining of a large-cale crop would, in my opinion, have been postponed till the spring of 1950. Themnaging agents encountered great initial difficulties in securing tractors, ineeping them under repair, in meeting the novel engineering problems of flatteninghe African bush by mechanical means and of eradicating the roots. It was, ofQurse, always envisaged that such problems, the exact nature of which could onlye ascertained by practice, would be encountered. Many of these technicaliroblems are now on the way to solution. And the Government, I am convinced,wes a debt, of gratitude to the United Africa Company, as managing agents, forfle courageous pioneering work which they have carried out on the scheme inIn no other way than by the appointment of a large scale existing organi-ation, such as the United African Company, could we have made within the first^elve months of our initial decision to proceed, the substantial start on the scheme?hich has in fact been made during the past year.34802 b
Future Prospects of the scheme. Soon after the Colonial Resources Development Bill which is now gointhrough Parliament has become law, a vesting day will be named and the OverseaFood Corporation will take over the responsibility for the management of thscheme. No doubt the United Africa Company will, for some months, continuto do work on the scheme as one of the Corporation^ sub-contractors. Severother well-known firms, such as Messrs. Mowlems, Balfour Beattie and Paulingare already at work on the scheme as contractors.Financial Prospects of the Scheme5. I call my colleagues&apos; attention to paragraph 24 of the draft report, whicljreads in part :-&quot; Until larger acreages with different types of vegetation have beerflcleared and the first unit installations completed, and a full year&apos;s agriculturaloperations carried out on at least one unit, it will not be possible to make anjdependable revision of the estimated costs of production as set out iiqparagraphs 19-24 of Command 7030. On the one hand the prices of the mechanical equipment and stores of all kinds necessary for the scheme aresteadily rising, and in addition a larger expenditure than had been antici]pated will be necessary upon, in particular, the transport services and thdrepair organisation. On the other, the world price of oils and fats is alsorising and now seems only too likely to remain at a high level for a mudlonger period than was envisaged a year ago&quot; These two developments, which are merely what was to be expected iithe case of a scheme being carried out in conditions of rising prices on world-wide scale, will, of course, affect the scheme in opposite directions. the rising costs will adversely affect it, the rising prices of its product will tend tcmake it more profitable. It would be quite unrealistic to pretend that anjbalance between these opposite tendencies can at present be struck.&quot;6.   I am convinced that any figures that would be published to-day relatingeither to the probable costs of the scheme in future years or the probable revenue to be derived from it would almost certainly be falsified in the event.  This isjfirst because the world prices of both the equipment which the Corporation must]purchase and the products which it will sell, are both rapidly rising, and also!of course, because experience of the scheme&apos;s workings will certainly lead to!revisions in the capital expenditure and operating costs.   It would, therefore, bejmisleading to attempt to revise the original Command Paper estimates until wehave experience of at least one year of commercial working and the first crop has been sold commercially in the spring of 1949.7. Nevertheless, my Department has carefully studied such evidence as is available of the way in which the costs of the scheme are going, and of its probable!revenue earning capacity. As the scheme is being conducted in a period of!rapidly rising world prices, the result of this preliminary examination has, offcourse, been to show that both the anticipated costs and the anticipated revenues!of the scheme are likely to be substantially higher than was estimated a year ago.1And in addition certain of the costs of development, in particular the amount ofimoney needed to provide adequate transport and administrative services were!under-estimated.8. The present position, according to information furnished by the managing!agents, with the concurrence of the members-designate of the Board of the!Overseas Food Corporation, is that if no further changes in the prices of thefgoods and services which the Corporation will have to buy take place, the capital!costs of the scheme will have risen by some  5,700,000, and the annual operating costs by some.  1,600,000.9.   These increases in costs would be most serious to the scheme were they notoffset by at least comparable increases in the prices of the products which the!Corporation will have to sell.  The main product of the Corporation is, of course,!groundnuts.  At the inception of the scheme it was originally estimated that tne-priee of groundnuts would be  30 a ton up till August, T95Q, and thereafter  20a ton. My Oils and Fats Division are now convinced that (unfortunately from a wider point of view) groundnut prices are now likely to be considerably higher!than this, and they have made the following estimate, which they emphasise is ofl
most tentative character, of the probable prices which groundnuts may be$ted to realise :-	Per	ton	 	s.1948   ...............	......         35	01949   ...............	35	01950   ...............	......         35	01951   ...       ............	32	101952   ...............	30	01953   ...............	......        27	101954  ...............	25	01955   ...      ,..       ...      ......	......         22	101956 and thereafter ...	......         20	0An increase of  5 per ton in the price realised for the product would increasebe revenue of the Corporation by &amp;2\ million per annum, when the full estimatednnnal production of groundnuts was being realised.10. It is interesting also to compare the above estimate of probable futureiroundnut prices with the prices which we are at present forced to give forimparable products. For an exactly similar product from India we are paying!50 a ton and for groundnut oil from the Argentine we pay the equivalent ofrer  70 a ton for the nuts. It will be seen, therefore, that the estimate thatroundnut prices will come down to  20 a ton in 8 years&apos; time is, possibly, anptimistic one on the part of my Ministry or, to make the same point from theiposite point of view, is a most conservative estimate from the point of view the prospects of the profitability of the Overseas Food Corporation.11. It may, of course, be argued that the production of the appreciablethough not enormous in relation to total world production) supplies of groundnutsontemplated in East Africa will itself help to bring down the price of ground&apos;.uts, at any rate towards  20 a ton over the next eight years.  From a national joint of view, such a result is, of course, devoutly to be hoped for. It would,owever, limit the profitability of the Groundnuts Scheme. In fact it is possibleoshow that if the price of groundnuts dropped to  20 a ton and the operatingbsts of the Corporation did not drop at all a most unlikely hypothesis theCorporation would not be able to repay in full the Treasury advance in the3 years of its present lease of land However, the Corporation already has anption to extend this period and even on the above assumption that prices ofts product will nearly fall to half, but that its costs will not fall at all, theCorporation would still be able slowly to repay its Treasury advance. Moreover,he possible almost halving in the world price of an important primary product,ach as oils and fats, would greatly assist us in our balance of payments problems,his is surely an instance of where wider considerations must be applied inmessing the prospects and worthwhileness of a public enterprise than woulde appropriate in the case of an enterprise carried on for private profit. Anyuch possible prospect of the near halving of the price of groundnuts would be,rom the point of view of a purely private profit-making enterprise, a menacefhich might deter its promoters from undertaking the scheme, But from thewint of view of a public enterprise the possibility that the scheme will havehis tendency should be regarded as one of its greatest advantages, even though! would have an adverse effect on its balance sheet,I 12. It will be seen from the above that if the price of groundnuts merelyalls more slowly than was estimated over the next decade, which is only toofobable, the resultant increase in revenue will fully compensate the corporation or the increased costs in capital outlay and operations which it will probablylave to face.13. Three other factors have appeared which may also substantially improvehe revenue-earning capacity of the Groundnuts Scheme : (i) The yield per acre of the scheme was estimated at 750 lb. an acre. Itis now thought that this estimate may have been a highly conservativeone. For example, the trial plots of groundnuts which were sown In Tanganyika over a fairly wide area have shown an average yield of900 lb. per acre. This would be insufficient evidence to justify a specific revision of the estimated yield per acre, but it is interesting to notice that, if an average yield of even 850 lb. per acre was achieved,this would give an additional annual revenue, at a price of  30 a.ton, ;of  2 million per annum when full production had been reached.34802 b 2
(ii) The trial plots have now been re-sown with various cereal crops which 1it is now thought can, with advantage, be grown upon the cleared Iarea when, as contemplated in the original scheme, the soil has to be Irested from groundnuts. Should it prove possible, as now seems to be Ithe case, to grow regular crops of cereals on these areas, substantial!additional revenue would, of course, accrue to the Corporation,(iii) Estimates have now been made of the value of the timber standing on!the areas to be cleared under the scheme. The Department of the IConservators of Forests for Tanganyika have made an estimate that!the gross value of the timber, mainly hardwood and mahogany, in one!third of the area to be cleared in the Southern Province is  6 million.!If, as is believed, the remaining areas in the Southern Province and!the area in the Western Province of Tanganyika to be cleared have!similar quantities of hardwood upon them, the majority of which will Ibe cleared in any case, a considerable additional revenue may be avail-1able to the Corporation during the five-year period in which it will be]conducting clearing operations. Sawmill equipment and other equip-&quot;ment for dealing with the timber are at present being procured. These!will, of course, increase the costs of operation, but there should be a]very substantial net balance to the Corporation. This source of Jrevenue was not taken into account in the original estimates.14. I am convinced that we should deceive ourselves if we attempted to say what the net effect on the prospects of the profitability of the scheme of the abovedevelopments is likely to be in terms of its annual balance sheet. But of the new factors which have appeared since the original estimates were made, those whichhave improved the prospects of the scheme&apos;s revenues are at least as important asthose which have increased its costs.Conclusions15. When the Groundnut Scheme was first proposed to the Cabinet, Istated : &quot; My colleagues will see that this is a big enterprise; it has to be if itis to meet even a substantial part of our desperate need for fats. Mycolleagues would not believe me if I tried to pretend to them that such ascheme was free from risk. Of course, serious difficulties and delays, manyof them unforeseeable, may arise in the course of a great undertaking ofthis sort.&quot;I do not consider that the delay which has already been experienced in getting the physical work of the scheme started, and the initial difficulties met with in solving the technical problems of clearing the bush, constitute in themselvesserious setbacks, such as I had in mind a year ago. The truth is that the schemeis still at a very early stage. It has probably not yet encountered its majordifficulties and problems. But it probably will encounter these serious difficulties and problems, the overcoming of which will need all the skill and resolution ofthose conducting the scheme, and all the support we can give them. I am equallyconvinced that the scheme is one of the most significant pioneering public enter-prises which the Government has undertaken. It points the way to a new andincomparably more socially desirable method for conducting that development of primary production in Colonial and dependent territories on which their pios-perity, and our own, so largely depend. It is the application of Socialist publicenterprise in a new and potentially most fruitful field. The scheme has excitedworld-wide interest and attention, particularly in the United States of America,where it has been taken as encouraging evidence that Great Britain is at lengthdetermined to develop her hitherto latent Colonial resources. It is along the linesof this and other public schemes undertaken both by the Overseas Food Corpora-tion and by the larger Colonial Development Corporation that the urgent problemsof the people of our Colonial and dependent territories can be solved, and at thesame time our need for ample and reasonably priced primary products be met.J.

EAST AFRICAN GROUNDNUTS SCHEMEReview of Progress to the end of November, 1947Introduction1. The following report records the progress made in the first year since his Majesty&apos;s Government decided, in November, 19)46, to start work on theEast African Groundnuts Scheme as described in Command 7030. Theexecution of the initial phases of the plan has been entrusted to the UnitedAfrica Company Ltd., acting as Managing Agents for the Minister of Food,on whom His Majesty&apos;s Government decided to place the responsibility forcarrying out the programme.Selection of first site for development2. .The first question to be decided was which of the five main areasrecommended for development to choose for the first year&apos;s operations.Despite the fact that a branch railway - line and a considerable mileage of roads had to be built, the choice fell upon the Central Province of TanganyikaTerritory, primarily because of its relative accessibility the selected area tyingonly a few miles to the north of the Central Railway Line and some 240 milesby rail from the port of Dar-es-Salaam but also because it was expected that most of the land, which in this area is covered with thorn bush, would be easier to clear than the land in the other areas, where the number of sizeabletrees per acre is greater.The target for development in 19473. The aim of the first year&apos;s operations was to clear 150,000 acres ofbush for planting by the end of 1947, and at the same time to build up theorganisation required for the later expansion of the scheme. It had been calculated that in order to achieve-this the clearing equipment would haveto be on the site in February, and that 200 heavy tractor units would berequired. The first task was, therefore, to procure this equipment. Theonly source of supply for new equipment of this type is the U.S.A., and enquiries soon showed that there was no chance of obtaining more than afew new machines from that source, since the demand already exceeded thesupply from new production. It was therefore necessary to look for second-hand equipment, and this had to be picked, up almost entirely from surplusmilitary stores in many different countries. J The largest single source of supplyproved to be U.S. Army surplus machines in the Philippine Islands, butmachines were also found in the U.K., the U.S.A., the Middle East and ceylon. A Valentine tank was converted experimentally for use on clearingwork but trials proved this machine to be unsuitable for the work. All this equipment, of course, heeded re-conditioning before shipment. Orders also had to foe placed for the wide range of agricultural tractors and implementsrequired for delivery in Tanganyika later in the same year. It soon became clear that these could not be obtained in time from the &apos;U.K., and a mission was, therefore, sent to the U.S.A. to examine many different types ofmachinery in use in the pea-nut growing areas of Georgia and South Carolina.As a result of this Mission&apos;s report, and of the discovery that it would bemore than two years before manufacturers in the U.K. would be in aposition to meet the requirements of the schsme, a contract was concluded with a Canadian firm, Messrs. Massey, Harris, for the purchase of all theagricultural machinery required for the programme for the first two years.It is hoped that manufacturers in the U.K. will be able to meet at least alarge part of the needs of the scheme from then onwards.
First shipments of clearing equipment to East Africa4. Although it was clear that it would be impossible to overhaul and to ship the clearing equipment in time to arrive in the Central Province of tanganyika in February, there was reason to hope that by speeding up thepurchase and shipment of heavy tractors against the requirements for the later years, it might still prove possible to achieve during 1947 substantial progress towards the year&apos;s target. During January and February, however,the fuel crisis and the general dislocation of the transport system delayedthe reconditioning and movement to seaboard of the machines bought in the,-^united Kingdom; furthermore, the first shipment of supplies was held upV.?6r over two weeks by fogs and storms. In the event it was not until the25th February that the first 10 of the 125 heavy tractors allocated to thescheme from the U.K. were shipped. These tractors were unloaded inDar-es-Salaam at the end of March and (after a journey delayed by thebreaching of a railway embankment owing to floods) arrived at Kongwa, the site of the operations in the Central Province, on the 20th April. The sub-sequent build-up of the tractor force is described in paragraph 12.Preparatory work in Tanganyika5. Meanwhile, preliminary negotiations were started with the TanganyikaGovernment on such problems as those arising from the recruitment of staff,the need for port and railway facilities, and the terms and conditions of leases, and every effort was made to ensure that any temporary dislocation of the general economy of Tanganyika due to the rapidity of the launching of the Groundnuts Scheme should be reduced to a minimum. Trial plotsof groundnuts, which have since given satisfactory yields, were planted nearKongwa early in the year.6. The advance party of the Managing Agents, accompanied by a numberof representatives of the contractors who had been engaged for the first year&apos;sclearing operations, arrived in Dar-es-Salaam at the end of January, 1947.Their duties were, among others, to arrange for the reception, transport andservicing of equipment, plant and machinery, the establishment of the firsttemporary camp, and subsequent permanent camps near Kongwa, the survey of the first of the 30,000 acre units, the recruitment of labour and the starting of preliminary clearing and constructional operations, including the provisionof an airstrip near Kongwa&apos; and the settlement, in consultation with the Tanganyika Government, of local problems as they arose! By the end ofApril, the first few tractors and over r,ooo Africans had begun work at kongwa, and the first tasks of building the organisation and starting the clearing had been accomplished.Progress of the Clearing Work7. The clearing work has involved several operations, the cutting of tracesthrough the bush, the flattening of the bush, windrowing, the burning of thedebris in the windrows, the felling of the larger trees and the extraction ofthe roots. For each of these operations it has been necessary to develop atechnique adapted to the conditions on the spot. The complexity of the clearing work has been due to the particular character of the Kongwa thornbush. On the basis of experience elsewhere, it had been expected that theheavy rooting machines towed by. tractors would rip out the roots of the. bush, if not at the first attempt certainly at the second, to a sufficient depthfor the planting of groundnuts. In practice, the extensive tough and pliableroots of the Kongwa thorns and the multiplicity of stumps have provedbeyond the power of normal rooting machines. After many weeks of expertment with modifications of equipment, a method of de-rooting has been found,
but too late in the season to plant more than some 10,000 to 15,000 acresthis year. This particular difficulty is unlikely to .be met with in the newareas of Tanganyika to be developed in 1948, and subsequently.8. Large scale clearing operations may be regarded as having begun on1st July, by which date 97 clearing tractors had arrived at Kongwa. until september, almost all the tractors available for clearing work were concen-trated on the flattening of the maximum possible area of bush. In october the emphasis was moved to the windrowing of the debris and in November,on the basis of the varied experiments which had by then been carried out,to the removal of the roots, so that as much as possible of the cleared arecan be planted with groundnuts. In addition to the clearing work, over 100miles of traces have been cut through the bush in the Kongwa area in pre-paration for further clearing, and small areas have been cleared for the ploughing school at Kongwa, and experimentally in the Southern and WesternProvinces of Tanganyika.Difficulties which have delayed1 the Clearing Operations9. In Command 7030 attention was drawn to the risks, difficulties and delays inherent in a pioneering scheme of this kind. The delays in the arrival of the equipment early in 1947, which have already been described,caused some setback to the clearing work. The most serious obstacles to the rapid progress of the scheme, however, have been the small proportion of available tractors which it has proved possible to maintain in regular, opera -tion during these early months, and the character of the Kongwa bush.Spare parts, tools and mechanical repair facilities have been required ona far more extensive scale than it was possible to provide for at the outset.Indeed, up to the time when operations began, it had been impossible toobtain adequate spares. The Managing Agents have given special atten-tion to the improvement of the repair organisation, and additional workshops,tools and plant are being provided as rapidly as possible. Further suppliesof this sort of equipment are, however, needed to overcome the immediate difficulties, and for these, as for many other classes of supplies, the schemeis dependent to a very important extent on surpluses arising from militarydisposals. The shortage of mechanics and other skilled artisans will be overcome as quickly as possible by the training of a sufficient number of africans, but, in the meantime, 200 Italians, many of them with a know-ledge of Swahili, have been recruited on short term contracts to help to fill the gap.10. The number of tractors available for clearing operations has alsobeen reduced by the need to use a proportion of the total force for the urgent and important task of training African drivers, for the making of railways and roads, and for work in preparation for the erection of theessential buildings. In no one week, so far have more than 872 tractorhours been devoted to flattening the bush, or more than 2,590 tractor hours to windrowing.11. It must be recognised that the results so far achieved cover a periodof only five months since bush clearing was started on a substantial scale atthe beginning of July. During the period the most important task has been to find out, largely by a process of trial and error, the best methods to adopting order to put on a sound footing the recruitment and training of the staff,and their assimilation into co-ordinated teams for their different jobs, and todevelop by continued experiment the most suitable techniques for clearing the type of bush prevalent at Kongwa. There is good&apos;reason to expect a rapid speeding up of the bush clearing work, when this preparatory phase hasbeen completed, and a sufficient supply.of suitable equipment to eradicate
the roots of the Kongwa thorn bush has been obtained. One of the mostimportant changes in technique which has already been decided on is what may be described as &quot; selective clearing &quot;. In future any ground on whichthe vegetation is particularly dense will be left uncleared; the consequent con-centration of equipment on the easier ground will, it is expected, greatlyaccelerate clearing operations.&apos; Progress in the build-up of the organisation(a)   MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT(&quot;^12. The number of heavy tractors in Tanganyika at the end of each monthlias been as follows:May..................... 161June     ..................... 185July.........      ............ 258August..................... 330September        ................... 330October............&quot;......... 367November        .................. 420These numbers are actually in excess of what was originally planned for thefirst year, but they consist of secondhand machines.During the early months the rate of railing the tractors from the port ofDar-es-Salaam inland 240 miles to Kongwa was kmited to 12 a week owingto shortage of suitable rolling stock. This rate was, however, subsequentlydoubled by the release of wagon flats, which previously had been used forthe transporting of rails and sleepers for the railway extension from Masagalito Kongwa.13. Despite the failure of the experiments with the Valentine tank, furtherexperiments have been undertaken with other types of surplus tanks with aview to using them for clearing work. It has become clear, however, thattanks can be used for heavy bush clearing work only after very substantialstructural and mechanical modifications, and it has proved necessary to design special equipment to use with the tanks. There is now reason to hope that a successful adaptation of the Sherman Mark III tank will beachieved and that it will prove possible to meet from surplus tanks of this type a large proportion of the balance of the requirements of the schemefor heavy tractors.14. As has already been mentioned, the agricultural machinery requiredfor operations during 1947 and 1948 is being obtained from Canada. Muchof this machinery is not of a type which could be used in the U.K., the design of the machines being based on the development of mechanised ground-nut production in the Southern States of the U.S.A.15. A wide range of other kinds of machinery and equipment has beenobtained for the scheme. Landing craft and cranes have been acquired for-the landing of equipment, particularly in the Southern Province; for road transport, jeeps and lorries of different types in large numbers have had tobe obtained; for running repairs, many kinds of tools, and for base linerepairs, fully equipped workshops, including power lathes and grindingmachines and electric welding and other equipment; for the supply of water,equipment for bore holes, pumps and piping; for the health services, drugsand surgical equipment; for the land survey work  111(1 lx16 scientific unit,many kinds of laboratory supplies and surveying equipment; and for thehousing and the meagre comforts of the staff until permanent buildings can be built, large quantities of tents, huts, furniture, household and sanitary61461 A 2
supplies, building and electrical materials and equipment. These needs arebeing met, in almost all cases, either by ordinary commercial procurementwithout the exercise of any priority or from military-surpluses.(b) LABOUR16. At the end of November, 400 European staff and 5,500 Africans were employed on the scheme in Kongwa. The total number of Africans employedon the scheme elsewhere in Tanganyika was 1,000, of whom themajority were in the areas to be developed, in 1948, in the Western and southern Provinces. The recruitment of the African staff has been under-taken in -close co-operation with the Government of Tanganyika in ordeto avoid unnecessary competition with the recruitment of labour for this -growing of sisal or for other local industries.. At an early stage the schemewas explained to a meeting of the African Chiefs in the Dodoma district of tanganyika, and the recruitment of labour, largely of the Wagogo Tribe,&quot;from this district has proceeded with their support and approval. The schemeis proving attractive to African labour, and there have been instances ofmen walking 150 miles to join the staff in Kongwa. A strike originatingin the port of Dar-es-Salaam and on the central railway line in Tanganyikain September, 1947 developed into a &quot;sympathetic strike at Kongwa, but themen returned to duty after four days when they heard that the dockers inDar-es-Salaam had returned. No complaint was ,made by the Africans at kongwa of conditions of employment.17. The main shortage of labour, which it is believed it will be possibleto overcome by the expansion of training facilities, is of skilled Africanartisans (e.g., carpenters, plumbers, masons, electricians, fitters, lorry andtractor drivers). To meet this temporary shortage, 200 Italian mechanicsand other skilled workers have, as mentioned above, been recruited on short-term contracts and the recruitment of limited numbers of skilled workershas been extended to Kenya, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland and the gold coast. Satisfactory progress is being made with the training of Africans forwork on the scheme. The clearing tractor school opened in April, 1947, andthe agricultural tractor school in July, 1947. Up to the end of November456 African drivers have been passed as proficient in the operation of heavy(Clearing tractors and 240 in the operation of agricultural tractors. Theproportion of entrants for the training course failing to qualify as proficienthas been only 15 per cent, in the clearing tractor school and 10 .per cent,in the agricultural tractor school. One of the encouraging features of theoperations has been the aptitude shown by African labourers for semi-skilledwork in the repair of mechanical equipment.(c) RESEARCH18. The strong scientific research and control unit is undertaking a seriesof experiments in crop rotation, the use of fertilisers, seed selection etc., andhas initiated work preparatory to the local production of vegetables and live-stock products for consumption by the staff of the scheme.&apos; Experimentalplots have been laid out with the immediate objective of providing data onsuch problems as soil fertility, and agronomic experiments on the depth ofploughing, spacing, the time of planting, variety performance, weeding etc.have been started. The Chief Scientific Officer has been actively at worksince January, and later appointments to his staff include a chemist, a soilchemist, an agronomist, an entomologist and a geologist. The setting up ofa Soil Conservation Service for the scheme is foreshadowed in the appoint-ment of a Chief Soil Conservation Officer. The-boundaries of the area forcultivation are being determined on the basis of the soils and vegetationsurveys undertaken by the Scientific Staff, which is maintaining close contact
with the East African Agricultural Research Organisation, now being formedat Nairobi, and with Universities in the U.K. and in South Africa.19. Seven small trial plots in the Kongwa area were planted with ground-nuts in January 1947 and on the basis of their varying yields it is estimatedthat the average yield of decorticated groundnuts this year, assuming thesame spacing as is to be adopted in the planting of groundnuts in December1947 would have been over 900 lb. per acre, even though some of the plotswere on soils of low fertility. The yield on the most fertile of the plots was at the rate of 1580 lb. per acre.   The estimates of the cost of the scheme injmmand 7030 are based on a yield of 750 lb. of decorticated groundnutsper acre.(d) COMMUNICATIONS20. A new branch line 16 miles long has been built from Masagali on theCentral Tanganyika line to Kongwa. The work on this line was seriouslydelayed in February and March by the breaching of a railway embankmentfollowing the flooding of the River Kinyasunewe. There has been seriouscongestion at the port of Dar-es-Salaam owing to an increase in its normaltraffic coinciding with the arrival of large supplies for the scheme. special arrangements are being made, however, to ensure that the capacity of theport is used to the maximum possible extent. The present limited port facilities and the consequent danger of congestion will, however, remain aserious problem. There are no deep-water berths vessels must anchor inthe harbour and unload into lighters. Storage space at the docks is limited by the site and layout of the dock area, and clearance from the docks inlandis limited by shortages of railway rolling stock.21. A small technical mission visited Tanganyika in February 1947, to investigate and make recommendations on the suitability of sites for theconstruction of a deep water port to handle the supplies and produce &quot;ofthe main producing area, which is expected-eventually to extend to 1,650,000acres, in Southern Tanganyika. On the recommendation of this mission ithas been decided to build a port with deep water berths at Mikindani southof Lindi. This is a fine natural harbour completely landlocked and ships of deep draught can enter and leave at any state of the tide. Work has begunon the building of the port and of. the railway line 120 miles long connectingMikindani with the area to be developed in Southern Tanganyika. It is hopedthat the first berth will be completed by the end of 1948. Preparations arebeing made for the building of a pipe line from Mikindani for the supply of fuel to the Southern Province groundnuts area. Meanwhile, to enable thepreliminary opening up for development of the Southern Province areas toproceed in 1948, a temporary lighterage quay 600 feet long is being con-structed further North on Lindi Creek. Supplies and equipment will be moved up the Lukuledi Valley, initially by road, and then by rail, when thissection of the new railway is completed.(e) HOUSINGAt present, both the European and the African staff are living in tents.Suitable permanent housing will, however, be provided as quickly as possible and designs for the housing and for the lay-out of the first village have beenapproved. In the development of the large building programme new buildingmethods are being used relying on local materials to the utmost. The principalmaterial for the permanent buildings will be blocks made of local soil corn-pressed with a binding material (cement or local lime). In most areas therewill be ample timber for all the building requirements of the scheme.   At
Kongwa, however, the total absence of local building materials has madesatisfactory progress extremely difficult.Preparations for the extension of the Scheme to other areas22. Preparations are well advanced to begin clearing in 1948 in the western and Southern Province of Tanganyika, and to develop the clearing work inthe Kongwa area in the Central Province. By extending the work in severalareas with different climatic characteristics the risk of a set-back owing todrought will be materially reduced. A complete air contour survey, as wellas extensive soil and vegetation surveys, have been undertaken in each ofthe areas covered by the full programme of development. The results&quot;,these surveys have been encouraging except in Kenya where the areas origin-ally selected have been found to be unsuitable. It has, therefore, beendecided to exclude these areas from the scheme, but the Government of kenya has been invited to suggest alternative areas. In any event, thereis reason to believe that there are very large additional areas in SouthernTanganyika suitable for inclusion in the scheme if additional land is required.The scheme has aroused considerable interest in Northern Rhodesia, and theproblems involved in the extension of operations into that colony are atpresent under examination.Health, Welfare and Education23. The full programme of health, social and educational development which is part of the scheme cannot be introduced until the agricultural stage of the work has been reached and settled village communities established.Preparations are, however, well advanced and an efficient medical service with temporary hospital accommodation already exists.Thirty-four appointments have so far been made in the Medical Depart-ment, including doctors, nursing sisters, health visitors, hospital stewards, aradiographer, etc. In addition 200 Africans have been chosen for training as medical auxiliaries and nursing staff and the training of some of thesehas been completed. The health of the African staff generally may beexpected to improve as a result of the better diet they are already receivingand the medical services to which they have access. Since the opening ofthe temporary hospital there have been 20,572 attendances by the Africanstaff. The health of the European staff has, on the whole, been good.To overcome the difficulties of language in the technical training of the africans employed on the scheme, and ultimately in the general educationboth of the African employees and of their families., it has been decided tomake use of the valuable experience which was gained in the great expansionof the Indian Army during the war, when hundreds of thousands of recruitswere rapidly and successfully equipped with a basic knowledge of english and the ability to use it on their jobs. It will be necessary to make consider-able use of modern educational techniques including films, film strips, models,gramophones, etc. The preparations for the development of the educationalwork are being made with the co-operation of the Education Adviser to theColonial Secretary, the Education Department of the Government of tanganyika and with UNESCO which has agreed to send a consultantto help with the development of education policy. An Education and welfare Advisory Committee is being set up, -and the Chief Education Officer,who has recently been appointed takes up his duties in January, 1948.Finance24. The total net expenditure on the scheme up to 30th November, 1947,was  4,250,000. This expenditure has been almost entirely of a capital nature,a large part representing the cost of mechanical equipment required for
clearing and agricultural purposes. Until larger acreages with different types of vegetation have been cleared and the first unit installations completed,and a full year&apos;s agricultural operations carried out on at least one ^unit,it will not be possible to make any dependable revision of the estimated costs of production as set out in paragraphs 19-24 of Command 7030. All that can be said at this stage is that it is already clear that both the previouslyestimated costs and the previously estimated revenues of the scheme arelikely to be considerably higher than those given in Command 7030. Onthe one hand the prices of the mechanical equipment and stores of all kindsnecessary for the scheme are steadily rising, and in addition a larger expendi-e than had been anticipated will be necessary upon, in particular, thetransport services and the repair organisation. On the other, the world priceof oils and fats is also rising and now seems only too likely to remain at ahigh level for a much longer period than was envisaged a year ago.These two developments, which are merely what was to be expected inthe case of a scheme being carried out in conditions of rising prices on a world-wide scale, will of course affect the scheme in opposite directions.The rising costs will adversely affect it, the rising prices of its product will tend to make it more profitable. It would be quite unrealistic to pretend that any balance between these opposite tendencies can at present be struck.No useful purpose would therefore be served in attempting a revision of thefigures given in Command 7030.Two further indications of the general prospects of the scheme may however be mentioned. As already stated in paragraph 19 above, there is some evidence that the yield of groundnuts was most conservatively estimated at75a lb. per acre in Command 7030. Second, there is now a prospect of asubstantial new source of revenue to be devised from timber resources of theareas to be developd in the Southern and Eastern provinces of Tanganyika.Summary25. Reference was made in Command 7030 to the analogy, between the carrying out of this cheme and certain military operations of the last war.In reviewing the progress made in the past year, it becomes clear thatthe criteria to be applied are those by which the success of the initial phasesof a modern military operation is judged, rather than those which are usuallyapplied to a commercial enterprise. The two most important factors aresupplies and transport,- for the building up and deployment of the vastquantities of operational and maintenance stores and equipment. The east african Groundnut Scheme is still in the phase of building up the bridgeheadand consolidating the organisation required to direct and control the firstmajor advance. Over the critical field of procurement of supplies and equip-ment as a whole progress is well up to schedule, and in some sectors of this front ahead of schedule. On the other hand, the acreage of land clearedis far behind schedule. This is a healthier situation than the reverse wouldbe.26. The experience of the first six months of bush clearing in the Central .- Province of Tanganyika has not brought to light any unforeseen factors tocast doubt on the validity of the basic principles on which the scheme isfounded. There will clearly be many technical problems to be solved; theirsolution will require a high degree of skill and flexibility in management.There is, however, no more reason now than there was a 3&apos;ear ago to doubtthat the whole scheme modified here and there as to its details in the light ofthe experience continually being gained can be carried out on the broadlines and within the time schedule set out in Command 7030.(61461)  Wt. 1478 1378   13   1/48   D.L.
