(48) 3026th January, 1948CABINETUNITED NATIONS  EDUCATIONAL, SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURALORGANISATIONSecond General conference memorandum by the Minister of education in submitting the attached Report by my Parliamentary Secretary I wishto state my conviction that U.N.E.S.C.O. can become a powerful internationalagency for the defence and propagation of that principle of the free developmentof the human spirit which characterises liberal Western European civilisationand which at present is either in jeopardy or is effectively denied in many countries.The Member States constituting U.N.E.S.GO. pledge themselves to the&quot; unrestricted pursuit of objective truth and the free exchange of ideas and knowledge.&quot; They are &quot;agreed and determined to develop and increase themeans of communication between their peoples and to employ these means forthe purposes of mutual understanding and a truer and more perfect knowledgeof each other&apos;s lives.&quot; Furthermore, they intend &quot; to further universal respect for justice, and the rule of Law, and for the human rights and fundamentalfreedoms which are affirmed for the peoples of the world without distinctionof race, sex, language or religion.&quot;The U.S.S.R. has never joined U.N.E.S.C.O.2. But the success of U.N.E.S.C.O., like that of other Specialised agencies of the United Nations and like the United Nations Organisation itself, dependsalmost entirely upon the energy which each Member State puts into makinginternational co-operation effective so far as it is concerned. We took theresponsibility of fostering U.N.E.S.C.O. and launching it upon the world inLondon and I am glad to report that we and the Commonwealth have sinceretained the leadership in its deliberations. We have everything to gain byconsolidating and sustaining this position. It is worth recording, moreover,that U.N.E.S.C.O. is the only Specialised Agency of the United Nations towhich His Majesty&apos;s Government is able to pay its annual contribution in sterling. I therefore ask my colleagues to ensure that their Departments are continually on the look-out for ways in which to help the Ministry of education to make a success of the part we are pledged to play in U.N.E.S.C.O.&apos;s programme.3. In the Ministry of Education, we have now created a series of NationalCo-operating Bodies through whose interest and energy we expect to earn-forward in this country the impetus created by U.N.E.S.C.O. in favour of inter-national co-operative effort in the fields of Education, Natural Science, SocialScience, Library work, Museum work, the creative Arts, the Press, the radio and Film world and in the Humanities. These Bodies, now totalling a member-ship of some 250 people, eminent in their own spheres and representative ofnational institutions and learned societies, constitute a permanent advisory service the like of which has never before existed in the public administrationof this country. The Secretariat, which I supply, is shortly to be located in23 Belgrave Square, S.W. 1, as a small special division of the Ministry ofEducation, where it will be available as a source of reference and advice upon all U.N.E.S.C.O. business.G.

annex report by Mr. D. R. Hardman, M.P., on the Second General Conference of u.N.E.S.C.O. in Mexico City, November 1947A. introduction.   Before dealing with the work of the Conference in detail, I wish to makea few general remarks.   I shall confine these within the next paragraph.2. (a) The Conference met, worked and broke up in an atmosphere of theutmost cordiality. While there was occasionally strong discord or, more often,complications arising from the factors mentioned in the remainder of thisparagraph, it is clearly apparent that the solidarity of purpose which brought the conference together in Mexico was stronger and more mature than the enthusiasm which created the Organisation in London in 1945.(&amp;) In this spirit, the Conference attained a very great measure of agreementbetween views that were, initially and essentially, at variance. The result was an unanimously accepted programme and, of greater significance, a properlyanalysed and computed budget, shaped as exactly as possible to that programme.The fact that the United Kingdom Delegation opposed the budget figure fromfirst to last does not in any way detract from the accurate and business-likeproduct of the work of the Conference as a whole. I should like to stress at thispoint the practical, down-to-the-ground considerations which for the most partguided the debates of the Conference. Most delegations seemed to be growingaware that the ideals of the Constitution must be tempered by the administrativeskills needed to interpret them and by the financial resources available to put them into practice.(c) The Conference was characterised by two factors of a political nature.In the first instance, Poland, doubtless acting on the firmest instructions, intro-duced a resolution on warmongering and war propaganda, with the usual trainof innuendo. The Americans were extremely active in opposing the draft and ultimately succeeded in getting adopted a substitute French motion of a rhetoricalbut emasculate nature. Nevertheless, the negotiations in the Special Sub-Committee set up to deal with this matter, of which I was Chairman, had anunderlying acrimony and I believe that this element will now always be presentuntil the Organisation finally settles its relationship with Eastern Europe, one way or the other. Other similar instances were when the Polish Delegate openlyaccused the Canadian Government of illegally retaining in Canada certain Polishart treasures and when it accused the United States of deliberately reducingthe budget appropriation for reconstruction in order to strengthen its own foreignimperialist policy of aid to Europe, excluding Eastern Europe. I should add,however, that my own relationship and that of the United Kingdom Delegationas a whole with the Polish Delegation, especially its leader, the Ambassador inMexico, was one of friendliness and, within limits, of understanding.(d) The second political factor was the growing voting strength of the latin american Republics, which now number twelve in the Organisation and whichhope to increase this figure very shortly. The practice of block-voting has not previously been seriously apparent. If developed, it will certainly affect thepresent freedom of judgment and integrity of voting which I believe is oneof the healthiest attributes of this Organisation. This growing tendency foundits most marked expression when a joint resolution by all twelve Latin american republics was presented to the Plenary Conference requiring Spanish to be addedas a permanent third working language. Introduced by Sefior Gual Vidal.Secretary for Public Education in Mexico and supported by innumerableoratorical tours de force, the motion was ultimately defeated by 20 votes to 12,but only by referring the position to the Co-ordinating Committee of the united nations and Specialised Agencies.(e) I should note that the General Conference determined to hold its ThirdSession in Beirut at the invitation of the Lebanese Government. This decision was reached only after much discussion and two votes. I personally spoke Nstrongly against such a move, and was supported by most of my Commonwealthcolleagues as well as by the United States. We were outvoted, however, largely owing to solid support for Beirut by the Latin American States and by France.The resolution, on the other hand, does allow the Executive Board to change the
222seat of the Conference if special circumstances make this necessary. In view ofthe present doubt as to the location of the General Assembly in Europe and ofthe unsettled state of the Near East, it is, of. course, possible that a change mayhave to be made by the Executive Board, perhaps back to Paris.(/) Without entering into details over the Delegates or Delegations present,it was noticeable what a decisive measure of leadership came from the Common-wealth Delegations and especially from the United Kingdom. The Organisationgained much from the presence of Mr. S. D. Pierce, Canadian Ambassador toMexico and leader of the Canadian Delegation, Dr. C. E. Beeby (New Zealand)was a brilliant Chairman of the Programme and Budget Commission, and SenatorEdgar Brooks (South Africa) an excellent Rapporteur to the Administrative and external Relations Commission. Dr. E. R. Walker (Australia) was electedChairman of the Executive Board for 1948. From India, Dr. SarvepalliRhadhahkrishnan was probably the Conference^ most accomplished orator, and dr. Bhabha, in the field of Natural Sciences, proved to be a forceful policy-maker.In all places, at all times, Sir John Maud (United Kingdom) maintained hisunique position in the Organisation of authority and persuasiveness.(g) With the United States Delegation, we early established the most friendly co-operation. My impression was that they were scrupulously carefulnever to expose themselves to the criticism of trying to frog-march the Organisa-tion on account of their large budget contribution (now 41-88 per cent.) or oftheir extraordinarily virile and effective National Commission. Perhaps for thisreason they did not appear to be so energetic or active in session as they woreout of session. There were also, I think, certain unresolved dissensions insidetheir Delegation. Through conversations in Washington and elsewhere, with the acting Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs and with other membersof their Delegation, it appears that they have not yet solved the fundamentalproblem of departmental responsibility for U.N.E.S.C.O. The State department is very active, and particularly interested, in U.N.E.S.C.O., but has not yet satis-factorily related itself to the National Commission, which consists of powerfulrepresentatives of the voluntary organisations, labour associations and university and cultural institutions. The position is further complicated by the fact that theOffice of Education regards U.N.E.S.C.O.&apos;s responsibilities and interests as ratherwider than its own. It is unwilling, therefore, to take over any primary control or interest in the National Commission. The strength and efficacy of its NationalCommission is enormous. This difficulty is therefore of outstanding importance.Whilst I believe that the shape and function of their National Commission hasseveral advantages over our system of Co-operating Bodies, I am clear that wehave solved the administrative problem more efficiently then they. It would beof great value for both countries to exchange views and experiences wherever possible over this difficult point.(A) About the Secretariat little need be said. About 300 out of the total 590were in Mexico City. Occasionally the wrong proportion of grades and expertswere brought along, but they were extremely hardworking and faithful. Thebulk of the Conference documents were lost in transit and this preliminaryconfusion, though admirably overcome, did place the efficiency of the Secretariatin doubt at the opening of the Conference. In particular, the Director-Generalinevitably incurred personally criticisms that should normally have beendistributed elsewhere. I believe, however, that throughout the Conference, he fully restored his reputation and probably added to it by his efficient and states-manlike behaviour. Dr. W. Laves, the Deputor Director General (United States),who had to face a great deal of criticism, some personal, proved throughout a level-headed and very conscientious administrator, though never a brilliant one.My own impression was that M. J. Thomas, the Assistant Director-General(France) made no real contribution to the success of the Conference that was inany way discernible.(i) There is no doubt that the organisation of the Conference, its divisionsinto Commissions, Sub-Commissions, Committees and working-parties and thestill impermanent and unco-ordinated state of the rules of procedure, hamperedthe smooth running of the Conference. The United Kingdom Delegation took the lead in suggesting remedies and had adopted a resolution, including recommen-dations to revise the present machinery. This should obviate next year the diffi-culties of this.(j) Finally, I must place- on record the great efforts made by the mexican government to receive, entertain, and assist the Conference in every way.  Suchbehaviour on the part of a Government and the vivid interest which the34838 .. b 2
UNESCO Conference aroused in the peoples and press of Mexico are very powerful arguments in favour of holding the Conference each year in a differentof the world.B. Report on Conference3. The Second Session of the General Conference of U.N.E.SC.O. opened atMexico City in the Escuela Normal de Maestros on 6th November 1947. 125 Dele-gates, representing 36 countries, together with 174 experts and advisers and 53observers were present. The Conference was formally opened by the Presidentof the Republic, Settor Miguel Aleman, at the Palacio de Bellas Artes under thechairmanship of M. Jacques Maritain of France, the country which last yearprovided the office of President of the Conference.4 At its conclusion on 4th December, the General Conference had approved a Programme of Work for 1948 and a Budget, fitted to that Programme, of$7 682 637. It had also authorised the Director-General to call in 1948 for afurther $1 million out of the $3 million Revolving Fund, authorised by the FirstGeneral Conference. Finally it had approved a detailed Report of its Adminis-trative and External Relations Commission.5. The Conference, once inaugurated, elected Senor Gual Vidal, Secretaryof Public Education for Mexico, as President of the Conference. The seven Vice-Presidents were nominated from Belgium, Brazil, India, Lebanon, Peru, poland and United States. The Chairman of the Programme and Budget commission was provided by New Zealand (Dr. Beeby), of the Administrative and external relations Commission by China (Dr. Han Li-Wuh), of the Nominations Com-mittee by Canada (Mr. S. D. Pierce), of the Procedures Committee by UnitedKingdom (myself) and of the Credentials Committee by Turkey.The above nominees formed the General Committee of the Conference.6. The Conference admitted to membership Austria, Hungary, Italy and switzerland, thus bringing total membership to 40.7. The following elections to the Executive Board were approved by theConference, each for a period of three years except in the case of the United states which is for two years: United Kingdom (Sir John Maud), China (Dr. ChenYuan), Australia (Dr. Walker), United States (Dr. Stoddart), Poland(Dr. Arnold), Mexico (Dr. Martinez-Baez), Ecuador (Dr. Carrion). The nomina-tions which were originally before the Conference had Dr. Encarnacion Alzona,of the Philippines, a woman, in place of Dr. Carrion of Ecuador, on therecommendation of the United States. In the plenary conference this lady wasdisplaced by Dr. Carrion with the support of the Latin American States.8. After five plenary sessions, the Conference broke up.into a programme and Budget Commission (which ultimately held 19 meetings) a Budget Sub-Commission (holding 22 meetings), an Administrative and External relations commission (holding 14 meetings) and 14 working parties (holding a total of53 meetings). The findings of the technical working parties were made availableto the Programme and Budget Commission which alone took substantive decisions on the content of the Programme. All recommendations of the programme andBudget Commission concerning approved items of the Programme were trans-mitted to its Budget Sub-Commission for pricing. Ultimately the completebudgetary decisions of this Sub-Commission were handed back to the parent bodythe Programme and Budget Commission. The General Conference, therefore inPlenary Session, considered and approved this Report of the Programme andBudget Commission, together with the Report of its Commission on Administra-tion and External Relations.9. This Report will deal briefly in the following paragraphs with theProgramme, the Report of the Administrative and External relations commission, and the Budget (the full texts of which are attached as AppendicesA, B and C respectively). ^10.   A list of the United Kingdom Delegation is attached as Appendix E.The Budget for 1948^ i!K H w^,d^ed that, early in. the Session, a ceiling figure for the Budgetshould be fixed by the Conference. The United Kingdom immediately ma^dfastrong speech suggesting that a good programme could be carried Onf for
$7 million, in place of the estimated figure of $8,507,000. There was animmediate move by Belgium, supported by Poland and Mexico, for the largerfigure of $8,500,000. A series of modifications was then suggested : $8 million by France and Czechoslovakia, 17,700,000 by Canada and $6,500,000 by Norway,though there was no seconder for this last motion. At vote, the figure of$8,500,000 was rejected by nine to fifteen against (the United Kingdom votingagainst) with one abstention and nine absent. The figure of $8 million wasadopted by fifteen to eleven against (Canada. China, Denmark. Greece,Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, United Kingdom,Colombia and Venezuela being the eleven voting against) with nine absent.In General Conference, this motion was taken to read on Australian initiativethat a ceiling of $8 million was approved at the outset of the Conference, withinwhich a detailed Budget should later be approved according to the worth of theProgramme worked out South Africa further suggested that, with the inclusionof the Revolving Fund, this total figure should not exceed $9 million.12. At the conclusion of the Conference, a Budget figure of $7,707,637was presented for approval with an additional $1 million for the RevolvingFund. Australia, with our active support, moved an immediate reduction of10 per cent, on the Budget figure to reduce it to $7 million. This found littlesupport and, after minor amendments, a total figure of $7,682,637 was approved,together with an additional $1 million for the Revolving Fund.13. This total figure may be broken down in two ways, by administrativechapters, and by programme items, with non-separable estimates shown addition-ally. It was decided that next year&apos;s Budget form should include both methodsof exposition.   Under administrative chapters the 1948 Budget reads :-*-Chapter -$I. Conferences and Meetings       ...      ... 285,030II. Personnel............... 3,911,527III. Common Services............ 1.552,000IV.-Grants-in-Aid     ............ 614,080V. Expenses of Initial Recruitment       ... 970,000Reserve     ............... 350,0007,682,637Under a system of classification by programme items, the breakdown reads :  General Policy   ............... 402,867General Administration         ...      ...      ... 1,969,957Programme Operations ...       ...      ...       ... 4,959,813Reserve     .................. 350,0007,682,637The Programme for 194814. The 1948 Programme explicitly assumes that the main purpose of u.N.E.S.C.O. is to make more real the idea of a world society. This end is tobe sought by action on a number of concrete tasks, each defined by a resolution of the Conference giving specific directions to the Director-General and, in manycases, indicating the action which should be taken by Member States, NationalCommissions and Co-operating Bodies.These tasks are grouped under six heads : (i) Reconstruction: man helping man to recover from the war.(ii) Communication: man speaking to man; through visits and exchange ofpersons; through radio, films and the press; through libraries, books and other publications. ,(iii) Education: man helping-man to grow in knowledge.(iv) Cultural interchange: man sharing with man his best work in the fields of creative arts, letters, philosophy and the humanities.(v) Human and social relations: men nelping men to live together, by workin the fields common to social science and philosophy.(vi) Natural Sciences: man helping man to know and control nature and the physical environment.Administration and External Relations15.   A short statement of what was accomplished in this field is given inthe Introductory Section to the Report of the Administrative and External
relations Commission attached as Appendix B. Concerning the administrative and financial reserves, I need only add that very great attention was paid tothe Secretariat, its size, its structure, its functions and its remuneration. Inthis work, the United Kingdom and the United States Delegations played the major roles, though the latter, speaking through Mr. Walter Kotschnig, wentfurther than we in openly criticising certain aspects of the administration.Probably all the earlier errors, especially in the financial accounting, have by now been eradicated.16. The External relations section of this Commission^ work went verysmoothly, largely owing to the excellent preparatory work of M. Andre de Blonay(Switzerland), Head of the External relations Division of the Secretariat. Therewere, in general, three important items on this part of the agenda. Firstly, thequestion of the regional representation of U.N.E.S.C.O., outside its headquarters,was vigorously raised. The United Kingdom view was that any expansion mustbe strictly controlled and co-ordinated with other United Nations regional centres and policies. On this understanding the matter was referred to the united nations for their views.17. Secondly, much valuable work was done in regulating the Organisation^relationship with non-member States, with other organs of the United Nations,and especially with international non-governmental and semi-governmental organisations. Though much remains to be done to obtain satisfactory workingrelations with non-member States and with the United Nations, a final policy with regard to non-governmental and semi-governmental organisations, largelyformulated by the United Kingdom Delegation, was agreed upon.18. Thirdly, the General Conference adopted a form of resolution con-cerning the Organisation^ relations with Germany and Japan which the UnitedKingdom Delegation submitted in place of the totally inadequate and unrealisticsuggestions which the Secretariat had prepared. Their work in this field probablyrepresents their worst work over the year, mostly due to badlv chosen consultants.The Allied Control Authorities in Berlin, on the other hand, have, as yet, taken a great deal longer to negotiate or even communicate with the Organisation than is justifiable. I should add that in the final debates on this point a complicatedprocedural wrangle arose between the Polish and the United Kingdom Delega-tions, which was resolved when the Conference settled in our favour.D.

APPENDIX AFINAL RESOLUTIONSThe Programme of UNESCO in . 1948^ INTRODUCTION.m^In 1948 Unesco will concentrate its efforts and resources, both within member states^ and in the Secretariat, on a limited number of activities, defined by theGeneral Conference in the following resolutions. These fall under six mainheads and are grouped in six chapters entitled:  Reconstruction (Chapter i).Communication (Chapter 2).Education (Chapter 3).-Cultural Interchange (Chapter ,4).Human and Social Relations (Chapter 5).- Natural Sciences (Chapter 6).Throughout all parts of this programme for 1948, Unesco will seek to make more real the idea of a world society by promoting collaboration in specifictasks between Governments and peoples and between educators, scientists,scholars, creative artists, experts in radio, films and the Press and all workersin related fields.The resolutions in Chapter 1, &quot; Reconstruction,&quot; are concerned with educa-tional, scientific and cultural reconstruction in the war-devastated countries.Chapter 2, &quot; Communication,&quot; includes those parts of the programme which seek to increase understanding across national frontiers by variousmeans: first, through visits and exchange of persons; secondly, through radio,films and the press; thirdly, through libraries, books and publications.In Chapter 3, &quot; Education,&quot; the various parts of the educational pro-gramme are brought together, beginning with those of first priority.Chapter 4, &quot; Cultural Interchange,&quot; includes, first, a group of resolutionsin the fields of Arts and Letters; secondly, work on translation and collectionsof great books; thirdly,, resolutions in the fields of philosophy and thehumanities, and fourthly, museums.In Chapter 5, &quot;Human and Social Relations,&quot; various resolutions are brought together relating to fields of study and action which are the common concern of social scientists, humanists and philosophers.Finally, in Chapter 6, &quot; Natural Sciences,&quot; are the resolutions which relate to mans knowledge and control of nature.therefore the General Conference, assembled in its Second Session, in the light of the documents submitted to the Conference and of its deliberations-thereon, resolves-as follows:In accordance with Article VjB.5. of the Constitution, the Executive board is responsible for -the execution of this Programme and shall accordinglyexercise general authority over the action taken by the Director-General inthe implementation of these resolutions. .*.-:- .5
1. RECONSTRUCTION.1.1. Co-operation with the United Nations and National Bodies.1.1.1. The Director-General is instructed, following the contacts already madewith the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations and the EconomicCommissions in Europe and the Far East, to approach the appropriate organsof the United Nations and the Specialised Agencies in order to ensure thatin ihe development of reconstruction plans, proper attention shall be paidto the needs of reconstruction in the educational, scientific and cultural fields.1.1.2. The General Conference:1.1.2,1. Recommends  that   National   Committees  of   Non-Governmen&apos;*Organisations for educational, scientific and cultural reconstruction shouldbe formed in all Member States for the purpose of assisting in the task ofrebuilding the means-of learning and culture in war-devastated countries.1.1.2.2. Takes note of the United Nations Appeal for Children intendedprimarily to provide funds for the International Children&apos;s Emergency Fund(which is designed by the General Assembly of the United Nations to meetthe emergency relief needs of children, adolescents, expectant and nursing mothers) and recognises the importance of a successful outcome of this appeal.1.1.2.3.

The Director-General is instructed to continue to provide the Secre-tariat for the Temporary International Council for Educational Reconstruc-tion, in order to aid in the co-ordination of voluntary efforts, while fullyrespecting the autonomy of the co-operating groups and to endeavour to secure from contributing organisations full reports concerning their activities.1.2.2. The General Conference recommends to Member States:.1.2.2.1. That appropriate agencies and organisations within each member state shall co-operate to the utmost with Unesco in making effective its pro-gramme for educational, scientific and cultural reconstruction.1.2.2.2.

The preparation of selective analyses of the needs of the war-devas-tated countries, including the lew Member States of Unesco, indicating which forms of assistance and whiclr areas have the highest priority.1.3.3.2. The production of materials suitable for national campaigns, par-ticularly films and illustrated pamphlets.,1.1
1.4.&quot; Work of Member States. The General Conference recommends to Mem-ber States the urgent importance of arranging for:1.4.1. Duty-free entrance of contributed educational material.T.4.2. More adequate reporting to donors about the use of contributedmaterials.1.5. Emergency Action by Unesco.1.5.1. The Director-General is instructed:tt,I.I.

APPENDIX BReport of the Administrative and external relations Commission(as approved by the Second Session oj the General Conference&apos;)ADMINISTRATIVE AND EXTERNAL RELATIONS COMMISSION   4The Commission elected Dr. Han LihOVVu of China as its Chairman and dr. Howard E. Wilson of the United States of America as its Vice-Chairman,and considered the subjects mentioned in Annex I to this Report.Introductory. The work of the Commission falls into two parts adminis-tration, including financial and staff questions; and external relations. Thisyear, perhaps of necessity, more time was given to the first half of the work,without derogation to the great importance of the second. before proceeding to a detailed enumeration of the action taken withregard to the administrative half of the Commission^ work, it seems rightto adopt the somewhat unusual procedure of first summing up the general effect of its recommendations and the spirit in which it has made them.The Commission as a whole gave the most detailed and assiduous attentionto this part of its work, and has laid down what it believes to be soundfoundations for future policy. We found ourselves faced with many ofthe inevitable disadvantages of an organisation which was necessarily ahastily improvised one and called to guide Unesco as to the principles onwhich future administrative policy should be based. There were differences of emphasis in our discussions, but a general measure of agreement that,combined with a sound and prudent financial administration and a seriouseffort to avoid extravagance, waste and overlapping, should be a policy ofbuilding up a more permanent staff, adequately remunerated, their recruit-ment better distributed geographically than at present, its members com-petent in every case for the work entrusted to them, and assisted to cope with the difficulties of life at Unesco&apos;s headquarters. The comprehensiveresolution which appears as Annex III sums up the common mind of theCommission on these matters. The Commission looks confidently to theworking-out of these principles by the Director-General during the forth-coming year, and to a process of consolidation and good organisation, com-bined with a judicious policy of progress in the new fields approved by theGeneral Conference.Financial questions the Commission considered with care the Report of the Executive Boardon the financial administration of the Organisation, and also the Auditors&apos;Report, and, recognising the serious nature of the latter document, waspleased to note the steps taken to prevent the recurrence of financial irregular-larities. The Commission, however, desired to ensure that as far as possibleevery loophole for irregularity had been closed, and appointed a SpecialSub-Committee to go into the matter with the Secretariat. The Report ofthis Sub-Committee was approved by the Commission, which earnestlycommended to the General Conference and through it to the executive board the directives contained in this report. &quot;Recommendations as to thescale and currency of contributions will be found in Annex I, paragraphs i30OR
239and 2 respectively, and recommendations as to Financial Statements in annex I, paragraph 4.The Commission was troubled by the fact that a number of Member states are still in arrears with their contributions. Proposals to meet this situa-tion are found in Annex I, paragraph 3. 1The Financial Regulations were subjected to careful review and certain amendments approved. The Regulations in their amended form are attached in Annex II.Staff QuestionsF The Commission^ recommendations as to the general principles of staffrecruitment, organisation and remuneration, are laid down, as already statedin Annex III. iThe Commission also went with care through the Staff Regulations and approved certain amendments. Annex IV contains the amended StaffRegulations.Organisation questions the Commission considered the measures taken to implement the principlesof organisation approved at the First Session of the General Conference,3,nci tliG extent to which the organisation was satisfactory in the light of theprogramme to be adopted for 1948, and passed the resolution attached as annex V.Relations with States Members and States Non-members the Commission has broken new ground with regard to the representationof Unesco in Member States, both by reconsidering first steps to implement the principle of Regional Offices and also by urging visits by key membersof the Secretariat to strategic areas. (See Annex VI, 1.) The Commissionfeels strongly the urgent need of greater knowledge of the Organisationand its work in Member States, especially those in remote parts of the world.The Commission has also advocated a change of policy regarding StatesNon-Members, in the direction of somewhat increasing the relative advantages of membership.   (See Annefc VI, 5.)- Further points of great importance are the resolutions indicating the future relations of the Organisation with Germany and Japan (Annex VI, para-graphs 6 and 7 respectively).Other matters on which recommendations are made are:Technical advice to Governments of Member States (Annex VI, 2). 1Reports by Member States (Annex VI, 3).General Policy concerning Recommendations to Member States and international Conventions (Annex VI, 4).Trust and Non-self-governing Territories (Annex VI, 8).Aid to Spanish children and students in exile (Annex VI, 18).National Commissions and Co-operating BodiesThe Commission had the benefit of a most useful Report from a specialWorking Party on this subject, based on which is the resolution appearingas Annex VI, 9.Relations with the United NationsA resolution was passed concerning budgetary co-ordination between theUnited Nations and Unesco.   (Annex VI. 10.)  This is, in the opinion of the
Commission, a question of special importance, and the attention of theGeneral Conference is accordingly directed to it.Privileges and Immunities of the Specialised Agencies-.(See Annex V., n.)Relations with the Specialised Agenciesi;(See Resolution in Annex VI, 12.)Relations with other organisations the Commission considered the Director-General&apos;s Report on existing agree-ments with intergovernmental international organisations, and on existing!;agreements with non-governmental international organisations. It also con-sidered the question of future relations with non-governmental international organisations, including the bases on which grants-in-aid should be paid.Its resolutions on these matters appear as Annex VI, paragraphs 13 to 17.The Commission specially draws the attention of the General Conference tothe important proposed directives on the subject of future relations with international non-governmental organisations contained in Annex VI, 17.Conclusion.In conclusion the Commission trusts that, facing as it has done, anunusually heavy task, it has succeeded in laying down principles which aresound and which,.should put the good ship &quot;Unesco&quot; in a satisfactorycondition for the voyages of adventure and discovery which it should make,resisting both the temptation to let it put out to sea in an unseaworthycondition, and also the temptation to keep it safely and ingloriously in harbour,-LIST OF ANNEXES TO THE REPORT OF THEADMINISTRATIVE AND EXTERNAL RELATIONS COMMISSIONAnnex I.

The attached table shows the estimated cost of the projects containedin the resolutions approved by the Programme and Budget Commission.These resolutions were transmitted to the Budget Sub-Commission, costedby the Secretariat and then presented to the Budget Sub-Commission for their consideration. Each project contained in the resolutions was thoroughlydiscussed with the Chairman or Rapporteur of the Working Party, and thehead of the section concerned. Any cuts in the projects or costs were onlymade after careful consideration of the ability of the Secretariat to carry through the projects provided for in the programme for 1948.2. Owing to the shortness of time available to the Secretariat to calculatedetail, and because certain reductions made in the total estimates duringthe last meetings of the Budget Sub-Commission have not yet been distributed among the individual projects concerned, these costs must be regarded asapproximations. They were, however, considered sufficiently accurate toserve as a basis for the estimates prepared by the Secretariat for the appro-priation table. These estimates can further serve the Executive Board asa guide in considering the detailed table referred to in the appropriationresolution, which will be presented by the Secretariat at the next meeting ofthe Executive Board.3. The attached estimates do not include certain costs such as welfare,refund of national income tax, allowances, common services, rent, furnitureand equipment, supplies, freight, cars, contracts, etc., which are now includedin the programme costs in the appropriation table. Since these costs havebeen distributed by programme in the appropriation table there is a discrep-ancy between the total programme cost shown in the appropriation table andthe total of $3,228,952 shown in these provisional estimates of costs of individual projects.* The Executive Board is authorised to adjust the allocation of this sum for the purposeof carrying out the resolutions regarding tho Hylean Amazon passed by the general conference, and the Director-General is authorised to incur necessary expenditures lor thispurpose before the Executive Board takes its decision.
