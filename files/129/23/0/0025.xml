In view of the importance of scrap supplies forthe maintenance of a high level of steel production, mycolleagues may like to have this general roport on the position.In it I deal with some of the specific questions which have&quot;been raised at recent meetings of various ministerial committees.THE STATISTICAL POSITION2.     (a)    Total requirements Millions of tons(i)   For Ik million ingot tons 8.5of steel:(ii)   For iron castings, pig iron and wrought iron:Total:    11.5(b)   Estimated availabilities in 19*4-8(i)   Prom arisings in the 5o6psteel industry itself:(ii)   Normal collections from 5*005industry: -Total: 10.370This leaves approximately 1.1 million tons to besecured from imports.(c)   Stocks on hand at steelworksTons1st January, 19*4-7 621,00030th June, 19*4-7 *4-82i,0003rd January, 19*4-8 373,000-1-
The stock at the 3rd January represented an increaseof i+0,000 tons since the 20th December, 1947.   Even allowing for the fall in stool production in the holiday period, thisindicates a definite improvbradiit in the position.   the build-up is 7 times as much as in the same -ocriod in 19h3/4nearly 13 times as much as in 1944/5 and 8 times as muchas in 19.Lj.6/7.SPECIAL MEASURES TO INCREASE SCRAP DELIVERIES PROMUNITED KINGDOM PRODUCTION&quot;3*      (a)    A special appeal to industry was launched inOctober by the Iron and Steel Federation, the Joint IronCouncil and the National Federation of Scrap Iron, steel and Metal Merchants (acting in concert and with the supportof the Federation of British industries).Industrialists wore asked (i) to ensure rapidclearance of normal production scrap and (ii) to institute a survey of their works in order to discard for scrap allold and redundant plant.(b) The National Coal Board,  the Service Departments,the Royal Ordnance Factories and other State-controlledundertakings were asked by the Iron and Steel Board to take similar action.   Scrap release from Royal Ordnance factories in November and December totalled 6,314 tons and 6,249 tons respectively as compared with an average of under 5,000 tonsin the preceding three months.(c) The full effect of these appeals cannot yet be assessed, but the initial response has boon very satisfactory.Total scrap deliveries to steel works during the 7 weeks ended the 27th December, 1947,  showed an increase of 6,300 tonsa week as compared with the corresponding period in 1946.The average weekly deliveries throughout 1947 were 74,000.tons:the average in the 7 weeks ended the 27th December, 1947,was 82,000 tons.(d) I was asked by the Production Committee on the 12thDecember (P.C.(47) 5th Meeting, Minute 7) to consider whetherthe supply of scrap could be improved &quot;by a suitable publicity campaign&quot;.    I think that in view of the encouraging reception of the appeals referred to at (a) and (b) above, no specialpublicity campaign by the Government is needed at the moment.But I hope that my colleagues, in any speeches which theymay make to industrialists, will not fail to refer to the continuing need for maximum scrap deliveries.(e) The light &quot;destructor-&apos; scrap thrown up from householdcollections is normally usable only in limited quantities inblast furnaces.   These are at present receiving all thesupplies that can bo utilised, and I do not recommend thereforeany appeal to the general public for scrap.(f) The extent to which scrap supplies might be increasedby an expansion of shipbroaking capacity, given availability of labour and an adequate supply of ships for breaking upin 1948. and 1949 will be the subject of o separate memorandum.About 180,000 tons of scrap were obtained from shipbroakingyards in 1947:    during recent weeks deliveries from this sourcehave averaged about 5*000 tons a week.   My hope is that, givencertain conditions, tho yield from this source might be expanded to 350,000 tons a year.
(g) At ray request tho Iron and Stool Board havoconsidorod whether tho yield of scrap from industry wouldbe likely to bo substantially oxpandod by an increase inscrap prices, but their considered view is that any suchadvance of prices would not be instrumental in securingadditional supplies. &apos; .(h) The Iron and Stool Board arc in close touch withthe War Office and Admiralty with tho object of acceleratingand expanding releases of surplus material for scrapping.Approximately 111,000 tons of carbon steel scrap and 35,000-tons of cast iron scrap were obtained in 191+7 from the break-down of ammunition, machine tools and other surplus warstores.    This is, however, bound to bo a diminishing source of material.    Much surplus material is found to be reusablein its existing form - o.g. machine tools, material fromMorrison and Anderson shelters, and material from salvagedpipe lines - while much of the scrap available from war-likestores (o.g. tanks) is alloy scrap, which can only be usedto a limited extent.IMPORTS4.      (a)    The main source must be Germany.    The United states were tho main pre-war Source but will now release no scrapfor export;    and may seek to obtain some German scrap.(b) Scrap from Germany comprises -(i)    Booty scrap (i.e. German war-like stores and plant).   This is removable by Mis Majesty1s government from the British zone without payment.   Total importsof booty scrap wore 270,000 tons in 1947:    in recent months the rate of import has reached 35,OCO tons amonth.    It is hoped to increase this to a rate of50,000 tons a month in tho near future.(ii)    Gorman shipj3.    Wherever possible these are-brought over to the United Kingdom for breaking up:ships aggregating registered tonnage of 90,000 tens(estimated to yield bO,000 tons of scrap) have alreadybeen brought over or arc in transit.(iii)    QOxVimorelal scrap.   Approximately l60, 000 tonsof commercial scrap was acquired in 1947*    The conclusionof extended contracts (it had been hoped to secure1 million tons in 1948) has been delayed mainly by german opposition and delaying tactics.    An importantcontributory cause is the lack of confidence in themarks    despite the offer of a high price the Germansprefer to hold scrap rather than sell it.   A contract for the suiply of 100,000 tons in the first quarterof 1948 has been agreed in principle&apos;by the german authorities but -chey still have to find scrap merchants prepared to execute it.*(c) The United States authorities are showingconsiderable interest in German scrap.   . It is probablethat further purchases of commercial scrap will be effectedon a joint United States-United Kingdom agency basis andthat imports will bo shared in an agreed proportion.Inasmuch as American pressure should help to secure increasedtotal scrap supplies from Germany at a reasonable price ttaisdevelopment is welcome, despite the need to divide scrapreceipts with the U.3.A. and certain European claimants(Benelux:    Italy:    Czechoslovakia).
(&amp;)   jh special United States riet&amp;l Scrap mission is utpresent examining scrap availabilities in Germany:    we aremaintaining liaison with this mission.      The Steel Sub-Committee of the Economic Commission&apos; for Europe proposes tosponsor the formation of a small team of experts to&apos;surveythe amount of old scrap available in Europe and the transport-labour and equipment needs required to maximise scraprecoveries.      We shall hope to take the lead in this survey and to arrange for close co-operation to b^ maintained with similar surveys which the United States authorities arcplanning in areas under their control or where United States-owned surpluses are still held.(e)    Every possible effort is being mode to securescrap supplies from countries abroad.(i) Far east the Colonial Office has been asked to arrangefor a special report on the position in singapore arid Penang where considerable quantitiesof scrap are said to have got into the hands ofa Chinese and Indian syndicate.(ii) Middle EastSome 300,000 tans of scrap have been shipped from the Middle East since June,  19-4-3-      It ishoped tj get further substantial tonnagesbut difficulties have arisen with the egyptian government over a proposed export tax of  10a ton,  and it may be necessary to agree that aconsiderable quantity of scrap will have to beleft in Egypt for local consumption.It is hjped to secure 33,000 tons of scrap from iraq.(iii) italy the Italian Government has undertaken to supply20,000 tons of scrap in 191+8 in considerationof their being allowed to retain for breaking up the &quot;Littorio&quot; class of battleship.(iv)&apos; MaltaSome 80,000 tons of scrap may be secured if itis possible to salvage a submerged floating dock and a number of sunken vessels inValetta harbour, but this is a long-termproject,  on which discussions are taking place with the Admiralty.GENERAL5. The scrap position will clearly continue to givecause for anxiety throughout 19*4-8 and in subsequent years.We may reasonably hope that a substantial portion of the&quot;gap&quot;  of aoproximately 1.1 million tons referred to inparagraph 2 will bo filled in 19*4-8 by the special collectionsfrom industry and from imports of booty scrap from Germany.But receiots from these sources are bound to diminish sharplyby,  say,  the end of 191+8,  and then our ability to obtain very
substantial tonnages of commercial scrap from Germany willbecome the key factor in the situation.      The Foreign Officeand the Control Commission are giving my Department full support - but the position is a very difficult one which is inevitably bound up with that of general political andeconomic conditions in Germany.I am glad tsteel industrial*y, while anxious, thatof the sense of urgency eitherimports - have assured me thatthat in the months immediately the low stocks available, willsteel production.say, however,  that the leaders of thetnere should be no lossas regards home supplies orthey are reasonably confidentahead scrap supplies, despitenot be a limiting factor inG.
