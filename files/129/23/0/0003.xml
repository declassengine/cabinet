___4Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1948REDISTRIBUTION OF seats memorandum by the Home secretary at the meeting of the Cabinet on 18th December (CM. (47) 96th Conclusions,Minute 5) I was invited to circulate a memorandum outlining a scheme fordividing into two constituencies each of the eight boroughs (Battersea, Blackburn,East Ham, Gateshead, Hammersmith, Norwich, Paddington and Reading)mentioned in the footnote to paragraph 25 of CP. (47) 338, together with astatement of the modifications in the representation proposed by the boundary commission for other constituencies which would have to be made if such ascheme were adopted.2. I circulate herewith a copy of the scheme for the division of the eightboroughs in question which was submitted to me unofficially by the deputy chairman of the Boundary Commission for England.3. It will be recalled that Rule 4 in the Third Schedule to the House ofCommons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1944, required that &quot; the electorate ofany constituency returning a single member shall not be greater or less than the electoral quota by more than approximately one quarter of the electoral quota.&quot;This requirement proved to be unsatisfactory in practice, in particular, because it involved the dismemberment of boroughs with electorates which, under this rule, were too large for one constituency and too small for two. accordingly the rules in the Third Schedule were amended by the Act of 1947 so as to remove any strict mathematical limit on the size of constituencies and to make the rule about approximate numerical equality subordinate to the rule requiring the integrity of local government areas to be preserved. It was clearly recognisedthat local unities could be preserved In this way only at the cost of more substantialinequalities of representation than were allowable under the original rules, andit was argued that many of the boroughs concerned would prefer under-representation to dismemberment.I discussed the proposed amendments of the rules with representatives ofthe Opposition in December 1946, and it was then agreed that the limits on the size of constituencies which would be acceptable in practice would be about30 per cent, below and 50 per cent, above the quota. The electorates of the eightboroughs in question fall practically within this upper limit. It was also agreedthat there should be some weighting in favour of rural constituencies at theexpense of urban constituencies.4. There is, therefore, nothing surprising in the Commission^ recommenda-tion with regard to these eight boroughs. They are the outstanding examples of the working out of the amended rules, but they are not the only examples.The Commission^ recommendations include a number of other undividedboroughs with electorates exceeding 70,000, some of them close on 80,000(e.g.: Dartford, 79,821, JLeyton, 79,587, and Twickenham, 79,818). Thus the division of the eight boroughs would by no means solve the problem and would bring up the fact that several other boroughs are little better off.5. The Commission^ recommendations also include three boroughs with three seats each (Bradford, Leicester and Nottingham) and two boroughs with34746CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.     31CP.

two seats each (Hackney and Stoke Newington, and Plymouth) in which theaverage electorate per constituency approximates to or exceeds 70,000. If the eight boroughs were divided it would be difficult to resist claims from these other boroughs, and from some of the boroughs referred to in paragraph above, for an additional seat each; this would still give the divided boroughsnamed above an average electorate per constituency of more than 50,000 exceptin the case of Plymouth. There are other divided boroughs with an averageelectorate per constituency exceeding 65,000.6. The Commission^ recommendations are based on a careful apportionmentof seats among the geographical counties. Concessions to the boroughs wouldupset this apportionment, besides tending to increase the total number of seats.They would also disturb the balance of representation between urban and ruralconstituencies to the disadvantage of the latter. The proper course at the momentappears to be to refuse any concession, and it is clear that any departure fromthe Commissioners&apos; recommendations must be made only after considering the consequential claims to which such action will give rise.J.
