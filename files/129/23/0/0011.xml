J 46IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&apos;SECRET COPY NO. ^CP. (U8)  115th January,  19U8.CABINET -TOURIST TRAVELMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate herewith for consideratiorXby mycolleagues two papers on Tourist Travel which haveVbeensubmitted by the Overseas Negotiations Committee.    \The first(Appendix I) sets out the considerations on which a decision should be based as to whether&apos; a resumption of tourist travelshould be permitted]  . and the second (Appendix II) makesrecommendations about the arrangements which might be made if it is decided that it should be resumed.2. I recommend that authority be given for departments to proceed as proposed in Appendix II.3- As regards timing,  the Governments of Eire and canada must bo given advance notice and the announcement should therefore not be made until a few days after the decision hasbeen taken.      A delay of a few days will not affect the starting date.      I have considered whether it is possible tomake the starting date uarlier than 1st May.      In view,however,  of the fact that some of the negotiations may be delayed and the pressure of work that will fall on the exchange control,  the Customs and Immigration staffs and on the Banks,any attempt to advance the date might easily result in serious administrative difficulties which would prejudice the successof the scheme.      I am therefore satisfied that the date cannotsafely be advanced.R. S. C 4Treasury Chambers,  S.W.1.5th January, 19-U-8.
APPENDIX ITOURIST TRAVELMemorandum by the Overseas Ncgotiating CommitteeThe Overseas Negotiating Committee has considered thequestion of tourist travel and the possibility of its beingresumed some time in 192+6,      The Committee was told that theForeign Secretary was concerned at the number of reprcsenta-tions which he had received regarding the ban on personaltravel to destinations outside the Sterling Area.      such representations had been made by the Governments of France,Sweden, Switzerland and Norway, all of which attached much importance to the British Tourist traffic,2,      Details of the sums involved in foreign travel, bothpersonal and business, during the twelve months up to -September, 191+7, are given in the Annex to this memorandum.Personal travel accounted for about  32 millions, not all of which can be broken up by destinations;    but a sufficientguide to the break-up is given by the currencies actuallymade available to travellers.    This was  29.2 millions in all.,of which  9 millions went to Switzerland,  6.6 millions toFrance,  3*8 millions to Belgium  3 millions to the UnitedStates,  1,1). millions to Canada and  1.3 millions to Italy.511).,960 travel forms were handled from April to September, 19k7;the average amount of each personal travel form was  1+3.3,      &quot;The Committee recognised that there were many factorsoutside the balance of payments questions which are their concern, which are relevant to the maintenance or relaxation of the present ban, e, g,  on the one hand its harmful effect in the field of foreign relations, the inherent uncles ira-bility of preventing foreign travel and the fact that theban goes contrary to the spirit of international co-operatio-nwhich is the basis of the European Recovery Programme;    onthe other hand the variation in the impact of the ban on different sections of the population, the difficulty ofmaintaining other austerities in the face of any relaxation in this field and the psychological effect of a relaxationon the export drive.      The Committee, while recognising thatthese factors exist, has not considered them in any detail and makes no recommendation on the maintenance or relaxation of the ban.     This memorandum is confined to (a) an examinationof the economic aspects of the question, and (b) recommenda-tions on the procedure which might be adopted if it is decidedthat it can be relaxed.Economic Aspects^U,      We could not recommend any relaxation that -(a) did    not get us equivalent advantages in return; or(b) cost us dollars or gold,5*      Sooner or later,  in one farm or another, we have to pay for tourist traffic;    we should aim,  therefore,  at gettingadvantages which pay for the traffic and leave us something in hand as well.    This should be our aim over the field as awhole and particularly with hard-currency countries, of whichSwitzerland is the chief example.    We can strike easierbargains with countries with which we have no balance ofpayments difficulties.
6i     To accomplish this aim, we must he able to discriminate -to make money available for travel to one country &quot;but not toanother.     This is practically possible, within limits, but itmight cause political difficulties unless it is justified on some clear principle.     y/e suggest that we should announce thatwe should like to reopen personal travel but that we cannot afford to do so if this is going to cost gold or dollars or ifthere is no compensating advantage from the other side.     Weshould stand ready to negotiate on this basis with any countryand would balance up the economic return which they could make.7.      On this basis wo would negotiate with the most difficultcountries first - Switzerland, and Belgium for example.      Y/ecould then fill in the. gaps on easier terms where we felt Ionsdifficulty.      In practice,  once we start relaxing the ban,it will be difficult to hold out for any country in western europe unless their -currency is demonstrably hard and theyhave refused to make us a reasonable offer.8.     Our bargaining power is a wasting asset.     Many couutr:.. 3are very anxious to see us retore foreign travel at an earlydate.      But they know and we know that the ban will not gofor ever;    and the longer that we delay trading our favours,the less we shall got for them.9.      We should not formally exclude the United States, canada and the other dollar countries from our offer.     But we know that they could make us no adequate offer, nor is our tour isttraffic important enough to them to tempt the:;; to try.10.    We consider that reciprocity should bo demanded onlyin the sense that we would, not conclude an agreement with any country which banned travel to this country.      But we shouldnot go further;    reciprocity in the sense of equality of theper caput allowance or the total expenditure is not apractical proposition.11.    It is administratively impracticable to discriminatein the amount per head which we allow tour tourists to different countries.      We do not dissent from the Treasury viewthat the allowance should be  55 per head per annum with aproportionately smaller allowance for children.Procedure12.    It is too late to do anything about this winter&apos;straffic. &apos;   If the ban is to be lifted in time for the 1948summer season an announcement ought probably to be made not later than February in order that the travel agencies could make arrangements.    If the matter gees forward, the precisedate could be settled in consultation with the agencies.13.    In the light of this we have considered hew negotiations could best be opened.      We do not consider that negotiationswith foreign countries could be kept secret.      On the othurhand a series of separate and unco-ordinated announcementsas agreement was reached with each country would be mostconfusing and would make it difficult for people to fix theirholidays&quot;. -   We therefore suggest that if it is decided to relaxthe ban the Government should make an early announcementsaying that they are prepared to consider proposals from othercountries to this end and setting cut the basis on which theywould, do so.     The statement would then say that a final
mannouncement regarding the countries to whom the scheme would apply would &quot;be made in February;    particular agreements rciirht:or might net have tc be announced meanwhile, but the public would know that it could expect a final list of countries &quot;bya given date.Conclusions14.    We recommend that, if it is decided that tourist trafficshould be resumed in 1948;-(a) this should he dene on the basis that we should ex; ectdefinite advantages in return;(b) the  traffic should net &quot;be resumed with any country where it might involve us in the loss of gold ordollars;(c) His Majesty&apos;s Government should announce at an car. ydate that they arc prepared to consider proposals from any country for the resumption of tourist traffic with it on this basis,  and that a list ofthe, countries to whom the scheme will apply in1948 will be published net later than February.November,  19h7.

appendix  iiTOURIST TRAVELMemorandum by the Overseas Negotiations Committee1. If it is decided,  in the light of B.P. (O.N.) (1+7) 115and of the developing economic situation, to provide exchange for tourist travel in 191+3, wo should advise the following arrangements :-(l)    A basic travel ration of  35 for adults and  25 for children under 16, available for all countries within theschorno within the twelve months beginning 1st Mayili 191+3.(2)    The ration to be available through banks and approvedtravel agencies doing foreign exchange business, mainly intravellers&apos; cheques or similar instruments.   We should try toavoid the unhappy Swiss experiment in 191+7 of vouchers cashable(in theory) for certain purposes only.    The exchange issuedwould be recorded (as previously) in the traveller&apos;s passport,as a safeguard against double drawing.(3) The present facilities for booking return passagesby direct routes to foreign destinations, against payment in sterling in London, would continue, and would be outside the basic ration.2. The scheme above represents in substance a return t 1that oporating in September 1947.    It is familiar to bank andtravel agency staffs, and. would thus involve the minimum of friction.   The date is advised because it lies between theseasons, and also because it will reduce the cost.    An earlic rdate is barely practicable, with all that has to be done:    alater would be unpalatable to the holiday countries.   But air-scheme which involved a major departure from the old familiarpattern would probably take longer to introduce, and would a^J.unnecessarily in our opinion to the severe load, on the Excha: geControl and its agents.3. Scope of . t he so home. B.P. (O.N.) (1+7) 115s suggestedthat &quot;we should announce that we should like to reopen personaltravel but that we cannot afford to do so if this is going tcost gold or dollars or if there is no compensating advantage from the other side.   We should stand ready to negotiate onthis basis with any country and would balance up the economicreturn which they could make&quot;.   A draft of the first amouncu-ment is  annexed.     It is desirable that it should not(a) encourage false hopes;(b) tie us to any rigid formula governing the type ofcompensating advantage which is adequate;(c) force on us any elaborate machinery for computingand sterilising the sterling accruing as the consequence of our tourists;(d) prevent us from allowing travel to the many oddplaces which do not matter at all;x     Appendix I
^93 k3(c)    involve us in controversy with the dollar countries;.(f)    encourage negotiations which concentrate on inducingus to amend cur scheme.   .Thc scheme must &quot;be uniformfor all the countries whom wc cover, or we shallget into serious administrative difficulty.(Ultimately we ore at the mercy of the counterstaff dealing with travellers).The draft announcement is vague as regards the dollar countries, though categorical in stating that we cannot affordany drain on our gold and dollars.    It is conceivable in theory but utterly unlikely that the dollar countries could make tourism possible for cur people without adding to our dollar burden, and arguable therefore that the door shouldbe left open at this stage (cf paragraph y of Appendix I)*The draft also does not refer to the clauses in seme of ourmonetary agreements which involve us in gold payments v/hon asterling &quot;ceiling&quot; is reached.   But it must be a main issue in   the negotiations that we do not add such a country to the list unless wo are sure that the overall settlement will infact mean that gold payments will not arise.    It also toucheolightly on the question of reciprocity, but wc do not suggestthat this should mean identical provision.h.. It is of course important that we should not issue the first announcement,  raising many hopes, without considering(see paragraph 5) the probabilities of reaching agreement withthe principal holiday countries.   Any failure with a majorcountry would divert the flow of tourists to other countries and tend to upset the calculations of coot and risk.    unfortunately the latest figures of the balance of payments between the sterling area and Switzerland afford very slender hope that any provisionfor tourism could be squeezed in.   V/e do not think v/e could make any private bargain with the Swiss which was to our advantage, because - all else apart - to reach a good settlementwe shall need publicity and the resulting pressure of the Swisshotel industry on their government.5. We think the probabilities, as regards the mainEuropean countries, arc as followsPrance Already safe - the French will usespare sterling to retire debt due tous in 1951 and later.SwitzerlandNegotiations on trade and financebegin on ,15th January.    There is littlemargin to play with and we cannot besure that we can arrange for tourist traffic within the conditions laiddown.   But it means a lot to the Swissand they may be able to offeracceptable terms.Belgium and LuxembourgAgreement unlikely. V/e should awaittheir proposals, if any.Holland and DenmarkNo risks - chronically short ofsterlingsNorway and SwedenTourism both ways is probably in balance:    amount at stake small.
ItalyAustriaCzechoslovakiaGreeceFinlandSpainPortugalYugoslaviaNegotiations begin 12th January andthis card might be useful, but thereare no obvious grounds for optimism.Amount involved small and risknegligible, unless major countriesdrop out of the picture.It will be necessary in due course to reach a decision aboutmany other countries, not because holidaymakers from theUnited Kingdom would frequent them, but because(a) our scheme should if possible apply comfortablyfor the rest of the sterling area, and(b) the basic ration covers not only holiday requirementsbut all the odd reasons for travel - sick relativespersonal business affairs, visits to graves, and&quot;pocket money&quot; of all varieties.It looks,  however,  as .though most of Europe could be expectedto fall into the scheme. A decision on the issue of principle is immediatelynecessary.    But there is no time to spare,  since negotiationswith Italy begin on 12th January and with the Swiss on 15thJanuary.    The balance of advantage seems to lio in an announco-ment of policy (as annexed)  about the 10th January, ratherthan to wait for Parliament to reassemble,  as it would hardly be possible to play this long in the negotiations or to keepintentions secret, even if it paid us to do so.   The resultingtimetable is thus ; -10th January1st March or assoon after aspossibleUp to 1st AprilIssue statement of willingness tonegotiate, and inform countrieslikely to be materially affected.(Also give guidance to sterling area).Publish details of agreements asconcluded.Publish comprehensive list of countries covered, and (within next week) issue detailed instructions tobanks and travel agencies.Further countries could be added,with effect from opening date.1st MayOpening date.
7.     Cost.   As already noted, the estimate for any country would he falsified if some major centre remained closed,.Subject to this,  it seems reasonable to assume a gross cost(i.e, without allowing for tourists from those countries)about two-thirds of 191+7 costs, when tine ration was  (5 outthe average amount drawn was in the neighbourhood of  50..On that basis the costs would be 000Switzerland6,0004,5002,6001,000FranceBelgiumItalyNetherlandsSwedenOtherssay6005501,000 16,250January, 191+8
DRAFT OF FIRST ANNOUNCEMENTL His Majesty&apos;s Government are very unwilling to continuisny longer than necessary restrictions on foreign travel which33ke it more difficult for their own people to get to know andunderstand the people of other countries.      They are also anxiouG[to carry out to the fullest possible extent the policy containedin the report on European Economic Co-operation of removingieconomic barriers between the participating countries and the obstacles to the free movement of persons within Europe.      Therestoration of a   measure of foreign travel will contribute tothis main objective.      But it must bo mode clear at once thatEis Majesty&apos;s Government cannot afford any drain on the resourcesjf gold and dollars for anything which is not strictly necessary.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government have,  therefore,  decided to investigate the possibilities of providing foreign exchange forforeign travel during the year,  starting on 1st May,  19h-8,  tothose countries with which they con make satisfactory arrangements.The allowance could,/exceed the rate of  35 8 person for the yearand  25 a year for children under 16.      His Majesty&apos;s government can afford the exchange o; I / if they can be satisfied in thecase of each country that there is no risk of losing gold ordollars and that this country&apos;s commercial and financial arrangements will not suffer as a consequence.      They would alsoexpect the countries concerned to moke it possible for theircitizens to visit the United Kingdom.3* Negotiations with several countries are in progressor in prospect,  the results of which will,  it is hoped, be satisfactory to both sides.      The final list of countries towhich the scheme will apply will be issued about the beginning0f March so as to allow people to moke their plans for the summer.
