(48) 2723a  January, 1948CABINETPAST AND PROSPECTIVE WAGES MOVEMENTSMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service. At the meeting of the Cabinet on 13th November (CM. (47) 87th Conclu-sions, Minute 5) I was invited to circulate a memorandum &quot; giving information about past and prospective wage movements in relation both to the general economic situation and the needs of the undermanned essential industries, anddealing with the suggestion that the Government should adopt a more positivewages policy in cases where claims for increased wages were made by employees of Public Boards and Local Authorities or where the grant of a wages claimwould involve an additional charge on the Exchequer.&quot;2. I attach a memorandum dealing with the general trend of wages from1939 to the end of 1947 and the likely movement of wages in the immediate future,in which special reference is made to the undermanned essential industries. Iam circulating a separate memorandum dealing with the suggestion that theGovernment should adopt a more positive wages policy in the cases referred toin the Cabinet Conclusion.3.   The main conclusions of the attached memorandum are as follows : (a) From 1939 to the end of 1947 wages rates have continuously increased and, except for two short periods between 1939 and April 1947,earnings nave also increased. In December 1947 weekly wage rates were 73 per cent, higher than in September 1939; in April 1947average weekly earnings were 94 per cent, higher than in October1938.(6) After the end of the war, from mid-1945 to mid-1946, there was a rapidrise in weekly wage rates as a result of the conclusion of post-war wage settlements in industry as a whole. This was followed by ayear of comparative stability, mid-1946 to mid-1947, in weekly wage rates. But during this same period in most industries normal working hours were reduced from an average of about 48 to about 44 a week,without in most cases reduction in the weekly rate of wages.(c) There is good evidence to show that the desire to reduce normal working hours has been satisfied for the time being, and that any movement for further reductions is not likely to be serious in the immediatefuture.(d) A second post-war wage movement, which is likely to result in a general increase in wage rates, started about mid-1947 and has made consider-able progress.
(e) The rate at which wages will increase in this movement is likely to becomparable with tne rate of increase reflected by the post-warsettlements of mid-1945 to mid-1946.(J) It would not be safe to count on this present movement being followedby a period of stability of any length. There seems to be a distinctpossibility that the&apos; socialised industries may give a lead to otherindustries by granting further wage increases in the future.(g) Relative wage rates and earnings have changed substantially between1939 and the end of 1947, and in general this change has been favour-able to the important undermanned industries, particularly those inwhich the work is hard and heavy, e.g., agriculture and coal-mining.Thus, in a selection of twenty-three important industries shown inTable 1 of Appendix I underground coal-mining wages rose fromtwentieth to first place, surface coal-mining wages rose from twenty-second to third place, and agricultural wages rose from twenty-thirdto eighth place. When the present movement is complete it may befound that these industries will again show changes in their positions;but there is no doubt that the tendency is continuing for the previouslyundermanned essential industries like coal-mining and agriculture toshow improvements relative to other industries.(h) There has been a marked tendency towards equalisation of rates and earnings as between different industries, different grades in each industry, and men and women. This is to some extent, no doubt, theresult of pressure of economic circumstances, but it is also the resultof a conscious movement in industry which is part of the more generalmovement in many fields for greater social equality.G.

annex memorandum by the Ministry of Labour and National ServicePast and Prospective Wage MovementsGeneral Trend of Wages from September 1939 to December 19471. Wage Rates. On the basis of wage rates in September 1939 the rate of increase has been as follows : Index Mo. representingEnd of level of rates of wages      Increase in points(Sept. 1939=100)*June 1940   ,.......	109	June 1941    ........	122	13June 1942    ........	129	7June 1943    ........	136	7June 1944    ........	143	7June 1945   ........	149	6June 1946   ........	161	12December 1946	165\	KJune 1947    ........	166 J	0December 1947	173	7(This movement is illustrated in Appendix IV.)2. There has been a continuous rise in wage rates throughout the period butthe rate of rise has varied. There was a relatively high rate of increase betweenSeptember 1939 and June 1941 which reflected the wage adjustments consequent on the change in the general economic position from one of under-employment to general labour shortage and the rapid expansion of the munitions industries.From June 1941 to the end of the war-mid-1945, the rate of increase was lower,following the stabilisation of the cost-of-living index figure. Though the stabilisation policy slowed down the rate of increase, it did not arrest increasesaltogether and adjustments in wage rates were made to meet the continued risein prices during these years, which was not reflected in the cost-of-living figure.The main features of the movement in wages from mid-1941 to mid-1945 are theregular approximately yearly cycles of increases and the remarkable steadinessof the rate of increase. The level of increase in each movement was to a great extent determined by the awards of the National Arbitration Tribunal in certainkey industries and, in the circumstances of war, industry as a whole showed ageneral readiness to follow the lead given by these awards. There was thus acomparatively clear pattern in the general process and as a result a consciousnessof the relation between rates, claims and increases in different industries wasdeveloped to a much greater degree than before the war. In the year after theend of the war and particularly during the first half of 1946 the rate at whichwages increased was relatively high compared with the preceding four years andwas comparable with the high rate of increase between September 1939 and june 1941.  In the twelve months after June 1946 the rate again decreased.3. The post-war trend from June 1945 deserves closer examination. the rapid rise in the first half of this period reflects the conclusion of post-war settle-ments over the greater part of industry. These settlements were made in the atmosphere of the immediate post-war period when there was a general expectation, shared by both sides of industry, that the difficulties of economicreconstruction would be overcome with a progressive easing of restrictions andshortages and a steadily improving standard of life. In this atmosphere bothsides of industry sought to reach agreements to provide a period of stability onthe basis of expectations which have since been disappointed as a result of the continuation of economic difficulties in this country and abroad.  The settlements* In calculating the index of wage rates industries are &apos;&apos; weighted &quot; in accordance withthe proportions in which each industry contributed to the pre-war wages bill of all industries.The figure may not therefore be absolutely correct but it is sufficiently reliable to serve as a guide. A new index, with more accurate weighting, is in the course of preparation and is thesubject of discussion with the National Joint Advisory Council.
were on a generous scale compared with war-time settlements and seemed intendednot only to compensate for the increase in the cost of living (which it wasconsidered had not been adequately met by the war-time increases) but also torecognise the claim for higher standards for the workers. The rate of increase was particularly rapid partly because the ending of the war, which by a reductionin overtime brought a fall in the pay packet, precipitated a very large numberof major adjustments within a short period of time. In the second half ofthe period June 1946 to June 1947, when the rate of increase was relatively low,the rise largely reflected the need for comparatively minor adjustments as betweenindustries arising from the major settlements in the earlier period. During thisperiod also there was a widespread movement to reduce the length of the normal working week without reduction of the weekly rate. Thus while the weekly rates were not affected the hourly rate was increased, and also earnings to the extent that the existing aggregate working week was maintained. Since June 1947wage rates have again risen more rapidly as a result of wage increases in aconsiderable number of industries. The significance and implications of this development are considered more fully in the paragraphs dealing with prospectivewage movements.4. Average Earnings. On the basis of average weekly earnings in indus-tries covered by the Ministry of Labour enquiries* in October 1938 average earnings between 1938 and 1947 have risen as follows : Date1940 July1941 July1942 January1942 July1943 Januarv1943 July1944 January1944 July1945 January1945 July1946 January1946 July1946 October1947 AprilPercentageincrease over 19383042466065767982768074899094The percentage rise in earnings from October 1938 to April 1947 is greater thanthe percentage rise in wage rates between 1939 and mid-1947 94 per cent, ascompared with 66 per cent, in industry generally, and 60-61 per cent, in theindustries covered by the enquiries but account should be taken of the differentdates from which the two estimates start. Figures of average weekly earnings are not available for any date between October 1938 and July 1940 but betweenOctober 1938 and September 1939 industrial activity increased greatly and itcan be assumed that by September 1939 earnings were already substantially above the figure of October 1938. The rates of increase of wages and earnings between September 1939 and mid-1947, therefore, are probably not markedlydifferent. Average earnings rose more rapidly than rates during 1942 and1943 when wage rates were increasing comparatively slowly, fell in the second half of 1944 and the second half of 1945, while rates were continuing to rise,but have risen more rapidly than wage rates since the end of 1946. (For therelative rates at which earnings and wage rates have increased see Appendix IV.)5. The fall in the pay packets of the workers, represented by the declinein average earnings from the war-time peak of July 1944, particularly fromthe end of the war to January 1946, is one explanation of the demand forincreased wage rates in the immediate post-war period. Workers may well have feared that this fall was liable to continue and increased rates were soughtas an assurance of a pay packet on a level comparable with their war-timeearnings, which were considered to be not unduly above pre-war earnings inrelation to the rise which there had been in the cost of living.* The Ministry of Labour enquiries cover the principal manufacturing industries and some important non-manufaeturing industries, excluding agriculture, coalmining, railways, dock labour,and the distributive trades.
6. The reduction in the normal working week referred to in paragraph above has resulted in an increase in the hourly rate over a wide range of industries,and, in the industries suffering from shortage of man-power, in more overtimeworking based on the enhanced rates. This may have been one of the objects of the movement but undoubtedly a major objective was to guard against thetime when opportunities for overtime might no longer be available. It may besaid with some confidence that the difficulties arising from shortage of materials and dislocation following the fuel crisis were successfully surmounted withoutlabour troubles in part at least because of the psychological value of the increasedhourly rates. On the other hand the increased hourly rates and overtime earningsmay well have meant increases in production costs, which were to some extentreflected in higher prices, e.g., coal.Relative movements of wages, with particular reference to the undermannedindustries from September 1939 to midM9477. In considering this problem it seems desirable to take account of (a)the minimum rates in different industries and particularly the important under-manned industries in comparison with others at December 1947 as comparedwith September 1939, so far as it is possible to calculate and compare minimumtime rates in different industries, (6) the rate of increase in wage rates in different industries, particularly the important undermanned industries over the period as compared with the rate for industry in general as set out in paragraph 1, and(c) the movement of average earnings in different industries over the period.It is not possible for a variety of reasons to provide comprehensive statistical information covering the whole of industry on these aspects of the problem butAppendix I contains tables illustrating (i) minimum wage rates for men and women in selected industries in1939 and 1947;(ii) the rate of increase in wage rates in certain undermanned industriesbetween 1939 and 1947;(iii) average earnings of men and women in selected industries in 1938 and1947;(iv) the comparative rates of wages of skilled and unskilled men in 1939and 1947; and(v) the minimum rates fixed by the Wages Councils.8. The relativities which existed between wage rates in different industriesbefore the war have substantially changed between 1939 and 1947. Coalminingis a striking example. In a selection of industries given in Appendix I Table 1,the lowest rates of underground miners have moved up from the 20th place inthe table to the first place, and the lowest rates for surface workers from the22nd place to the third place. Similarly agriculture has moved up from the 23rdplace (the lowest in the table) to eighth place. These fairly represent the generalflexibility and change of relative rates of industry as a whole during the period.9. In general the change in relative wage rates has been in favour of theimportant undermanned industries and particularly in favour of those such as agriculture and coalmining where the work is heavy and the conditions of work are less attractive than in industry generally. The table giving percentage increases in wage rates in the important undermanned industries in Appendix it able 3 shows that the rates in the majority of these industries have increased as rapidly or more rapidly than the average wage rate between 1939 and 1947,the rate of increase in agriculture being particularly rapid.10. This is, of course, a tendency one would expect to see in circumstancesof full employment which result in&apos; shortages of labour and of basic raw materials.On the other hand it is right to bear in mind that we are in the middle of anotherupward movement in wage rates, that coalmining and agriculture were among thefirst to have improvements during this movement, and that when the presentmovement is complete there may be further changes in the relative positions of thedifferent industries. Nevertheless, the tendency of the movement since June 1947seems to indicate that industries like coalmining and agriculture will continueto show an improvement relative to other industries.11. The gap between wage rates in the highly paid and lowly paidindustries has become smaller. In the industries of which details are given inAppendix I Tables 1 and 2 the highest and lowest minimum rates for men in 1939were 71s. Qd. and 32s.; in December 1947 they were 115s. and 78s. lOd.; for women
they were in 1939 38s. and 15s., and in December 1947 66s. and 50s. 5d. Therehas thus been a strong tendency towards equalisation during the period; and thecraps may well be smaller when the present cycle of increases is complete. Thetendency towards equalisation is shown also in the change in the relative rateswithin particular industries. For example, the lower rates for unskilled men have improved relatively to the higher skilled rates (see Appendix I Table 6).In general the rate for unskilled men as a percentage of the rate for skilled men was about 75 to 80 per cent, in 1939 and 80 to 85 per cent, in 1947.12. In general an examination of the trend of earnings in industry reinforcesthe conclusions in the preceding paragraphs based on an examination of themovement in wage rates. The relativity of earnings in different industries has changed substantially between 1939 and 1947 and generally this change hasfavoured the important undermanned industries. Earnings m coalmining wnichwere comparatively low in 1939 were in April 1947 among the highest Theaverage earnings of men in the cotton industry have risen much more rapidly thanaverage earnings in industry generally, though some allowance must be madefor the fact that in 1938 the industry was adversely affected by trade depression.Women&apos;s earnings in the main textile industries and pottery have risen more rapidly than the average women&apos;s earnings in industry generally. The tendency towards equalisation is also apparent. The gap between earnings in the higher paid and lower paid industries has become smaller, and in industry generallywomen&apos;s earnings which are lower than men&apos;s earnings, have increased more thanmen&apos;s earnings.   (See Appendix I Tables 4 and 5).Prospective Wage Movements13. The future trend of wages will, of course, be strongly influenced, insome circumstances indeed it could be largely determined by the way inwhich the economic situation develops. The views expressed in this memorandum as&apos;to future wage movements are based on the assumption that the main financialand economic features of the present situation will continue substantially unchanged and that there will be no developments in the near future which willradically change the attitude of employers or workers towards wages, or their relative bargaining power. It is assumed that the upward tr,end of prices whichhas continued during the past eight years is likely to persist at a comparable rate,but not that there will be any acceleration in the process to cause a sharp upward movement of the Index of Retail Prices. Such a movement would be followedby the strongest pressure throughout industry for immediate wage increases on a scale thought necessary to meet the burden of increased prices. In thesecircumstances the appreciation of the situation given below would be inadequate.Nor would it hold good if, for example, there were any substantial decline fromthe present level of industrial activity and employment or if our prices provedsuch a serious obstacle to exports that manufacturers were under effective pressure to reduce their costs of production. So far as wages are concerned the most significant feature of the present economic situation is that the expectations onwhich the post-war settlements were based have been proved false (see para-graph 3). Restrictions and shortages have continued longer than was anticipated,prices have gone on rising, and the future is still, in many respects, uncertain.The general economic stability which industry looked forward to in 1945 has notyet been achieved, and there is a feeling that economic developments haveimpaired the value of the post-war improvements in conditions of employment aslong-term settlements which would ensure industrial stability, and have renderedthem inadequate. There is considerable pressure throughout industry for a revision of these settlements.14. A general indication of the probable results of this pressure can beobtained from an examination of developments from the end of the war to mid-1947. As already indicated, while there was in that period a general increasein wage rates throughout industry, wages did not rise at a steady rate during thetwo years. In the period immediately after the end of the war there was acomparatively sharp rise in the index of weekly wage rates, followed by a periodoi stability, when reductions in the normal working week were being introduced in most industries. It is significant, however, that during the whole period therehas been sustained and successful pressure to obtain improvements in the termsof employment and if a high level of industrial activity with full employment ismaintained in the immediate future, this pressure will undoubtedly continue
The important question is.the direction in which it will be exerted. There is goodevidence that the desire to reduce normal working hours in industry has been satisfied and in the present atmosphere it is most unlikely that any movement forfurther reductions will become serious. Such pressure for improved terms ofemployment as may show itself is likely to be directed towards obtaining increases in the pay packet. The paragraphs below examine the present wages positionand movements in the immediate past with a view to determining to what extentthere is evidence to confirm this general conclusion.15. A list of the more important industries in which there have been wage increases since July 1947 and a brief indication of the increases is given inAppendix II. These increases affect more than four million workpeople and thuscover a very considerable proportion of the total numbers employed in industryand services. The fact that increases have been granted over such a wide fieldwill, it can be assumed, strengthen the case for increases in those industries whereclaims are now being negotiated, and lead to increased pressure for the submission of claims in industries which have not received an increase in recent months andhave not recently submitted a claim.16. Some of the increases, particularly those in agriculture, building andcoalmining are likely to be of special importance in relation to future claims inother industries. Agriculture was for many years before 1939 a comparativelylowly paid industry and workers and employers in many other industries, recog-recognising this, assumed that their own wage rates would be substantially higher.The figures of relative increases between 1939 and 1947 show that this attitude as to the relationship between agriculture and other industries has been substan-tially changed, but it cannot be said to have been eradicated. The effect of theagricultural increase in August last has already been shown in wage increases ina number of rural industries and trades, e.g., roadmen, milk distribution, sugar-beet processing, land drainage; there is evidence of its having some effects onindustries not directly related to agriculture, e.g., the relation between theminimum rates in agriculture and the boot and shoe industry was one of the argu-ments put forward last August by the union in the latter industry for proceeding with their claim in spite of the Prime Ministers appeal of 6th August. Theincrease in the building industry has been followed by an increase in civil engineering; it is likely to have a direct effect on the building materials industries and be followed by an upward movement of wages in them, and to react on otherindustries, e.g., shipbuilding. The increase in coalmining may stimulate claims for increases. After the award of a  5 a week minimum in coalmining in 1944 anumber of unions took this figure as the objective to be gained in their own industries and  5 a week became a significant figure in the claims presented in theperiod immediately after the end of the war. The increase above this minimum rate in coalmining may therefore have general repercussions in industry thoughthe special position of coalmining is now more widely recognised.17. Negotiations on claims for wage increases are at present proceeding ina considerable number of industries and a list of the more important of them isgiven in Appendix III attached. The Appendix also shows industries in which,though there is no formal claim for increased wages under negotiation, there arelikely to be developments, which may lead to wage increases in the near future.(The list is not exhaustive. Some comparatively small and unimportant industries have been omitted, and there may be some claims of which this Department is notinformed, which are not included.) It is, of course, impossible to say what the outcome of the negotiations on any one of these claims is likely to be, but it islikely that in the immediate future the outstanding claims for increases will be met,at least in part. It is difficult to estimate the repercussions on other industries ofthe present negotiations and the settlements which will be reached, but again it islikely that claims will continue to be put forward probably by a wide range ofindustries.18. Wage rates have been rising more rapidly since the middle of 1947 andit is likely that they will continue to rise in the immediate future. The increasessince mid-1947 viewed in relation to developments from mid-1945 to mid-1947suggest that in fact a second post-war movement in industry to obtain increases in wage rates has made considerable progress. Two vitally important considera-tions arise from this general conclusion : (a) at what rate are wages likely to rise in this movement;(b) is this movement likely to be followed by a period of stability.
19. It is extremely difficult to indicate even in general terms the rate atwhich wages will rise, but some very general conclusions can be drawn from anestimate of the wages cost of the increases granted since July and an examinationof the actual increases granted in particular industries. So far as can beestimated, the rate of increase during the movement which is now in progress is not likely to be higher than the rate of increase between mid-1945 and 1946,nor is it likely to be significantly lower.20. No firm view can be given as to the possibility of the present movementbeing followed by a period of stability. It is important to note, however, thatthere are factors in the present situation which may well be a source of disturbancein the comparatively near future. The recent agreement in the building industrycontemplates a period of stability continuing only until February 1949. Inagriculture, where there have been three wage increases since the war, it cannotbe said with confidence that no further claim will be made in the near future.The recent wage increases in the coalmining industry were in the nature of an&quot; interim &quot; settlement, and both sides of the industry are committed to undertake a revision of the wages structure; even if this is not undertaken in the near future the expiry of the present overtime agreement in April 1948 may lead to some difficulty over wages. The railway industry are pledged to overhaul their wagesstructure. In other nationalised industries the question of wage improvementsmay well be among the first tasks set the new Boards. There is no doubt thatthe increases given in the coalmining industry have stimulated demands for higher wages in other industries, and there seems to be a distinct possibility thatthe socialised industries are likely to be giving a lead to other industries bygranting further wage increases in the future.APPENDIX it able 1.-Minimum Weekly Time Rates of Wages of Adult Men in CertainSelected Industries in September 1939 and December 1947IndustrySeptember   31st Decem-1939        her, 19471.
