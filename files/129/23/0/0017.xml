ANNEXOBSERVATIONS OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT ON the interim REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY INTO TUDORAIRCRAFTj1. The Government consider it desirable to give some indication of their viev/s on the main conclusions andrecommendations contained in the Interim Report of theCommittee of Enquiry into Tudor Aircraft.2. The Report relates to events occurring between19U3 and the summer of 19h7.      Some of the points criticised by the Committee were the result of wartime conditions andin the early stages the general development of the project was affected by the necessary preoccupation of all concernedwitti military requirements.      The criticisms made of.0.A.C.&apos;s internal organisation and their relations withthe constructors also relate mainly to a period when theCorp oration&apos; s organisation was on a wartime basis or intransition to a peacetime basis.3&apos; A number of changes have been made in theorganisation of the Corporation with a view to increasing its efficiency^      The procedure for the ordering of aircraftv/as altered as long ago as September,  19h-6,  and in contractsplaced since that date the Corporations take full financial responsibility for the aircraft ordered to meet their statedrequirements.      In addition, the Civil Aircraft requirements committee, of which Sir Henry Self was first chairman, was formed in 19h-6.      This Committee consists of representativesof the Ministries of Civil Aviation and Supply, the treasury and the three Airways corporations and associates the latter,from the inception, with the responsibility for formulatingthe requirements and performance specifications of new aircrafttypes.      The present organisation is,  therefore, more satisfactory than that disclosed in the Report, but theGovernment, are, nevertheless,  endeavouring to improve it.!;. A Tudor I aircraft incorporating a number of improvements found to be desirable during the developmentof the type is due to undergo its final trials in the nextfew weeks.      Discussions ere now proceeding with .B.O.A.C.  onthe basis that, if these trials show that the type meets thespecifications originally laid down and a Certificate ofAir-worthiness is granted,  the Tudor I,  suitably modified asregards seating accommodation, will be brought into service as may best fit in with the programme of development of theCorporation^ services.      No special subsidy will be paidoutside the provisions of the Civil Aviation Act,  19h&amp;*
