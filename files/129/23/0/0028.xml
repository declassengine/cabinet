(14-8) 2823rd January, 19h8.Copy No.&apos; &quot;513--v4CABINETWAGES policy memorandum b:/ the Minister of Labour and national service as requested by the Cabinet at their meeting on13th November, 19h7,   (C.M.(h7) 87th Conclusions, Minute 5)I am circulating a memorandum on past and prospective wagemovements.      In the present memorandum I deal, in response to the further request of the Cabinet, with the suggestionthat the Government should adopt a more positive wages policy in cases where claims for increased wages ore madeby employees of Public Boards and local authorities or wherethe grant of a wages claim would involve an additional charge on the Exchequer.      Before dealing with this specific questionI should like to mention two important developments on thegeneral question of wages policy which have token place since our last discussion on 13th November.2. The Trades Union Congress issued on 31st December,I9J4.7,  their Interim Report on the Economic Situation.      Inmy view the T.U.C.  in this report display considerablecourage,  enjoining as they do upon members and leaders oftrade unions that they should show caution,  restraint and 0sense of responsibility in wages negotiations.      Or. the otherhand the T.U.C.  express themselves as completely opposed tothe imposition of specific limits and restrictions on wage increases and to the establishment of machinery for thepurpose of controlling wages.      The attitude of the T.U.Con this question is in my view conclusive.3. Within the lost few days the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs has proposed thot in eur foreign publicitywe should go over to the offensive against Communism end that the main feature of such action on our part should beto show that the way of life of a social-democratic State is far superior to life in a communistic or authoritarianState.      I cannot help feeling that the force of this argument would be seriously weakened if,  at the same time,we introduced a measure of State control,  under whatever . ,disguise, in that sphere in which m..re than almost any otherour&quot;pe3ple are attached to the principles of free discussion and negotiation - namely, the determination of wages andconditions of employment.
k* &apos;    Nevertheless I am very conscious that the Government,having deliberately adopted the policy of a planned economy,including the socialisation of a number of the most important industries and services,  should face up to the full implications of that policy.      In particular I ogre    that theGovernment cannot stand aside in face of movements which notonly by their inflationary effect threaten the standards of life in this country but by raising prices above a competitivelevel might seriously prejudice the export policy upon&apos;thesuccess of which jur whole future depends.      In the&apos;field ofwages this means,  in my view, that the Government should take all steps in their power by way of guidance, exhortation andappeal to persuade both employers and trade unions toexercise restraint in negotiations relating to wages and tokeep before them as an overriding consideration the wellbeingof the country as a whole.      I am, therefore, attracted by theidea, which was tentatively put forward by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer himself in our discussion on 13th November,  thatthe Government should issue a statement on wages policy whichwould set out the principal economic considerations to beborne in mind in wages negotiations and,  if an agreed and suitable form of words can be found, the principles which inthe Government1s view should govern wage movements at thepresent time.      I attach the draft of such a statement whichis based largely upon that circulated by the Chancellor of theExchequer with CP. (1+7) 303.5* Coming now to the more specific question on which Iwas invited to report to the Cabinet, namely the method ofdealing with claims by employees of Public Boards and localauthorities,  I am convinced that as regards the machinery forthe settlement of wages and conditi ,ns of employment theGovernment&apos;s policy must be consistent and apply uniformlyover the whole- field of employment.      The Government cannothove one policy in relation to those industries and services which are owned and managed by Public Boards or localauthorities and another policy in relation to other industries and services.      It would be indefensible and would,  I amcertain,  lead to much trouble and unrest for the Government toadopt a policy aimed at determining the wages and conditions ofcoalrniners but not of steel workers;    of transport workers butnot of building workers;    of teachers and local authorities&apos;clerical staffs but not of staffs of banks or insurance companies.      The Government&apos;s present policy towards wages andconditions of employment iri industries and services run by public Boards and local authorities is in line with its generalpolicy in this matter - to leave them to be determined by representatives of the employing body and of the workers - andshould continue so.6. On the other hand the Government has s special responsibility in relation to the socialised industries and services both because of the action taken by the Government inregard to them and because of their fundamental importance toour whole&apos;economy.      It is therefore essential that employers&apos;and workers&apos;  representatives in those industries and. services should be fully informed on the general economic situation sothat claims are made and negotiated with these wider considerations in mind,, and special steps should be taken toensure that information of this kind is provided for the negotiating bodies.
7. Something more might &quot;be done in the case of claims which involve a charge on the Exchequer.     While I believe,as already indicated,  that it would be improper for theGovernment to intervene directly in the settlement of wages of such employees as in the case of all other employees, I regard it as equally indefensible for the Government to stand aside and as a matter of course accept as a charge on theExchequer any additional expenditure arising from increased wages negotiated by persons who do not have the ultimate responsibility for finding the money.      I agree that in thesecases there is little or no incentive on the pert of the negotiators to act with a proper regard for economy or with a proper sense of responsibility towards the general welfare and I think that some steps should be taken which would actas a counterweight to this lack of incentive.      What is wonted,however,  in my view,  is not the establishment of machinery tocontrol wages in these cases (if,  as I assume,  that is what is meant as a &quot;more positive wages policy&quot;) but a review ofGovernment policy in regard to grants and subsidies, so thatin future the Government would not automatically increase grants and subsidies in order to compensate for increased costs arisingfrom improvements in wages;    nor in the case of commodities and services that are subject to price control should the Governmentautomatically concur in increased prices for the purpose ofreimbursing employers for increased costs arising from increases in wages.      I think the Government should make an early announcement to this effect.8. I do not disguise the fact that such a policy might give rise to considerable opposition and would be difficult of application.      The determination of whether a particularincrease in wages was or was not contrary to the publicinterest - which is the criterion by which each proposed increase would have to be judged - would be far from easy.Nevertheless the advantages of discouraging, without direct government intervention in individual cases, an attitude ofextravagance or carelessness in negotiation of wages claims in my view outweigh the disadvantages.      It would not of courseprevent all wage increases in the class of case underconsideration, nor indeed is this desirable;    but it could beexpected to discourage the granting of claims which are notreasonable or are extravagant.      I believe that such an attitude on the part of the Government would appeal to most people aseminently - reasonable and I recommend that a statement on thelines I have suggested should be included in the announcementsuggested in paragraph 1+ above.9. If it is agreed that such an announcement should bemade it is essential to let the T.U.C.  know what is proposed and to carry the T.U.C. with us.      Moreover the question of timing is most important.      I understand that the T.U.C.  expect to moke a further report on the economic situation,  that thisreport is likely to contain further references to wages policyand that it will probably be published after their meeting in February.      Accordingly I recommend that the draft statement should be conveyed privately to the T.U.C. with a view to thepublication of statements boy the Government and by the T.U.C.which would be mutually complementary and helpful,  and with aview to the issue of the statement being timed so as to ensurethe maximum response from all parties.
21010.       Summary(1) Attention is called to important recent developments which confirm the Cabinet&apos;s view that it would be a profound mistake to attempt to control wage movements.(2)    This applies to claims by employees of Public boards and of local authorities as to all other employees.Government policy vis a vis the machinery for negotiating conditions of employment should beuniform over the whole field of employment.(3)    On the other hand the Government has a responsibility to discourage movements which by their inflationary pressure result in a lowering of the standards ofliving in this country or which, by raising costsabove a competitive level, seriously threaten our export policy upon the success of which our economicsurvival depends.(k)    Accordingly the Government should issue a statementdrawing attention to the effects on our economicsituation of alterations in individual incomes and setting out for the guidance of those who participate in wage negotiations the general principles which,in the Government&apos;s view, should govern wagemovements.      A suggested draft of such a statement is attached.(5)    The Government has a particular responsibility inregard to the wages claims of employees of socialised industries and services and special steps should betaken to ensure that the negotiating bodies of such industries and services are kept informed from timeto time of the facts relating to the economicsituation of the country.(6)    In regard to wages claims which involve a charge onthe Exchequer the Government should announce thatthey will not automatically increase grants orsubsidies, nor concur in increased prices,  in orderto compensate for additional costs resulting fromwage increases.      This statement would be includedin the announcement proposed at (h) above.(7)    It is essential to carry the T.U.C. with us and inaddition the question of timing is more important.I recommend that the Government statement whendrafted and approved ^should be conveyed privately to the T.U.G. with a view to its being issued at themoment when, in relation to the further statement which the T.U.C.  intend to issue,  it can be expectedto have the maximum response from all parties.G. t\. 11Ministry of Labour and National Service,S.W.1.&apos; 23rd January, 19h8.
211APPENDIXDRAFT STATEMENT ON WAGES POLICY&quot;1 * The Government&apos;a economic policy depends largely forits success upon our ability to make&apos;and sell&apos;the exports&apos;necessary to &quot;buy the imports we need to feed our people and keep our industry going.      Our costs of production are of vitalimportance and they depend to a considerable extent on the amount which industry has to pay in profits,  salaries and wages.      these in turn in the form of individual incomes affect the total volume of money -available in relation to tho quantity of goods.A further factor affecting tho situation is the relationship between individual incomes in different occupations.2. As regards costs of production,  it was pointed out inthe &quot;Statement on the Economic Considerations affecting Relationsbetween Employers and Workers&quot; issued with the endorsement ofthe&apos; National Joint Advisory Council &quot;if costs  of production andin consequence prices rise in relation to world prices, it maymake it impossible for us to pay our way in the w -rid and buy ellthe imports we need&quot;.      We shall all suffer os a result and it istherefore the duty of everyone to ploy his or her port in avertingthe danger.3* Even now there is some inflationary pressure at work.There is still too much money chasing after t:.- few goods.      this situation will grow worse,  in the absence of measures to correctit,  eg the full effects of  our cuts in imports and the diversion of goods from the home market f r oxp.rt are felt.      This will result in the volume of goods available at h .me being stillfurther reduced.      If this further reduction of goods at homewere to be accompanied by any general increase in the lovol of individual incomes,  without really substantial increases in production,  inflation would inevitobly follow.      Unless this danger can be kept in check we shall fail in our export tasks;prices will rise out of control and the whole stabliity of our economy will be endangered.1+. Over the last century particular economic considerationshave developed traditional or customary relationships between individual incomes in different Occupations, which hove norelevance to present-day conditions and necessities.      the relation which different individual incomes bear to, one anothermust no longer be determined by this historial development  of thepast, but by the urgent needs  of the moment.      In the changed worldof today and with our present economic difficulties these oldrelationships of income have no relevance,  end must for the verysake of our survival be altered the better to conform to thenational interest.      Relotive income levels must bo ouch as toencourage the movement of labour to those industries where it is most needed,  and should not,  as in some cases they still do,tempt it in a contrary direction;5. in the circumstances detailed above the Government feel bound to take the exceptional step of setting out the following general considerations as a guioie to all those whose deliberationsand actions contribute to the settlement of the amount of individual incomes: -
212It is neither possible nor desirable for the Governmentto interfere directly with the income of individualsotherwise than by taxation.      To go further wouldmean that the Government would be forced itself to assess and regulate all individual incomes accordingto some scale which would hove to be determined.This would be on incursion by the Government intowhat has hitherto been wholly regarded as a field of free contract between individuals end organisations.In the view of the Government it is essential thatthere should be the strictest adherence to the termsof collective agreements.      One of the mainI advantages of a system of collective bargaining isthat it tends to ensure that wages movements takeplace in on orderly manner end with due regard tothe general as opposed to the individual interest.Departure from the agreed conditions by individual employers, whether public authorities  or private-concerns, will inevitably constitute a grove danger to the stability of the system,  and may well lead tocompetitive bargaining,  to general but unjustifiableincreases in wages and to serious inflation.     Thevalue of the system of collective bargaining and the justification for its maintenance at the present timerest upon the assumption that the terms of collective agreements will be observed loyally by all employersand workers and the Government cannot stress toohighly the importance which they attach to this principle.In present conditions,  and until more goods&apos; and services ore available for the home market,  there isno reason or justification for any gen oral increaseof individual money incomes.      Such on increase will increase costs of production and cannot make moregoods available and so con have only in inflationaryeffect.      Unless related to a substantial increase in production,  it would drive up prices,  adversely affect pensioners,  children and other recipientsof social services benefits,  increase the money costof our exports and s.. reduce their saleability andIby black market pressure moke it almost impossibleto operate the controls necessary in view of the continuing scarcity of  supplies and manpower.It does not follow that it would be right to stabiliseall incomes as they stand today.      There may well becases in which increases in wages would be justified,for example where existing wages are below areasonable minimum or where it is essential in thenational interest to man up an undermanned industryand it is clear that only an increase in wages will attract the necessary labour.      It does mean,however, that each claim for an increase in wagesmust bo considered on its merits and not on thebasis of maintaining a former relativity as between different occupations and industries.If there should be a marked rise in the cost of livingthe level of those individual incomes, which as aresult became inadequate to provide a decent standardof living would need reconsideration.
2136. It will be observed from the above principles that thereis no justification at the present time for any rise in incomesfrom profits,  rent, or other like sources and that rises in wagesor salaries should only &quot;be asked for and agreed upon in one of the exceptional cases mentioned above.7- In order to avoid all necessity for undesirableinterference with the existing methods of free negotiation andcontract the Government must press upon all those engaged in negotiations or decisions which might result in an increase in individual incomes to keep these principles firmly before them,and not to depart from them.8.    . Those principles should be applied not only in the caseof employees whose wages form a charge upon the income of theundertaking by which they are employed.      They apply equallyin the case of State servants and of employees the cost of whosewages involves a charge, by wcy of grant or subsidy,  upon theNational Exchequer.      In regard to the latter class  of employeethe Government wish to state categorically that they will not automatically increase grants or subsidies in order to compensate for additional costs resulting from increases in wages.Similarly, in the cose of commodities and services that are subject to price control, the Government will not automaticallyconcur in increased prices for the purpose of reimbursingemployers for increased costs arising from increases in wages.Each case will have to be considered on its merits in relationto the principles enunciated above.9. To sum up,  if general increases in individual money incomes take place&apos; without  nore goods being made available,no-one can obtain any real benefit except the black marketoperator;    the rest of the community has to. endure the dislocationand hardship which inevitably accompanies inflation.      In short,the alternative now before us ore a general agreement by thepeople to act upon sound lines or economic and social disaster.
