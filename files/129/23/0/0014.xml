DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power attach atdraft of the Gas Bill which was announced in the King&apos;s Speech on 21st October, 1947, and also forecast in the Lord President&apos;s statement on 19th November, 1945*     Th-Bill was considered by the Committee on the Socialisation ofIndustries on 17th October and 8th January (see S.I.(M)(47) 36and (A3) 1 and also CP. (47) 124).     A number of the Clausesare almost identical with those of the Electricity Act andthese ar^ m, rlced with an asterisk in the x\rrangement ofGlauses.Proposed Structure   A&apos; Nationalised .(k:3 industry. There is nothing ..41 the technical side in the gas industry corresponding to centralised generation in electricity,and gas is suitable for the maximum of decentralisation.      Itis proposed that the fundamental units in the nationalised gas industry should be Area (i.e. Regional) Boards.     These will be,as far as possible, autonomous, and the functions of the central body v/ill be mainly advisory and financial.     This means,inevitably, that some of the central co-ordinating functionsmust be vested in the Minister.Area boards. There are to be 12 Area Boards (see First Schedule),compared with 10 recommended by the Heyworth Committee and 14in the Electricity Act.     The Areas will correspond fairlyclosely with those for electricity, with the followingdifferences -(a) Scotland and Wales are each to be a single separatearea.     Scotland is, in amount of gas supplied,  equivaler, &apos; toa fairly large English Area;    the Scottish Gas Board is t   beappointed after consultation with the Secretary of State(Clause 5 (2)).&quot;   Wales will probably be, from the gas pointof view, the smallest of the Areas;    there is not the sametechnical case as in electricity for linking North Wales withLancashire.(b) London is to be divided into two Areas by the Thames,i.e.  a North Thames Area, corresponding approximately to theArea of the Gas Light and Coke Company, and a South EasternArea, which will include Kent and the South Coast.Relation between Area Boards and central Bodyh,      (a)    The central body will be a Gas Council, consistingof the Chairmen of the Area Boards with an Independent Chairmancp.

Q 1*45/end deputy chairman (clause 5 (h))..(b) area boards will submit their capital programmes to the minister for approval;   before approval is given,the minister will consult the gas council (clause 1 (5))*;ye discussed this matter at the meeting on 8th january ofthe committee on the socialisation of industries and agreedthat drafting the bill in this way was preferable to giving to the gas council the important power of co-ordinatingarea boards&apos; capital programmes.(c) the minister has power to give general directions to area boards, but the gas council has no such power(clause 7 (1)).(d) area boards will own the gas assets (clause 17 (1)),will be financially autonomous and,  therefore, individuallyresponsible for making ends meet, &quot;taking one year with another&quot;,  in their areas (clause 37);    and they will have complete discretion to fix tariffs,  on which the central council will have no say (clause i+9 (h))*(e) the gas council,  consisting as it will mainly ofthe area board chairmen, will be the expert body to whichthe minister will look for advice about the industry andit will also, by agreement,  perform common services forarea boards (clause 2).(f) the gas council will co-ordinate research,training and education (clauses 3 and 1+).      there will be considerable flexibility here.      area boards may,  and nodoubt will, themselves conduct research (clause 3 (3))*the general research programme and the other activitiesof the gas council will be financed by a levy on the area boards (clause i+h).(g) the gas council will also, in effect,  act as a centralfinancing body for the industry, because,  on the advice ofthe treasury and the bank of england, i feel that there mustbe a central gas stock and not area stocks (clause 39)*    area boards will be required to service their quota of stock(clause A0(2)), and also to contribute to the central reserve,or guarantee, fund (clause 1+2).      the latter fund is toprovide an insurance against autonomous area boards getting into financial difficulties;      in that event the gas council,with the approval of the minister, is to be allowed to exercisedetailed direction over the defaulting area board (clause 1+2(5)).undertakings to be covered5. the bill differs from the electricity act in that non-statutory undertakings, as well as statutory companies andlocal authority undertakings, will be nationalised;    as in electricity it is proposed to take over the holding companies(clause 15(1)).      the necessity for vesting of the non-statutory undertakings was made clear by the heyworth committee;non-statutory undertakings in the gas industry, though smallin size, are numerous and their re-organisation will be a    .major &quot;task for the new area boards.
jjojce oven plantscertain complications arise &quot;because the gas industry makes other products than gas, and because gas isnade at coke oven plants as well as at gasworks.    the coke ovens and the gasworks operate, basically,  the same process -the carbonization of coal to produce gas, coke and by-productssuch as coal tar and benzole.], a large number of colliery coke oven plants hovevested in, or are in process of transfer to, the national coal board.    the carbonization capacity of these plants isabout 10 million tons of coal per annum, about half that ofthe whole gas industry and there are a number of problemscommon to the gas and colliery coke oven industries.      it is thus necessary to provide for the fullest possibleco-ordination between the gas boards and the notional coolboard in the coke oven areas and clause 1+7 does this in twonays, by providing for :-(a) joint operation of plants, etc;(b) in the lost resort, and after an independent enquiry (clause 1+7(5)), transfer of plants (i.e. coke ovensto the gas boards or gasworks to the national coal board).8. there is no case for doing anything on these lin^with the coke ovens, of the iron and steel industry, but the gas boards will obtain their surplus gas because the boardsjill have the exclusive right to distribute gas to thepublic (clause 1+8)..   there will, however, be no restrictionIon the right of iron and steel or other companies toimanufacture gas for their own use or for the use of their parents or subsidiaries (clause 1+8(6)).protection of the consumer9. the main points on this are :-(a) there will be consultative councils for each area,as in the electricity act (clause 9).    appeal byconsultative councils will be to the minister, not to the gas council, and he may refer disputes to a referee(clause 9(7)).(b) there is to be a ministry inspectorate fortesting gas quality and gas meters.    this follows a recommendation of the heyworth report and replaces theexisting archaic system (glauses 50 and 51).(c) the relevant clauses of the old gas code oremostly reproduced in the second schedule.     but the existingcontrols of gas price, mainly by reference to dividends,mich appear in the local acts and orders, must disappear.the form of consumer protection appropriate to the new circumstances is the consultative council, with the right ofappeal to the minister.
Cgmpengation for undertakings10. The basis of compensation proposed is similarto electricity, namely : -(a) share market value for companies;(b) net outstanding debt (together with a payment for severance) for local authorities (Clauses 26 and 27)Complications arise because the quotations of a number of undertakings, some of them important, were depressed as aresult of the Blitz.    The proportion of unquoted shores ismuch greater in the case of the gas industry than for electricity.    It is hoped that the value of these can, ingeneral, be settled by agreement with the Stockholders&apos;Representative, but there may have to be recourse toarbitrationsCompensation for individuals11. There are two points to which I should draw attention :-(a)     Co-partnershipCo-partnership is highly developed in the gas industry, but it looks as if the existing schemes willhave to be wound up (Clause 55).    The Trade Unions covering the workers in the gas industry, whom I have seen, were quite unmoved about the disappearance of co-partnership.Apart from the compensation which they will receive fromco-partnership shores, co-partners will also be eligible for compensation for loss of emoluments under Clause 56.    Wemust hope that, as a substitute, Area Boards will developeffective arrangements for joint consultation and incentivwage payment, under Clause 53.(b)    Compensation to officersClause 56 follows closely the correspondingsections of the Transport and Electricity Acts.    A difficulties    tpoint arises as to whether &quot;worsening of conditions&quot; shoe .be included in this Bill,  as it was in the Electricity on transport Acts, as a ground for compensation under theregulations to be made under the Clause.    After discussion,at the Committee on the Socialisation of Industries, I amconsulting further with the Lord President and the Chance alorpf the Exchequer.I -12. Subject to the views of my colleagues I propose tosubmit the draft Bill to the Legislation Committee andthereoft:r to arrange for its introduction in the House ofCommons as   won as possible.II.
