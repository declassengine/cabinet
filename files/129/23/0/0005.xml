(48) 5oth January, 1948CABINETPOLICY IN germany memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsRecommendationsI ask for the approval of my colleagues for dealing with the german problem along the following general lines, and with latitude to set up the necessary machinery to deal with special questions as and when this becomes necessary.A:-^-General(1) It should be clearly known in Germany and elsewhere that the guiding principle of British policy towards Germany is that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill not be a party to creating a situation which can be used to bring aboutgradually a Communist-controlled Germany on the pattern of the post-wardevelopment of events throughout Eastern Europe. There must, therefore, be a clear understanding of what is meant by such phrases as &apos;&apos; the democratic develop-meht &quot; of Germany! We should show clearly that in the British view such demo-cratic development is inconsistent with the creation of a police state and the revival of the Gestapo under another name.(2) The object of His Majesty&apos;s Government is to proceed as rapidly aspossible with the necessary measures for the reconstitution of a stable, peaceful and democratic Germany, if possible by agreement between the four controllingPowers. If, however, such agreement cannot be secured, then those controllingPowers who are prepared to co-operate must proceed so far as necessary with suchpractical measures as cannot be delayed any longer.B. Reconstruction of Western Germany.(3) As a first step we should begin to extend the scope of the existing bizonaleconomic organisation at Frankfurt, both in numbers and in powers and responsibility.(4) We should make plans for elections and the formation later in 1948 ofGerman bodies exercising most of the functions of a Government and Parliament.(5) We should use the intervening period for discussion with the Americans(and later with the French) and with the Germans on the form of constitution and the methods &quot;of election to be employed for this Government. Our plans,which would be based on the political principles tabled in Moscow, would be applicable in the first place in the bizonal or trizonal area, but should also be immediately and plainly applicable to an all-German Government.(6) Steps to carry out financial reform on a Four-Power basis should be taken.If agreement on this subject is : aipossible we should immediately proceed on abizonal, and if possible on a trizonal, basis.(7) Without placing the recovery of Western Germany before that of the liberated countries, we should do our utmost to raise the level of production inthe bizonal area with the object of achieving the targets set in replies to the marshall Plan questionnaire as soon as possible and to improve the German34749 this document is the property of his britannic majestvs government   -
standard of living to this end. The immediate aim must be to raise the presentrjifcion scctl.6(8) All possible steps should be taken to increase trade between the bizonalarea and Eastern Germany and the iron curtain countries.(9) We should continue to insist on the firm implementation of our repara-tions plan and should resist any proposal to suspend deliveries to the Soviet union and her satellites. Should we none the less have to agree to suspend all deliveries to Russia, we should only agree that actual delivery of the plant should be deferredbut that it should continue to be allocated to the Soviet Union and stored inGermany.   I shall offer the most stubborn opposition even to this.(10) It should be our policy to endeavour to maintain in being, with a viewto restoring a unified German state, under all necessary safeguards, the Four-Power agreements by which we are bound as one of the controlling Powers. If,however, this proves impracticable, I should then have to ask my colleagues to consent to depart from these agreements so far as may be necessary.(11) We should make it clear that it has never been our policy to dismemberGermany. This is clear from the Yalta and Potsdam discussions. On the otherhand, we are not prepared to accept a degree of centralisation in Germany whichwould make Germany a menace to the peace of Europe. Our very consistencyputs us in a strong position to rebut the Soviet claim to be the sole champion ofGerman unity.C. Negotiations between the Western Powers concerning the Future of Germany(12) We should get in touch with the United States Government through the diplomatic channel and try to reach a general understanding with them on matters such as the adherence to the agreement for the political organisation of the bizonalarea, the delivery of capital reparations to the Soviet Union, the best method of bringing the French into the bizonal arrangements, the Ruhr, the Saar, andBerlin. Some of these subjects would also be covered by Anglo-American talks in Berlin. We should enter into informal and very private discussions with the americans on the question of the security of Western Germany and how we can best satisfy the French security requirements, and I will then report to theCabinet.(13) The French should be invited to get in touch with the Anglo-american authorities in Berlin in order to acquaint themselves thoroughly with the existingbizonal arrangements. They should then be asked for their comments and sug-suggestions. No hard and fast agreement should be reached at this stage, nor indeeduntil I had consulted the Cabinet again.^(14) Staff talks with the French will be begun shortly and will be limited inthe first instance to questions of army reorganisation and equipment.(15) In order to clear up the question of the Saar we should now consult withthe Americans to decide how we can best make progress without sacrificing our interests to those of the French. It is obvious that this must be settled before wecan deal with further French claims, e.g., about the Ruhr.(16) In general, talks on the above subjects with the Americans will takeplace in London except when they can be more conveniently held in Germany.Situation resulting from the Breakdown of the Council of Foreign ministers. The failure of the Council of Foreign Ministers to reach agreement onany outstanding issues is a milestone in our German policy. The breakdown wasnot unexpected, although the situation was aggravated by the way in which m. Molotov over-played his hand. However, until the very end I did not abandonhope of some agreement. My main difficulty arose from the underlying difference of approach between one of the four Powers at the table and the other three.This was not simply a question of conference tactics, but a fundamental difference of view and outlook. The conflict is between the Soviet desire to dominate Europepolitically and economically and the desire of the three Western Powers to put
Europe on its feet again with American backing. We had known for a long time before the Conference opened that the actions^f&quot;the Russians, both political andeconomic, in their zone had created a situation which was totally contrary to thatwhich we were aiming to establish in Germany as a whole. This has been effected,moreover, by a consistent policy of suppression of the freedom of the individual,closely parallel to that followed in other Eastern European countries.Discrimination against the personalities, activities and publicity services ofnon-Communist political parties, beginning with the Social Democrats, theincarceration of political opponents in the same concentration camps as were used by the Nazis, the forced deportation of labour to the U.S.S.R., the rearrest ofprisoners of war returning to the Soviet Zone from the West, politicaldiscrimination in the distribution of economic resources, and an extreme form ofcentralisation of all types of public authority under the domination of theSocialist Unity Party; these are some of the methods consistently employed bythe Soviet authorities for the realisation of their unilateral policy of occupation.The general effect of Russian occupation for two and a half years is that theEastern Zone has been harnessed economically and politically to the Sovietsystem in Eastern Europe.2. All our information about Russian plans for the meeting of the Councilof Foreign Ministers was to the effect that they did not intend to abate the policywhich they had hitherto pursued in the Eastern Zone. Further, they intended,if possible, to extend their political and economic system into the Western Zoneswith the object of winning Germany over to Communism and to undermine oneof the principal pillars of the Marshall Plan. Their best methods of achieving this would have been to bind the other three Powers to a joint policy in germany as a whole, which would in practice have allowed them a free hand to operatedirectly and through German Communist stooges in the Western Zones, while at the same time they prevented, on grounds of military security, any penetrationeither political or economic of the Eastern Zone by the Western Powers.3. With this knowledge we were bound to enter the Conference with considerable reserve. Events proved that this reserve was felt even more stronglyby the French and American Delegations. I wish to emphasise, however, that my mind was very far from being closed, and that up till the last few minutesI waited hopefully for any sign of a change of heart by M. Moiotov or any indication that the Soviet Delegation were genuinely anxious to reach an agree-ment which was not designed to communise Germany and destroy the MarshallPlan. Considering the number of points where there was a deep difference ofopinion between the Soviet Government on the one hand and some or all of theother three Governments on the other, it would have been necessary for a consider-able modification to take place in Soviet designs and policy if confidence was tobe restored among the Four Powers at the table and a genuine agreement to emerge. Far from this, however, there was no sign of any such change. It was this that was the real cause of the breakdown of the Conference and I do not propose to go further into details on the points of disagreement of which mycolleagues are already fully aware.Present situation. We have therefore reached a point when we must consider urgentlybut soberly what our future policy in Germany is to be. This is a wide field,and the principal problems are discussed below. We must realise that the failure to reach agreement at the Council of Foreign Ministers means that, whether welike it or not, the division between East and West in Germany, which itself is part and parcel of the same division throughout the world, will continue and islikely to be sharper. I do not, however, consider that such a division can or should be permanent. The German desire for unity will, I am sure, prove too strong for this. It is probably the strongest force in Germany to-day. Anjrridentist movement is certain to arise sooner or later. In the long run, therefore,the will to unite in Germany will bring the Eastern Zone and the Western Zonestogether. The problem for us is to bring this unity about as soon as possible,but in such a way as to ensure that the forces of attraction operate from the Westupon the East and not vice versa as the Soviet Union intend with their aim ofdominating the whole of Europe. We want to see established in the western zones in Germany a1 political and economic system to join which the germans in the Eastern Zone will exert all their energy, and which will in the end prevailp;:, - .34749 ,;&apos; &quot; ;l   b 2
over the standards and system established in the Soviet ^one. This ^ask isprimarilv one for the Germans and not for any of the Occupying Powers howevergood the&quot; indentions of these may be. We must, however, see that the Germans,throughout Germany as a whole, achieve their unity with the support ot tfteWestern Powers and not in the face of their opposition. This is important, itwe are not careful, national unity will become a slogan to be used by the Germansagainst the Occupying Powers and their neighbours. It will be represented by tneGermans that the only obstacle to unity is the Allied occupation and control, andthat all Germans must unite to fight against this control. If that occurs we shallbe faced with resurgence of nationalistic Germany.5 It is not likely that Germany alone could become a menace to the peace of the world in the near future, the really dangerous situation would be a combination of any large part of Germany and Russia. If Russian man-powerand resources were to be harnessed to German industrial power, technical skill and trained man-power, and were to be directed against Western Europe, theposition would be extremely dangerous. This is an idea which would not be unwelcome to some Germans, and much as they fear and dislike the Russians theymight prefer an alliance with Russia to the present stagnation. I do not thinkthat the Russians are likely to seek such an alliance, since they would recognise the great dangers which it&quot;would hold for them. Nevertheless it constitutes themain potential danger, and we must bear it always in mind.6. We should accordingly make it clear that it is our policy to restore the unity of Germany as soon as possible. The Russian claim to be the sole championof German unity should be exposed and we should do our best to make the Germansunderstand throughout what may prove a long period, that true unity and therestoration of Germany can only be achieved under the auspices of ourselves and the other Western Powers and not of German nationalism or SovietCommunism. Our policy in this respect has been consistent throughout. already at the Yalta and Potsdam discussions we took a stand against the dismembermentof Germany. On the other hand, we have always opposed Germany beingcentralised to an extent which would make her once again a menace to the peace of Europe and of the world. Our very consistency puts us in a strong positionto rebut the Soviet claim to be the sole champion of German unity. We should avoid taking any irrevocable step which would make final agreement betweenthe Four Powers on a unified Germany impossible. But I would ask my colleagues to leave to me the timing of such action as may become necessary, i would, ofcourse, consult them before taking any important decision, and I shall watch thesituation very carefully with the constant desire to avoid any action which woulddivide Germany irrevocably.7. It is difficult to lay down exactly at this stage all the steps whichHis Majesty&apos;s Government may now have to take in Germany. Some should inany case be taken soon, and these are discussed successively below. Others may be forced upon us, either after we have had discussions with the Americans and theFrench or in order to forestall or counteract steps by the Soviet Government.There are also a number of important but lesser matters where action may be expedient but which are not discussed in the present paper. We must bear ismind throughout the coming months that we have now reached a stage in Germanywhere we must take account of German public opinion. I do not suggest thatour policy should be governed solely by what the Germans think, but even if we wished, we have no longer the power to force unpopular measures upon theGermans for very-long, and our policy is much more likely to be successful if itmeets with the general approval of responsible German opinion.8. I would like here to mention that in my conversations with the UnitedStates Secretary of State after the end of the Conference Mr Marshall said thathe Was anxious to receive specific proposals from me on future methods forco-operation between the Three Powers on Germany. M. Bidault was even moreimpressed by the need for urgent consultation, in particular with regard tothe question of the future of the Ruhr. Mr. Marshall agreed with M Bidaultthat conversations between the Three Powers at a Government level should takeplace in London at an early date but he made it clear- that these talks should cover the long-range aspects of the German problem and that any tentativeagreement which might be reached with respect to the Ruhr would be contingentupon ^Ment.oh-the;-ol^r aspects of the German settlement. This wai in line with the attitude I had adopted with M Bidault.
9. I have tried to deal in the present paper with all the more urgent matters,Ibut I wOuld ask my colleagues to give me some latitude as to the way in which11 deal with them as they arise, and particularly as to the manner in which IJdiscuss them with the United States and French Governments. I will of courseSbe careful to see that my colleagues are kept informed of all importantIdevelopments.iPolitical Organisation in the Bizonal Area10.   If we are to be go ahead quickly with recovery in Western Germany,ll am satisfied that much more authority and responsibility must be given to the(Germans.  They must be made to feel that their recovery rests in their own hands.Apart from economic assistance, which is dealt with separately, the best methodof achieving our object will be to give the Germans in the bizonal area a betterpolitical organisation.   The obvious method would be to proceed at once to theestablishment of a provisional Western German Government at Frankfurt.  Thiswould certainly be popular in Germany, though there might be some oppositionto calling the new body a &apos;&apos; government&apos;&apos; at the present stage.  There are, however,serious difficulties.   First, we have not yet reached any final agreement withJthe Americans on the exact form of constitution for such a government.   ThisI question could probably be settled fairly soon, but we must not forget that ifJthe French are to come in they will have decided views on this matter and we doI not wish to face them with a fait accompli.   Secondly, to take such a step nowfmight give the Russians a pretext for taking a similar step in Eastern Germanyland, much more serious, probably encourage them to denounce the Four-PowerImachinery altogether and to drive the Western Allies out of Berlin.   It islimportant that we should stay in Berlin for the present and that the Four-PowerImachinery should not collapse.   Thirdly, accommodation is not available at(Frankfurt for a large increase in German Departments with their staffs.[Generally speaking, our object still being to restore a unified German state underIproper safeguards, we should continue to endeavour to maintain the Four-power agreements by which we are bound as one of the controlling Powers.  If, however,I this proves impracticable I should then have to ask my colleagues to consent to depart from them.11. For these reasons, therefore, I am opposed to taking any dramatic stepi at the present moment. I think we should proceed by gradual methods and by extending, in the first place, the scope of the existing bizonal economic organisa-stion at Frankfurt. The members of this organisation nominated by the LandtageIwould be increased and extra powers and responsibility would be given to it from(time to time. The two Commanders-in-Chief should report to us on the steps!being taken and contemplated in this field.12. We must, however, face the fact that the pressure, both political andeconomic, in favour of the establishment of a representative provisional GermanGovernment (whatever it be called) for the Western Zones will grow. In fact, ifwe are to establish as soon as possible economic prosperity in the Western Zones,we shall have to have elections and a German body exercising the functions ofgovernment. I contemplate that the time for this will probably be about the endof the summer. When this step is taken, if not sooner, the Russians are likelyto react by setting up a provisional governmental organisation in the Eastern Zone.If the Russians do make any such move we shall of course have to reconsidervery carefully the action we are proposing to take at Frankfurt. I do not wishat this stage to say what our reactions should be, but we clearly could not allow the Russians to gain too long a lead in establishing a so-called GermanGovernment.i 18. We must use the intervening period for discussion with the Americans(and later with the French) and with the Germans, on the form of constitution and the^ timing and methods of election. The plans would be applicable in thefirst event in the bizonal or trizonal area, but they should also be immediately andplainly applicable to an all-German Government. The Legislature would be of abicameral nature; the second. Chamber being representative of the interests of theI Lander. There would be an executive responsible to the Legislature and therewould be a Supreme Court; and the division of powers between the central german Government and the Lander would be carefully worked out.. I do notI wish to go into any details here, since I have submitted papers on earlier occasionsto my colleagues on this matter, and I am not contemplating any substantialdeparture from the principles set out in them.   The broad basis would be the
Jrinciples which I tabled at the Moscow meeting of the Council ofForeign Ministers, with such modifications as are agreed. I cannot be more preciseabout this whole question at present since the whole matter so much depends upontiming, the views of the Americans and the French, and possible Soviet action.14. From the point of view of German morale and production it is clearly desirable to make a public statement of our intentions as soon as we have agree-- ment with the Americans and the French. The House of Commons will no doubtpress to be informed. I shall have, therefore, to keep in close touch with the americans and French with a view to such a public statement at the first suitabledate.Economic and Financial Measures15. If we are to achieve the objective set out above i.e., to ensure that theforces of attraction operate from the West upon the East and not vice versa-it is essential that we, in conjunction with the Americans, should do everything possible to accelerate the economic recovery of the Western Zones, to raise thestandard of living of their inhabitants and to link their economy closely with thatof Western Europe. Furthermore, the rehabilitation of the Western Zones andthe early re-establishment of a balanced economy there are essential not only toput an end to the present burden on the British and American taxpayers, but toenable the Zones to play their full part under the Marshall Plan in the economicrestoration of Western Europe. The most useful step that can be taken in thisdirection is that already outlined above i.e., to give the Germans more political authority and responsibility. The Germans have already been given considerableresponsibility in the economic field, but the absence of corresponding politicalresponsibility has deprived these economic concessions of much of their value.Not until the Germans have a considerable measure of political responsibility can we expect them to take those steps for the setting up of an efficient food adminis-tration or for the control of the black market which are so essential to the recovery of the Zones. From the economic point of view it is, therefore, most desirablethat no time should be lost in pushing on with the plans outlined in paragraphs 10to 13 above. In addition, however, there are certain other steps which must betaken if we are to make any real progress with the economic recovery of the jWestern Zones.Financial Reform16. The economy of Western Germany cannot recover unless a real valuecan be given to the currency and the ordinary money incentives, which at present no longer operate, can thereby be restored for workers, producers and, above all,exporters. This will involve a substantial measure of financial reform, under two main headings; first, a readjustment of German internal prices (with a consequentreadjustment of wages) to bring them into proper relation with each other andwith world prices; and, secondly, a currency conversion designed to wipe out thehuge excess of purchasing power now circulating in Germany. Mr. Marshallhas told me that he is most anxious for one more effort to be made at the control council to secure such reform throughout Germany on a Four Power basis. Ifwe were successful, the effects of the split between East and West would be much reduced. There would be a common currency throughout Germany and the wayto eventual unification would be easier. On the other hand, Mr. Marshall and Iboth feel that we cannot delay the essential financial reforms in the bizonal areaif the Russians make difficulties. The Americans have already printed sufficientcurrency for the whole of Germany and it is now available there. If the proposalat the Control Council fails to go through within a very short time, I recommendthat we should proceed at once with the essential steps in the bizonal area, and if \these can be extended to the French Zone also, so much the better. The matter is Iat present under examination by British and American technical experts in berlin and I will keep in close touch with the situation.! &apos;Increase in Production in the Bizonal A rea&apos;    17.   Subject always to the proviso that we must not place the recovery of western Germany before that of the liberated countries and bearing in minoVthespecial sensitiveness of the French in this connexion, we must, in conjunction withthe Americans, do our utmost to raise the level of production in the bizonal area--- Imore particularly m respect of food, coal and steel-with the object of achievingmthe targets set in the bizonal area&apos;s replies to the Marshall Plan questionnaire^assoon as possible.  The extent to which this can be done will, of oouroA^d^^i
imainly on the Germans themselves, but for some considerable time to come muchswill also depend on the assistance in the shape of food and raw materials furnished[to Western Germany from outside. Food is, perhaps, the most important singleIfactor in the recovery of the German economy. In addition to ensuring adequateImports of cereals, fats, &amp;c, it is important to increase the supply of fertilisersland agricultural equipment and to achieve conditions which will encourage better^production and collection of indigenous food resources. The immediate aim mustIbe to raise the ration from the present level of about 1,400-1,450 calories (1,550 lofficial scale) to an effective 1,800 calories as soon as the world food supply posi-jtion makes this possible. Unfortunately the supply prospects in the next fewjmonths are far from encouraging. In present circumstances, the main respon-isibility in connexion with the import of food and raw materials must rest with[the Americans. As stated in the recently concluded fusion agreement, HisjMajesty&apos;s Government^ responsibility is limited to those supplies whicb can[be procured within the sterling area. We must, however, ensure that our obliga-jtions under the Fusion Agreement are punctually fulfilled.18. Furthermore as a long-term objective we should aim at reversing thepresent procedure under which we and the Americans undertake in effect toprovide and pay for whatever supplies of essential food-stuffs are needed tomaintain a minimum standard of living. The present practice removes fromthe Germans themselves any incentive to improve their own lot by increasingexports, since any such increase would at present serve mainly to relieve theburden on the British and American taxpayer. By reversing the procedure andfixing the amount of American (and British) supplies at a definite figure fora reasonable period ahead, the Germans would be given a powerful incentive toincrease production and to step up exports in order to acquire additional food-stuffs and other consumer goods from abroad in order to improve their ownstandard of living. This would also be much the most effective way of impressingon the Germans the necessity in their own interests of improving their ownadministrative machinery and of dealing energetically with the black market.Trade between the Bizonal Area and the Eastern Zone and Iron Curtain States19. The bizonal area will continue to be extremely short of food, even ifthe indigenous resources are increased. On the other hand, the Eastern zone and the Iron Curtain countries are in urgent need of steel and manufactured products from the Ruhr. I think that all possible steps should be taken toincrease trade across the Iron Curtain and that there should be the maximumexchange of goods between Eastern and Western Germany. The recently con-cluded Anglo-Soviet trade agreement has had a good effect in Germany andthere would be every advantage if the programme recently agreed on for trade between the Soviet Zone and the Combined Zones were to be increased. quite apart from the economic benefit which this will bring to Western Germany, thepolitical effect should be excellent and will tend to minimise the effects of the separation of the Eastern Zone from the rest of Germany.Reparations20. The fact that there was general acceptance at the Council of foreign ministers of the figure of 11-5 million tons for the permitted steel production for the whole of Germany (equivalent to the Anglo-American figure of lO - 7 million tons for the bizonal area) should reduce the criticism of our reparations plan.We should continue to insist on the firm implementation of this plan despite the suggestions that are now being made in the United States Congress thatdismantling should cease. The programme of dismantling will not interferewith the re-establishment of a peaceful economy in Germany, and will appre-ciably accelerate the recovery of several of the recipient nations. Our obligations to the I.A.RA. Powers, the requirements of security and our own materialinterests require that the reparations plan be carried out. We must, however,continue our efforts to accelerate the procedure. Mr. Marshall told me just before he left for Washington that the United States Government intended to suspendreparations deliveries from the American Zone, to Russia, and although I didmy best to persuade him of the unwisdom of this policy I expect that the UnitedStates Government will soon ask us to take similar action in the British Zone.No doubt the Russian refusal to implement certain of the Potsdam provisionsgives us adequate justification for suspending deliveries to the U.S.S.R. (thoughthe suspension of deliveries to her satellites would be a clear breach of our obliga-tions under the Paris Act). But reparations are a matter on which the Russians
are most sensitive and they would almost certainly regard a definite suspension of deliveries as marking a final breach between East and West. I feel that itwould be most unwise to take such action, especially at a time when we do not want to give the Russians any excuse for making the Allied position in Berlinstill more difficult. Moreover, such action would raise many technical and legal difficulties and prejudice the interests of the Western Governments who areentitled to certain reciprocal deliveries of materials made by Russia in returnfor these reparations deliveries from the West. I feel, therefore, that we shouldcontinue to resist any proposal that we should suspend deliveries to the SovietGovernment (and a fortiori to the Soviet satellites). If, however, the UnitedStates Government press us very hard and if it becomes apparent that a refusalon our part to co-operate with them may mean that Congress will decline to vote the money necessary to finance the supplies for the Anglo-American Zone,we may have to give way. But in that event we should try to secure that the americans (as indeed is believed to be their present intention) agree that onlythe actual delivery of the plant should be suspended i.e., it should be allocated to Russia, dismantled and then packed and stored in Germany, and not leftstanding undismantled. I shall, however, offer the most stubborn resistance even to this arrangement. The Potsdam Agreement on capital reparations was aspecial issue separate from the other Potsdam decisions. It was reached on an american proposal and was intended to wind up the Three Power reparations commission. It would, I am sure, only reopen the wider and much more dangerousissue of current reparations to go back now on what had been agreed for capitalreparations.Attitude of the French21. One of the principal results of the Council of Foreign Ministers (and ofother recent events in France) is that the French have now finally ceased theirattempt to act as a bridge between the Soviet Government on the one hand and the americans and ourselves on the other in German matters. Up till the recent meeting French divergences had been a serious inconvenience, though I fullyrealise that these arose largely from the difficult position in which they were placedand from fears for French security. They do not, however, agree even now withthe Americans or ourselves on a number of matters. On the political side theycertainly favour a more decentralised system than either we or the Americansthink possible or desirable. Though they have accepted an annual steel productionof 11-5 million tons per annum in Germany they still have doubts about someaspects of the level of German industry, they continue to strive for international control of the Ruhr and they are far from satisfied with their allocation of german coal. Now that they are in clear opposition to Soviet designs in Germany, theymay be expected to be more suspicious on matters of security than before.Moreover, the economic situation in the French Zone is far from easy. For thelast two years they have made overall a considerable profit out of the zone, andhave certainly not been called upon to put any money into it. Recently, however,the balance has turned against them and they will have to provide economic assistance to the French Zone in the same way as we and the Americans have throughout done to our zones.22. Long before the Conference opened, the French indicated that if therewas failure to reach agreement they would wish to discuss bringing their zoneinto the fusion arrangements. Though they have reached no final &quot;decision, this isstill their attitude, but they have made it clear that they regard the question oftrizonal fusion as being bound up with the other economic, political arid securityproblems of Western Europe, and they are unwilling to consider it in isolation. Itis important to note, however, that from the point of view of pure expediency inGermany itself, there is no great urgency to bring the French in to the bizonalarrangements. On purely administrative grounds trizonal fusion will be no moredifficult to work than bizonal fusion; and since the French Zone is no longer self-supporting, the economic situation of the. bizonal area will not be improved bythe addition of the French Zone.23. On general political grounds, however, there is no doubt that it isdesirable for the French Zone to be added to the other two zones, and I am anxious that discussions for this purpose should begin soon. The Americans holdmuch the same views. Our position in these discussions is an important thoughdelicate one. On the one hand the French are our Allies and it is greatly to our interest that they should be associated willingly with the, arrangements in western germany. Apart from the positive benefits to be gained from French co-operation
to have them in and to make them take responsibility for the political andeconomic difficulties with which we and the Americans are faced in western germany will remove a source of constant friction between ourselves and theFrench and prevent them adopting an unduly critical attitude. On the other hand we are partners with the Americans, and in the financial sense the junior partner.We cannot, therefore, act independently of the Americans without running therisk of causing serious misunderstanding. Our role, therefore, will have to be oneof persuading the French to take a reasonable and sensible attitude, particularly as regards the political organisation in Western Germany, and at the same timeof preventing the Americans becoming exasperated Avith French claims. In other words we have the task of introducing a friendly but sometimes difficult newpartner into a firm where our present partner is at times liable to take anindependent line.24. The actual discussions with the French will centre round two main points, namely trizonal fusion and security questions.25. Trizonal fusion has economic and political aspects, but for the present is to a great extent a technical matter. My proposal is that the French should beinvited to put themselves in touch with the British and American authorities inBerlin with a view to acquainting themselves thoroughly with the present bizonalarrangements. They could be. given a copy of the new fusion agreement and invited to comment upon it and to suggest how it might be adapted so as to enablethe French to come in. Our officials in Berlin would keep in close touch with theForeign Office and would not reach any hard and fast agreement with the Frenchat the present stage and before I have had an opportunity to consult my colleaguesagain.26. The security questions cover a wide field. The French are disturbedabout the possibility of their joining the bizonal area without any guarantee ofwhat would happen if that area were to be subjected to military or other heavy pressure from the East. They visualise a possible clash in Western Europearising from the present tension between the great Powers, and they consider thatthey would be the principal sufferers. They cannot withdraw from Europe as is open to the Americans, and to a lesser degree ourselves. The French need securitynot only against a resurgent Germany in the future but also against the soviet union, which might push aggressive communism so far as to lead&apos; to war. TheFrench are really concerned about the possibility that France may be faced withthe danger of attack by the Red army. If we are to carry the French with us inthe reconstruction of Western Europe and in our German policy, we must try tosatisfy them on this score.   They visualise security under three main aspects : (a) territorial guarantees.(b) Anglo-French staff talks.(c) The Ruhr.27.   As regards these my proposal is : (a) Territorial guarantees. We should begin by discussing very privatelyand informally with the Americans how best to meet the Frenchrequirements as regards security. We may have to consider, in con-jtinction with the Americans, a new three-Power treaty which wouldguarantee the trizonal area from attack from any quarter.(b) Staff talks. We have agreed that General Revers, the French Chief ofStaff, should shortly visit this country in order to establish contact.The talks will be limited on this occasion to questions of armyreorganisation and equipment.(c) The Ruhr. The French have always maintained that the eventual peace treaty with Germany should lay down a special regime for the Ruhrwhich would ensure that the industry shall remain under Allied controland that the territory shall continue to be occupied by Allied forces.It will be necessary in due course to debate this very difficult question with the French but as there is no urgency we shall try at this stage to confine our discussions on the Ruhr to the immediate economic problems involved and which are dealt with in the following paragraph.The Ruhr28.   Underlying the whole of the discussions at the last two sessions of theCouncil of Foreign Ministers has been the question of the Ruhr. I have throughout84749 c
refused to allow the Russians to participate in any special control of the Ruhrunless true and genuine unity was first established in Germany. I think thatevents have shown this policy to have been correct. Apart from the Russians,however, the French are deeply interested in the Ruhr, and have not abandonedtheir idea that it should be subjected to a special international regime. We andthe Americans, however, feel that there is no reason to establish a special securityregime in the Ruhr at the present time. The area is safely occupied by Britishtroops and is under joint Anglo-American economic control. So long as theoccupation lasts, there is no reason to establish an international force there.To do so, moreover, at this stage, would have a very bad effect indeed on theGermans. The political situation in Western Germany is delicate and unformed,and it would cause serious misunderstanding at the very least among the Germansif an international regime were now to be proposed. More important is thefact that, despite a setback in December, coal production has increased in the Ruhrin the last few months, and nothing could in my view be more calculated to retarda further increase, and in fact to ensure a substantial decrease, than any sugges-tion that the Ruhr was to be made subject to a special political regime. TheGermans would regard it as the first step towards the separation of the Ruhrfrom the rest of Germany, to which they would never, I am convinced, agree, andto which I have always been opposed.29. It is of course another matter to deal with the question of the Ruhras part of the problem of trizonal fusion. When discussions on trizonal fusionhave begun, the questions of the economic controls over production, &amp;c, in the ruhr will arise automatically. There is no reason that I can see to prevent ourgiving the French a good deal of satisfaction on this aspect of the matter, since they will, as one of the partners in the new trizonal fusion arrangements, beentitled to their share of the economic control in that area. We and the Americansagree that the conversations at a Government level on the long-range aspectsof the German problems should include the Ruhr but that any tentative agreementwith respect to the Ruhr would be contingent on agreement on the other aspectsof the German settlement.The Saar30. At the Council of Foreign Ministers we and the United States Delega-tion agreed to the French claim for the economic integration of the Saar intothe French economy. Our consent has always been conditional upon the exactdelimitation of the frontiers (which has virtually been done) and an adjustment of the French reparations claim upon Germany. This latter point remains for settlement and we are now awaiting proposals from the French. The americans have added another condition, namely, that the French should bring their zone intothe bizonal arrangements. It is important to clear this question of the Saar upas soon as possible. I propose, therefore that we should now consult the americans and see how we can best make progress without sacrificing our own interests to those of the French. It is obvious that this question must be settledbefore we can deal with further French claims, e.g., about the Ruhr and, providedthat a settlement can be reached without undue delay, it will not be necessaryto make any special arrangements in the meantime for trade between the combinedzone on the one hand and the Saar and the remainder of the French zone on theother. When the Saar is finally integrated into the French economy, it will of course have to be treated as part of France for purposes of trade with the combined zone and such trade will cease to be on a reichsmark basis.Probable Attitude of the United States31. After the end of the Conference I had two discussions withMr. Marshall before he returned to America, and the results of these on suchmatters as the political organisation of Western Germany, financial reform, &amp;c,are reflected in what has been said above. One of the difficulties of dealing withthe Americans in all these matters is that although the State Department retainsresponsibility in German policy, responsibility for American administration inGermany rests with the War Department. This Department takes a very narrowview of its responsibility and is very liable to be influenced solely by financialmotives and congressional opinion. Broadly speaking, the Americans seemdetermined to make a success of Western Germany, since they regard this as oneof the pillars of the Marshall Plan. On many matters I expect that they willbe truculent with the Russians, particularly if the latter try and force the western allies out of Berlin.   I should expect them on the whole to be sympathetic to the
French claims for security, but to be unsympathetic to the French on economic matters, particularly if the latter attempt to drive too hard a bargain. Theremay be pressure from time to time in Congress or in the War Department for the americans to take over a larger share of responsibility for policy in western germany as a whole because they are shouldering the larger financial burden. I donot expect, however, that this will prove a serious threat. The pressure seems tocome from those quarters which are either naturally anti-british or which knowlittle about the situation in Germany. It will probably be best to leave present arrangements more or less untouched, under which the two Commanders-in-Chieftry and settle the maximum of administrative and other purely German questionsbetween themselves, leaving only the larger issues, particularly those with inter-national implications, for settlement between Mr. Marshall and myself.Probable Soviet A attitude.32. This is a very difficult question. The sudden end of the conference I am&apos;sure caught M. Molotov unawares. The Russians did not want a break, but wouldhave preferred to prolong the existing situation which effectively prevents theWestern Powers from pressing on with the economic and political recovery of western Germany. Apart from the question of Berlin, which is separately dis-cussed, I think we can anticipate that so far as the Western Zones are concerned the Russians will increase their efforts at penetration. There is likely to be an increasing volume of propaganda aimed at the alleged misdeeds of the western powers, stressing that the Soviet Government alone are the friends of the Germanpeople and the champions of German unity. The Communist Party will no doubt be built up, but I expect that political penetration will be mainly attemptedthrough non-political organisations, particularly the trade unions, work councils,and youth and women&apos;s organisations. Every step we take will be represented asa breach of Four-Power agreement and there will, I expect, be attempts to fosterstrikes and perhaps more serious disturbances for political reasons. The situa-tion must be very carefully watched and T am putting forward in a separate paperan account of Communist activities in the British Zone. The best answer, how-ever, to all Soviet and Communist propaganda and political warfare will bethe speedy economic recovery of Western Germany. In the Eastern Zone Ianticipate that pressure is now being exercised on the C.D.U., a matter to whichI refer in my paper to the Cabinet on Communist activities.33. The difficult question is whether the Russians will come to establish aseparate Government for the Eastern Zone of Germany, or even a Governmentpurporting to be the &quot; Government for all Germany.&quot; There is no doubt thatthey already have the means to do either of these things and that their plans are ready. They have a number of Germans, both politicians and officials, who couldstaff a Government, and the highly centralised system which has existed for sometime in the Eastern Zone could be adapted very rapidly to fit into the require-ments of a Government either of Eastern Germany or of &quot; all Germany.&quot; Thereis a further question whether, if they do decide to establish such a Government,they will set it up in Berlin or Leipzig or some other place. I cannot give the answer to this question with any certainty. On balance I think that the Russians willset up a separate Government in the Eastern Zone but will not do so at once. Theywill probably wait a little and see whether we and the Americans attempt to enlarge the Frankfurt organisation into a Government, or whether we make anyother dramatic move in Western Germany. If they see that we do not intend toact in this way, they will seize on some comparatively small matter and use it asjustification for establishing a separate Government in the Eastern Zone. Againwithout pretending to be certain, I think it more likely that such a Governmentwill be established in Leipzig ^or some other place outside Berlin rather than inBerlin itself. I think the Russians would feel that to establish a government at once in Berlin would be too direct a challenge to the other Occupying Powersand would also unduly handicap that Government in its early stages. I think they would prefer the secrecy which they could obtain in some other town thanBerlin, and will want to give their stooge Government a chance to gain some experience before it attempts to represent itself as the Government of all Germany.Our Position in Berlin34. The Russians are most anxious to get the three Western Powers out of berlin because they now appreciate that our continued presence there will be fatal to any plans which they may have for the political assimilation of theEastern Zone.  On the other hand, there are considerable difficulties before them.
To squeeze us out by direct pressure on our communications or by cutting off our supplies in Berlin would be very risky, since in the long run it would almost certainly create a serious situation with the Americans which might, in certaincircumstances, lead to war. Nor do we consider it likely that the Russians would wish at present to shoulder the very heavy commitment in supplies of coal and food to our sector which we now carry. The Russians also lean heavily on suppliesof steel from the Ruhr and have not abandoned hope of eventually obtainingsome reparations from the Western Zones. As against this our personal relationswith the Russians in Berlin have recently deteriorated, and there have beeuseveral incidents, such as the ejection of Dr. Kaiser from the leadership of the christian Democrats in the Eastern Zone and the renewal of activity against theSocialists in the Soviet Sector, to show that the war of nerves has already started.For the time being, however, my feeling and it is little more than a guess isthat the Russians will avoid pushing things to extremes for the present. In myopinion it is more likely that they will pursue their tactics of undermining us with the Germans in order to make our position in Berlin as uncomfortable aspossible, and. ultimately to convince us that we should lose more face by stayingon in the city than by evacuating it.E.
