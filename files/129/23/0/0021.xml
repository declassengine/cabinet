V   164[s DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS britannic MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)SECRET COPY NO. 30O.P.(48) 21^6TH JANUARY,  1948.CABINETORDERING OF AIRCRAFT FOR THE AIRWAYS CORPORATIONSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council when the Cabinet,  on 15th January (CM. (48) 4thConclusions, Minute 2),  discussed the Report of the Tudor IEnquiry,  I undertook to report to the Cabinet the conclusions reached by the Socialisation of Industries Committee at ameeting held to-day to discuss the procedure for the orderingof aircraft for the Airways Corporations.2. The designing and development of new types of aircraftoccupies several years.      Core has,  therefore, to be token toensure that all relevant considerations hove been borne inmind in the framing of aircraft requirements and specifications.This is the function of the Civil Aircraft requirements committee on which the three Airways Corporations, the ministries of Civil Aviation and Supply and the Treasury orerepresented.      The present procedure is that the Ministry ofSupply then make arrangements for the designing of aircraft to conform with the performance specifications and they finance the construction of prototypes.      Originally the Ministry ofSupply ordered the aircraft in its finally agreed form;    but,under the Prime Minister&apos;s directive of 11th September,  1946,they now do this as the agent of the Airways Corporations,who are made financially responsible.3. The present procedure is not working in a satisfactorymanner.      The Ministry of Supply find the positionunsatisfactory, because the three Airways Corporations do not co-operate willingly in the arrangement under which they haveto employ the Ministry of Supply as their agent in orderingsircraft.      There is disagreement about the details of the relationship of principal ana agent.      The general circumstancessre also unsatisfactory,  since, for a variety of reasons,there is little chance that any new type of aircraft, affordingeconomical operation, will be available before 1953*k&apos; The Minister of Supply suggested that a CivilAviation Authority should be set up, with operating concernsas subordinate units.     The Civil Aviation iiUthority wouldfork in close touch with the Ministry of Supply and would order the aircraft which it considered necessary.      It would be thebusiness of the operating units to fly these aircraft.     Thegeneral organisation would beer some resemblance in the civilfield to the Air Ministry with its subordinate commands.-1-
5. The Minister of Civil Aviation objected to the conception of a Civil Aviation Authority and proposed thatthe defects in the present organisation should he remediedby &quot;modifications which would leave its    essential structureintact.      In particular,  he suggested that the three airways corporations should set up an Aircraft Procurement agency in order to ensure that they formulated one set of requirements for basic types for common use.     He also proposed to strengthen the Civil Aircraft requirements committee in various ways and to set up a progressing sub-committee of that body which would be responsible for theprogress of each type planned in the programme.      Finally,tie suggested that, while the Minister of Supply should issueagreed design requirements to the industry and should orderprototypes, the Corporations should place their awnproduction orders for the aircraft as finally accepted.6. The general feeling among members of the socialisation of Industries Committee was that,  quite apart from merits,  itwas not practicable to make radical changes at this stage inthe pattern of airline organisation laid down in the CivilAviation Act,  I9I4.6.      The three Airways Corporations have onlyteen in Toeing for eighteen months and the present arrangements must he given a fair trial.      In any event,  some members of theCommittee were not persuaded that the organisation proposedby the Minister of Supply would produce efficient results in the highly competitive business of airline operation.The general consensus of opinion was, therefore,  that thegeneral organisation of civil aviation should remain as laiddown in the Civil Aviation Act,&quot; 19h6T subject to the settingup by the three Corporations of the Aircraft ProcurementAgency proposed by the Minister of Civil Aviation, on thedesirability of which all members of the. Committee were agreed.7i The arrangements for ordering designs,  prototypes and production types of aircraft raise a host of inter-relatedproblems,  including difficult questions of finance andaccounting, which cannot he adequately investigated by a ministerial committee.      Moreover,  the Airways Corporationshave views on these metters and should be heard.      the socialisation of Industries Committee accordingly suggestthat an independent Committee of Enquiry should be set upto recommend what arrangements should Toe mode which would meet the needs of the Government&quot;,  the three Airways Corporationsend the aircraft manufacturers in this field.      The Committeeshould be small in&quot;.size and should- include one or two persons with business and accounting experience.      It should be askedto make its recommendations within two or three months.      TheAirways Corporations should be informed of the Government&apos;intention to set up 0 Committee of Enquiry and they should beasked to co-operate in its work.      In any public statement about the Committee&apos;s work,  the Government should ovoidlanguage which would suggest that the Committee will produce2 written report for publication.H.M.Office of the Lord President of the Council,S. W.. 1 .16th January,  19h8.
