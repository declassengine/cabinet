iiIS DOOUlDL-iT IS TH&apos;i&apos;J PROPERTY OF HIS BRITAJOIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)3 3 C R E TCP.(1+8)9^TH JANUARY,  19U8CABINETAUSTRIAMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs*I am reporting separately on that part of our reoentnegotiations which concern Austria,  since there is no 1    ,eiany necessary connexion between the Austrian and Germanquestions.2.      I am glad to say that the outcome of the Gonferen- e ofForeign Ministers has not &quot;been of so final or critical a character as far as Austria is concerned,  and I have somehope that we have at last laid the basis of progress on theAustrian Treaty.   &quot; But the Austrian question is clearly onlyone aspect of the general European situation and it would beoptimistic to expect the Russians to .give way over Austriaas long as they are maintaining the maximum tension betweeneast and west.3.    , As the Cabinet will recall from the report which I madeon my return from the Moscow Conference on 2nd May, 191+7 .(0*M. (h7)U3rd. Conclusions, Minute 1), as well as from the-, paper which.I circulated to the Overseas Reconstruction Committeein November (O.R.C. (1+7)1+7) the main obstacle to the conclusionof a Treaty has been the question of German assets,  and the magnitude of the Soviet claims in that respect.      The basictrouble was always the refusal of the Soviet to make clear in concrete terms what their demands- were.      A French initiativeto settle the.question on a practical basis in terms of figuresfailed at first to gain Soviet acceptance,  since Mr.  Molotovwas plainly determined not to come any way to meet us overAustria until he saw where he stood in Germany.      Thus, when the breakdown of the Conference over the German.question was already evident, and Mr.  Marshall had in fact proposed itsadjournment, the problem of Austria was left in the air.To avoid this,  I made a last&apos; minute proposal that the Austrian treaty should be referred back to the Deputies in the hopethat some agreement might still emerge.      This was promptlytaken up by Mr.  Molotov, who came out - for the first time -with a definite claim in the field of oil, to which the Sovietseem to attach principal importance.      The figure for his claim - two thirds of both the oil production capacity and the oil exploration areas in Eastern Austria - is a very high one,COPY NO.
&quot;but at any rate it is a figure and we must take it intoaccount.k.      Accordingly I agreed on behalf of the United kingdom delegation that the Soviet proposal,  together with theFrench proposal I have already mentioned,  should be referredto the Deputies.      The latter duly held a further meeting,in the course of which the Soviet member promised to submit,by the beginning of January, proposals for the other categories of German assets - oil distribution and refining,Danube Shipping and a proposed &quot;lump sum&quot; payment to be madein kind over a period of years.      When this is received,t he  Deputies will arrange a further session,  and I verymuch hope that, now we have some prospect of discussing this problem in terms of figures and amounts,  the possibility ofagreement may be nearer.      1 pressed Mr.  Marshall, before he left London,  to give full and prompt consideration to anySoviet proposal, which provided a basis for resumingnegotiations.      Provided the ultimate will to agree exists onthe Soviet side,  there is really no reason why the Austrian treaty should not be concluded in a short time:    certainlyHis Majesty&apos;s Government have long demonstrated their desire for an early Treaty,  followed by the withdrawal of occupyingarmies from Austria.      The United States and French Governmentsalso desire to reach a settlement.5.      I trust therefore that the Cabinet will approve ray-initiative in keeping the matter open.      At the very least,we have shown clearly our resolve to keep the solution ofthe Austrian question independent of the settlement on germany.      That alone I conside a substantial advance.E.B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1.UTH JANUARY,  19U8.
