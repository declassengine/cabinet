S   document  is  the property  of his  britannic  majestvs  governmentPrinted for the Cabinet. December 1947SECRETCopy No. j 0 6D.O. (47) 9724th December, 1947CABINETDefence CommitteeDEFENCE ESTIMATES 1948-49Memorandum by Minister of defence In my memorandum on Defence Requirements (D.O. (47) 68) I made proposals which were accepted by the Defence Committee and subsequently by theCabinet for the man-power strength of the Services during the financial year1948-49. At the same time, I gave a tentative indication of the probable total ofthe defence budget for 1948-49, which I then put in the neighbourhood of 710 million, including terminals.2. On the basis of the man-power figures approved by the Cabinet, theService Departments have made a more detailed examination of their financialrequirements for the next financial year. Their results have been closelyscrutinised by the Ministry of Defence, and I am now in a position to lay beforemy colleagues a revised defence budget for 1948-49.3. The assumptions on which this budget has been prepared remain thosestated in paragraph 8 of D.O&apos;. (47) 68, which were approved by the Cabinet. Ithas also been assumed that the commitments of the forces will remain as foreseenwhen D.O. (47) 68 was prepared, but recent political developments are likely to cause some variation. For example, it now appears very doubtful whether british forces will be out of Austria, Trieste, and Greece by the end. of the current financial year. Moreover, the decision to evacuate Palestine has made it necessaryto plan a complete redeployment of our forces in the Middle East, the financialand administrative effects of which cannot yet be accurately calculated.4. The defence budget for 1948--49 should be judged on its own merits asdesigned to meet the needs of the next financial year, and not as a part of a long-term plan for peace-time expenditure on the Armed Forces. It must be rememberedthat we are still far from being rid of the liabilities which have fallen upon us as a direct outcome of the war and the process of reconversion to peace. Ouroccupational commitments remain; it seems clear that we shall have to retainBritish forces in Germany for a very long period, and, as I have already men-tioned, we shall probably have troops in Austria, Greece, and Trieste for much longer than we had hoped. In addition, the further speed-up of release from theforces approved by the Cabinet when the Service man-power figures for 1948-49were settled will maintain the figure of terminal expenditure at a high level, andthe more rapid release of trained men will impose a still further burden on theService training organisations.5. In accordance with the principles and assumptions stated in paragraph 8of D.O. (47) 68, and which I have since broadly indicated in Parliament, first priority has been given to provision for defence research and development.6. In the interests of economic recovery the Service production programmeshave again been severely limited. For the most part they are confined to main-tenance requirements, and even less provision will be made in 1948-49 formodernisation and re-equipment than was made in the current financial year.34713-2B
Man-Power(i) Service Man-Power7 The following table shows the strength of the forces at 31st March, 1948and 31st March, 1949, which was approved by the Cabinet on 2nd October, 1947(CM. (47) 78th Meeting):- -v       v   &apos; 81st March,        31st March,1948 1949Navv .........      147,000 147,000Army       &quot;        ........      527,000* 339,000*Air Force......... 263,000 227,000Total    .........      937,000 713,000(ii) Civilian Man-Power8. In addition to uniformed personnel, the Services make a large call onthe nation&apos;s man-power in the form of the civilians they employ, both directly intheir administrative and production establishments and indirectly on their production and research and development contracts. As my colleagues willknow, it was decided a few months ago by the Prime Minister that theServices&apos; man-power ceilings should in future comprehend both uniformedpersonnel and civilians, in order both to present a clearer picture of the total demand made on the nation&apos;s man-power by the Services and also to enable a closer control to be effected over defence inan-power. Hitherto Service Depart-ment civilians have been included in the Civilian Staff returns with all other government employees; in future, civilian man-power engaged, directly on defence work will be treated as a component part of the Forces&apos; total man-power ceiling.Within this combined ceiling of uniformed personnel and civilian employees foreach Service, there will be some interchangeability possible between uniformedand civilian personnel, though the former will always be subject to the yearlymaxima represented by the Vote A figure for each Service. In Appendix I to this paper are set out the ceiling figures for each Service at the beginning, middle and end of the coming financial year, on which the*Service Estimates are based.9. I realise the urgent need for reducing the number of the civilianemployees of the Services, a question which is receiving the close attention of theHome Secretary&apos;s Civil Service Man-power Committee as part of its examinationof the whole field of Government staffing. It should be borne in mind, however,that the run-down of civilians cannot proceed at the same pace as the run-down of uniformed personnel, since the processes of the release of uniformed personnel,e.g., terminal benefits, pay accounts, &amp;c, have very largely to be carried out bycivilian-staffed branches. I ask for the general approval of the DefenceCommittee to the combined military and civilian man-power ceiling figures foreach of the Services as set out in Part II of Appendix I.Finance10. When I presented the 1947-48 Defence Estimates to the DefenceCommittee I drew attention to the fact that they included substantial expenditure for civilian purposes, such as research and development on account of civilaviation, pay and maintenance of Poles and of prisoners of war, and the cost ofadministration of occupied territories. Similar provision has, of necessity, hadto be made in the Estimates for 1948-49, but. on this occasion, I have excludedfrom my defence budget any provision for civil aviation research and development.The Ministry of Supply requirement under this head amounts to no less a totalthan  12 million. As this is not in any sense Defence expenditure, I feel thatit would be entirely wrong to include it. We can, if necessary, consider at a later stage whether any reference should be made to it in the Defence White Paper.I have also omitted the Ministry of Supply requirement for atomic energyresearch and development and production. Even so, the Estimates now putforward include, under the other headings mentioned above, nearly  11 million which would more properly be classed as civil expenditure.In mentioning the figure of  711 million in paragraph 15 of D.O. (47) 68,I made it clear that it was no more than a very tentative forecast of the financial provision that would require to be made for defence purposes in 1948-49. Infact, when the Service Departments and Ministry of Supply had completed their detailed examination after the man-power totals had been settled and the* Excludes 5,000 boys.
planning assumptions and principles governing the preparation of the Estimateshad been approved, the following revised figures were submitted to me:   million160316183 -763 - 5 (excluding atomic energy and civilaviation)Total...............      723-211. It has always been my view that, if at all possible, the Defence budget for 1948-49 should be reduced below  700 million, and in the past few days theChancellor of the Exchequer has informed me that from his point of view this isessential, and that, if necessary, risks should be taken in order to get down tothis target. After the most careful examination, I am satisfied that the programmes upon which the Service Departments and the Ministry of Supplyhave based their financial calculations are reasonable in themselves and containnothing but really essential requirements. Elimination of requirements istherefore not a possible means of achieving further economy, and I have concentrated my efforts on achieving the largest possible estimating cuts. Bythis means I have secured the agreement of the Service Ministers and the Ministerof Supply to the following revised figures :   millionNavy       .................. 153Army      .................. 305Air        ...      ............... 173Ministry of Supply     ...      ...      ...      ... 61Total...............      69212. I must emphasise that in order to attain these figures it has been necessary to take very considerable risks, and I am bound to warn my colleagues that should these mature against us, or should we be faced with additional commitments which have not been taken into account in preparing the estimates,I shall be compelled to seek authority for reasonable Supplementary Estimates.The Chancellor of the Exchequer has informed me that he is prepared to accept this risk in order to achieve the lowest possible figures now.13. To the total of  692 million there should be added   - 6 million on accountof the Ministry of Defence, whose estimate for 1948-49 will be a Defence andnot a Civil Estimate. The increase over the estimate of   - 4 million for the current year is almost entirely due to the transfer from Service Votes of expenditureon the staffs of Combined Operations Headquarters, the Imperial DefenceCollege, and the Joint Services Staff College.14.   With this addition, the total defence budget becomes  692-6 million.15. In order to meet the views expressed by the Cabinet when the 1947-48Estimates wex^e being considered (CM. (47) 10th Meeting), I have had preparedan elaboration of the breakdown of expenditure under Economic Survey headings,which will enable Ministers more readily to compare the expenditure of theService Departments on corresponding items. This breakdown is attached as appendix II. Particulars of the Ministry of Supply expenditure are shownseparately in Appendix III.Terminals16. The forecast which I made in D.O. (47) 68 has proved to be on the highside; the terminal expenditure in 1948-49 will amount to about  60 million, ascompared with the figure for 1947-48 of  118&apos;5 million. The main cause of the continuing high expenditure on terminals is the acceleration of release which isnecessary in order to reduce the forces to a strength of 713,000 at the &quot;end of thefinancial year. Terminal expenditure should show a sharp decline after this date.34713-2 b 2NavyArmy   ...Air     ......Ministry of Supply
Overseas Expenditure17. The amount of overseas expenditure for which provision is made in these estimates is extremely difficult to assess. Very broadly, I estimate that it will amount to about  75 million (including all imported oil, wherever consumed, but excluding food obtained through the United Kingdom import programme). Mucbwill, however, depend upon the progress of redeployment in the Middle East.Practically all local overseas expenditure will be incurred in the sterling area.Production and Research and Development18. The financial provision for these items is based upon the programmes and estimates which are set out in full in the Enclosures to the Report by theDefence Production Committee circulated as D.O. (47) 98 * The production pro-grammes have as last year been collated by the Joint War Production Staff, andthe research and development estimates have been scrutinised by the defence research Policy Committee.As research and development work carries the highest priority, no reductionsother than estimating cuts have been made in the estimates approved by theDefence Research Policy Committee, but staff shortages and dimculties in pro-progressing new works projects will limit the amount of effort that can be put into certain highly important fields.The production programmes have been severely restricted, not only by thenecessity to free the national resources as far as possible for other purposes, butby the general financial limits within which the 1948-49 Estimates have had tobe framed. The financial provision in the Estimates on account of production hasbeen most rigidly pruned to take account of probable underspending.Works19. The Service works programmes for 1948-49 are being made the subjectof special scrutiny by my Department, in conjunction with the three service departments and the Treasury. A review of the overseas works programmes has just been completed, and I hope to send the Chancellor of the Exchequer a reportvery shortly. The works programmes in the United Kingdom will, in accordancewith the- recommendations of the Investment Programmes Committee (I.P.C.(47) 9), be examined to ensure a proper balance between the relative demands ofthe three Services for building labour and to ensure the best results for defence as a whole. The share of the general housing programme which should be allocated to the provision of married quarters for the Services is under discussion between my Department and the Ministry of Health.Recommendations20.   I ask my colleagues (i) To accept for the purpose of the Service Estimates for 1948-49 a totalexpenditure of  692-6 million, divided between Departments asfollows :   millionAdmiraltyWar Office   .....Air ministry ministry of Supply ..Ministry of Defence153305173610-6Total       ............       692-and to.note that should the risks which have been taken in reducingthe Estimates to this figure mature, or should additional commitmentsarise during the year which have not been taken into account in theirpreparation, it may be necessary to bring forward supplementary estimates.(ii) To note that the details of the Estimates will continue to be the subjectof further close examination by my Department in consultation withthe Service Departments and Ministry of Supply,(iii) To approve, for planning purposes, the man-power ceilings proposed inAppendix I.A.
