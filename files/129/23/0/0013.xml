In the case of some of the materials,  e.g. timber,  there ore stocks from which allocationsare made and the troubles associated with the ordering and delivery of fabricated material,  such as steel,  do not arise.Per other materials, while it is necessary to retain an allocation system so as to ensure supplies for the mostimportant users, little difficulty arises in honouring the allocations that are made.3. At the official level the departments principally concerned are agreed that, with the exception of iron castings,which are closely allied to steel and to which the steelpriority system could conveniently be adapted, it is unnecessary to superimpose any priority arrangements on thepresent allocation procedure.4* The P.M.L.  symbol has also been used by departments and within industry to obtain priority in the supply of a wide variety of components and common service items for programmes which contribute to the expansion of fuel and power resources.While this&apos;use of the P.M.L.  symbol has served its original purpose in stimulating fuel expansion schemes, there is nodoubt that it has caused confusion in industry and has impededother production programmes.      Some of these other programmes,including the export industries,  ship building and import saving industries such as agriculture, 3re now of equalimportance.     The &quot;P.M.L. symbol has been used by purchasers-1-
^with an indirect,  and frequently very remote, connectionwith fuel expansion as a convenient means of hasteningdelivery, and by suppliers as a ready excuse for inability to meet other orders.5- officials of the departments mainly concerned,therefore,  unanimously recommend the early cancellation ofI the use of p.m.l.  priority for components, common serviceitems and materials other than steel and iron castings.given suitable guidance, industry could do much to ensurethat important programmes are not held up for lack ofcomponents, and progressing action by and between departmentssponsoring the buyer end suppliers respectively should suffice to overcome exceptional cases of difficulty.6. the central economic planning staff will consider any particular cases of conflict of interest between two ormore departments which cannot be settled by mutual agreement.it will be necessary for departments carefully to examine&quot;requests from industry for ad hoc assistance in obtaining supplies of materials or components.7. in order to make the system flexible and efficient,however, it is most desirable that there should be anopportunity both t    add new items to the list to whichpriority attaches and to remove from it those which havediminished in importance,      i ask my colleagues for authorityto make such changes in future as circumstances seem to meto require, after consultation with ministers concerned.8. the ministry of labour have    taken account ofp.m.l.  priority in working their preference machinery v/hichis operated in full consultation with the departmentsconcerned and the -central economic planning staff.      i see no reason to alter these arrangements.the application of w.b.a.  priority in the buildingfield has already been dealt with (cp. (1+7) 329 and 33h).9. it will be necessary for same explanation of thegovernment&apos;s intention to be made and i propose to make astatement at an early&apos; press conference.10. my proposals are thus:-(i)    that the p.m.l.  symbol shall,  in future, apply only to steel and iron castings.(ii)    that i shall have authority to revise as isnecessary the list of programmes in connectionwith&apos; v/hich the use of the p.m.l.  symbol is authorised.(iii)    that the arrangements for labour priority shall remain unchanged.P. s. 0.treasury chambers, s.w.1.9th january, 19h8.
annex draft STATEMENT ON PRIORITIESDuring and since the war on essential feature ofthe national economy has been the control by allocation,and sometimes by a priority system,  of the distribution ofmaterials, the supply of which is inadequate to meet alldemands.2. Control still exists for a number of materials,e.g. steel, timber, lead,  jute, cotton yarn and paper, andhas been supplemented, since last winter, by a priorityestablished under a directive by the Prime Minister in favourof projects designed to improve the supply and distributionof fuel and power.3. Since that priority which is commonly referred toas P.M.L. - Prime Minister&apos;s List - was established, ourcircumstances, favoured by the mild autumn, hove improved.Coal production is better,  the staggering of hours to reducepeak loads has been successfully arranged over a wide field,and stocks of fuel at Power Stations, Gas Works and with industry ore very satisfactory;    though the worst of thewinter has still to come we con reasonably be optimisticabout the fuel and power situation.     Conversion of coal burningplant to oil has gone far enough to take up their availableoil    supply.   &apos; Firm programmes for the building of new and extended power stations have been set and started.      Thanks tothe excellent response of all concerned,  and particularly ofthe railway workers,- to the appeal for improved railwaywagon turn-round, to the assistance given by road and sea transport in the transport of coal,  and to the improvementin the&apos; rate of wagon repair, we have hitherto avoided anyserious transport crisis.1. Concurrently the need for expanding our exports and establishing and increasing our dollar saving assets such asships and reducing imports by such means as increasedagricultural production have created new and pressing demands upon us.      It is still necessary to continue the expansionof fuel and power resources and to maintain and improve ourtransport facilities but it is now equally necessary toincrease our exports and reduce our imports by all the meansavailable to us.5* The sum total of all these urgent needs representsin many fields, for example, the manufacture of iron andsteel and the engineering industry generally,  a very high proportion of our total notional effort.    The addition ofthese large scale new demands to the existing Prime Minister&apos;sList would create 0 priority class which in some directionswould for outweigh the remaining non-priority class.      Allexperience shows that a priority label which is attached to more than 0 limited proportion of any particular field failsin its objective.6. If the relative importance of the various demandsis taken into account in determining the allocations of essential materials,  and if the distribution arrangementsensure that deliveries match allocations there is no longer any need to assign priority to particular programmes.       Priority
should &quot;be needed only in cases where,  owing to a shortfall in the level of supplies,  the emergence of on unexpecteddemand or a breok.-d.own in the machinery of allocation anddistribution, a programme of national importance isimperilled.7. The-Paymaster-General announced in the House ofCommons on 20th November the changes proposed in the priority arrangements for steel.      In future the programmesincluded in the original Prime Minister&apos;s List will nolonger enjoy an automatic bulk priority for all their suppliesof steel.      In allocating the available steel suppliesconsideration has been given to the relative importance ofthe products to be manufacture! therefrom.      We are revising the steel distribution scheme so as to eliminate the largebacklog of orders and tj ensure that in future there is noover-authorisation.      Fran now on the grant of priority willbe limited, to specific cases where departments responsiblefor the requirements of fuel expansion and distribution,manufacture for export,  ship building,  and manufacture suchas agricultural machinery designed to save imports,  aresatisfied that the application of a priority status to a given order for steel of a stated type is necessary tosecure quicker delivery and to avoid, a hold-up in someessential production work.      There will be a limit set enthe tonnages of steel to which departments concerned canapply priority status on these lines and the items in the priority list will be varied as circumstances require.      in short, we are working from a position of automatic bulkpriority to one of limited and specific assistance to overcome individual bottle necks.      All claims to which the priority label is attached will rank equally.      A specificauthorisation to a particular consumer relating to a specified, quantity of steel of stated type will be issued.These authorisations will be given against the background of the main needs of today, which are to expand production for export, to ensure that exporting firms are supplied with components and to enable basic industries,  such ascoal,  steel and agriculture,  t j achieve their targets.8. The allocation and distribution of iron castingsis operated in the same way as for steel and a similarlimited P.M.L.  priority procedure will apply.9. The P.M.L.  symbol has been used to expeditesupplies of other materials and components for the fuelexpansion programme.      This procedure should now be regarded,as ended.10. In future, for allocated materials other thansteel and iron castings no formal priority procedure isproposed.      In the case of some materials,  such as timber,there are stocks from which distribution is made and thedifficulties in the ordering and delivery of fabricatedmaterial,  such as steel,  do not arise to the same extent.In the case of ether materials,  little difficulty has beenfound in ensuring that deliveries match the allocations andthere is no need to impose any additional priority procedureon the present system of allocation.      There are manymanufactured components,  such as ball bearings,  electricmotors, transformers and switehgear, which are in short supply and which contribute&apos; directly and indirectly to a wide range of production processes.      Any attempt, to allocate-h-
these items or to issue priority authorisations would involvelithe creation of a large staff and the&apos;institution of detailedenquiries over a wide field of industry, both of which theGovernment is anxious to avoid.      It is not,  therefore,;ipreposed to introduce allocation or priority systems forsuch items.1,1/. But cases ore bound, to arise in which difficulties will be experienced in obtaining delivery of materials oriicomponents essential to the manufacture of products whichin themselves are of prime importance.      In such casesP.M.L.  symbols will not be given but the manufacturer&quot;jconcerned, when he has done all that he himself can do-[should seek the assistance of the appropriate regional officeijof the Government Deportment which sponsors his activities;[that office will endeavour, with the co-operation of other[Government agencies concerned, to secure supplies of the type required.12. It will be seen from-what I have said that in future the P.M.L.  priority label will only apply to a limitedproportion of the iron and steel needed for production ofthe type I hove indicated and will be authorised by a specificletter issued by a Government department and applying to a[stated quantity and type of material concerned.      It will notapply,  and. will not be issued at all, to other materials or[to components.
