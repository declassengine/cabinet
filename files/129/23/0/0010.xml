DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTYOF   HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1948SECRET Copy No.&apos;] 1CP. (48) 107th January, 1948CABINETFATS ration memorandum by the Minister of food. The fats ration (butter, margarine and cooking fats) was introduced inJuly 1940 and was maintained at 8 oz. per week until mid-November 1941, whenit was increased to 10 oz. It remained at that level until January 1942. It wasthen reduced to 8 oz. where it remained for about 3^ years until the end ofMay 1945. It was then further reduced to 7 oz. until the autumn of 1945 whenit was increased to 8 oz. until March 1946. It then reverted again to 7 oz. whereit has since remained. The two reductions to 7 oz. were forced upon us by thesupply position and were only for this reason reluctantly accepted by our nutri-tional and medical advisers.2. The proportions of butter, margarine and cooking fats in the combinedfats ration have been changed from time to time. Owing to the breakdown ofthe Danish negotiations last autumn I had to reduce the butter ration from oz. to 2 oz. per week with effect from 9th November, but was able to maintainthe overall ration at 7 oz. by increasing the margarine ration from 3 oz. to 4 ozper week.3. Supplies of butter from the Southern Dominions are now coming forward in substantial quantities and will be at their maximum during the opening monthsof 1948. I have, therefore, restored the butter ration to 3 oz. per week with effect from 4th January and made a corresponding reduction in the margarineration from the same date to enable factory stocks to be built up. The overallfats ration will thus remain unchanged.4. Our general standard of rations has recently been increasinglycriticised largely because of the introduction of potato rationing and the cutswhich had to be made in consequence of the balance of payments position. Ourlatest critic is Sir Jack Drummond (Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Foodthroughout the war), who has drawn attention to our low calorie intake as theresult of these changes.5. It is true that I have been able to restore the bacon ration to the lowfigure of 2 oz. per week with effect from 11th January. This has been possibleas the result of the temporary arrangement with Canada. Supplies from Canada,notwithstanding the temporary arrangement, will fall considerably short of thesupplies we have obtained from that country in the past and the maintenance ofthe 2 oz. ration will be precarious.6. The potato supply position is very unsatisfactory, and I shall shortlyhave to propose a reduction in the &quot; ration.&quot; The allowance is at present 3 lb.per week. It will have to be reduced to 2 lb. per week, and possibly (for a limited period) to \\ lb. per week. I shall submit my proposals to my colleagues shortly after I have received the results of the potato census held on 1st January. Thiswill be available about 20th January.7. In the meantime I have been considering whether any increases couldbe made in other rations to improve our calorie intake. An increase in the fatsration would be a valuable contribution in this field. It would be one of the mostpopular steps which could be taken over the whole range of rationed foods.34765
28. Relying upon the supplies of butter from the Southern Dominions 1shall continue the butter ration at 3 ozs. per week at least until 24th April.If a satisfactory arrangement is reached in the forthcoming negotiations with denmark and I obtain the 42,500 tons of butter I hope to obtain from thatcountry in the first nine months of the year I shall be able to maintain the3 oz. butter ration throughout the whole of 1948.9. The vegetable oil position for 1948 is still uncertain. Supplies depend upon a number of factors of which the more doubtful are the outcome of thewhaling season; the result of the Argentine negotiations; an improvement inground-nut railings from Nigeria, in regard to which I am in communicationwith the Minister of Supply and the Secretary of State for the Colonies. Inall probability some of these things will go well and other badly.Our stocks of oils and fats are, however, nearly J70.000 tons up on this time last year (321,400 tons as against 252,900 tons). An increa.se in the ration of 1 oz. per week uses 84,000 tons in a year (or just over 20,000 tons for theperiod 1st February to 24th April). I am satisfied that I can, without unduerisk, restore the margarine ration from 3 oz. to 4 oz. per week from the1st February and continue this until 24th April. This would mean an overallfat ration of 8 oz. instead of the present 7 oz. during the most difficult periodof the year. The increase would go some way to compensate for the reductionwe shall have to face in the potato &quot; ration &quot; and the possibility of shortages infresh vegetables.10. If supplies of vegetable oils continue to be reasonably favourable andif I obtain the butter I hope to buy from Denmark as a result of the forth-coming negotiations, I shall be able to continue the increased fat ration of 8 oz.after 24th April. I must point out, however, that if I fail to procure the Danishbutter I shall have to revert to an overall fat ration of 7 oz. during the latespring and summer months.11. For the moment I do not wish to commit myself beyond 24th april and I ask for authority to increase the fats ration from 1st February to 24th April.If this is approved I shall announce that it is a temporary measure and thatthe ration after 24th April will be decided in due course in the light of thesupply position.J. S.Ministry of Food, S. W. 1,7th January, 1948.
