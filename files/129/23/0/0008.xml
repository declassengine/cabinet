[his document is the property of his britannic majesty*s goyernme&amp;the &amp;t 3 8Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1948&apos;0P secret copy No.  * -&apos; :JC.P. (48) 8ptk January, 1948CABINETFUTURE FOREIGN PUBLICITY policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in my paper on &quot; The First Aim of British Foreign Policy &quot; (OP. (48) 6) Ihave shown that the Russian and the Communist Allies are threatening the wholefabric of Western civilisation, and I have drawn attention to the need to mobilisespiritual forces, as well as material and political, for its defence. It is for us, asEuropeans and as a Social Democratic Government, and not the Americans, togive the lead in spiritual, moral and political sphere to all the democraticelements in Western Europe which are anti-Communist and, at the same time,genuinely progressive and reformist, believing in freedom, planning and socialjustice what one might call the &quot; Third Force.&quot; Equally in the Middle Eastand possibly in certain Far Eastern countries such as India, Burma, Ceylon,Malaya, Indonesia and Indo-China, Communism will make headway unless astrong spiritual and moral lead on the above lines is given against it, and we arein a good position to give such a lead. In many countries of Western Europe theforces of Social Democracy Will be the mainstay, but even in Western Europearid obviously in the Middle East and Far East our appeal could not be only to social Democratic Parties.Soviet propaganda has, since the end of the war, carried on in every spherea vicious attack against the British Commonwealth and against Westerndemocracy. Our publicity has hitherto been confined to supporting and explaining the current policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in foreign affairs and at home,to advocating our way of life, and publicising our social-democratic programme and achievements. Except in the Middle East, where we have allowed ourselvesmore latitude, our propaganda where Russia and Communism are concerned, hasbeen non-prOvocative, and we have not attempted systematically to expose themyths of the Soviet paradise. Something far more positive is clearly now required. If we are to give a moral lead to the forces of anti-Communism inEurope and Asia, we must be prepared to pass over to the offensive and not leavethe initiative to the enemy, but make them defend themselves.recommendations. We should adopt a new line in our foreign publicity designed to oppose the inroads of Communism, by taking the offensive against it, basing ourselves on the standpoint of the position and vital ideas of British Social Democracy and western civilisation, and to give a lead to our friends abroad and help them inthe anti-Communist struggle.2. The only new machinery required would be a small Section in the ForeignOffice to collect information concerning Communist policy, tactics and propaganda and to provide material for our anti-Communist publicity through our missions and Information Services abroad. The fullest co-operation of the B.B.C.Overseas Services would be desirable; but this and the provision of the necessary material by the Central Office of Information would be arranged through the usual channels.34752&apos;
2Our anti-Communist publicity material should also be available to ministers for use, when convenient, in their public speeches; and also to British delegations to conferences and-on an informal basis-to Labour Party and Trades Uniondelegations.3. We should develop visits by important Trade Unionists from abroad andother influential, non-Communist foreigners, and set up a &quot;Wilton Park&quot; inwhich we could offer them courses on British life and institutions, and make available to them material and ideas useful for the struggle in their own countriesagainst Communism. In short, we should seek to make London the Mecca for social democrats in Europe.ConsiderationsSoviet propaganda has, since the end of the war, been directly hostile to thiscountry, and for many months past has reverted to its old pre-war line of directantagonism to Social Democracy. As my colleagues are aware, the Prime Ministerand I, and other members of the Government, are often directly attacked. the propaganda of the Soviet satellites now, of course, follows exactly the same line,and is apparently to be co-ordinated by the Cominform. We can no longer submitpassively to the Communist offensive; we must attack and expose Communism andoffer something far better. What we have to offer in contrast to totalitarianCommunism and laissez-faire capitalism,&apos; are the vital and progressive ideas ofBritish Social Democracy and Western European civilisation., I suggest that the&apos; following are the principles which should guide ourpublicity (a) We should advertise our principles as offering the best and most efficientway of life. We.should attack, by comparison, the principles and practice of Communism, and also the inefficiency, social injustice and moral weakness of unrestrained capitalism. We must not, however,attack or appear to be attacking any member of the Commonwealthor the United States.(6) Our main target should be the broad masses of workers and peasants inEurope and the Middle East. We should, therefore, use the argumentsmost likely to appeal to them. First amongst these is the argument that, compared with Social Democratic countries, such as Britain,Sweden and New Zealand, the standard of life (wages, food, housing,&amp;c.) for the ordinary people is extremely low in the Soviet Union,where &quot;privilege for the few &quot; is a growing phenomenon. Russia&apos;spretence to be a &quot; Workers&apos; Paradise &quot; is a gigantic hoax. We canfairly ask why the Communists, if life under Communist rule is soenviable, should shut themselves off so completely. Social Democracy,on the other hand, gives higher living standards for the masses andprotects them against privilege and. exploitation, whether Capitalistor Communist.(c) Equally important is that we should stress the civil liberties issue,pointing to the many analogies between Hitlerite and Communistsystems. We cannot hope successfully to repel Communism only bydisparaging it on material grounds, and must add a positive appealto Democratic and Christian principles, remembering the strength ofChristian sentiment in Europe. We must put forward a positive rivalideology. We must stand on the broad principles of Social Democracy,which, in fact, has its basis in the value of civil liberty and human rights. Examples should be given in order to show what the loss ofcivil liberties and human rights means in practice. This is speciallynecessary in countries where the loss of these rights and liberties has never been experienced and therefore is not appreciated.(d) We should represent Communism and the foreign policy of communist countries as a hindrance to international co-operation and world peace.We should expose the immorality, militancy and destructiveness of communist foreign policy, and diplomatic methods, their manoeuvresto divide and impoverish Western European countries and to exploittheir control of Europe&apos;s main food-producing areas. We shouldrepresent the satellite countries as &quot; Russia&apos;s new colonial empire,&quot;serving Russia&apos;s strategic and economic interests at the cost of thefreedom and living standards of the Eastern European peoples Themyth that the Russians never break treaties should be exposed andCommunism portrayed as the stalking-horse of Russian imperialism
(e) Finally we should disseminate clear and cogent answers to Russianmisrepresentations about Britain. &quot;We should not make the mistakeof allowing ourselves to be drawn into concentrating our whole energyin dealing with those subjects which are selected for debate by RussianIpropaganda. On the other hand we must see to it that our friends inEurope and elsewhere are armed with the facts and the answers to russian propaganda. If we do not provide this ammunition, theywill not get it from any other source.In general we should emphasise the weakness of Communism rather than[its strength. Contemporary American propaganda, which stresses the strength[and aggressiveness of Communism, tends to scare and unbalance the anfci-ICommunists, while heartening the fellow-travellers and encouraging the communists to bluff more extravagantly. Our propaganda, by dwelling onjussian&apos;s poverty and backwardness, could be expected to relax rather than toraise the international tension.We must not, of course, exaggerate the effects which can be produced bypublicity alone. But I am convinced that in the interests of this country, theBritish Commonwealth and of our friends abroad, we must now take this moredefinitely anti-Communist line in our publicity. I ask for the active support andco-operation of my colleagues.E. B.Foreign Office, S. W. 1,4:th January, 1948.
