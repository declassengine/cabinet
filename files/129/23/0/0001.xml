(47) 332).R. S. treasury Chambers, S.W- 1,1st January, 1948.FORTNIGHTLY ECONOMIC report . Man-power the Ministry of Labour figures for October are now available. They showthat the numbers in civil employment in Great Britain rose by a further 95,000during the month. Employment in the manufacturing iliduSti ICS increased by75,000 or 1 per cent, during the month.2. The improvement during October was mainly due to a larger number of full-time workers taking up employment for the first time, and to an increaseof part-time women and foreign workers. Of the total increase of 95,000 duringthe month, 50,000 were women and 10,000 foreign workers.3. Employment in textiles showed a welcome gain of 12,000 workers inOctober but the total employed in the textile industries is still one-fifth lessthan before the war.4. The number of workers on colliery books increased from 714,000 at theend of November to 719,000 by the third week in December. This was the resultof an increase in the number entering the industry and a substantial fall in thenumber leaving. The original target of 730,000 workers for the coal industry at the end of 1947 has not been reached.II. ProductionCoal5. The improvement in coal production continues. The output of deep-mined coal has been maintained at over 4 million tons a week and total outputof deep-mined and opencast coal rose to 4-40 million tons in the week ended34730 b
20th December. During the Christmas holiday week total production fell to2-75 million tons which was 364,000 tons greater than in the same week of1946. To achieve the target of 200 million tons for 1947 (53 weeks) it will benecessary to produce 3-42 million tons in the last week of the year.6. Output per man shift has been rising steadily since 1945 and is now almostback to the 1938 level. The number of shifts worked per man is also approaching the 1938 level although below the peak figures achieved in the war years 1940to 1942. On the other hand, the number of men on colliery books is about 60,000less than in 1938.7. More men are needed in the mines if coal output is to increase further in 1948. Part of the increase in production in recent weeks has been due to the extra hours miners are now working. Even if productivity continues to rise, itis uncertain what effect the reversion to a 5-day week will have on output.Textiles -..8. The output of cotton yarn rose again in November to a weekly averageof 14-80 million lbs. At the end of the month it exceeded 15 million lbs. a week for the first time since the war, but this rate of output is still less than three-quarters of what it was before the war.9. The latest figures available for wool fabrics those for October showthat production of woven goods is increasing.Engineering10. Production of motor vehicles declined in November from the recordlevel achieved in October, mainly because of Austin&apos;s change over to a new model.11. Although output of coal cutters was maintained in November, deliveries to the National Coal Board were reduced from 83 to 68. Production for homeuse of colliery tubs and mining cars decUned in November, but the outputof conveyors was higher.Iron and Steel12. The high rate of production of steel ingots and castings achieved inOctober and November was maintained in the first two weeks of December. Thisoutput has, however, been achieved only by reducing stocks of both pig-iron, anscrap to very low levels. Even so, current output of steel has not been sufficiento meet deliveries of finished steel, and in consequence stocks of steelJhave also beendeclining. Supplies of pig-iron or scrap must be increased if we are to achieve the higher level of steel production On which many of the 1948 programmesdepend.IIL-Food13. Revised estimates by the Ministry of Food of stocks of food at the endof January and February will be prepared next week. Forecasts of the stock of potatoes are likely to snow a position somewhat worse than had been expected.14. On the other hand, the supply position of wheat and flour shows slightimprovement, but stocks of wheat on farms at the end of February are expectedto be 164,000 tons lower than a year ago.IV.-TransportRailways15. The total stock of railway wagons has not increased, but the numberavailable for use rose from 1,025,000 at the beginning of November to 1,048,000at 5th December, owing to a reduction in the number under or awaiting&apos; repair.The estimated average turn-round time of wagons rose from 9 1 days in the second week of November to 9-7 days in the first week of December, but fell again to-4 days in the following week.16. Although the operating stock of locomotives continues to increase, morelocomotives are under repair or not available, and the number available for use isbeing maintained at 16,000.
Y. External TradeExports17. In spite of the steady increase during the year in the numbers engaged on direct exports the Ministry of Labour figures show a further increase of119,000 in October there is still little evidence of a corresponding rise in thevolume of exports. Exports in November were 12 per cent, higher than theaverage of 1938. It now seems unlikely that the volume index for the last quarterof 1947 will show much, if any, improvement over that for the last quarter of1946. The increase in the value of exports over the year is due largely to therise in export prices.Imports-18. The value of imports (c.i.f.) declined sharply in November by  23million or 15 per cent, compared, with October.YI. Balance of Payments19. The latest figures show that while the drain on our reserves of gold and dollars continues at a serious rate, the drain is less than it was. There is still,however, a long way to go before the rate is reduced to the target figure of anaverage of  25 million a month in 1948.20. Sales of South African gold to this country have been maintained atthe higher level of  3 million a week since the middle of November. On the otherhand, there have been heavy outgoings of gold to Belgium and of dollars to Indiato meet India&apos;s dollar deficit.The Drain on Reserves1947AprilMayJuneJulyAugustSeptemberOctober ..  million77-583-481 0133-5155-492-8067-1058-90(!) Including drawings from the International Monetary Fund which amounted to  14 9 million in September,  29-8 million in October and  14*9 million in November.21. The result of bilateral negotiations to date has been to intensify the dollar problem in 1948. In many of our major negotiations the dollar allocationhas had to be increased above the figure originally expected. Examples areGermany, Canada, Egypt and Iraq. A revised paper on the dollar outlook for1948 is under preparation.YII. ConsumptionTobacco22. One of the ways in which our balance of payments difficulties are beingmet is by running down stocks in this country. Purchases of tobacCo from theUnited States have been stopped. Our tobacco stocks, which amounted to393 million lbs. at the end of April 1947, fell to 374 million lbs. at the end ofOctober 1947 and may be expected to fall further as existing contracts are completed.23. Consumption of tobacco fell by almost one-third immediately after the april Budget but recovered to about 84 per cent, of the rate of consumption atthe end of 1946. As a result of a cut in manufacturers&apos; supplies to retailersconsumption began to fall in September and is now estimated to be about 80 nercent, of the end-1946 level. r

The index number of export prices (1938 = 100) rose from 237 in october to 240 in November, while import prices increased from 256 to 259. Americanwheat prices have risen above $3 a bushel and wholesale prices of American farm products rose 5 per cent, between the middle of October and the middle ofDecember. An immediate change of the terms of trade in our favour seems unlikely.Cost of Living25. The Ministry of Labour interim index of retail prices shows a rise from 101 at 14th October (17th June 1947, 100) to 103 at 18th November.The rise was in all groups except rent and rates.Wage Rates26. Increases in wage rates in the mining, building and civil engineering industries during November have raised the index of weekly wage rates from 170to 173 (September 1939 = 100) the largest rise in any month since January 1946.
