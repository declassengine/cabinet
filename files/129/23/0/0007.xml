(48) 7\th January, 1948CABINETREVIEW OF SOVIET policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsIntroductionTHE breakdown of the Council of Foreign Ministers and other recent eventseem to point to the increasing difficulty ot reaching any agreement with theJ.S.S.R. on political topics. It therefore seems worth while to review thesituation generally and to see what conclusions can be drawn about Soviet policy.conclusions. From the following review of Soviet and Communist activities in recentaonths, certain deductions may be drawn regarding Soviet policy: (a) The present policy of the Soviet Government is based on the assumptionthat the Marshall Plan will and must fail and that, as preached byMarx, the Capitalist Powers will quarrel among themselves and their power will disintegrate as a result of slumps and depressions. Ifthese assumptions are proved by events to be untrue the SovietGovernment, might radically change its policy, but not till then. as things are at present they have, proclaimed their idea of two worlds in conflict and are opposed to reconstruction in the West on the onlyterms on which it seems to be practicable.(6) The Soviet Government have ruthlessly consolidated their position within their orbit and in Eastern Europe. They have made a mockery oftheir many pledges about free elections. &amp;c, in the Yalta and PotsdamAgreements. Throughout Eastern Europe, the same pattern of a soviet- and Communist-dominated political and economic structureis becoming increasingly obvious. Even Czechoslovakia is nowthreatened. All opposition organisations within the Soviet orbit havebeen or are being liquidated. Contact with foreigners is everywherebeing reduced to a minimum. Western, and particularly British and american, interests and influence are everywhere being eliminated.The former satellites of Germany are, in fact, now the satellites of theSoviet Union. Even in our trade relations with the Soviet union and Eastern Europe we must remember that such trade will always be subject to Soviet and Communist political requirements and there-fore liable to sudden interruptions. It may even be used as a meansof bringing political pressure to bear against us.(c) Soviet accusations against us at the Council of Foreign Ministers asto our action in Germany seem designed to cover up what they are themselves doing in their zone, while trying to saddle us with responsibility in the eyes of the German people for the partition ofGermany.34745
(d) They have given up hope of the Communist parties achieving power inErance and Italy by legal means. For the moment the Communists&apos;somewhat premature attempt at direct action in France has failed,though they have inflicted grave economic injury on the country.We must expect them to take some action in Italy, possibly a coup forwhich arms and specialists are believed to be held in readiness in yugoslavia, possibly a wave of continuing industrial unrest on sucha scale as to make Marshall aid or any attempt at reconstructionfruitless. We must expect a further attempt to get our troops outof Trieste, where they are an obvious impediment to Soviet policy.(e) As the Soviet Government have decided to do their best to prevent thesuccess of the Marshall Plan in France and Italy, we must now expectthem to do the same in Western Germany. But so far as western germany is concerned the methods to be used and their timing are still not clear. This applies also to the policy which they are likely to pursue in Eastern Germany.(/) A further Communist effort seems to be imminent in Greece with theestablishment of the so-called Democratic Greek Government and anattempt to detach large parts of Northern Greece is foreshadowed.This would bring Russian influence down to the ^Eegan, and turkey would not long remain independent.(^) The undermining of British and American influence is the keystone of soviet policy in the Middle East, as elsewhere. By supportingpartition in Palestine the Soviets may well hope to encourage disorder in the Middle East. Their attitude would not prevent them later onfrom supporting the Arabs if it suited their general policy.(h) There are signs that the Soviets may shortly stir up trouble afresh in persia, particularly in Azerbaijan.(i) If the Soviets secured control of France and French North Africa, of Italy, 1and of Greece, and particularly if they could undermine our position Iin the Middle East, they would effectively dominate the Mediterranean Iand could (if they wished) deprive us of access to extensive markets and raw materials, especially oil, without which our economic recoverywould be difficult or impossible and the strategic position both ofourselves and of the United States gravely jeopardised.(;*) We must beware of the far-reaching effects of colonial propaganda even where it is disguised as support for nationalist aspirations.(k) It seems that we must expect the U.S.S.R. to pursue their forward policyin Sinkiang, Manchuria and Korea. There is a distinct danger thatthe Communists may succeed in dominating the whole of China, whichwould present a considerable threat to the territories of South-east asia.(I) If the U.S.S.R. could gain control of China, France and a few othercountries for international purposes, it would shift, politically,economically and strategically, the whole basis of power both in theUnited Nations and in the world at large.General Outline of Soviet policy. The first objective of Soviet policy is probably to advance and to hastentheir own reconstruction. At the same time they wish to overtake the materialprosperity of the West and to draw out of the post-war confusion in the worlda number of important advantages for themselves. I do not believe that the SovietGovernment would consciously wish to risk a war for this purpose, particularlywhile the secret of the atom bomb is a monopoly of the Anglo-Saxon Powers. Theyprobably consider that they can get what they want by &quot;cold war &quot; methods.In carrying these into effect they can rely, both in the Soviet orbit and beyond, onthe unquestioning obedience of the agents whom they have trained in Russia for years past, and whom they place in positions of authority wherever practicable(e.g., Marshal Tito, M. Modzelewski, M. Thorez).4. The Cominform Declaration published on 5th October proclaimed openlyto the world with the greatest publicity the doctrine that the world was dividedinto two opposing camps which were in conflict. It called on Communistseverywhere to close their ranks, not to underestimate their strength, and to intensify the struggle. It denounced the &quot;Truman-Marshall Plan&quot; as acomponent part of the general policy of the United States and Great Britain for
Strengthening imperialism and stifling democracy.&quot; It called upon theEuropean Communist parties to head the resistance to these plans, to rally andunite their efforts on the basis of a common programme, for which new co-ordi-nating machinery was established. M. Zhdanov in his speech to the CominformConference, which was also given the widest publicity, said that &quot; As for theII.S.S.R., it will make all efforts to see to it that the (Marshall) plan is not1 realised.&quot;Europehhe Soviet Orbit5. The situation in Eastern Europe has been rapidly- and ruthlessly consoli-I dated during the last year.I    I would recall briefly the commitments of the Soviet Government at Yalta,[and subsequently confirmed, in the case of Poland, at Potsdam, to ensure freeI elections and other aspects of democracy as we understand it.  The Soviet UnionI has made a complete mockery of these commitments in Roumariia, Bulgaria and[Poland. In Hungary, where relatively free elections have been held, other methods[have been adopted to ensure effective Communist domination.  In Yugoslavia the[process has gone furthest, although the most glaring example of the abuse ofI democratic liberties has been the murder of Petkov in Bulgaria, coupled with theI suspension of the Agrarian Party.   The most recent example of Soviet methods1 is the enforced abdication of King Michael in Roumania. Earlier results of Sovietj and Communist pressure politics were the flights of the former Hungarian PrimeMinister, M. Nagy, from Hungary, and of the Peasant Party leader, M. Miko-lajczyk, from Poland.   We now have information suggesting that an effort willbe made in the next few months to ensure Communist domination in Czecho-slovakia.  Everywhere in Eastern Europe the development has been similar.   It[ is only the pace that has differed.The pattern of Communist policy in the Soviet orbit of Eastern Europe isnow plainly visible, and the Governments of the various States in the area nolonger apply purely national policies but have become the administrative agents of the Communist Party both internally and in international affairs. The growingnetwork of bi-lateral agreements, political and strategic, commercial and cultural,binds the whole area together, and to the Soviet Union, in a bloc of Communist-administered territory where human rights and freedoms no longer exist and localneeds are subordinated to the policy requirements of the Cominform and theKremlin. The degree of elimination of Opposition Parties and Leaders variesfrom country to country, but only in Czechoslovakia can it be said that an effective and active opposition to the Communists (apart from the Roman catholic church) still exists. There has been talk of schemes of federation or confederation-tion within the area, e.g., a South Slav federation (Yugoslavia and Bulgaria) andpossibly a Danubian Confederation.An economic pattern of Communist control is already visible. On theeconomic side, Communist control of industry and even of agricultural production has been growing ever stronger and is as real as, although less obvious than,Communist political control. Western (and particularly British and American)enterprises and interests are under direct attack; in the ex-enemy countrieseconomic control of banks, industries and communications has already been to agreat degree established by means of Soviet companies who have taken over and added to the German assets allotted to them under the Potsdam Agreement.While we should clearly do everything in our power to develop trade with theSoviet Union and Eastern Europe, we should always remember that such trade will be subject to Soviet and Communist political requirements dictated from moscow. It will be sporadic and liable to sudden interruptions. It may even be used as a means of bringing political pressure to bear on us at a suitablepsychological moment.6.   In brief, the whole area is in process of transformation into an economicautarchy and ideological bloc largely organised and controlled by Moscow-trainedCommunists.  In the Soviet orbit and Eastern Germany Russia effectively controls the main food-producing areas of Europe.   Experience shows that generally[speaking the products of those areas can only be purchased after prolonged inter-^gUVCI xlxXXOJlx VOlL     llUgVtKLLUJJ.!,     ailU      LllttL&apos;      iV V     IAIX V     J.V1 *JUU     XXX     X \-V*-*JL XX      IJU     OlA^/pij %/*ML&quot;goods which by building up the puppet Governments strengthen Soviet domina-tion.   The situation is particularly serious in Western Germany and Austria,34745 b 2
which have long been accustomed to get the bulk of their food from eastern europe, but it affects the whole of Western Europe in varying degrees.Germany7. The pattern of Soviet political policy in Germany is fundamentallysimilar to their policy in Hungary and the other satellite countries. Behind afacade of political freedom and democratic government, they have aimedconstantly at gaining complete practical control of the political scene by estab-lishing a Police State similar to the Germany of the Gestapo.8. Their first method has been to penetrate and dominate all the political parties. After allowing the four main parties to form in Berlin and the SovietZone on terms corresponding to those in the Western Zones, they have alreadygone a long way towards reducing all but their own favoured Socialist UnityParty to impotence. The Social Democrats and the small Liberal DemocraticParty have been dealt with and the remaining party, the Christian Democrats,are now under heavy fire. The Russians very soon removed the original leader,Hermes, but his successor, Kaiser, has proved a courageous and successfulopponent. The Russians have for months passed tried to break the spirit of thisparty, both by direct pressure and threats against Kaiser and by local actionagainst the lower levels of the party. Minor leaders have been arrested and grossdiscrimination has been exercised against the party newspapers, members havebeen forced to attend Communist-inspired meetings against their wishes and their part&apos;s orders, and they have been directly threatened by the local Soviet authori-ties on numerous occasions. In spite of this, the party has maintained its solidsupport of Kaiser, even in the face of direct Soviet action to oust him from theparty leadership, as a result of its refusal as a party to participate in the recent&quot; People&apos;s Congress&quot; to represent a &quot;German&quot; view to the Council,of foreign ministers. The crisis is still at its height, with the outcome still in doubt, but whatever happens the case of Kaiser will remain a good example of how the soviet authorities &quot; encourage &quot; political freedom.9. The second Soviet method has been to distort public opinion as expressedin the elected Assemblies. Their election tactics are designed to ensure th(most favourable results for the Communists. In spite of this the non-Communistparties gained a very considerable proportion of the seats in the LandParliaments. Nevertheless the vast majority of the key political posts itthe Soviet Zone are held by Communists. Moreover, the political balance hasbeen swung in favour of the Communists by the introduction into thfmachinery of government of non-political organisations such as the Trade Unions,Farmers&apos; blocs, &amp;c, all under Communist control. A procedure has been setup whereby these organisations sit with the political parties on so-called AntiFascist Bloc Committees, through which all important measures have to passbefore they are put before the Assemblies. In these Committees &quot; unanimous &quot;decisions are forced by the direct pressure Of the Communist majorities, and inthis way the influence of the non-Communist parties is virtually eliminated.10.   Russian propaganda directed against the British administration itWestern Germany is roughly a variation on two themes.   The first is that theBritish are reviving fascism and militarism, and the second that they anexploiting the resources of German industry.  These themes, which are repeatetdespite the most authoritative explanations and denials, were taken up witlrenewed emphasis by M. Molotoy at the Council of Foreign Ministers as th(basis of his campaign against the Marshall Plan; according to him, we wish.Uenslave the German people and to set up an imperialist base in Central Europe!The Russians alleged that the former Nazi bosses of the steel and coal monopolielin the Ruhr have been reinstated bv the British.   They have insisted that thlGerman &quot; Dienstgruppen &quot; employed in minelifting, &amp;c., are camouflaged arm!units destined as the future &quot; Black Reichswehr &quot; for the Western zones.11. On the economic side the accusations are even more numerous and varied!Enormous profits are said to be made over the sale of Ruhr coal. The Britislarid United States zones are flooded with imports, many of them unnecessary!in order to enslave Western Germany by debt. Hood rations are artificially lowerefto maintain a market for British and United States goods. Future Germaicompetition is eliminated by the dismantling of neace-time ind ustries whi!^armament factories are left intact to produce for the British. Untold sums havibeen taken in &quot;hidden reparations&quot; such as German patents, German gold!merchant shipping, &amp;c, in spite of the fact that Russia shared equally witlthe rest of the Allies in regard to all these things.
12. The Russians know these accusations to be false. It has now becomequite clear that they are accusing the British of exactly those things which they themselves are doing in their own zones. It is known, for instance, that largenumbers of Nazis have been allowed to work their passage home by joining theGerman Communist Party and that high-ranking Nazis such as Field-Marshalvon Paulus (wanted by Belgium for war crimes) are in the employ of the Russians.The accusations about &quot; Dienstgruppen &quot; are designed to conceal the fact that members of the former German army are employed on instructional and technicalduties in the Red Army, and that large numbers of German ex-officers and menwho have gone through an extensive course of political indoctrination, and are held in readiness to return to Germany to take over posts in the police and other government services; many such men have already been sent back to Germany.13. As for the accusations about coal profits from the Ruhr and the dismantling of peace-time industries, &amp;c, they are nothing but a smokescreen todistract attention from the acquisition for valueless Reichsmarks of Germanconcerns by the Soviet State and the removal of over 7 billion dollars&apos; worth of reparations. The whole campaign against the Marshall Plan and &quot; economic-enslavement &quot; serves to conceal the fact that the Russians, by their ruthlessexploitation of German industry and labour, have reduced Eastern Germanyto a state of complete dependence&quot;on the Russian economic system and have pavedthe way for its economic integration into the Eastern bloc.14. There are some Russian malpractices, however, of which the russians have not the face to accuse the Western Allies. Such malpractices include themaintenance of the former Nazi concentration camps such as Sachsenhausenand Buchenwald, whose inmates consist mainly of the political opponents of soviet Russia. Through such camps there passes a flow of German civilians(Over 250,000 up to date) who are sent to labour camps in Russia and of releasedprisoners of war returning to Germany from the West (estimated at 275,000 upto date); these men are immediately arrested for political reasons and trainloads, of prisoners, still wearing the British battledress issued to them in this country,have been seen on the way to labour camps in the East.15. Nowhere has the fundamental incompatibility between Soviet and united Kingdom policy been shown more clearly than at the recent meetings ofthe Council of Foreign Ministers. At those meetings the utmost has been done to present our views on the treatment of Germany in all their reasonableness,and to convince the Soviet Foreign Minister of the sincerity of our desire toreach agreement with him. But on every point we have been met with intran-sigence, and with unwarranted accusations and insults. This applies to our desire for German political unity on a peaceful and democratic basis, and forthe economic unity and viability of Germany which is essential to Europeanprosperity, to our plan for the objective study of all the frontier problems andto other questions discussed.A ustria16. Soviet policy towards Austria since the end of the Moscow Conferenceof the Council of Foreign Ministers has largely been manifested in the obstructivetactics adopted in the Austrian Treaty negotiations. When the london conference opened, it became evident that M. Molotov was not prepared to makeany concession over Austria until the other Delegations had revealed their intentions in regard to Germany. Thus, the compromise proposal which theFrench Delegation had put forward for settling the question of German assetson a basis of figures was rejected by the Soviet Delegation, in substance if notin principle, and it was only at the very end of the Conference that M. Molotovresponded to our initiative to keep the Austrian discussions going, by at lastindicating a figure for Soviet claims in respect of the Austrian oil industry. this action, however, and the subsequent attitude of the Soviet Deputy, demonstrated that the U.S-S.R. were anxious to avoid a breakdown of the Austrian Treaty! negotiations and the Deputies are to re-convene shortly, when the Soviet Govern-ment have promised to table further proposals, within the framework already agreed by the other Delegations. A basis has at last been secured on which itshould be possible to make progress provided the will to do so exists on theSoviet side. -&apos; &apos; &apos;ri   17.   As to general political relations in: the period under review, soviet policy towards Austria has shown no marked change of intensity or direction.
Although Soviet interference has been characterised mainly by the threat of action Irather than by action itself, individual Austrians continue to disappear. In themiddle of October three police chiefs in the Soviet Zone were removed on trumped-up charges (this may have been the Soviet reply to the Austrian initiative indismissing the Communist head of the State Police); and at the beginning ofDecember Soviet controls were reimposed on the passage of goods across the zonalfrontier. The Administration of Soviet Property in Austria (U.S.I.V.A.) has paid no attention to Austrian price controls and regulations. The CommunistParty, owing perhaps to its relative insignificance, has not proved a very effectiveinstrument of Soviet policy in Austria, but there has been some evidence of an organised campaign of strikes during December Perhaps from lack of Sovietencouragement and as a result of the poor Communist showing in the works&apos;council elections this seems to have petered out in a few strikes and a few localattempts at forcible land &quot; reform &quot; in the Eastern Zone. Finally, in the course Iof quadripartite business, the Soviet Element has in general continued to obstructAustrian and Western proposals. The only Soviet concession has been over the Ipassage, in the middle of December, of the Currency Conversion Law, after theSoviet Element had delayed it for some ten days, made a good bargain for theirown currency in Austria and dissociated themselves from any responsibility forthe success of the law.The Cominform Policy in Western and Southern Europe18. We know that at a secret Communist meeting held at the end of September,M. Zhdanov made a speech admitting the decline of communism in France andItaly, emphasising that the Communists in those countries could not hope to attainpower by constitutional means, and making it clear that a decision had beenreached that the only possible action was a seizure of power by force. In order tocarry out this policy, strike action should be increased to the maximum possible extent, and if the opponents of communism resorted to force, the Communiststhemselves would be provided with all the finance and arms that would be required.War materials for this purpose would, it was stated, be concentrated in Ljubljanain Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav Communist Party would provide unconditionalassistance and possible armed intervention. Preparations were to be ready intwo months (i.e., at the beginning of December). It is against this almost certainknowledge of Communist plans that the situation in France and Italy must be reviewed.France19. The statement made bv M. Maurice Thorez, secretary-general of theFrench Communist Party, to the &quot;Central Committee of the party on 29th October,after the Cominform declaration, marked a complete reversal of the PopularFront policy pursued by the party for the past ten years.20. Immediately the Socialists and all other non-Stalinists were denouncedas saboteurs of working-class unity; M. Duclos and the Communists in theAssembly suddenly resorted to the &quot;violent abuse and filibustering tactics; and finally, the disturbances in Marseilles on 12th November led to the great waveof industrial disputes which&apos;has just swept France. M. Thorez and M. Casanove(a leader of the militant wing of the French Communists) were in Moscow when matters came to a head, and it seems clear from the preceding paragraph thatthe outbreak of strikes was prematurely timed For the moment, this outburst of Gallic impatience has damaged the Communist position in France. When theFrench worker realised that the Communist leaders were not working to get himhis rights, but were exploiting his very genuine grievances for the sake of political warfare, he went back to work and decided to stick it out under a moderateGovernment. This also explains the extension of the &quot;force ouvriere &quot; movement and its secession from the C.G.T.21. After the heavy defeat they have suffered, it will be difficult for the communists to incite further general disputes in France for some time with any real chances of success, though as part of a general plan they may, in the coming months, have to make a further attempt by this or other means to paralyse and ifpossible overthrow the present regime in France., But as they have alreadyalienated the great majority of the French population by their violence, it isprobable that they will now need some time to regroup their forces and endeavourto recover their position.. Meanwhile though immense losses have been caused to!...f
the French economy, the French Government and people have at least shown a readiness and capacity to meet this threat to their existence and standard ofliving. , , ...Italy22. The Communists, with the Nenni Socialists who support their action at every stage, have solid backing from the workers in the North and have probablynow reached the maximum of their strength there. In the South their strengthmay still grow on the fertile ground of poverty and economic distress. They have in the past infiltrated into the Italian police force and to a certain extent into thearmy and the administrative machine. Since the formation of Signor de Gasperfslast Government, however, strenuous efforts have been made to eradicate them andhave been meeting with considerable success. The Communists have control ofthe Trade Unions and the former Resistance Movement. They are welldisciplined and reasonably well armed.23. We know that, the Soviet Government^ policy towards Italy, ever since last June, has been one of cajoling and threatening the Italian Government togive up reliance upon American help and to make a political and militaryunderstanding with Russia which would be tantamount to entering the Sovietorbit.24.   It is reported that detailed plans have been drawn up by the Communistsfor the violent seizure of power.  The assault has not, however, begun.25.   The recent strikes in Italy and in particular those at Rome and Milanare unlikely to have been more than demonstrations.   The strike in Rome, which met with firm opposition from the Government, was called oft&apos; promptly, and hashad the immediate effect of raising the prestige of the Italian Prime Minister and minister of the Interior.   But it may all along have been intended as a feint tolull the world and more particularly the Italian Government into a false sense of security while something much more serious is being prepared in the industrialNorth, where Togliatti will also be in closer touch with the Yugoslavs.   Thereis known to be dissension among the Communist leaders in Italy about the likelihood of success of any such &quot; Putsch.&quot;   Although the Italian governments have remained outwardly calm and reasonably confident that they could resist aI&quot; Putsch,&quot; provided that it did not have too great support from outside Italy,1 there is no doubt that they are fully aware of the danger.28. It may be observed in this connexion that any serious Communistj attempt at the seizure of power is likely to take place in Italy before it isI attempted in France in view of the necessity for contact with a thoroughlyI Communist-controlled country (i.e., Yugoslavia), from which clandestine but1 extensive assistance could be given (as in Greece). If the seizure of power were to be successful in North Italy there would then be available a line of communica-tion between the Communist Eastern bloc and South-East France where the communists are making special preparations.Trieste27. The presence of 5,000 British and 5,000 American troops is an obviousI impediment to the development of Soviet policy in Italy, and our most recentI reports indicate increasing subversive pressure against Allied Military Govern-I ment.  This pressure is exerted in two ways : (a) by the internal activity of Communist-controlled unions and of the highlyorganised Slav minority groups; the latter recently staged a demonstration which was co-ordinated with an influx of individualdemonstrators from the Yugoslav Zone of the Free Territory;(b) by a general campaign (Yugoslav protests have even been communicatedgratuitously to the members of the Security Council) to impugn themethods and administration of Allied Military Government and to exert pressure for the early election of a weak Governor of theTerritory, so that, when the two zones are amalgamated, the totali-tarian police and administrative machine already functioning in theIYugoslav Zone can penetrate the whole Territory and assume adominating position once the Governor dispenses with the Anglo-American forces.
Greece28. Since the failure of the Communist attempt in 1944 to seize power in thecountry as a whole, the Communists have, with the aid of Slav elements in theNorth, concentrated on the following objectives : (a) to disrupt the administration and economic rehabilitation of the country by all means, including armed rebellion;(&amp;) to work towards the eventual detachment of at least Greek Macedoniaand Thrace from the control of the Athens Government.29. As regards (a), the evidence that the &apos;&apos; bandit&apos;&apos; campaign is inspired by international Communist sources and is part of the Communist plan forpenetration to the Mediterranean is beyond doubt; and the majority report ofthe first United Nations Balkans Commission made it clear that arms, &amp;c, aresupplied from over Greece&apos;s northern frontier and that the insurgent bands receiveasylum and training over the frontier. As a result of their raids over 400,000villagers have left their homes and constitute a most serious refugee problem;and some of Greece&apos;s most fertile areas are abandoned. There is every reasonto suppose that everything possible will be done to keep this campaign goingand intensify it; the recent declaration of the formation of a &quot; Democratic GreekGovernment&apos;&apos; is clear evidence of this intention.30. As regards the detachment of Greek Macedonia and Thrace, communist propaganda has long suggested the following aims : (i) One object of the formation of a &quot; Democratic Greek Government &quot; inthose areas in Northern Greece, where the rebels have de facto control,is to enable such a Government to be recognised by the Slav Powers,to receive more open assistance from them, and to extend that controlsouthwards. Hitherto a difficulty has been the establishment of a&quot; capital &quot; on Greek soil, but the town of Serres (which has notyet been captured) has been authoritatively mentioned as a possible&apos;&apos; capital&apos;&apos;; and Konitsa. another possible seat, has been under heavybandit attack.(ii) The detachment, as a result of more active armed intervention by the yugoslavs and Bulgarians, of the Salonica area (which would go tothe Yugoslav Federal Republic of Macedonia) and of Greek Thrace(which would be Bulgaria&apos;s share). This move would provide the communists with their long-desired iEgean outlets. Greek Macedoniamight be incorporated into an autonomous Macedonian Republic as one member of the wider Yugoslav-Bulgarian Federation to which therecent exchanges between Tito and Dimitrov have given publicity. if anything of this kind is brought to fruition, we shall be left with a&quot; rump &quot; Greece, the economic and military weakness of which must make Athens an obvious objective of further Communist expansionism,and further the encirclement and isolation of Turkey.Middle EastTurkey31. Russia has since 1945 been carrying on a nerve-war against turkey and, until firmly rebutted by Turkey with British and United States support,pressed a claim to a base or other means of control over the Straits. The large army which Turkey has felt compelled to maintain has imposed a great strain on her economy. But Turkish nerves are strong and the country is united in a determination to resist. Russia now seems content to wait, confident that thesuccess of her plans in Greece would bring about the collapse of Turkey.Palestine and Arabs States32. Russian support for partition is at first sight surprising, but probablyhas the following motives : (a) Partition will cause the greatest possible disturbance throughout theMiddle East.(b) It will probably be easier for Russian influence to establish itself ina Jewish State than in Arab States. It is quite likely that jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe may be used as the instruments of Soviet penetration. It would be surprising if they, alone of allorbit inhabitants, had been allowed to leave without a strong ulteriormotive, though anti-Semitism no doubt contributed.

(c) Support of Jewish national claims may set a precedent for Armenianand Kurdish national movements.(d) The Jewish extremist movements may well be ready to act on Russia&apos;abehalf against British and American interests throughout the middle east in return for Russia&apos;s support of the Jewish case.(e) The decision to cease comparatively peaceful penetration of Arab Statesthrough existing parliamentary institutions, &amp;c, and to go overinto open and violent opposition to those States may well be parallelto the decision to cease attempts at co-operation with Socialist parties in Western countries and to go over to violent and illegal opposition by strikes and sabotage.33. Communist parties in Arab States, which had before been making some progress in the Lebanon and Iraq, are in a difficult position and have not daredto adhere openly to Russian policy over Palestine. It is by no means out ofthe question, however, that the Russians might at a later stage and in different circumstances switch their support to the Arabs, particularly if Americaninfluence became preponderant in the Jewish State.Persia34. In a recent note to the Persian Government regarding oil rights inNorthern Persia the Soviet Government declared that they regard the PersianGovernment as hostile to them and informed the Persian Government that theyare responsible for the consequences. Thus they have in effect put Persia andthe world on notice that they may well, at such time as seems fitting to them,resume their mischief-making and subversive action against the Persian Govern-ment, though it might be indirect or clandestine and not involve the use of soviet troops.35. Their future action will not doubt follow the pattern of their pastefforts to undermine Persia&apos;s independence which very nearly succeeded. It islikely that Azerbaijan will provide the first objective of any new Soviet driveand there are indications that one may be starting. At the end of Novembera secret broadcasting station, calling itself the &apos;&apos; Azerbaij an Democratic Radio,&apos;&apos;started broadcasting abuse of the Persian Government in the Persian and Turkiianguages. A film has recently been released in the Soviet Union glorifyingthe Azerbaijan rebellion of 1945 and concluding with the slogan &quot; The StruggleGoes On.&quot; The Soviet Union has given refuge to the leaders of the Azerbaijanrebellion who fled from the Persian Government forces in December 1946, andto an Iraqi Kurdish chief who in the last two years has fought against the iraqi and Persian Governments. These men are presumably available to be sentinto Persian Azerbaijan to stir up trouble at any moment.36. Simultaneously, through the action of the Tudeh Party and that portionof the Persian trade union movement which is under Tudeh control, an attempt is being made by the Soviets to gain a dominating position in the Central Govern-ment. The efforts of these instruments of Soviet policy within Persia receiveopen support from outside by means of Soviet press and wireless campaigns and diplomatic pressure. One feature of their mischief-making is incidentally likelyto be an attempt to egg the Persian Government on to attack British interests,e.g., the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company concession or by prosecuting the Persianclaim to Bahrein.The EastSouth-East Asia and the Far East37. In South-East Asia and the Far East the Soviet purpose is two-fold :to turn Asiatic races against the Western democracies and to pose as the championof oppressed colonial peoples. The attack against the Western democracies islevelled at the United Kingdom in Pakistan-India, Burma and British colonial possessions, against the Dutch in the Netherlands East Indies, against the french in Indo-China, and above all against the Americans in China, Japan and Korea.In the general state of ferment in Asia, Soviet policy seeks to exploit localnationalist sentiment through local Communist Parties which, in many cases,contain Moscow-trained elements. For the present, Soviet technique is not fully developed in areas which have not hitherto been subject to Soviet influence ordomination, but with the establishment of Soviet missions in various places (e.g.,New Delhi and Bangkok), the general activity may be expected to increase.34745 c
Afghanistan38. In Afghanistan pressure is not yet strong, but will tend towards thecreation of trouble on Afghanistan&apos;s northern borders, while every eneourage-ment will be given to differences which may arise with Pakistan.Pakistan and India39. In Pakistan and India the Soviet Union seeks to discredit Great Britain,while every advantage is likely to be taken of the differences between these twoDominions to promote discontent and discord. The unfledged state of Burma,which has an active Communist Party, offers opportunities of promoting dissen-sion. In British colonial possessions, such as Malaya, Hong Kong and Borneo,local nationalist sentiment is stimulated against colonial rule, and the sametechnique is adopted by Communist Parties in the Netherlands Indies andPrench Indo-China (in the latter of which there is a very strong communist influence).China40. In China, the Soviet Union seeks to increase its control over Sinkiang,to support the Chinese Communist forces in their effort to obtain complete domina-tion in Manchuria and Inner Mongolia, and to further their efforts to overthrowthe National Government of China. There is a danger that the Communists maysucceed in dominating the whole of China, in which case a considerable political,economic and strategic threat to the territories of South Asia will develop, themore so since there are large Chinese communities in many of these territories.Korea41. In Korea, Soviet-trained Communists, who have already established a virtual police State in the North, may be expected to overrun the whole peninsulawhen American forces are withdrawn owing to the inability of the United states to set up a sufficiently stable administration in the south to counter this Sovietmove.Japan42. The Japanese, by recent history and tradition, are antipathetic to bothRussia and Communism. The degree to which Communism may develop in Japanafter the occupation ceases will depend to a considerable extent on the sentimentsthen prevailing towards the Western democracies.Colonial Territories Generally43. The Soviet authorities carry on perpetual propaganda against the&quot; Imperialist exploitation of colonial peoples.&quot; This is aimed at the exclusion of the Western Powers from colonial territories, the promotion of independencemovements (often nationalistic rather than Communist), e.g., in French north africa and Indonesia, and at teaching colonial peoples to look to the Soviet Unionas their champion and protector. The Soviet Government have made much useof the United Nations, the World Federation of Trade Unions and other bodiesfor colonial propaganda against us; their press and radio constantly pursue thecolonial theme; and they have for years collected agents from colonial areas andtrained them in subversive measures in Russia before sending them back. Hithertothese efforts have not had much success, but this may not last indefinitely. Thepublic relations officer in Nigeria recently commented on the quite remarkableprestige which Stalin and his associates enjoy among the educated and semi-educated classes. He considered that &quot;if it should ever become necessary for usto take a line which would be openly unfriendly to the Soviet Union, we shouldhave the greatest difficulty in putting it across,&quot; and that our chief embarrass-ment would be our inability to meet the Soviet claim to sponsor racial equality.Similar conditions may well obtain elsewhere. Events in Indonesia have pro-vided much grist to the Soviet mill and a recent report from Singapore has statedthat Communist Parties in South-East Asia are growing in strength and presenta serious menace to security in the Far East.United Nations and other International Organisations44. So far as the United Nations is concerned, recent behaviour on thepart of the Soviets suggests that they intend to maintain their membership butto use the Organisation chiefly for propaganda purposes and for rallying theirsatellites and with the object of impeding so far as possible any constructive
jjefforts put in hand by the Western Powers   So long indeed as they retain their^power of veto in the Security Council they will hardly consider that the United^Nations itself constitutes any serious menace to the Soviet Union, though it isfevident that they fear the expression of majority opinion and for that reasonpwiil continue to attack such a body as the Interim Committee.   Indeed we knowIthat Zhdanov himself said recently that it was the Soviet power of veto alonefwhich had prevented the United Nations from attempting to turn the Soviet1 Union out of Eastern Europe.   It seems likely also that the Soviets have by nofmeans abandoned hope of establishing &quot; friendly &quot; Governments in France andIChina.   If only one of these countries became a Soviet satellite it would belimpossible to get the Security Council to pass a resolution condemning the SovietI Union, even in the event of her being a direct party to a dispute.   Should bothIbecome satellites it is obvious that the whole present alignment of forces in the[United Nations would be disrupted, and that the Soviet Union would have agood prospect of acquiring a normal majority favourable to its purposes in theGeneral Assembly. While such a hope exists it appears that there is little prospectof a voluntary Soviet withdrawal.  We may therefore conclude that for some timeto come at any rate the Security Council will be doomed to frustration, but thatthe Assembly (always supposing that Soviet policy is unsuccessful in western europe) may develop into a vigorous body which will serve not only as a platformfor Communist propaganda but also as a suitable vehicle for the expression ofthe point of view of the anti-Communist majority.45. The more intransigent attitude of the Slav bloc has been expressedin other international organisations also, e.g., at the World Federation of TradeUnions. Ever since the establishment of the Federation the Soviet have regarded it as an instrument to be used for political purposes, but have been careful, until recently, to avoid any open conflict with representatives of the countries notsharing their political views. After the Cominform declaration, however, theirattitude was suddenly and aggressively stiffened. Their trade union leaders and press denounced the &quot; Reformist and Conformist influences &quot; in the Federation,and Soviet delegates have been told to make it an active militant order of theworking class movement. The Soviet Government is, therefore, not bothering todisguise its intention of using the Federation to further the aims of theCominform. This means using it against the Marshall Plan, even though suchuse may force a break with the Unions of Western Europe and the C.I.O.46. Similar exhortations towards promoting Cominform aims have beenmade in various sections of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and theInternational Democratic Women&apos;s Federation, though no public lead appearsto have been given by Moscow.-Danger of Soviet Policy to British interests47. Political. From the foregoing it will be seen that the Soviet policy isactively hostile to British interests everywhere. All elements friendly to ours inthe Soviet orbit are being or have been eliminated or removed from&quot; power. a concerted and co-ordinated attempt is being made to spread hatred against usthroughout the world, by representing us with the Americans, as using &quot; directthreats of force, blackmail, extortion, political and economic pressure, bribery &quot;and other unscrupulous means to support our wholly predatory and oppressiveaims. Soviet policy has been sharpened in this respect by their estimate that theTruman Doctrine and Marshall Plan, with the ultimate assurance of effectivereconstruction in western and southern Europe, are contrary to Soviet interests,and must be regarded as aimed against them.48. If the process of communisation were extended to other countries, andmore particularly to France or China, we should be increasingly and dangerouslyisolated, and incidentally might even be forced, together with the United States,into the position of having to make continual use of our veto in the security council. It is to be feared that the immediate Soviet objective is to dominate-Italy, Austria, Greece, France and French North Africa (and presumably theFrench Colonial Empire). They also seek to make serious trouble for us inPalestine and the Middle East and to*undermine Persian independence. success in this plan, even if at the outset only partial, would enable the Soviets effectively to dominate the Mediterranean even without physical control of the western approaches, and threaten our interests in, and communications with the middle east, India and the Far East and with our main reserves of oil in the persian gulf.34745 . -       d
49. Economic-There can be little doubt that the broad objective of soviet policy in the economic sphere is (a) to establish complete control over the territories which it dominates politically, and (6) later to extend its influence over adjacentareas.50. Eastern Europe is in the first category (a) above. In Eastern Europe,though in varying degrees, the Soviet Union has already succeeded in gaininga substantial grip through reparation deliveries, the seizure of ex-enemy assets and the establishment of Soviet controlled banking, industrial and commercialco-operations. By means of bilateral trade agreements, the commercial relations of these territories are being turned increasingly towards the East, though aslong as the West has capital equipment and supplies to offer which the U.S.S.R.cannot provide, trade with the West on a strictly controlled basis, will be permitted. We must expect, however, that in the course of about five years thesecountries will be absorbed almost completely within the Soviet economic orbit.51. The prime example in the second category (b) above is Persia. Here itcan be assumed that the U.S.S.R. is only biding its time before establishingeconomic control by political means. Soviet interest in obtaining control of the oil output of southern Persia is probably due as much to the desire to deprive theWestern Powers of the use of this oil, as to the need for additional oil for itsown use.52. The net economic effect of this situation for the United Kingdom is extremely serious. The deflection of the food resources of Eastern Germany,Poland, and Hungary to the East largely deprives Western Europe of importantsources of non-dollar supplies, and worsens the balance of payments position of western Germany and Western Europe, with incalculable effects upon our own economic position. These losses, however, are trivial compared with the resultwhich would flow from Soviet control of the oil-producing areas of SouthernPersia or from the undermining of our interests in the oil-producing areas ofIraq and the rest of the Persian Gulf.53. It should be noted, however, that Soviet attempts at economic domina-tion have not so far extended beyond the areas over which they exercise some political control. Their attitude towards international economic organisations,which might give them an opportunity of extending their influence in other direc-tions, has been one of indifference. One of their reasons for this attitude may wellbe their desire to prevent any intrusion of Western interests into the areas whichthey control. They do not belong to any of the economic &quot; specialised agencies,&quot;and their interest in the Economic Commission for Europe has been spasmodic,giving no evidence of a considered policy of using this Commission in whichthey could play a dominant role for their own ends.54. Although the Soviet Union is not in a position to dominate the economies of Western Europe, the economic effects of Communist political agitation in thecountries of Western Europe are important. The recent Communist-inspiredstrikes in France and Italy have caused a serious set-back in the economic recovery of those two countries at a very critical period.55. The United States Congress has cut dangerously low the credits for interim aid under the Marshall Plan to both France and Italy. With the furtherset-back caused by the recent strikes the amounts which have been voted are nowquite inadequate to deal with the growing crisis in both countries, and their economic recovery will be still further retarded. Delay in the pace of recovery inEurope has a directly adverse effect on the United &quot;Kingdom economy. UntilEurope has recovered and is able to buy from us with convertible currencies, ourown position of complete disequilibrium with the Western Hemisphere will inevitably continue. Increased production is vital to the recovery of Europe.Anything which hampers production delays recovery and brings chaos nearer. Tothe extent that the Communists are able to foster&quot; labour unrest and so hamperproduction they have a very powerful weapon which they have used very effectivelyand will not hesitate to use again. The loss of production in the recent strikes inFrance and Italy runs into millions of dollars and has made the whole of western europe still more dependent on the United States for the bare essentials of life.56. Political and social unrest in the Far East, much of which is Communist-inspired, is undermining not only the economic stability of the territories inquestion, but is placing in peril our long-standing commercial and financial interests in Asia. The lack of return on our substantial investments in thatcontinent is an important factor contributing to our present financial difficulties.
I 57. Strategic. It seems unlikely that the Soviet Union is making plans tojstart a war with Great Britain or the United States. This is principally for twotreasons. First, the Russians seem to be fairly confident of getting the fruits ofIvar without going to war. This would be facilitated by any weakness, political,Iniilitary or economic, on our part, or by any Russian success in driving a wedgeBetween the United States and ourselves. Secondly, they probably realise that forithe present at any rate their long-term chances in a war against the West are notRood and that the best result, they could hope for would be mutual destruction,llechnically they are still backward compared with the Americans and ourselves,Sand their war losses were heavier. Nevertheless, they still maintain very formidable armed forces. They now have the largest land army, and numericallyithe largest air force and submarine fleet in the world. Their armed forces are[about four times as great as their pre-war strength, and the necessity for militaryIpreparedness is constantly preached. It is true that they have taken the lead in[calling for disarmament, but they have been careful to concentrate their proposalsIon the elimination of weapons in which other people are strong and their general[tactics in disarmament matters have been highly disingenuous. In fact, thefimpression left on me by the New York discussions on disarmament was that the(main Soviet objective was to demobilise or immobilise the rest of the world whilejreniaining mobilised themselves.58. It is evident that if the Russian political plans for Southern and western Europe were to succeed, they would be in a position, with the armedjforces described in the preceding paragraph, to put us in a hopeless position[strategically. Their submarine fleet, in which they are incorporating all the latestiGerman inventions, would be operating from forward bases and would be a serious[menace to our sea communications. They would be in a position to dominate theMediterranean, and the difficulty of defending our interests in Africa and the[Middle East would be immeasurably increased, quite apart from any direct threat[to the Middle East. Without the oil reserves of South Persia and the Middle East[neither the British Commonwealth nor even America can exert their full strength.IFurthermore, the threat to the security of these islands would be very great.Finally, the Russians have developed and improved the Vis and V2s, to say nothing of other secret German weapons and of inventions of their own.\ 59. It is thus evident that the success of Russian expansionist plans would[threaten, if not destroy, the three main elements of Commonwealth defence, the[security of the United Kingdom, the control of sea communications, and the^defence of the Middle East.E.
