I DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY OF HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS   government : i!Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1948SECRET Copy No.CP. (48) 24find January, 1948CABINETRevised Export Programme30TEXTILE EXPORTS AND THE HOME CLOTHING ration memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer was invited by the Production Committee at their meeting on 16th January(P.C. (48) 2nd Meeting) to report to the Cabinet the Committee&apos;s conclusions on the related questions raised in memoranda by the President of the Board ofTrade on the revised export programme (P.C. (48) 8), the report of a working party on the increase of^ textile exports (P.C. (48) 9) and textile exports and the clothing ration (P.C. (48) 11).2. The export programme was last considered by the Cabinet onSeptember (CM. (47) 75th Conclusions, Minute 5), when they approved theprogramme set out in the Annexes to CP. (47) 250, details of which were thenannounced to industry. The sum total of the individual items in the programme would bring exports up to 143 per cent, by mid-1948 and up to 164 per cent,jby the end of 1948. As explained in CP. (47) 250, the programme was drawn[up by the Board of Trade and the other Production Departments, who would,however, need to consult the industries for which they were responsible before final acceptance of the figures. It had been based on the assumption that the steel allocations would match the programme.3.   This programme has now been re-examined in the light of (a) the results of the detailed discussions between the Production Depart-ments and the different industries;(6) the level at which the steel allocations to the engineering industries havenow been fixed for the first two quarters of 1948; and(c) import restrictions overseas.As regards (a), in general the export targets have been accepted as practicableby the industries concerned.  Revision has, however, been necessary in a few casesresulting in a nett loss of about 1 per cent, of the 1938 volume on the end-1948target,   As regards (6), it is estimated that, if steel is delivered at the levellow fixed for the first two quarters of 1948, consequent revision of production programmes in the engineering industries will cause a loss of nearly  9^ million a month on the targets for the end of 1948 or a rate of 12 per cent, of the&quot; volume. As regards (c), while it is impossible to gauge the effect of overseasimport restrictions with any degree of accuracy, it is estimated, on the assumptionthat the position will not substantially alter, that the loss on this account will amount to nearly  4 million a month on the end-1948 targets or a rate of 5 per cent,of the 1938 volume.   Taking into account, therefore, the steel allocations and assuming import restrictions remain as at present, exports are not expected toSceed 134 per cent, of the 1938 volume by mid-1948 (against the present target of 143 per cent.) or 146 per cent, of the 1938 volume by the &quot;end of 1948 (againstpresent target of 164 per cent.).4. Any further significant expansion in exports, to offset the losses resultingfern import restrictions and the shortage of steel, is, in practice, limited to textiles,Hough there can be no hope of bridging more than part of the gap from thatsource. The possibilities in this direction, by increased production and furtherVersions from the home market (the existing export target for textiles is based&quot;t a continuance of a clothing ration of four coupons a month), are referred348291
to in the following paragraphs. The&apos; Production Committee agreed that detailsof the revised export programme, showing the targets for the individual industrialgroups should be included in the Economic Survey, that, in the meantime, no announcement should be made but that suitable publicity on the effects of the steel shortage should be given so as to prepare the way for the announcementof a reduction in the export programme.5 In November the President of the Board of Trade set up an Inter-Depart-mental Working Party to review the position reached in the drive to increasetextile exports and the further steps which should now be put in hand. TheWorking Party Report, and the President^ comments on it, have been circulatedto the Production Committee as P.C. (48) 9. Briefly, the Working Party con-cluded that, as far as overseas market prospects are concerned and on the assump-tion that the output were available, it should be possible to sell very large additional quantities of cotton goods, up to a value, at December 1946 prices, ofabout  4 million per month in addition to the existing end-1948 target. Theseexports would be largely dollar-earning or dollar-saving. The prospects for othertextiles are smaller in scope, but it should be possible to sell extra worsted yarn,and the finer wool cloths, up to a value in excess of the present target of some 1 million per month, and, in addition, perhaps some extra rayon goods (especiallyyarn). The total, including cotton, in addition to the present monthly end-1948target of  28 -1 million, might be nearly  6 million a month.6. The full export potential of the textile industries can be achieved only if urgent steps are taken to make good the large deficiency in the labour force,particularly in the cotton industry, and to see that the best use is made of it. Themain recommendations of the Working Party relate to labour supply and are asfollows : (a) the need for a quick examination of the position in some of the moreimportant cotton towns to ascertain the practicability of various measures for reducing employment in non-cotton occupations;(b) other steps to improve the labour supply of the cotton industry, including a review of female employment in Government industrial establish-ments and of Government contracts placed in cotton areas; efforts toreduce female employment in National and Local Government service in those areas; exemption of cotton workers from call-up for militaryservice; development of travel schemes;(c) guarantee of machinery supplies to the home textile industries to the levelalready approved in the Investment Programme (the revised exporttarget for textile machinery has been framed on this assumption): and(d) the question of exempting cotton mills where overtime is being workedfrom the scheme for staggering hours for peak load considerations.7. Subject to certain points on the method of implementing the recommen-dations made by members of the Production Committee, I am arranging thaturgent action should be taken to follow up the recommendations of the working party and also for the following machinery to be set up for the purpose : (a) A Committee of Junior Ministers under the chairmanship of the Parlia-mentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour, to consider all problems affecting the supply of labour for the textile industry and to submit aprogress report to the Production Committee by the middle of March;and(6) An Official Committee, to be set up by the Minister of Supply and thePresident of the Board of Trade, to make an urgent examination, inthe light of the Evershed Committee&apos;s report, of the machineryrequirements of the cotton industry and of the means by which these might best be met.8. There remains the &quot;question of securing an increase in textile exports by further diversions from the home market. In September last the President of theBoard of Trade made it clear that, for the next rationing period (March-August1948), it might not be possible to continue a 4-coupon rate unless there was asubstantial increase in textile output. An increase of approximately 10 per cent,has, in fact, been achieved and adequate supplies to meet 4 coupons a month willbe in the shops and could not be diverted to export even if the ration were cut.As regards the period September-February 1948-49, a reduction in the couponrate to 3^ coupons (a cut of 6 coupons on the annual rate) should provide, onthe present trend of output, a further contribution to exports of  1-25 million
per month over and above the end-1948 target of  28-1 million; if a reduction toj coupons were made, the total further advantage to export would be another 0*8 million per month (these figures do not, of course, take into account any increase that may result from the implementation of the measures proposed byihe Inter-Departmental Working Party). It is only in woven cotton goods, andlo a smaller extent in yarns, that increased exports to earn or save dollars cantesecured by reduction of the clothing ration. Home supplies of cotton piece goodslave already been planed down to the 3 coupons a month level and for the otherlings comprised in the ration we shall be reaching the ceiling of export salesnotential and at the same time providing for home supplies equivalent to about(coupons a month, with the one exception of yarns. Further reduction of the ration from 3^ to 3 coupons a month would therefore provide export in yarnonly to an amount of about  0 - 8 million per month.Such a reduction involving as it would a cut of 12 coupons in the annualration, would, however, bear with great severity on the home consumer and might lead to a depressing effect on production workers, especially textile operations;it would also create a serious further increase in unemployment in the clothingindustry, and as the increase in export would be mainly in the form of yarn,ii unemployment in the hosiery industry. The Production Committee, therefore,indorsed the Presidents proposal that the ration for the next period shouldtuntinue at the rate of 4 coupons a month but that plans should be made onlie assumption that the annual coupon rate for the period beginning on the1st September should be reduced by 6 coupons, i.e., to a rate of 3^ a month,it this level the ration will be below the wartime level of 4 coupons a monthat a time when wardrobes and linen cupboards are barer. The President felt,therefore, that a ration of 3-g per month was quite as low as we could safely go.The Production Committee consider that in announcing the ration for the march-August period the President should issue a warning that, in view ofthe pressure on steel supplies, it might be necessary to call for an even greaterrontribution to exports from textiles and that the public must, therefore, realise that some reduction in September would have to take place unless there was arery marked increase in production.9.   The position can be summarised as follows : I (a) Owing to the shortage of steel, the existing export programme, which provides for a target of 160 per cent, of the 1938 volume to be reached by end-1948, is no longer realistic.(&amp;) Details of a reduced export programme, taking into account the effect ofthe steel allocations, and allowing for any increases in textile exportswhich can reasonably be counted upon as a result of the measures referred to in (d) and (e) below, should be published in the economic survey, but that no announcement should be made in the meantime.(c) Exceptional action should be taken to increase our exports of textiles,which alone, on market prospects, can make a further significant contribution to our exports.id) The recommendations of the Inter-Departmental Working Party on theIncrease of Textile Exports should be followed up as a matter of urgency through the machinery referred, to in paragraph 7.(e) The home clothing ration for the next period, March-August 1948,should continue at the rate of 4 coupons a month but that for forward planning it should be assumed that the ration will be reduced to3^ coupons a month in the following period and the public shouldbe warned that unless there was a very marked increase in productionit would be necessary to reduce the clothing ration in September.R.
