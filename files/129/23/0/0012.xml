This memorandum has been prepared inconsultation with the other Departments primarily concerned.It will be seen that, on the assumption that we cannot letthese landings pass unchallenged,  three courses appear to beopen to us -(a)    to  take the initiative in an appeal  to the security council;(b).   to use Naval forces to assist the civil Power in enforcing domestic lew;    or(c)    to use Naval forces as such to expel the intruders.The decision reached on the major issue will affect ins to actionwhich will have to bo sent to the Governor, who is about toproceed on a tour of the Dependencies.The pros and cons of each of these courses areanalysed in the paper,  but since each of them have implication.:which go far beyond the responsibility of the Secretary ofState for the Colonies. I have felt it best .to confine myselfto a factual statement of the problem and analysis of thepossible courses of action rather than to submit any formalrecommendation.A. - C.

APPENDIX IARGENTINE LANDINGS on DECEPTION island in THE FALKLAND ISLANDS DEPENDEITCIESI.    Present Situation in the DependenciesOn 25th September the Cabinet considered amemorandum by the Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs,Commonwealth Relations and the Colonies (C.P.(U7T 263), on theproblems raised by the action of the Argentine and ChileanGovernments during the previous Antarctic summer in establishingposts in the Falkland Islands Dependencies,  i.e. the sector ofthe Antarctic over which the United Kingdom Government claimssovereignty.2a In implementation of the decisions reached by theCabinet,  the following action has been taken -(a) After consultation with the Governments of Conrdo,Australia, New Zealand and South Africa who raised no objection,His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors at Buenos Aires and Santiago were instructed to deliver formal notes of protest to the argentine and Chilean Governments respectively (Appendix II).(b) On 19th December,  the Falkland Islands DependenciesSurvey relief ship m.v.  &quot;JOHN BISCOE&quot; sailed for the dependencies,  where she is due to arrive at the end ofJanuary with supplies and personnel for the British posts thor...(c) Naval sloop H.M.S.   &quot;SNIPE&quot; is due to call at Port-Stanley on 11th January,  to pick up holding parties forimmediate transfer to certain of these posts now temporarilyunoccupied,  end to take the Governor of the Falkland Islandson his annual tour of inspection of the Dependencies.3e In the meantime, Argentine vessels (possibly as many as.twelve) have been appearing at or in the neighbourhood ofDeception Island since October and at least eight Argentinenaval vessels,  including two sloops, one transport and someminesweepers, have recently entered the harbour of deception island,  where a British party is in permanent occupation undv,rthe leadership of a British Magistrate.      This Island is undoubtedly the strategic,  political and commercial key to ourSector of the. Antarctic,  as well as one of the places in the dependencies to which our legal title is strongest (seeparagraph 7 below).k* On 27th November the- Governor of the Falkland Islandstelegraphed a report from Deception Island,  to the effect that three separate shore parties had been landed by one of theArgentine vessels,   the  transport &quot;MINISTRO ESCURRA&quot; at pointsround the- harbour and were ostensibly engaged in setting up ameteorological station.      In accordance with his standingpolitical instructions the Magistrate made protests in writing.To  these protests he recently received the following reply: -&quot;With reference to your letter of the19th December to me and Commanding Officers ofthe Ships,  in which you protest against thepresence of ships and disembarkation of menand stores,  I have the honour to inform you that Deception is included in the ArgentineAntarctic end all stores are landed on myauthority.      I recognise no other authority-1-
then that of ray Government, therefore I do notrecognise your pro teat nor seek&apos; the permissionyou refer to&quot;. &gt;  On 21st December a telegram was sent to His MajestyAmbassador at Buenos Aires,  instructing him to deliver asecond protest to the Argentine Government couched, becauseof the- considerations indicated in paragraph 3 above, insomewhat stronger terms than the earlier protest regardinglast year&apos;s events (see paragraph 2 above).      (A copy ofthis telegram is contained in. Appendix III).6. The situation envisaged in paragraph 16 ofCP. (1+7)  263 has therefore arisen.     Argentine Naval Forcesarc openly flouting British sovereign rights at one of thetwo most important islands in the Dependencies.      It is verylikely that both notes of protest to the Argentine Governmentwill be ignored, at any rate for the next few weeks,  if notrejected outright.      Unless restrained by more energeticaction on our part,  the Argentines may very likely be temptedto further encroachments in the area (see Section V below).II.7.Retained under Section 3 (4) of thepublic records actill.IV.    Political Considerations9       Uni ted States A11i tudeThe  traditional United States attitude in theAntarctic has been that the United States Government neither -2- Imakes any territorial claims of its own nor recognisesj those made by other Powers.[10. The State Department were notified informally ofI.the instructions in paragraph 5 above to His Majesty &apos;ambassador at Buenos Aires regarding the Argentine landings&quot;on Deception Island and also of the earlier protests referredI to in paragraph 2.      No very definite reaction has yet been obtained from them,  but a recent interview between a highI official of the State Department and the Counsellor at HisjMajesty&apos;s Embassy in V/ashing ton suggests that, though the&apos; United States Government have not yet formulated any clear-cut Antarctic policy,   they are moot unlikely to supporteither our proposal that the Argentines should apply forBritish leases of their bases in the Falkland IslandsDependencies or our suggestion that the dispute should bereferred to  the International Courts for arbitration.      TheState Department is on the contrary at present inclined to favour the solution of placing the Antarctic under some formof United Nations trusteeship.11. On the other hand there is evidence that the UnitedStates Government is fully alive to the strategic importanceof the dependencies and would be most reluctant to allow anypotentially enemy Power to extend its influence in the area.Our own policy of submitting to the arbitration of theInternational Court holds out a greater certainty than anyother&quot;course (including the contemplated United Statessolution of United Nations trusteeship) of effectivelyexcluding   the U.S.S.R. from this important strategic area.For this reason it should not be beyond the realm of possibility by careful presentation of the facts to persuade the State Department to accept our policy.      But much will depend on the situation on the spot at the time when theUnited States Government is called on to make its decision.The stronger our position in the dependencies both de factoand de  jure the more likely are the United States Governmentto accept as inevitable a solution which might be expectedto give the United Kingdom permanent control of at least- the key points in the dependencies which we have already occupiedand claim to administer.129      Argentine ReactionsThe present Argentine policy of expansion in the antarctic is just another projection of the growingnationalist spirit in Argentina which has caused us so many difficulties in other spheres.     V/e do not yet know their actions to  the protests described in the preceding paragraphs,but it is by no means unlikely that this reaction when it comes will be of a violent nature and may adversely affectAnglo-Argentine diplomatic and commercial relations duringthe coining months.      It is moot unfortunate that a deterioration, of Anglo-Argentine relations should have to beprovoked at a time when our Trade Mission under Sir Clive Baillieuis engaged in a series of delicate negotiations with theArgentine Government to ensure our future supplies of meat and other foodstuffs and to secure markets for our exportsCvu Hng the critical years immediately ahead.
,p .113. These immediate disadvantages will, however, haveto be accepted if the dangers of permanently prejudicingour position not only in the Falkland Islands end theirDependencies but also in our other Colonial possessions in central and South America and perhaps further afield are tobe avoided.     We could in any case probably at best onlypurchase a temporary peace with Argentina on the issue ofDeception Island,  and the likelihood of an even more seriousrupture and an even greater loss of prestige at a later date would remain.V.      The Consequences of Inactionlb. As- was explained in paragraph 3 of CP. (h?)  263British inaction has probably now resulted in the Argentineacquisition of Laurie Island in the South Orkneys.      It willbe seen from the Historical Summary in Appendix IV that it-is only in comparatively recent years that Argentina hasdisplayed any active interest in the South Shetlands.      Itwas no doubt as a result of the knowledge and experience gained last season that the Argentines decided to set up apermament base at Deception Island this year.      If she-established herself with impunity on two places over which british sovereignty is claim id (Deception Island this seasonand G-amma Island last- season) she will be tempted to furtherprogrammes of expansion.15. South Georgia as well as the South Shetland andSouth Orkney groups are included in the area claimed by the argentines.      This island is at present permanently inhabitedby approximately 2,000 persons in summer-time and approximately200 in winter, of whom the majority are Scandinavian and afair minority Argentines.      The next Argentine step is thought likely to be the setting up of posts on this Island.16. We must expect that a failure by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to react with sufficient determination againstencroachments on their uninhabited (or,  if South Georgiais included,  very sparsely inhabited)  territory in the antarctic which they have claimed for thirty years, would greatly encourage the efforts which Latin American countries are at present making to oust iis from the inhabited colonies which they have in Central and South America, namely, british honduras, British Guiana and the Falkland Islands.      As theCabinet are aware,  Guatemala makes unfounded legal claims toBritish Honduras and Argentina to the Falkland Islands.17. In particular, it would certainly influence theattitude taken up towards British Colonial possessions in thewestern hemisphere by the Pan American Union at its forthcoming conference at Bogota, where the subject is already on theagenda.18. Moreover,  should the situation continue to developon these lines, it might well have implications elsewhere inthe Colonial Empire, in other territories against which thereare foreign claims.
VI.    Possible Courses of Action19. There are throe possible courses of action.      Twoof these would involve the presence of naval forces, and ithas been ascertained from the Chiefs of Staff that if theCabinet should decide to take measures which would requirethe presence of naval forces H.M.S.   &quot;SHEFFIELD&quot; (cruiser)could reach the area four weeks after the receipt of orders to proceed there,  and H.M.S.  &quot;NIGERIA&quot; (cruiser)  somewhatsooner.      H.M.S.   &quot;SNIPE&quot; (sloop) would also bo available (see-paragraph 2 (c)  above).20. The  throe possible lines of action to meet thepresent situation are -(c)    To raise the question of the Argentineencroachments and our disputed sovereignty toDeception&apos; Island before the Security Council ofthe United Nations.(b) To instruct H.M.S.  &quot;SHEFFIELD&quot;  (accompanied ifnecessary by H.M.S.   &quot;NIGERIA&quot; and H.M.3.  &quot;SNIPE&quot;)to proceed forthwith to Deception Island and toremain there if necessary until the end of thecurrent Antarctic summer with the object of restoring our authority.      She would be instructedto inform the Argentine party at present encampedon the Island that, having illegally entered  -British territory without permission,  they were liable to prosecution under the relevant laws ofthe Falkland Islands Administration,  and to theappropriate penalties.      The officer commandingH.M.S.   &quot;SHEFFIELD&quot; would accordingly be instructed to assist the British Magistrate byall means within his power to enforce the laws and,  if necessary,  to proceed to the summaryarrest and deportation of any Argentine nationalswho continued to infringe them.     Further ho wouldbe instructed t-.  make it clear that in the view ofHis Majesty!s Government,   the Argentine expeditionwas violating British territorial rights;    thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government were opposed on principle to the use of violence in the settlement ofinternational disputes and would,  therefore,   take no immediate action against Argentine naval vessels in British territorial waters;    but that anyfurther Argentine ships intercepted while attempting to enter the harbour of Deception Island would be resisted by force.      In conveying this warning hewould be instructed to add that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were fully prepared to grant toArgentinians (or Chileans or anybody else withinreason)  the facilities they required for commercial or communications uses provided that they recognisedour title  to the Island.      A similar indication hasalready been given in the diplomatic Notesreproduced i 11 A pp e nd 1 x II.(c) To instruct H.M.S.   &quot;SHEFFIELD&quot; (accompanied ifnecessary by H.M.S.   &quot;NIGERIA&quot; and H.M.S.   &quot;SNIPE&quot;)  toproceed forthwith to Deception Island with instructions to expel the Argentine parties from the island by force if necessary,  and to demand theimmediate withdrawal of the Argentine ships from
British territorial waters.It would from the beginning be made clear,  if either course (b) or ccurse (c) wore adopted by HisMajesty&apos;s Government,  that they would desist from the naval action immediately if tne Argentine    agreed to submit theblatter to the International Court.21. Of these three courses,  course (a) might at first-sight appear to be the most- correct.      It would, however,place us at a disadvantage in that we should bo confronted at&quot;the Security Council with xorescnt-day political argumentsrather than with historical and legal arguments on which curcase is chiefly based (see Sect-ion H abovo).      The presentcomposition of the Security Council must bo taken into account-As from 1st January, 19b8,  the members of the Security Councilother than the five permanent members are the Argentine,Belgium, Canada, Columbia,  Syria and the Ukraine.      TheU.S.S.R.  end the Ukraine may be expected to attempt to makecapital out of our difficulties.      The Argentine, likc-ourselves, would presumably be precluded as a. participant tothe dispute from voting.      On a colonial issue such as this,China, Columbia, and Syria would be likely to vote againstas.      As explained in paragraphs 9-11,  the United states attitude is doubtful and,  in those circumstances, Canadamight find some difficulty in actively supporting - us.      in short, we might find ourselves with very little sympathy .orsupport,  despite the undoubted merits of our case.      HisSJajesty&apos;s Government would no doubt submit to the Council thatthe rest of the dispute is the title to the Island and thatthis was a legal question which should be decided by theInternational Court, but there is no certainty that this is what the Council would recommend.      Course (a) would also openup the whole question of the Antarctic to international discussion which might react adversely on Australia and NewZealand, and would indirectly affect South Africa.      Beforeadopting this course it would,  therefore, be essential toascertain that the Southern Dominions had no objection.22. It is convenient to deal next with course (c)  - the-most extreme course.      In as much as this course necessarilyinvolves the use of force,  it goes beyond what the cabinet have hitherto been willing to authorise for the maintenanceof our title to  the Dependencies.      In adopting this coursewe should weaken our moral position internationally throughbeing the first- to resort to force.      It might also result inour being taken to the Security Council as defendant ratherthan as plaintiff,  a situation in which the difficulties ofobtaining a majority in our favour, which are inherent in course (a), would be aggravated,  though there might be sometactical advantage in the position of defendant.23. There remains the via media,  course (b).      The use ofnaval forces to support the civil power in administering the laws of the territory has certain attractions at first sight.It might, however, necessitate the- forcible arrest and deportation of Argentine nationals in accordance with the falkland Islands municipal law.      It would not involve the useof force against units of the Argentine Navy unless the latter
took the initiative either by attempting to force their way into  the harbour or by resisting the arrest of their nationals on British territory.      On the other hand,under the law as it stands at present,  the correct coursev/ould be  to place  the arrested persons bee!;, on board theships which brought them - i.e.  on board Argentine ships.It seems improbable that the Argentine- ships wouldwillingly either receive them or depart after having done so unless we were prepared in the last resort to usenaval force against them.     Even if the arrested persons were put-on board British ships ana taken to the falkland islands proper for trial (which might involve a preliminaryamendment of the laws)  this would undoubtedly provoke aninternational incident with the Argentine and, moreover,the difficulty about the presence of the Argentine ships in British territorial waters would not be removed.Finally,  although this course may diminish, the danger ofour being taken to the Security Council,  as compered withcourse (c),  and might put us in a less unfavourableposition if we were  taken there,  it would not whollyeliminate the danger.2Lu If either course (b)  or course (c)  is adopted,the Commonwealth relations Office consider that Canada,Australia, New Zealand end South Africa should be informed that once.      They would thus have an opportunity to commentbefore  the British naval forces actually arrived in the dependencies.25. The choice which Ministers make between the abovethree alternatives,  or any other course of action whichmay be preferred, will govern another related question enwhich decisions are also required.      As already mentionedin paragraph 2 (c) of this memorandum,  the Governor of the falkland Islands proposes t.. make a tour of inspection ofthe Dependencies in the sloop H.M.S..   &quot;SNIPE&quot;,  and he is ready to start on the 11th January.      The Governor andthe commanding officer of H.M.S.  &quot;SNIPE&quot; will. requireins truetions whether or not they are to call  at deception island (which would,  of course, normally be included inthe Governor&apos;s tour),  and if a call is made there,  on theattitude which they should take up towards the commanders ofthe Argentine expedition.      If courses (b) or (c) were adopted,  it would seem advisable  that H.M.S.   &quot;SNIPE&quot;, withthe Governor on board,  should not arrive at deception island in advance of the cruiser or cruisers.      On the otherhand, if some course- not involving the despatch of a cruiser is adopted,  it might be considered inadvisable forone British sloop alone to enter these waters and risk arebuff from a numerically superior Argentine force,particularly since the Governor would be on board.      As
against this must be weighed the apparent consequences of the Governor deliberately omitting Deception Islanafrom his tour at the present time.      Instructions onthis point will have to be drawn up between theDepartments concerned in the light 01  the decision taken on the major issue.
Appendix  note of i-Toteat dated 17th jaecember,,  19U7 tothe Argentine GovernmentI;:onsieur le Miniotre,On the 3rd January, 1 Shi, I communicated to YourExcellency, on instructions from His Majesty1s Principal[secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,  a reply to a Note[addressed to me by Dr.  Juan I. Cooke,  dated 3rd June,  19h-6.f?r.  Cooke&apos; s Note had conveyed the views of the ArgentineI government on the issue by the United Kingdom authorities[of a hew series of postage stamps for the Falkland islands and their dependencies.      In my Note No.   5 in reply Iinformed Your Excellency that His Majesty&apos;s Government didnot consider that the Argentine claim to the falkland islands was justified on any grounds whatsoever and, asregards the Falkland Islands T.onendencies, that&apos;His Majesty&apos;sC-overnment considered the Argentine claims to be unfounded.2.      On the 3rd January,  I also communicated to YourExcellency a Note No.  2,  in which, as various statementshad appeared in the press to the effect that an Argentinescientific expedition was to leave for trie Antarctic, Iinformed Your Excellency of the places where the parties ofthe Falkland  Islands Dependencies Survey were carrying out their routine functions in British possessions in the antarctic.      I added that these parties would be happy tohelp Argentine visitors to the extent of their available resources. .  .3.      Receipt of ray Notes Nos.  2 and 3 of the 3rd January wasacknowledged In Your Excellency&apos; s Note of the 15th February, 19h7,in which Your Excellency reserved the Argentine claims to the territories in question.lu      I now have the honour, under instructions from his majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,to make the following communication to the argentine government.5.      His Majesty&apos;s Government have viewed with concern theactivities In British Antarctic territory of the ArgentineNaval expedition which visited parts of the falkland islands Dependencies including Graham Land, South Shetlandsand South OrJsneys during the course of the last Antarcticsummer, landed parties at various points on british territory without making prior arrangements with the competentBritish administrative authorities and in certain casesactually erected what presumably purported to be Argentinemarks of sovereignty.      These visits were made the occasion for formal protests to the Argentine officers concerned bythe local British Magistrates at the occupied posts visitedby them,  and on the 9th April 1SU7 a British Magistrate,,acting on the authority of the Governor of the Falkland.Islands, delivered personally an official note to theofficer in charge- of the Argentine post on Gamma Island inthe Melchior Group - of the Palmer Archipelago informing him that he had perpetrated on act of trespass on territorycommitted to the Magistrate1s chargeby His Majesty&apos;sGovernment...      No reply appears to nave been returned tothis note..His Excellency .Dr.  Juan A. Bramuglia,Minister for Foreign Affairs and Worship,Falacio San Martin,  Buenois Aires.   .-Q-
I0 /[6.      The general position under international law of the falkland Islands Dependencies as seen by.&apos; His Majesty&apos;sGovernment is set out in my Note No. 3 of the 3rd January191+7 to Your Excellency and this position can in no way beaffected by the contents of Your Excellency&apos;s Note of the15th February referred to above.      His Majesty&apos;s government therefore consider that the Argentine claims to territorialsovereignty over the Falkland Islands Dependencies areunfounded;    that in the case of the greater part of these territories an initial British right to sovereignty was first acquired by virtue of discovery:    and that this rightv/as confirmed on the&apos;21st July,  1&apos;908&quot;, and on the 28th March,1917 by the issue of Letters Patent formally reciting the title of the British Crown to the whole of these territories and providing for their administration.      In this connectionYour Excellency,  in Section 2, paragraph 5,  of your Note ofthe 1.5th February, appears ,to be under a misapprehensionregarding the effect of the Letters Patent issued on the21st July,  1908.      The relevant passage of the preamble tothese Letters defined the Falkland Islands Dependencies ascertain specifically named territories &quot;situated in theSouth Atlantic Ocean to the South of the fiftieth parallelof south latitude and lying between the twentieth andeightieth degress of west longitude&apos;&apos;&apos;.      These geographicalco-ordinates are merely a general&apos; description of where thenamed places lie and there is no basis for the interpretationplaced on the passage by Your Ixcellency that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment also claimed that section of the american continent which happens to be contained within these co-ordinates.      Moreover, Argentina failed to protest at thetime against this alleged inclusion of Argentine territory under British jursidiction:    and in any case the letters patent issued in March 1917 modified the definition of the dependencies by substituting a set of geographical co-ordinatesspecifically excluding any part of the South american continent.7.      His Majesty&apos;s Government have hitherto refrained fromcommunicating officially with the Argentine Government on thesubject of the recent Argentine activities in the falkland islands Dependencies because they did not wish to seem to boimpeding any scientific or survey &quot;work being carried out byArgentine expeditions in the Antarctic and because they hoped that the local protests would be reported to theArgentine Government by the naval officers to whom they wereaddressed and result in the necessary permission being applied for through normal channel;:-; for any further visits of this nature.      The establishment, however,  of an apparentlypermanent Argentine meteorological station on Gamma Islandwithout any previous reference to or authorisation from HisMajesty&apos;s Government has rendered it impossible to postponeaction any longer.      I have accordingly been instructed to record a formal protest on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s government against the establishment and continued maintenance of thisunauthorised Argentine post on territory which is, and has for more than AO years been openly administered as a Britishpossession.8.-     I must emphasi.ee to Your Excellency that although HisMajesty&apos;s Government feel that the time has come once more to make their attitude on this matter plain it ia.no partof their intention to exclude from British Antarctic -- 1 0 -
territories scientific parties either from Argentina or fromIny other friendly country.     Having regard therefore to thelegal position set out above I am instructed to suggest thatthe Argentine Government should apply forthwith to Hismajesty!s Government for the lease on terms to be agreed ofthe base which their, nationals have occupied on GammaIsland.      Such an application, which v/ould readily begranted, would have the effect of permitting the work under-taken by the Argentine party there to continue withoutinterruption   and would open the way to closer and more friendly co-operation between British and Argentineexpeditions in the future.      If on the contrary theArgentine Government are unwilling to admit the valid it 2&apos; ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s title to Gamma Island or anyother region included in the Falkland Island Dependenciesand consider that their own title is a good one,  it issuggested that their correct course is not to maintainivithout the consent of His Majesty&apos;s Government an occupiedpost in a territory to which His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;claim of title is universally known and which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have for long actively administered&apos;    but, to invoke the  jurisdiction of the International Court ofJustice at The Hague.      If the Argentine -Government are-prepared to adopt the latter procedure,  in respect of theivorld or part of the area, in question His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would undertake to accept the jurisdiction of theCourt and to abide by its decision.9.      In making the suggestion to the Argentine Governmentthat they should bring their claim to sovereignty in the antarctic before the international Court of Justice, Hisvia jesty&apos; s Government are guided by the following con-slderations:(l)    They are most anxious to preserve unbroken thelong tradition of friendship and co-operation which has characterised Anglo-Argentine relationsever since the inception of the ArgentineRepublic.(2)    They desire in co-operation with, the argentine government to set an example to all thenations of the world of the manner in whichdifferences of opinion can and should be resolved in a spirit of amity and respect for international law.      In this connexionHis Majesty&apos;s Government recall the argentine government&apos;s striking and admirabledeclaration of the 6th July,  19h7,  quoted once again in an address to the General Assemblyof the United nations by the Representativeof Argentine, Dr. force, on the 19th September&apos; in,which it is stated that &quot;peoples and governments must promote the factors leading to world balance which they must base onmutual respect,  juridical equality, obligatoryarbitration, economic co-operation and permanentpeace&quot;.      Ills Majesty&apos;s Government are willingto demonstrate their practical support for theprinciples enunciated by the Argentine Govern-ment in this declaration by undertaking in the -most solemn and. unequivocal manner to acceptthe decision of the International Court ofJustice on the validity of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s title to the area in Question inthe event of the Argentine Government layingtheir claim before that court.-11 -
(3)   His Majesty?s Government desire to give theutmost practical encouragement to the.  exploration and scientific development ofAntarctica by removing all possibility of friction between the expeiditions ofdifferent nationalities.10,    Should, however,  the Argentine Government be unwillingeither to apply to His Majesty&apos;s Government for a lease ofthe base occupied by their nationals on Gamma Island or tosubmit to the International Court for arbitration any claimI to this territory which they may assert, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be reluctantly compelled to request thewithdrawal of the Argentine post from Gamma Island.      Inthe meantime His Majesty&apos;s Government must naturally reserveall their rights to take such action as they may consider appropriate in due course to ensure that their sovereigntyis respected.I avail myself of this opportunity, Monsieur le Ministre,to renew to Your Excellency, the assurances of my highesteons iderat i6n.
i      Your Excellency,1 His Ma jesty&apos;s .Government have viewed with concernI      the activities in British Antarctic territory of the chilean naval expedition which visited parts of the falkland Islands Dependencies including Graham Land andthe South Shetlands, during the course of the lastI       Antarctic summer,  landed parties at various points on british territory without making prior arrangements withI       the competent British administrative authorities, and. incertain cases actually erected what presumably purported to be Chilean marks of sovereignty.      These visits weremade the occasion for formal protests to the ChileanOfficers c en corned by the local British Ivlagist rates at       the occupied posts visited by them, and on the 1hthApril,  -!9h7.  Pi British Magistrate,  acting on theauthority of the Governor of the Falkland Islands,delivered personally an official note to the OfficerI       in charge of the Chilean pest at Greenwich Island inthe South Shetland...;,  informing him that he had trespassedon territory committed to the Magistrate&apos;s charge byHis Majesty&apos;s Government,,      This note formed the subjectof Your Excellency&apos;s notes cf the Ibth May and 3rd june        last.2.      The general position under International Lav/ ofthe Falkland Islands Dependencies as seen by Mis Majesty&apos;sGovernment is set out in earlier correspondence with the chilean authorities and. in particular in the PrimeMinister&apos;s letter of the &apos;! 1 th November,  19h-6,  to the chilean Ambassador in London,  and this position is in no way affected by the contents of the above mentioned notesfrom the Chilean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, nor by tfoeChilean note of the 1hth January.      That is to say thatfor the reasons given in Mr. Attlee&apos;s letter His Majesty&apos;sGovernment consider that the Chilean claims to territorialsovereignty over any part of the British Antarcticterritory known as the Falkland Islands Dependencies areunfounded;    and that the British title to sovereignty rverthis region is not merely based on rights acquired by virtue of discovery or on  the issue of Letters patentformally reciting the title of the British Crown on the21st July 190e (with a boundary readjustment effected onthe 28th March,  19&apos;i7),  but derives also from the measures taken by His Majesty&apos;s Government for the necessaryadministration of these British territories.      As waspointed out in Mr. Attlee&apos;s letter,  the British acts ofadministration in this area include provision for the equitable control of whale and. seal fishing in the general interest, for the accumulation of scientific andmeteorological data,  and for the despatch of numerousexpeditions to the antarctic over h period of many years.3.      his Majesty.&apos;s Government have hitherto refrained from communicating officially with the Chilean Governmenton the subject of the recent Chilean activities in theccellency &apos;rr don German Vergars Donsso,iinist.er f or Foreian affairs irs,SANTIAGO,
Falkland Island;-: Dependencies, because they did not wishto seem to be impeding any scientific or. survey work being carried out by Chilean expeditions in the Antarctic,and because they hoped that the local protests which wcre-reported to the Chilean Government by the Naval officers to whom they were-addressed would result in the necessarypermission being applied for through normal channels forany further visits of this nature.      The establishmenthowever of an apparently permanent Chilean MeteorologicalStation at Discovery Bay on Greenwich Island in the SouthShot lands group without any previous reference- t:   orauthorisation from his Majesty&apos;s Government has renderedit impossible to postpone action any longer.h.      I have therefore been instructed to record a formal protest on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government against  theestablishment and continued maintenance of -this unauthorisedChilean post on territory which is,  and has for more thanh-0 years been,  openly administered as a British  jossossion.5.     Although His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that the time has come once mare to make -plain their attitude on thismatter it is no part of their intention to exclude fromBritish Antarctic territories scientific parties either from Chile or any other friendly country.      Having regardtherefore&apos;to the legal position set out above,   I am tosuggest that the Chilean Government should apply forthwith to His Majesty&apos;s Government for the lease on terms to beagreed of the post which their nationals have occupied onGreenwich Island.     Such an application, which would readily be granted,  would have the effect of permittingthe work, undertaken by the Chilean party there to continue without interruption, and. would open the way to closerand more friendly co-operation between British and Chileanexpeditions in the future.      If on - the contrary the chilean government are unwilling to admit the validity of HisMajesty&apos;s Government&apos;s title to Greenwich Island and consider that their own title is a good one,  their correctcourse is not to. maintain without the consent of HisMajesty&apos;s Government an occupied post in territory towhich our claim of title is universally known and whichwe have for long actively administered;    but,  to invoicethe jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice atThe Hague.      If the Chilean Government arc -prepared toadopt the latter course.  His Majesty&apos;s Government arc- fortheir part prepared to undertake in the most solemn andunequivocal manner to accept the jurisdiction of the Court,and to abide by its decision.&apos;6,      In making the suggestion to the Chilean Governmentthat they should bring their claim to sovereignty in the antarctic before the International Court of Justice, HisMajesty&apos;s Government are guided by.the following considerations:-(i) they are most anxious to preserve unbrokenthe long tradition of friendship and co-operation which has characterised Anglo-Chileanrelations over since the inception of the chilean Republic.
( i i) they de si r e i n c o- op oration w i t h t heChilean Government to set an example to all the nations of the world of themanner in which differen cos of opinioncan and should be ro.solved in a spiritof amity and respect for internationallaw,(iii) tboy desire to give the utmost practicalencouragement to the exploration and scientific development of Antarctica by removing all possibilities of friction between the expeditions of differentnationaliti os *7*     Should however the Chilean Government be unwillingeither to apply to his Majesty&apos;s Government for a lease of the post occupied, by their nationals on GreenwichIsland or to submit to the International Court for arbitration any claim to the territory -in questionwhich they may assort, His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe reluctantly compelled to request the withdrawal ofthe Chilean post from Greenwich Island.      In themeantime His Majesty&apos;3 Government must naturallyreserve all their rights to take such action as theymay consider appropriate in due course to ensure thattheir sovereignty is respected.I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration.(S gd)    J.

December, &quot;1947.Repeated to Washington No. 1320 Santiago No. 396.Addressed to Buenos Aires No.  8-i0 of the 21st December.Repeated for information to Washington and Santiago.My telegram No.  78k /of the &quot;16th December: Protestto Argentine Government on the Antarctic/.1.     Governor of the Falkland Islands Dependencies hasreported visits to Deception Island in the South Shetlands,of at least eight Argentine naval vessels in recent weeks,including the transport Ministro Ezcurra, the minesweeperBouchard and the sloops Granville and King.      Formal protestsagainst the unauthorised presence in British waters of thesevessels have. &quot;been delivered where appropriate to theirCommanders by the resident British magistrate and furtherprotests have &quot;been made to Commanders of Granville and Kingagainst landings effected &quot;by their crews on the Island.On 20th November in spite of protest by the magistrate theKing landed three parties, now established in tents, atTelephone Bay, Pendulum Gove,  and another un-named inletsituated  inside the main herDour of Deception Island.Parties are believed to &quot;be making tidal and meteorologicalobservations with a view to establishment of a permanentmeteorological station.2.This is a copy, the original is closed undersection 5.1 of the public records act3.      It is therefore essential to take special steps to.protect our title to Deception Island additional to thoseenjoined to my despatch No.  362 as amended by mytelegrams Nos.  720 and ?U7. .  You should accordingly makean immediate approach to the Argentine Government on thefollowing lines referred to your previous note on lastyea.r &apos; s encroachment s;(a)   Kis Majesty&apos;s Government have noted with surprisethe continued acts of trespass which are atpresent being committed by Argentine ships on British territory and British territorial waters In the South Shetland Islands and,  in particular,the recent landings effected without permission of His Majesty&apos;s Government by Argentine naval personnel on Deception Island.British Sovereignty over Deception Island has beenestablished by innumerable nets of administrationsince its discovery by a British naval officer in1819 and by several periods of continuousoccupation since the formal annexation of theSouth Shetland group by Letters Patent  issued in 1908.      For example in 1 9&apos;i 2 there were twelvewhaling factory ships and. 32 whale catchersengaged in fishing in the South Shetlands under british licence.      In that year the) HectorWhaling Company took a 21 years lease fromHis Majesty&apos;s Government of a shore station onDeception Island and by 19&apos;lh one British, oneChilean and eight Norwegian &quot;haling companies were operating in the South Shetlands area under British licences renewable;annually.Between 1908 and 193O a British stipendarymagistrate was in permanent residence on the island each Summerf and was in effective controlof all whaling operations in the South Shetlandsand Graham Land area.      Between 1927 and 1938regular annual visits to Deception Island were paid by ships sent out by the Discovery Committeeengaged in surveying, marine research, and scientific work.      In 1941 His Majesty&apos;s Ship&quot;Queen of Bermuda&quot; visited Deception Island inorder to see to the destruction of fuel left bythe Hector Whaling Company.      In 1943 H.M.S.CARNARVON CASTIS landed at Deception Island and left a writ at the shore Whaling Station taking over on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government thebuildings and plant of the Hector WhalingCompany whose lease had then expired.    In 1944H.M.S. WILLIAM SCORE SHY&quot; established apermanent occupied post on the Island with a fully equipped Meteorological station, andMagistrates for the South Shetlands Groupwere sworn in by the Governor of the falkland islands.      In February 1946 Deception Island wasonce- more constituted a public telegraph office.On the 3rd January 1947 the Argentine Governmentwere officially informed (in your Note No.  2) ofthe presence of a Falkland Islands Dependencies- Survey party on Deception Inland.The Argentine Government will appreciate from these and other examples of the exercise of british sovereignty that His -Majesty&apos;s Governmentpossess an incontrovertible legal title toDeception Island.      In these circumstancesHis Majesty&apos;s Government cannot any longercondone the unauthorised presence on this island of Argentine parties and must request that theArgentine Government should either apply forth-with to His Majesty&apos;s Government for a grant ofthe facilities desired or else send instructions for the early departure of their nationals fromthe Island.
(d)    As in the case of Gamma Island and any other part of the Falkland Islands Dependencies,His majesty&apos;s Government are prepared toaccept the jurisdiction of&quot;the international court of justice at The Hague should theArgentine Government wish to dispute HisMajesty&apos;s Government&apos;s title to deception island, and are, therefore, willing that theArgentine Government, should instituteproceedings at The Hague.   &apos;  Unless, however,the Argentine Government are prepared toadopt one of the three courses indicated above, His Majesty&apos;s Government must reserveall their rights to take such action as theymay consider appropriate in due course, toensure that their sovereignty is respected.!i.     As in the case of your x^rotest regarding Gamma Islandyou should explain informally that in order to allow theArgentine Government the opportunity to consider the above proposals without embarrassing publicity, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment proposes to refrain from immediate publication ofthe present communication, but must request an early reply.5.      For your information, British sloop H.M.S. SNIPE isdue to arrive about mid-January at Port Stanley and willtake Governor of Falkland Islands on tour of Dependencies.Colonial Office and Admiralty will be consulted regardinginstructions to be issued to the Governor and commanding officer in the event of meeting with units of ArgentineNavy or Argentine shore parties established in british territory.      Terms of these instructions (which will becommunicated to you as soon as possible) will, to someextent,  depend on reaction of State Department andArgentine Government to notes of protest.
/ATENDIX_IVHistcrical note on the South. Shetland  Islands,with &quot;special rGference to Deception Island.i.      The South Shetland Islands, which were formally annexedby means of Letters patent in &apos;$08, form one of the fiveDependencies of the Falkland Islands Colony.      The groupconsists of nine main islands extending in a chain about300 miles long north eastwards from Graham Land,    theNorthern tip of the Antarctic Continent.      Discovered by aBritish vessel in 1819,  they were exploited during the nineteenth century by British and American sealers.      the exploration and more accurate&apos; charting of the group has beenaainly carried out by British expeditions during the last!i0 years.      There are numerous anchorages, but only two reallygood,harbours suitable for large vessels - at Admiralty Bayon King George Island and at Deception Island.      Of thesetwo harbours Deception Island is incomparably the superior.During the present century these two harbours have beenimportant whaling centres.2.      Modern whaling in this area was started in 1905, andthe first British licence,  issued under Falkland IslandsWhaling Ordinances, was granted in 1907.      Subsequently, allwhaling in the territorial waters of the South Shetlands has been carried out under British Licence.      The Governor ofthe Falkland  Islands in Council was continually and effectively exercising his authority to control the industryin the interests of revenue, the conservation of the stock of whales, and the prevention of unnecessary waste.3.      In October .1912 Deception Island was established as a:?ort of Entry for shipping,  and the&apos;British Customs officer who had hitherto proceeded annually to the Dependency wasgiven an acting commission as Magistrate and Coroner.    Fromthis date until 193C when the introduction of pelagic whalingmade shore stations redundant, a British Magistrate wasresident ashore at Deception Island throughout each whalingseason.k.      Between 1930 and the present time there has been nowhaling bases on Deception Island, but it has always seemed probable that the industry would return to the SouthShetlands,  and the Colonial Office is now considering anapplication for a new lease of the old shore station.    From1931 to 1944 Deception Island was unoccupied.      However,brief visits to the island were made by the  ships of the discovery Committee in each season until their work was interrupted by the outbreak of war in 1939.5.      In March 1.91+1 BAM.8.  QUEEN OF BERMUDA visited the island to destroy the- oil installations and remaining stocksof coal, which it was. feared might bo used by enemy raiders.6.      In January 1942,  following a policy to extend Argentineterritorial claims in the Antarctic while Groat Britain was occupied with other; commitments,  an argentine vessel visitedDeception Island, painted the national colours on the wallsof the British factory, and formally took possession of the island.      Following this action, and anticipating that the --1 9-
jArgentine Government intended to make further encroachmentsI in 1943, the War Cabinet approved on 28th January,  1943,that H.M.S.  CARNARVON CASTLD should make a round of visits to the islands.    Accordingly, on 30th January theCARNARVON CASTLE landed a party at Deception Island tohoist the Union Jack and obliterate all traces of theArgentine visit.7.      Diplomatic representations at this stage were unsuccessful in arresting Argentine intentions.      InFebruary 1943 an Argentine party removed the British emblemsand replaced them with Argentine emblems.      It was therefore decided.,  in accordance with the Cabinet decision of January1943,    to install a permanent British occupation party onthe Island,  and on the 6th February, 1944, a fully equippedmeteorological station was established.      The island hasbeen continuously occupied since that date;    the meteorologicalstation forms one of the chain of seven British posts now established in the Dependencies.      Further diplomatic re-presentations during 1 944, .1945, 1946 - and 1947 aboutincreasingly provocative Argentine actions elicited noresponse except unco; npr omising assertions of Argentinerights, which.are said to be based on succession to thisterritory as the heirs of Spain and the grounds ofgeOgraphic a1 c ont i guit y.8.      Between January and -larch 1947 Deception Island wasvisited repeatedly by six different Argentine ships.Numerous landing parties went ashore and the BritishMagistrate protested against their unauthorised presenceon British territory.      The exchanges were friendly and merely stated formal reservations by each party.      Itappeared to the British Magistrate that at first the argentines were nervous and expected to be turned out.Throughout trie summer they gained confidence as -they realised that the British parties were able to make no more than formal protests,  and appeared to have beenenpuraged to extend their unopposed encroachments in the dependencies next season.      In the 1946-47 season, however,the Argentines confined their activities to formalreservations at the British posts and the establishment ofa meteorological station in the Melchior Islands, a groupsome considerable distance from any British post.9.      On 25th October,  1947, as soon as ice conditionspermitted the Argentine minesweeper BOUCHARD arrived atDeception Island.      The British Magistrate again made a formal protest, to which a formal reply was made assertingArgentine sovereignty over the island ana denying Britishauthority.      Further Argentine ships began to arrive, and on12th December,  the Governor of the Falkland Islands reportedthat sir were anchored at Deception Island, while three furtherArgentine ships and a landing barge had been reported inthe vicinity.    Landing parties have set up tents ashore,and the Argentines have announced uheir intention, to set upa meteorological station on the island.      &quot;While the BritishMagistrate is doing everything he can to discourage such a project.,  there is nothing that he can do beyond the .delivery of further protests.      It is evident from the number of argentine ships present that the Argentine government intends either to set up elaborate installations atDeception Island or to establish additional posts at other points in the Dependencies in complete disregard of therepeated British representations which have been made .both on the spot and through diplomatic channels.
