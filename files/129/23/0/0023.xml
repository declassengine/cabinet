DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1948SECRET - Copy No.CP. (48) 2319$ January, 1948CABINETNATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE : ATTITUDE OF THE MEDICALPROFESSIONMemorandum by the Minister of health in view of the current publicity given to the attitude of the doctors to theforthcoming National Health Service, my colleagues may like a report from measures to the present position.First, the facts. The doctors have been taken into consultation on everyissue arising on the new service, by my predecessors under the previous Govern-ment and by myself, since 1943. There have been discussions with various groups of the doctors&apos; representatives which total, according to mv records, about fiftymeetings. Many have been taken by officers of my Department, some by myself and my predecessors.   In 1947 alone there were twenty-three discussions.All of this culminated in a two-day meeting of their Negotiating committee with me in December last.Then the B.M.A. circulated to all doctors a detailed statement of their case.I similarly circulated my detailed answer.   These two documents are appendedin case any of my colleagues wish to study them.   After this the B.M.A. held a meeting of some 300 spokesmen from different parts of the country and passed-a resolution in the following terms : &quot; The elected representatives of the medical profession in Great Britainand Northern Ireland, meeting in London this eighth day of January, 1948,solemnly declare that in their considered opinion the National Health service act, 1946, in its present form is so grossly at variance with the essentialprinciples of our profession that it should be rejected absolutely by allpractitioners.&quot;The B.M.A. now propose (at the end of this month) to hold a &quot; plebiscite &quot;of all practitioners which, it is understood, is to take the form of a paper tobe signed by each voting doctor, to contain the resolution above, and to ask himi whether he approves of the Act and whether he is ready to abide by the decisionof the majority vote.In preparation for this &quot; plebiscite&quot; an intensive&apos; campaign is beingIconducted to persuade doctors to reject the Act. Branch meetings of the B.M.A.ai&apos;e being held all over the country at which officially sponsored speakers urge(the doctors to reject the Act. Press and publicity campaigns are in full swing,ieven including the use of the film news-reel. All is being organised by Dr. Hill,[the secretary of the B.M.A.I The attack is upon almost every main feature of the Act the abolition ofthe sale of practices, the right of the Government (through a specially constitutedDiedical body) to say that a particular area does not justify an increase of public expenditure because it has enough doctors already, the introduction into remunera-tion of a  300 fixed payment element (the rest being on the familiar capitationoasis), the appeal to the Minister where a special Tribunal has said that a doctor is not fit to continue in the service (they want to appeal to the High Court),34819 b
the selection of suitability in doctors undertaking midwifery instead of lettinothem all do it regardless of qualification or experience, the taking over o\hospitals, the constitution of local authorities&apos; Health Committees, and so on.So much for the facts. From all the evidence the speeches of their spokesmen and, above all, Dr. Hill it is quite clear that this is, on the part of theB.M.A., an attempt not merely to seek detailed improvements of the Act bulcompletely to sabotage it and prevent its ever coming into operation. Forexample, in his news-reel address, Dr. Hill says : &quot; The doctor should be youiservant, not the State&apos;s servant. You should choose him, or change him &quot; (which of course, the Act already allows). He goes on : &quot; As a salaried officer of theState &quot; (which he is not). . .&apos;. Then he makes this statement: &quot; Tbe real issue is not whether you want a better health service (everyone wants that) but whether you want your doctor to be your doctor or the State&apos;s doctor. There is somethingpersonal in medicine, something in the doctor-patient relationship, somethingprivate and confidential which is essential to good medicine. Break into that,make the doctor not your doctor but the State&apos;s doctor; no longer your friend,your advocate, and you will have done some damage to medicine that it willbe impossibls to repair. Doctors believe that their freedom as a profession and!as individuals is your freedom, and that is what they are fighting for.&quot;This scarcely needs comment. Dr. Hill knows very well that the personalrelationship, freedom of choice and freedom to change, is maintained in thenew Act. If what he declares to be their aim were to be accepted beyond that,nothing but private practice would remain. But Dr. Hill is the acceptedConservative candidate for Luton, and it would be a feather in his cap to try to enter Parliament as the Conservative who stopped a major social measureof this Government.As to the Press reception? It mainly follows the usual lines of politicalpersuasion, inevitably and is certainly not all favourable to the doctors&apos; attitude.But one can pick out of it a few points genuinely made by, on the whole, reasonablecritics.  I will deal with these next.There is one point on which I have always agreed that we are on uncertainground. I will not bother my colleagues with legal details, but in brief itis not certain that the Act sufficiently protects doctors under existing financialpartnership obligations to each other. I am asked to clarify the position inan amending Bill, and should like to do so. But the difficulty is that neither side can say for certain what should be put in such a Bill. Their legal advice and mine differ and we do not know which is right. So far, I have assureddoctors that, as soon as a Court decides we are wrong and in what way weare wrong, I will seek the appropriate amendment. But I think that rather more assurance is justifiable. I am proposing now to announce that, in viewof the uncertaintjr, I shall appoint a small committee of, say, five independent and well-known lawyers to examine the Act and to advise me in what way (ifany) it fails to protect the rights of partners under existing partnership agree-ments and how its defects (if any) could best be rectified at law. I should thenundertake, on the receipt of their report, to introduce any amending legislation on this point which seemed appropriate. I believe this would help considerably in showing good faith and calming the legitimate doubts of some doctors.Another point often genuinely put forward is that, where the special Tribunalrules that a doctor is not fit to continue in the service, appeal should lie to theHigh Court and not the Minister. This, I am sure, is simply a misconception ofthe proper constitutional position. It is proper for a Court to say whether&quot;dismissal &quot; is wrongful at law, but not if it is lawful to say that it is wrongon merits. The more genuine critics on this are simply confusing the two things.To accept the second would lead to impossible consequences in other fields ofemployment apart from obliging a Minister to continue to be answerable forthe negligences of a doctor whom the Courts would not allow him to disown.Thirdly, there is criticism in unbiased circles that I do not abandon the 300 &quot;fixed &quot; element in remuneration. The doctors say it is the thin end ofthe wedge and could lead to a full-time salaried service later. But a full-timesalaried service later would be exactly as possible with the  300 now as with it.Moreover, a full-time salaried service has been possible under National HealthInsurance for 36 years and does not seem to have worried them before! In my view the  300 fixed element, on top of which the rest of payment is by capitationaccording to the number of patients, has great advantages for the beginner-giving him an assured living while he collects patients and, for the other doctors,is a convenient peg on which to hang additional fixed payments (such as&quot;inducements&quot;  to go to  unpopular  or  sparsely  populated  areas).    The
Biromise of having a &quot; fixed &quot; payment only for beginners or other groupsd involve administrative difficulty in applying varying rates of capitation.As to my own action?   I have so far taken the view, certainly until the plebiscite,&quot; that I will not be drawn into an exchange of propaganda whichyd make the doctor&apos;s position in the new scheme seem to be governed merelypolitical doctrine and in which I should be at an inevitable disadvantage withupetitors who need not be, and are not, scrupulous about the truth of their facts,itoing, I believe, could prevent the doctors as an organisation from votingainst the Act this month.   That does not mean that they will not, asjividuals, take part in it.   If we keep firmly to our &quot; appointed day &quot; those10 do not take part will (a) lose their present panel income, (6) lose their right&apos; share in the  66,000,000 compensation for capital values when they later come(e) lose all right to have any private patient in any pay-bed in any hospital.money could only succeed if they were to push us off our appointed day and delayis whole service.Meanwhile, I propose to build up accumulating evidence in the Press andsewhere that the Act goes on, that I am setting up the machinery piece by pieceid that they are not affecting the progress of the preparations. I propose tosliver, in due course, a guide to the new service to all households, to publish alie booklet on it, to run films on it and generally go on with the explanatoryjork which is most likely to create public demand and thus affect the doctors&apos;bsition more and more if he sabotages it.\ It is the period between their vote and the appointed day which will befficult for the B.M.A. in continuing to keep up the resistance. It is that periodhich I shall use to make clearer and clearer that, for the decent doctor, there issquare deal and for the public an essential service. I do not believe that the.MA. can ultimately face being the only obstacle to the public using that service,hove all, we must adhere to the appointed day unless we want it to be knownat a sectional group have succeeded, in their own words, in &quot; rejecting &quot; anIt of the present Parliament.A.

THE NEGOTIATING COMMITTEES CASEPRELIMINARY&apos;)n Feb. 7, 1947, the Negotiating Committee of the profession passed the following resolution:t the Committee express its willingness to enterdiscussions with the Minister on the basis of alution passed on Jan. 28 by the Representativeof the British Medical Association, which he accepted.nsolution passed on Jan. 28, 1947, by the Repre-ive Body of the British Medical Association wasfollowing terms:jat the Association, having considered the final results,-M plebiscite and the Ministers letter of Jan. 6 to theMcnts of the Royal Colleges and desiring to secure for people the best pdssible health service, is willing thatssions be entered into with the Minister to that end,Sided that such discussions are comprehensive in theirand that the possibility that they may lead to furtheration is not excluded ; and that after the conclusion of discussions, a second plebiscite be taken on the issuetering the Service.29, 1947, this resolution was conveyed to thepry of the Ministry, who replied in the followingHill, Jan. 31, 1947.it to thank you for your letter of Jan. 29 and for sendingcopy of the resolution passed by the Special Represents-fating of the B.M.A. on Jan. 28.Minister wishes me to say that he has considered theof the resolution and will be glad if the NegotiatingIttee will resume discussions with him, in the light of^solution, at their early convenience.Yours sincerely,(signed) Wm. S. Douglas.2. The Minister, having accepted the resolution of theRepresentative Body of the British Medical Associationas the basis of discussion, met the Negotiating Com-mittee on Friday. Feb. 28. The Minister informed the negotiating Committee that there would be no limit tothe character of the discussions and that he did notwithhold the possibility of amending legislation. Onthis assurance the Negotiating Committee agreed to setup a number of subcommittees to discuss with repre-sentatives of the Minister the subjects falling within their respective fields. Subcommittees dealing withHospital and Specialist Services, General Practice.Public Health Services. Mental Health Services, Oph-thalmic Services, and Superannuation were accordinglyestablished, and 31 meetings have taken place betweenthem and the Ministers representatives. These sub-committee discussions have now been completed.3. In this memorandum the more important repre-sentations made by the various subcommittees to theMinisters representatives are gathered together for presentation to the Minister personally, with therequest that he should now reply to the points made and die arguments adduced in their favour. The dis-cussions have been comprehensive and, as the possi-bility of amending legislation was admitted, the negotiating Committee asks that, after considering this memorandum, the Minister will seek, by amend-ment of the Act where necessary, to have changes made to meet the points raised by the Committee.THE PROFESSIONS AIMThe medical profession itself has provided the impetus towards the establishment of a compre-$e medical service. From time to time since 1920evolved statements of policy and published con-jive proposals, all with the object of arousing publicpand stimulating governmental action to this end.differences as have arisen between the Government. pie main body of the profession relate not to the&quot;ye itself, but to the means proposed to achieve(jective. In particular, the medical profession isirned to ensure that the interests of the public andSession are not harmed by forms of organizationand service which, while not essential to the achieve-rnent of the object, may endanger the character of theprovision for the public and imperil the freedom of themedical profession.5. The Negotiating Committee adheres to the state-ment of principles first published on Dec. 15, 1945:I. The medical profession is, in the public interest,opposed to any form of service which leads directly or indirectly to the profession as a whole becoming&apos;full-time salaried servants of the State or localauthorities.HIm
II. The medical profession should remain free toexercise the art and science of medicine according toIts traditions, standards, and knowledge, the individualdoctor retaining full responsibility for the care of the patient, freedom of judgment, action, speech, and publication, without interference in his professionalwork.III. The citizen should be free to choose or changehis or her family doctor; to choose, in consultationwith his family doctor, the hospital at which he shouldbe treated, and free to decide whether he avails him-self of the public service or obtains the medical servicehe needs independently.IV. Doctors should, like other workers, be free to choose the form, place, and type of work they preferwithout governmental or other direction.V. Every registered medical practitioner should beentitled as a right to participate in the public service.VI. The hospital service should be planned overnatural hospital areas centred on universities in orderGENERAL7. The two features of Part IV of the Act which havearoused the gravest misgivings of the medical profes-sion ,are the abolition of the custom of buying andselling general practices and the establishment of ainachlnery of &quot; negative direction &quot; over the movements of general practitioners. In its published, comment onthese features of the Act, issued by the Negotiating(^committee in November, 1946, the following statementappeared:The Act provides for the abolition of the customof buying and selling general practices and for theestablishment of a machinery of negative directionover the movement of general practitioners, whilethe profession maintains that the ownership of good-will is essential to the continued freedom of the general practitioner. This abolition is regarded as a first and substantial step to a State salaried service, while thesystem of &quot; negative direction &quot; which is proposed isan unjustifiable and unnecessary interference with thefreedom of the doctor. Any necessary improvementin the distribution of doctors can be achieved on theexisting basis of general practice.The abolition of the custom of buying and sellingpractices creates more problems than it solves.Distribution8. The question of distribution of the profession istaken first because it is upon the need for better distri-bution that the Minister based.his arguments for theabolition of the ownership of goodwill in public general practice.Problems of distribution can be met in a satisfactory way by dealing with any cases of under-doctoring asthey actually exist or occur. No areas will remain under-doctored because of inability to purchase medi-cal service, for, as a result of the Act, there will beavailable a medical payment in respect of every memberof the community. The medical payment will be thesame in respect of every patient, wherever he lives and whatever his status. Doctor-distribution in relation topopulation-distribution will follow naturally upon a100% service. When stability has been reached anyremaining deficiency in medical manpower in particularlocalities can be effectively remedied by adjusting the- that these centres of education and research Iinfluence the whole service. aVII. There should be adequate represcntaticJjthe medical profession on all administrative be associated with the new service in order that dcxmay make their contribution to the efficiency olservice.6. In this memorandum the Committee concenton those aspects of the Governments scheme wappear to it to need modification. There are owhich are commended or accepted by the profesincluding the principle that the service should be aable to the whole community, the proposed plan and development of hospital services on regional 1and the general structure of local executive counci(Note. In general, the principles of the NegouiCommittee&apos;s case are applicable to the Scottish A(well as to the Act for England and Wales, withSecretary of State taking the place of the Minister]PRACTICE1terms and conditions of service so as to attract to under-doctored area the medical practitioners whoneeded, even to the extent of an appointment by minister of a doctor on special terms.The discontinuance of the traditional methodtransfer of and succession to practices creates fproblems of distribution.9. The Act provides that every practitioner see kitenter general practice in the public service in anyafter die appointed day must first obtain the permisof the Medical Practices Committee and, as is shsubsequently, in no case will the granting of this mission be a mere formality. An examination ofprocedure proposed demonstrates that it will hcumbersome and slow-moving business. An illustrcof this is afforded by the course of events on the ocrence of a doctor&apos;s death. The Local ExeciCouncil, being informed of this event, must first thereto the Medical Practices Committee on the necessitfilling the vacancy. The Medical Practices Commwill need local knowledge before it can determineissue. Neither in these nor in any other circumstawill the Medical Practices Committee be able toon overall figures for general practitioners and pottion in the area, for the experience of the Central MeWar Committee proves that the over-doctoredcontains under-doctored patches and the under-doctarea contains over-doctored patches. It is no helppatient of the deceased doctor to explain that, itcounty as a whole, there are sufficient medical prtioners. The Medical Practices Committeeexamine the report of the local committee befodecides whether or not to fill the vacancy.Let it be assumed that it is decided to fill the vac;Presumably, the Local Executive Council or the MePractices Committee will advertise and candidates&apos;duly apply. It will fall to the Local Executive Coiflin consultation with the Local Medical CommittaHexamine the applications, to interview the candidand to arrive at a short list for recommendation tSMedical Practices Committee.

Such appeals hfi
considered, the final decision will be reached andt^tor will be chosen to fill the vacancy.ij But what has happened in the meantime?  At aKpvative estimate the procedure outlined above willtaken some three or four months.  In the mean-the Local Executive Council is responsible for -jig medical care for the patients of the deceasedKioner. s The Council may ask the neighbouringEjtjoriers to undertake the work.   If they agree, itHpflble that after three or four months many of theKts of the deceased practitioner will have transferred% lists of the neighbouring practitioners, leaving[practice for the appointee on arrival,the other hand, the neighbouring practitioners mayigree to undertake the work, or their lists may&quot;in heavily burdened that they cannot undertake extraEi,and the Council may appoint a locum. After threeisr months the locum may be generally acceptedjg patients of the practice.  The widow may haveEjthe house to him (or she may have sold it to anotherEoror to a layman).  It is difficult to see how theEjjjcal Practices Committee could make yet anotherEge and bring in a fresh practitioner.Many of these difficulties arise from the fact thatthe moment of her husband&apos;s death the widow hasinterest in the practice as such and owing to thejbersome machinery neither the Local ExecutiveKail nor the Medical Practices-Committee can effec-idy replace her in this respect.12. Examples could be multiplied of the difficultiesih will arise.  Sons will join fathers only with thejjanission of the Medical Practices Committee.   The111 decision as to whether the incomer shall be malefemale, young or old, British or alien, lies with committee remote from the area. The burden of work&apos;jjg on the Medical Practices Committee will be in-Etrably heavy. For in every case which comes beforepnotice there will need to be inquiry into the circum-Eaces of the particular area, in order to determinenether or not there is a sufficiency of doctors in it.Is is a burden which no committee can dischargepriently.   The average number of additions to theicaJ Register during the last five years is nearly 3,000it, and the removals from the Register on death,during die same period average 1,100 a year,fa an area, or part of an area, covered by say twoktors the Medical Practices Committee may decidepat a vacancy arising from the death or retirement ofmeed not be filled. The effect would be to compelpatients of the vacant practice to secure their medicalfention from the practitioner remaining in the area Ho is not the practitioner of their choice, but the petitioner from whom those patients have chosen not obtain their medical service.13. There is another feature of the Act which con-iravenes the fundamental principle that the citizenbold be free to choose or change his family doctor,jption 34 (4) empowers the Medical Practices Com--ttce to grant an application to practiseSubject to conditions excluding the provision ofgeneral medical services by the applicant in such partor parts of the area of the Executive Council as theCommittee may specify.&quot;io restrict a doctor*s practice, for example, to a par-feolar part of the town is to deny his services to patients&quot;to may wish to obtain them and to compel those $feats to seek treatment not from the doctor of theirSpebut from some other practitioner. This objectionIpffa whether an area is held to be under-doctoredor over-doctored. The present arrangement, which has worked satisfactorily over many years, gives discretion to an insurance practitioner to accept any person onhis list whether or not the person lives within the areaordinarily covered by the doctor&apos;s practice.Ownership of Goodwill14. In the discussions which have taken place betweenthe Ministers representatives and the Committee, theCommittee&apos;s original statement that &quot;the abolition ofthe custom of buying and selling practices creates moreproblems than&apos;it solves&quot; has been abundantly justified.Some examples of the problems created are given below.Existing Partnership Agreements15. Practically every existing partnership is governed by an agreement. In general, these agreements provide that in certain circumstances e.g., the retirement, death,or sickness of one partner, the other partner, or partners,shall have an option, and often an obligation, to purchase the share of die partner retiring or dying.16. So far as these partnership agreements are con-cerned the interpretation which the Ministry places onSection 35 of the Act on the advice of its legal advisersis:&quot; (a) Existing partnerships between doctors are not deter-mined on the appointed day, nor is there any reason forpartners to determine existing agreements. The position isthe same whether all or any of the partners in a partnershipjoin the new service.&quot; (b) Clauses relating to the sale and purchase between part-ners of shares in the goodwill of the practice or the option to purchase such shares contained in a partnership sgrssnssntentered into before the appointed day will be unaffected by part IV of the Act coming into operation on the appointed day and will remain operative. An obligation in such anagreement by a partner who joins the new service to buyfrom or sell to another partner a share in the practice, orthe right of such a partner to exercise an option to buy orsell a share, either on a fixed day or the happening of an event after the appointed day, will continue as a right orliability of the partner concerned. No such sale would con-stitute an offence under Section 35 (2) of the Act&quot; (c) A doctor who is a member of a partnership and whojoins the new service will lose the right to sell his existingshare in the partnership, except to an existing partner inpursuance of the partnership agreement. White the variousrights (whether in the form of options or obligations) to buy a further share in the partnership, which exist under thetypical partnership agreement, will continue, he will not beable to sell those rights. All these matters will have to betaken into consideration in fixing as between partners theirrespective shares of the compensation attributable to the partnership practice, and provision for this will be made inthe Regulations under Section 36 (3).&quot;17. This official interpretation means that all partner-ship agreements in existence on the appointed day retain their full validity. Is the Ministry interpretation right?This was the question the Negotiating Committee sub-mitted to an eminent Chancery Counsel, who found himself able to express an opinion, to use his own-words,only &quot; after long suspense of judgment and fluctuationsof view.&quot; His first conclusion was that on balance (he regarded it as a &quot; fifty-fifty &quot; affair) the Ministry inter-pretation should prevail. His opinions have been con-veyed to the Ministry. What follows in paragraphs18-27 is on the assumption that the Ministry interpfeta-tion of Sections 35 and 36 is right.18. Acceptance of the Ministry&apos;s interpretation,however, gives rise to two main difficulties:(a) It is impossible to determine, in advance of thevarious contingencies which may arise under the usualpartnership deed, the amount of compensation &quot; pay-able to any medical practitioner.&quot; Even if it beassumed that the amount of compensation due to a
partnership can be calculated it is impossible to calculate the shares of the individual partners.(b) It is impossible to determine at the appointed day how and to whom interest due on the compensa-tion monies should be paid.19. It is necessary to examine some implications ofthe Section, on the Ministry&apos;s interpretation. Wherepractitioners A and B are bound by a partnership deedwhich contains the usual mutual options or obligations to buy the share of a retiring or deceased partner, thecompensation due to each partner cannot be determineduntil it is.known who dies or retires first. It is impos-sible to assess in advance the cash value of the variousoptions and liabilities. The amount of compensationdue to a practice can be estimated, but, in the case ofa partnership, the division of the amount of compensa-tion is impossible until certain events have in fact hap-happened. In the meantime it will not be known in whatproportions to divide between the partners the interest which the Government has promised to pay between theappointed day and the liquidation of the compensationsum.20. It has been suggested that this difficulty could be overcome where both (or all) members of a partnershipenter the -new service:(a) by regarding the partnership as one practice forthe purpose of calculating compensation, and(6) by arranging, when subsequent transfers of shares are made between the partners, for the com-pensation to &quot; follow the share.&quot;Thus where a continuing partner A is required to buy the share of his retiring partner B (in. say, five years&apos;time) the compensation apportioned to B&apos;s share willbe transferred to A. Having received A&apos;s purchase money, B would have suffered no loss by reason ofbeing unable to sell his share in the practice and wouldnot, therefore, be entitled to compensation under theAct. A, who cannot resell, has suffered the whole ofthe loss sustained by the partnership and would receivethe whole of the compensation. C, whom A bringsinto the practice to help him in B&apos;s place, will losenothing because he will pay nothing on entering thepractice.21. There are at least two objections:(a) Though compensation may &quot;follow&quot; a shareof the practice when it is sold, such compensation mayor may not be equal to the sum paid by the purchaserfor something which he cannot subsequently sell. Apractitioner buys something at one price, but its value,when he comes to be paid the compensation due, maybe a lower or a higher price, probably a lower price.(b) The Act requires that interest should be paidannually from the appointed day until the time whenthe compensation sum is paid. Under Section 36(3) (d) the interest is to be paid &quot; on the compensation payable to any medical practitioner,&quot; that is, to thepractitioner entitled to the compensation. If interestwere apportioned and paid on the basis of the partner-ship snares as they exist on the appointed day, apartner who in, say, five years&apos; time fulfils an obliga-tion to buy an additional share in the partnershipwould lose the interest paid over those five years onthe compensation due in respect of that share of the partnership. On the other hand, the seller wouldhave received during those five years the interest ona compensation sum to which he is not entitled, in sofar as the Act has not prejudiced his right to selland, in fact, has not precluded him from sell!He will have received interest on a compensation which is going to be paid, not to himself, but toman who has bought nim out In brief, the buhas bought something which the Act precludes 1from selling but has lost some of the interest the compensation which the Act provides in resjof that prohibition. The seller has received into on a capital sum to which he is not entitled.o 22. *The Ministry contends that the position issame whether all or any of the partners join the iservice. This is inaccurate. For example:(i) Consider the case of practitioners A and B in partship, with B under an obligation to purchase A&apos;s snareA&apos;s death or retirement. Assume that A enters the senbut B does not The medical profession has been promthat its members will be free to enter or not to enter service. B, exercising this right, decides not to enter service. In due course A retires and B is required to pchase his share. B, having no alternative, purchasesshare, only to find that he cannot enjoy the income frthe public general practice which he has purchased withentering the service. But on entering the service he forfthe right to dispose of both his own share and the sharehas just purchased from A. He sacrifices these rights withcompensation, for there can be no compensation to a pntioner who joins the service after the appointed day. committee does not believe that Parliament contemplathat the Act would have this effect of expropriation. It nbe that the practitioner desiring to remain outside the senwill, in self-protection, be forced into the service. This wobe a breach of the promise given during the Second Readof the Bill that the profession is free to enter or not to enthe service viz.:The Bill places no obligation on any medical prattioner. He may stay outside the service altogether ifwishes to do so. (Hansard, May 1, 1946, Col. 220.)The Committee asks the Minister whether he propoto leave the position where it is.(ii) Another situation arises if B retires or dies first aA is required to purchase B&apos;s share. Having done so,is precluded from disposing of that share because he ismember of the service. Having joined the service on tappointed day he is entitled to compensation in respecthis own share of the practice, but he is left bound to buyshare which he cannot sell and for which there is no coipensation. The Ministers representatives have stated tlthey are advised it is lawful to give compensation to a prattioner in partnership, not merely in respect of the shareholds on the appointed day but in respect of a further shawhich he subsequently lawfully acquires in pursuance of tpartnership agreement On the contrary, the Committeeadvised that the Act provides for compensation onlyrespect of the goodwill a practitioner owns on the appointday. But even if the Minister&apos;! advisers are correct thereno element in the global sum of  66,000,000. or the &quot; apptpriate proportion&quot; thereof, for this compensation, for tlamount will, under the Act be calculated in proportion to tnumber of practitioners who actually join the service onbefore the appointed day. Compensation in respect ofshare purchased from a partner outside the service couldprovided from the global sum only at the expense of tpractitioners within the service. To provide fresh monwould involve new legislation.23. There is a further complication of a tecfiniicharacter.  66,000,000 or some proportion of it is tglobal sum for compensation purposes. Hitherto it hbeen contemplated that when all the claims have bemade, steps will be taken to calculate the amountcompensation due in respect of each practice brouginto the service. This is on the assumption that twhole of the global sum is to be distributed. But teffect of the Act is to leave an undistributable re$idin the compensation fund. The Act requires that theshall be paid out in compensation the sum of  66,000,0or an appropriate proportion thereof, this proportibeing calculated on a formula laid down in the /relating the amount to the number of practitioners w
(fact enter the service. For an amount of moneypnain undistributed would be in conflict withon 36 (2) of the Act. For example, if practitionerjjng in the service, is bought out under an existinguent by practitioner B not in the service, practi-t A, having been paid in full, loses his claim on(compensation fund. The amount which, on theioted day, was set aside for his compensation canjger go to him or to anyone else and interest onunount will have been improperly paid. It isjible to calculate in advance what the size of thisje will be. Accordingly, it is impossible finallyfculate the amount to be allocated to any individual$oner in compensation until the death or retire-of the last practitioner in partnership who joinsservice. Being unable to calculate the amounts ofpnsation, the Government is unable to calculateappropriate amounts of interest which it is requireday each year to individual practitioners.[Furthermore, if every principal entered the service,tr of his own free will or because of this pressure of act, the number of principals would be in excessie figure of 17,900 used in the calculation of the(100,000. The Governments advisers calculatednumber, it will be recalled, on the assumption thats principals remained outside the service. If everyopal entered the service the sum of  66,000,000Id, apart from all other considerations, be inadequatetheir compensation.5. The Negotiating Committee has been promised1 wherever a principal entering the service on theDinted day can demonstrate that he has sufferedriship in respect of a debt incurred in the purchaseilis practice, he will receive immediate payment ofcompensation to which he is entided. It will bejossible to give effect to this promise because, forsons already adduced, it it impossible accurately toess at the appointed day the amounts of compensa-idue either to individual practices or to individualttitioners.!6. To sum up, the consequences of the Ministryapretation of Sections 35 and 36 of the Act in theirsrat form include:(i) Existing agreements, with all their options andabilities, financial and other, remain legally validlespite the fact that they were designed to meet entirelyAfferent circumstances.! (ii) As a result, an individual practitioner may berequired to pay out a sum of money to purchase a share,lie compensation value of which is less than the amountbe has paid.1 Cut) As it is impossible to estimate in terms of moneythe various rights, obligations, and options in typicalpartnership agreements, it Is also impossible to estimatea the appointed day die shares due to individual partners.His being so, it is impossible to carry out the require-cent of the Act that interest should be paid annually to dividual practitioners.j (iv) In fulfilling his contractual obligations under apartnership deed a practitioner may be required(a) to buy a partners public practice die capitalI value of which he cannot realize, the income fromwhich he cannot receive, and compensation for whichI is not available to him; ori (b) to buy a partners private practice which he can-not sell and in respect of which no compensation is payable from the monies provided under the ActIt appears likely that the assumption hitherto made that it will be possible to estimate the shares of individualpractices (as distinct from individual practitioners) is un-fourided, as the Act requires, in theory, that the wholeof the  66,000,009, or the appropriate proportion thereof,shall be paid out and, in practice, there will be an un-distributable residue. The Government cannot keep itspromise in regard to the relief of hardship, and at thesame time put into operation the Act in its present form.(vi) In the Committee^ view, Sections 35 and 36 ofthe Act in their present form are unworkable. Theofficial interpretation is doubtful because of the ambitious-guity of the phraseology used, and, even if it be accepted,unfairness amounting in some cases to expropriation willresult27. The preceding paragraphs have been written onthe assumption that the Ministry interpretation ofSection 35 in relation to pre-existing partnership deedsis correct The doubts expressed on this point byChancery Counsel of the highest eminence have alreadybeen mentioned. Counsel has used these words: &quot; I still have very grave doubts as to the true construction ofSection 35 which, unless made clear, will in my opinionreflect no credit on its authors.&quot; Because of the obviousdoubts in the mind of Counsel, a further legal opinion was sought jointly from Sir Cyril Radcliffe, K.C., andMr. J. H. Stamp. After the fullest consideration, theyhave both reached the conclusion that the Ministryinterpretation of Sections 35 and 36 is wrong. Theirreasoned opinion&apos; will be conveyed to the Ministry assoon as it is received.It is submitted that a grave injustice would be done if this situation is allowed to remain. An authoritative-tive opinion can only be given by the House of Lords,and while it is recognized that this is true of any legisla-tios, the essential feature in this case is that it is knownnow that ambiguity exists, giving rise to the situation that no medical practitioner, even after consulting hissolicitor and counsel, can be certain of his position.Moreover, the question can only be brought before theHouse of Lords at the expense of some individual medi-cal practitioners in an action at law. Setting aside thearguments which have been raised earlier in this memo-randum as to the inequity flowing from the Ministryinterpretation, it is strongly urged that in any case theAct should be amended to remove the ambiguities.Indeed, individual members of the medical professionhave a right to know before the appointed day how theAct will affect them. It is unjust to leave a demon-strably ambiguous Act unamended and their ownfinancial position uncertain until a case has been foughtout in the Courts. Doctors who do not join the service by the appointed day will not qualify for compensation.For this reason alone they need to have the positionprecisely defined at least six months before the appointed day.They must know beyond all reasonable doubt whetherexisting partnership agreements remain in force or notThe- Ministry says they do and the highest legal opinionavailable says they -do not Where do partners stand?Are all existing agreements rendered null and void, withall the consequences which flow from such an extra-ordinary position?The Act has nothing to say about the validity, afterthe appointed day, of existing partnership agreements.If learned Counsel are right, a practitioner who, beingbound by an existing agreement to buy or sell a share,carries out his obligation, will be liable to fine or imprisonment.or both.  Such a situation is intolerable.This opinion is being published in the British Medical Journal.S
Partnerships after the Appointed Day28. In partnerships formed after the appointed daybetween practitioners involving a practice in the publicservice it will be illegal for the partners to distributethe emoluments of the practice except in the propor-tion in which they are earned. In the terminology ofthe Act there is deemed to have been a sale of good-will &quot; where in pursuance of any partnership agreementbetween medical practitioners services are performed byany partner for a consideration substantially less thanthose services might reasonably have been expected tobe worm having regard to the circumstances at the timewhen the agreement was made.&quot;Even if the argument be admitted and it is based on no more than a Ministry interpretation of the Act thatthe &quot; worth &quot; of a partner could be assessed not only on services rendered but also on his seniority and experi-ence, it is impossible to assess what the experience ofthe senior partner &quot; might reasonably have been expectedto have been worth.&quot; It is equally difficult to assess the anticipated value of the services of a junior partner atthe time when the agreement is made. In any case, therespective &quot; values of junior and senior partners maychange materially over the years. The general effect will be to discourage senior partners from taking juniorpartners. It illustrates that the Act seeks to destroy theindestructible, for whatever legislation may be passed the successful practitioner possesses something of value in the goodwill of his practice.29. It is ironical that an Act which purports to encouragement-age the development of group practice should in its operation have precisely the opposite eSect that ofdiscouraging practitioners from entering into partner-ship one with another, whether inside or outside health centres.30. It is a curious and presumably unforeseenanomaly arising from the Ministry interpretation that,should practitioners after the appointed day but before their entry into the service enter into a partnership deedinvolving buying or selling, that deed will still be binding on the participating practitioners.Assistants31. It is highly desirable that newly qualified prac-.practitioners seeking to enter the field of general practiceshould, for a period, act as assistants to practitionerswhose names are on the lists of Executive Councils, soas to gain the necessary experience. A practitioner whoemploys an assistant at remuneration &quot; substantially lessthan his services might reasonably have been expectedto be worth having regard to the circumstances at thetime when the remuneration was fixed &quot; and who subse-quently admits the assistant to partnership commits an offence. The effect of this will be to discourage practi-practitioners from admitting assistants to partnerships andto encourage them to employ assistants for short termswithout the prospect or possibility of partnership. add to this the diminished incentive to become an assistantbecause by application one may succeed in acquiringan independent practice and it appears the prospect ofthere being sufficient assistants will become remote. Theeffect will be that more and more practices will be left with no one in charge when a principal dies or retires.The Doctors House32. The widow of a practitioner who has worked inthe service is precluded from selling the house to anotherpractitioner with the knowledge that it will be used for&quot;practice purposes, if the purchase price is &quot; substantially in excess&quot; of the price which might reasonably hSbeen expected if the premises had not previously bfHused frw practice purposes.The effect of this may be, firstly, to penalize 9widow by leading her to accept a price which is flthan the real value of her property ; secondly, to runrisk of prosecution by putting up the house for aucticor, thirdly, to lead her to sell to a third party who \offer it at a higher price to the incoming practitionor, fourthly, she may sell it outside the medical ftentirely, so making medical practice in the area mdifficult.Many premises have been adapted structurallyprofessional use and in these cases it will be impossito assess the price &quot; which might reasonably hayc beexpected if the premises had not previously been ufor practice purposes.&quot;33. It may be argued that the system of registratiof agreements with the Medical Practices Committee vprotect the profession and the public from the dangreferred to in the foregoing paragraphs, although itdifficult to see how the widow could be afforded pitection.   But nothing is now known, or can yet known, by the Ministry or the profession, of the attude which may be adopted by any Medical PractkCommittee.  Such a committee will have no alternatibut to interpret the sections of the Act as passedParliament. However much it may desire to do nothito endanger partnerships and assistantships or to *danger practitioners, it cannot act except in conformiwith the definitions set out in the Statute.Remuneration34. The Committee asks that the Minister will iumake clear his attitude on the subject of remunertion.  The subject is not dealt with in the Act.  TCommittee is aware of the Ministers acceptanceprinciple of the majority recommendations of the SpeCommittee. It would now be grateful for the Minister]views on the translation of those recommendations inlterms of actual remuneration.   It is the Committee]view that, except where special circumstances jusulit, the remuneration of general practitioners should nby capitation payment in proportion to the number Apersons on a doctors list, and that this principle, whic]it regards as fundamental, should be embodied in thAct. It is opposed to the payment generally of a salarjbasic or other, considering that in ordinary circunjstances the general practitioner should be paid hcapitation fee.   The time has now come for a cleaand detailed statement on the whole subject.    ThMinister will recall the statement of the Lord Chancelloin the House of Lords on Oct. 28, 1946, replying tan argument that the terms and conditions of servicshould be made known to the profession well before thappointed day, that &quot; the Minister agrees that we ouglto aim at a period of six months so that the doctoican have ample time to make up their minds aswhether they are going to come in or not.!Right of Appeal to the Courts35. The view is widely held in the medical professithat there should be a right of appeal by the practitionaffected to the Courts of Law from any decision the tribunal to remove a practitioners name fromlists of any or all Executive Councils or, alternativelthat there should be a right of appeal from any advdecision of the Minister on this point.  In the HealService Bill for Northern Ireland a practitioner aggriev
. oecision of the tribunal is given the right ofto the Supreme CourtAs the seventh Schedule now stands, the medicaljof the tribunal will act in all cases in whichse of a medical practitioner is considered by that only if he is unable to act will it be possible[Minister Jo appoint a deputy. This position satisfactory. It is highly desirable that the case of anjal medical practitioner should be adjudicatedby a tribunal containing a practitioner familiar(type of practice and the type of area from whichjs. An amendment of the Schedule would bejyto make this possible.Hflie criteria for the statutory qualifications toj medicine, surgery, and midwifery are similaraland and Wales, in Scodand, and in Northern[ The right to participate in the midwifery ser-provide as part of the National Health Service inid and Northern Ireland is accorded to all prac-rs by virtue of their statutory medical quaufica-iut in England and Wales the Minister has takento restrict that right by imposing a qualificationmal to the statutory qualification. This is incon-. unnecessary, and undesirable.Ft POINTSaaoship of Local Executive CouncilThis body should enjoy the right of appointing a chairman from among its own members, pro-lal or lay, or from outside, just as insuranceittees appoint their own chairmen to-day. Eveni accepted as a matter of convenience that thesr should appoint the chairman for a preliminarythere is no case for continuing to deprive thetee of the right to appoint its own chairman,ach preliminary period should be of short dura-[To effect this change, amendment of the Act isry.talion with Local Units of the ProfessionSo far as general medical, dental, and pharma-il services are concerned, the responsible localnamely the Executive Council, in exercising itsins under Part IV of the Act, is required toIt with local committees representative of the pro-is concerned.  The Act does not impose a cbrre-ing measure of consultation in the case of thelal Boards and the Local Health Authorities. Theial Hospital Board, in preparing its scheme forcal administration of hospital and specialist ser-is not required by the Act to consult the localal profession.   The Local Health Authority, iningits scheme for carrying out the duties imposed!tHI of the Act, is not required by the Act totthe local medical profession, though it is requiredi a copy of its proposals to the Regional Hospital. the Governors of any Teaching Hospital in the Executive Council, other Local Authorities ina,and &quot;to every voluntary organization which toWedge of the Local Health Authority providesffihrea of die Authority services of the kind dealtIpthe proposals.&quot; This means, for example, thatwhich is charged with the duty of providing,HPg, and maintaining Health Centres where (interHperal medical services will be provided is notflN to consult the local medical profession by whomMpivices will be provided.    Such consultationspP be provided for as a requirement in the act the local executive council is not required to consult the local medical committee in all appropriate matterscoming before it but only &quot; on such occasions and tosuch extent as may be prescribed.&quot; This limitation isregarded as unsatisfactory.Scope and Conditions of Service40. (a) In general, and subject to what is recommendedbelow, the definition of the scope of the general practi-petitioner service should follow the lines of the existingdefinition of the obligations under the National HealthInsurance ActAnaesthetics(b) The administration of anaesthetics in midwiferyand dental cases should be excluded from the practi-petitioner&apos;s obligations.(c) The administration of other anaesthetics for patients on the list of the practitioner concerned shouldbe within the terms of service only if:(1) the operation is of a kind which is usually per-formed by, and is in fact performed by. a general medical practitioner, and(2) the administration of the anaesthetic or theother assistance rendered does not involve a degreeof special skill or experience not possessed by general practitioners as a class.Emergency Attendances(d) The following procedure should govern emergencyattendances:A. Public Service Patients on Practitioners&apos; Lists:(i) That a public service practitioner should be under an obligation to make deputizing arrange-ments to the satisfaction of the Executive Counciland the Local Medical Committee.(ii) That in an emergency the public service prac-titioner could properly be under an obligation toattend a public service patient not on his list, wherethe patient has tried unsuccessfully to obtain theservices of his own doctor or his deputy; or wherethe doctor is satisfied that such is the grave natureof the emergency that the calling in of the nearestavailable doctor is justified.B. Patients not on Practitioners&apos; Lists:Where emergency treatment is rendered to a patientwhose name is not on the list of any practitioner inthe service:(i) the patient may if he so desires and if he isresident in the area of the doctor*s practice ask tohave his name included in the list of the practi-petitioner rendering the treatment. Where the patientdoes not reside in the area of the practice he mayexpress a desire to be treated as a public servicepatient. In the circumstances here indicated ncfee should be payable by the patient for the emer-gency treatment(ii) the patient may if he so desires elect to betreated as a private patient.C. Practitioners Fee for Attendance in Emergencies:Where a public service practitioner attends in anemergency he should be entitled, on making appli-cation, to a fee from the service for his attendance.Practitioners&apos; Lists(e) (i) A practitioner entering the service should retainhis present National Health Insurance list.
(ii) the objective should be a maximum of 4,000public patients per practitioner.Certification(/) The requirement is imposed by Section 33 (2) (d)of the Act to issue certificates &quot;for the purposes ofany enactment,&quot; which includes the purposes of regu-lations made under any enactment. The Committee^view is that the practitioners obligation should be limitedto certificates under the National Health Service andthe National Insurance Acts, 1946. Although it wel-comes the establishment of a committee to examine thewhole position of certification, the burden of certificationis bound to be oppressive while Section 33 (2) (d) of theAct remains in its present form.Health Centres(g) (i) The Central Health Services Council should appoint a Standing Advisory Committee on health centres; the establishment of these Centres should pro-ceed experimentally and under central control.(ii) No practitioner should be compelled to undertakeservice at a Health Centre.(in) The Medical Committee of the Centre, includingits chairman, should have an appropriate status in rela-tion to (a) the administrative arrangements of the Centre,and (b) the making of appointments of persons (e.g.,nurses) employed at the Centre. In general, the respon-sibility for the arrangements at the Centre so far as theserelate to general medical services should rest with theMedical Committee.Assistants(h) (i) It is highly desirable that newly qualified prac-practitioners seeking to enter the field of general practiceshould, for a period, act as assistants to practitionerswhose names are on the lists of Executive Councils soas to gain the necessary experience.(ii) There should be no legal requirement to prohibita newly qualified practitioner from having his nameincluded, for the purposes of independent practice, onsuch lists.(in) It should be permissible for an agreement to berequired by a principal from an assistant which wouldprohibit him, on leaving the practice of the pri:from having his name entered on the local list injpetition with the practitioner for whom he hasfworking.Collective Responsibility41. On and after the appointed day a proportflthe population will sign on doctors&apos; lists.   Of mmainder, a proportion, varying in different area;sign on doctors&apos; lists when the need arises to ia doctor.  A third group will consist of personJdo not intend to use the service and adhere tointentions.The Committee has considered the possibuSlimiting the obligation of public service practitSto those persons who have in fact signed on dd-lists.  It soon became obvious that it would be isible so to limit this obligation, bearing in mind ti-any time, including the beginning of an illne:individual may decide to use the service.Thus an obligation will exist to attend two ithree groups described above, those who have isigned on doctors&apos; lists and those who will at future date. Indeed, as any member of the corningcan at any time call a doctor, and at the outset iconsultation request to be accepted as a public sefpatient, there does exist a responsibility relating twhole community. Id any case, it is clear that fdfirst two groups that responsibility will exist fronjbeginning.With this in mind, collective responsibility fogreat majority of the community will exist, and essential that this should find expression in a a fund, made up of the total number of persons estitto be at risk multiplied by the agreed capitatiotThe two things necessarily go together collresponsibility and a central fund.There should be established a central practitijfund equal to the capitation fee agreed upon multjby a number equal to a high percentage of the peltion, this percentage being less but only slightly!than 100. The allocation of the central practitilfund would be the responsibility of a Distribution fmittee analogous to the one now in existence fojpurposes of National Health Insurance.HOSPITAL AND SPECIALIST SERVICESTransfer of Hospitals42. In its present form the Act makes possible a statemonopoly of hospitals. To the Minister are transferredon the appointed day all voluntary and. council hospitality-hospitals, the definition of voluntary hospital covering anyinstitution for the reception and treatment of persons suffering from illness of any kind, including associatedclinics, dispensaries, and out-patient departments, suchinstitutions not being carried on for profit So wide a definition may cover not only institutions generally re-garded as voluntary and public hospitals but a numberof institutions hitherto regarded as, and sometimescalled, nursing homes. There is no assurance either that such private accommodation as is taken over willcontinue to be used for that purpose, or that privateaccommodation will be retained or developed accordingto the public demand for such accommodation. quite apart from this automatic transfer the Minister is given power to acquire by compulsory purchase any institu-tion not so taken over, even though it may be conductedprivately on a profit-making or dividend-paying basis.The Committee asks that the position of private jing homes should be clarified by excluding such Itutions, whether carried on for profit or not, froadefinitions of hospital and clinic set out in Sectioj10, and 79 of the Act.43. State ownership of nursing homes is in no!essential to the efficiency of the service. It would!to deprive the profession of facilities for indepejpractice. The continuance of independent practlnecessary to the maintenance of a high standalmedical service. If this is to be ensured, a Milshould neither take over automatically existing ndjhomes, nor have power to acquire either those nilhomes which are in existence or those which may^up in the future.44. It is the two situations the automatic traand the power to acquire regarded together,arouse the fear that a Minister, present or futureestablish a monopoly in hospitals by compulacquiring, or threatening so to do, any private or vtary hospital, home, dispensary, or clinic establish
pre. The Committee believes on grounds of public.y that a Minister should not be so enabled andfjeted to establish a monopoly, but rather thatjjjs should be provided to enable private establish-3 to be carried on outside the service, whether on$or non-profit basis.; Under Section 6 (3) of the Act the Minister isjjaed, if it appears to him that the transfer of ajjjjr hospital is unnecessary, to &quot; disclaim &quot; suchfM, subject to the right of the governing bodyjjea notice on the Minister stating that they wishhospital to be taken over. The Committee asksjj early announcement should be made of the hos-, which the Minister proposes to exempt fromfer under this section. In the Committee&apos;s viewujjster himself should determine the principles tojplied by regional boards in considering the exemp-i individual hospitals.jsl Accommodation for Private Patients, Under Section 5 (2) the Minister may allow anyioner serving on the staff of a hospital to treatprivate patients at that hospital or at any othertal. In the Committee&apos;s view the Ministers dis-m should be replaced by an obligation to permitalists in the service to attend their patients in privateU accommodation.It is common practice to-day to allocate a pro-Ion of private rooms to patients of moderate incomej pay fees, professional and other, in proportion toI income or to the type of room selected. It is desir-jand necessary in the interests of those who pay lessfi the cost that there should be low ceilings to thegs of fees charged for such facilities. Maximumfes appropriate to such patients, however, wouldpholly inappropriate to those who pay the full costsfad. In at least a proportion of such private beds,Igements between specialist and patient should bep into privately and should not be subject toSol by regulation.I Section 4, authorizing the Minister to make anypie accommodation in single rooms or small wardsfable for patients who agree to pay for the accom-jation  charges covering part of the cost, may makeanally impossible for specialists to undertake privatelice. Such patients will enjoy private accommoda-, paying an additional sum, in the terminology offltt, only &quot; for such accommodation.&quot; During theKing Committee debate, the Minister, in reply toption whether medical fees could be recovered fromsas who pay for special accommodation underf 4, stated:P, Medical fees could be recovered in certainstances because it might be possible that inlospitals there would be no pay block. . . .&quot;committee asks the Minister to reaffirm thispent, and to secure the necessary amendment of w 4 to enable it to be given effect. For professionalfence there should be a sliding scale of fees vary-ccording to the circumstances of the patient, thebeing determined by the hospital management com-b with, the approval of the regional board. By so  as separate rooms are set aside to provide accom-tion under Section 4 for patients not paying pro-nal fees by so much will specialists be deprivedralities for independent practice and by so muchJtients of moderate means be deprived of facilitiesPtaining private treatment which they now enjoy.Hospital services should be planned so that all classesof the community may obtain the accommodation they desire. Patients should not be deprived of the oppor-tunities which they now enjoy of arranging to be treatedas private personal patients.49. Implicit in the provision authorized by Section 4is the principle of grant-in-aid, the patient paying onlythe additional cost in respect of the accommodation.In the Ccmmittee&apos;s view the same principle should beextended to patients who pay the full cost of privatetreatment in the private accommodation referred to inSection 5 of the ActSO. Where the professional services of a radiologistor pathologist are required for a patient occupying aprivate ward, the radiologist or pathologist should re-ceive a fee for bis services in the same way as any otherspecialistMethod of Reference of Patients to Specialists51. The Committee accepts the general principle thatthe National Health Service should provide a fullspecialist service. In its view there should not be con-ferred on the patient the right to consult a particularspecialist. It considers that:(a) Patients should be referred to specialists only at the request of a general practitioner;(b) It is desirable that a written communication from the general practitioner should accompany the patient;(c) Facilities for diagnosis should be made directlyavailable to general practitioners, whether in hospital or elsewhere.Appointment of Specialists52. Appointments in non-teaching hospitals at levelscorresponding to those of the present honorary staffswill be made by Regional Hospital Boards on the advice of Advisory Appointments Committees. It is under-stood that appointments to the junior staff up to and including the registrar level will be made by hospital management committees with formal approval by the regional board. There should be an early announce-ment of the precise constitution of advisory appoint-ments committees. The Committee stresses the need fora close liaison between teaching and non-teaching hos-hospitals and considers that, so far as the appointment ofspecialists is concerned, there should be representation on the advisory appointments committee both of thehospital management committee and the university con-cerned, with provision for the attendance as observersof external assessors. The Committee recognizes that though it is desirable, it might be impracticable to havea common advisory appointments committee selectingcandidates for both teaching and non-teaching hospitals.General Terms of Service53. The Committee recognizes that any decision onspecialist remuneration must await the report of theSpens Committee. In regard to the mode of remunera-tion, it recommends:(a) that for hospital work remuneration should beby annual payments generally related to status, re-&apos;  sponsibuity, and estimated total time spent in theservice, and possibly also to length of service;(b) that for domiciliary work remuneration shouldbe on the item-of-service basis and that specialistsshould be free to determine whether or not they win
Undertake an obligation (of domiciliary work underthe service.Appointments for domiciliary visits should be madeby the hospital concerned on the application of ageneral practitioner. Each hospital should keep alist of specialists undertaking domiciliary work, in-cluding days and hours at which they will be avail-able; Except in emergency patients should be per-mitted to consult the specialist of their choice, flto his availability.Boards of Governors of Teaching Hospitals;Management Committees Chairman54. The Committee considers that, after the!appointments, boards of governors of teaching hqand hospital management committees should &quot;mitted to appoint their own chairman.LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITY SERVICESStatutory Health Committees55. The Act requires each local health authority toappoint a health committee and that a majority of themembers shall be members of the authority. The Com-mittee&apos;s view is that local health authorities should berequired to co-opt to the health committee medical practitioners representative of the local profession. Ina circular to the authorities the Minister, while notaccepting the view that - these authorities should berequired to co-opt medical representatives, has emphasised-sized the importance of the inclusion on health-com-mittees of proper representation of the profession.The Committee has collected information on theextent to which these powers of co-option have been exercised from 42 of the 62 county councils arid 57 ofthe 83 county borough councils. Of the 99 authoritiesin respect of which information is available 94 have -opted a total of 138 members of the profession, and five authorities have decided not to co-opt medical practitioners.Remuneration56. The Committee attaches importance to theprinciple that the remuneration and conditions ofservice of all medical officers employed by localauthorities (including those which are not local!authorities within the meaning of the Act) shotnegotiated at the same time and through themachinery.Decentralization of Local Health Authority Servic57. In county areas the Minister has advisiauthorities that the best method of organizing the \administration of the services enumerated !u Panthe Act is by the subdivision of the county intchealth areas, with a subcommittee of the county]committee exercising delegated functions for eacfSuch local, subdivisions will be based on the ,health considerations of the locality rather than ]areas already determined for the purposes of divadministration under the Education Act 1944.Where such schemes of delegation result in idistrict medical officers of health losing the majtof their present work there-should be adequate ccsation for loss or partial loss of office. In themittee&apos;s view it ought to be made possible fomedical officers to claim and receive compensatelieu of accepting new posts offered by a county imerely with a view to finding them work witho;of salary.MENTAL HEALTH SERVICESDivision of Responsibility58. The Committee is anxious about the division ofresponsibility for the mental health services betweenregional hospital boards and local health authorities,and wishes to stress the importance of securing a closeliaison between specialist psychiatrists working in thesetwo fields. There should be available to local health authorities the services of a practitioner of specialiststanding in psychiatry and mental deficiency. local health authorities might be grouped to employ such anadviser and encouraged to make &quot; Joint User&apos; ...ments in consultation with regional or teaching-hfboards.Regional Psychiatrists59. The Committee attaches considerable impto the appointment of regional psychiatrist It isizes that the remuneration attaching to these!should be of an order sufficient to attract psychof      highest ability.SUPERANNUATION60. The Committee regards as unsatisfactory the omission from the Superannuation Scheme of:(a) Provision for &quot; added years &quot; to compensate forthe long period of training before medical qualifica-tion and the relatively late age of entry to the service.(6) Some form, of immediate cover (whether by&quot;added years&quot; or the reckoning of non-contributingservice) against permanent incapacity or death in theearly years of service. This applies particularly topractitioners who are 55 years of age or. more on theappointed day. -6!. So far as the profession is concerned,posals for widows&apos; pensions are inadequate,minimum of one-third is too low. especially inthe substantial reductions that may be made &apos;where the widow is younger than her husband.62. Consideration should be given to the deof extending the. Scheme:(a) To include provision for the transfer ofjannuation rights for medical officers who transflthe local government service to the university f(fc) To include superannuation facilities fortaries and dispensers of practitioners who enservice.
IpRESENTATION OF THE PROFESSION ON ADMINISTRATIVE BODIESthe Minister, during the second reading debateHouse of Commons, expressed the view:In fact, the whole scheme provides a greater degreeprofessional representation than any other schemeive seen.&quot;-iHansard, Col. 52. April 30. 1946.)Committee does not share the Ministers view,jar from satisfied with the extent to which thehas appointed the profession^ nominees to thetil Hospital Boards.   For example, the british   Association nominated 85 members of the pro-for the 14 Regional Boards, an average of sixRegion. Only 27 of these nominees were appointedMinister.   In five Regions only one of the sixKjjoners nominated was appointed ; in five Regions-fthe six were appointed, and in the remaining fourjus three of the six were appointed by the Minister.Royal College of Surgeons nominated a total of31 practitioners, of whom seven were appointed by theMinister, including one who was also a B.M.A. nominee.At the time of this report the membership of theCentral Health Services Council has not been announced.So far as local health authority services are con-cerned, the extent to which county and county borough councils have exercised their powers of co-option to health committees has already been discussed under paragraph 55.The Committee desires to remind the Minister of his statement during the second reading debate:&quot;I believe that democracy exists in the active participation in administration and policy. There-fore I believe that it is a wise thing to give the doctors full participation in the administration oftheir own profession.&quot;POWERS OF THE minister the Act involves an excessive concentration ofin the hands of the Minister.  He will appointCentral Health Services Council and its committees,lippoints the Regional Hospital Boards which willgni appoint the hospital management committees,uill determine by Regulation a wide variety of including mode and amount of remuneration.Brill determine the issue of the continuance of apractitioner in the general medical service without aright of appeal to the Courts. The majority of Regu-lations the Minister makes will become law from themoment he makes them, subject only to their annul-ment by a Prayer in the House of Commons. He will deal with many important subjects by Orders which arenot subject to Parliamentary control.MAIN POINTS OF THE NEGOTIATING COMMITTEES CASEIn many respects the Act as it now stands is unaccept-to the medical profession. The main points whichmodification, in most cases by amendment of the Act,the approval of the majority of the profession1. DISTRIBUTIONDoctors should be free to determine without pressure,Kt or indirect, whether or not to enter the publicce. If they decide to enter the service they shouldfree to choose their area of practice.BUYING AND SELLING OF PRACTICESis in the best interests of the public and the profes-that general practitioners should retain the owner-of the goodwill of their practices. This ownershipirides an important incentive, encourages good and work, provides a basis for co-operation betweenIhctitioners and a bond between doctors and theirIpients.  Although in this document emphasis is laidunworkability of the Act in this regard the issueownership of goodwill is regarded by the medical pro-as fundamental to its freedom.3. REMUNERATIONRemuneration of general practitioners should be byl!?ilation payments in proportion to the number of per-on a doctor&apos;s list, except where special circum-justify some other method of payment, and the should be so amended to provide for this, as in theBwhern Ireland Bill. The Minister has accepted inBjuciple the majority recommendations of the SpensKwmiitee, and the profession asks for his views ontranslation of those recommendations into terms of hire remuneration.The remuneration of specialists for hospital work should be on the basis of animal payments and for domi-ciliary work should be on the item-of-service basis.4. RIGHT OF APPEAL TO COURTSThere should be a right of appeal to the High Courtagainst a decision to remove a practitioners name fromthe list(s) of any or all executive councils.5. MIDWIFERYIt is inconsistent, unnecessary, and undesirable thatthe Minister should seek to impose upon practitionersundertaking midwifery in England and Wales a qualifica-tion which is not imposed by the Medical Acts or uponpractitioners undertaking midwifery in Scotland andNorthern Ireland.6. ADMINISTRATIVE BODIESExecutive and other councils and committees set up under the Act should elect their own chairmen.7. PUBLIC HOSPITALSIt is undesirable that a Minister should be empoweredto establish a monopoly in hospitals. Private nursinghomes, whether carried on for profit or not, should be excluded from the definitions of hospital and clinic setout in Sections 9, 10, and 79 of die Act8. HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION for private PATIENTSThe Ministers discretion should be replaced by an obligation to permit specialists in the service to attendtheir patients in private hospital accommodation. Inat least a proportion of such private accommodation
arrangements between the specialist and the patientshonld not be subject to control by regulation.9. FACILITIES FOR DIAGNOSISFacilities for diagnosis, including radiological andpathological services, should be made directly availableto general practitioners, whether in hospital or elsewhere.10. STATUTORY HEALTH COMMITTEESLocal health authorities should be required to co-optto Health Committees medical practitioners represents-tive of the local profession.11. PUBLIC HEALTH service the remuneration and conditions of. service of allmedical officers employed by local authorities (including those which are not local health authorities) should be negotiated at the same lime and through the samemachinery.12. REPRESENTATION OF THE. PROFESSIONON ADMINISTRATIVE BODIESThere should be adequate representation of the medl-cal profession on administrative bodies concerned withParts H and IV of the Service, such representationbeing arranged by the Minister in agreement with, aswell as after consultation with, the appropriate medicalorganizations.POSTSCRIPT66. The Act as it stands is full of legal perpkxitisanomalies which could only be resolved, if at all, afteilonged litigation accompanied by widespread onceramong the profession and the public. Many of theprovisions are fraught with the risk of grave hards!patients and with serious injustice to doctors and dependants. Even with the utmost good will oa th;of the medical profession the wording of the Actplaces so obscure that to bring ft into force as it i will create chaotic conditions.

I THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE AND THEMEDICAL PROFESSION1RAL COMMENTS OF THE MINISTER, ADDRESSED TO THE INDIVIDUAL DOCTORMinisters memorandum on the Negotiating Com-$ statement about the National Health Servicej. The Secretary of State for Scotland associates[with the memorandum, which may therefore bes applicable (with the necessary changes) to the;in Scotland, so far as conditions in that countrytsame as in England and Wales,memorandum deals only with the points raisedt Committee. But, for the individual doctor,ire other simpler matters on which he wants toexactly where he stands. If he participates in theealth service, how does it affect him personally ?dly any major step to better social services (indoctors, above all, are interested) has provokedmis-statements or misunderstandings than them Health Service Act. The Minister would likee this opportunity, in preface to his main memo-m, of clearing some of the more fundamentalwhich must be exercising many doctors&apos; minds,i only deal with some of these in this paper but) others he wHl be glad to try to help doctors to stand what the scheme means to them, if they willtouch with his department.It are some of the points, mainly affecting theil practitioner.WHAT DOES TAKING PART MEAN ?Any doctor, like any other member of the public,larticipate in the new scheme or not or partly doIpartly not just as he thinks fit. There is noIsion whatever.\ny doctor participating can also retain privatee. This and other professional services for fees:r remuneration, other public or private medicalmay go on. The only limitation is that no fees: charged to patients whom he has accepted onwithin the scheme.&apos; Service &quot; is perhaps a misnomer if it is thoughtin organised corps, like the medical branches of lighting services. Nor is there any hierarchy ofKrvision&quot; or interference with a doctor&apos;s pro-pi judgment and clinical practice. He undertakesok after patients and is left to do so in his own wayb the best of his clinical ability.   He is not &quot; underHe is not&quot; employed.&quot; He enters into an arrange-witha Local Executive Council (half professional,irs, dentists and chemists) which takes the place of id Insurance Committee and, in essence, his con-is to look after the patient whose care he undertakesi to be paid for it from public funds, in these cases,id of by private fee. He is certainly not a civilat.HOW WILL THE DOCTOR BE PAID?What is this payment from public funds? It isM in detail in paragraphs 26 and 27 of the mainPrandum attached. But examples of it can be% given here.Moctor takes on 4,000 potential patients under theshone, his gross income from this source would if his number is 3,000 potential patients, the*ome is nearly  2,600. In addition he may havefcfees from other patients, other public or privatepaid appointments, additional fees for undertakingmaternity work, mileage allowances, allowances fortraining assistants, and other extras.(6) Also there will be a fund of over  400,000 a yearavailable for discretionary payments as &quot; inducements &quot;to assist practice in difficult and unpopular areas.(7) The aim will be to set 4,000 as the maximum num-ber of patients for a doctor under the scheme, but thereis no rigidity in this.(8) All of this assumes that no less than 95 % of thepopulation use the new service. If the figure is less, thepayment per patient is proportionately higher. But, intwo years&apos; time, that position wiU be reviewed. It is the essence of a successful national service that both doctors and the Government co-operate in getting the nation asa whole to benefit by it.COMPENSATION AND SUPERANNUATION(9) Doctors who participate in the scheme on theappointed day will establish their claim to their share ofthe  66,000,000 which the Government has set aside ascompensation for their being unable in future to sellpublic practices. The sum of  66,000,000 represents anamount agreed with the profession^ representatives. TheMinister is prepared to take the profession^ own adviceas to how this is to be most equitably distributed.Normally, it will be payable when capital values would otherwise be realised on retirement or death with interest in the meantime. But, if there is hardship, likesome undue debt burden on the practice, it can be paid at once. If a doctor wants, later on, to stop practice for any reason he can draw his compensation at once and do so.(10) In addition, a superannuation scheme is to be started; the doctor contributing 6% of the payment he receives in the new service (less a percentage for &quot;practiceexpenses&quot;) and the Government 8%; the benefits toinclude a pension and a lump sum on retirement(including retirement on incapacity) a death benefit anda widow&apos;s pension.(11) The profession^ representatives think thatpartnership agreements will be prejudiced by the new arrangements. The Minister is advised otherwise, aswill be seen (see paragraphs 14 to 22 of the main memo-randum). But, if the Minister finds, on any judicialdecision, that he is wrong, he undertakes to introduce legislation to restore his original intentions, as indicatedin the main memorandum.NO DIRECTION OF DOCTORS(12) All existing doctors can participate in the new scheme where they are practising now. After the schemeis operating a doctor wishing to participate and drawpublic remuneration will need to get consent from amainly medical body to be set up. Private practice is,of course, unaffected. Consent in respect of. publicpractice will only be refused in those few areas wherethere is clearly no need for additional &quot; public &quot; practice.(This is dealt with more fully in paragraphs 6 to 13 of themain memorandum attached.) No doctor can be directedanywhere.(13) Under the old National Health Insurance scheme a doctor can be debarred by the Minister from con-tinuing to participate.   In future he can only be so
debarred by a special and statutory tribunal a lawyer(appointed by the Lord Chancellor) someone representingthe Executive Councils, and a doctor. If they do debarhim, he can still be retained by a successful appeal tothe Minister. If they decide he should remain, theMinister has no power to intervene. The advantage liesonly with the doctor.(14) Although a doctor may not get consent toopening a surgery for practice with the scheme in aparticular area (on the grounds that it is not needed) hecan accept patients from any area he wishes as long ashe is prepared to visit them as necessary.(15) As and when Health Centres are set up, no doctorwill be compelled to practise in them. Their object willbe to provide premises and equipment, usually costly forthe doctor to provide for himself, and to enable him the better to treat his patients. In Health Centres the personal relationship (of &quot; my doctor &quot;) will be retained.There is no question of setting up &quot; institutions &quot;wherethe patient has to see the doctor &quot; on duty.&quot; They willbe a substitute for the doctors home surgery, publiclyserviced and equipped. Group practice, like presentpartnerships, will be encouraged in them.ASSISTANTS(16) Assistants, paid by the doctor, will permit as before of enlarged lists of potential patients. In addi-tion there will be a system of grants to doctors for thetraining of young assistants still to be worked out indetail in consultation with the profession.DOCTORS IN THE RUNNING OF THESERVICE(17) Doctors are, for the first time, brought on asubstantial scale into every main field of administration ofthe new scheme Regional Hospital Boards, Boards of governors of Teaching Hospitals and Executive Coun-cils.

The Minister has studied the statement of the Negotiating Committee&apos;s views. He has also Discussion:main points in meetings with their representatives on 2nd and 3rd December, 1947, and the subject matteistatement has been discussed in greater detail earlier with his officers.2. The Minister now sets out his own views, following on the discussions, and in doing so follows tisubject headings as the statement for ease of reference.PRELIMINARY3. The Minister agrees with the account given of the events leading up to his discussions with the negotiating committee. He has never excluded and does not nowexclude the possibility of amending legislation being found desirable. Indeed, in his experience, it would be most unusual if points for amendment were not dis-covered sooner or later in any measure of the scope ofthe National Health Service Act. He expects this to beno exception. But the discussions have not convincedhim of any sufficient reason to go to Parliament and askit to alter its intentions as to the new service before that service has been tested in actual operation and foundto need amendment.   If, when the time comes, it is sofound, the Minister will not only be willing tolbut will himself be the first to wish to seek-its fcation and improvement by Parliament.4. Meanwhile, within the framework of the Min its administration, there is clearly room fojadjustments which result from discussion and wHthe purpose of discussion.

The Minister has again examined the seven general principles set out in the Committee&apos;s statement, \does not believe that anything;&apos;n the proposed National Health Service is reallv in conflict with them.2
GENERAL PRACTICEitionie decision of Parliament to assure all people thejnity to benefit from a full medical service ihe Committee approve in their statement i the placing of responsibility somewhere foreign the reasonable distribution and availability ofrvice. A public duty cannot be undertakenany reasonable means of fulfilling it. Publiccannot be attracted to practice in areas where theinterest does not warrant it. Even so, the Actitely avoids any power of &quot;direction&quot; of doctorsis is mentioned by the Negotiating Committee&apos;sslated principle). All existing doctors can takei the new arrangements where their practice lies,i disturbance. After that, and for the future,i reserved to the new health service the right onlyin what areas it has no need for additional partici-(replacements for its own purposes. This hassto do with, and does not affect, private practice,ior is it the Minister who will normally decide this,nainly medical body (the Medical Practices Com-I specially set up for the purpose and not subjectlirection. A doctor, having been refused participa-Ihe new service in a given area, can appeal to the:r; but it is a one-way appeal (for the doctor, andainst him); i.e., the Minister can reverse theittee&apos;s decision and turn it in the doctors favour,not reverse what the Committee have allowedrn the decision against the doctor. The &quot; worst &quot;; Minister can do, from the doctor&apos;s point of view,ihold a decision already reached by the professionalil Practices Committee.i the Ministers view, and the view endorsed bypent, this is the minimum public intervention inEI*tributiop. of a public service which could possiblylied to the country and the taxpayer when theuation, of a public undertaking to see that all:an get what they need, has come into being. Tond this would be, not a question of the right toprivately anywhere (which doctors will still be/ free to do), but a question of giving them thedemand publicly remunerated work where theyposition which no other profession or occupationpecially when there may not be enough doctorsneeds of all the population, it cannot, in ther&apos;s view, be assumed that payment in respect of practically all the people will result in an equalBation of doctors in relation to population.iNor will the procedure for obtaining consent tolein the public service in new areas be cumbersomelaborate, as the Negotiating Committee present it.medical Practices Committee will, as a matter of on sense, make it its job to keep in regular touchlocal Executive Councils (the successors to thenee Committees) and will know the areas whereino need for new public practice or replacement Be will be few, for many years to come, until theI of doctors available has increased.  Apart fromfas consent can usually be given automatically the question of two or more claimants for oneArises. In the latter cases involving selection andtation with the Executive Council, the Executiveilean find out the Local Medical Committee&apos;sid make its recommendations at the same timejttis in the names for selection.  There need be% and, even in selection cases, the period ofKnt should usually be nearer one month than four.RSiich interval as there is will be dealt with by regulations. If a doctor dies and his representativewants to appoint a &quot; locum &quot; to look after matterstemporarily, this can be authorised. Alternatively, theExecutive Council itself, consulting the Local MedicalCommittee, can appoint a locum and make such arrange-ments as are necessary (including arrangement for accommodation).12. On the point whether consent might be withheld from practice in a particular part of an area, this powerto deal with parts as well as whole areas is simply de-signed to meet the case where the need for refusal onlyarises in one part of what may be a large area such asLondon. It will not have the effect of stopping a patientfrom crossing some imaginary boundary line to consulta doctor (as the Negotiating Committee seem to think)because the Medical Practices Committee will be askedto make any such refusal only a refusal of consent tothe carrying on of surgeries or centres in a specified partof the area. Although the doctor may not get consent to the surgery in that area he can accept patients fromanywhere as long as he is prepared to visit them as maybe needed.13. On the whole of this question of consent to newparticipation in the service in new areas, it must be emphasised that the areas where this is likely to be foundunjustifiable and redundant are few. Also, the pictureis not one of a Medical Practices Committee going through an involved procedure in every individual case,as though it had each time to ascertain the situation ofan entirely strange area. It will be a body which existsto know the facts of the country generally, to keep up todate on them by contact with Executive Councils, andto know in short in which few areas it has to be spe-cially watchful. It will, therefore, be able to act quickly and, normally, from its own knowledge.Ownership of Goodwill : Existing Partnership Agree-ments14. The interpretation of the Act set out in paragraph16 of the Committee&apos;s memorandum correctly sets out what the Minister believes to be the effect of the Act(on all the legal advice which he has obtained) and alsowhat he understands Parliament to have intended in theAct. If there are varying opinions as to the validity ofthis interpretation, the Minister has no power to decideupon their merits ; that is for the Courts. If, in theevent, this interpretation is proved to be wrong, theMinister will unhesitatingly seek from Parliament suchcorrection of the Act as will be designed to restore it.He gives that assurance without question. All of thisis normal and familiar constitutional procedure. TheMinister, with Parliament^ endorsement, does what heis advised to be right in achieving his intentions. If andwhen that is proved to be wrong he asks Parliament to adjust it.15. The interpretation referred to means that the Actdoes not make it illegal to carry out, as between partners,existing partnership agreements. Existing powers orobligations between partners to buy or sell shares of the partnership practice will remain in force and can be fulfilled. Careful provision is necessary to secure thatthe right proportion of compensation goes eventually tothe practitioner who actually suffers the loss and that apractitioner whose share is bought by his partner doesnot get both the purchase money and the compensation.The methods by which it is proposed to deal with theproblem are set out in paragraphs 17 to 22 below, andthe Minister considers that provision by regulations onthese lines will dispose of all the major difficulties, whichit is his firm intention to do.&apos;
16. But suppose that his advice is wrong. It is alwayswithin the power of any partners, if they still feel that in exceptional cases some anomaly is left which is not and cannot be covered by any general provision, to vary byagreement the terms of the partnership and so to remove the anomaly.17. Where all partners participate in the new service, theMinister proposes to provide by regulation that :(1) compensation will be assessed in respect of the valueof the partnership practice as a whole at the appointed day ;(2) partners may, if they like, agree how the compensationfor the practice shall be apportioned between them and interest will then follow the agreed apportionment ;(3) failing agreement between the partners, compensationwill be assessed and interest will be paid on the basis of the shares which they hold at the appointed day. Whenever the -Minister is later notified that a sale of shares has taken placein accordance with the partnership agreement, the assessment of compensation will then be correspondingly adjusted and interest will follow the change ;(4) in cases of hardship early payments on account ofcompensation will be. made, subject to arrangements forsecuring that if the recipients share of the partnership isafterwards bought by his partners (and he therefore suffersno loss entitling him to compensation) the compensation willbe repaid.18. The Negotiating Committee consider that such arrange-ments would still leave two anomalies :(1) the price which a partner had to pay for the purchase ofa further share under his agreement (which he could notre-sell) might be more than the compensation ;(2) a partner will not necessarily receive interest on the full amount of the compensation which ultimately becomes dueto him.19. The former situation will arise if the value of the practiceincreases as a result of the new health service (involving also anincrease in the income from the practice). It might also arise in individual cases without any change in the income of the practice.The basis on which the purchase price is to be fixed varies fromone agreement to another, and it is just as possible for the priceso fixed to prove smaller, instead of greater than the amount ofthe assessed compensation. Partners who anticipate difficultyfrom this can, if they think it necessary, agree among themselves that the price to be paid for shares bought under the partnershipagreement should be the same as, or not exceed, the compensationassessed in respect of those shares.20. The suggestion that the payment of interest in the manner proposed by the Minister is inequitable seems to be ill-founded.Compensation is provided under the Act to meet the loss whicha practitioner may suffer because he cannot sell his practiceexcept under a partnership agreement in existence on theappointed day. Interest on compensation is paid because, untilthe compensation is finally paid, it has to be regarded as investedcapital. It is true that this capital may change hands under the partnership agreement, but until it does so it seems most equitable- to pay the interest to the owner of the asset for the time being.21. Where one or more partners do not participate in the new service the position will be as follows :(o) compensation will be fixed in respect of the propor-tionate part of the partnership practice belonging to thepartners who do participate ;(6) compensation and interest as between partners inside the service will be paid as in paragraph 17 (2), (3), and (4)above ;(c) a partner within the service, required to buy the shareof a partner not in the service, will receive compensation forthe share so bought on the basis of the value at the appointed day. The value of this share will be ascertained when ascer-taining the value of the shares brought into the service;(rf) it will not be possible to compensate a partner outsidethe service who is required to buy the share of a partnerwithin it. The Act is only concerned with those within theservice and only the partner inside the service will be assured of compensation for any loss. Partners can, however, them-selves arrange to modify their agreements so as to remove any difficulty which might arise from this obligation ;(e) when a partner not participating in the service buys the share of a partner in it, compensation in respect of that sharewill no longer be payable to the partner in the service as hewill have suffered no loss.&apos;22. The effect of paragraph 21 (c) will be payment of compensa-tion for which there is no provision in the aggregate amount ofcompensation. On the other hand, the effect of paragraph 21 (e)will be non-payment of compensation for which there is provision in that aggregate. For the time being it is proposed to proceed on the assumption that the excess on paragraph 21 (c) will be balanced by the saving on paragraph 2! (e), but the preciscannot be known for many years, and probably the baianhardly be exact and will need later adjustment. The Comalso contend that the total amount provided for comnerwill be insufficient if every practitioner in general practicipart in the service before the appointed day. If this happiMinister will ask Parliament to provide an appropriate irin the global sum. All these points are matters for suclamending legislation as experience proves necessary.Partnerships after the Appointed Day23. The main object of new partnerships, entered into afappointed day, will be greater convenience and better fafor carrying on practice. The remuneration of each partncbe assessed on the general basis of his value to the partnand in making this assessment account can be taken not this earnings but also of his knowledge, experience and staThere seems to be no reason whatever why this basis of p;ships should discourage them in future or why the buyniselling of shares should be regarded as the essence of a partnin medical practice. If there is any doubt whether a pndivision of earnings is in accordance with the Act the .\Practices Committee can be asked for their opinion : ithink the proposal is in order they will then issue a certwhich will be a complete defence if the transaction shoulibe questioned.Assistants24. An offence will only be committed if an assistant iso obviously less than&apos; he is worth as to amount to a sgoodwill, and this is obviously not what the professionwish to do. In case of doubt there is again the complete safeof a certificate from the Medical Practices Committee,being so, the Minister cannot think that the difficulties anticby the Negotiating Committee are likely to arise. He eiagrees as to the desirability or an initial period of assistaiand he has suggested to the Committee a scheme of graexperienced practitioners willing to train assistants, whihopes will benefit both principals and assistants alike.The Doctor&apos;s House .25. Some of the difficulties anticipated by the Committtbe met by enabling the Executive Council to buy the houthe incoming doctor. For the rest, the Minister is advisetthere is no risk of committing an offence if the house is cto auction bona fide, whoever may buy it ; and in any icertificate from the Medical Practices Committee will complete protection. The Medical Practices Committeidevised as a professional body so as to ensure that it &apos;understand and pay full regard to the proper interests (profession in the matters before it, and it will have a wide twof discretion.Remuneration26. The Minister proposes the following arrangeilin order to translate the general recommendations ofSpens Committee (which he has. already accepted)!actual terms of remuneration for general practitif(the Spens Committee on Specialists not having!reported): (1) A central fund as contemplated in paragradlof the Negotiating Co&apos;committee&apos;s statement (coilwith the assumption by the profession of collejresponsibility for all who wish to use the new sellwill be established equal to a capitation fee oflmultiplied by 95 % of the civilian population.

Parliament have accepted the view, embodied inthe Act, that as the ultimate responsibility for the service is placed by Parliament on the Minister, it must be leftto him to decide in the last resort whether it is possiblefor him to retain in the public service in any particular area, or even at all, a practitioner whose retention, inthe Tribunals view, &quot; would be prejudicial to theefficiency of the Service.&quot; Any other situation wouldbe impossible. If the Minister is to be answerable toParliament for the success of the service, he cannot beput in a position where he has to answer for a doctorwhom he is forced to retain. The Minister thinks thatit would help him to consult an Advisory Committeeof the type which has hitherto advised on similar casesarising under the Insurance Scheme and provision willbe made for this in regulations.29. Nor would such a &quot;situation apply to any otherprofession or vocation. Of course, there is fully retainedthe doctors&apos; ordinary legal rights to go to the Courts onthe grounds of unlawful action by the Minister or others.Nor are the rights of the Genera! Medical Council inany way prejudiced.Midwifery30. There is no suggestion, of course, that any qualifiedmedical practitioner should be in any way debarred frompractising midwifery. The new health service, is con-cerned with arrangements for maternity only within theservice. There have been some discussions on this withgeneral practitioners, midwives and others, and theMinister is advised that the best arrangements to securethat the standard of attention for the expectant mothersis uniformly good throughout the new service should beas follows. The hospital and specialist service willprovide for specialist obstetrics and for confinements in hospitals. Otherwise all general practitioners in a local health authority&apos;s area will be asked to say whether ornot they wish to practise midwifery and to answer callsby midwives for medical aid under the Midwives Act,as applied to the new service by the new Act. Any who wish to do so will be asked the extent and nature of theirobstetrical practice during the preceding three years.Their particulars will be put before a local professionalcommittee (including general practitioners, a localconsulting obstetrician and the medical officer of health).This committee will decide on the list of local practi-practitioners suitable for answering calls from midwives andat the same time taking part in the maternity services provided by the new Act. Others, not included in the list, will need further obstetrical experience first, and the list will be periodically reviewed.31. Every woman will be entitled under the Act, forall ordinary purposes, to the medical advice and treat-ment of a general practitioner, by their mutual agree-ment. She will no doubt consult him in pregnancy, and,for her confinement, he will tell her how to obtain the

It is contemplated that the patient will normallyspecialist advice through his family doctor, who will referjib a written statement of the case.   Exceptionally,the patient may seek specialist treatment direct for from a venereal diseases clinic.   With regard tojslic facilities, it will be an objective of the service thatreasonable facilities should be available directly to general practitioners; but the first call on hospital facilities must be tomeet the needs of the hospital service, and only as they can be developed will they become more generally available.Appointment of Specialists51. It is proposed that appointments of medical staffup to and including registrars at non-teaching hospitals should be made by the Hospital Management Com-mittees. Senior appointments, however, should be madeby the Regional Boards on the advice of an appointmentscommittee constituted according to the nature of theappointment, but including in all cases representatives ofthe Management Committee or Committees concerned.The Minister agrees that the more exact constitution ofthese committees must be worked out at an early date,and he proposes to do so. He also shares the view thatit would be an advantage for the appointments com-mittees for non-teaching hospital posts to includeuniversity representatives and expert assessors from otherregional areas, and guidance to this effect will be givento Regional Boards.General Terms of Service52. The Minister notes the committee&apos;s views on the method of remuneration of specialists, which he will have to consider further with the profession when he has received the report of the SpensCommittee on Specialists. As to the domiciliary seivicc, he considers that specialists should, as widely as practicable (though not universally), be expected to accept as part of their duties theundertaking of domiciliary work within defined limits. Theprinciples proposed by the Committee for the operation of theservice accord with his own views.Chairmen53. The Minister thinks that any views expressed by boards of Governors and Management Committees about the succession to the Chairmanship should clearly be given full weight; but their position as his direct agents in administering the servicemakes it essential that the final decision should lie constitutionallywith the Minister in each case.LOCAL HEALTH AUTHORITY SERVICESy Health Committeewas the decision of Parliament that Local Healthlilies, as responsible local government bodies, ought notSEctated to on the co-optation of non-elected members onBialth Committees. The Minister has no powers offiion in the matter and would not wish to seek them.Bess, he has encouraged and will continue to encourage&quot;authorities to use the powers conferred on them to co-optEed people so as to secure, among other objectives, theof representatives of the medical profession in the area,jures quoted by the Committee show, the majority oflies have done so.Remuneration55. The Minister agrees with the Committee. The details of future negotiating machinery are at present under discussionwith the profession and all other professions concerned.Decentralization of Local Health Authority services56. The Committee is under a misapprehension here. Schemesof decentralization, as so far advocated by the Minister, cannotthemselves result in depriving the county district medical officersof health of any part of their work. The Act itself irrespective of any decentralization governs any effect the service may have on these officers.MENTAL HEALTH service so of responsibilityIke Minister fully recognizes the importance of the pointsithis paragraph, and his views have been conveyed bothionat Hospital Boards and Local Health Authorities in&quot;merits already issued to them.II memorandum on the mental health services issued toilBoards, there is the following passage:  Mil be apparent that the efficient administration of theMai health service will depend in a crucial degree uponJe effective linking of the operations of the Regionalwards on the one hand and of the Local HealthMiorities on the other.&quot;^ for close co-operation is emphasized throughout theTjdum and several parts of it refer specifically to thelies of joint user of officers, including psychiatrists,jiCircular issued to Local Health Authorities on the with services the importance is stressed of maintainingKch with the Regional Boards and the Hospital Manage-nmmittees, and also the desirability of arranging for jointofficers, including psychiatrists. Local Health Authoritieshave been asked to include in their proposals (which have tobe submitted for approval under the Act) the extent to whichthey propose to arrange for the joint user of specialist medics!officers of the Regional Boards.60. As to grouping, the Circular says : &quot; Two or more Authorities may agree arrangements for thejoint user of an officer having special qualifications or experience in mental health work to act as medical adviser to their mental health service sub-committees.&quot;Regional Psychiatrists61. Memoranda already issued to Regional Hospital Boardsindicate the Ministers view that the Boards should appoint amental health services committee or sub-committee and a RegionalPsychiatrist. The status of the latter post, and its remuneration,have been discussed with the Mental Health Services Sub-Committee of the Negotiating Committee, as a result of whichthe proposed scale of salary has been reconsidered. This hasnow been fixed at a figure which, in the Ministers opinion,should attract men of appropriate standing to fill these posts.(p for added yearsHjjjra are not alone among professional people whoBfWiy training period before entering on remunerativeBr*it.

For the average doctor.
this will happen at about the age of 23 or 24. From then onwardshis service will build up in the scheme through his variousemployments in hospitals, clinics, and practitioner service. Hewill be able to retire at 60, though if he stays on till 63 or 64(when he will have done his forty years&apos; service), he will get alarger pension. In comparison with, for example, the localgovernment scheme now, he will be much better off because atpresent his service does not begin to count until he has taken upa local government appointment which may be after a period ofpractitioner service and certainly after his training hospital workand he cannot retire until he has done forty years&apos; service orreached the age of 65.Immediate cover against incapacity or death63. Other public service schemes require a period of qualifica-tion before benefits are payable. In the proposed scheme it isfive years for death gratuity and a gratuity on incapacity and tenyears for pension on retirement on age or incapacity. Thescheme requires no medical examination and it cannot take ona quite unknown liability, in respect of people who may beunsound lives, without some preliminary period of service.,64. As to elderly doctors who come in at the beginning, theywill get compensation for the loss of their right to sell theirpractices ; and this represents what they would normally have expected to get, quite apart from the further benefits providedby the new scheme.The suggestion that the proposed widow&apos;s pension isinadequate65. The widow&apos;s pension is one-third of the pension which the doctor would have got had he retired on account of incapacityAny increase on this would have meantnational insurance arrangement; which after 5th Julyapply to everyone. It should be remembered that thismajor public service scheme which has included a widowat all.66. As to the reductions to be made where the wife isthan the husband, no reduction at all is made where thunder 42 or in any case where the wife is not more thanyounger.   The more advanced the age of the man thwill be the pension which he has earned and therefore the amount from which the widow&apos;s pension is denreduction at all is made whatever the difference in agewidow has to look after children of school age.Provision for Transfer of Superannuation RighMedical Officer going from Local Governmentversity Service67.

The whole administrative structure of the new the Central Health Services Council has to have ahealth service represents the profession as never before.On the Regional Hospital Boards, Boards of governors of Teaching Hospitals, Management Committees, Exe-executive Councils, strong representation is assured. TheMedical Practices Committee is almost wholly medical.The Tribunal has one medical member out of three. a standing Medical Advisory Committee is proposed and powers OF THE MINISTERmajority. The nominations of the British MAssociation, though important, are not the only iof medical representation. The Royal Collegflothers have also to be taken into full account^Minister has intended to bring the profession rig!the direct administration of the service, with the!concerned, and any analysis of the bodies so far)will show that he has done so.70. The constitutional basis of the new service is thata Minister the Minister of Health is made answerable to Parliament and the nation for it. It would be im-possible to combine this responsibility with any lack of ultimate jurisdiction as to the nature and quality of theservice provided. The Act has gone a long way as faras it justifiably could in providing for the Minister to delegate that responsibility (which he cannot disclaim)to bodies, regional and local, in which the professionand others are strongly represented. By regulation, totake only one instance, the Minister has taken no powerto remove any member of a Regional Hospital Boardwhile his term of office lasts unless the Board itselfrecommends it. On the Executive Council he iscom-mitted entirely to the acceptance of the profession^nominees and professional people (doctors,and pharmacists) have been given one half of thejbership, compared with the much smaller represeqon the present Insurance Committees. the health Services Council and the Standing AtCommittee have an absolute right to advise, vasked or not, and the Minister has an obligatpublish their report and their views, save only wlpublic interest might be at stake. The Act, if swill be found to represent a degree of decentraland a degree of professional administration wprobably unequalled in any other field in wMinister remains completely answerable to the for its good or ill administration.GENERAL71. In the Committee&apos;s paper and in this paper attention hasnecessarily focussed on particular issues-important issues enough,but each needing to be seen against the wider background of the project as a whole. The Minister knows, without need of reassur-ance, that the medical profession like the other great professionsin the health sphere is actuated in the ultimate resort solely by its professional concern in the welfare of the men, women andchildren whose care it undertakes and who are wholly dependenton that care. As the responsible Minister of the Crown in thatsphere,&apos;he has precisely the same object at heart. Differences ofopinion as to means and methods are important, but never insur-mountable and cannot conceivably be allowed to override theman objective. A sincere co-operation between the profession andthe Minister can ensure the greatest health service this or any other country has yet known ; a failure to co-operate can redound onlyto the detriment of the people whom both wish to serve. Acts ofParliament are never infallible ; legislation is a constantly iand re-shaping process. There will be amending Acts, Milldoubt, and the scheme will so be bettered and rcmoiexperience is gained. But first it has to be begun, if therethat experience. The Minister is confident that the massand women working in the medical field now, or about towill join him in beginning it and as the lessons of trial acome in constantly improving it.72. To be ready by the appointed day, much preparatemust be pushed on as fast as possible. This will obvkbetter done, and the whole service better administered, isentatives of the medical profession continue to take ipreparatory organisation (without commitment), and the 1hopes that they will do so while the views of individual iof the profession are being ascertained.December, 1947.Printed bj- St, Clements Bbe3S, Ltd., PortusiJ St., Londgm W.C.3-
