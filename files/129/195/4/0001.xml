DIRECT ELECTIONS TO THE EUROPEAN ASSEMBLY.A LIST SYSTEM(Note &quot;by Officials)ProductionI.    In essence, the list system of election is simple;   hut over the yearssophisticated variations have been developed in different countries.   The primaryP^Pose of a list system is to ensure that total seats won by a political party&amp;re proportionate to total votes cast for that party.   The main variations in theWem relate to the exactness of this proportionality and the extent to which ane^ctor can vote for ruunsd candidates as well as (or instead of) a political party.2.    At one extreme, the electoral area could be the whole United Kingdom and the^lot paper could list only the political parties.   The votes for each party would*e totalled nationally and the 8l United Kingdom seats would be allocated to each^rty according to a formula.   In principle, a party obtaining 25 per cent of thetQtal votes cast should be allocated 25 per cent of the seats (either 20 or 21^ats depending on the formula).   In this system, the Individuals to take theseb would be drawn from the (published) list of candidates drawn up by thePolitical party in the order listed there.   Electors would have no direct say inthi* choice.   Each political party could draw support from all parts of theUnited Kingdom;    for example, supporters of the Scottish, Northern   Irish or WelshNationalist parties living in London could vote for the nationalist party oftheir choisaeatnee.ReSionai ListsAnother possibility would be the regionally system.   A.single list for EnglandWo*U be difficult to manage.   For this reason a regional list system would bedeferable to a national list system.   It would also allow some of the virtues ofthe &quot;first past the post&quot; system to be retained.   Regional feeling andRatification is a recognisable factor in England, and many of the issues^cussed in the European Assembly have as much significance for a region in***** as for an ad hoc European constituency.   With a regional list of candidates,^iaual candidates are more likely to be known to the voter than with a national^   There would also appear tc be more scope for involving existing WestminsterC0*sHtuency organisations in the selection process for ,
4-    The United Kingdom could he divided into a number of eleotoral areas with separate voting arrangements for each,   Tnus Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland^Uld each constitute a separate electoral area, with electors in Scotland having no direct influence on the outcome of the election in Wales.   Northern Ireland^Uld fcave the single transferable vote system:   England would be divided intoec^omic planning regions for eleotoral purposes but the GLG area would be separated from the South East planning region.   The number of seats for eachregion would be allocated on the basis of electorate.   As an example the seatsmight be allocated under this system as fellows -Region	SeatsScotland	8Wales	4Northern Ireland	3South-East England (exc QIC)	14Greater London	10South-West England	6East Anglia and East Midlands	8West Midlands	7N W England	9Yorkshire and Humberside	7Northern England	5Party^he ballot paper in a regional list system would show the names of individualdates with their party affiliations.   This procedure would enable the to express preferences between individual candidates as well as betweenParti PC!ws*   Individual identification of the votes with a particular candidate^ one of the strengths of the traditional first-past-the-post system that canGained in a regional list system.St^cture6&apos;    Atpresent, even the major parties have no official status in terms ofral law;    in form at least candidates fight elections to Westminster as^^ividuuuais, although a party description can be printed on the ballot paper.
It would &quot;be necessary for the political parties to develop a satisfactory procedure for drawing up the regional party listso   It is for consideration whether a legislative framework should be established within which the roles of party organisations, perhaps including those in constituencies, might be provided for.Independents7.     Independent candidates could be permitted to stand for election providedthat they had nominations from the set number of electors, and that they couldmeet the necessary deposit.cost.    A list system would probably cost much the same to run as a first-past-the-post system.   The main administrative costs in both would relate to postage andto polling and counting arrangements.   There might be some additional costs if a longer or more complicated ballot paper were used, but some saving if no boundary commission procedure were folloxved.Informat ion9.    Because a list system would be new to the UK, there would need to be areasonable period of time for the political parties, candidates and electors to learn about the workings of the new system.   Information and training would alsoprobably be needed for the local authority staffs who would be responsible for conducting the poll and the count.   This suggests that the relevant legislation would need Royal Assent by the end of 1977 if elections were to be held inMay-June 1978.Ballot paper10,   The ballot papers for each region would contain the names of candidatesdrawn up in party lists, each party being entitled to nominate as many candidatesas there are seats.   In the North-West England region, for example with 9 seats,there might be 3 parties putting forward 9 candidates each, with 3 other partiesputting forward Bay 2 candidates each.   The ballot paper would thus contain 33names.3
Vo-tirig and CountingU.   Each elector would have one vote which he would east for a na^ed candidateof one of the parties.   The total votes east for all the candidates of each party would he calculated, and the parties would he allocated seats in proportion to^eir total share of the poll.   Thus, in a 4-seat region, a party gaining   oftotal votes would he allocated 1 seat.   This seat would go to the namedcandidate of that party who had received the most individual votes.   Odd seatsfining after the first allocation could he allocated on the &quot;largest remainder&quot;Principle.The following tahles show how this might work:^PiLwith 4 seat!&apos;, votes cast 3,000,000Candidate AlA2A3A4Totes Cast360,000340,000250,000250,0001,200,000ELECTEDELECTEDcandidate BlB2B3B4400,000370,000200,00070,0001,040,000ELECTED^ iy^CGandidate ClC2395,000365,000ELECTED760,000
