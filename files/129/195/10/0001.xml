DIRECT ELECTIONS TO THE EUROPEAN assembly the background. The United Kingdom became a member of the European community in 1973 and our membership was endorsed by the referendum of 1975. Thisfundamental decision has implications for the relationship between our formof government and the institutions of the Community.2. The European Community was established in 1958 by the coming intoforce of the Treaty of Rome. Article 138 (3) of the Treaty provides for theintroduction of a system of elections to the European Assembly on the basis of&quot; direct universal suffrage in accordance with a uniform procedure for all member States &quot;. However, for the past 19 years, members of the european assembly have been nominated by national Parliaments from among their members in accordance with Article 138 (1).3. The European Assembly is very different from the Westminster Parlia-ment since it has no independent legislative functions and a government is notformed from its members. As Article 137 of the Treaty of Rome explains, ithas &quot; advisory and supervisory powers &quot;. However, it does have certain limited powers in relation to the Community budget and it has the power to dismissthe whole of the European Commission. The present nominated Assemblyconsists of 198 members of whom 36 represent the United Kingdom. When it is directly elected, the Assembly will have 410 members, 81 of them from theUnited Kingdom.4. Direct elections have increasingly been seen as an important meansof strengthening democratic participation in Community affairs. A green paper on direct elections to the European Assembly (Cmnd. 6399) was presented to Parliament in February 1976.5. Following a debate in the House of Commons in March 1976, a SelectCommittee was appointed &quot; to consider proposals for Direct Elections to theEuropean Assembly and arrangements requiring action by Parliament and bythe European Community following the Governments commitment to proceedto such elections&quot;. The Select Committee have produced three reports.The Government is indebted to the Committee for their recommendations onthe many issues involved. The Committee&apos;s reports have been of great assist-ance to the Government in their consideration of these difficult matters.6. Agreement was reached between all member States on 20 September1976 on the text of a Council Decision on direct elections (published asCmnd. 6623). This Agreement lays down that, subject to its provisions, the electoral procedures for these first direct elections should be governed by thenational provisions of each member State. The substantive provisions of theAgreement will not come into force until all member States have completed their respective constitutional requirements. The preamble to the Decisionrecords the agreed intention of member States that the first direct elections tothe European Assembly should be held in the period May/June 1978.   In
recognition, however, of the possibility that some member States might have difficulty in completing the necessary legislative and other preparatory stages in that timescale, no binding date for first elections was set. The Agreementprovides for the Council, acting unanimously after consulting the Assembly,to determine the date of the first elections at a later stage. Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment has undertaken to use its best endeavours to be ready for electionsby May/June 1978 and The Queen&apos;s Speech of November 1976 contained a commitment to introduce the necessary legislation in the current Session ofParliament.7. There are fundamental constitutional issues involved in direct elections to the European Assembly. It is the view of the Government that beforelegislation is introduced there should be debate in Parliament and in the countryin which all aspects of the matter are considered. The purpose of this white paper is to put the issues involved before the Parliament and the people of theUnited Kingdom.
PART I: THE CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUESThe Electoral System8. The electoral system to be used for direct elections to the european assembly presents a most difficult issue. The UK has a distinctive electoralsystem which has developed gradually over the last one and a half centuriesand which is different from that of any other e.c. Member State. It hasstood the test of time and it is well understood by the electorate at large and bythe political Parties.9. With certain limited exceptions, all local and national elections in the uk have always been on the basis of the simple majority (first-past-the-post)electoral system. The concept of the constituency is a fundamental part of our traditional electoral practice and at both local and national level each personelected has owed a special allegiance to a distinct and comparatively smallelectorate. This local power base has not been without significance in theHouse of Commons itself, where the individual Member of Parliament oftenplays a distinctive part in influencing the policies of the Government and of his party. The advantage of the single member constituency is that the electorvotes for a particular candidate in the clear knowledge that the candidate whoobtains most votes will be elected and will act as his Member.10. Furthermore, the careful and objective drawing of constituency boundaries by statutory Boundary Commissions, independent of the Govern-ment of the day, with the right of electors to challenge proposed boundariesand with the necessity for subsequent approval by Parliament, has become anessential part of our democratic process.11. All these traditional practices are basic to the Westminster type ofParliamentary democracy. They should not be changed or curtailed for directelections to the European Assembly except after the most careful considerationof the present and future implications of such a step.12. Another relevant factor is the growth of Party organisations alongside the development of our democratic institutions and reflecting the nature ofthese institutions. The structure of Party organisations has been developed atconstituency, regional and national level, with Party conferences playing a significant role. Within the Party system, the selection of candidates tends tobe de-centralized and exercised by the local constituency. Whatever form of electoral practice emerges, Party organisation and selection of candidates willboth be affected by a move to direct elections to the European Assembly.13. Our partners in the e.c., with their different historical traditions, have developed different electoral systems. Most of them use some form of pro-portional representation for national elections; and, for elections to theEuropean Assembly, it seems likely that, apart from the Republic of Ireland(where it is proposed to use the single transferable vote system of election),all other member States will use some form of list system. (Details of thesystems used or expected to be used by the other members of the e.c. are given
in Annex A.) Thus, if we use our traditional simple majority system forthe first direct elections to the European Assembly, there will be significantdifferences between our procedure and that of the other eight countries whowill be electing members to the same Assembly.14. There are other considerations which result from some of the inherentcharacteristics of the existing British system. One of these characteristics isthe tendency for swings in electoral opinion to be magnified in terms of seatswon or lost. This is regarded by many as an advantage in the context of westminster elections where a Government is being elected. In the context ofEuropean elections, however, it might be regarded as a less desirable feature.This would be especially so if, as some studies have suggested, the relatively small number of Assembly constituencies (81 as compared with 635 Westminsterconstituencies) further magnified the effect with a final result in terms of seatswhich was quite disproportionate to votes cast. There is the further point that, particularly if Assembly elections fell mid-way between General elections to Westminster, there could be a wide divergence between the balance of power at Westminster and the Party composition of the United Kingdom membersof the European Assembly. In one respect, given the advisory nature of theEuropean Assembly, this might not be a matter of much concern; but in adeveloping situation it could lead to friction between the Government at westminster and the UK representatives in the directly elected european assembly or even between the Government and the Assembly itself.15. It would be possible to resolve some of these problems by adopting asystem of proportional representation for elections to the European Assembly.Since the European Assembly does not constitute a legislature or provide agovernment, and since its members do not have the same constituency respon-sibilities as a Westminster MP, proportional representation for the european assembly might not be open to the same objections as proportional representa-tion for the Westminster Parliament. A different institution might warrant adifferent form of election.16. A list system could be devised based on the whole of the UnitedKingdom or Great Britain; or on separate lists for their constituent parts;or England could be sub-divided into regions or constituencies, each beingallocated a number of members on the basis of electorate. The adoption of alist system would bring us into line with the majority of our European partnersand would ensure that the allocation of seats was more proportional to the votes cast for the competing Parties. It would also have advantages in the speed with which it could be brought into operation, since there would not bemore than about a dozen regions and even if Boundary Commission procedureswere necessary they would be less elaborate than would be required to define81 new constituencies. (Annex B shows how a regional list system might workin practice.)17. To abandon our traditional method in this way would be a majorconstitutional innovation, the consequences of which are difficult to foresee.It would mean the absence of the sort of constituency link with which we are familiar and could lead to changes in Party organisations, including giving the
central or regional Party organisations a bigger role in nominating candidates.The electorate might take time to become accustomed to the new system and might be confused by the existence of separate procedures for national and European elections, although the Northern Ireland electorate have copedwith a similar situation since 1973. Furthermore, there might have to be yet another change if in accordance with the Treaty of Rome there is, in due course, a move to put European elections on a common basis and a differentsystem is then adopted. This would be a matter for all Community govern-ments and their respective Parliaments.18. Besides the simple majority and list systems, a third possible electoralsystem is the single transferable vote, which is another form of proportional representation. It has already been used for local government, convention and Assembly elections in Northern Ireland. Such a system involves multi-member constituencies and the elector votes for as many candidates as he wishes in order of preference. This system gives maximum influence to theelector, who is able to express a preference between the different candidates ofthe Party of his choice as well as between the candidates of other Parties.Such a system would retain the concept of the constituency, but geographicallysuch constituencies would be larger than single member European constituencies in a simple majority system of election and much larger than the Westminsterconstituencies used in our General Elections. The United Kingdom&apos;s 81 seatsmight be allocated to about a dozen constituencies each returning between three and 10 members, depending on size of electorate. (See Annex C forfurther details of this system.)19. However, STV like the list system, would involve fundamental depar-tures from our traditional electoral practice and would again mean that wewere using different electoral systems for national and European elections.It too might require some kind of boundary procedure, but this again would beless complex than that necessary if we were to use the simple majority system.20. Whatever electoral system were used, it would be important to ensure a democratic procedure for the selection of candidates and to involve the constituency party organisations in this procedure to the fullest possible extent.-Compulsory Dual Mandate21. Another consideration is the relationship between Assembly members and Westminster MPs. Since the inception of the e.c., members of theAssembly have been nominated by the national Parliaments of the member states and have been drawn exclusively from the members of these Parliaments.The UK adopted this procedure on its accession to the e.c. in January 1973.A requirement that once direct elections have been introduced members of theAssembly should be members of the House of Commons is known by the term&quot; the compulsory dual mandate &quot;. This would minimise the risk of divergen-cies between Assembly members and other Westminster members of the sameParty. Without a compulsory dual mandate, Assembly members who werenot also members of the Westminster Parliament would tend to be out of touch
with developments at Westminster and might regard themselves as owing a primary allegiance to European rather than national Parties.22. There are a number of disadvantages and practical difficulties to be weighed against the advantages of a compulsory dual mandate. The strainof performing the double task could be great though some of this might be avoided through changes in procedure in the House of Commons. In addition,it would be necessary to provide for the situation where an Assembly memberlost his Westminster seat at a national election which did not coincide with elections to the Assembly. Moreover, following direct elections,the dual mandate concept might be much more difficult to operate than hitherto.At present the United Kingdom sends 36 delegates, some of whom come fromthe House of Lords; but after direct elections we shall send 81 members, all of whom would have to come from the House of Commons under a compulsorydual mandate system. Furthermore, when the European Assembly is directly elected and the overwhelming majority of its members do not sit in a nationallegislature, the Assembly is likely to have a more intensive scheme of business which pays little regard to the times of sittings of the various national legislatures.(See Annex D for further details of the compulsory dual mandate.)Options23. As the preceding paragraphs show, the United Kingdom faces anumber of difficult problems in its approach to direct elections to the european assembly, some of which are not shared by our e.c. partners. The Governmentis aware of the important constitutional issues involved. It is also conscious of the undesirability of making major constitutional changes unless they havea wide measure of support. There appear to be four main possibilities: tostick to our traditional simple majority electoral system; to change to a listsystem of proportional representation, probably on a regional basis; to change to STV; or to combine one of these electoral systems with the compulsory dualmandate. Each of these possibilities has some attractions; but each alsopresents serious difficulties. Before coming to a conclusion on this, theGovernment wishes to listen to the views expressed in Parliament and elsewhere.24. Whatever electoral system is used in the rest of the United kingdom for direct elections to the European Assembly, the Government considers thatthe special circumstances of Northern Ireland would make it appropriate for direct elections there to be conducted by a system of proportional representation.
PART II: RESPONSE TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE(1) Simple Majority System25. The Select Committee on Direct Elections to the European Assemblyrecommended that the first elections be conducted on our normal simple majority electoral system. If this is to be the basis of these elections, then theGovernment will wish to see the following arrangements on the particular points on which the Select Committee has made recommendations in its second and Third Reports.Allocation of Seats26. It will be necessary to decide upon the allocation of our 81 seatsamong the component parts of the United Kingdom. It would be possibleto base the allocation of seats directly in accordance with the size of the electorate in each of the component parts or in accordance with currentrepresentation at Westminster, or in other ways. For the first elections,bearing in mind, among other things, the special circumstances of NorthernIreland, the Government proposes accepting the Select Committee&apos;s recom-mendation on the allocation of seats. This would give England 66 seats,Scotland 8, Wales 4 and Northern Ireland 3. For subsequent elections, theallocation of seats and the determination of boundaries (which is dealt withbelow) could be referred to a Speakers Conference on Electoral Law.Determination of Constituencies27. The Government would agree with the Select Committee&apos;s recom-mendations that the European Assembly constituencies should be formed bygrouping existing Parliamentary constituencies and that the number of electorsin each of the European Assembly constituencies should be approximately equal (with some exceptions for geographical reasons). Northern ireland would, however, form a single European constituency. As explained above,the Government considers that the special circumstances of Northern ireland would make it appropriate for direct elections there to be conducted by asystem of proportional representation; if the rest of the United Kingdom usesthe simple majority system, STV would be used in Northern Ireland.28. The procedures for the determination of Westminster constituenciesare laid down in the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Acts 1949and 1958. These procedures make provision for representations to be madeto the Boundary Commissions about their provisional recommendations andfor local inquiries to be held; if necessary, two rounds of representations andlocal inquiries may take place.29. The Select Committee have recommended that the European Assemblyconstituencies should be determined on the basis of recommendations from theParliamentary Boundary Commissions, using as far as possible similar pro-procedures to those employed by the Commissions in the reviews of Parliamentaryconstituency boundaries.  The Government shares the view that it would be
desirable for the Parliamentary Boundary Commissions to be asked to make recommendations on the determination of the boundaries for european assembly constituencies. The Select Committee believed that some curtailment of these full procedures would be necessary for elections to be held in May/June1978 and recommended that the existing procedures should be followed, but with provision for one round only of local representations and inquiries. TheGovernment accept that some curtailment of the full Parliamentary constituencyreview procedures will be necessary for the first elections if they are to be heldin May/June 1978, although it might be appropriate for the full procedures tobe followed for subsequent elections.30. In the Governments view, for the first elections a choice would haveto be made between the following three options:A. Boundary Commission recommendations following one round of representations and local inquiries, orB. Boundary Commission recommendations following one round of representations but no local inquiries, orC. Boundary Commission recommendations with no representationsor local inquiries.In evidence to the Select Committee, the Boundary Commissions suggestedthat from the time of Royal Assent to the relevant legislation up to the sub-mission of their reports, Option A would take a minimum of 30 weeks,Option B a minimum of 18 weeks and Option C a minimum of nine weeks.Bearing in mind that some six months will be needed to select candidates and prepare for the elections, the Boundary Commissions will need to complete their work by the end of 1977 if elections are to be held in May/June 1978.31. The Government considers that it would be unsatisfactory for thereto be no provision for either representations or local inquiries and thereforefinds Option C unattractive. On the other hand, there is insufficient time tobe at all sure of implementing Option A. With some reluctance, the Govern-ment therefore inclines in favour of Option B for the first elections, since thiswould at least provide some opportunity for the political parties and other interested bodies to express a view on the Commissions&apos; provisional recommendations.Franchise32. The Government agrees with the Select Committee that the franchisefor European Assembly elections should in general be the same as for UnitedKingdom Parliamentaiy elections with the addition of peers. The committee recommended that the franchise should be extended to certain United kingdom nationals resident overseas; but the Government does not consider that this important extension, which would have obvious relevance to the franchisefor Westminster, should be made without prior consideration by a speakers conference.
Disqualification33. The Government proposes accepting the Select Committee&apos;s recom-mendation on disqualification. This would mean that (unless there were a compulsory dual mandate) the rules governing disqualification of candidates for Westminster elections would be applied with the modification that peers and all clergymen would be allowed to stand for election to the european assembly. Members of the Westminster Parliament would not be disqualified from election to the European Assembly.Conduct of Elections34. The Government accepts the Select Committee&apos;s recommendation that in general normal United Kingdom Parliamentary electoral law should apply to the conduct of European Assembly elections. This would cover thepresent arrangements for absent voting by post Or proxy and the anangementsfor service voting.Deposits-35. The Select Committee recommended that the deposit should be setat  150 for each Parliamentary constituency contained in the european assembly constituency. This would mean that for an Assembly constituencycontaining five Parliamentary constituencies the deposit would be  750, while for one containing 10 Parliamentary constituencies it would be  1,500. TheGovernment takes the view that it would be preferable for a fixed and ratherlower deposit to be set and proposes the sum of  500 irrespective of the size of the Assembly constituency concerned. A deposit of this size would deterfrivolous candidature without unreasonably inhibiting genuine candidates.Nominations36. The Select Committee recommended that nominations should be accompanied by the signatures of ten per Westminster constituency of thoseeligible to vote in the European Assembly constituency. The government considers that the number of nominations required for European Assemblyelections should be greater than that requiied for a Westminster election, but does not consider that the increase should be in proportion. The government therefore proposes that, if the simple majority system is adopted, nominationsshould be accompanied by the signature of a fixed number of electors in eachEuropean Assembly constituency and proposes that this number should beset at about 50.uiv.Returning Officers37. The Select Committee recommended that in England and Wales the returning officer should be appointed by the Chief Executive for the county(including metropolitan counties and the Greater London Council) in whichthe European Assembly constituency (or the larger part of it) is situated. InScotland, they recommended that the returning officer should be appointed bythe Secretary of State from among those appointed to act as returning officers
at regional or islands council elections. In Northern Ireland, they recom-mended that the returning officer should be the Chief Electoral Officer for NorthernIreland. The Government accepts the recommendations in relation to Scotlandand Northern Ireland, but considers that it would be more appropriate inEngland and Wales for the Secretary of State to appoint the returning officers from among the returning officers for the relevant Parliamentary constituencies(the sheriff of the county or the mayor of the borough or the chairman of thedistrict council). They would be required to delegate most of their duties toan acting returning officer.Election Expenses Limits38. The Government proposes, as recommended by the Select Committee,to consult the political parties on an appropriate formula for limiting candidates&apos;election expenses. The Government would propose that there should be a freepostal delivery of candidates&apos; election addresses on the same basis as for parliamentary elections.By-Elections39. The Select Committee recommended that the machinery for fillingAssembly vacancies should be set in motion by means of a writ moved in theHouse of Commons. The Government does not consider that the procedure would be entirely appropriate, since unless there is a compulsory dual mandateMembers of the Assembly may not be members of the House of Commons.The Government accepts that arrangements will need to be made to ensure thatthere is no clash between Westminster and European Assembly by-elections and is at present considering how best to deal with this.Broadcasting40. The Select Committee pointed out that broadcasting raises special problems in relation to direct elections. The Government accepts the SelectCommittee&apos;s recommendation that the full implications of this should be examined through the existing machinery for the provision of party political broadcasts.Finance41. The Government considers that the cost of administering european assembly elections (estimated to be at least  10 million) should be met out ofthe Consolidated Fund. The Government has not yet formed a view on whether candidates should receive any reimbursement of their expenses from central funds. This matter is being considered in the context of the Governmentsconsideration of the recommendations made by the Committee on financial aid to Political Parties (Cmnd. 6601).Other Matters42. There are other matters (such as the anangements for electoral registration and for the avoidance of double voting, the counting of votes and
the declaration of results) that will need to be covered. The Governmentagrees with the Select Committee that these matters should be conducted inaccordance with normal Parliamentary electoral law and practice. It will,however, be necessary to make certain adaptations to fit the circumstances ofEuropean Assembly elections.(2) List System43. If the electoral system used in the first direct elections were a regionallist system of the kind outlined in Annex B rather than the simple majoritysystem, then the Government would have to make a different response to someof the recommendations of the Select Committee.44. The Bill could specify the regions to be adopted and the number of seats to be allocated to each region. These regions might be the economic planning regions, which are well known. Alternatively, some form of boundary commission procedure might be desirable, especially if such recognised regionswere to be sub-divided.45. It may be that a regional list system would call for a different view onthe appropriate value of the deposit and number of nominations and on theappointment of returning officers. If the list system were used, it wouldprobably be unnecessary to hold by-elections.46. The other arrangements (including allocation of seats among thecomponent parts of the U.K., candidature and franchise) would in generalbe the same as for the simple majority system.(3) Single Transferable Vote47. If the electoral system used in the first direct elections were a single transferable vote system of the kind outlined in Annex C rather than the simple majority system, then the Government would have to make a differentresponse to some of the recommendations of the Select Committee.48. As with the list system, the Bill could specify the constituencies to beadopted and the number of seats to be allocated to each constituency. Theseconstituencies might be based on well established regions such as the economic planning regions. Alternatively, some form of Boundary Commission pro-cedure might be desirable, especially if such recognised regions were to besub-divided to make STV constituencies.49. It may be that the use of STV would call for a different view on theappropriate value of the deposit and number of nominations and on the appoint-ment of returning officers. If STV were used, it would probably be necessaryto hold by-elections.50. As with the list system, the other arrangements would in general bethe same as for the simple majority system.
(4) Compulsory Dual Mandate51. If there were a compulsory dual mandate, the Governments response to the recommendations of the Select Committee (which envisaged an optionaldual mandate) would depend on the electoral system used. Since the essential feature of the compulsory dual mandate is that all UK members of the european assembly would have to be members of the House of Commons, the rules governing disqualification of candidates for Westminster elections would beapplied without the modification proposed by the Select Committee that peers and all clergymen would be allowed to stand for election to the Assembly.Depending on the electoral system adopted, appropriate arrangements would need to be made for filling vacancies in the event of a member of the House ofCommons, who was also a member of the Assembly, losing his seat at westminster.
ELECTORAL SYSTEMS IN OTHER MEMBER STATESBelgium1. The Chamber of Representatives has 212 Members elected from 30constituencies which return between three and 32 Members in each constituency.The political parties present lists of candidates in each constituency (with separate lists of substitutes to fill casual vacancies). The elector may voteeither for the list or for a particular candidate on that list. The votes cast for aparticular candidate count as a vote for the list of which he is a member. Listvotes and candidates votes are added together in each constituency to find the total number of votes cast and the number of votes cast is divided by thenumber of seats in the constituency to find the electoral divisor and each party&apos;s constituency total is then divided by this divisor to find the numberof seats which it has won. Votes for a list go to the candidates in the ordertheir names appear on the list, but personal votes go to the candidates con-cerned and may result in lower candidates being elected over the heads of thoseabove.2. The last election, held in 1974, returned three national parties (dividedinto independent Flemish and francophone wings), three (smaller) regionalistparties, a small splinter group and a small Communist party.3. Direct Elections: Discussion is continuing about the arrangements for direct elections. It seems likely that there will be some form of party listsystem but without the separate list for substitutes.Denmark4. The Folketing is a single chamber Parliament with 179 seats. Denmarkuses a list system of considerable complexity. The end result is, however,simple. Each party obtaining more than 2 per cent of the total vote is represen-ted in the Folketing in almost exact proportion to the votes it received at theelection. 135 of the Folketing seats are divided between constituencies accordingto the distribution of population. These &quot; constituency &quot; seats will be filled inaccordance with the number of votes received by each party in each con-stituency. Parties present lists in each constituency. Electors may vote for alist or for an individual candidate whose prospects of election are advanced by the size of his personal vote. A further 40 &quot; supplementary &quot; seats will be allotted in such a way as to give each party a total number of seats corres-ponding to its share of the national vote provided this is at least 2 per cent.In addition, the Faroes and Greenland each have two seats.5. Direct Elections: The Government are consulting the Folketing marketcommittee about the main features of a Bill which would provide for electionsbased on a list system, with the whole of Denmark forming one constituencyand Greenland a separate constituency with one seat. At the time of signature of the direct elections instrument the Danish Government obtained the con-currence of the Council of Ministers to two reservations, to permit a compulsorydual mandate and the coincidence of European and their national elections.No decision has yet been taken on whether either or both of these reservationsshould apply.
Italy6. The Italian Chamber of Deputies consists of 630 members elected from32 constituencies with fixed boundaries which return from one to 52 membersdepending on the population of the constituency at the previous census. each party presents a list of candidates. The voter indicates his preference amongparties by crossing out his party&apos;s symbol on the ballot paper. He may alsoexpress a preference for up to three candidates of the party he has chosen (or fourif his constituency is electing 16 or more deputies). He identifies thesecandidates by name or by their numbers on the party list. The list votes areadded up to find each party&apos;s total vote in the constituency. These totals aredivided by the electoral quotient for the constituency and seats allocatedaccordingly. Remainders are transferred to a national pool from whichunassigned seats are distributed. (A party has to elect at least one candidate inone constituency and poll at least 300,000 votes altogether to participate in thisdistribution.)7. The Italian Senate has 315 Members elected by regions. The regionselect from one to 48 senators depending on their population (though there is abias in favour of the smaller regions). The minimum age for voting for the senate is 25, as against 18 for the Chamber, and the minimum age for candidatesis 40, as against 25 for the Chamber. The voting method, and remaindersystem, are similar to those used for the Chamber. In the Senate there are alsofive life Members appointed by the President of the Republic, and formerPresidents of the Republic (two at present) are ex-ofRcio life Members.8. Party allegiance in Italy has been remarkably consistent over the last30 years with overall swings rarely exceeding 3-5 per cent until the regional and national elections of the last two years. There are currently six mainparties having more than 10 seats in the Chamber, five in&quot;the Senate, phis afew splinter groups.9. Direct Elections: Discussion of the electoral arrangements is still atan early stage among the parties, although a ratification Bill has already been passed in the Chamber of Deputies. It appears, however, to be common groundthat the country will be divided into constituencies corresponding to the presentregions, each with its own party lists and electing a number of representativesdepending on population or size of electorate, and that the electoral rules shouldbe modelled on those for the Chamber.Luxembourg10. The Chamber of Deputies consists of 59 Members elected by a systemof proportional representation. For domestic elections the country is dividedinto four constituencies each returning at present six to 24 Members on the basisof one Member per 5,500 inhabitants. Lists of candidates cannot contain morenames than there are seats in the constituency. The elector may vote for a list(in which case it counts as one vote for each candidate on that list) or he maycast his votes individually giving up to two votes for the same candidate and, ifhe wishes, spreading his votes over more than one list. All votes are then addedtogether to give a grand total for each list. Seats are awarded to lists on thebasis of these totals, and the number of votes cast for each candidate determineswhich of them are then declared elected.   On resignation or death a deputy&apos;s
seat is automatically awarded to the unsuccessful candidate on the same listwho polled the next highest personal vote. There are at present five politicalgroups represented in the Luxembourg Chamber of Deputies.11. Direct Elections: A working party has been established and the govern-ment will take its report into consideration when drafting enabling legislation.The proportional representation system will be retained but the question of whether to divide Luxembourg&apos;s six members between two or more constituencesor to have a single national list remains to be decided.Netherlands12. The lower House contains 150 Members. These are in effect electedfrom the whole country as one constituency, but there are 18 voting districts.Any 25 electors within a voting district may nominate a list of candidates.The voter selects one of the lists and marks one only of the candidates on it.The votes cast for candidates of the same party are added up to find the party&apos;total valid vote. Each party is allotted seats in proportion to its national totalof votes on the basis of an electoral quota. Candidates whose votes equal orexceed the quota are elected. Each candidate^ surplus votes over the quotaare transferred to the next candidate on the same list. Unused votes from alllists are allocated in accordance with a complex formula to the parties whichhave obtained the most votes per seat. No party may participate in the share-outof seats unless it has in its total vote reached the electoral quota (i.e. the totalnumber of valid votes divided by the number of seats). This low threshold(0.672 per cent of the total vote) has resulted in a good many minor parties beingrepresented (the last elections held in 1972 produced 14).13. Direct Elections: The Bill to be presented to Parliament later in the year&apos;s  likely on present forecasts to provide for a list system based on a single nationalconstituency, similar to that used in national elections, but the country will notbe divided up into voting districts and the threshold will be higher.The Federal Republic of Germany14. The Bundestag has 496 seats (not including the representatives of west Berlin who can vote only on procedural issues). After the war, electionswere held in the American and French zones on the basis of proportional representation, but in the British zone a compromise was adopted between theproportional and the first-past-the-post system. It is this mixed system whichis now used throughout the Federal Republic. There are 248 single member constituencies and 248 further seats filled from lists put forward by the parties in the individual Laender. The voter has two votes. The first vote is cast foran individual candidate in a constituency (as in a Westminster election) and thesecond for a party list. The 496 seats are divided among the parties in pro-portion to the number of second votes they receive. 248 are filled by the candidates directly elected by the first vote, and the remainder of each party&apos;sentitlement filled from the lists. (Occasionally a party wins more constituencyseats than its total entitlement, in which case it keeps its extra seats and the totalnumber of seats in the Bundestag is increased accordingly.) Constituencycandidates are chosen by the Party organisations in the constituencies, or bygroups of electors: list nominations are all made by the parties. If the candidatewins both on a Land party list and an individual seat, he takes the individual
seat and his name is removed from the party list. The voter may split hisvote by voting for a candidate of a different party from the one whose list hefavours.15. It is the second vote for the party list which decides the composition interms of parties of the Bundestag as a whole. But in order to participate in the share-out of the 248 indirectly elected seats, a party must first secure either, atleast five per cent of the total second vote, or, what is in practice more difficult,three seats in the direct constituency elections. The Free Democrats (Liberals),for instance, who won 39 seats in the 1976 elections, have not won a constituencyseat on the first vote since 1961 but they have always qualified for representationby attaining more than five per cent of the total vote. As a result of the five percent threshold the large parties are slightly over-represented. Since the 1957election no party has obtained an overall majority of seats and government hasbeen by coalition of two of the three party groupings represented in the Bundestag.16. Direct Elections: The parties are currently being consulted on a pre-liminary draft, which provides for elections on the basis of Federal lists with a five per cent qualifying hurdle. There is no provision for individual constituencyrepresentation.  A draft Bill will be introduced into the Bundestag shortly.The Republic of Ireland17. The Dail has 144 seats with 42 constituencies each with 3, 4 or 5 seatselected by single transferable vote. Most candidates are selected by partiesbut there are always a number of independents. To be elected a candidatehas to reach a quota of one vote more than a quarter of the total valid votes ina three-seat constituency, one more than one-fifth in a four-seat constituencyand one more than one-sixth in a five-seat constituency (this is known as theDroop formula). The elector votes by numbering in the order of his preferenceas many of the candidates as he wishes. The voter is thereby indicating wherehis support should go:(a) if the candidate of his first choice has secured more than enough votesfor election, or(b) if his first choice is eliminated during the count.The votes which would not be used to elect anyone either because he alreadyhas sufficient, or because he has been eliminated during the count are thenredistributed amongst other candidates in accordance with the preferencesexpressed by the voters. When the surplus votes have been added or&quot; transferred &quot; to the remaining candidates&apos; original first preference votes,any candidate whose total vote (i.e. first preference vote plus transferred votes)now exceeds the quota is declared elected and his surplus over the quotare-examined for second or third preferences and transferred to the relevantcandidates. Proportional representation was first used in pre-partition ireland in 1919 to encourage participation of the Protestant minority. There are atpresent three parties in the Dail plus three independents.18. Direct Elections: The Irish Government have announced that thedraft legislation under preparation will provide for election by the STV systembased on four regional constituencies, and have published the boundaries ofthe four constituencies proposed.
France19. The National Assembly is elected on a two ballot system from singlemember constituencies, 473 in Metropolitan France and 17 overseas. As inBritish elections, the voter votes directly for the candidate of his choice. the votes cast in the first ballot are counted and if no candidate has secured an absolute majority over all his opponents those candidates who received atleast 121 Per cent of the electoral roll are permitted to go forward to the secondballot one week later. The second ballot is final and a candidate may be elected by a simple or absolute majority. The French two ballot system, likethe British simple majority system, can produce a disproportion between votesand seats.20. The procedure for Presidential elections differs in two respects. Thesecond ballot takes place two weeks after the first: and for that ballot, only thetwo leading candidates may take part.21. Direct Elections: The French Foreign Minister has stated that theGovernment will propose elections by proportional representation on a nationallist system.
LIST SYSTEMINTRODUCTION1. In essence, the list system of election is simple; but over the yearssophisticated variations have been developed in different countries. the primary purpose of a list system is to ensure that total seats won by a political party are proportionate to total votes cast for that party. The main variations in the system relate to the exactness of this proportionality and the extent towhich an elector can vote for named candidates as well as (or instead of) apolitical party.2. One possibility is that the electoral area could be the whole UnitedKingdom and the ballot paper could list only the political parties. The votesfor each party would be totalled nationally and the 81 United Kingdom seatswould be allocated to each party according to a formula. In principle, a partyobtaining 25 per cent of the total votes cast should be allocated 25 per cent ofthe seats (either 20 or 21 seats depending on the formula). In this system, the individuals to take these seats would be drawn from the (published) list of candidates drawn up by the political party in the order listed there. Electorswould have no direct say in this choice. Each political party could drawsupport from all parts of the United Kingdom; for example, supporters of scottish, Northern Irish or Welsh parties living in London could vote for theparty of their choice.A REGIONAL LIST SYSTEM3. A regional list system might be preferable to a national list system, andwould allow some of the virtues of the simple majority system to be retained.Regional feeling and identification is a recognisable factor in England, andmany of the issues discussed in the European Assembly have as much significancefor a region in England as for a European constituency. With a regional listof candidates, individual candidates are more likely to be known to the voterthan with a national list. There would also appear to be more scope forinvolving existing Westminster constituency organisations in the selectionprocess.   The following paragraphs deal with a regional list system.
ELECTORAL AREAS4. The United Kingdom would be divided into a number of electoralareas: Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would each constitute a separatearea; England could be divided on the basis of existing economic planningregions, but the GLC area might be separated from the South East planningregion and East Anglia combined with the East Midlands. The number of seats for each region would be allocated on the basis of electorate. As an example, the seats might be allocated under this system as follows: Electoral Area	SeatsScotland       ..................	8Wales.....................	4Northern Ireland     ...............	3South-East England (excluding Greater London) ...	14Greater London      ...............	10South-West England         ............	6East Anglia and East Midlands     .........	8West Midlands        ...............	north-West England...............	9Yorkshire and Humberside............	7Northern England    ...............	5
Voting Procedure5. The ballot paper in a regional list system might show the names (inalphabetical order) of individual candidates with their party affiliations, if any.This procedure would enable the elector to express preferences between individual -dual candidates as well as between parties. Individual identification of the votes with a particular candidate is one of the strengths of the simple majoritysystem that can be retained in a regional list system. The ballot paper wouldcontain more names than is usual at Parliamentary elections. In the North-West England region for example, with 9 seats, there might be 3 parties putting forward 9 candidates each, with 3 other parties putting forward say 2 candidateseach.   The ballot paper would thus contain 33 names.Candidates6. The parties would have to develop procedures for selecting theircandidates. Some form of registration of political parties might be necessary if the list system used party rather than individual candidate names. Inde-pendent candidates could be permitted to stand for election provided that theyhad nominations from the prescribed number of electors.Nominations and Deposit7. Suitable provision would be needed for nominations. The require-ments might have to be more stringent than for parliamentary elections,especially if it were thought inappropriate to require a deposit on the grounds that candidates would sometimes be elected on the basis of the aggregate votescast for members of their party rather than the votes cast for them personally.Mid-term Vacancies8. It should normally be possible to fill vacancies, without holding by-elections, by allotting the seat to the candidate who secured the next highesttotal of votes for his party in the region. If no such candidate remained, then it might be sufficient to permit the party to whom the retiring member belongsto co-opt a successor.Cost9. A list system would probably cost much the same to run as a simple majority system. The main administrative costs in both would relate topostage and to polling and counting arrangements.Information10. A list system would be new to the United Kingdom and there would need to be a reasonable period of time for the political parties, candidatesand electors to learn about the workings of the new system. Information andtraining would also probably be needed for the local authority staffs whowould be responsible for conducting the poll and the count. This factor wouldhave to be taken into account in the timetable for the election.
Counting and Allocation of Seats11. Each elector could have one vote which he would cast for a namedcandidate. The total votes cast for all the candidates of each party would be calculated, and the parties would be allotted seats in proportion to their totalshare of the poll. Thus, in a 4-seat region, a party gaining \ of the total voteswould be allocated one seat. This seat would go to the named candidate of that party who had received the most individual votes. It would be necessary to devise a formula for allocating the odd seats remaining after the first allocation;a number of different formulae are used in other countries.
SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTEIntroduction1. The single transferable vote (STV) system of proportional representa-tion involves the use of multi-member constituencies. In this system, account is taken not only of the voter&apos;s first choice of a candidate but also of his second and subsequent preferences. The voter marks on his ballot paper his order ofpreference (1, 2, 3, etc) for all the candidates named on the ballot paper. Bydoing so, he is indicating where his support should go if either the candidate of his first choice has already secured enough votes for election,or his first choice is eliminated because he has secured too few votes to stand any chance of election.2. The STV system is used in the Republic of Ireland, Australia (elections to the Senate) and in local elections in Northern Ireland. Such matters as the exact means of calculating the electoral quota and the procedure for redistribut-ing surplus and other votes may vary according to the precise system selected.Constituencies always return at least three members.Electoral Areas3. For European Assembly elections, Wales and Northern Ireland couldeach constitute a single constituency; Scotland could comprise one or more.In England, the constituencies could be formed on the basis of the economic planning regions (although some modifications would probably have to bemade to the South East economic planning region, whose electorate wouldentitle it to about 24 members).Voting Procedure4. As with our system of parliamentary elections, the ballot paper wouldlist candidates in alphabetical order (with their party affiliations, if any). Thevoter would then mark the names of the candidates in his order of preference(i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc, for as many names as he wishes, up to the limit of the numberof names appearing on the ballot paper).Candidates5. The arrangements for the selection of candidates would be similar tothose under a simple majority system. Independent candidates would be permitted to stand provided that they were nominated by the prescribed numberof electors and could meet the necessary deposit.Nominations and Deposit6. Suitable provision would be needed for nominations and deposit.In the Republic of Ireland, a candidate loses his deposit if he fails to secureone-third of the quota at any stage. In the Northern Ireland Assembly andConvention elections, the deposit was lost if the candidate did not secureone-quarter of the quota at any stage.
Mid-term Vacancies7. Vacancies arising between general elections may be filled in one of threeways. The first involves a by-election using the STV system as described above.The member thus elected is elected with an absolute majority of votes.Alternatively, the ballot papers cast at the general election for the retiringmember may be re-examined and allocated to the other candidates in accordancewith the next available preferences of the voters. Or the vacancy could be filled by co-option from the party represented by the retiring member.cost. STV would probably cost much the same to run as a simple majoritysystem. The main administrative costs in both would relate to postage and topolling and counting arrangements.Information9. STV would be new to most people in the United Kingdom, and therewould need to be a reasonable period of time for the political parties, candidatesand electors to learn about the workings of the new system. Information andtraining would also probably be needed for the local authority staffs who wouldbe responsible for conducting the poll and the count. This factor would haveto be taken into account in the timetable for the election.Counting and Allocation of Seats10. The returning officer determines the number of valid first preferencevotes cast for each candidate. An electoral quota is established by first dividing the number of valid ballot papers by the number of members to be elected plusone. One is then added to produce the quota. Anyone whose total of validfirst preference votes exceeds the quota is declared elected.11. If vacancies remain, the number of votes by which an elected candidatehas exceeded the quota is transfened to the candidates who have not yet been declared elected. The transfer is made in accordance with the second or(if the candidate of the voter&apos;s next choice has already exceeded the quota)subsequent preferences shown on the ballot papers. For this purpose allthe ballot papers cast for a successful candidate are examined in order todetermine the proportions in which his surplus votes should be transferred tothe as yet unelected candidates.12. If a transfer of surplus votes brings the total of votes cast for othercandidates above the electoral quota, they in turn are declared elected. Theirsurplus votes are then, if vacancies remain, transferred to the remainingcandidates. The transfer is made according to the proportion of next preferencesshown by the transferred ballot papers which brought them up to or over the quota (i.e. the candidates&apos; original first preference votes are not taken intoaccount).13. If, after all surpluses of successful candidates have been transferred,there remain vacancies but none of the remaining candidates is up to or overthe quota, the candidate who at that stage has the lowest vote is eliminated.His votes are transferred to the remaining unelected candidates in accordance
with the next available preferences shown. Anyone who is brought up to or over the quota after the elimination of the lowest candidate is declared electedand his surplus, if any, is transferred as described in paragraph 12 above.If no-one is brought up to the quota, the candidate with the next lowest total of votes is excluded and his votes transferred. The process of transferringsurpluses or eliminating the lowest candidate as appropriate is continued untilall the vacant seats are filled.14. Recounts may be demanded of each stage of the count as described in the preceding paragraphs. The request for a recount must be made afterthe completion of the stage whose recount is demanded but before the com-mencement of the next stage. No recount is permitted of the count as a wholein Northern Ireland elections.15. The actual mechanics of the STV count are similar to those used ina UK parliamentary election: votes are sorted according to the voters&apos;preferences and the preferences thus sorted are counted. But this sorting andcounting takes place several times during the proceedings rather than justonce (or twice or more if there are recounts).
COMPULSORY DUAL MANDATEIntroduction1. A compulsory dual mandate can in principle be operated with anyelectoral system. It would mean that membership of the House of commons would be an essential condition for membership of the European Assembly.Advantages2. A compulsory dual mandate would ensure that United KingdomAssembly members had as their primary base their position at Westminster andin their Westminster constituencies; it would minimise the risk of divergenciesbetween Assembly members and other Westminster members of the sameparty; and it would discourage the development in Britain of European partieswith federalist aims which might undermine the position of our nationalparties.Disadvantages3. A compulsory dual mandate would impose considerable strain onAssembly members. They would be less able to play their full roles at westminster and in the Assembly than other members of either body, particu-larly if they represented remote constituencies. Since Westminster elections and Assembly elections would not normally coincide, problems would arise when MPs lost their seats at Westminster and were thus disqualified from membership of the Assembly.Practical considerations . Apart from possible changes in the arrangement of parliamentary business, changes in voting arrangements would be needed. One possibility would be to introduce proxy voting. At Westminster this would involve formal recognition that Assembly members&apos; votes were being cast without their havingparticipated in debates, and would disturb long established conventions.It might be a less significant innovation in a newly elected Assembly althoughother member States which were not operating a compulsory dual mandatemight not feel the need for such a procedure. An alternative possibility wouldbe automatic pairing at Westminster of Assembly members.General5. A dual mandate combined with our traditional electoral system wouldrequire candidates from the House of Commons to stand for each of the81 seats. This might be difficult especially for the party forming the Govern-ment, which also has to provide Ministers. Under a system of multi-member constituencies there would be greater flexibility in finding sufficient candidatesto fill the 81 seats. Assembly members who lost their Westminster seats wouldbe disqualified and would need to be replaced by selection from a list or by holding by-elections, depending on the choice of electoral system. BothAssembly and national elections would be likely to result in significant changesin United Kingdom representation in the Assembly.Printed in England by Oyez Press Limited, and published by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery OfficeDdl61836  K48   3/77
