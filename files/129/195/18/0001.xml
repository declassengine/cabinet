DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(77) 43COPY NO2 May 1977 g VCABINETGUARANTEED PRICE FOR MILKMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and food. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary has reported (in cp(77) 42) that we were not able to reach agreement in the ministerial committee on European Questions (CQM) on the level of the guaranteed price for milk for the period April-December 1977.2. This is without doubt the most important single agricultural decisionof the year.    Milk at present accounts for over 20 per cent of our agricultural production and is at the heart of the expansion programme weoutlined in &quot;Food from our own Resources&quot; (Cmnd 6020).     We at presentspend a massive  500 million per annum on importing milk products;  wecould save a high proportion of this by expanding our own production.3. But farmers will only expand production if they can see that it will beprofitable for them to do so and if they have confidence in the future.    In myjudgmentj 48 pence per gallon is the figure necessary to be sure ofsecuring the expansion we have said we want.    If all goes well duiing theyear, we might still get some expansion with 47 pence per gallon;  atanything less we should be risking a long-term setback to the dairy industryand would be quite unable to maintain public credibility in our overallagricultural policy.4. Since I put in my paper to CQM, another very important figure hasbecome available.    I earlier drew attention to the fact that the number ofdairy heifers in calf was 11 per cent down at the December census;  we nowknow that the figure for March shows a 14.4 per cent decline.    Theseanimals represent the next generation of cows and are thus a vital indicatorof the level of confidence in the industry;    this is the biggest declineexperienced for over a decade and it speaks for itself.5. Unless, therefore, we make an increase in the guarnateed pricesufficient to restore profitability and confidence, we shall be in real dangerof another 1974 situation.    Then, cows were slaughtered on a major scale and it took massive increases in the guaranteed price - totalling10 pence per gallon (worth 13 pence per gallon in current terms) within8 months - to reverse the process.rn ki ci pic ki ti a i
RETAIL PRICES6. I accept that the timing and extent of retail milk price increases isan important issue in prosent circumstances.    But I should emphasise that,had it not been for the decision to bring the subsidy to an end, we shouldnot have needed any retail price increase before the end of the year to finance even 48 pence per gallon;   as it is, the subsidy decision alone wouldmean another increase of lp per pint during the summer.    However, I am prepared to accept 47 pence per gallon, and the risks to our agricultural policy which this involves, in order to ease the retail price effects.MY proposals. In order to finance 47 pence per gallon I would propose the following:-ljr p on 22 May        (ie the earliest practicable date, involving anannouncement by 8 May);    andIP in mid-OctoberIn announcing these increases, we could say that there would be no need forany further retail price increases during the remainder of the agriculturalyear.J S ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food2 May 1977
