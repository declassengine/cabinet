DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government.)CP(77) 40 COPY NO29 April 1977CABINETGOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE LAYFIELD REPORT on local GOVERNMENT FINANCENote by the Secretary of State for the Home department. In June 1974 the late Secretary of State for the Environmentannounced the setting up of a Committee to review the whole system of localgovernment finance in England, Scotland and Wales.    The committee reported in March 1976, and their report (Cmnd 6453) was published inMay 1976.    At the time of publication the Secretary of State for the environment announced in a Parliamentary statement (Hansard, 19 May 1976,cols. 1415-1416) that the Government were anxious to consult fully with thelocal authorities and with public and professional opinion generally, and asked for comments to be submitted by the end of November.    He said thatthe Government would aim to come to decisions and to report to the Houseas soon as possible thereafter.2. Since the middle of last year a group of Ministers under my chairmanship has been considering what the Government&apos;s response to theLayfield proposals should be, and their agreed conclusions have now beenembodied in the draft Green Paper annexed to this note.3. The Layfield Report itself contained no single, clear-cut list of recommendations, but rather a fundamental analysis of the system oflocal government finance, recognising that the financial system must depend on the view taken of what the total relationship between centralgovernment and local authorities should be.    The main Report identifiedtwo broad possible approaches - &quot;centralist&quot; and &quot;localist&quot;;  but a minorityfavoured the adoption of a &quot;middle way&quot; in which the Government would setminimum standards which local authorities would be required to meetleaving them free to do more if they wished.    The Ministerial Group alsofavours steering a middle course between the extremes of &quot;centralism&apos;and &quot;localism1, not in the same terms as the minority report, but seeingrelations with the local authorities as a partnership in which financialinstruments can be designed to allow the Government influence in localaffairs where national priorities demand it, but otherwise preserve localautonomy.1
4. In the light of this we have looked at each of the main issues raisedby Layfield and have sought to formulate a Government response.    But inmatters of such far-reaching importance we feel that even now, twelve monthsafter the publication of Layfield, the Government should on some issues onlyput out tentative views which may be modified in the course of furtherpublic discussion and debate, particularly of course with the localauthorities and their associations.    Hence the proposal for a Green,rather than a White, Paper - although on some matters we propose a firm Government line.5. The conclusions are summarised in Section 9 of the Paper.    Themain issues of political interest to which I would draw Cabinet&apos;s attentionare:i. The Government sees its relationship with the localauthorities as one of collaboration and partner ship, to take asfull account as possible of both local democracy and nationalpriorities.ii. Local rates should continue to be levied.    No other source of local revenue provides a practical alternative.    In particular wereject the proposal for a local income tax.iii. The bulk of Exchequer support should continue to be by wayof a block grant;  but the present rate support grant might bereplaced by a unitary grant which would promote a fairerdistribution among authorities and accountability to localelectorates, and should lead to improved Government influence over local spending.iv. There should be a continuing role for specific grants, butthe scope of any new ones should be discussed with the localauthorities before they are introduced.v. A new system of capital expenditure approvals - byprogramme rather than by project - will be discussed with thelocal authority associations.vi. Audit arrangements will be improved to help secure bettervalue for money.vii. Domestic property will, from the next valuation (1982-83at earliest), be rated on the basis of its capital value instead of ona notional rental value.viii. Agricultural land (contrary to the Layfield recommendation)should not be re-rated.2
5. I invite Cabinet to approve the draft Green Paper, with a view toits publication in the course of May.6. This Green Paper covers only England and Wales.    A paralleldocument covering Scotland, wholly consistent with this paper, but modified to take account of certain differences in the Scottish situation, will be cleared with Cabinet members in correspondence and published on thesame day.M RHome Office29 April 19773

1 *        IHIRODUC t I 0 N1*1.     The finances of local authorities came under severe pressure in 1574/75*The re-structurlng of local&quot;government and a change in the basis of thedistribution of the rate support grant coincided with a surgs in inflation,   Earlyin the year many local authorities announced record increases in their ratepoundages.   The Government acted quickly to mitigate the effects of the3o increasesi cn householders by introducing a scheme of special domestic rate reliefs   But thi3could only be a short term measure.   The difficulties focussed attention on thewhole basis of local government finance - it3 organisation, the distribution of central government grant, the revenue raising powers of local government, the rating system, levels or rates, quality of services provided and, perhaps mostimportant of all, the relationship between central and local government.1 .2.     Local government had been reorganised by the previous administration.   Butthi3 was not accompanied by any major amendments to the financial system.The time was, therefore, clearly opportune for a review of all aspects of localgovernment finance.   A Committee of Inquiry (referred to 83 &quot;the Committee&quot; inthe remainder of this document) were appointed in the summer of 1974, under theChairmanship of Mr (now Sir) Prank Layfield QC.   Their terms of reference were ...&apos;to review the whole system of local government finance in England, Scotland and(-\ )Wales, and to make recommendations&apos;The Committee&apos;3 ReportN-/ was published inMay 1976.1*3*     The Committee faced a formidable task.   They were conducting the firstcomprehensive review of local government finance since 1914*   Local authoritiesprovide a wide range of important services, including education, personal social services, housing, rondo, police etc.   In 1975/76 local government spent some 15,000 million, it had a capital debt of  23,000 million and employed over two(2)and a half million people.   The Committee received evidencev &apos; from over a thousandorganisations and individuals.   The Government are grateful to them for all theirhard work.1 *4.

authority associations,&apos; other interested bodie-3 and the public generally.Green Paper sets out the Governments initial conclusions on the main issuescovered by the Committee, but many detailed points have yet to be considered.This Green Paper will form the basis for the next round of consultations.   0n sCT     4-hSHsubjects there is widespread agreement on the changes that are required.   I11osaas the Government wake specific proposals for action.   Where legislation isrequired, it will be introduced in due course.   On other subjects, however,views differ and further development work is needed.   In these cases, theGovernment&apos;s general approach is outlined.   Discussions will start immediatelywith the local authority associations with a view to translating this general approach into specific pi*op03als.1.5* The analysis and the proposals in this paper relate generally to England   ^and Wales; a separate statement will be made on Scotland.   The detailed apP-^08to Wales will need to be considered in the light of the implementation of theGovernment  policy on devolution and the need to consult the Welsh Assembly&apos;

The dilemma which faaes centra]government is to soupro and promote an effective local democracy with genuinepolitical choice and at the same time fulfil their responsibilities for themanagement of the economy and for the standards of public aerviceo.2.2.     Because of thair responsibilities for tho management of the economy centragovernment must concern themselves with total local government expenditure andtaxation.   They also hare responsibility for the development of policy for particular service a.   Central governments role is therefore:-      to ensure that the local services (education, personal social services, housing etc) reflect national priorities and national policies and are provided at broadly comparable standards^to ensure that, In aggregate, local governments spending plans are compatible with the Government S economic objectives;to ensure -hat activities of one authority do nob havs adverse effects on the area of another;to promote co-operation between local authority and othercomplementary services;to ensure that the financial arrangements promote efficiency;to safeguard the interests of vulnerable minority groups whoseinterests may only got a proper hearing at national level;-      and to encourage and maintain local democracy.2.3*     Local government are responsible for the provision of services locally.Their role is;f *rfj fr* f * *-:*-** rs% c-
&quot;      to provide servicsa to mc^-c local needs enj preferences,,&quot;      to provide sow less in accordance with the statutory dutieslaid down by Parliament and national Priorities/to promote greater administrative efficiency - another levelof government enables the responsibility fov local-decisions to bo decentralised;to provide initiatives leading to the formulation of new policies;and to operate and develop democracy at the local levels.%2^ .^ y*.s11?&quot;en control and local government2c4*     Tfi-j Committee took the view that the absence of any explicitly establishedview of the relationship between central and local government leads to confusionever where the real responsibilityScv local expenditure rests.   It was, thereforesssntial to redefine and clarify the relationship, fcnd they put forward two baasfor doing so.   They proposed either a system of responsibilities which franklyrecognised the need fcr strong central intervention - the centrali?-i approach -or that positive steps should be taken to increase the freedom of localauthorities to manage their own affairs - the loaaliat approacn.2.5.     A centralist approach would, at least, involve central govei*nment in directcontrols on the revenue and capital spending of each local authority.    It wouldrequire a substantial increase in the manpower of central government to scrutiniselocal authority budgets, and involve the Government in a great number of detaileddecisions affecting the expenditure cf individual authorities.   The scope for decisions to be taken locally would be diminished.2.6*     A localist approach would mean much greater responsibility for localauthorities including more p0V;ers of decision in services such as education,social services, transport and housing and the limitation of Government    ..responsibilities to its concern with the management of the economy.    this approach, the Committee said, .y/ould need to be accompanied by a lessening of    -
dependence on national taxation as a means of financing local services.   TheCommittee therefore proposed the introduction of a Local Income Tax (LIT).   Thiswas not to replace, but to supplement, the existing property rate system.Accountability would be promoted because control over local spending would beexercised largely by the local authority.   But, the Committee stressed, theGovernment would need to have at their disposal some form, of &quot;regulator&quot; whichcould be applied in order to encourage local authorities to keep their expenditure,current and capital, in line with the Government*s policies.   The localistapproach would involve a surrender by the Government of a large part of theirpx&apos;esent influence over local services.2.7.     A minority of the Committee rejected these alternatives and suggestedinstead a middle way, in which the Government would set minimum standards which local authorities would be required to meet, leaving them free to provide higher standards if they wished.Government View2.3.     The Government accept-that the dividing line between central and localresponsibilities is not always clear.   There are many reasons for this.   Thecentral/local relationship is changing all the time because national economicand social priorities can alter substantially even within quite short periods.It is not long for &quot;example, since government policy encoui*aged rapid expansion in local services.   Subsequent developments in the economy have meant restrictionson the growth of public expenditure in general and in the local government sector inparticular, including  measures such as the restraint of local transport expenditure,limitations on the number of police civilian supporting staff and traffic v/gardens,and the reordering of priorities in the personal social, services between thevarious client groups and the various methods of provision.   Nevertheless, thechange in emphasis in the relative responsibilities of central and localgovernment remains compatible with, a well undarstood and accepted constitutionalrelationship.   Any formal definition of central and local responsibilities wouldlack the advantages of flexibility and rapidity of response to new circumstances.It would be likely to break down under the pressure of events.   The Government*view is, therefore, that while clarification of responsibility wherever practicable is desirable, a fundamental redefinition i3 not necessary f,3 a basis for solving the problems of local government finance.   The disadvantages ofboth the centralist and localist approaches arc clear, and the Government does hotthink there is a case for tho adoption of either.i sviv i L.V L/ J
^KES I KIC i EDj2.5J.     The Government think that the minority of the Committee were right toemphasise the imporcanoe of seeking a middle, way.   But their particular solution is, in the Government&apos;a view, impractical.   It is unrealistic to envisagedeveloping a middle way which reduces the whole relationship between local and central government to a simply defined form of allocation of responsibilities.Rather the Government see the duties and responsibilities involved in the proviai0^of local public services as   being shared on a partnership basis between centrala&apos;ne local government.   Within this framework the balance of responsibilities will vary over time as circumstances change.Government proposals.10.   But if both parties are to fulfil their respective roles the government believe that the present arrangements need improvement.   They recosniae that therespective roles of central and local government could and should be clarified i11relation to new policies on individual services.   This does not mesn that therelationships would remain unaltered but that both parties would have a cleareridea of how a new policy will affect their respective roles.   The Government pi&quot;0?&quot;therefore that when n-ow policy-initiatives are taker, on a service,  the relaticr--^&apos;between central and local government in carrying out that policy initiative sh0^be set out as clearly aa possible.2.11.   The Government believe that the general shape and content of the present financial arrangements are capable - with some significant modifications - of 8***texpression to a middle way approach in which a substantial, degree of local autCis preserved ana in which central government&apos;s economic responsibilities and?0&apos;&apos;&apos;1interests in local services can be reflected.   This approach can be.achieved by continuing and developing as the principal form of Exchequer support, a block recommendation^which, in supporting the coats of local services, onabiea local authorities to order their own priorities.   There will be a continued need for other grantsrelation to individual services and for some form cf control over capitalexpenditure.2.12.

HI.    TH5 FUNCTIONS OF RATE SUPPORT GRANT AND POSSIBLE CHAJKGSS IN T;I3 SYSTEM3*1 *     Exchequer grants make a contribution to the cost of local government f?oalcentral taxation and reduce   the burden that would otherwise fall wholly on,     ginratepayers.   Nationally, the Exchequer contributes at present, through grants,for every  1 of local authority expenditure.   The major form of support,     therate support grant (RSG), compensates for the differences between authorities intheir relative spending needs (for example some authorities may have a relative ^high proportion of schoolchildren) and in their taxable resources (ie&apos; the produota 1p rate varies widely from one area to another).   RSG distribution aim3 to eventhese differences so that ratepayers generally are put on a comparable footingwherever they live.   Government decisions about the total amount of RSG, and heBflabout the balance to be collected from ratepayers, clearly have an important influence on the aggregate of local authority revenue expenditure.   Decisionsthe distribution of RSG total from one year- to another have a significant impacon the financial position of the&quot; individual authority and on rate bill.5.3.1A.   The prssent RSG system was introduced in 1966 and modified in 1974*contains significant advantages over what went before in that it introduced the concept of compensation for differences in spending needs and allowed greatercompensation for differences in taxable resources.   However it contains drawD*0y2.     The RSG- mechanism enables the Government to influence total local eXPeT1but only in a non-selective, across-the-board way.   Second, the allocation ot pindividual authorities ha3 to be based on an assessment of relative spending neSthe present method of assessment is much criticised.   Third, the grant systemnot fully compensate for differences between authorities in their relative *earateable value.   Some authorities which are particularly rich in rateable res^are able to levy a lower rate poundage than comparable authorities providing 5    jlevels of service or, for the same rate poundage^to provide a higher level 0? 5*to their ratepayers.   Fourth, the arrangements do not readily enable ratepayc;understand the way the expenditure of their local authority is to be financed.-    h   ave^3.3.     Tha Government consider that these drawbacks should if possible be 0      eThey therefore propose to discuss with the local authority associations *for improvements in the financial arrangements based on the only two possi&quot;    ^jhich are evident; first, continuing with the present grant arrange;- ents w1 *   ^improvements as the structure allows aud., second, the introduction of a rieT*ts8&apos;Sstructure on the lines of the unitary grant proposal discussed in the Concn1     preport.

restricted)        ,0 ,w.,-,-^^-^^^-^^^ 29 April3*4*     The basis on which central government grant is distributed is not ofinterest solely to local authorities.   It affects the level of rate poundages andthe standard of local services.   It is therefore of direct interest to allratepayers and consumers of local services.   The Government, therefore, believe it important that there should be a wider debate about the strengths and weaknessesof the present system which should involve not only the representative organisations but individual local authorities and the public.   The rest of thissection, therefore, describes briefly the features of both the present R3G and fieunitary grant system.Rate Support Grant3.5.     The rate support grant total is decided annually by Government inconsultation with the local authority associations.   The RSG comprises threeelements - resources, needs and domestic   The resources element compensatesauthorities for the amount by which their  rateable value per head fallsbelow a specified national standard rateable value per head.   Those authorities whose*rateable v slue per head is above the national standard do not receive resourceselement.   The needs element compensates for differences between authorities in theamount per head they need to spend.   The objective is, through the combined effectof the resources and need.3 elements, to enable individual authorities providingsimilar standards of service to levy similar rates in the pound whatever theirspending needs and rateable resources.   The domestic element compensates localauthorities for the specified rate poundage redaction v,hich they are required bythe Government to give to all domestic ratepayers.Unitary Grant3.6.     A unitary grant system would similarly be based on the principle ofcompensating for differences in relative needs and in rateable resources.   But itwould do this by one grant element.      Domestic element couldremain as a separate feature.   The grant allocation to each authority would be theamount which would enable each authority to provide overall levels of servicecomparable with other authorities, if it levied a specified standard ratePoundage.   In its simplest form, a unitary grant would giveeach authority the aiuount it needed to bridge the gap between:(a)   the total amount it needed to spend (however assessed) toprovide a level of service comparable with other similarauthorities; and
(b)   the amount it could raise in rates from it3 own rateable value if it fixed its rate poundage at the specified level.If an authority wished to spend more than its assessed need, it could do 30.But as an incentive to conform to the figure of assessed spending need, it wouldbe open to the Government to pay grant on additional expenditure but at a reduced rate.   The authority would then have to finance a higher proportion of the extra expenditure from the rates. Ths principles cf a unitary grant system are outli118^Appendix I.The Influence of RSG and Unitary Grant or. Expenditure3*1*     Over the post-war period, a much wider range of responsibilities and obligations has been laid or. local government, by Act3 of Parliament, and suocflGovernments have encouraged local authorities to expand their services consj-deI&quot;aAs a result, local authority expenditure now represents 30% of total public spending and \3% of gross national product.   Control of the total of localauthority expenditure has therefore become a matter of greater importance toGovernment in th9.tr management of .the economy.   New legislation can have a significant effect in adding to. the demands for additional local spending,the main ways in which the Government seek to influence the total of local expenditure are through the issue of guidance on the development of servictthe settlement of the level of RSG.3.8. - The degree to which the Government can press their views of an aPProplevel of total local expenditure 3.3 inextricably linked with the issue cf ^oCautonomy.    There are sona who argue in our present economic climate that *hflGovernment should take powers to control directly the level of spendingcash limits on the total expenditure of nil local authorities (ie not juston the level of Exchequer support) or by setting a maximum permissible percsnlimit on rate increases.   These would be blunt instruments of control, and th6^would seriously undermine local autonomy.3.9*     Policy guidance about the total of expenditure that can be afforded 1nt 0tho local government sector and about national, priorities in the develop016individual services has beon an effective means of obtaining the co-opera^local authorities on expenditure plans. Such policy guidance, however, h&quot;-3two defects.   First, unless the guidance in in very general terms, it can i*v.,rthe Government in expressing via-,,3 about the detailed priorities within *r\c v 1 r\iv a su. w
iestricted29   Aprilservices.   The second, and conflicting, difficulty is that guidance in very general terms may convey no clear meaning to an individual authority;    even detailedPolicy guidance cannot be framed so as to be equally apt to the widely differingcircumstances of all individual authorities.3.1C.   Under the present grant system, whenever it is necessary to discouragespending, Government can reduce the share of total local authority expenditure which they finance through grant.   If local government do not reduce their expenditure by an equivalent amount, the reduction in Government grant has to beffiet by ratepayers.   The disadvantage is that individual local authorities suffera reduction in grant which is unrelated to whether they have followed Governmentguidance on expenditure levels and. which cannot, by its very nature, take accountof all local circumstances.3.11.   The Government believe that more effective influence should be obtainedQver total local expenditure by revised financial arrangements which are clear inPurpose, selective and fair in application and which impose their ovm disciplinewith a minimum of obtrusive guidance and exhortation fr&amp;a the government,^dividual authorities and their electors should be able to see more clearlyth-e implications of what can be afforded in the country as a whole for the levelOf their expenditure locally.   Thus, the financial arrangements influencing the totalspending of the h-yi local authorities must reflect the wide variations in theircircumstances.   At the same time the Government are concerned to ensure thati&amp;dividual authorities retain some freedom to determine their total spendingb^dgets as well as to decide priorities within their budgets.5*12.   To discourage spending under a unitary grant system it would not be necessary*o impose an across-the-board reduction in grant percentage with the consequentgeneral increases in rate bills.   Instead, the affect would be that the increase*n rate bills would apply only to the ratepayers of authorities which arepending.beyond their share of the total spending planned for local*uthorities as a whole.   The Government would not wish to restrain unnecessarilydiscretion of individual authorities to determine their own spending levels.the unitary grant system v/ould give authorities an incentive to weightfceir higher expenditure plans against the need to keep total local authority spending
29 Aprilwithin the nationally-planned total.   Authorities spending more than their guidelinamounts would have to charge their ratepayers a progressively higher rate pounda e*In that way, authorities choosing to spend more would probably get some extragrant but their extra spending would be financed increasingly by the authority 8ratepayers and less by the Government.3.13.   Because the regulatory feature of the grant arrangements would be explic^and built into the grant system distribution arrangements, authorities wouldknow where they stood when preparing their budgets.    Such an arrangement wouldhave advantages over the taking of ad hoc powers, after the event, to discrimm^against &quot;overspending1 authorities - as the Government have been pressed todo over the la::;t 12 months.The role of assessed expenditure need .1^.   The assessment of relative spending need is a crucial component of anygrant system.   Many local authorities are critical of the present method ofassessing need.   The Government regard it as essential to use the best methodpossible, and that this should be selected only after a careful review of the alternatives.   The Government will,  therefore, as a matter of urgency, explarealternative methods with trie local authority associations.   The drawbacks of thepresent method, and possible alternative methods, are discussed in Appendix H*3.15.   Under the present system the spending need assessments are not publishedthey are implicit in the formula which is used for distributing the needs elemeof RSG.   A necessary feature of a unitary grant system would be the publicationof the assessments of spending need for each authority.    Authorities would be free to spend above their assessed spending need - Government would not be dicb-&quot;to the local authorities what their spending level must be,     The assessments ^be expressed as a range within which the basis of the grant allocation for each authority would remain unaltered.   Furthermore, in making the expenditureassessments some weight could be given to the existing level of expenditure 0^each authority.3.l6.    It has been suggested that greater weight is placed on assessment of nee(*under unitary grant than under RSG, and that this is an undesirable feature wfiethe methods of assessing need are open to so much question.   In fact, unitarjthewould give Government the oution of deciding what weight would be nlaced on wthe *efigure of relative spendxnp; need:    the less reliable it was thought to be, W1ne consequents 1 incre/se In-Jpoundare for ^y&apos;at&apos;nr?Nii it
ps^   ftm wgtti ps^   j; a^jas paw jjS     s    * B i     La  IL*Ecualiaatiop3*17*   The grant system can promote equity in the treatment of ratepayers indifferent areas, so that ratepayers wherever they live pay the same rate bill if their property has the same rateable value and their local authorities providecomparable overall levels of services.3.18.   In the existing grant system the needs and resources elements work togetherso that in most areas a comparable overall standard of service can be provided with a similar rate poundage   However in the present system some authorities are left with an advantage in terms of rateable resources.   But if the needs and resources of all local authorities were brought up to the level cf the richestauthorities, grant would have to meet nearly all of local government expenditure(instead of the present 61$).*3.1 Si   By oombining the two separate needs and resources elements of the RSC intoa single payment, a unitary grant system would enable similar rate poundages tobe levied for similar levels of service.   If, as a result, changes in rateburdens were severe, it would-be possible to temper the incidence of changes bytransitional, or other arrangements.   The important feature of such arrangements would ba that there would still be a much clearer and more comprehensible account to ratepayers than the present system.3*20.   However there is some controversy whether the principle of equal ratePoundages for equal service levels is  the right one.   The Committee considered that because of differences in the rateable value of domestic properties of similar type,sise and quality, equalisation should be related to an area&apos;s total personal incomerather then to its total rateable value.   They therefore recommended that the aimQf the grant distribution should be to make the proportion of aggregate income taken&quot;7 domestic rates in each local authority area the same, assuming similar standards0f service.3*21.   There are strong objections to this proposal.   Domestic rate bills wouldbecome an amalgam of two different bases of taxation which would compromise the U3eof occupation of domestic property as a valid basis for taxation in its own right.It would be complex to administer and involve the collection of data on personalincome for each local authority area.   Ratepayers would find it much moredifficult to 3ee the link between their authority&apos;s level of expenditure and its
25 APrilrate poundage.   Nor could they quo hot? the rate poundage compared with ttfat OAauthorities.   Moreover, because only the aggregate of personal incomes in each authority would be taken into account, the effect would be to inoreasa the rataburdens of people with below average incomes living in local authorities whoseaggregate income wa3 above the average: it would also reduce the rate burden 0?people with above average incomes living in local authorities whose aggregate inCa in 01waS below the average.   More than a third of all ratepayers might be affecteaor other of these ways; both affects would be contrary to the Committee&apos;s obj^c&apos;&apos;of taking account of the personal incomes of domestic ratepayers.   The Govern^1&apos;do not therefore propose to pursue thi3 recommendation.3.22.   Variations in rate bills for comparable domestic properties in diffGren*part3 of the country are partly attributable to differences in rateable valu03&apos;The Government&apos;s proposals discussed in Section VI for the adoption of c&amp;V^ valuation -will go some way to reducing these variations in rate bills.Ac c ountfib ility3.23*     local authorities are already accountable to their electorates bscous8Oftare responsible far the way in- which local needs are met and priorities are oiand for the level of rate poundages.   The fact that a substantial part of lo58*authority services is financed by Government grant,- as opposed to locally ?**revenue, does not necessarily reduce local authorities&apos; accountability.   &apos;&quot;osExchequer support is a block grant, which is not ear-marked by the Goveitimen&quot;particular service, and local authorities are free to order their own spendiWpriorities within the framework of legislation,3*24*   The Government consider the financial structure should enable ratepaJrand taxpayers, local and central government, and Parliament to see a clearunambiguous connection between on the one hand, central government decisl01the size and distribution of Exchequer grant, and on the other hand decisior&apos;3the level of rates.3.23.     With the present system of R3G,  the effect of decisions on the leve-y\ t A3distribution of grant on rate poundages are not explicit,   First, the grar-&apos;&apos;not distributed to each local authority and the present arrangements, theregive a misleading impression of the expenditure decisions of the different levels of local authority.   Second, ratepayers and local authorities cannottell why their Government grant has gone up or down in a particular year,the means for cummunieating the(
expenditure decisions of local authorities - the Kate Demand h&quot;ote - does not setout clearly enough how decisions on grants and rates relate to the separateexpenditure decisions of the various tiers of local government.   To a certain extent the present lack of clarity is inevitable given the basic two tier structure oflocal government, but it can be mitigated.3.26.   Unitary grant would be distributed to each county and district directly;this would remove 3cma of the confusion which arises from the present system.Second,   the standard rate poundage at which an authority could finance itsspending need on a basis comparable with other sirailar authorities would bepublished.   Ratepayers would be in a position to ask, if tho rate poundage wasabove this standard, whether their local authority was le33 efficient or providing services to a higher standard than other similar authorities.   Alternatively, if- the authority fixed a poundage below the standard poundage, it could be that theauthority was mors efficient or providing services to a lower standard than other similar authorities, and so reducing the burden on its ratepayers.  Third,   theRate Demand Note could be designed to convey more clearly how the decisions ongrants and rates relate to the separate expenditure decisions of the varioustiers of local government.3-27*   The present R3G system could be amended so that grant is paid separately to each authority.   It could also be amended to enable ratepayers to see more clearly the effect of expenditure decisions on rate poundages.   With a unitary grant such information is an essential and prominent component of the system.   3ut with thepresent RSG- system, additional information will only confuse an already complicatedsystem making it sven more difficult for the individual -authority and itsratepayers to understand.   It would be less likely to achieve the objective of promoting local accountability.
CONCLUSION3.28.   In summary, the Government see advantages in a unitary grant structure&apos;Unitary grant would offer a- better means of influencing the total expenditureof the local government sector, achieving full equalisation of needs and resand making the financial arrangements more clear to local authorities andratepayers *3*29*-  However, all of the local authority associations fear that the public  jof assessed expenditure need figures for individual authorities would thread11independence of local government.   They argue that the inadequacies of the &amp;seassessment system would lead to      unfair       criticisms of those authoritiesdo not follow the expenditure guidelines.   The Government acknowledge that      1is a genuine concern.   They value local autonomy and believe that some pj-01,and assurances could be developed on this crucial point.of ,3.30.   The history of the development,/systems of Exchequer support for locaauthorities show3 how difficult it is to provide solutions to major problem3which do net themselves create further problems.   The Government believes that changes should only be made after all.possible aspects have been con sir toThey, therefore, propose in the light of the reactions to this Green Paperhave further discussions with the local authority associations to determitewhether the present drawbacks could be overcome by continuing the present- &amp;arrangements with such improvements as the structure allows, or whet *it would be practicable to introduce a unitary grant system.   Also further Jwork is proposed between Government Departments and the local- authority associations on methods of assessing expenditure needs.i

This is essential if local democracy is to be preserved andencouraged:.   However, circumstances arise when the Government wish to safeguardor promote a service or particular activities within a service.   For this purposelocal authorities are either reimbursed or receive preferential Exchequer support in the form of specific or supplementary grants.h-,2*     Specific grants account for approximately 10^ of total grant.   They are paid at varying fixed percentage towards expenditure on a specified service.Supplementary grants amount to almost U-% of total Exchequer grant.h4*3*     The Government consider that specific or. supplementary grants may be appropriate in the following circumstances:(a) to give special encouragement to expenditure on particularactivities or services   where there is a strong nationalinteresti(b) to compensate local authorities for the cost of activitiesengaged in at the request of central government where thoauthority has little or no discration over the amount ofexpenditure incurred;footnote:Specific grants can be open ended or close ended.   Open ended grants (eg thoPolice grant) are payable on all expenditure falling within specified or approved categories.   For close ended grants (eg the Derelict Land Grant) thototal to be disbursed in any one year is fixed in advance.   Supplementary grantse-&apos;3 payable in respect of transport services and national parks.   They are paidnot on expenditure incurred, but on estimates of what the authority will incur onspending plans for the service accepted by tho Government.D&quot;aestricted
(c) to supplement block grant in relation to types of expenditure the need for which arises too unevenly, as betv/een areas oryears, to be reflected in the assessment of expenditure needs;(d) to assist a local authority in the financing of expenditureundertaken for the benefit of a wider area than its own.4*4.     There will be a continuing need for specific or supplementary grants,but the purposes to which they are put will change with time.   Cn the one handnew problems will arise which can be tackled most appropriately by the paymentof such grants.   On the other hand expenditure on certain activities which &amp;recurrently funded by such grants-may in the future be met out of rats support grant when the special needs for specific or supplementary grant have becomeles3 obvious.   The government&apos;s view is that there is a case on grounds of nati0priorities for some modest increase in the proportion of Government aid payaDas specific or supplementary grant particularly in relation-to the education and therefore reducing the proportion paid as block grant.   Such an increase&apos;ld ^6should not, however, go be3rond the point at -which the block grant itself coUcalled into question-4*5*     The Government will want to discuss with the local authority associa^any proposals for an extension of specific grants for local services and als0propose to examine existing specific grants against the criteria set out inparagraph 4*3 above.
CAPITAL expenditure *1*     The Government believe that local authorities should be freer to determinetheir own priorities for capital expenditure within general policy guidelineslaid down by central government.   The project-by-project controls exercisedunder the present system are unnecessariLy detailed.5-2.     The Government need to influence the capital expenditure of localauthorities to ensure that the aggregate of local authority capital expenditureconforms with plans for public spending, that a balance i3 achieved betweenservices, and that a reasonable uniformity of standards is maintained betweenauthorities.   At present the controls exercised by the Government relate almost wholly to borrowing - before they can borrow local authorities must obtainborrowing approvals from Departments.   But borrowing is not synonomous withcapital expenditure.   Borrowing approvals relate to a project, expenditure uponwhich may fall in more than one year, and there may not be close correspondencein any one year between borrowing approval granted and expenditure incurred.In addition, capital expenditure can be financed from other sources, eg revenue,sales of assets, etc,5.3*     The Government, therefore, propose to discuss with the local authority associations a new system of capital expenditure approvals under which individuallocal authorities would be given approval for expenditure on programmes (egeducation, personal social services) rather then on projects.   The approval willrelate to one year and will be accompanied by an indication of the figures likelyto be approved for subsequent years.   Such a system would give local authoritiesgreater freedom to make expenditure decisions in the light of their ownassessment of local needs.lKi:5 I Kl: Mart
VI.      l^C^OFJ^pQALRT^Kj^ (Rates, other taxes, and rents, fees and charges)^.1.     The previous sections have outlined the C-ovemraenfs proposals for strengthening the financial machinery, particularly in relation to grant.   Butlocal authorities also raise substantial sums locally from rates; and from rents,fees and charges for services.   This section examines these and other possiblesources of local revenue.i6.2.     One of the major pressures which led to the establishment of the Committeewas the record increases in r.^te poundages announced by many local authorities in1974/75.   Inevitably, many people hoped that the main outcome of the Committee*work would be to find an acceptable alternative to rates.   But the Committeeafter all its deliberations did not find such an alternative and they recommendedthat the rating system should continue with some modifications.   The Governmentreluctantly accept this conclusion.   They recognise, of course, that rates arean unpopular tax, but the fact remains that if. they were abolished, the revenue would have to be raised from other sources, which could prove to be equally ormore unpopular, and not have the advantages of ra.te3.Rates6.3.     To abolish rates and add the burden to national taxation would mean the endof local taxation in this country.   A significant source of local income isnecessary to preserve local democracy.   In 1976/77 the total yiold from rates wasabout  4,200 million of which  1,700 million came from domestic property and 2,500 million from commercial and industrial properties.   Thi3 taxation yieldi3 second only to income tax.   If the full burden of rates was added to incometax, in 1976/77 the basic rate of income tax would have had to be increased by9ip in the  .   To replace domestic rates by revenue from income tax, the basicincome tax rate would have to be increased by 4p in the  .   Alternatively, if thefull burden was transferred to Value Added Tax, the standard rate would have hadto be increased to 21i%. %t the burden of domestic rates was transferred to VAT,the standard rate would be I3rs$*   Neither of these options could be regarded as an acceptable or less painful alternative to rates.6.4.     Rates have many advantages as a local tax which were noted by the Committee.The tax structure is a reasonably simple one, and the yield is predictablo: it iseasy to administer locally, the coats of collection are low and evasion isdifficult.   As the tax is on immovable property it can be readily identified with
I       uJ J 22 Aprilparticular local areas; and there is no serious problem about confidentialityof information.   Moreover rates are perceptible.   They provide a very apparen*connection between ratepayers and their local authority so maintaining democrat1interest and concern about the activities of local government.6*5*     On the other hand, many criticisms are made of the rating system.   1* *s  ,alleged that rate3 bear no relationship to ability to pay, that they have incre8dramatically in recant years, that they are unfair because wage earners who  not householders do not contribute to local taxes, that they are a tax on anecessity and that they bear no relationship to the services enjoyed by therate payers.   In addjsystem is operated.ratepayers.   In addition many detailed criticisms have bean mads of the way4 .6.       The Committee examined those criticisms and concluded that many we&apos;&apos;3on misconceptions.   Rates are in fact progressive for lower income earnars,due largely to the assistance given to nearly ona third of households by tfcorate rebate scheme and in supplementary benefit.   Rate payments in relation -0incomes have remained remarkably stable in recent years.   Although earning norihouseholders do not pay rates directly,.all who pay national taxes contribut6indirectely to the large part&quot;of local spending met by Government grant.       *not wholly a tax on a necessity.   The degree to which people spend their iwhousing and accommodation varies widely, and contains sosie element of persOD     Jchoice.   Moreover, to the extent that rate3 represent a tax on a minimum )-eVaccommodation, the rate rebate schema alleviates the hardship which might 0be imposed on the poorest.   Finally, although rates baar no relation to theservices enjoyed by the ratepayer, it is a characteristic of a tax (as opPo:a fee or a charge) that it is not a payment related tc services provided6*7*       The Government have considered carefully the advantages and dis&amp;dvaof the rating system.   They agree with the Committee^ conclusion that theadvantages outweigh the disadvantages and in the absence of any preferablealternative, the system should be retained.   They propose, however, to ma*-number of changes to meet the detailed criticisms made of the system anaimprove and strengthen it; the proposed changes are described in paragraP6.24.
OTHER TAXES6,8.     The Committee carried out a thorough review of other sources of localrevenue as a supplement, but not as an alternative,  to local ratss. &apos; Among thepossibilities reviewed wer6 local income tax; local sali&apos;3 taxes and motor vehiclefuel duties; local taxes on businesses, both in the form of taxes on businessprofits and taxes on payroll or employment; and also the possibility of assignedrevenues from national taxation.6.9.     In considering these possibilities, the Committee arpliod two main tests.The first was that the tax ought to be able to produce a. large enough yield topermit a significant reduction&apos;in the proportion of local authority revenue expenditure met by government grants.   The second was that it should be aperceptible local tax: its level should be set locally and people in the areaconcerned should bear the effective burden and be conscious of doing so.   none of these possibilities, with the exception of local income tax (LIT), passedthese tests.   Local sales tax did not meet the tests of local accountability andperceptibility, and would be complex to administer.   Kotor vehicle fuel duty would not foster accountability.   Local payroll tax would not have the propertiesof accountability or perceptibility, and by varying wages and salaries indifferent locations could conflict with regional policies.   Assigned revenuesalso would not foster accountability or be perceptible and would have noadvantages over the present grant system.   The Committee concluded that none ofthese possibilities were feasible.   The Government has itself considered themcarefully and agrees with the Committees view.it.10. The Committee established that if ths national system of personal taxationwere first considerably shnplied, it would be feasible to bring a form of LITinto operation in five years time,   But they noted that the scale of resourcesinvolved in having LIT would be considerable.   In evidence to the Committee, the inland Revenue put the staff numbers at 12,000, involving expenditure of theorder of , 50 million a year in Great Britain as a whole, with the expectation thata roughly comparable cost in staff and finance would fall or. private employers.The Committee concluded that the introduction of LIT would not be warranted in asystem based on central responsibility.   But they saw it as a prerequisite of alooalist solution, since they considered it would confer substantial advantages in tex-ms of greater accountability.\jj X i*m O a sfA a \* I L. tJ? J
29 A?^16.11.   The objections to a localist solution have been outlined in section 2 *- put in any event tho Government do not accept that local accountability depsn^3 *ji -i flo*the proportion of revenue raised locally; or that any clear advantages vrouJ-u *from the introduction of LIT.   The freedom of local authorities to vary the uxrate would havo to be closely constrained so that it did not unduly complica^0central government economic and financial management; and there would need &amp;0some equalisation of the procaeds of the tax between richer and poorer areas.i Wit/Partly for these reasons, it seems highly questionable whether the great maJ0&apos;of electees could be made go aware of tho LIT element in their normal PAYS        Jdeduction:; as to achieve the Committee^ objective of securing an effective loCdiscipline on local..authority expenditure decisions^6.12. The Government do not believe therefore that local income tax should beintroduced.I?.?ROyii;G TH7? SLATOG- SYSTEMGiven that the rating system is to be retained, it is important that p-number of the weaknesses identified by the Committee should be rectified.   ^Government, therefore propose to introduce legislation and administrative onin the near future to improve and strengthen the system.Valuation of domestic property6.i-&apos;j..   The Coramitteo concluded that for domestic properties future ravalust1- t^eehe based on capital values rather than the present rental values.   The Cciobexamined ether possibilities for the calculation of rateable values inexua-u      ,use of site values.   Site value rating would involve taxing the owners 01in relation to the market rental that it would attract were it available iQmost profitable permissible development. The Committee considered and theGovernment agree, that such a system would present major difficulties both.9principle and practice. . Tho Government- also agree that at the next ratingrevaluation domestic property shall be assessed on the basis of capital va
-. or69 15* Whatever the method used for assessment, property values need to beregularly reassessed to ensure that the rateable values adequately reflectrelative movements in the values of the properties.   However, the point has nowbeen reached where there is no longer enough evidence of free market rental valuesto support another revaluation of domestic property on the present basis.   in contrast, the evidence for valuing non-domestic properties on a capital basis isnot so plentiful as for a rental basis, and such evidence as there is would bemuch more difficult to translate into a rateable value.   The Government, therefore,propose to introduce legislation for a change to capital valuations for domesticproperty only.6.16.  As the Committee pointed out, the change to capital values will lead to some changes in the distribution of the rate burden between individuals.   But this would happen to a greater or lesser extent at any revaluation.   For example, the 1973revaluation, which was the first for ten years, produced some big changes in distribution because of relative movements in rental values.6.17.   Preliminary work suggests that a capital valuation would lead to averagereductions in rateable values relative to the national average in seme regionsand relative increases in others.   Nationally, there will probably be a tendency forrateable values of properties at the top and bottom ends of the market to riserelative to the national average and of some properties in the middle to fall.0.13.   it should however be stressed that these are only preliminary indications of possible effects.   The earliest date by which the next revaluation could takePlace on the new basis would be 1 SB2/33*   Trie Government intend that thistimetable should be achieved.   By that time the relationship between the capital^value of different domestic properties and their current rateable value could have changed significantly.   The Government will therefore be keeping the position underreview before the revaluation on the new basis comes into force.   The effect ofeny increased rate burden on low income groups ?/ould be largely mitigated by raterebates, but the effect on all income groups would need to be considered carefullyin the light of the general fiscal burdens prevailing at the next revaluation.a N1       ^a&quot;&quot; *^ s     ra&apos;&apos;*K &apos;jMa      \
% Baa W    a    I \ I %uj?    i    tea6.19,   In any event the Government intend to provide for the phasing in of any changes in rote bills resulting from the capital value basis revaluation over aperiod of years from the next revaluation.   In more extreme oases, should they &amp;Apermanent arrangements may be mada to mitigate the effects of the change in the jbasis of revaluation.-  The precise form of these arrangements will have to bedecided, after consultation with local authority associations, nearer the date ofthe revaluation when the pattern of valuation changes is better known.6.20.   Because capital value is very different from annual rental value (which fcontinue to be the basis of assessment for all non-domestic hereditaments) it ifrbe necessary to apply a divisor to the capital value of dwellings so as to prova common charge base for all properties.   It would then be possible to apply ageneral rate poundage to domestic and non-domestic properties.   The divisor willdetermine the relative rate burden between domestic and non-domestic ratepayerswhich would be fair to both sides.   At present this relative burden is datermin8by the level of domestic rate relief.   The Committee thought this relative burc;should not be subject to annual review, because it led to undesirable inst&amp;bili&apos;but rather fixed nationally at revaluations.   The Government accept this view.6.21*   The Committee also recommend that revaluations should be carried out atleast at 5-yearly intervals.   The Government accept this recommendation whichis in line with the.present statutory requirement.6.22. Capital valuation of domestic properties will narrow the variations in $rateable values of similar properties in different parts of the courtry. It s&amp;therefore go 3o;ne way to reduce the differences in the size of rate bills, altb:it is not possible to say how far until substantial progress has been made on 0actual valuation work.&apos; Sera ting of agricultural, land, and buildings6.23.   The Government accept that in terms of rating principle there are extras&apos;good grounds for treating agriculture just like other industries.   But there et*strong practical arguments against the Commit tee*s recommendation for there-rating of agricultural land and buildings.   First, the total income of localauthorities would probably ba unchanged because the increase in rateable value would be balanced by a reduction in the scale of support grant from centralGovernment.    Second, re-rp.ting would involve extra costs in the revaluation ofWWMBWI-1 Mint (MM Ijl IMIN II mm Mill Ty ffllM II MM&apos;
agricultural properties for the Inland Revenue and for local authorities.   Finally,there would he significant adverse affects on the financial position of the farming industry with consequential effects on home feed production and food prices.   TheGovernment therefore do    not propose to accept the Committee*s recommendation.Other rat3.ni? propogalg6.24.   The Government propose to make a number of more minor changes in the rating system, based on recommendations made by the Committee.   The Government*s proposals are set out in Appendix III. They include changes which will help small businessesin particular, by an extension of the right to opt to pay rates by instalmentsto non-domestic ratepayers and by changes in the way domestic rate relief is givento ratepayers who occupy mixed commercial and domestic properties.   Other changes will improve and strengthen the administration and operation of the rating system in relation to the rating of Crown properties and public utilities arid in theappeals machinery.   And the Government propose that local authorities shall be compensated for ths rate relief they are required by Parliament to give tocharities.jgNTS. FEES AND CHARGES6.25.   Local authorities finance about 13/? of their total revenue expenditure fromfees and charges.   They raised over  2,000m a year by this means in 1975/76.Housing rents account for about half the total, but the remainder comes from a widsVariety of services - from cemetries to school meals, municipal airports to refusecollection from business premises.   There is a wide range of statutory provisions   -governing the power of local authorities to levy charges rather than meet thewhole cost from ratos.   The amount which can be charged varies from case to case;some charges are prescribed by regulation and others are at the discretion of theindividual authority.   The Committee considered that there was little consistencyin policy or in practice, either yd thin central government - as to the extent to7&apos;&apos;hich different types of charges are regulated, or-amongst local authorities -as to the decisions on charging within their discretion.   They thought it possiblefor charges to play a bigger part in the financing of local services than atPresent and they therefore recommended that there should be a joint review of central and local government&apos;s policies towards charging for local services.t      i-on
6.26. The Government accepts the Committee&apos;s proposal and intend to discuss **the local authority associations the scope, composition and terms of reieren^ -the review. The aims would-be to determine for which services charges shoiueprescribed centrally and which left to local discretion; to remove anomaliias Mand between services and between local authority and other public services,&apos; -,0review the statutory level of charges; to recommend which services should noWbe expected to cover their full cost, and to recommend appropriate criteriasetting charges.   Since housing rents, transport fares and school meal charges are already under review in other contexts, these subject will be excluded xr0iathe scope of the review.   Kon housing rents will, however, be included.   TheGovernment also propose to exclude the question of public library charges.   *review will cover activities yielding nearly  800m revenue each year.
(J &quot;igw psai \ E w i L.vu .     valub FOR MOUSY7*1*     It is in everyone&apos;s interest that local services should be provided asefficiently and economically as possible.   Waste, extravagance and inefficiencymust lead to higher taxes and a lower standard of service.   The Committeereceived considerable complaint about this, and their report laid stress onthe need to ensure value for money and contained a number of recc:nmendatior.s.7.2.     The Committee did not attea.pt a detailed, analysis of the complaints they received and so made no assessment of whether authorities are more cr less efficient than other large organisations.   They pointed out that the complaintshave to be seen in perspective and that inefficiency may be found in any organisation.   Nevertheless the evidence the Committee received indicates thata good deal of public disquiet exists.7.2&apos;     The Government cannot ignore this disquiet.   They fully understand thatvalue for money in the provision of local services is something which must comaprimarily from within local government itself.   Local!, authorities areindependent bodies democratically accountable to their local electorate.It is for them to order their affairs as they see fit.&quot;   The first line ofdefer.ee against waste extravagance and inefficiency must be the elected member.It is important that he should be accountable and responsible.7.4.     The Government have a major interest, however, -in ordering the system tohelp the elected member do his job properly and the electorate to judge whether he is doing it properly.   For this more information is needed about the performance of local authorities.   The Government agree with the Committee that more comparative and other value for money studies into the efficient   use of resources should bo undertaken and published. They think there is more scope -fora much wider range of information to be made available through publicity and.studies about the comparative practices of local authorities&quot;.   Undoubtedly these studies pose difficulties of interpretation and analysis and there is apossibility of unfair   publicity for some local authorities.   Co Rents aboutefficiency may easily become entangled with criticisms about policy and attempts to restrict legitimate policy decisions by local authority members.   But theseare difficulties to be guarded against, not reasons for failing to provide more information for local authorities and the public.
7*5.     Provided these studies are done carefully and effectively and are seen to be done so it is of lesser importance who undertakes them.   A large numberefficiency studies are already carried out by individual authorities and bythe central local authority advisory agencies (eg LAMSAC).   These studies sboU*continue ixid the Government will seek to ensure greater co-ordination and increased scope for these studies.   However the Audit Service should also ha&apos;&apos;6a useful role to play.   They already do value for money studies under theirexisting code of practica; the Government propose that they should be able toextend this work into comparative studies where necessary and appropriate,7*6.     The work that district auditors and approved auditors do helping localauthorities to maintain proper financial disciplines is invaluable.   It su^however, in informing the electorate generally from lack of publicity.   *UI&quot;there is no forum where general matters arising from audit reports can bediscussed.   The Government propose that the Head of the Audit Service shoulproduce an annual report dealing with such general audit matters as  systems of local authority accountancy, particular financial control problems rai*e*statutory previsions, the health and soundness of local authority finances^and that this should be published.   The Government also proposs that an&quot;independent institution&quot; - to use the Committes&apos;3 word3 - should be s ew u*comment on and consider such a report and also look at general audit matter3&apos;including advising upon the need for comparative studies.7.7.     The &quot;independent institution&quot; would be a basically advisory body aP?by the Secretaries of State for the Environment and for Wales whose reports&quot;0available for all those concerned with local authority financial mattersJcAmajority cf its members would be appointed from amongst nominees put fcrwa1the local authority associations, although others would be appointed fromamongst eg those with special knowledge of wider financial matters.   The bo&amp;would not comment on the reports of auditors in individual authorities, whic*cculd continue to be made, as now, to the Council themselves nor would 1*any formal role in the statutory jurisdiction of the Secretary of State inrelation to audit.7.6.     The Government consider there are advantages in retaining the ass0 -*of the District Audit -?&apos;ith the Department of the Environment and do not pto change this relationship.   District Auditors will of course remain en-independent of the Department in the exercise of their statutory duties ***carrying out audits of individual authorities.
RES i RSC a l29 -april the Committee suggested that it was wrong in principle for any publicooiy to be in a position to choose its own auditor, and that therefore the rightof authorities to appoint&apos; their own auditors should be abolished.   TheGovernment do not believe however that this freedom leads to any undesirableresults.   Local authorities pre responsible, under the law, for their own affairs, and they are boat placed to judge whether the expertise of the districtauditor or of a private auditor is best suited to their needs.  ,Moreover, thelocal authorities freedom of choice is net absolute.   The &quot;approval of theSecretary of State for the Environment is required before an authority canemploy private auditors.7*10.   The Committee recommended that the Chief Financial Officer of an authority should be placed under a new statutory duty to reoort directly andregularly to the council on, defined financial issues.   The Government believethat this is unnecessary since in most local authorities the Chief financialOfficer would be expected to draw the council&apos;s attention to matters on whichthe financial, consequences had not in his view been adequately presented.Such a move would a.so conflict with the trend towards corporate management andthe freedom of councils to define their own management structures and procedures.

CONSULTATIONS BKTWggN CJNTBAL AND LOCAL. ,G0VgglJMEIjT8.1,   The Government have been impressed by the way in which local authorities have sought to bring their budgets into line v/ith Government&apos;s public expenditureuolicies.   They consider one of the reasons for this to be the increased generaleffectiveness of the co-operative arrangements between central and local government.This co-operation must be maintained and enhanced.    A partnership can only be effective whan both partners are able to consult each&apos;other on issues of common concern.   Consultations have been greatly improved since the Government established the Consultative Council on Local Government Finance in 1975*   Meetings of theCouncil are attended by representatives of local authority associations aad the glc and by Ministers from Departments v/ith a major interest in local government services.   The Welsh Consultative Council provides a separate forum for thediscussion of matters of particular interest to Wales.8.2.   In their report the Committee noted that the Consultative Council had boonestablished but that it was too early for them to form a judgement about its v/ork.The Committee, however, recommended the establishment of a new joint forum toimprove communication between central and local government and provide detailed analysis of the impact of central policies on local government finance.   They also recommended that the operation of the Consultative Council should be reviewed inthe light of their proposals.8*3*     Control and local government discuss major financial issues in the consultative Council and its subsidiary committees.   The annual rate support grant negotiations take place under the Council*3 auspices; local government is nowassociated through the Council with the Governments annual Public &quot;expenditure survey; and the Council is consulted at an early stage in the development of policies with implications for local government expenditure.8.4*     The Government believe that the Council has already done much to improvecommunications and understanding between central and local government.   It would be right, therefore,  to build on what has been achieved and develop the work of theCouncil in response to events.   The potential of the Consultative Council for furtherUseful development was stressed by the local authority associations in commenting on&quot;the Committee&apos;3 recommendation.   The Government, therefore, propose to examine withthe local authority associations ways in which the Consultative Council and it3subsidiary committees could, most usefully be developed to facilitate co-operationbetween central and local government.   There have been improvemmt3 in the statistics^formation on local authority finance and the Government intend to continue to seekfurther improvements with the local authority associations and other organisations,

RESTRICTED29 AprilAPPENDIX IA UNITARY GRANT1*   The present i*ate support grant aims to enable individual local authorities tomeet the assessed spending needs by levying the same rate poundage.   To achieve this it uses two separate grants, the needs element to equalise spending needs per head and the resources element to equalise resources per head.    If all authorities&apos;needs and resources per head are the same then they can levy the same rate poundageto meet their assessed spending needs.   The needs element also pays out some grantper head of population which has the effect of reducing the rate poundage at whichell authorities can meet their spending needs. ,2.   But the use of a two-part needs and resources grant has a number ofdisadvantages.   First it obscures the equalising aim of the distribution:   inparticular, the role of needs element is misunderstood.   Many mistakenly regard theneeds grant as a payment in proportion to neeas.   Secondly, because there are verygreat variations in the needs and resources of local authorities, a prohibitivelyhigh grant total would be needed to put all authorities in the same position asboth the authority with the lowest   needs and the authority with the highestresources per head.    To achieve full equalisation in practice it would be necessaryeither to make offsetting adjustments to the needs element allocations of theauthorities with the highest resotnrces. or to allow a levy on areas with highresources within the resources eleme&apos;nt allocation.   The first method has beenoperated for London:    it has proved complicated to operate and unpopular:   thealternative would be even more so.3.   A unitary grant system based on the principle ox equalising needs and resourcesby a single grant payment would overcome these problems.   The grant allocation to each authority would be the payment which would enable each authority to provideoverall Itvels of service comparable with other authorities, if it levied a standard rate poundage.   The basic grant would bo the difference between thecost to an authority of providing a standard level of service and the revenue itwould raise from a standard rate poundage.   This means that two sets of figures are crucial; the assessment of the cost to each authority of providing comparableoverall level of services and the corresponding national standard poundage^Suppose two authorities A and B spend  150 and  120 per head respectivelyt andthe authority with &quot;the minimum spending need spends  1-00 per head.    Under thepresent system, a needs element designed to equalise needs would pay out  J50per head to authority A and  20 per head to B.    Any grant remaining would bepaid out equally per head, say, another  10 per head to each, making  oC per head to A and  30 to B in total.    In contrast a. proportionate grant meetingeg kCf  of expenditure, would pay  60 per head to A and  48 per head to B,
. 25 APriltic; S .&apos;uU ik.   The relative expenditure need assessment for an authority would represent  ^estimated cost of providing a standard, overall level of service 1   These figures would provide each area v/ith a spending guideline.    It would however be open to authorities to spend more or less in total than this guideline.    If twoauthorities both chose to spend, say, .5$ more than their- spending need asses^8they would still be regarded as providing their areas with comparable overalllevels of service, albeit at a J?o higher level than that embodied in theirspending need figure.5*     The Government would set standard poundages for authoriti.es spending- -guideline leval, and different standard poundages for authorities spending Jimore than the guideline, 5% loss, or for any other percentage variation fromguideline level.   These poundages would determine the individual ratepayer 8contribution towards their authority&apos;s spending: the G-overnment would financetho balance by grant.consi^6.   In deciding the standard poundages, the Government would have thretions in mind.   First, it would want to achieve the right national balance the burden of local government spending on ratepayers on  he one hand arid on national taxpayers on the other.   This would decide the standard poundage *meeting levels of spsnding exactly corresponding with the guideline spendingbet**7.     Secondly, they would recognise that seme authorities will decide to spmore than their guideline levels.   The Government would net wish to restrainunnecessarily the discretion of individual authorities to determine their 0^spending levels.   But thsy would have to give authorities sufficient incen*  ^weigh their higher expenditure plan3 against the need to keep total local au,flspending within the nationally-planned total.   So authorities spending moitheir guideline amounts would have to charge their ratepayers a progress^-higher poundage.   In that way, an authority choosing to spend more mightsome extra grant but it3 spending would be financed increasingly by itsratepayers and less by the G-overnment.   An authority spending less than ibguideline amount would be treated comparably.   For example, all authcritiespending 2% less than their expenditure guidelines would be able to reouopoundages by an equal amount.   The ratepayers would finance the seme poi&apos;*they would 4dfllipethe authority&apos;s expenditure   aa/if it spent in accordance with its guioamount, and indeed might finance a smaller portion.8.   Thirdly, the Government recognise the Impossibility of absolute preci5      .Id the&apos;the assessment of the relative spending needs cf authorities.   They woui-
restricted&apos;        2ia&quot;ilseek to graduate the effect on ratepayers of spending by authorities whichdiffered from the authority&apos;s guideline amount.    So, for example, if a 10$variation in spending was to alter rate poundages by 20p, a      variation wouldalter them proportionately by 2p, but by some smaller amount.9*   For a few authorities the spending needs guidelines could be significantlybelow existing expenditure levels.   This would mean that under a unitary grantsystem a significant increase in rates would be required to finance existingexpenditure.   To mitigate the effects of this change in the grant system, theguideline figures need not bo determined exclusively by the expenditure needassessment.   They could be partly determined by existing expenditure figures.This would constitute a much more understandable method of &quot;damping1 than that used in the present grant distribution system.R ;:i o i    i       &apos; - ^3F.
APPE l IDIX   1! ITHE ASSESSMENT OF SPENDING need the proposals in this   Green   Paper place a considerable emphasistho role of needs assessment in the local government finance system.It will therefore be important to ensure that -the most practicable0r:&apos;I acceptable methods of assessment are used.    The chosen method mustAccount for variations between authorities in:(a) the number end type of people who require particular serviceseg areas with relatively more handicapped old people may-need to spend relatively more on personal social services;(b) the amount of economic resources required to provide a comparable standard of services, eg sparsely populated areasmay have to have smaller classes end a more favourablepupil :  teacher ratioj(e)    the relative prices of the resources required, eg specialLondon salary weightings in London lead to higher labour costs per employee in London than elsewhere.2OfintoTho present method of assessing needs for the distribution ofatlt seeks to identify a general relationship between the patternExisting expenditure and general characteristics of local authori-es -- need factors - -which represent the sort of variations listedParagraph 1.

Tho complications are. mainly the result of the prosedgrant structure and the changes have partly been caused by change3the grant total and in the data for the need factors.    These probleinlarise&apos; whatever needs assessment is used.    The present method shouldbe able to identify tho extent to which some authorities spend moito provide    particularly higher standards of service, and otnersbheir expenditure down by maintaining lower standards of service.These influences can be excluded from the formula used to assessBut in practice, it has proved difficult to identify particularfactors representing differences in service levels.[j..      The Committee proposed research into alternative methods oiassessment and particularly methods -relying less on the existingpattern of expenditure.    The Government and the local authorityciations are investigating alternative methods and comparing.assonresults with the existing method.    So far work has concentratedmethod which identifies the main client groups for local government services  (eg school children, old people) and the national averageexpenditure per person within each group.    pother need factors &amp;then identified by analysing the difference - between these national average expenditures and the expenditure each authority has actualincurred.    It is not yet clear whether this approach can be ******into a morejffective and acceptable system than the present on?.      In the longer term it may be possible to develop an alternsystem based on detailed analyses of the composition of expend!toon each of the large number of individual operations which gQ-id beup each main service local authorities provide.

These figures would then bo applied to selected standards of provision for each operation to determine the total cost of&apos; all services in each authority.    The major problem is the measurement ofthe outputs for each operation within a service and of deciding bo-What standard each operation should bo provided,b.      The problems of assessing needs by using analytical methodshave led to suggestions that a simpler approach might be more satisfactory*-    It is possible that agreement could be reached    in common-sense terms about the main factors -which determine spendingheeds.    But -without some analytical evidence, it might be impossibleto agree what weights should be attached to each factor.    A simpleapproach would inevitably ,tend to fall bade on the very analyticalMethods which it was trying to avoid.    This simpler approach based ona central assessment of local authority budgets is used in Scotlandout the number and variety of authorities to be dealt with is much less than in England and Wales, and the conditions are very different&apos;.&apos;&apos;      It has to be recognised that there -can never be- a totallyobjective method of needs assessment.    All the possible methodsinvolve judgements at some stage.    In the end the choice betweenMethods must bo a judgement, but the Government recognise that thischoice    should be made only after a thorough review of:the alternatives in consultation with the local authority associations.

In addition to the proposed adoption of capital values for domestic properties,  the Government also propose to introduce byway op legislation or by administrative action a number of more&amp;inor changes in the rating eye ten, based on recommendations made bythe Committee.

Clarification, of Rate Demands10.    The Committee thought that ratepayers should be able to see.which authority is responsible for the &quot;expenditure decisionsreflected in their rate-bills.    The Government agree that this isessential if local accountability is  to be promoted.    At presenteach tier does not receive its own share of grant.    If a unitarygrant system is adopted,  and grant is paid separately&apos; to each tiein relation to its need,   then it will be possible to amend theprecept and rate resolution procedures and the rate demand notenuke it clear which level of local government is responsible foVwhat expenditure, how much is met by grant,  and how much remains to be met by ratepayers.

TheCommittee considered whether some means of reducing the volumeof appeals could be found without restricting the individual&apos;s1egitimate rights,  and. thought some restriction would be justified.The Government broadly accept the Committee1s conclusion and propose to legislate to amend the current system so that the period for appealing against assessments Is restricted to the first year of a new list exceot where some material&quot;, change has occurred** m.1 --- qdo Li.csaffecting the value (a similar procedure/in Scotland).
