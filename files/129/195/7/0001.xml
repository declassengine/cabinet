COMMUNITY AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT PRICES 1977-78Memorandum by the Minister of AgricultureFisheries and FoodINTRODUCTION1. The Cabinet discussed in June and November last year our attitude to this year&quot;s negotiation of CAP support prices (CM(76) 9th and 34thConclusions).    We decided then to take as tough a line as was compatible with the avoidance of confrontation, and to make only such concessions onthe Green Pound as were fully justified by an acceptable price settlement.We now have to decide in more detail our attitude on both substance and timing.2. The Commission&apos;s proposals comprise an average increase in common prices of only 3 per cent;  green currency changes, including a5. 9 per cent devaluation of the green  ;  and a revised action programme to deal with the milk surplus.    These proposals would add about 2 per cent to the food price index (0. 5 per cent on the cost of living), in addition to afurther 2 per cent resulting from the last two transitional steps required bythe Treaty of Accession.3. The Commission^ proposals were discussed by the Council ofMinisters (Agriculture) last week, when all the pressures frcm other member   countries were for larger common price increases.    The Councilmeets again on 25-27 March to try to reach a settlement.    I have discussedour attitude with my colleagues in the Ministerial Committee on EuropeanQuestions.    Broadly, we are agreed on the sticking points on common price increases (3 per cent on milk and beef, 3. 1 per cent average on cereals).But there remain issues of substance and timing which my Cabinet colleaguewill wish to consider.THE GREEN POUND4. The central issue of substance is whether or not to agree to anydevaluation of the green pound.    Refusal to agree to any devaluation willmake it much more difficult to reach a settlement:  other member countries and the Commission are pressing hard for an indication that we are notinflexibly attached to the present rate.    If we succeeded, and if commonprices were agreed close to the Commissions proposals, we should still be faced with an increase of about 0. 75 per cent on retail food prices(0. 2 per cent on the cost of living) by the end of the year, in addition to the transitional steps.1DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 32COPY NO  0 021 March 1977CABINET
5. The alternative is to concede a small green pound devaluation, on condition that its effect on food prices is more than offset by a Community-financed butter subsidy.    If the rate of subsidy were pitched at a level whichjust offset the effect of the green pound devaluation on all foods, it wouldrequire a subsidy averaging about 8p per lb to offset the effect of a2 per cent green pound devaluation (the figures are discussed in more detail in a paper by officials).    This has considerable attractions.    The subsidy would wipe out the big butter price increase that will otherwise take placein April/May.    Other resulting price effects are much less significant and less sensitive.    A small green pound devaluation could in these circumstances be defended as being amply compensated for by the subsidy, a tough settle-ment on CAP prices and a convincing action programme on the milk surplus.I regard this as the better option.TIMING6.        At last week&apos;s meeting, and despite the complication of the Belgiangeneral election on 17 April, there  was considerable pressure from other member countries to make a serious attempt at a settlement on 25-27 March,We have to decide whether we are prepared to see a settlement then, orwhether, if a package deal appeared to be emerging, we should deliberatelyblock it.    Some of my colleagues see advantage in blocking a settlement,even if satisfactory terms seem to be available.    If all other member countries are prepared to settle this week-end on terms that areadvantageous to us, I believe, however, that we should settle.7. I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that I should be authorised tosettle this week-end on terms within the limits we have agreed.    It is verydifficult to forecast precisely the shape of a final package:  if it went in any respect beyond the agreed limits but seemed on balance to be acceptable, Iwould wish to have authority to settle, subject to prior consultation fromBrussels with the Prime Minister.conclusion. I invite my colleagues to agree that:-i.     we should be prepared to agree to a minor devaluationof the green pound provided that its effect on United Kingdomfood prices were more than offset by a Community-financedbutter subsidy:  and that CAP prices for 1977-78 were determined within acceptable limits;ii.    if it proves possible to settle on acceptable terms on25-27 March I should be authorised to do so, subject toprior consultation as necessary with the Prime Minister.J S ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food21 March 1977
