DoCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(77) 30 COPY NOu CJ4 March 1977CABINETWHITE PAPER ON CASH LIMITS FOR 1977-78Note by the Chief Secretary, Treasuryl* Last year we published cash limits for the forthcoming financial year*a a White Paper at the same time as the Budget.    We shall be expected todo the same this year.    But, whereas last year it was necessary to use theWhite Paper to introduce the new policy of a widespread application of cashUmits, the system is now established.    The limits for 1977-78 have been derived in the same manner as those for 1976-77 and significant changes inthe way they will be operated are not proposed.    The text for the white paper setting out cash limits for 1977-78 can therefore be simple and^controversial.2-        The text has already been cleared interdepartmentally at official level and the central Government and local authority cash limits which are set out in the tables have been agreed individually with the Departmentsconcerned.    The cash limits are derived from the planned expendituretQtals for 1977-78 set out in volumes I and II of the White Paper, &quot;TheGovernment*s Expenditure Plans&quot; (Cmnd 6721).3-        A book proof is attached.    If my colleagues have any comments^ese should be given to me by the afternoon of Thursday 17 March at thelatest.    Unless any members of the Cabinet see objection it is proposed toPolish the White Paper on Cash Limits for 1977-78 on Tuesday 2J treasury Chambers14 toarch 1977RESTRICTED

CASH LIMITS 1977-781. Last year the Government published a White Paper* on cash limitsapplying to an extensive range of public sector expenditure. These have madea useful contribution to improving financial control, and the government intend to apply cash limits on similar lines to expenditure in the financialyear 1977-78. The limits have been derived from the planned volume ofexpenditure shown in the White Paper, The Government^ Expenditure Plans&apos;(Cmnd 6721).2. The 1977-78 cash limits for central government expenditure and for capitalexpenditure by local authorities and certain other bodies are set out in Tables 1and 2, respectively. Local authority current expenditure is not subject to direct control by central government but cash limits are placed on the amount offinancial assistance provided to local authorities by the central government through the rate support grant and supplementary grants; these cash limitsare included in Table 1. Nationalised industries&apos; estimated financing require-ments, which are published in Table 13 of the Financial Statement and BudgetReport, will again be treated as a form of cash limit.3. New housing investment, slum clearance and expenditure under theCommunity Land Act are included for the first time in the cash limits for capital expenditure by local authorities, etc., given in Table 2. Cash limits onthe borrowing requirements of the Regional Water Authorities and the WelshNational Water Development Authority are also included in Table 2. Certainexpenses of the Bank of England connected with financial management areincluded in cash limits for the first time (in Table 1). As described in thestatement on shipbuilding policy made on 24 February 1977, the cash limit on assistance to shipbuilding has been discontinued and replaced by a new form of control ceiling. With the exception of these changes and some other less important amendments, the coverage of cash limits in 1977-78 remainsessentially the same as in 1976-77. A limited number of changes have alsobeen made, in the light of experience and to reflect departmental reorganisation,to the way in which expenditure is grouped into blocks for cash controlpurposes. Appendix 1 describes the elements of voted and non-voted expenditure which are included in the central government blocks.4. Provisional figures for the outturn of central government expendituresubject to cash limits in 1976-77 will be published as soon as possible afterDepartments have closed their books for that year. It is likely that informa-tion on local authority capital expenditure cash blocks will not be available as early as for central government, but figures for these blocks will be published as soon as they are available.* &apos;Cash Limits on Public Expenditure&apos; (Cmnd 6440), April 1976.
