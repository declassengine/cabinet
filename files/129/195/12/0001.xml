PREFACEThe Case for ChangeThere have been many changes in British society and in this country&apos;s role in the world since the British Nationality Act which provides the basis of ourcitizenship was passed in 1948. The law has been amended on numerousoccasions so that it is in some respects complicated and obscure. Moreover,because Britain is no longer an Imperial power the all-embracing concept of nationality associated with this role, including the citizenship of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies, is no longer appropriate. It follows there is need nowto examine how our nationality law can be simplified and brought up-to-date.Shortly after taking office the Government, in accordance with the LabourParty Manifesto of February 1974, set up a group to examine what should bedone. This discussion document is based largely on their work.The Government do not intend to introduce early legislation on the subject.They recognise that there is room for differing views both on the principles anddetails of a new scheme, and they think it right to give ample time for study and discussion of the ideas in the document, which would affect everyone in thiscountry and many people overseas. The Government have themselves reachedno firm conclusions on many of these ideas. But where they are at presentinclined towards a particular course the document says so.The law of nationality evolved slowly and it is only comparatively recentlythat it has had a statutory basis. The Government are anxious to ensure that any revision of the law should provide a system which is both satisfactory and lasting;and that in removing difficulties and grievances which changes in the nature ofthe Commonwealth since 1948 have placed on the system then introduced, itshould not create fresh difficulties. This is a complex task requiring time for full consideration of all the issues involved.The main ideas canvassed in the document are summarised below. They are designed to put right the main defect in our present law. This is that our presentcitizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies, as its name implies, relatesboth to the United Kingdom and overseas territories; it does not identify thosewho belong to this country and have the right to enter and live here freely; inconsequence it prevents the United Kingdom from basing its immigrationpolicies on citizenship. Our citizenship is in these respects different from thecitizenships of many other countries including our partners in the european community.Possible ChangesTwo new citizenshipsIn paragraphs 13-16 it is suggested that the present citizenship of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies might be replaced by two citizenships a BritishCitizenship for those who have close ties with this country, and a British OverseasCitizenship which would be held by the remainder of those persons who are nowcitizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies.
People who would become British CitizensIt is suggested that British Citizenship should be conferred, in general, on those citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who were born, naturalisedor registered here (or in the Channel Islands or Isle of Man); on those who holdthat citizenship by descent and have the right of entry; and on those citizens ofthe United Kingdom and Colonies and British Protected Persons from depen-tendencies or former dependencies (including those from East Africa) and BritishSubjects without Citizenship, who have settled in this country for a specified period (paragraphs 19-26).It would be the intention that British Citizens and only British Citizens should have an unqualified right of free entry to the United Kingdom; but thereare some people who now have such a right who would not become BritishCitizens under these proposals, and there might be a case for allowing them toretain this right for their lifetimes (paragraphs 27-29).Movement within the European community the present definition of &quot;United Kingdom national&quot; for European Com-munity purposes would need to be redrawn, in consultation with our partners in the Community, so that in general all British Citizens would have the samefreedom of movement within the territory of the Community (paragraph 30).Transmission to children born abroadIt is suggested that women, as well as men, should be able to transmit theircitizenship to their children born abroad, but that transmission should be generally confined to the first generation so born (paragraphs 38-46).Acquisition by virtue of marriageUnder the present nationality law of the United Kingdom, a woman whomarries a man from this country has the right to acquire her husband&apos;s citizen-ship. But a man from overseas who marries a woman from this country has nosuch right. The document discusses whether the law for acquiring citizenshipby virtue of marriage should be altered to treat both sexes equally. It makessome reference to the laws of other countries in this field (paragraphs 48-50).NaturalisationThe question whether there should be any change in the requirements for thegrant of naturalisation, for example as to the standards of character and knowledge of the language, is discussed in paragraphs 51-60.Dual nationalityOur present law imposes no restrictions on the holding of dual nationality.Paragraphs 61-65 mention some of the complexities arising from dual nationality and discuss what charges might be made.British Overseas CitizenshipIt is suggested that British Overseas Citizenship might be conferred on thosecitizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who were born, naturalised orregistered in an existing dependency, or whose fathers were so born, naturalised
or registered. This status would also be conferred on those other people who arenow citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies or British Protected Personsbut who would not become British Citizens. As a general rule entry to a depen-dency would be limited to those who were British Overseas Citizens by virtue ofa connection with it. And British Overseas Citizenship would not carry with itthe right of entry to the United Kingdom (paragraphs 67-70). It would benecessary, so that British Overseas Citizenship should in the longer term be related to dependencies only, to make the rules for acquisition and transmissionmore restrictive than those for British Citizenship (paragraphs 71-74).The special question of United Kingdom Passport holders from East AfricaThese arrangements would not affect the obligation which the Governmenthave assumed towards holders of United Kingdom passports from East Africa,and the special voucher system would continue (paragraph 70).This document is published as part of the process of open Government.Members of the public or representatives of interested bodies who wish toexpress their views on any of the matters discussed in the document are invitedto write to the Home Office, Nationality Division (A.H. Room 1606), Immigra-tion and Nationality Department, 40 Wellesley Road, Croydon CR9 by.
BRITISH NATIONALITY LAWDISCUSSION OF POSSD3LE CHANGESINTRODUCTION1. The Government have been reviewing the working of the British NationalityActs. The chief of these was passed as long ago as 1948, and much has happenedsince then to suggest that a new nationality law is needed. A discussion papercannot cover every problem which arises on this complicated subject; but theGovernment hope that the paper will serve to indicate the major issues fordiscussion and eventual decision.2. The paper does not seek to discuss such matters as the subtle differences between nationality and citizenship but concentrates on practical issues. Atpresent we have a citizenship which does not define those who have a close connection with the United Kingdom; in this respect we are at a disadvantagecompared with most other countries.THE CURRENT NATIONALITY LAWThe British Nationality Act 19483. Our present system of citizenship is unsatisfactory in several ways. Tounderstand it fully, it is necessary to describe how the 1948 Act came to be.Before 1 January 1949 when the 1948 Act came into force, everyone who owedperpetual allegiance to the British Monarch (for example, by birth in the UnitedKingdom, a Dominion or a Colony) was a British subject. There were also largenumbers of people to whom British protection had been granted (british protected Persons). But the need to identify the people of each self-governingDominion by means of a distinct national status more narrowly defined than british nationality was increasingly felt in those countries. Eventually, in 1946,Canada created its own citizenship, although still within the framework ofBritish subject status. After a conference held in London in 1947, the other independent countries of the Commonwealth followed suit, as have othercountries on achieving their independence within the Commonwealth. Underthe new arrangements, each country was to determine who were its citizens, to declare those citizens to be British subjects, and to recognise as British subjectsthe citizens of other Commonwealth countries. However, each country was leftfree to decide what this recognition should entail, so that the content of british subject status has come to vary widely within the Commonwealth.4. The Act of 1948 introduced these principles into United Kingdom law. Itcreated a citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies, with the continuingstatus of British subject, and laid down rules for its acquisition. It was relativelysimple to provide how this status should be acquired in future, but it was moredifficult to decide which of the British subjects then alive should become citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies. The Act gave that citizenship not only toBritish subjects then alive who had ties with the United Kingdom, the channel islands and the Isle of Man, or with a Colony, but also gave it to some Britishsubjects who did not, for one reason or another, acquire the citizenship of anotherCommonwealth country. But most of the Commonwealth countries which were then independent had yet to pass their citizenship laws, and the 1948 Act
therefore provided that British subjects who had ties with those countries shouldbe regarded as potential citizens of them. These people remained British subjectsbut had to wait for a final determination of their status until the countries withwhich they were associated were deemed to have passed citizenship laws (or until they acquired citizenship of another Commonwealth country or of theRepublic of Ireland in some other way, or became aliens). Only if they thenfailed to obtain a citizenship would they become citizens of the United Kingdomand Colonies. In the meantime they were to hold the temporary, non-trans-missible, status of British Subject without Citizenship.5. The Act also provided that all those holding citizenship of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies or of a Commonwealth country should be regarded inUnited Kingdom law as British subjects (or Commonwealth citizens the terms were to be synonymous), and exempted them from the disabilities of aliens.Citizens of Eire were similarly exempted, and those who were alive when theAct came into force and had been British subjects with ties with the UnitedKingdom were enabled to give notice to remain so. The Act made it easy for a citizen of a Commonwealth country who had come to live in the UnitedKingdom to acquire citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies; he hadmerely to show that he had been ordinarily resident here for 12 months. other provisions of the Act enabled British women who married foreigners to keep their citizenship on marriage (before the Act they had ceased to be Britishsubjects automatically), and gave women from other countries who marriedcitizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies the right to acquire their husband&apos;scitizenship, on application. But British women could not in any circumstancestransmit their citizenship to their children born overseas, and the husbands ofBritish women had no right to acquire their wives&apos; citizenship. The Act was followed by an Order which made new arrangements for the status of british protected Persons.6. It is worth emphasising at this point that the 1948 Act dealt with nationality and citizenship but not with the control of immigration to the United Kingdom.At that time British subjects/Commonwealth citizens were entitled to enterand leave the United Kingdom freely; it was not until 1962 that any of thembecame subject to immigration control.Changes since the 1948 Act7. The scheme set up under the Act has met with various difficulties. First,the status of British Subject without Citizenship, which was intended to betransitional, has persisted. This is because India and Pakistan enacted citizenshiplaws in 1950 and 1951 which withheld citizenship from many people who hadderived their status of British subject from their connection with those terri-tories and who were regarded by the British Government at the time of thepassing of the 1948 Act as potential citizens of those countries. The UnitedKingdom did not feel able to grant citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies to all these people from India and Pakistan who had failed to acquiresuch citizenships. They often had no connection with the United Kingdom or a colony then existing. The status of British Subject without Citizenship has there fore remained in existence longer than originally expected, but as people have obtained other citizenships they have ceased to hold it, and since it relates to people born before 1949, the numbers are diminishing.
8. Other problems developed as more countries of the Commonwealthbecame independent. Some of these countries did not, at independence, confertheir citizenship on all the citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies whohad ties with them. Kenya, for instance, did not give its citizenship automaticallyto citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies born in Kenya before indepen-dence, unless one parent had been born there. There were similar problems with British Protected Persons linked with some territories. So significantnumbers of people, for instance in East Africa and Malaysia, did not acquirelocal citizenship on independence and remained citizens of the United Kingdomand Colonies or British Protected Persons even though they had no closeconnections either with the United Kingdom or with one of the remainingColonies. Often they hold no other citizenship.9. Over the years the 1948 Act has been amended about 40 times. Therehave been various reasons for this. A large number of Colonies have become independent and it has been necessary to withdraw citizenship of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies from people who acquired citizenship of the newlyindependent country but had not at the same time a close connection with theUnited Kingdom or a continuing Colony. Other amendments have been neededwhen countries, for example South Africa and Pakistan, have left the Common-wealth, to provide that although their nationals were henceforward foreignersin United Kingdom law they were to continue, for a limited time, to retain their eligibility to acquire our citizenship by registration as if they had continuedto be Commonwealth citizens, rather than by naturalisation. Important amend-ments in the qualifications for acquiring citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies were made in the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962 and the immigration Act 1971. Apart from these amendments there have been others,for example to meet the United Kingdom&apos;s obligations under international agreements. As a result of these numerous amendments British nationality lawhas become difficult to follow.10. The most serious drawback to the status of citizen of the United Kingdomand Colonies is that it does not provide a ready definition of who has the rightof entry to the United Kingdom. In most other western countries, citizens and citizens only automatically have the right of entry. Under our system, a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies may not have any close ties withthe United Kingdom, or even with a remaining Colony. So, when successive governments have found it necessary to control immigration from the Common-wealth, they have felt obliged to distinguish between the citizens of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies whose close ties with the United Kingdom gave them a claim to be freely admitted here, and the remainder. These distinctions within acommon citizenship have been hard to follow. They have caused confusion and have encouraged the belief that our immigration laws contain elements of racial prejudice. The Immigration Act 1971 increased the confusion, since notonly did distinctions within the citizenship of the United Kingdom and Coloniescontinue, but the right of entry was also conferred, to a limited degree, on certain citizens of other Commonwealth countries. As a result, for example,certain Australian and Indian citizens may have a right of entry to the UnitedKingdom which some citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies do not possess.11. As a background to discussion of all the issues, it will be useful to give some idea of the number of people involved. Altogether there are about 950
million people throughout the world who are &quot;British subjects&quot; in our law.Most of these are, of course, citizens of independent Commonwealth countries.Of the rest, 56 million are citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies byreason of their close connection with the United Kingdom itself and are exempt from United Kingdom immigration control. A further 3.3 million (of whom 2.million are in Hong Kong) are citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies by virtue of a close connection with an existing dependency. These do not have aright of entry to the United Kingdom, but they do almost invariably have aright of admission to a dependency. There are, however, a number of citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies about 190,000 mostly in Malaysia,India and Africa who, deriving their status from former dependencies, haveno such rights. (The numbers in East Africa are declining as a result of admissionhere under the special voucher scheme which the Government intend tocontinue). Then there are thought to be some 3 million citizens of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies (1 million in this country) with dual nationality who areexempt from United Kingdom immigration control, and a further 1.3 million(mostly in Malaysia) who are subject to such control. Many of those citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies without rights of entry to either theUnited Kingdom or a dependency are, of course, well established in their countries of residence even when they do not have dual citizenship. Finally, itshould be added that there are believed to be about 250,000 British Subjectswithout Citizenship, and over 274,000 British Protected Persons (the majority in the Solomon Islands). Nearly all of these people are living abroad and are subject to immigration control. About 120,000 Irish citizens have made formalclaims under section 2 of the 1948 Act to remain British subjects (see paragraph5 above).The present situation12. The Act of 1948 reflected the situation of the United Kingdom at thattime. The country was still an Imperial power; it had direct responsibility for very large populations in Colonial territories. The status of British subject,held by all who had links with the Commonwealth, still seemed meaningfuland relevant. The speed at which Colonial territories were to become independentwas not then generally apparent. Women&apos;s status lagged considerably behindthat of men. All these things have changed, and the cumulative effect of the changes has been that the citizenship laws of the United Kingdom no longeraccurately define those who have the normal attributes of citizenship. This in turn leads to considerable uncertainty and misunderstanding, both at home and overseas, about the United Kingdom&apos;s obligations to its citizens.THE NEXT STEP-A NEW SCHEME OF CITIZENSHIP13. A new scheme of citizenship should reflect the strength of the connectionwhich various groups of people have with the United Kingdom in the worldtoday. First, there must be a more meaningful citizenship for those who haveclose links with the United Kingdom (including, for this purpose, the channel islands and the Isle of Man) and who can be expected to identify themselves with British society. Those holding this new citizenship might be known as british Citizens.
14. Such a citizenship would avoid the present difficulties described inparagraph 10 of defining which people are to have the unqualified right of entry to this country. But it might then be necessary to provide protection for therights of entry now enjoyed by people who did not qualify for the new citizen-ship, and this is discussed in paragraph 29.15. Second, arrangements must be made for those people who are nowcitizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies (or British Protected Persons),but who do not have such close ties with the United Kingdom as to becomeBritish Citizens. These people too would have to be given a new status. To leavethose of them who are citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies with thatstatus when many of them have little or no connection by birth, ancestry orresidence with the United Kingdom or any Colony would prolong a misleadingand unsatisfactory feature of the present situation. Instead, both they and theBritish Protected Persons might be known as British Overseas Citizens, thusbringing their status more closely into accord with present-day circumstances.The aim might be to limit this citizenship eventually to those who have the rightof entry to a dependency. British Overseas Citizenship would then carry with it the right of entry to a dependency just as British Citizenship would carry with it the right of entry to the United Kingdom. But this, it must be stressed,would be a long-term aim.16. With the conferment of British Citizenship on some citizens of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies, and British Overseas Citizenship on the remainder,citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies would disappear.17. British Citizens and British Overseas Citizens would be eligible to holdpassports describing them as such and the British Government would beentitled to afford the same consular protection to holders of both citizenships.18. Some possible arrangements for a British Citizenship and a british overseas Citizenship are discussed in detail below. For both citizenships, these would fall into two parts: (i) arrangements for deciding which citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies (and other persons eligible to hold British passports) alivewhen a new scheme came into force were to become either BritishCitizens or British Overseas Citizens that is, the transitional arrange-ments: and(ii) the arrangements for acquiring the citizenship by birth, naturalisationetc., after the scheme was introduced that is, the permanent arrange-ments.A BRITISH CITIZENSHIPTransitional arrangements(a) Groups of citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who might becomeBritish Citizens19. As indicated above, British Citizenship would be for those citizens of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies with close ties with the United Kingdom.Clearly, therefore, the citizenship would be conferred at the outset on thosewho are now citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies because they were
born here, adopted here, or acquired citizenship here by some voluntary act suchas applying for naturalisation or registration.1&quot;20. Then there are those citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who,though not born, naturalised, etc., here themselves, hold their citizenship becauseof the birth or naturalisation of a parent or grandparent here, or who for some-what similar reasons have the right of entry. Where family ties are as close as this, these people too might become British Citizens.21. There are also those who acquired citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies overseas (for example, because they were born in a dependency or a former dependency), have remained citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies, and have made their homes here. The largest element in this group isprobably from East Africa. Many of these people have been admitted to thiscountry specifically for settlement under the special voucher scheme becausethey were under pressure in their country of residence, had not acquired localcitizenship and could not, for instance, work there. In most cases they couldnot have gone elsewhere. Their future lies here. They have established a tiewith this country through their residence here on a permanent basis and thisshould be recognised by conferring British Citizenship on them.22. Mere presence alone on a specified day, however, would probably not be enough to qualify for citizenship. The length and nature of residence wouldhave to be laid down, establishing that the link was a real one. British Citizenshipmight, for instance, be conferred only on those citizens of the United Kingdomand Colonies from overseas who had been resident in the United Kingdom fora specified time and were free of any conditions on their stay at the end of thattime. Any qualification of this kind would, however, have to be simple andeasily proved, since otherwise the person concerned might find it difficult, or his descendants might, to prove that he had become a British Citizen under the transitional arrangements. For those citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies who could not fully meet the requirements on the specified day, itmight be right to make some special arrangement by which they could lateracquire British Citizenship.23. A further group might also be made citizens. These are women citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who would not qualify for BritishCitizenship in their own right, but whose husbands would become BritishCitizens. This would cover, for instance, a woman who is a citizen of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies by virtue of her birth in Hong Kong, who is married to aman who is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies by virtue of his birthin the United Kingdom. The numbers would not be large,(b) Other groups of persons eligible to hold British passports who might becomeBritish Citizens24. Two other groups of British passport holders might also qualify for BritishCitizenship if they have ties with the United Kingdom through their residencehere. These are British Protected Persons and British Subjects without Citizen-ship. The residential ties would be defined for them in the same way as for the citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies from overseas (see paragraph 22above).* Excluding those who, though they are registered in the United Kingdom, are not, under our present law, exempted from immigration control.
25. The British Protected Persons who would qualify for citizenship in thisway would for the most part have come to this country from East Africa for permanent settlement, entering under the special voucher scheme. They wereadmitted because they faced the same problems as citizens of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies there, and for the purposes of the new citizenshipthere would seem to be no reason to treat them differently when they are settled in the United Kingdom.26. The origins of the status of British Subject without Citizenship are described above in paragraphs 4 and 7. The numbers who would be eligible forcitizenship through their residence in the United Kingdom must be very smallsince British Subjects without Citizenship who have made their home in theUnited Kingdom have been eligible for registration as citizens of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies since 1949 (for most of the time as of right).The impact of these changes on the right to live in the United Kingdom(a) Those who would acquire the right of entry for the first time27. British Citizenship would carry with it the right of entry to this country.So everyone who became a British Citizen under the transitional arrangements would have such a right of entry. But most of these people are already exempt from immigration control, and conferring British Citizenship on them wouldnot affect immigration to this country.28. There are, however, three groups who are not free from immigration control at present; they would therefore acquire the right of entry for the first time. There are those citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies from overseaswho have been resident here for less than five years, and their wives. But theyhave in most cases already been accepted for permanent residence. To grantthem citizenship would not commit the United Kingdom to accepting any newgroup of permanent residents. Then there are the British Protected Persons andthe British Subjects without Citizenship who have made their homes here; afew of the British Subjects without Citizenship are exempt from immigration control but generally they and the British Protected Persons are not exempt.But they, like the citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies mentionedabove, have for the most part already been accepted for permanent residence.They are here to stay; and to grant them British Citizenship with the right of entry to the United Kingdom would not involve any new immigration commit-ment.(b) Possible arrangements for those who have the right of entry but would not become British Citizens29. Some people who now have the right of entry to this country under the immigration Act 1971 would not become British Citizens if the law were amended as suggested above. These are: (i) citizens of a Commonwealth country with a parent (in practice almostinvariably the mother) who was a citizen of the United Kingdom and colonies by birth in the United Kingdom;(ii) women Commonwealth citizens who have the right of entry at presentbecause, and only because, their husbands have the right of entry;
(iii) citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies from overseas who were at one time settled in the United Kingdom and resident here for fiveyears, but who could not meet the residence qualifications for BritishCitizenship.Although it is intended that only British Citizens should have the right of entry to the United Kingdom, there might be a case for making some exceptions forthe people in these groups and allowing them to retain their present right of entry for their lifetimes.British Citizenship and the right of free movement within the European Community30. The establishment of a British Citizenship would make it necessary tore-examine in consultation with our partners, the present definition of UnitedKingdom national for European Community purposes. If the transitional arrangements suggested above were to be enacted, there would be some people who would become British Citizens but who have not the right of free movementunder the definition now in force. These would include those citizens of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies, British Protected Persons and British Subjectswithout Citizenship, who have been resident in the United Kingdom for lessthan five years and are settled here.Permanent arrangements31. These would be the arrangements for acquiring British Citizenship bybirth, descent or a voluntary act such as applying for naturalisation, once a new scheme of citizenship had come into force. There is a wide range of possible courses to be considered. Some ideas are set out below.(a) Citizenship by birth32. The United Kingdom, in common with the USA, Latin American andmany Commonwealth countries, at present confers citizenship on everyone whois born in the United Kingdom (or indeed in the Colonies), irrespective oftheir parents&apos; citizenship. In contrast, Continental countries confer theircitizenship on those born in their territories only if the child&apos;s parent is himself(or herself) a citizen of the country. These two methods of conferring citizenshipare known respectively as the ius soli and the ius sanguinis.33. The ius soli method traditionally used in the United Kingdom is simpleand inclusive. Anyone who is born here is a citizen unless his father is a diplomatof another country. This encourages the integration of people from abroad.The child born here to, say, Polish or Indian parents is a citizen of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies from birth; he is encouraged in this way to identifyhimself with this country. Under the ius sanguinis method he would have totake his parenfs nationality, and could acquire our citizenship only by somevoluntary act, such as naturalisation. It is possible, under such a system, forsuccessive generations to live in a country and never become citizens.34. On the other hand, some people might think that the ius soli method is too generous. It confers citizenship indiscriminately on all who happen to beborn here, even if, for instance, the mother is en route elsewhere. The problemscaused by transient visitors can, however, be exaggerated; a child born hereby accident is not likely, by and large, to exercise his claim to our citizenship.But it is true that we confer citizenship on children who, though born here, may
be brought up and live their lives abroad, and on children whose parents, thoughentirely unconnected with the United Kingdom, have arranged for the child tobe born here to acquire citizenship for its possible usefulness later. On the whole the Government consider that the simplicity and inclusiveness of the ius solimethod outweighs its drawbacks.(b) Citizenship by adoption35. Under the Adoption Acts 1958 and 1964 a child who is adopted in theUnited Kingdom (including, for this purpose, the Channel Islands and the isle of Man) automatically becomes a citizen of the United Kingdom and Coloniesif the person adopting the child is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies,or in the case of a joint adoption, the man is such a citizen.36. This principle might well be carried over into a new British Citizenship.But in the case of a joint adoption, it should suffice if either parent was a BritishCitizen. This would be in line with the Governments general policy of workingtowards equal treatment of the sexes.(c) Citizenship by descent37. Under United Kingdom law, as mentioned above, everyone who isborn here is automatically a citizen. So the only people who are citizens bydescent in our law are people born abroad who have some link with this countrythrough their fathers, which gives them a claim to our citizenship. In looking to the future, there are two main issues to be considered. First, whether thepresent inability of a woman to transmit her citizenship to her children bornabroad is justified. Second, how far citizenship by descent should be allowedto go that is, how many successive generations born abroad should be allowedto have our citizenship.Descent through the female line38. In the past, nearly all countries allowed only men citizens to transmittheir citizenship to their children born abroad. This was based on two arguments.First, countries were reluctant to see dual nationality proliferate as would happen when nationals of two countries married and both were able to transmittheir citizenship to their children. Second, in such &quot;mixed&quot; marriages it was thought that the man&apos;s occupation was crucial in deciding where the familywould live. The man would tend to work in his own country rather than his wife&apos;s; the family home would therefore be established there; the children ofthe marriage would grow up there and would inevitably associate themselvesmore strongly with their father&apos;s country than with their mother&apos;s.39. As to the first of these arguments, the United Kingdom has adopted avery tolerant attitude to dual nationality. The second argument is certainly nolonger so powerful or so generally accepted. Family patterns are altering; the woman&apos;s interests can be as important as the man&apos;s in deciding where the family home should be; in any case, families are more mobile. These changes have led a number of countries, including West Germany, Canada and the USA,to permit their women citizens to transmit their citizenship on broadly the same terms as men. In the United Kingdom much has been done to end discriminationon grounds of sex, and the Government consider that the opportunity shouldbe taken to do so in nationality law, by changing the rules for citizenship bydescent in a new scheme of citizenship.
40. There are, however, some practical problems. It would not be difficult to legislate so that, from a certain date, women could transmit their citizenship onthe same terms as men to children born after that date. But what about thechildren born before that date ? Should they be granted citizenship, and if so,how?41. To designate them all automatically as citizens, especially if the citizenshipwas back-dated to their birth, would cause difficulties. They might not want ourcitizenship; they might find that they had lost their other citizenship by havingour citizenship thrust upon them. An alternative favoured by the Government would be to enable a mother who had become a British Citizen to apply forher citizenship for her children. They would then hold this citizenship from thedate the application was granted. This arrangement might be for a limited period of, say, two years; this has been the practice in other countries whichhave changed their law recently in this way (e.g. Canada and West Germany).The limits of citizenship by descent42. Our present law not only confines to men the right to transmit citizenship,it also imposes conditions on the transmission of citizenship. There is no restriction on men citizens from this country transmitting their citizenship tothe first generation born abroad. But beyond that, citizenship may be trans-mitted only in certain circumstances, for instance, if the father is in BritishGovernment service at the time of the child&apos;s birth, or if the child is born in aforeign (but not a Commonwealth) country and the child&apos;s birth is registered,within a limited time, at a British Consulate. There is no limit to the transmission of citizenship to further generations in these circumstances.43. These arrangements have grown up in a somewhat haphazard fashion,and can lead to anomalies. It seems odd to many people that a child born in,say, the USA, can be given his father&apos;s citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies by Consular registration if his father was born abroad, but a childborn in Canada in similar circumstances cannot. A child born in Australia to aBritish diplomat who was himself born overseas acquires his father&apos;s citizenship,but a child born there to a British businessman in similar circumstances does not.A new citizenship would provide an opportunity to place the rules for descenton a more rational basis.44. There are various options. At one extreme, if the United Kingdom wereto adopt the his sanguinis method and confer citizenship on any child whoseparent was a citizen, there could be no limits on transmission, no matter howdistant were the child&apos;s direct connections with the United Kingdom. TheUnited Kingdom has, however, been traditionally reluctant to extend itscitizenship in this way; people have emigrated from this country in considerable numbers for at least the last 200 years, and the descendants of such peopleusually associate themselves with their country of birth, and not with theUnited Kingdom.45. The other extreme would be to limit citizenship to the first generationborn abroad and not allow people born overseas to transmit their citizenshipto children born overseas. This might be necessary if, as is suggested, citizenshipis to carry with it the right to enter the United Kingdom. Without such ameasure there would be large and growing numbers of people abroad who
had the right to come to the United Kingdom at any time, but who mighthave scant connection with this country. The numbers would, of course, beall the greater if women as well as men could transmit their citizenship totheir children born abroad.46. But more and more people are spending part of their careers abroad andit might seem unfair if one member of a family who happened to be born whenthe family was temporarily overseas could not transmit his citizenship when hisbrothers (and sisters) who were born in the United Kingdom could do so.Difficulty would arise where such a person was in his turn temporarily abroadserving United Kingdom interests when his children were born. He might havefew ties with the country of his own birth, or of his children&apos;s birth. It would benatural for him to want to transmit British Citizenship to his children bornoverseas. Further difficulty could arise where the person concerned had no claimto citizenship of the country in which he was born as, for instance, is invariablythe case with the children of diplomats and so could not transmit the citizen-ship of that country to his children even if he wished to. The government consider that as a general rule a new British Citizenship should not be trans-mitted beyond the first generation born abroad, but they recognise that some circumstances might justify exceptions.(d) Citizenship by voluntary act47. The present arrangements for acquiring citizenship by voluntary act,for example, registration and naturalisation, are extremely complicated andvaried. Some people have an outright entitlement to registration notablywomen who are, or who have at any time been, married to citizens of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies, and Commonwealth citizens who have been settled here continuously since 1 January 1973 and have completed five years&apos;ordinary residence. Others can be granted citizenship at the discretion of theHome Secretary, provided they meet various conditions relating to residence,good character, knowledge of the language, and intentions as to residence inthe United Kingdom; these include all foreign nationals and those Common-wealth citizens who do not qualify for citizenship as an entitlement. (There arespecial provisions for Pakistanis to be treated, for a limited time, as if they were still Commonwealth citizens when applying for citizenship.) There is also pro-vision for Irish citizens, and for stateless persons connected with this country;and for certain people who have renounced citizenship of the United Kingdomand Colonies to resume it. The Home Secretary has virtually unrestrictedpowers to register any minor child as a citizen of the United Kingdom and colonies, at his discretion. The discussion that follows does not cover all these various categories but concentrates on the areas where there are special problems.Citizenship by virtue of marriage48. As indicated above, under our present law, women who have at any time been married to citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies are entitled toacquire their husbands&apos; citizenship, on application. But men married to womencitizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies have no such right to their wives&apos;citizenship; they must apply in the usual way for registration or naturalisation.
49. This runs contrary to the Governments general policy of ending dis-crimination between the sexes. But there is considerable room for argument on how changes might be made. Registration on these grounds under the present law gives a woman the right of entry to the United Kingdom, and to extend theright to men in the same way would inevitably have repercussions on immigra-tion; in particular, the possibility that bogus marriages might thereby be encouraged cannot be ignored. It is of interest that some other countries whichhave granted husbands rights similar to those enjoyed by wives to acquirenationality by virtue of marriage (for example, West Germany, Denmark andthe USA) have found it necessary to place some restriction on the right toacquire citizenship in this way, e.g., by a qualifying period of residence.50. Four possible options, with some comments on them, are given below: (i) to give men married to citizens the same entitlement to citizenshipwhich women who are married to citizens now enjoy. This would&quot;level up&quot; the sexes by enabling a woman citizen of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies to confer on her foreign husband the samebenefit as a man can confer on his foreign wife, and would moreadequately recognise the equal status of women in marriage. But sucha provision could, as indicated above, have some undesirable conse-quences. Because any Commonwealth citizen or foreign nationalwould be able to acquire citizenship and the right of entry to theUnited Kingdom simply through marriage to a British Citizen,there could be an encouragement to bogus marriages, particularly where a foreigner was aware of being in danger of deportation (whichhis acquisition of citizenship would prevent) and, more generally, to securing entry ostensibly for some temporary purpose but really witha view to marriage and permanent settlement. Accordingly, a provisionof this kind might have to include a reserve power to refuse citizenshipin certain circumstances;(ii) to give spouses of both sexes married to citizens an entitlement tocitizenship, but make this subject to a residence requirement ofperhaps three years;(iii) to treat spouses of citizens on exactly the same terms as otherapplicants for citizenship. This would mean that wives would haveto qualify for citizenship in the same way that husbands do. It mightbe said that marriage should not of itself entitle anyone male orfemale to take his or her spouse&apos;s citizenship, particularly if the marriage no longer subsists, and that we should not assume thata spouse is automatically fitted for citizenship or that he or she isprepared to identify with this country; but that spouses of each sexshould be treated on their merits;(iv) to treat spouses of citizens on the same terms as other applicants forcitizenship, but to give both sexes some concession in the matter of residence perhaps by requiring only three years, instead of thenormal five, for naturalisation. This would ensure that marriage toa citizen brought a real advantage without giving the unqualifiedentitlement which at present is conferred on women but not on men.This would be broadly in line with the approach which has beenadopted by a number of other countries which have recently revisedtheir nationality laws.
Citizenship by naturalisation51. Under our present law, foreign nationals who seek naturalisation haveto satisfy the Home Secretary, amongst other things, that they have residedhere for at least five years; that they are of good character; that they have asufficient knowledge of English; and that they intend, once naturalised, toremain here or linked to British interests abroad. Many commonwealth citizens have an entitlement to citizenship and have to show only that theyhave been ordinarily resident here for five years. But increasing numbers are having to meet similar requirements see paragraph 47 to those for naturalisation-tion (Commonwealth citizens apply for registration, not naturalisation). Thereis no appeal against refusal of either naturalisation or registration.52. There are three aspects of the procedure on which the Government willparticularly welcome views-the good character requirement, the languagetest and the absence of an appeals system..The good character requirement53. The requirement that applicants for naturalisation must be of goodcharacter is long-established. Over the years, records of what constitutes goodcharacter have been carefully kept, and the doctrine has been modified fromtime to time as society&apos;s views of acceptable behaviour and attitudes have changed. But the requirement is imprecise. It is after all easier to say thatsomeone is of good character than to analyse why this is so. Different people are bound to have different views of what constitutes good character. Everyeffort is made to treat applicants consistently and fairly in this matter, but it isnot always easy to administer the good character requirement satisfactorily.54. But, equally, it is not easy to devise an adequate substitute. One way would be to limit consideration of character to criminal and financial matters.It might be said that someone was acceptable for naturalisation who had never been convicted of a criminal offence (with some exceptions), who was notawaiting trial for any offence, and who was not an undischarged bankrupt or aperson barred from acting as a director under the Companies Act. The exceptedcriminal offences might be, first, those which are &quot;spent&quot; under the rehabilitation-tion of Offenders Act 1974; and, second, offences which led to a custodialsentence of more than 30 months (and which cannot therefore be &quot;spent&quot;under the 1974 Act) where the applicant completed his sentence not less than10 years before applying for naturalisation.55. But there would obviously have to be some reserve power to deal withapplicants who were unsuitable on grounds of national security or the preser-vation of law and order.56. Even so, an objective test like criminal offences has its drawbacks. Itcannot measure, for instance, whether a man&apos;s general behaviour makes himunacceptable to his fellow-citizens, even though he may have kept free of thecourts. And, if a man makes himself unacceptable to his fellow-citizens in thisway, he may be a full citizen in law but he will be a second-class citizen in fact.He will not enjoy the equal status that, by and large, naturalised citizens nowpossess, and the process of naturalisation may be devalued. Perhaps more
sophisticated objective tests are needed, or the concept of good character loose and vague as it is should be retained. The Government will welcomeviews on this matter.The language test57. The present law requires that applicants for naturalisation should havea sufficient knowledge of English (or, for discretionary registration, which was introduced in 1973, English or Welsh). Nowadays, it is usually sufficient for theapplicant to have an adequate command of spoken English. Such factors as theage and ability of the applicant are taken into account in assessing this. most countries have similar provisions in their naturalisation laws. It is, after all,difficult for a naturalised citizen to exercise his civic duties, for instance, to voteor sit on juries, if he does not understand the language of his adopted country.It is difficult indeed for him to be accepted as a sufficiently integrated memberof our society if he cannot communicate with his fellow-citizens. Moreover,some knowledge of the language is an indication that the applicant has com-mitted himself to living here and taking part in the life of the community.58. Against this, however, it is argued that elderly applicants in particularcan find it difficult to meet the language test. They may lead restricted lives,largely amongst their own fellow-countrymen, and the range of civic dutiesthat they could effectively perform would probably be small. They may, none-theless, be anxious to acquire citizenship, particularly if they are stateless or ofuncertain nationality. One solution might be to keep the language test but givethe Home Secretary some discretion to waive it in such cases.An appeals system59. As mentioned above, those who are refused citizenship by registration ornaturalisation cannot at present appeal against the refusal. Admittedly, adecision to refuse citizenship usually has little immediate impact on the everydaylife of the applicant; it does not affect his ability to stay in this country, and he isfree, for instance, to own property. But refusal might prevent someone from entering a post, such as those in the Civil Service, which is restricted to thoseholding certain nationalities. A right of appeal could offer some help in sucha case.60. On the other hand, it is questionable whether it would be apt to have anappeals system if good character, assessed in each case by analysing all the factors involved, were to remain the criterion for citizenship. The diversity of circum-stances encountered in applications is very wide. The judgements which haveto be made in this area are essentially subjective, and matters of this kind arenot easily justiciable. It is for consideration how far it would be an improvementto substitute the views of adjudicators for those of the Home Secretary and his advisers. Under the present system the standards applied in the generality ofcases can be, and are, modified, and exceptions made to them, where this seemsjustified. But if good character were to be replaced by objective tests the scopeof a right of appeal would be small. The only issues that would then come toan appeal would be the length of an applicants residence in this country or hisfuture intentions. Applicants who were refused on security and similar groundscould not in any case be given a right of appeal, because of the difficulty ofdisclosing in public the information that had led to the refusal.
(e) Dual nationality61. United Kingdom law contains no bar on the holding of dual nationality.Of the citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who have other citizenships,some have obtained them by naturalisation in other countries, but the majorityhave them by reason of their descent. In particular, the close links betweenfamilies in the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic have led to much dualcitizenship. Most other countries place restrictions on the holding of othercitizenships in addition to their own. Nearly all Commonwealth countries, forinstance, withdraw citizenship from those who voluntarily acquire the citizenship of another country, taking the view that those who, of their own free will,acquire the citizenship of another country should lose their original citizenshipsince they have sought and obtained the protection of another State. Some ofthese countries made provision to this effect on first attaining independence,while others which formerly allowed their citizens to hold another nationalityhave changed their law. Equally, many countries require applicants fornaturalisation to renounce their former nationality as evidence of their commit-ment to their new country. Others extend the ban on dual nationality further,to those who have acquired it involuntarily say, through parents of differentnationalities who are both able to transmit their citizenship. Usually such countries allow the child to remain a dual national until he is of age, and then he has to decide within a specified time which citizenship he intends to hold,and renounce the other; if he fails to make a choice he automatically forfeitsthe citizenship of the country concerned.62. If the United Kingdom decided to tighten its law on dual nationality,there are thus various options: (i) a complete ban on dual nationality where it arises either voluntarily(by naturalisation, etc.) or involuntarily (by descent, for instance),with some arrangement for children who are dual nationals to make a choice when they become of age;(ii) a ban on dual nationality where it arises voluntarily our citizens who voluntarily took another citizenship would thereby lose ourcitizenship, and applicants for our citizenship would have to renounceany other citizenship as a condition of becoming citizens;(iii) a ban on dual nationality only where our citizens voluntarily acquiredanother nationality (as was the practice in United Kingdom law from1870-1948).63. To ban dual nationality completely would be complicated and expensive.A record would have to be kept of all children born both in the United Kingdomand abroad who had another nationality in addition to ours. When suchchildren came of age they would have to be advised of the need to choose, andthe time limit for doing so. In view of the large numbers of people from thiscountry living abroad, and of people from other countries living in the UnitedKingdom, this would be an immense task, and it is very doubtful whethereveryone affected could be covered. The alternative would be to rely on theindividual remembering to make a choice, but this could lead to hardship wherethe individual inadvertently lost his citizenship by failing to do so; there wouldprobably have to be elaborate machinery to exempt such persons, and this could also be expensive. Admittedly, there are bound to be more dual nationalsif women are able to transmit their citizenship to their children born abroad
on the same terms as men, but it is doubtful whether this increase would justify a complete ban on dual nationality, with all its attendant problems.After all, most of the children born abroad to British women would probablydecide for themselves which nationality they wanted to use.64. A ban on dual nationality where it arises from a voluntary act would not present so many problems. It could indeed be part of the clearer and betterdefined British Citizenship for which we are aiming. Some foreign and Common-wealth citizens might be reluctant to give up their citizenship on acquiring ours,though at present many do so automatically under their own country&apos;s laws,but it would be difficult to justify setting a more severe standard for our owncitizens who want to acquire a foreign or Commonwealth citizenship than forforeign and Commonwealth nationals who want to acquire our citizenship. Weshould require the same degree of commitment from both groups.65. Some concessions, however, might perhaps be made in connection withmarriage, so that, for instance, those who apply for British Citizenship, oracquire another by virtue of marriage, might be allowed to keep both theircitizenships (provided the laws of the other country concerned permit this).Such persons would then still have the right of entry to their country of originif the marriage failed.(f) Civic privileges66. An important aspect of citizenship is the privileges associated with it. Inthis country the common status of British subject, held in our law not only bycitizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies but by all other commonwealth citizens, carries with it voting and other privileges. There are also special arrangements for citizens of the Irish Republic. Such privileges do not stemdirectly from the law of nationality and so are not dealt with in this document.A BRITISH OVERSEAS CITIZENSHIPTransitional arrangements67. The core of this status would be those who have ties with an existingdependency. The status might therefore be conferred in the first place on thosecitizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies born, naturalised or registered inan existing dependency, or whose fathers were so born, naturalised or registered.Some of these people might be eligible for British Citizenship too, in one of the ways described in paragraphs 19-23; but in general only British OverseasCitizens would have a right of entry to a dependency so it is important that any british Citizen suitably connected with a dependency should hold british overseas Citizenship as well in order to secure his right of entry there.68. The transitional arrangements would also have to cover all other citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies who do not become British Citizens.These hold their present citizenship for a variety of reasons. Some have con-connections with the United Kingdom or existing dependencies, but of so remote a nature as not to bring them within the qualifications for British Citizenship,or those for British Overseas Citizenship suggested in paragraph 67. most people in this group, however, would have acquired citizenship of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies through their links with a former dependency, and
would have no links by birth or ancestry with either the United Kingdom oran existing dependency.69. One other group of people eligible to hold British passports might alsobecome British Overseas Citizens. These are British Protected Persons who are connected with former dependencies and who would not become BritishCitizens; nearly all of them would be living overseas.70. The creation of a British Overseas Citizenship with no right of entry intothe United Kingdom would not affect the responsibility which the Governmenthave assumed towards holders of United Kingdom passports from East Africa,and the special voucher scheme would continue.Permanent arrangementsLinking the citizenship to the right of entry to a dependency71. The arrangements for acquiring British Overseas Citizenship after a newcitizenship scheme came into force by birth, descent or voluntary act mightbe so drawn that we would eventually reach a state of affairs in which british overseas Citizenship would be derived solely from connection with the dependencies which still exist, and would confer the right of entry to one ofthem. If this were not done, there would still be many British Overseas Citizensscattered over the world in a hundred years&apos; time with the right of entry neitherto the United Kingdom nor to a dependency. The rules for acquiring andtransmitting British Overseas Citizenship would have to take account of thedifficulties faced by dependencies and the pressure on their resources, which means that they can give the right of entry only to those who have very closeties with them. They could not radically alter these arrangements; there couldnot, for example, be an understanding that a British Overseas Citizen could go to live in any dependency he might choose unless he had such ties with it.72. Accordingly, it seems inevitable that the standards for British OverseasCitizenship should differ from those for British Citizenship. British Citizenshipcould not be adjusted so as to follow the limits proposed for British OverseasCitizenship; the shape of British Citizenship could hardly be determined by thelimits placed by dependencies on those with a right of entry to them. On theother hand it would be fruitless to provide that British Overseas Citizenshipshould follow British Citizenship in all respects. To do so would simply mean that some people who would acquire British Overseas Citizenship, for examplethrough birth to a woman from a dependency, would find that they had no right of entry to the dependency from which their status was derived. Moreover,if British Overseas Citizenship is to be confined to those who &quot;belong&quot; to the dependencies, the arrangements for holding it must reflect the outlook andattitudes of the peoples of the dependencies, and these are bound to differ from those of the people of the United Kingdom.73. In general, therefore, the long-term aim ought to be to confine british overseas Citizenship to those with a right of entry to a dependency. To takefirst of all the arrangements for transmission of citizenship, it ought not to passautomatically to a child born outside a dependency unless the father is a citizenby birth, registration or naturalisation in an existing dependency. This would,of course, mean that some British Overseas Citizens would be able to transmitcitizenship to their children while others would not. There could be some minor exceptions to the general rule. For example, it might be right to include
a provision for conferring citizenship on the stateless child of a British OverseasCitizen, once the child had established a direct connection with a dependency byliving there for, say, three years. Second, women from the dependencies mightonly be able to transmit citizenship to their children born abroad where the child was illegitimate. This is because dependencies might be reluctant to grant the right of entry to the legitimate child from abroad when the mother was aBritish Overseas Citizen but the father was not. Third, there would probably have to be an arrangement to meet international obligations to grant citizenship(on certain conditions) to wives. Although these obligations would have to betaken into account they should not significantly weaken the general principlesunderlying the citizenship.74. It would also be necessary, because of the need to relate British OverseasCitizenship to the right of entry to a dependency, for the arrangements fornaturalisation in the dependencies to remain much the same as at present, theapplicant having to fulfil certain minimum requirements of residence, etc., butbeyond that the grant of naturalisation being entirely at discretion.THE STATUS OF THE IRISH75. In general, Irish citizens born before 1949 were also British subjects inour law until the Act of 1948 came into force. Since then, those Irish citizenshave been eligible to claim, by means of written notice to the Home Secretary,to remain British subjects under a special provision of the Act. Within a newnationality scheme they could continue to be eligible to hold British passports.They and other Irish citizens settled in the United Kingdom would be eligibleon the same terms as citizens of Commonwealth and foreign countries to apply for British Citizenship.CONCLUSION76. The Government think that change on the general lines set out above would offer a more rational basis not only for citizenship but also for immigra-tion control. In time, the complex distinctions that now govern the right of entry to the United Kingdom would disappear and citizenship would become the test. The people of the United Kingdom would enjoy a more meaningfulstatus than at present, and the present inequalities between men and women inour nationality law would be removed.77. Overseas, there are some different considerations to be taken into account.Those citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies and other persons eligible to hold British passports now alive who do not have ties with the United King-dom or an existing dependency would, as British Overseas Citizens, continueto be eligible for British passports during their lifetimes (or until they tookanother citizenship voluntarily). But, because of the restrictions on acquiringthis status after the scheme started, their numbers would not grow as at present.78. Those who have close ties with our remaining dependencies would hold acitizenship that properly reflected this relationship.79. The ideas in this paper are put forward as a basis for discussion. TheGovernment are not bound by them nor committed to them in their present form. But it is hoped that they will provide a framework for the full and informedpublic discussion that these complex issues merit.
GLOSSARY1. This glossary is intended merely as an explanation of the various terms and expressions used in the paper; it has no legal authority as an interpretation of those terms or expressions, and in particular, when referring to the holders of a nationality status it assumes that the persons concerned have not renouncedor forfeited it.2. The following terms and expressions are used in the British NationalityActs.(a) British subject/Commonwealth citizenThese terms are synonymous. Citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies and citizens of the independent Commonwealth countries allhold the additional status of British subject/Commonwealth citizen.There are also persons whose basic status is British subject and who donot possess the citizenship of any Commonwealth country (see referencesbelow to British Subjects without Citizenship, British subjects by virtueof section 2 of the British Nationality Act 1948, and British subjects by virtue of section 1 of the British Nationality Act 1965).(b) Citizen of the United Kingdom and ColoniesThis status is held by:(i) persons who, or whose fathers, were born, naturalised, orregistered under the British Nationality Acts in the UnitedKingdom, the Channel Islands or Isle of Man, or in any of theremaining colonies (except Southern Rhodesia, which since 1950has had its own citizenship), or in any of the Associated states in the West Indies;(ii) persons born in foreign countries whose fathers were citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies by descent and whosebirths have been registered at a British Consulate;(iii) persons who, or whose fathers, derive their citizenship from aconnection with a former colony or other dependency but who did not acquire the new country&apos;s citizenship automatically atindependence;(iv) certain persons who have been adopted in the United Kingdom bya citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies.(c) British Subject without CitizenshipBritish Subjects without Citizenship are persons born before 1 January1949 who were British subjects by reason of their connection withformer British India but did not become citizens of India or Pakistanwhen those countries introduced their own citizenships after independence, usually because they were not living in one of them atthe time (see also paragraphs 4 and 7 of the paper).(d) British subjects by virtue of section 2 of the British Nationality Act 1948These are citizens of the Republic of Ireland, born before 1 January1949, who were then British subjects and have remained British subjectsby making a formal claim under section 2 of the 1948 Act.
(e) British subjects by virtue of section 1 of the British Nationality Act 1965These are women who have been registered as British subjects underthe 1965 Act by reason of their marriage to a British subject withoutcitizenship ((c) above) or a British subject by virtue of section 2 of the1948 Act ((d) above).(/) British Protected PersonsBritish Protected Persons are not British subjects/commonwealth citizens; nor are they aliens. Most of them are connected by birth ordescent with the one remaining British protectorate (the SolomonIslands) or are nationals of Brunei. Some are persons who were con-nected with former protectorates or former trust territories but havenot become citizens of those countries.(g) AliensAn alien is a person who is not:(i) a British subject/Commonwealth citizen;(ii) a British Protected Person; or(iii) a citizen of the Republic of Ireland.The term &quot;foreigner&quot; has no meaning in British nationality law, thoughnowadays it is generally preferred to the term &quot;alien&quot;. Other expressionssuch as &quot;British citizen&quot;, &quot;British national&quot;, &quot;United Kingdom citizen&quot;,and &quot;citizen of the United Kingdom&quot;, although commonly used, haveno meaning in current nationality law.3. The expression &quot;United Kingdom national for European Communitypurposes&quot; is not defined in current nationality law it covers persons who: -(a) have a national status as at 2(b), (c), (d) or (e) above, and who havethe right of abode in the United Kingdom and are therefore exempt from United Kingdom immigration control;(b) are citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies by birth or byregistration or naturalisation in Gibraltar, or whose fathers were soborn, registered or naturalised.Printed in England for Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office by Harrison &amp; Sons (London)21615  Dd 161837  K48  4/77
