DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 38 COPY NO        0 026 April 1977CABINETDIRECT ELECTIONS TO THE EUROPEAN ASSEMBLYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentINTRODUCTION1. At our last meeting (CM(77) 16th Conclusions), I was invited to bring forward to Cabinet, in the light of the Parliamentary debate on 20 and25 April, proposals on the electoral system to be used for direct elections to the European Assembly and related issues, as a basis for therecommendations to be made to the Parliamentary Labour Party.ELECTORAL system. It is clear from the debate that the options remain as outlined in ourWhite Paper (Cmnd 6768):a. Simple Majority System: The Parliamentary debate has confirmed that there is considerable support for the simple majoritysystem in various quarters.    The Liberal Party are, however,still very strongly opposed to it and would fight a Simple MajorityBill (and the ensuing Boundary Commission proposals) vigorously.b. Single Transferable Vote (STV):  The Liberal Party&apos;s firstpreference is for STV;  and some other speakers have shown support for it.    The main disadvantage of STV relates to the complexity ofcounting the votes in very large STV constituencies.    This mightbe overcome by reducing the size of the proposed STVconstituencies;  but this in turn could introduce the complication oftime-consuming Boundary Commission procedures.c. Regional Lists:  There has been some support for thissystem on the Labour back benches and from Conservatives.    TheLiberal Party has privately indicated that they would acquiesce in a regional list system as outlined in Annex B to the White Paper.    the regional list system would prevent a disproportionate swing in1
mid-term elections, would avoid the need for Boundary Commissionprocedures and would be reasonably similar to the electoralsystems to be used for direct elections by most other european economic Community (e.c.) countries.    It would also emphasise the difference between European and Westminster elections.3. The White Paper proposed that Northern Ireland should in any case have a Gystem of Proportional Representation (PR).    This could be STVif the rest of the United Kingdom has the simple majority system or STV.If the rest of the United Kingdom has a regional list system, NorthernIreland would have the same system.    The Conservatives consider thatthe same system should be used throughout the United Kingdom.4. The debate showed very little support for the compulsory dualmandate.    I therefore recommend that we should propose the optionaldual mandate, ie Members of Parliament and others would be eligible to stand as candidates for the European Assembly.PROCEDURE IN HOUSE OF COMMONSAffirmative Resolution5.        At some stage it will be necessary to move an affirmative resolution on a draft Order in Council under section 1(3) of the european communities Act 1972 to designate the Decision of September 1976 on direct elections as a Community Treaty.    This could take place beforeSecond Reading of the Bill and would provide an opportunity for a vote onthe principle of direct elections, but not on the electoral system.Alternatively, the Resolution could be moved (like a money resolution)immediately after the Second Reading Vote or it could be delayed until thelegislation giving effect to the Decision has been enacted.Preliminary Vote on Electoral System6. It would be possible to have a preliminary vote on the electoralsystem before the Bill is introduced.    This is what the Conservatives have asked for and it would have the advantage of tidiness.    The Liberals are,however, strongly opposed to this course, because they fear it may leadto a simple majority system outcome.TIMING OF LEGISLATION7.        A Bill on direct elections will be keenly fought in Parliament.    If theParties are to have time to prepare for elections in May/June 1978 the Billmust receive Royal Assent by the end of this year.    We are committed byThe Queen&apos;s Speech to introduce legislation in the present Session;  and ifthere is to be no overspill period in the autumn this means that we only have some 10 weeks in which to complete the legislative process.2
8. A simple majority Bill has already been drafted.    If this Billreceived Royal Assent by early August there would be time for the boundary commissions to make recommendations by the end of the year on the constituency boundaries, following one round of representations (but nolocal inquiries) as envisaged under Option B in paragraph 30 of the white paper.9. Work is in hand on a regional list Bill, but I understand that becauseof the complexity and novelty of the task it will take several weeks toprovide a comprehensive Bill.    If we decide to have a regional list systemit will in any case be necessary for me to put a further paper to mycolleagues on various important issues arising under this system, such aswhether electors should vote for one named candidate as proposed in annex B to the White Paper;  what the regional boundaries should be; and what arrangements should be made for nominations, deposits, mid-termvacancies, and the allocation of seats.    These matters will require urgentdecision if we are to be able to move forward quickly.    Provided that wedispense with Boundary Commission procedures (e. g. by adopting theeconomic planning regions as our electoral areas) Royal Assent by the endof the year would enable us to meet the target date for the elections; butif legislation were not completed before the end of the present Session itwould fall.10.        I have considered the possibility of an outline regional list bill which would leave the detailed provisions (e. g. on the issues referred toin paragraph 9 above) for regulations.    Such a Bill could be ready in a week or so and would provide an opportunity for the House to reach a decision onthe electoral system;  but the difficulty of getting the House to agree tothis procedure is such that I would not recommend it.11.        An STV Bill would present less novelty, bearing in mind that thesystem is already in use in Northern Ireland.    Such a Bill could be draftedquite quickly, but if it became necessary for the constituencies to bedetermined by the Boundary Commission (see paragx-aph 2b. above), theBill would need to receive Royal Assent by early August.    Moreover thereis little support for STV, except among the Liberals.12.       I am advised that if we introduce a simple majority Bill and, as aresult of a free vote, had to change to a regional list system the changesmight be so extensive that it would be necessary to withdraw the Bill andintroduce a new one.    If we introduced a regional list Bill it might be easier to amend this to the simple majority system which is alreadyfamiliar to the House.    It is difficult to forecast what the attitude of theHouse authorities might be on this point, and we would not know this forcertain until all the necessary provisions had been drafted.3
CONCLUSIONS13.        There is a view that before a Bill is introduced the House should begiven an opportunity to vote on the principle of direct elections.    Thedanger of such a debate is that it would underline and intensify the divisionon the principle within the Parliamentary Labour Party.    There will bean opportunity to debate the principle on Second Reading of the Bill.14.        The opinions expressed in the debate, our own previous discussions and my exchanges with the Liberal Party suggest to me that the electoralsystem that ought to be used is the regional list system;  but its precise form needs to be speedily agreed if we are to meet the Parliamentarytimetable.15.        There are arguments for and against having a free vote on the electoral system prior to the introduction of a Bill.    Such a course wouldhave the advantage that the Bill could be based on an electoral systempreviously agreed by the House.    The main disadvantage of this course is that it would lose us Liberal support and could result in a majority infavour of the first past the post system with the extra problem of time.On balance I am against a prior vote on the electoral system.16.        I invite my colleagues to agree that the recommendations to be put to the Parliamentary Labour Party should be that:a. The Bill should incorporate a regional list electoral system for the whole of the United Kingdom, with optional dual mandate.b. Debate on the principle of direct elections should be deferred until the Second Reading of the Bill.c. There should be a free vote on the electoral system duringthe Committee stage.M RHome Office26 April 19774
