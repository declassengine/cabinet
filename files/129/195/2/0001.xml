THE DUAL MANDATENote by OfficialsIntroductionThis note sets out briefly the concept of a compulsory dual mandate and itsrelationship with simultaneous elections to the Assembly and the WestminsterParliament (paragraph 2).    (An optional dual mandate raises no problems,merely specifying that MPs should not be excluded from standing for theEuropean Assembly; so the dual mandate r preferred to in this note is a compulsory dual mandate).The advantages of these arrangements   (paragraphs 3 and A)Their disadvantages   (paragraph 5)Practical considerations   (paragraph 6)and Conclusions   (paragraph 7).THE CONCEPT2.     The essence of a dual mandate (defined as above) is that membership ofthe House of Commons would be an essential condition for membership of theAssembly.   This could be linked with either -a. simultaneous elections to the Assembly and the WestminsterParliament, orb. separate elections on a common date with our European partners but with candidates drawn from the House of Commons. This note deals first with a.ADVANTAGES3&apos;     The advantages of a dual mandate are -a.     it would ensure that United Kingdom Assembly members had as their primary base their position at Westminster and in their Westminsterconstituencies; it would thus preserve the primacy of Westminster;
b. it would minimise divergences between Assembly members and otherWestminscer members of the same party;c. it would limit the intrusion on the British scene of Europeanparties with their own programmes which might rival our national parties and promote federalism,4.     Simultaneous Assembly and Westminster elections would have additionaladvantages -a. they would avoid mid-term elections which might produce resultswidely divergent from those of the previous general election and thusundermine the position of the Government in power, though they would entail mid-term changes in our representation in the Assembly;b. they would be more calculated to produce a reasonable turn out than an election in mid-term for which the public interest and the turn outmight be unfortunately low.    (in the last three general elections the turn out has never been below 70 per cent.   In local elections it israrely above A.0 per cent.   In some parts of the country - particularlyinner urban areas - local election turn out can bo below 20 per cent).DISADVANTAGES5.     The disadvantages of a dual mandate are -a. it would impose considerable strain on Assembly members.   It canbe argued that this would be no greater than the strain on Ministers.But Assembly members would be less able to play their full V/estminsterrole than other members and British Assembly members with a dual mandatewould be less able to cope than other members.   A dual mandate would be easier for Members with constituencies affording easy communication withWestminster and the Continent.b. Simultaneous Assembly and Westminster Elections would be in breachthe agreement on direct elections which we signed in Bruasels with* ^er Member States in September 1 976 and which provided for a common^e^ates (between a Thursday and a Sunday) to be settled later
e com-m(with May/June 1978 mentioned in the preamble as a target for the best endeavours of all).   It would be clear from the start that the legislation was incompatible with the target date or with any common date agreed in advance.   The French would argue that in those circumstances theCommunity could not proceed to Direct Elections.PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS6*     A number of practical considerations which need to be borne in mindwould flow from       aecisicn in principle to establish a dual mandatbined with simultaneous elections.a.    Voting in the Euro-Assembly and at WestminsterHow could the impact of sudden absences of 81 MPs on voting in theHouse of Commons be dealt with?   There would be criticisms boththe United Kingdom and within the Nine more generally if Assemblymembers were unable to conduct their House of Commons businessproperly (or if they were unable to play their full part in theAssembly).   To deal with this three possibilities arise.i. Proxy voting at WestminsterProxy voting is open to the objection that members were votingwithout having fully weighed the arguments in debate, though if in fact the United Kingdom contingent arrived back in Westminsterjust in time to vote they would not have been able to listen tothe debate anyway (onco proceedings of Westminster are televisedit will be technically possible to relay them in the case of importantdebates).   But proxy voting would certainly cause difficulties bydisturbing long-established conventions.ii. Proxy voting in the AssemblyFroxy voting at the Assembly is of course open to similar practicalobjections as at Westminster (and its disadvantages could bomitigated by tho same means) and it would be an innovation there too -hut an innovation insignificant compared with tho introduction of direct elections themselves.   It would probably therefore be more acceptable.
iii.    Automatic pairing at WestminsterA high proportion of Assembly members would be able to pair with each other, and arrangements for the automatic pairing of thesurplus of majority party members over minority party members wouldpose no complications of administration.b.     Simultaneous electionsThe combination of simultaneous elections with a dual mandate wouldrequire special electoral arrangements for Assembly members.   Although itis probable that most successful candidates in Assembly constituoncieswould also be   successful in the Westminster constituencies, and would therefore be able to take their seats in Strasbourg, provision wouldbave to be made to deal with two contingencies which could arise -i. where a successful Assembly candidate and member of themajority party at Westminster was appointed a Minister in her Majesty&apos;s Government; and ii. less likely, but possible - where a successful Assemblycandidate failed to gain election in his Westminster constituency.either of these cases arrangements would have to be made for alternates toaPPointed.   Two possible methods present themselves -a*     Alternative preference for votersVoters Could be invited to list their preferences for candidates, on thebasis that &quot;if ;x cannot take his seat who would you then choose?&quot;   ThisG0uld be expected to work but there would be no guarantee that anycandidates in any one Euro-constituency would be qualified to take hisseat.b*    Parliamentary party pool of candidatesTbe more feasible alternative would be to draw alternates from a list ofPs held by each parliamentary political party0   It would be made clear0n th-o ballot paper that in voting for a named candidate electors were also doting for the right of the candidate&apos;s party to appoint analternate if contingencies i. and ii. above arose, or for example where^ Assembly member later resigned his Westminster seat.In
6.     The alternative mentioned in paragraph 2.b. ef Assembly electxons wxtha dual mandate but eendueted separately from Westminster elections wouldrequire all candidates to be members of the House of Commons.   This wouldovercome the major difficulty of incompatibility with our ouligatxons(paragraph 5.b.) and the difficulty of immediate disqualification (para-graph 5.0.)).   The choice of electoral system would be open unless a shortageof candidates for 81 constituencies made it necessary to resort to regxonalor national lists.   Assembly members who subsequently lost their tfcstmxnsterscats would however be disqualified and there would still be the problem ofmid-term changes in our representation in the Assembly.CONCLUSIONS7-     a.    k dual nandate linked to simultaneous Assembly and WestminsterElections would be the most effective way of minimising the impact of directelections on our Parliamentary system, our party system, and the position ofthe Government in office.   It would be attractive to many Members.   Butlegislation on this basis would be seen as incompatible with any agreement to hold direct elections on a common date.b-    A dual mandate linked to the election of Assembly members from the Houseof Co^ns could be compatible with direct elections in May/Juno 1978 while&quot;till preserving to a large degree the advantages of a.   In comparison wxth*. it would avoid the problem of immediate disqualification though not theP^blon of mid-term changes on our Assembly representation.   But Ixke a.^ would still impose strains on dual members and present voting problemsat Westminster.11 March19775
