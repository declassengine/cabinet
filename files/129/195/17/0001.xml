DoCTJMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 42COPY NO        q -2 May 1977 0 JCABINETGUARANTEED PRICE FOR MILKNote by the Secretary of Stat-3 for Foreign and commonwealth affairs..        The Ministerial Committee   on European Questions (CQM) failed toreached agreement on the guaranteed price for milk and I undertook to reportthe circumstances to Cabinet for decision.20 The guaranteed price of milk is a matter fcr national determinationoutside the scope of the annual price fixing arrangements of the common agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Community.3. The problem is to strike a balance between the needs of the dairyingindustry and the desire to restrain the rise in the retail price of milk.    TheGovernment&apos;s policy for agriculture set out in &quot;Food from our own Resources&quot;Cmnd. 6020 of April 1975 laid great emphasis on the expansion of thedairying industry and in particular on milk production in the interests of import saving.    It is a matter of judgment what guaranteed price to farmers will provide the degree of confidence and profitability in the industrynecessary to maintain and to increase production.    The Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food, taking account also of the effects on the retail price of milk and the requirements of agricultural policy initiallyinvited CQM to agree to a price of 48p per gallon but expressed a readiness to accept a price of 47p although this involved a possible risk to confidence.Against this it was argued that 45p should be sufficient to meet the situationgiven past experience of the way in which the size of the dairy herd hadreacted to former price changes.    It was pointed out that at 48p per gallonprofitability per cow would be greater than during the period from 1971 to 1972when considerable expansion of the dairy herd had occurred.4. The retail price of milk during the remainder of the year will beaffected by various factors including the decision to phase out food subsidies,but the guaranteed farm price is the only issue on which a decision is yet tobe taken.    The Committee discussed various options (these and othersprepared on the same basis are set out for the convenience of Cabinet at appendix A).    Particular attention was called to the options that if the guaranteed price were fixed at 48p per gallon the retail price would beincreased by 1-jrp a pint in June and a further lp in September, that at 47pthe increases would be 1-^p in July and lp in October and that at 46p it wouldbe possible to defer any increase beyond lp in June until late in Octoberwhen it would also amount to lp.    It was suggested that there was an1
additional option at the 45p level under which it would be possible to deferany increase until September when it would amount to 2p.    Attention wasalso called to that option at 46^p which would involve an increase of lp inJune and lp in September,,    In discussion of the various options theSecretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection suggested that, if,as he thought, the market for manufacturing milk proved weaker than theMinister of Agriculture expected the second retail price increases in eachcase could be required earlier than forecast.    It was noted that each lp on the retail price represents about 0. 2 per cent on the retail price index and0. 8 5 per cent on the food index.5. The Committee were very conscious of the advantage to pay policy of deferring as much as possible of the increase in the retail price of milkuntil after the Trades Union Congress (TUC) conference in September, aswell as of keeping retail price increases as small as possible.    Taking accountof these considerations, and of the views expressed about the effects ofvarious guaranteed price levels on the dairying industry, a large majorityfavoured fixing the guaranteed price at 46p per gallon, but the Minister ofAgriculture felt unable to agree to a guaranteed price which would be lp lower than the minimum which he thought essential to ensure the fulfilment of theGovernments agricultural policy by maintaining farmers&apos; confidence.RECOMMENDATION:cision6. The Cabinet is accordingly invited to endorse the majority decthat the guaranteed price of milk should be fixed at 46p, or to decide that itshould be set at 47p a gallon or at some intermediate point.    It would alasbe desirable to decide the timing and extent of the first retail price increaserelating to the guaranteed price chosen.D OForeign and Commonwealth Office2 May 19772CONFIDPIMTIAI
