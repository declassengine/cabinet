DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCPM)49 COPY NO     839 May 1977CABINET1977 UPRATING OF SOCIAL SECURITY benefits memorandum by the Central Policy Review StaffI. Long-term social security benefits must, by statute,  be upratedannually in line either with prices or earnings, whichever is the greater.Prices are rising faster than earnings, so that benefits will have to beuprated in line with the expected increases in prices between November 1976and November 1977.2. Prices are forecast to rise by 13.1 per cent over this period.    Touprate by this percentage would mean that long-term benefits would go upby  2 for the single person and  3.20 for a married couple.3. In CP(77) 45, the Secretary of State for Social Services and theMinister for Social Security propose an increase of 16 per cent, or  2. 50(single) and  4 (married).    In favour cf 16 per cent they argue:-a. Last year1 s price forecast was too low; if it is too low againthis year, the real value of benefits will fall - which would be politicallyunacceptable: a safety margin is needed.b.  2. 50 (single) and  4 (married) is exactly what the TradesUnion Congress (TUC) have suggested:  to accept their suggestion would help the social contract.4. In CP(77) 48, the Lord Privy Seal draws attention to complicationscreated by the increase in public service pensions, payable inDecember 1977:  the increase will be based on the June 1976-June 1977price increase, and is forecast to be of the order of 17-18 per cent.    Thiswould attract adverse comment, if compared with 13.1 per cent on benefitsgenerally - even though it is entirely explicable in terms of the differentperiod covered.5. In CP(77) 47, the Chief Secretary, Treasury argues for sticking tothe 13.1 per cent in the forecast, on the grounds that:-
a. Since the Government took office, p ensions have been increased by some 15 per cent in real terms, while real take-homepay has been falling;  with real earnings likely to fall again this year,there is no case for a further redistribution of income away fromthose in work now.b. Further narrowing of the differential between benefits and wages would be bad for incentives.c. The public expenditure constraints are too tight to allow it:there are already too many claims for comfort on the contingency reserve for both 1977-78 and 1978-79:  to add  125 million this yearand   310 million in the following year will make the problem ofexpenditure control still more difficult.recommendation. The Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) recommends that theCabinet endorse the Chief Secretary1 s proposals.    The public service pensionincreases are an awkward complication.    But they do not justify going beyond the 13.1 per cent which the Chief Secretary recommends.    13.1 per centmeets the statutory requirements.    If it turns out to be too low, there is always the opportunity of an interim uprating later.    In addition to thearguments in CP(77) 47 there are two further points which Ministers might consider:-a. What reason would the Government give for 16 per cent?If Ministers were to say they wanted to make a further increase inthe real value of benefits, they can be criticised both on general public expenditure grounds, and on the unfairness of worsening the differential between benefits and wages at a time when real earningshave fallen: if they say that they need a safety margin, they will be accused of planning on the assumption that they have no faith in theircounter-inflation policy.b. At best,  310 million more on social security must mean 3J0 million less for something else - whether industrial support,family support, or other services.    Moreover, if Ministers were toagree to the higher figure now, and found later on that the contingency reserve for 1978-79 was overspent, they could easily find themselveshaving to consider tax increases or expenditure cuts in 1978.    this could be very damaging.Cabinet Office9 May 1977
