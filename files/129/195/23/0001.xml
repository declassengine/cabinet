Document is the property of her britannic majesty-s government cp(77) 48 copy no       8 39 May 1977cabinetPUBLIC SERVICE PENSIONS INCREASE 1977Memcrandum by the Lord Privy seal. I have seen the papers by the Secretary of State for Social Servicesand the Minister for Social Security (CP(77) 45) and by the Chief Secretary,Treasury (CP(77) 47), on this year&apos;s uprating of social security benefits.By July-August we shall also need to have taken a decision on this year&apos;suprating of public service pensions under the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971.2. The public service pensions increase, which is based on the Juneyear-on-year rise in the Retail Price Index but which is not payable until1 December, seems likely on present forecasts to be nearly 18 per cent.    Ifit is decided that no more than 13.1 per cent can be awarded to State retire-ment pensioners, payable in November, the discrepancy between the twoincreases is bound to attract adverse criticism even though it is entirelyexplicable in terms of the different period covered.3. In each of the last two years we have decided not to restrict publicservice pensions increase despite strong and damaging public criticism which shows no sign of abating.    At the same time the difficulties of imposing restrictions have if anything increased since we last consideredthem in December in the context of the public expenditure cuts.     Primarylegislation would be entailed and very awkward problems of coverage and enforcement would arise if discrimination was to be avoided.    The attitudeof the public service unions is hardening and even to limit the increase to thatagreed for the State retirement pensioner would provoke strong opposition from unions such as the National and Local Government OfficersAssociation, the National Unicn of Teachers, the British medical association and the Police Federation in addition to the Civil Service unions.Any action to cover schemes in the wider public sector, so as to include the nationalised industries, would result in even more widespread and powerfulopposition.4. A list of the public services covered directly by, or by analogy with,the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971 is in the Annex, which also lists thosenationalised industries whose schemes are currently specifically linked tothat Act.1
5. The possibility of a public service pensions increase in excess of theincrease in the State retirement pension is a new factor with potential imp-lications for both.    My colleagues will wish to consider whether, despite thevery considerable difficulties, there is a case for restricting the publicservice increase to the same percentage as that for the State pension.    If soI will circulate as quickly as possible a detailed assessment of what would be involved.Civil Service Department9 May 19772rnwEincMTiAi
