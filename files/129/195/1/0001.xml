DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNICMAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 2611 March 1977 COPY NOCABINETSALE OF BP STOCKMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The attached note by my officials deals with the arrangements forselling part of the British Petroleum (BP) stock which is now in the handsof the Treasury and the Bank of England, following the decisions we took in cabinet on 7 December (CM(76) 38th Conclusions).    Other Departments havetaken part in the preparation of the note but are not committed by it.THE CASE FOR THE SALE2. First, we have already decided to sell BP stock, if necessary from theGovernment1 s own holding, and have announced it as part of the international monetary Fund (IMF) package.    It would be difficult to reverse this decision.We should have to explain to the IMF and others why we want to make a variation in the package, and this might well arouse suspicions that ourresolve to implement the package generally was weakening.    Second, we agreed on the sale because it was a relatively painless way of giving ourselvessome elbow-room in 1977-78.    That is still true.    It is of great importanceto the Budget strategy, and we lose nothing by the sale.    Third, we neverintended to acquire a 68 per cent stake in BP:  we acquired the ex-Burmahshares accidentally as part of the support operation.   We decided at an early stage not to use BP as an instrument of Government policy in the North Sea,and instead set up BNOC for this purpose.3. There is therefore no case for keeping more than 51 per cent of BPstock and there are powerful reasons for selling the remaining 17 per cent.The balance of arguments remain even if we accept, as I do, that we cannot now sell the ex-Burmah stock without courting unacceptable disadvantages.I cannot give up the  600 million or so which we shall receive from the saleof 17.4 per cent of the stock.    That is the equivalent, in full-year revenueterms, of around  800 million reduction in income tax.    (Even increasingHer Majesty&apos;s Governments holding to 51 per cent is not without cost because it means forgoing   20- 30 million of the maximum possible proceeds of sale. )   I conclude that we should sell 17.4 per cent of BP stock from theGovernments holding.
TIMING OF THE SALE4. It is important that we make a firm decision now, because only thencan I take full credit for the sale in the Budget arithmetic.    The precisetiming of the sale is less important, though it must take place in time forthe proceeds to be received in 1977-78.    If, as the Bank recommend, we agree to accept payment by instalments 6 months apart, to help maximisethe price we can get for such a large offer, we shall have to make the salebefore September.5. It has been suggested that the BP stock is under-valued at present,and that we should do better to wait until the price has peaked.    The aim ofall investors who want to sell is to do so at the peak:   the problem is todetermine in advance where the peak is.    There is always uncertainty.The price has been rising strongly in recent months, but the world tradeoutlook is not very promising, and any major accident on Forties or inAlaska could knock the share price considerably,    Moreover, a sale ofthis unprecedented size could only be made on a rising market if we are toget anything like the going price.    Bearing in mind all the risks anduncertainties, my firm view is that we should realise the proceeds from ourfortuitous investment as soon as possible and use them in the Budget to thebenefit of the economy generally.RIGHTS ISSUE6. BP have mentioned in the past that they may need to make a rightsissue in the near future to restore their debt/equity ratio, but the signs are that they have no plans for making such an issue within the next 18 months or so.    If they do mount a rights issue, it will inevitably present us witha difficult choice between finding a substantial sum to enable us to take up our rights, or diluting our holding.    It has been suggested that if we nowretained more than 51 per cent of the shares, we could accept somedilution following a rights issue and still maintain a holding in excess of51 per cent.    But this is an insurance policy with an unacceptably high cost.To cover the uncertain possibility of a rights issue and the doubtfuladvantages of a holding in excess of 51 per cent we should have to forgothe immediate and substantial benefits of a more expansionary Budget.HOLDING COMPANY7. Mr Len Murray has written to the Prime Minister suggesting thatthe necessary Budget effect could be achieved, whilst still retaining thestock in the public sector, by selling the stock to a  State-owned holding company.    Lord Balogh has also made a similar suggestion.    We have considered this carefully, but the money raised by any company in thepublic sector would count as part of the financing of the Public SectorBorrowing Requirement (PSBR);  it would not reduce it.    The only way wecan do that i6 by selling the stock outside the public sector.
RELATIONSHIP WITH BP8. The Attorney General may wish to comment further on his earlieradvice that Burmah1 s claim against the Bank of England is without merit.But colleagues will recognise that, even in the highly unlikely event that theBank lost the case and the public sector holding were reduced to a little over30 per cent, we should still have effective control over BP.    TheGovernments reserved rights are written into the Company1 s Articles of association.    These cannot be amended without a 75 per cent vote of thestockholders, so that any holding over 25 per cent protects Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s rights.ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE SALE9. There are a number of technical issues, referred to in the Note by officials, which colleagues will wish to consider in an appropriateMinisterial forum once we have reached agreement on the major issue.Some of these technical issues now need to be settled urgently if we are tokeep to the proposed timetable.RECOMMENDATIONS10.       I therefore invite my colleagues -a. to reaffirm the Governments intention to sell in 1977-7817.4 per cent of the BP stock now in public hands, so as to leave51 per cent available to the Government;b. to agree that we should not take the risk of prejudicing theBank&apos;s defence to the Burmah claim, and courting the financialdangers which could flow from that, by attempting to reach anagreement with Burmah which would enable us to sell from theBank&apos;s holding.    We should therefore proceed with the sale fromthe Government&apos;s holding;c. to agree that the more technical points concerning the methodof disposal etc. should be considered by the Ministers mostconcerned.D W treasury Chambers11 March 19773
SALE OF E? STOCKNote by Treasury OfficialsMinisters agreed on 17 November (EY(76) 19th Meeting) that it would bedesirable to obtain the relief to the PSBH which the proposed sale of the BPstock offered, if this could be done by selling part of the former Burmahholding in BP.   If, however, the proposal was to sell the stock already in the Government&apos;s -ownership, this might need consideration in Cabinet.   On7 December (CM(7&amp;) j8th Meeting) Cabinet decided that the Burmah Oil company should be pressed strongly not to persist in their, claim for restitution,but to substitute for it a financial claim which would have the effect of releasing the former Burmah stockholding for sale.   However, they agreedthat the Government should, if necessary, sell sufficient of their ownstockholding to reduce the total joint holding of the Government and the Bankof England to not less than 5&quot;^*Following the instructions from Cabinet, officials discussed with Burmahthe possibility of an arrangement to remove the blocking effect of their action against the Bank for the restitution of the stock.   While Burmah&apos;sinitital response was not entirely negative, the conditions they subsequentlysought to impose were unacceptable.   The Chancellor therefore announced inhis Statement on 15 December that, if the Government could not remove theimpediment to the sale of the Bank&apos;s stock, it would sell an   appropriateamount of its own stock, and in due course make good its holding by securingthe transfer to the Treasury of an equivalent amount of the BP stock acquiredfrom the Eurmah Oil Company and now held by the Bank of England.   following the announcement, officials have examined further, with the Treasury SolicitorTreasury Counsel and the Bank&apos;s lawyers, possible ways of removing the block.None of these appears really feasible, and even the least unpromising runsthe risk of seriously weakening the Bank&apos;s case and thus involves thepossibility of a loss to the Exchequer, when the financial settlement come tobe made, of the order of  500 million (ie the difference between the purchase price for the 20-2$ paid in January 1975 and the going market price for thewhole of that amount of stock).   Ministers will wish to consider whetherrisks of this kind and order should be run to avoid the presentationaldisadvantage of selling from the Government&apos;8 holding.
When Ministers last considered the question of a reference to theTakeover Panel, officials advised that there must be some risk, howeverslight, that the transfer of the Bank&apos;s shares to the Government might beblocked by the Panel (ENM(?6) 38).   Officials therefore recommended thatthe transfer of sufficient shares to replace those sold by the Governmentshould not be submitted to the Takeover Panel for approval, but that the subsequent transfer of the residual 2.8% which would increase the Govern-menfs holding to 51$ should bo so submitted.   This was agreed (ENM(76)9th Meeting, Item 2, as amplified by correspondence between the secretary of State for Trade and the Home Secretary).confidential.     In the light of the legal advice, officials recommend that theprospect of a sale of the Bank of England16 holding should be ab..and that Ministers should confirm their readiness to dispose of 17.&apos;$ ofBP stock from HMG&apos;s holding.   The Bank&apos;s holding would then be sold to theGovernment at the earliest possible date which would avoid prejudicingeither to the marketing operation or the legal proceedings.   This means that there   might be a period   while BKG&apos;s holding will be temporarilyreduced to a little over 30$ of &quot;BP stock, but it will be possible in themeantime to take steps to restore immediately on the sale the voting powerof the authorities&apos; holdings - both the Government&quot;s and the Bank&apos;s - whichthrough an undertaking to the Takeover Panel, has been restricted sincethe Bank acquired the stock.Disposal Plansh.     The proposed sale is, by a wide margin, the largest equity operationever mounted in any capital market, and the difficulties inherent in suchan operation should not be under-estimated.   The nature of the sellingarrangements must be determined by the objective of getting as high a priceas possible.    The Bank of England have, on this basis, prepared tentativeplans for the disposal which are described at Annex A, and Annex B sets outthe time-table which must be followed if the costs of the operation are tobe kept down end selling arrangements which might depress the price of thestock are to be avoided.   The Bank&apos;s preferred timing is for a sale in early Hay, because this will enable them to produce the necessary prospective-tus on the basis of the figures prepared by BP for their annual report &amp;accounts.Takeover Panel5.
6.   However, re-examination of the problem suggests the need for a change ofplan.   The repurchase by the Gbvernment of the Baulks holding will bring our owholding back to 5&quot;$ of BP stock, instead of the *r8.2&amp; of the last few years.The Panel rules require that any purchaser being a substantial holder of stock and seeking to increase the holding significantly is bound to make an offer for all the remaining stock unless granted exemption.   The Bank have nowadvised us strongly that the prospectuses for the sale should indicate theGovernment*s ultimate intentions with regard to the public sector holding.Moreover, since any uncertainty will inevitably affect the sale, and sincethe Government has already announced its intention of increasing its holdingto 51$, it would be.useful to dispel uncertainty about the Government&apos;intentions with regard to the Takeover Panel as soon as possible eg in the BPreport, which goes to the printers on 1? March.   An early approach to the Panelabout the whole transaction is therefore desirable.7.Though no soundings have been taken of the Panel, the Bank believe thatwith the support promised by BP, the Panel can bo persuaded to waive theirusual requirement, if given an assurance that the purchase would not signal antvfundamental change in the relationship between BUG, as majority stockholder, aithe Company.   We therefore recommend that if Ministers are prepared to give this assurance, they should formally seek the Panel&apos;s agreement to theincrease of 51$ as soon as possible;    tell them that the Government proposeto arrange for the early transfer to itself of the whole of the Bank&apos;sholdings, after the sale of 17.*$ of the stock from HMG&apos;s own holding;   and invite them to agree that the undertakings given by the Government and theBank, when the Burmah support operation was first set up, to waive certain of the voting rights in their BP stock should end from the date of the salefrom HMG&apos;s holding.   This represents a modification of the decisions taken inDecember.8.   If the Government are to succeed with the Takeover Panel, it will benecessary to reaffirm the existing relationship between BP and EMG as stock-holder by confirming that, notwithstanding HMG&apos;s declared intention toincrease its holding in the Company from the existing level up to 51^. it hasno intention of changing the relationship between the Company and HMG wherebyit does not intervene in the commercial affairs of BP.   This re-statementof the relationship reflects terms which have been used in financialprospectuses previously issued in the USA, and any change in the prospectusfor the forthcoming sale, whether explicit or implied by an omission,would inevitably prejudice the prospects for the sale.
Both in dealing with the Takeover Panel and in the subsequent salesprospectus, we will need to make cr acquiesce in statements about the relationship of BP with HMG, its major shareholder.   In the past, BP haveused in loan prospectuses etc in the USA, the phrase that &quot;the BritishGovernment has pledged not to interfere in the commercial affairs of BP,&quot;This could be held neither to accord well with the developing relationship with HMG as embodied in the North Sea participation agreements, nor fully to reflect past realities - eg the Bradhury/Bridges letters which define&apos;more precisely the circumstances in which HMG reserves the right to intervene.   On the other hand it is undoubtedly the formula which would mostreadily achieve a smooth selling operation (and in the view of the Bank ofEngland any change in the new prospectus, whether explicit or implied by omission, would inevitably prejudice the prospects for the sale).   Kinistwill need to decide which formulation they are prepared to accept.   the alternatives appear to be:a. the &apos;BP* formula   described above;b. a statement based upon the assurances given by the Chancellor to BPfollowing the Sunningdale agreement on participation to the effect tha&quot;the relationship has traditionally been maintained in a way which hasnot breached the practice of non-intervention in the administrationof the company as a commercial concern, and the government considersthat the /&quot;parti cipationjsrrailment is wholly compatible both withthis traditional relationship and with the underlying principles onwhich it is founded&quot;.   This assurance was given in the specificcontext of participation, and if repeated now would imply that thereacquisition of the shares would not in itself further alter the BP relationship.c. a more general formula designed to leave open the possibility ofa changed relationship.In choosing between these alternatives there are two    considerations which Ministers should bear in mind:i.   it would be unwise to give any p-abiic indication of a change in the relationship while BP is still awaiting SEC approval of its takeoverof Sohio;ii. &apos; the success of any approach to the Panel depends upon their agreement that the status quo is not seriously disturbed;
Treasury officials consider that only a or b are likely to prove acceptable to BP or to the Panel.Overs tas Purch as ea9.   The Foreign Office propose that we should dispose of the stock in a way&apos; which will secure maximum political credit, particu3.arly during the UKPresidency of the e.c..   A high proportion of the stock will undoubtedly bopurchased by foreigners on the London and New York capital markets.   There isno hard evidence at present of any interest on the part of e.c. governments in acquiring part of the stock direct, though feelers were put out by the GenGovernment in 1975* though since withdrawn, and could be repeated asdisposal becomes imminent.   Interest in other European capitals is also likelyto revive if BP publishes good results in April and if its Annual Report isconsidered promising.   There may however be some doubt whether an offer on conditions acceptable to HMG would be attractive to foreign governments.It would be necessary to explain to them that RMG was offering only aportfolio investment, without any influence over the Company or any impliedaccess to oil.10.   Even if foreign governments were likely to be interested in such a port-folio investment, we are in no position to offer it to them on preferentialterms.   We have considered three courses.   First, we could reserve a block of stock for direct placement in the e.c..   It would be difficult to do this with-out stating a price in advance, and this cannot be done until the terms havebeen decided.   To preserve flexibility this has to be left to the last possible moment.   The Bank advise that a placement of this kind would undulycomplicate the main marketing operation and must be ruled out.   Second, wegivecould/them advance notice of the sale and indicate that they may like to bidon the opan market.   But since we cannot give them price-sensitive data (acategory which includes the date of the sale) while the markets are open, thiswould tell them very little that they do not already know.   It would bepossible to convey such information after the markets closed on the workingday preceding the sale, but this would give Governments no real advantagesince they   could hardly decide overnight on their bid.   However, it could be presented as a co-operative and friandly gesture.   Thirdly, we could drawgovernments&apos;, attention to the sale - perhaps a Ministerial message -simultaneously v/ith the announcement, making it clear (a3 in the second
option) that &quot;they or their parastatal agencies were free to bid.While there are no marketing objections to this course,  it seemsto have relatively few political attractions.   Ministers will wishto consider which if any of these courses is worth pursuing.11.   As a &quot;European&quot; gesture, a subsidiary marketing operation inFrankfurt could have distinct cosmetic advantages, but only if itwere successful.    We have received conflicting advice on the likelihood of a successful operation,  and if Ministers find theidea of a small issue in Frankfurt attractive we should need totake more systematic advice.Alternative Disposal Flans12.   We have looked very carefully at the many suggestions forspecial selling arrangements which have come from various quarters.It has been argued that certain proposals (such as a. first optionfor specified classes of investors,  eg trade unions pension funds,or direct sales across Post Office counters to members of theBritish public) might have the advantage of raising public interesland thereby selling stock that would not otherwise be sold.    Infact the sale will be very widely advertised in the Press, and available to subscribers using the normal postal services, and sothere would be little advantage to be gained by special arrangements.    On the contrary,  they would have the majordisadvantage of complicating the marketing operation, and official;judge that this is in itself such a complex and difficult task tha-its success should not be put unnecessarily at risk.Size.. of the Operation13.   When Cabinet last considered the proposal to sell some of theBP stock now held by the authorities,  a long-term holding of 51$implied a contribution of some  500 million towards reducing thePSBR.     But the -price of BP stock has since improved, leavingMinisters with the alternatives of selling sufficient stoch toleave the public sector holding at 51$,  as the Chancellorannounced on 15 December;    or sufficient stock to raise  500million (leaving the public sector holding at around 54$);    or some figure in between, bearing in mind that each 0.1$ of stocksold would increase the receipts by about  3i? million at presentmarket prices.   There is no advantage of substance in keeping a
further 3$ of the stock, and little presentational advantage given that the Chancellor has already announced that the future holdingwill be 51$.     On the contrary a decision to retain more than 51$might well have an adverse effect on the market, and might be criticised on the grounds that the Government was subordinatingthe need to get maximum room for manoeuvre in handling the economy to the insubstantial attractions of holding 3$ more of BP stock.Any addition to the holding over 51&apos;/ would of course imply a prorata increase in the liability to provide funds for any futurerights issues.     Officials therefore recommend that sufficientstock should be sold to leave the public sector holding at 51$.
STRUCTURE OF THE MAIN MARKETING 0PERAT3ION1.     The selling operation will be, by a wide margin, the largestequity offering ever made in world markets.    The Bank have consideredthe possibility of dividing it up into a number of separate offeringsin a variety of centres, but strongly advise against this because ofthe adverse effect that the overhang of further offerings still tocome would have on all the operations except the last.    The Bankaccordingly propose a single offering with two main elements, or.ecentred in London and the other in New York with the London issuegoverning the timetable for the whole.    It is possible,, and indeedprobable, that it would be desirable to add subsidiary issues in othermarkets, particularly Germany and Canada, but these could without difficulty be tacked onto the main London/New York operation once themain lines of this have been settled.    There are indications that itwould be possible to sell large amounts (something between  100m and 200m in total in cash terms) to a.number of wealthy individualinvestors in the Middle East.    It would seem doubtful, however, whetherit would be wise to make this an aim of the operation.    If suchinvestors are minded to buy, they vail be able to pursue the objectivewithout difficulty through the London issue, and there would bedisadvantages in encouraging a concentration of BP stock is such a.narrow geographical area and in the relatively few hands that wouldbe involved.2,     There are strong arguments for using the New York Market.    If theoffer were limited to the London Market, it would impose a strain whichwould, be reflected in a lower sale price.    The capacity of the New YorkMarket is large and it serves a much greater part of the world than the
(m%m-USA alone.   BP&apos;s.development in Alaska and its connection with theSohio Company in the USA makes its stock arguably a very goodcandidate for inclusion in major investment psrt!:olios in the USA, yetit is reported that this stock is at present only held by a few - thereare identifiable only 35 holdings by major institutional investorsagainst over 600 in Exxon and over 300 in the case of other US majoroil companies.   If BP is to continue its world-wide development it willhave a continuing need for access to funds.   There would be advantage if opportunity of the present operation were taken to relieve the UK ofsome of the weight of this fund-raising.   The capacity of the New Yorkmarket is likely to be in a range from about $250 million, or 16-17million stock units, to S^OO-SJOO million which would cover, say,30 million stock units.3.   Established issuing practice differs appreciably as between theLondon and the New York markets, and to tie them together bothefficiently and to the advantage of the seller raises a wide range of technical problems which are being explored.   To gain maximum acceptancein the New York market, the offering would need to be mountedalong sti ctly traditional lines.   This would involve assembling a group of 5 or 6 leading investment banks having a good geographical spreadacross the country to secure the maximum impact.   The operation should no doubt -be aimed primarily at institutional investors, but theindividual investor is also a significant force in the New York market and should not be ignored.   The issuing houses&quot;would be chosen with that consideration in mind so as to cover both types of buyer.Associating a Canadian issuing house with the group would increase the
CONFIDENTIAL *Liajj Annex Aabsorbtive capacity to a useful degree (perhaps as much as        million).The selling expenses involved would be heavy, but these are an inesca-pable feature of such an operation in North American.markets and itis expected that the higher overall price would more than offset theadditional costs.    The issue in the USA would, under Securities and exchange Commission rules, have to be in fully-paid form, and so thefull proceeds would be received in a single instalment.    A fullprospectus would be required, and the data,  for this will have to comefrom BP.k.     Similarly, in the UK our present advice is that a traditionalapproach is recommended.    This would involve assembling a large group of issuing houses and brokers who would, for a commission, guarantee the subscription of the issue and then go out and place sub-underwritingcommitments with the investing institutions.    This was the patternadopted, for example, in 1961 on the denationalisation of the Ironand Steel Industry for the sale of the prior charge securities of thecompanies concerned to a value of some  85 million, the offering beinghandled by a consortium of eight houses.    Though the costs would bewell below US standards, they would nevertheless be substantial andto ensure success the issue would no doubt have to be made at somediscount on the market price ruling just prior to the operation.    Thepossibilities of reducing the cost of the operation are being explored.
confidential annex: bmmTIMETABLEThe assumptions are;(a) that the objective is tin 1977-78;o secure the proceeds of the sal(b)     that the arrangements should be such as to maximise theprice and to minimise the costs.This points to a sale linked to the publication in April of BP&apos;s annual report and accounts (so that  the expense of preparing fresh financialborne by HMG,as seller, is avoided)information for the prospectus, which would have to be   /   and to asale early in the year so that the strain on the markets can bereduced, and the adverse effect on price minimised, by arranging for payments in     instalments in 1977-78.    For example, the price of units sold in the UK market could be made payable in two instalments,the first (perhaps ^0%) on the day the lists open and the balancesix months later - the widest gap the tax rules allow.2.     On the furtherassumption that there is to bo an early approach to the Takeover Panel, a timetable which would fit the above frameworkwould be as follows.Early March17 March1 April28 April2 May5 May13 May16 MayApproach to PanelPreliminary announcement of 1976 results,BP report and accounts to printersBP report and accounts publishedBP&apos;s AGMAnnounce issuePay final dividend, andAdvertise prospectusApplication lists open and closeAnnounce result
Annex B3-     It would be possible to postpone the operation if market conditions proved unfavourable - although there would be progressivelyincreasing costs attached to such a delay.    It would not, on the otherhand, be possible to bring the sale date forward.
