Document is the property of her britannic majesty1 s government cp(77)31 copy no S214 March 1977cabinetDIRECT ELECTIONS TO THE EUROPEAN ASSEMBLYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. At Cabinet on 25 February (CM(77) 8th Conclusions) I was invited, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs, to circulate a new draft of the White Paper on Direct Elections.2. A new draft is attached.    The layout of the White Paper and the content of the earlier paragraphs have been substantially changed, primarily in order to emphasise the constitutional issues.    In addition to referring to alist system and a compulsory dual mandate which was discussed by Cabinet,the draft also deals with the single transferable vote, since this is a majoroption which I believe Parliament and the public will expect to see covered in a White Paper which is intended to have &quot;green edges&quot;.    The question offinance is touched on only briefly in paragraph 39 of the draft:  this isclearly a matter to which my colleagues will wish to give serious consideration.3* The White Paper would have four annexes:Annex A (Electoral Systems in the other Member States) circulated on 21 February as Annex A to CP(77) 20.Annex B (List System) is being circulated by the Cabinet Office.Annex C (Single Transferable Vote) is attached.Annex D (Compulsory Dual Mandate) circulated on 11 March asCP(77) 27.These texts have been prepared by officials.    On certain points there is a difference of emphasis between the draft White Paper and the proposedannexes.    Some harmonisation will be needed before publication.1
4. Paragraphs 22 and 22a set out the two alternatives:  whether weshould decide now to adopt a particular electoral system, or whether weshould reach no conclusion until the White Paper has been debated. Mystrong preference is for the latter course.M RHome Office14 March 19772

DRAFT of 14 March 1977WHITE PAPER ON DIRECT EMOTIONS TOTHE EUROPEAN assembly the BACKGROUND-    The United Kingdom became a member of the European community in 1973 and our membership was endorsed by the referendum of 1975-This fundamental decision has implications for the relationship between our form of government and the institutions of theCommunity.2.     The European&quot;Community was established in 1958 by the cominginto force of the Treaty of Rome.   Article 138(3) of the TreatyProvides for the introduction of a system of elections to theEuropean Assembly on the basis of &quot;direct universal suffrage inaccordance with a uniform procedure for all member States&quot;.    Howeverfor the past 19 years, members of the European Assembly have been nominated by national Parliaments from among their members inaccordance with Article 138(1).5.     The European Assembly is very different from the Westminsterparliament since it has no independent legislative functions and agovernment is not formed from its members.   As Article 137 of theT*treaty of Rome explains, it has only &quot;advisory and supervisoryPowers&quot;.    However, it does have certain limited powers in relationto the Community budget and it has the power to dismiss the wholeof the European Commission.    The present nominated Assembly consists of 198 members of which 36 represent the United Kingdom when it is directly elected, the Assembly will have 410 members, 81 of them from the United Kingdom.CONFIDENTIAL
4.     Direct elections have increasingly heen seen as animportant means of strengthening democratic participation in Community affairs.   A Green Paper on direct elections to the European Assembly (Cmnd. 6399) was presented toParliament in February 1976*5.     Agreement was reached between all member States on20 September 1976 on the text of a Council Decision on direct elections (published as Cmnd. 6623).    This Agreementlays down that, subject to its provisions, the electoral procedures for these first direct electionsshould be governed by the national provisions of each member State.. The substantive provisions of the agreement will not come into force until all member States have completed their respective constitutional requirements.The preamble to the Decision records the agreed intentionQl member States that the first direct elections to theEuropean Assembly should be held in the period May/Junex9?8.    In recognition, however, of the possibility thatsome member States might have difficulty in completing the necessary legislative and other preparatory stagesir* that bimescale, no binding date for first electionsWas set.    The Agreement provides for the Council, acting^animously after consulting the Assembly, to determine the date of the first elections at a later stage.    HerKadesty&apos;s Government has undertaken to use its best endeavours to be ready for elections by May/June 1978 and The Queen&apos;ssPeech of November 1976 contained a commitment to introduceCONFIDENTIAL
&quot;the necessary legislation in the current Session ofParliament.6.     There are fundamental constitutional issues involvedin direct elections to the European Assembly.    It is theview of the Government that before legislation is introductedthere should be a Parliamentary debate in which all aspects of&quot;the matter are considered.    The purpose of this White Paper is tPut the issues involved before the Parliament and the people of&quot;the United Kingdom.
- 4 - .part i:  tee constitutional issuesTHE electoral system7.      The electoral system to be used for direct elections to theEuropean Assembly presents a most difficult issue.    The uk hasa distinctive electoral system which has developed graduallyover the last one and a half centuries and which is different from that of any other e.c. Member State,    ft has stood the test oftime and it is well understood by the electorate at large and bythe political Parties.8-       With certain limited exceptions, all local and nationalelections in the UK have always been on the basis of the first-Past-the-post electoral system.   The concept of the constituency^ a fundamental part of our traditional electoral practice and at both local and national level each person elected has owed aspecial allegiance to a distinct and comparatively small electorate.this local power base has not been without significance in theHouse of Commons itself where the individual Member of Parliamentoften plays a distinctive part in influencing the policies of theGovernment and his Party.   The advantage of the single memberconstituency is that the elector votes for a particular candidatein the clear knowledge that the candidate who obtains most votesWill be elected and will act as his particular Member.9&apos;      Furthermore, the careful and objective drawing of constituency boundaries by a statutory Boundaries Commission, independent of theGovernment of the day, together with the right of electors to challenge proposed boundaries and
with the necessity for subsequent approval by Parliament,has become an essential part of our democratic process.10.   All these traditional practices are basic to the westminster-type Parliamentary democracy.    They should notbe changed or curtailed for direct elections to the european assembly except after the most careful consideration ofthe present and future implications.U.    In this respect, there is no doubt that the party organisations which have grown alongside the developmentof our democratic institutions have reflected the natureof these institutions.    Party organisations are significantand there have developed the structures of constituency,regional, and national Party organisation and conferences.Within the Party system, the selection of candidates tends to be^-centralized and exercised by the local constituency.Whatever form of electoral practice emerges, Partyorganisation and selection of candidates will both beaffected by a move to direct elections to the european assembly.12.   Our partners in the E.E.C, with their different historicaltraditions, have developed different electoral systems.Host of them use some form of proportional representation&quot;or national elections and, for elections to the european assembly, it seems likely that, apart from the Republicuf Ireland (where it is proposed to use the single transferableVQto system of election), all other member States will use    -some form of list system.    (Details of the systems used or expected to be used by the other members of the E.E.C. are givenin Annex A.)   Thus, if we use our traditional first-past-the-post electoral system for
CONFIDENTIALtothe first direct elections to the European Assembly, therewill be significant differences between our procedure andthat of the other 8 countries who will be electing members to the same Assembly.13.   There are other difficulties which result from someof the inherent characteristics of the existing Britishsystem.    One of these characteristics is the tendency forswings in electoral opinion to be magnified in terms of seats won or lost.    This has been regarded by many as an advantage in the context of Westminster elections wherea Government is being elected.    In the context of Europeanelections, however, this might be regarded as a less desirablefeature.    This would be especially so if, as some studieshave suggested, the relatively small number of Assemblyconstituencies (81 as compared to 635 Westminsterconstituencies) further magnified this effect with afinal result in terms of seats which was quite disproportionateto votes cast.    There is the further point that, particularly ifAssembly elections fell mid-way between General.Elections to westminster, there could be a wide divergence between thebalance of power at Westminster and the Party composition of the United Kingdom members of the European Assembly.    In one resject,given the advisory nature of the European Assembly, thismieht not be a matter of much concern, but in a developingsituation, it could lead to friction between the government at Westminster and the U.K. representatives in the directly elected^european Assembly or even the Assembly itself.]A-   It would be possible to overcome, or at least mitigate,some of these difficulties by adopting a system of
aCONFIDENTIALfproportional representation for elections to the european assembly.    Since the European Assembly does not constitute a legislature or provide a government, and since its membersdo not have the same constituency responsibilities as aWestminster M.P, proportional representation for theEuropean Assembly might not be open to the same objectionsas proportional representation for the Westminster Parliament.A different institution might warrant a different form of election.15.   A list system could be devised based on the wholeof the United Kingdom or Great Britain; or on separatelists for their constituent parts; or England could be sub-dividedinto regions or constituencies, each region being allocated a numberof members on the basis of electorate (Annex B shows how suchsystem might work in practice).    The adoption of a listsystem would bring us into line with the majority of our european partners and would ensure that the allocation of seats was more proportional to the votes cast for theCOfapeting Parties,    It would also have advantages in the speed with which it could be brought into operation, sinceelaborate Boundary Commission procedures would not benecessary to define individual constituencies.    There would .simply be say 11 regions instead of 81 new constituencies.l6-   Nevertheless, to abandon our traditional method inthis Way would be a major constitutional innovation, theconsequences cf which are difficult to foresee.    It wouldan the absence of the sort of constituency link with which ..are familiar and would necessitate changes in PartySanisations, including giving the central or regionalme
CONFIDENTIALegParty machine a key role in nominating candidates.    the electorate might take time to become accustomed to the new system and might be confused by the existence of separateprocedures for national and European elections, althoughthe Northern Ireland electorate have coped with such a situation since 1973-    Furthermore, there might have to beyet another change if, in due course, in accordance withthe Treaty of Rome, there is a move to put European electionson a common basis and a different system were then adopted.This would be a matter for all Community governments andtheir respective Parliaments.]-7.   Besides the first-past-the-post and list systems,a third possible electoral system is the single transferable -vote, which is another form of proportional representation.Tt has already been used for local government Convention and assembly elections in Northern Ireland.    Such a system involvesfculti-member constituencies and the elector votes for as manycandidates as he wishes in order of preference.    This systemSives maximum influence to the elector who is able to express a preference between the different candidates of the Party of hischoice as well as between the candidates of other Parties (see Anfor further details of this system).    Such a system would ret;the concept of the constituency, but geographicallySuch constituencies would be larger than single memberEuropean constituencies in a first-past-the-post system ofSection and much larger than the Westminsterconstituencies used in our General Elections.    The 81Seats might be allocated to   12 constituencies each having a Membership between 3 and 10.;am
3KRDENTIAI18.       However, STY like the list system would involve fundamentaldepartures from our usual electoral practice and, would againmean that we were using different electoral systems for national and European elections.   STV would probably require some kind of boundary procedure, which would be simpler (but might not be quicker) than that necessary if we were to use the irst-past-the-post system.19.       If either a list system or STV were used, it would be important to ensure a democratic procedure for the selection of candidates and if possible to involve the Westminster constituenciesln this procedure.COMPULSORY DUAL MANDATE20.      Another problem is the relationship between Assembly members**d Westminster MPs.   Assembly members who were not also membersQf the Westminster Parliament would tend to be out of touch with developments at Westminster and might regard themselves as owinga Primary allegiance to European rather than national Parties.2i-       Such problems could be overcome if all Assembly members have to be MPs - the compulsory dual mandate (see Annex D).    this connection^ld be combined with a requirement that elections of UK members to the European Assembly should coincide with our General Elections.But the compulsory dual mandate would in turn create serious5l,acticai difficulties.   The strain of performing the double taskv&apos;0^ld be very great the work of Parliament would be hindered bytlle absence of
81 IlPs at the European Assembly.    To make the date ofnational and European elections coincide would mean renegotiationof the Council Decision of September 1976 (unless we were preparedto have fixed term Parliaments at Westminster).    In addition it wouldhe necessary to provide for the situation where an Assemblymember subsequently lost his Westminster seat.    Of course,currently Assembly members are also members of their nationallegislature but, following direct elections, the dual mandateconcept would be much more difficult to operate.    Now theU-K. sends 36 delegates, some of whom come from the Houseof Lords, bub after direct elections, we shall send 81^embers,all of whom would have to come from the Houseof Commons under a compulsory dual mandate system.    Purther-^ore, when the European Assembly is directly elected andthe overwhelming majority of its members do not sit ina national legislature, the Assembly is liable to have amore intensive scheme of business which pays little regardto the times of sittings of the various national legislatures.opTlONS22*   Zlt is clear that the U.K. faces a number of difficult problems in its approach to direct elections, some of whichare not shared by our E.E.C. partners.    The Government isav&apos;are of the important constitutional issues involved.is also conscious of the undesirability of making^Cor constitutional changes unless they have a wide measure of
support.   After very careful consideration, the Government hascome to the conclusion that, for the first elections to theEuropean Assembly, /the first-past-the-post system/ /&amp; regionallist system/ /STV/ /&amp; compulsory dual mandate system withAssembly elections coninciding with national general elections/would be best suited to the needs of the situation in Great Britain^or22A.   As the preceding paragraphs show, it is clear that thettK fares a number of difficult problems in its approach to direct electW, some of which are not shared by our EECPartners.    The Government is aware of the important constitutional issues involved.    It is also conscious of the undesirability of taking major constitutional changes unless they have a wide measure of support.    There appear to be four main possibilities:to stick to our traditional first-pasu-the-post electoral system;to change to a list system of proportional representation probably0n a regional basis; to change to STV; or to retain the first-past-^e-post system as far as possible but to combine this with theCoapulsory dual mandate and to make the Assembly elections coincidev;i&quot;bh national general elections.   Each of these possibilities hasSOl*e attractions; but each also presents serious difficulties.Before coming to a conclusion on this, the Government wishes to listen to the views expressed in Parliament elsewhere.
CONFIDENTIALPART II:    RESPONSE TO THE SELECT COMMITTEE(1)    SIMPLE MAJORITY SYSTEM23.    The Select Committee on Direct Elections to theEuropean Assembly recommended that the first electionsbe conducted on our normal first-past-the-post electoralsystem.    If this is to be the basis of these elections,then the Government will wish to see the following arrangments on the particular procedural points on which theSelect Committee has made recommendations in its second and Third Reports.
ftAllocation of Seats24.    It will be necessary to decide upon the allocation of our 81seats among the component parts of the United Kingdom.    It wouldbe possible to base the allocation of seats directly in accordancewith the size of the electorate in each of the component partsor in accordance with current representation at Westminster, orin other ways.    For the first elections, bearing in mind,among other things, the special circumstances of Northern Ireland,&quot;the Government proposes accepting the Select Committee&apos;recommendation on the allocation of seats.    This would giveEngland 66 seats, Scotland 8, Wales 4 and Northern Ireland 3-   for subsequent elections, the allocation of seats and the determination of boundaries (which is dealt with below) could be referred tothe Speaker&apos;s Conference on Electoral Law.Determination of Constituencies25.    The Government would agree with the Select Committee&apos;srecommendations that the European Assembly constituencies shouldDe formed by grouping existing Parliamentary constituencies andtnat the number of electors in each of the European Assemblyconstituencies should be approximately equal (with some exceptionsfor geographical reasons).    Northern Ireland would, however,form a single European constituency.   The Government considers thattlle special circumstances of Northern Ireland would make itaPpropriate for direct elections there to be conducted by a system of proportional representation.
;er26.     The procedures for the determination of Westminst(constituencies are laid down in the House of Commons (redistribution of Seats) Acts 1949 and 1958.   These procedures make provision forrepresentations to be made to the Boundary Commissions about theirProvisional recommendations and for local inquiries to be held; ifnecessary, two rounds of representations and local inquiries may takePlace.27.     The Select Committee have recommended that the European Assemblyconstituencies should be determined on the basis of recommendationsfrom the Parliamentary Boundary Commissions, using as far as possiblesimilar procedures to those employed by the Commission in the reviewsQf Parliamentary constituency boundaries.   The Select CommitteeRelieved that some curtailment of these full procedures would beaccessary for elections to be held in May/June 1973 and recommendedthat the existing procedures should be followed, but with provision&quot;or one round only of local representations and inquiries.   The Commentsimilarly takes the view that it is very desirable for thefilamentary Boundary Commissions to be asked to make recommendations011 the determination of the boundaries for European AssemblyCQnstituencies.   Por subsequent elections, it would seem appropriate0r the full Parliamentary constituency review procedures to beAllowed, but it would not be possible for the Commission to followthese procedures for the. first elections if these are to be heldln May/june 1978.28*      In the Government&apos;s view a choice would have to be made betweenthe following three options for the first elections:A.    Boundary Commission recommendations following one round of representations and local inquiries, or0cf
CONFIDENTIALifB.   Boundary Commission recommendations following one round of representations but no local inquiries, orG.   Boundary Commission recommendations with no representationsor local inquiries.In evidence to the Select Committee, the Boundary Commissionssuggested that from the time of Royal Assent to the relevant legislati.^ to the submission of their reports, Option A would take a minimumQI 30 weeks, Option B a minimum of 13 weeks and Option C a minimum of9 weeks.   Bearing in mind that some 6 months will be needed to selectcandidates and prepare for the elections, the Boundary CommissionswiU need to complete their work by the end of 1977 if elections areto be held in Hay/June 1978.29-     The Government considers that it would be unsatisfactory for^ere to be no provision for either representations or local inquiriestherefore finds Option C unattractive.    On the other hand, thereis insufficient time to be at all sure of implementing Option A.With SOffie reluctance, the Government therefore inclines in favour of^tion B for the first elections, since&quot;this would .at least provideS0*e opportunity lor the political parties and other interested bodies to express a view on the Commissions&apos; provisional recommendations,c&quot;ranchise30-     The Government agrees with the Select Committee that the franchise for European Assembly elections should in general be theSaa* as for United Kingdom Parliamentary elections with the additon0X Peers.   The Committee recommended that the franchise should be^tended to certain United Kingdom nationals
Noresident overseas; but the Government does not consider that this important extension, which woi-d have obvious relevance to the franchise for Westminster, should be made without prior considerationDy a Speaker&apos;s Conference.Disqualification31.       The Government proposes accepting the Select Committee&apos;recommendation on disqualification.   This would mean that the rules governing disqualification of candidates for Westminster electionswould be applied with the modification that peers and all clergymenwould be allowed to stand for election to the European Assembly,^en if there were no compulsory dual mandate/   Members of the westminster Parliament would not be disqualified from election to theEuropean Assembly.Conduct of Elections32The Government accepts the Select Committee&apos;s recommendationtaat in general normal United Kingdom Parliamentary electoral lawsnould apply to the conduct of European Assembly elections.    This would0ver the present arrangements for absent voting by post or proxyand +-Uone arrangements for service voting.^Posits33The Select Committee recommended that the deposit should beset a-f-  P! r-^ ,150 for each Parliamentary constituency contained in theroPean Assembly constituency.   The Government takes the view - that itv,0Uld -hoe preferable for a fixed and rather lower deposit to be setand n-pproposes the sum of  500 irrespective of the size of the Assembly   -nstituency concerned.   A deposit of this size would deter frivolous^Micw^oures without unreasonably inhibiting genuine candidates.
Nominations34.       The Select Committee recommended that nominations should heaccompanied by the signatures of ten per Westminster constituencyof those eligible to vote in the European Assembly constituency.   TheGovernment considers that the number of nominations required for european Assembly elections should be greater than that requiredfor a Westminster election, but does not consider that the increase should be in proportion.   The Government therefore proposes that,if the first-past-the-post system is adopted, nominations should be accompanied by the signature of a fixed number of electors in eachEuropean Assembly constituency and proposes that this number should set at about 50.beReturning Officers55.       The Select Committee recommended that in England and Wales the^turning officer should be appointed by the Chief Executive for thecounty (including metropolitan counties and the Greater London council which the European Assembly constituency (or the larger part of it)^ situated,    In Scotland, they recommended that the returning officers*ould be appointed by the Secretary of State from among thosePointed to act as returning officers at regional or Island councilSections.    In Northern Ireland, they recommended that the returning officer should be the Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland.*he Government accepts the recommendations in relation to ScotlandNorthern Ireland, but considers that it would be more appropriate in England and Wales for the Secretary of State to appoint the^urning officers from among the returning officers for the relevantfilamentary constituencies (the sheriff of the country or the**** of the borough or the chairman of the district council).    TheyW0*ld be required to delegate most of their duties to an actingburning officer.        ^ i-r-a A iCONFSDENT5AL
CONFIDENT!/Election Expenses Limits36.       The Government proposes, as recommeded by the Select Committee,to consult the political parties on an appropriate formula for limiting candidates&apos; election expenses.    The Government would proposethat there should be a free   postal delivery of candidates&apos; electionaddresses on the same basis as for Parliamentary elections.%-Elect ions37.     The Select Committee recommended that the machinery for fillingAssembly vacancies should be set in motion by means of a writ moved in the House of Commons.   The Government does not consider thatthis procedure would be entirely appropriate, since members of theAssembly may not be members of the House of Commons.   The Governmentaccepts that arrangements will need to be made to ensure that there^ no clash between Westminster and European Assembly by-elections andis at present considering how best to deal with this.Broadcasting3B-     The Select Committee pointed out that broadcasting raisesspecial problems in relation to direct elections.    The Governmentaccepts the Select Committee&apos;s recommendation that the full^Plications of this should be examined through the existing machinery for the provision of part political broadcasts.finance39*     The Government considers that the cost of administering-Eui,european Assembly elections should be met out of theGorisolidated Fund.   The Government has not yet formed a view on
CONFIDENTIALftwhether candidates should receive any reimbursement of theirexpenses from central funds.   This matter is being considered in the context of the Governments consideration of therecommendations made by the Committee on Financial Aid to political Parties (Cmnd 6601).Other Matters40.     There are other matters (such as the arrangements for electoral registration and for the avoidance of double voting, the countingQ  votes and the declaration&apos; of results) that will need to be covered.   The Government agreees with the Select Committee thatthese matters should be conducted in accordance with normalParliamentary electoral law and practice.    It will, however, benecessary to make certain adaptations to fit the circumstances of-^ropean Assembly elections.
PART (2); LIST c-YSTEM41.       If the electoral system used in the first directelections were a regional list system of the kind outlined in Annex B rather than the first-past-the-post system, then theGovernment would have to make a different response to some ofthe procedural recommendations of the Select Committee.^2.      Tne Bill could specify the regions to be adopted and thenumber of seats to be allocated to each region.   These regionsmight be the economic planning regions which are well known.Alternatively, some form of Boundary Commission procedure mightDe desirable, especially if such recognised regions were to be.sub-divided.^3.       It may be that a regional list system would call for adifferent view on the appropriate value of the deposit and     numberQi nominations and on the appointment of Returning Officers.If the list- system were used, it would probably be unnecessary toUoLi by-elections.CO N  ? n F NTIA
part (3):   single transferable voteIf the electoral system used in the first directelections were a single transferable vote system of the kindoutlined in Annex C rather than the first-past-the-post system,then the Government would have to make a different response to someQf the procedural recommendations of the Select Committee.^5.        As with the list system, the Bill could specify the constituencies to be adopted and the number of seats to be allocated to each constituency.   These constituencies might bebased on well established regions such as the economic planningregions.   Alternatively, some form of Boundary CommissionProcedure might be desirable, especially if such recognised regiwere to be sub-divided to make STV constituencies.ons
THE SINGLE TRANSFERABLE VOTE (STV)1&apos; The single transferable vote (STY) system of proportional representationinvolves the use of multi-member constituencies.    In this system, account is taken not only of the voter&apos;s first choice of a candidate but also ofhis second and subsequent preferences.   The voter marks on his ballot paperhis order of preference (1, 2, 3, etc) for all the candidates named on the ballot paper.    By doing so, he is indicating where his support should goif -either the candidate of his first choice has already secured enoughvotes for election,or his first choice is eliminated because he has secured too fewvotes to stand any chance of election.2- The STV system is used in the Republic of Ireland, Australia (elections tothe Senate) and in local elections in Northern Ireland.   Such matters as the exact means of calculating the electoral quota and the procedure forredistributing surplus and other votes may vary according to the precisesystem selected.   Constituencies always return at least three members.3. For European Assembly elections, Wales, Northern Ireland and probably Scotlandcould each constitute a single constituency.    In England, the constituenciescould be formed on a regional basis (although some modifications wouldprobably have to be made to the South East economic planning region, whoseelectorate would entitle it to about 24 members).^* The following is a much simplified   description of the main stages of an election using the single transferable vote system of proportional representation.   It is based on the system used in Northern Ireland.5- Thvoter marks the names of the candidates in his order of preference(i^e. 1, 2, 3, etc, for as many names as he wishes,    up to the limit of the
PUNHDENTIALnumber of names appearing on the ballot paper).Q- The returning officer determines the number of valid first preference votescast for each candidate.first,7* An electoral quota is established byy/dividing the number of valid ballot papers by the number of members to be elected plus one. One is then added toproduce the quota.Anyone whose total of valid first preference votes exceeds the quota isdeclared elected.^*   If vacancies remain, the number of votes by which an elected candidate has exceeded the quota is transferred to the candidates who have not yet been declared elected.    The transfer is made in accordance with the second or(if the candidate of the voter&apos;s next choice has already exceeded the quota)subsequent preferences shown on the ballot papers.    For this purpose all the ballot papers cast for a successful candidate are examined in order todetermine the proportions in which his surplus votes should be transferredto the as yet unelected candidates.If a transfer of surplus votes brings the total of votes cast for othercandidates above the electoral quota, they in turn are declared elected.Their surplus votes are then, if vacancies remain, transferred to the remain-ing candidates.    The transfer is made according to the proportion of nextpreferences.shown by the transferred ballot papers which brought them up toor over the quota (i.e. the candidates&apos; original first preference votes arenot taken into account).If, after all surpluses of successful candidates have been transferred thereremain vacancies but none of the remaining candidates is up to or over theluota, the candidate who at what stage has the lowest vote is eliminated.CONFIDENIIAL   .
His votes are transferred to the remaining unelected candidates in accordancewith the next available preferences shown.12.If no-one is brought up to the quota, the candidate with the next lowesttotal of votes is excluded and his votes transferred.13.3 process of transferring surpluses or eliminating the lowest candidateappropriate is continued until all the vacant seats are filled.^&apos;    Recounts may be demanded of each stage of the count as described in thepreceding paragraphs.   The request for a recount must be made after thecompletion of the stage whose recount is demanded but before the commencementof the next stage.    No recount is permitted of the count as a whole.inNorthern Ireland elections.1 rJ&apos;    Suitable provision would be needed for nomination and deposit.   In theRepublic of Ireland, a candidate loses his deposit if he fails to secure3 of the quota at any stage.    In the Northern Ireland Assembly and Conventionelections, the deposit was lost if the candidate did not secure     of the quota at any stage.16.Vacancies arising between general elections may be filled in one of threeways.   The first involves a by-election using the STY system as described above.    The member thus elected is elected with an absolute majority of votes.Alternatively, the ballot papers cast at the general election for theretiring member may be re-examined and allocated to the other candidates inaccordance with the next available preferences of the voters.    Or the vacancycould be filled by co-option from bhe^ar\&amp;*^p*eite-titQd. by the retiringAnyone who is brought up to or over the quota after the elimination of the lowest candidate is declared elected and his surplus, if any, is transferredas described in paragraph &quot;5 above.
