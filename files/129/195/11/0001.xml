DOCUMENT IS THE PROPER.TY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTq 0CP(77) 36 COPY NO18 April 1977CABINETCOMMUNITY AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT PRICES 1977-78Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodINTRODUCTION1. The Council of Ministers (Agriculture) meets on 25-26 April to resumeconsideration of Community agricultural support prices for 1977-78.    I have discussed the line we should take with my colleagues of the Committee on european Questions, and in this paper I report our conclusions.THE PRESENT situation. The package which Mr Gundelach put forward during the last council meeting, and which the eight other member countries have accepted,represents considerable progress for us, compared with the Commissionsoriginal proposals.    In particular, it halves the Commission&apos;s proposalfor a change in the green pound;  and it proposes a special subsidy on community butter sold in the United Kingdom averaging about 7^p andfinanced wholly by Community funds.    But this does not go quite as far as we wanted;  and the revised package also adds j per cent to the common price increases of 3 per cent originally proposed.THE PROPOSED line. My colleagues and I recognise that there is no chance of reducingthe common price increases of 3^ per cent to which all other member countries are now pledged.    In seeking a better deal on the green poundand butter subsidy we should however seek also to secure an offsetting ofthe effect on United Kingdom food prices of the additional \ per cent increase.    Our aim should therefore be to ensure that the butter subsidyis sufficient to offset the effect on the cost of food to United Kingdomconsumers in the 1977-78 farm year (ending March 1978) of a. the changein the green pound and b. the additional \ per cent increase in commonprices.    It is helpful in this connection that we have already saved a monthof increased prices through the deferment of a settlement.1
4. Tiiis aim could be achieved by ire x* easing the butter subsidy, by reducing the green pound change, by phasing in the application of thechange, or by some combination of the three.    If the timing and extentof ihe green pound change remained unchanged, then we should require a subsidy of not less than 33 units of account per 100 kg (8-^p per lb), worthover  64 million to consumers, to offset a green pound effect of  52 million and the \ per cent price increase effect of  12 million.    But I shall try toget more than this.5. If we secure some improvement but not enough to satisfy thesecriteria in full, I shell consult the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary on whether the revised deal should be accepted, in the light of the wider considerations bearing on a continued confrontation with all other member countries.conclusion. I invite my colleagues to note the line, as set out above, which theCommittee on Community Questions has agreed we should take at themeeting of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on 25-26 April.J S ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food13 April 197Y2
