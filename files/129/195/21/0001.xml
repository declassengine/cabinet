CP(77) 466 May 1977CABINETHOUGHTON COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL AID to political PARTIESMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. When the Cabinet discussed the report of the Houghton Committee on13 January (CM(77) 1st Conclusions, Minute 3) I was asked to raise thematter again after the Easter Recess in the light of opinion at that time.This memorandum analyses the options which appear open to us.2. A summary of the report&apos;s recommendations is appended.Essentially, the report recommends the introduction of two schemes:i. Annual grants, totalling about  ljr million a year, to be paid from the Exchequer to the central Party organisations for their general purposes, the amounts being determined according to each party&apos;s electoral support at the preceding General Election.ii. At local level, the limited reimburoement, costing in the region of  860,000 a year, of the election expenses of Parliamentary andlocal government candidates.3. My view remains that, notwithstanding the objections in the minorityreport (which have had general backing from the Conservatives and theNationalist Parties), the Committee makes out a convincing case for both these schemes.    Their adoption would represent a valuable strengthening of the democratic process at relatively small cost, and the experience ofother countries has shown that the risks of any subsequent loss of Partyindependence have been much exaggerated.    Clearly, however,implementation would be contentious.4. Legislation would be necessary for the introduction of either or both of the schemes.    But to move straight to legislation would expose theGovernment to the possibility of an embarrassing defeat, no doubt helped byopposition within our own Party.    It would also be open to the criticism that on an issue of this character we should first sound out Parliamentaryopinion.    Some form of general debate in the House seems an essentialfirst step if the chances of implementation are to be maximised.copy NOR -DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
5. Such a debate could be on a formal &quot;take note&quot; Motion, or on a motion expressing agreement with the Committee&apos;s proposals.    Whichevercourse was followed, we could not avoid some expression of Ministerialviews.    The degree of Government commitment would be greater ifexpressed in a Motion, and the effects of an adverse vote in such circum-stanceo more likely to rule out any further action in this Parliament;  and ifa free vote (pressure for which might not easily be resisted) was allowed,the debate might be ill-attended and any division unrepresentative of opinion in the House as a whole.    on balance, the best chance of keeping open ouroptions on subsequent legislation seems to lie in a formal &quot;take nots&quot;Motion, with the Government view expressed (without undue commitment) inthe course of debate.6. If this course were followed, we would have to decide whether theGovernment should indicate readiness to adopt the entire report, orwhether there might be advantage in proceeding by stages, with theGovernments proposals at this stage related only to the recommendations which seem likely to be least contentious.7. The proposal for annual grants to central organisations has been criticised on the grounds that it would undermine their independence andthe voluntary principle and possibly open the way to State support for theNational Front;  and also, from within the Labour Party, on the basis thatsuch grants might unbalance the existing structure of financial support.On the other hand, the proposals for limited reimbursement of candidates&apos;expenses (including those of independents), with extension to elections to theEuropean Parliament and devolved assemblies in due course, havegenerally met much less criticism.    These can be readily presented asstrengthening election processes as a whole, rather than the party political sti-uoture - although they would, of course, assist centralorganisations indirectly - and I see a much better chance of Parliamentarysupport if we were to give priority to a scheme for the limited reimburse-ment of candidates&apos; expenses.8. There has been little recent public comment on the report and therehave been few references in Parliament.    When the Parliamentary LabourParty (PLP) discussed the report last November tha reaction was generallyfavourable although the attendance was very limited.    A PLP Sub-Committee has since indicated majority support for a system of aid basedon the Houghton principles although proposing a number of variations in the detailed scheme.    The National Union of Labour Organisers urged earlyimplementation of Houghton in a booklet published in February.9. Before any debate I would discuss the matter again with the PLP,this time in the context of a &quot;take note&quot; Motion with Government support for early legislation being confined to the proposals on candidates&apos; expenses.    Iwould similarly sound out the Liberals (who have in general favoured fullimplementation) and would seek to establish whether the Conservativesmight be willing to support legislation confined to expenses.
10.        I seek the agreement of colleagues to the arrangement of an early&quot;take note&quot; debate on the lines indicated above, and to the prior consul -tations proposed in paragraph 3.     The issues of Ministerial responsibilityfor reimbursement of candidates&apos; expenses and other issues of organisationand administration can be considered in the light of the outcome of thede bate.M fPrivy Council Office6 May 19773
appendix summary OP recommendations we recommend the introduction of a system of state financial aid for political parties in the United Kingdom,Such aid should take the form of:i. annual grants to he paid from Exchequer funds to the centralorganisations of the parties for their general purposes, the amountsbeing determined according to the extent of each party&apos;s electoralsupport;ii, at local level, a limited reimbursement of the election expensesof Parliamentary and local government candidates.In order to qualify for a grant a party must at the previous general electionhave&apos; either:a,    saved the deposits of its candidates in at least six constituencies;or      b.   had at least two of its candidates returned as Members;or    . c,   had. one of its candidates returned as a Member, and received as a party a total of not less than 150,000 votes.The amount of the annual grant payable to each of the qualifying parties shall be calculated on the basis of 5p* for each vote cast for its candidatesat the previous general election.The scheme for the limited reimbursement of candidate^ election expenses should apply to all Parliamentary elections, and to all elections for county and dis-trict councils in England and Wales, regional, island and district councils inScotland, and the Greater London Council and London borough councils.one-Reimbursement should be restricted to those candidates who poll at leasteighth of the votes cast, and the amount to be reimbursed should be thecandidate1s actual election expenses up to a.limit of half his legally per-mitted maximum expenditure.   Payment shall be made directly to the candidate.It is recommended that the first payment of the proposed annual grants payable to the parties should be on 1 April 1977, and that the scheme for the limitedreimbursement of candidates&apos; election expenses should operate for allParliamentary and relevant local government elections held on or after 1 April,1977.The total cost of state aid to the political parties under these proposal is estimated at, on average, about  2j million a year.   Of this, the annualgrants to the parties would comprise about  1,440,000 and the reimbursement of candidates^ election expenses approximately  860,000 a year (including 360,000 in respect of Parliamentary candidates and  500,000 for local govern-ment candidates).It is proposed that the reimbursement schemes should be extended to includeelections to the European Parliament and to the Scottish and Welsh Assembliesas occasion arises.
