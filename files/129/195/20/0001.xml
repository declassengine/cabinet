I DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(?7) 45 COPY no. 5 May 1977CABINET831977 UPRATING or SOCIAL SECURITY benefits memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Servicesand the Minister for Social SecurityINTRODUCTION1. We must now decide on this year&apos;s uprating of social security benefits to come into force in the week beginning 14 November 1977.    It isclear that, over the period November 1976 to November 1977, prices will go up faster than earnings, so the statutory provisions require that the upratingof all benefits this year will be governed by the rise in prices.LAST YEAR-S EXPERIENCE2. The Treasury forecast for inflation between last November and thisNovember is 13.1 per cent.    But last year&apos;s experience argues strongly fora safety margin.    The forecast then was that earnings would rise by12. 5 per cent and prices by 11. 2 per cent between November 1975 and november 1976.    Short-term benefits were increased by 16 per cent and pensions by 15 per cent to allow a real improvement in their value.    Indeed,Ministers claimed in public that the uprating would raise the real value ofpensions &quot;to a new peak&quot;.     But this did not happen.    Contrary to the forecast, prices rose faster than earnings, the uprating left us no margin atall over inflation, and we  avoided a fall in the real value of the pension by-only a hair&apos;s breadth.3. Last year&apos;s margin was almost four per cent over the forecast risein prices.    Without that margin the Government would have been in veryserious political difficulties -a. Our supporters in the House and in the country would nothave tolerated a fill in the pension1 s real value.b. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) would have been extremely .angry and support for the social contract seriously eroded.c. We would have come under strong pressure for an expensive and administratively difficult interim uprating.1
THE NEED FOR A MARGIN THIS YEAR4. Last year&apos;s narrow escape makes clear the need for a prudentmargin in chis year&apos;s uprating;  and in some ways the case for a margin seven stronger this year.    In the Spring of 1976 the rate of inflation wasfalling steadily, and our prediction that it would reach single figures by theend of the year was widely accepted.    At present, by contrast, inflation isrunning at over 16 per cent and may well get worse before it gets better.In these circumstances pensioners, the public at large, the Party, the tuc and many commentators would condemn a 13 per cent uprating as grosslyinadequate.    It might prove difficult to secure a Parliamentary majority inJune for the affirmative resolution order required.    And, even if the forecast is correct, we would suffer six months of odium before it was seen to be so.5, There must also be a residual doubt in our own minds about thereliability of the forecast.    In the four months November 1976 to March 1977prices have already risen by just over 6 per cent.    That leaves room for arise of less than 6, 7 per cent in the eight months to November 1977 if the forecast is to prove correct.    Given that the inflation rate is not expected to fall below 16 per cent for several months yet, it will have to come down to only about \ per cent a. month in the three or four months up to November.It may do so, but in the light of recent experience we would be unwise to count on it.6. If we fail to preserve the real value of pensions it will be difficult to resist pressure for an interim uprating next year.    This would be administratively expensive and, for operational reasons, could not be beforeMay 1978.    We would then be under strong pressure to cover not only theloss of value to November 1977 but also the rise in prices betweenNovember 1977 and Spring 1978.    A isafe.margin now could prove cheaper inthe long run.7. A mere 13 per cent uprating would also place us in a most difficult position in relation to p\iblic service pensions.    Under the Pensions(Increase) Acts public service pensions are inflation-proofed.    The June toJune figures used for this purpose will probably mean a rise of around17 per cent payable from December (unless we can legislate to reduce our commitment, which seems unlikely).    We would be in great difficulty if wewere to give a much lower increase to ordinary pensioners than to those inthe public services.proposals. Last year&apos;s uprating provided a margin of nearly 4 per cent over the expected rise in prices.    Because of the need for continued restraint in public spending we must accept a lower margin this year, and in our view anuprating of around 16 per cent would be prudent.
9. This figure would raise pensions by  2. 50 for a single person and 4 for a married couple.    The new rates of  17.80 and  28.50 would beexactly the figures recommended by the TUC in their 1977 Economic Review,and this fact would greatly strengthen the Government&apos;s position in the stage Three talks.10.       For the short-term benefits we propose the same 16 per cent increase as for pensions, giving smaller cash increases for  2, 10 for a single person and  3.40 for a married couple.    These lower cash increases will prevent incomes of those out of work getting too high relative to incomes ofworking people.    The ordinary supplementary benefit scale rates go up bythe same cash amounts as short-term insurance benefits, so any lowerincrease in short-term benefits would hit not only the sick and theunemployed (the vast majority ot whom are out of a job through no fault oftheir own) but also many disabled people, widows and one-parent families -needy groups often dependent on supplementary allowances.COST11.       Our Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESC) allocation for the uprating depends on the inflation forecast, and any increase in benefitsbeyond the forecast is therefore a call on the Contingency Reserve.    Thetotal cost of our proposals is  631 million in 1977-78 and  1, 559 million in1978-79.    The cost to the contingency reserve would be  125 million in1977-78 and  310 million in 1978-79.    (Colleagues should know that we willalso be seeking a substantial sum from the Reserve to increase child benefit in April 1978. )   In our view this expenditure is justified because -a. an uprating which failed to cover inflation would be disastrous;b. the level of pensions is central to the political and electoralstanding of the Government;c. our social priorities as a Government are at stake.CONCLUSION12.       We seek our colleagues&apos; agreement to an uprating order which from mid-November will increase the standard single rate of pension by  2. 50a week and the single rate of ehort-term benefits by  2. 10 a week, withother rates of benefit, including the supplementary benefit scale rates,rising pro rata.    The uprating must be arnounced before the Spring recess,and the latest practicable date is 25 May.    To give time for administrative arrangements a decision must be made by 19 May at the latest.    We would hope to take the affirmative resolution order through both Houses by the endof June.D ES ODepartment of Health and Social Security5 May 19773
