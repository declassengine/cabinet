In CP(77) 40, relating to the diaft Green Paper for England andWales, the Home Secretary said that a parallel Scottish document, who?lyconsistent with the England and Wales one, would be cleared bycorrespondence.    I attach accordingly a draft Scottish Green Paper whichreflects discussions in the Ministerial Steering Group on the Financing ofLocal Government.2. The Introduction to the Paper explains the distinctive features ofthe Scottish local and central government systems which justify a separate,different response, particularly in the general chapters on central/localrelations and consultation between central and local government.Differences in statutes and practice account for divergences (where possibleexplained in the text) in other respects, in the chapters on rate support grant, capital expenditure, and audit and value for money, and in the second part of the chapter on sources of local revenue (dealing with improvements to the rating system).3. Where differences are not significant the Scottish document followsthe English one as closely as possible as is the case in chapter 4 on specific grants and in the first part of chapter 6 dealing with rate6 and other taxes.4.

production*1    This Green Paper Bets out the Government&apos;s initial conclusions on the main issues covered in the Report of the Layfield Committee of Inquiry into LocalGovernment Finance (Cmnd 6453) so far as Scotland is concerned.   A separate paper is being published for England and Wales (Cmnd ).1.2    The broad lines of the Governments thinking on the issues raised by thel&amp;yfield Report are the same for Scotland as for England and Wales.   But. as theGoaaaittse recognised, the organisation of local government in Scotland and the formof its relationship with central government differ substantially from the poeitioain England and Wales.1.3    In all three countries local government has, of course, been reorganised inrecent years.   Among the consequences of this reorganisation in Scotland was asubstantial reduction in the number of authorities (there are now nine regions,fifty-three districts and three all-purpose island authorities) and in the spanof variation in local authority resources.   Within the new structure one authority(Strathclyde) now covers nearly half the population and the Regional Council is responsible for over kO per cent of total local authority expenditure.   These changes are very significant for the relationship between central and local government,particularly in financial matters.IA    Another distinctive feature of the Scottish structure is that nearly all localauthority functions are the responsibility at central government level of oneMinister, the Secretary of State for Scotland.   As a result it is possible for oneMinister to deal with local authority problems in the round: because of kisdepartmental responsibilities the Secretary of State is himself familiar with the ,problem of priorities and resources over the whole field of local authority work,aad the number of authorities makes it possible for the Departments of the scottish office to be in close and regular touch with them all.1*5    Another important feature is the representation of local authorities ae avhole.   Whatever the precise for s of the relationship between eentral and localgovernment which emerges from consideration of the Layfield Report, It would be*rong in the Government&apos;s view for local authorities to be mere agents of centralgovernment.   For reasons explained in the next section, the Government agree that the relationship should have at least; some of the characteristics of a partnership-, and
for this purpose the way in which local authorities arrange for the resolution andexpression of their views is of great importance.   Following reorganisation the       .new authorities set up a single representative body, the Convention of scottish local Authorities,   The existence of such a body has already proved to be of great significance in. setting the pattern of relationships between central ana localgovernment in Scotland.1*6    This paper provides tho basis for further consultation with interested bodies,ln particular with the Convention from whom the Secretary of State has alreadydeceived a memorandum of observations which shows some measure of agreement with thevicws which follow.    Under the Scotland and wales Bill the Central Government&apos;s*ssponsibility for most local government functions will be devolved to a ScottishExecutive and Assembly and the Government will consider the timing of any amending legislation on local government finance in the light of progress with the Bill.j
-   central/local relations2*i  The L&amp;yfield Committee were concerned about what they saw as wide;cesfusicn in the relationship between central end local government and put fc**Q alternative bases for clarifying and redefining that relationship - a centralistapproach which would frankly recognise the need for significant centra], interventionlocal government, and a localiet approach which would increase the freedom ofiocal authorities to canage their own affairs.   The committee thought this lattersolution would entail the placing of a much greater proportion of the cost of local services on the local population and involve the introduction of a local income taxto supplement rates and increase the accountability of local government towards4*s electors.   A minority of the Layfield Committee rejected these extremes of&quot;centralism&quot; and &quot;localism&quot; and suggested instead a &quot;middle way&quot; in which theGovernment would set minimum standards for services which local authorities wouldbc&apos; required to meet, leaving thea free to provide higher standards if they sowished,2*2    The Convention in thair memorandus acknowledge that it is not possible, eventhrough the introduction of new sourcos of revenue, to avoid a continuing centralGovernment interest in local government services.   They recognise that centralKovernaent controls are inevitable, but emphasise the importance of local discretionconsider that local government can play a very useful participative role in theCeatra?,./locftl relationship.   They suggest that the way ahead is to make the natureof this relationship more explicit through the employment by central government of, what they reg-urd as.*ij^9ct controls on expenditure instead of using/inappropriate mechanisms sucn asRestriction of the overall level of government grants.2,3    The Government accept that the dividing line between central and localResponsibilities is not always clear.   The central/local relationship Is changing,*ll the time  because national economic and social prioritiesalter substantially even within quite short periods..   It is not long forSample, since government policy favoured rapid expansion in local services, buteu^seqUent developments in the economy have meant restrictions on the growth of^public expenditure in general including the local government sector.   Any formal4efinition of central and local responsibilities would lack the advantages of^xibility and rapidity of response to new circumstances.   The Governments viewie. therefore, that while clarification of responsibility wherever practicable isArable, a fundamental redefinition is not necessary as a basis for solving
Problems of local government finance.   The disadvantages of both the central   taad Iccalist approaches are clear, and the Government do    not think there :case for the adoption of either.2^    The Government think that the minority of the Committee were right toemphasise the importance of seeking a middle way but they would regard as unrealistic* aiddlc way which/reduce   the whole relationship between local and centralGovernment to a simply defined form of allocation of responsibilities.   rather the Government see the duties and responsibilities involved in the provision ofI kcal public services as being shared on a partnership basis between central attending xccal government.   Within this framework the balance of responsibilities will vary0v&quot; r time as circumstances change.2o    In Scotland, as already noted, the number of local authorities represented by&amp; eingle Convention is not large and one Minister is responsible for nearly allkc-al government matters.   This provides a simple foundation on which it should be*088ible to construct a relationship in which the roles of the parties concerned are*o*e clearly defined, and can be comprehended by the parties and by ratepayers more**6ily.   The Government agree with the Convention that the way ahead is to develop the present relationship in this direction.2*6    The present relationship is expressed through many links between the Secretary0? State sud elected members and between departmental officials concerned with^ticul&amp;r services *nd their opposite austere in local government.   It centres onthe financial arrangements under which central government provides in Scotland about two-thirds of the money required to fund the net spending of local authorities   (after deducting rents and other income* and exercises control over the level of capital**PeRditux-e incurred by local authorities.   It is this financial relationship whichwUl be the principal subject of discussion with the Convention, and the mechanism&apos;*bich links central government to local authorities will be examined with a viewto &quot;Making clearer the respective roles of central and local government.   Towards this government propose therefore that when a new policy initiative is taken on  Bemce, the relationship between central and local government in carrying it outB!lould be set out as clearly as pocsible.The heart of the problem can be simply stated.   Local authorities&apos; policies^ Lect local priorities in relation to the services they provide.   Central gopolicies reflect national priorities, at least some of which impinge *
1administration in which local authorities operate.    Inevitably these prioritiesJ*U be in conflict from time to time.   What is required is machinery within whiconflicts can be considered and resolved in a way which clearly identifieskl*e : ; involved.   The machinery must also provide for recognition of the need*o orecerve a healthy local democracy as well as to carry forward the policies toWhich Ministers attach importance.   Quite apart from the issue of policy priorities,Central government must also be able to ensure that local spending plans in total doHot pxM-judice central economic objectives.Xn general, the Government propose to continue a block grant as the principalsupport to the cost of local services, with a limited role for specific grants.Capital expenditure controls are also required,   These matters are discussed inSweater detail in the following sections..
PAKl- 3 - KATU SUPPORT GRANT3.1   The main features of rate support grant (RSG) are common to Scotland, WalEngland.   RSG is a block grant given in aid of local authority revenuesgenerally.   In Scotland, there is an annual cycle of consultations between theScottish Office and representatives of the Convention of Scottish Local Authoritto assess various factors relating to the level of &quot;relevant expenditure&quot;    -   oniocal authority services in the next financial year, chiefly variations in thedemand for and cost of such services.   The Secretary of State then determines as* Percentage of relevant expenditure the aggregate amount of grants to be madeliable to local authorities for the ensuing year.3,2costWithin this aggregate, provision is first made for certain grants towards theof specific services (eg police).   The balance forms tho total RSG for the that total is divided into 3 elements - &quot;needs&quot;, &quot;resources&quot; and &quot;domestic&quot;,distribution of the needs element reflects local spending needs; the resourcesdement compensates for deficiencies in local rating resources; and the domesticdement reduces the call which would otherwise be made on domestic ratepayers.   TheRSG total and the amounts of the .3 elements, together with certain of the^tribution arrangements, are prescribed in the annual Rate Support Grant orders.3&apos;3  The   substantial scale of the Government&apos;s contribution towards local authoritye*P^diture (referred to in paragraph 2.6) is bound to affect the total of that^expenditure.   In fact, in recent years the settlement of the level of rate support6f5tlt has become, along with the issue of guidance, a method of influencing thel0c*l authority part of public spending.   The RSG settlement was not designed for economic management and its use for this purpose is not conducive to a wholly^sfactory relationship between central and local government.Xh As already explained, central government have a proper interest in the mannerlU vhich local authority current expenditure reflects national as well as localpities.   This interest can be, and is, expressed in the form of specific grantsVhich enable an influence to be exercised over the policies governing expendstbe s   evant&quot; expenditure for any year-, is broadly the aggregate expenditure whic^Cif?retary of state estimates&quot;would fall to be met from rates if no RSG or*^Vqh       rants for certain services were payable.   The aggregate excludes housinglUe account expenditure and may also exclude payments of other description,-.;
j as stated in paragraph 2..S above, specific grants can only have a limited role in a system based on the block grant and local authority discretion in its use.Sue discretion may be influenced to reflect government priorities by guidanceoffered to local authorities in departmental circulars, but while localauthorities are usually responsive to such guidance, there is no certainty thatit will be put into effect consistently in all areas.   Approval of capitalexpenditure under section 9^ of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, whichexercises a greater degree of control than that exercised over current expenditure &quot;ill take into account Government as well as local authority priorities.3.5  A difficulty has been the absence of any quantified link between theGovernments public expenditure plans (at least so far as current expenditure isconcerned) and the budgets of local authorities.   This has resulted in complaintsfrom the Government side of overspending in the aggregate by local authorities and,* the local authority side, that individual authorities were not in a positionto know when fixing these budgets, whether or not they were in line with theI Governments plans.   This has led in the last few years to the issue by the scottish office of indicative guidelines designed to help authorities at the stage ol budgetPreparation.   Those guidelines - which in aggregate correspond to the relevant totalsin the Governments published expenditure plans - are in no sense mandatory and intie absence of any objective measurement of comparative need they cannot be regarded&amp; core than approximations.j 3.6 In the Governments view, local autonomy would be seriously undermined if theGovernment were to set either cash limits on the total of current local expenditure (ie not just on Exchequer support) or a maximum permissible percentage limit onfate increases.   The task is to develop more effective means of influencing thetotal through revised financial arrangements which are clear in purpose and which,. ^ie imposing a discipline on individual authorities consistent with the GovernmentsI lateral economic policy, allow them reasonable freedom to determine their total&apos; fcdgets and their internal priorities.   In improving the financial machinery in this aspect two requirements which the Layfield Committee considered important will need to be taken into account.*7 The first is accountability.   The structure should display a clear distinctionKtveen, on the one hand, the decisions of central government on the size anddistribution of grant and, on the other, local decisions on the level of rates.
present system achieves this to a considerable extent but it can be ircThe second requirement is fairness.   Progressive improvements in the asses;needs have been made and are refdectcd in the distribution of grant.   This&quot;&quot;ist continue, with special emphasis on the desirability of making the systemcomprehensible to local authority members and ratepayers.3*8 One way of achieving this would be by the unitary grant system describedia the Layfield Report.   The unitary grant system would require an assessmentOfa&apos;     what each authority would need to spend to provide a comparable overalllevel of service (these assessments in total being consistent with the government&apos;s public expenditure plans); and h.     the product for each authority of a .     &quot;    .... standard rate poundageat which authorities should be able to finance this overall level of service.&quot;hltai-y grant payment would meet the difference, for any particular authority,ween a. and b.   Each authority would know its assessed spending need and cuulduse -,-4.*c as a guideline for its overall current expenditure total.   Authorities would^eo to spend more or less than the guideline, and expenditure in excess of thedeline would still be in receipt of grant, but at a progressively lower rate ofPpOrt.   Thus spending in excess of assessed need would have to be financedeasing:iy by ratepayers.   Each authority&apos;s assessed spending need would be^ehed as would the standard rate poundage.   It is obviously desirable thatan arragement should be based on a wiae measure of agreement on how needyt0 be assessed.&apos;  Although the Layfield Committee thought that there could be advantage ini fining ^ne nee(i6 fiXl&amp; resources elements of the block grant in a unitary granteed of treating them separately (in order to achieve equity of distribution ofL among local authorities;, the Report acknowledges that there are fewerStages for such a grant in Scotland.   One important advantage for England andis that a unitary grant would enable the Government to compensate authoritiesy for differences in their rating resources; due to the wide spread of ratinev    rces in England end Wales this cannot be achieved under the present system.Cotl.and however, as Layfield acknowledged, the spread of rating resources is
smaller and the resources of all authorities can be brought close to theof that of the authority with the highest per capita rateable value by usinglittle as 20$ of the total grant.   In addition there are in Scotland man;/authorities and the grant system is more readily comprehensible to ratepayerseach authority receives grant directly from the Government as the rate demanshow.5.10   Another possible approach to the assessment of spending need could be through an extension of the financial planning system recently introduced for capitalexpenditurc (see section 5) to cover current expenditure.   This would involveReparation of plans by authorities showing their estimated current spending ja period of years ahead.   These would be discussed between central and localgovernment with a view to reconciling central objectives and local spending nefas seen b&quot;-r the authorities.3.U These and any other possible approaches will be considered in the thoroughReview of the arrangements for the calculation and distribution of RSG which theGovernment propose to undertake with the Convention.i. the grant system can promote equity in the treatment of ratepayers inAfferent areas, there is some controversy whether the principle of equal rateAdages for equal service levels is the right one.   The Committee considered that because of differences in the rateable value of domestic properties of similar type,*ize and quality, equalisation should be related to an area&apos;s total personal**ther than to its total rateable value.   They therefore recommended that theof&apos; the grant distribution should be to make the proportion of aggregate income takenh domestic rates in each local authority area the same, assuming similar standardsservice.3-13   There are strong objections to this proposal.    Domestic rate bills would becomeamalgam of two different bases of taxation which would compromise the use ofPupation of domestic property as a valid basis for taxation in its own right,H would, be complex to administer and involve the collection of data on personalin0ome for each local authority area.   Rat-payers would find it much more difto see the link between their authority&apos;s level of expenditure and its rate poNor could they seo how the rate poundage compared with that of other author:Vl*eover, because only the aggregate of personal income in each authority won.tf*en Lnt0 acC0unt, the effect would bo to increase the rate burdens of pecb*low average incomes living in local authorities whose aggregate income was   hoveit.

The Government do no-there fore propose to pursue this recommendation.-akin
-   SPECIFIC grants the greater part of the Government&apos;6 assistance to local authorities is and^ill continue to be given in the form of a block grant to be deployed by IcealAuthorities at their discretion subject to their meeting their statutoryions.   This is essential if local democracy is to be preserved andmayftaceursged.   However, circumstances/arise when the Government wish to safeguard orPromote a service or particular activities within a service.   For this purpose localAuthorities are either reimbursed or receive Exchequer support in theform of specific grants (Specific grants taken into account in the RSG settlement^present about 7&amp; of total grant and arc paid at varying fixed percentage;,^ards expenditure on specific services. )k -jThe Government consider that speciiic grants ffiay be appropriate in theSlewing circumstances:(a) to give special encouragement to expenditure on particularactivities or services where there is a strong national interest;I(b) to compensate local authorities for the cost of activitiesengaged in at the request of central government where theauthority has little or no discretion over the amount ofexpenditure incurred;(c) to supplement block grant in relation to typee of expenditure the need for which arises too unevenly, as between areas oryearsv to be reflected in the assessment of expenditure needs;(d) to assist a local authority in the financing of expenditureundertaken for the benefit of a wider area than its own.h *There will be a continuing need for specific grants, but the purposes to4cn they are put will change with time.   On the one hand new problems will ariseW^ieh can be tackled most appropriately by the payment of such grants.   Oa thoQer hand expenditure on certain activities which are currently funded by each^aate may in the future be met out of rate support grant when the special needs* specific grant have become lees obvious or less pressing.
*****    Thc Government will want to discuss with the Convention any proposals foran extension of specific grants for local services and also propose to exam: neexisting specific grants against the criteria set out in paragraph **.2 above
5 -   CAPITAL expenditure .1    The Government used to influence the capital expenditure of local authoritiesto ensure that the aggregate of local authority capital expenditure conforms :Plane for public spending, that a balance Is achieved between servicesv and that areasonable uniformity of standards is maintained among authorities.   The LayfieldCommittee said that, in recent years, control over the total of capital investment by loan sanctions h*d been one of the main instruments for influencing total localauthority expenditure and criticised two aspects of this: first, that it created* bi&amp;c in favour of capital rather than revenue expenditure since local authoritiesbid for loan sanctions and felt obliged to use them when granted: it alsodiscouraged a proper evaluation of the current expenditure consequences of capitalexpenditure   For macro-economic purposes control of capital expenditure inEolation was therefore unsatisfactory in that it was partial in its application^d could have distorting effects on resource allocation.5-2    The loan sanction system criticised by the Layfiold Committee has been^Placed in Scotland by the requirement in section 9^ of the Local Government(Scotland) Act 197? that local authorities should not incur any liability to meetCaPital expenses except with the consent of the Secretary of State.   It is^Suable whether these arrangements create a bias in favour of capital expenditure.Government have had to take action in recent years to restrain local authority6*Penditurc ana there are signs that local *^^^%^t^%$J^d^CaPital allocations as limits rather than targets/.   The Government recognise,ho*ever, that control of capital expenditure alone has given rise to problems iu the***t, especially where insufficient account has been token of the current expenditure^sequences of capital expenditure.5&apos;3    On the basis of the requirements of section 9k. the Secretary of State has,  .^consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, introduced a^financial pisnnijag system covering most of the main local authority capital**0grumr,ef, froB 1977-78 onwards.   A priory purpose of the system is to ensure that,the context of the annual Public Expenditure Survey, the Secretary of State is^orssa of local authorities&apos; capital expenditure commitments as well as theirN*sals for new capital works, and that local authorities are given as much***edoffl as possible to make their own assessments of local priorities withinf*atraints of tho main programme block allocations to which consent has been given***** section 9&apos;v.   The system will be modified in the light of experience, bu***6ent intention is that it should be extended to include other capital pro
The possibility of extending the financial planning system to local authoritycurrent expenditure is to be discussed with the Convention.   If it should prpossible to encompass current as well as capital expenditure within a finaneplanning system, current consequences of capital expenditure would be fully into account and any undue bias towards capital expenditure avoided.
many6 - SOURCES OF LOCAL REVENUE (Rates, other taxes, and fees and charges)6.1    The previous sections have outlined the Government&quot;8 proposals for strengthening the financial machinery, particularly in relation to grant,local authorities also raise substantial sums locally from rates and from fees and charges for services.    This section examines these and other possible sourceQf local revenue.6-2     One of the major pressures which led to the establishment of the Commitwas the public concern about record increases in rate poundages.    InevitablPeople hoped that the main outcome of the Commit tee&apos;s work would he to fin--..Acceptable alternative to rates.    Unfortunately, the Committee after all theirdeliberations did not find such an alternative and they recommended that the ratingavstom should continue with some modifications.   The Government reluctantly accentthis conclusion.    They recognise of course that rates are an unpopular tax, but the-act remains that if they were abolished, the revenue would have to be raised fromother sources, which could prove to be equally or more unpopular, and not havethe advantages of rates.Sates6-3    To abolish rates and add the burden to national taxation would mean the end0f local taxation in this country.    A significant source of local income isnece&amp;s.3,y t0 preserve local democracy.    In 1976/77 for Great Britain the total yield from rates was about ^,66^7 million of which /Jl,9057 million came fro::: domesticProperty and /R2,76o7 million from commercial and industrial properties.   ThisNation yield is second only to income tax.    If the full burden of rates wasaflcUrt to inCome tax,  in 1976/77 the basic rate of income tax would hove had to beleased by /TofnJ in the  .    To replace domestic rates by revenue from incomethe basic income tax rate would have to be increased by ffio] in the  .Sternativoly if the full burden were transferred to Value Added Tax,  the standard^te would be increased to /?-?J?, if the burden of domestic rates were transferredto VAT,  the standard rate would be /VfJj.    Neither of these options could be**8arded as an acceptable or less painful alternative to   rates.Rates have many advantages as a local tax which were noted by the Committee,^a tax structure is a reasonably simple one, and the yield is predictable: it is*s* to administer locally,  the costs of collection are low and evasion is difficult.As the tax is on immovable property it can be readily identified with particularlocal areas; and there is no serious problem about confidentiality of informatio:ledtax
Morratconcern.about the activities of local governmentoreover rotes are perceptible.    They provide a very apparent connection betweenepayers and their local authority so maintaining democratic interest andIt i;thp6-5     On the other hand, many criticisms are made of the rating system,alleged that rates bear no relationship to ability to pay, that they have lucres,dramatically in recent years, that they are unfair because wage earners who arenot householders do not contribute to local taxes, that they are a tax on onecessity and that they bear no relationship to the services enjoyed by the rate-Payers.    In addition many detailed criticisms &quot;nave been made of the way the systels operated.6.6     The Committee examined these criticisms and concluded that many were basedon   misconceptions.   Kates are in fact progressive for lower income earners, dueWffe-J&quot; *r the- assistance riven to nearly one third of households by the ratePate scheme and in Supplementary Benefit.    Kate payments have not increasedmatically relative to incomes in recent years.    During the years 1962 to 1974percentage of household disposable income taken by rates in Scotland remainedfairly constant at around S% with a minimum in 1974 of 3.12* and a maximum (quiteoutside the normal range) of 4.15$ i&quot; 1971.     Although earning non-householders doRot pay ratcs directly, all who pay national taxes contribute indirectly to theVgG ?art of local spending met by Government grant.    Kates are not wholly a tax&quot;i a necessity.    Trie degree to which people spend their incomes on housing and accommodation varies widely, and contains a large element of personal choice.Moreover, to the extent that rates represent a tax on a minimum level of accommodation, the rate rebate scheme alleviates the hardship which might otherwisbe imposed on the poorest.    Finally, although rates bear no direct relation toths services enjoyed by the individual ratepayer, it is a characteristic of a taxW opposed to a fee or charge) that it is not a payment directly related toSrvices provided.6*7     The Government have considered carefully the advantages and disadvantages oflho rating system.   They have concluded that the advantages outweigh the disadvantagesa&apos;nd in the absence of any preferable alternative, the system should be retained,^ey pr0p0Ge, however, to make a number of chages to meet the detailed criticisms&quot;&quot;Ade of the system and to improve and strengthen it; the proposed changes areScribed in paragraphs 6.13 - 6.20.or
OTHER TAXES &apos;&apos; Ma-V0.8   The Committee carried out a thorough review of other sources of loRevenue as a supplement, but not as an alternative,  to local rate;:.Possibilities reviewed were local income tax;    local sales taxes and mo&apos; hidefuel, duties;    local taxes on businesses, both in the form of tuxes on busijProfits and taxes on payroll or employment;    and also the possibility of :revenues   from national taxation.6.9   In considering these possibilities,  the Committee applied two mainThe first was that the tax ought to be able to produce a large enough yield topermit a significant reduction in the proportion of local authority revenufexpenditure mot by government grants.     The second was that it should be aPerceptible local tax:    its level should be set locally and people in the are;concerned should bear the effective burden and be conscious of doing so.    local .sales tax did not meet the tests of local accountability and perceptibility,would be complex to administer.     Motor vehicle fuel duty would not fosteraccountability.    Local payroll tax would not have the properties of accountabilityor perceptibility, and by varying wages and salari.es in different location?  couldConflict with regional policies.     Assigned revenues also would not fosterPceoun&apos;:ao:i.lity or be perceptible and would have no advantages over the pres n\Brant system.     The Committee concluded that none of these possibilities wasfeasible.     The Government has itself considered them carefully and agrees with theComraittee1s vi ew.6.10   The Committee established that if the national system of personal taxationWere first considerably simplified,  it would be feasible to bring a form of LITintooperation in five years time.     But they noted that the scale oi resourcesinvolved in having LIT would be considerable.     In evidence to the Committee,    the inland Revenue put the staff numbers at 12,000, involving expenditure of the orderQf  30 million a year in Great Britain as a whole, with the expectation thatroughly comparable cost in staff and finance would fall on private employers.    TheCommittee concluded that the introduction of LIT would not be warranted in a system&apos;b^sed on central responsibility.     But they saw it as a prerequisite of a localistSolution,  since they considered it would confer substantial advantages in terms ofSreatcr accountability.0.11   The objections to a localist solution have been outlined in section ?. above.Snt in any event the Government do not accept that local accountability depends months-e proportion of revenue raised locally:    or that any clear advantages would flowfroni the introduction of LIT.    The freedom of local authorities to vary the LITrate would have to be closely constrained so that it did not unduly compliCentral government economic and financial management;    and there would neoJ6ome equalisation, of the proceeds of the tax between richer and poorer are
Partly for these reasons, it seems highly questionable whether the groat.Majority of electors could bo made so aware of the LIT element in their normalAYE deductions as to achieve the Committee^ objective of securing an effectivelocal discipline on local authority expenditure decisions.   .6.12    The Government have therefore decided against the introduction of a localincome tax.   Thin decision carries no implication for the question whether theScottish Assembly should have powers to raise revenue or the forms which such powers might take.   These are matters which remain under separate consideration.^proving the rating system6.1*    The Lay-field Committee made a number of recommendations for improvements aiterations to the rating system.   The Governments conclusions, so far as theme^commendations apply to Scotland.are set out below.Valuation of domestic property6.1&apos;*    The Layfield Committee concluded that for England and Wales the nextRevaluation of dwelling houses would require to be carried out on the basis ofcapital value from which rateable value would be derived by application of a*ivicor.   For Scotland, however, the Committee concluded that sufficient evidenceVQuld be available to carry out the next general revaluation in 19?8 entirely ontQe present rental basis.   They recommended that the revaluation should proceed*8 pitieds but that the basis of valuation should be reviewed thereafter and b*Uled in good time before 198?.     The Government accept this recommendation andWiH institute a review, in consultation with interested parties, at theappropriate time.valuation of non-industrial property6*l5    At present most non-industriel property is valued first to gross annualyalue, a rental value which assumes that the landlord is responsible for the0f maintaining the property in a fit state to command that letting value,   The**oee value is converted to a net annual value (which in most cases is also
rateable value) by the application of a fixed scale of deductions, rethe Imdlord&apos;s expenses.   The Lay field Committee commented that an arbi8C^BPe/fedall properties did not necessarily reflect the variations in thof maintaining different properties, and they recommended that propertie,Present assessed to gross value should, along with industrial property, be diftseessed to net annual value.   This recommendation will be the subject of consultations after the next revaluation though its application to dwelling houseswill of course be affected by the results ef the review of the basis of assessmentMentioned in the preceding paragraph.^RATING OF AGRICULTURAL LAND AND BUILDINGS6.16    The Government accept that in terms of rating principle there are8*extremely good grounds for treating agriculture just like other industries,there are strong practical arguments against the Committee1s recommendation for th^rating of agricultural land and buildings.   First, the total income of localaut.iiorities woulci probably be unchanged because the increase in rateable value*would be balanced by a reduction in the scale of support grant from centralGovernment.   Second re-rating would involve extra costs in the revaluation of*8*cultural properties for local authorities.   Finally, there would be significantAverse affects on the financial position of the farming industry with consequential effects on home food production and food prices.   The government therefore do not propose to accept the Committees recommendatiBating of public utilities6&apos;1?    Most public utilities (eg electricity and gas undertakings and railways) arev*lued for rating purposes, or tcake rating contributions, under statutory formulaeb*0ause conventional methods cannot readily be applied.   Toe formulae are reviewed*ty the Government from time to time, in consultation with the local authority*86ociations and the undertakings concerned.   The Layfield Committee receivedMissions from some local authority associations that the review procedures were satisfactory and that the undertakings&apos; contributions were too low.   The Coamitts-*e*e unable to comment on the amount of the contributions but agreed about the*evie* procedures and recommended that responsibility for the valuation of publicCities for rating should be given to an independent body, a view endorsed by^ Convention in their memorandum.
6.18     The Government are not satisfied that such a body, whether advisor;decision-making, would necessarily improve the review procedure to the extereconciling the conflicting interests of the undertakings and the local and.    ritieany better than they are at present.   A rev? ew of formulae applicable to th*nationalised electricity, gas end railway undertakings in Scotland is in hand anathe programme of joint discussions with representatives of the undertakings and ofthe Convention must be maintained if revised formulae are to be introduced by1 April 1978.    Consideration will, however, be given to the best way in which anindependent view might be introduced in subsequent reviews.BATING 0? GOVERNMENT PROPERTY6.19    At present Government property is valued by the Treasury Valuer who then&quot;Bakes ex gratia payments in lieu of rates.    The Layfield Committee had no evidence to suggest that these payments were inadequate, but sew no reason why Crownproporty should not be valued like any other or why the normal appeals procedure should not apply except where there were special considerations, such as security.C-20    The Government believe that the present problems lie in the operation ofthe system and the absence of any formal appeal procedure, rather than in the factthat valuations are carried oat by the Treasury Valuer and that the Government make? contribution in lieu of rates.    It is the Government&apos;s intention that, in generalContributions in lieu of rates should be paid as though, the property were rateable,5nd that any exceptions to   this general rule should be clearly understood.   TheyThieve that these principles can bo satisfactorily worked out in practice bythe Government and the local authority associations.    They propose, therefore, toSot up on a Great Britain basis a joint working group with the local authority^ociations to consider the problems which have arisen in the operation of theResent system with the aim of improving existing procedures where necessary,* j *     CU.Uconsider the possibility of setting up an arbitration procedure to resolve anyrWe differences of opinion which may arise between local authorities and the&apos;easury Valuer.MATTERS*2l- Certain of the recommendations made by the Layfield Committee for improvemenlthe rrlesc------- VJ jjkjiacxu wiwiuee 1 or improvedting system are already satisfied by Scottish provisions or practice, as*ibed below.    They do not, therefore, require further consideration.
a. No remedial steps are required to provide rate relief on the        eticparts of mixed (eg domestic/commercial) properties.   Those parts are already&apos; identified in valuation rolls and attract the domestic rate poundage.b. No action is necessary to compensate local authorities through the grantarrangements for mandatory rating relief given to charities.   In Scotland,mandatory (and discretionary) reliof is deducted in calculating the pennyrate product of each area used in the distribution of the resources element of RSG.c. No action is needed to identify in rate bills the spending decisions ofdifferent tiers oi local authority, their respective grant allocations andrate poundages,   hates notices in Scotland already provide this information.d. No modification is required of tho amount of rates which ;aay be withheldin Scotland pending settlement of a valuation appeal (25 per cent of thedifference between the ratea on the value under appeal and the rates for thepreceding year).   The Layfield Committee1s observations were directed at thearrangement in England and hales.,e. Mo action is needed to limit valuation appeal rights betweenrevaluations to cases where there has been a material change of circumstances affecting value.   Such a limitation already applies in Scotland,f. Ho action is needed to adjust the Scottish arrangements for paying ratesby instalments.   Last year, this became the normal method of payment.   Thearrangements will be kept under review.FPES AND CHARGES6.22    Local authorities in Scotland financed about 15 per cent of their expenditure in 197&apos;*-?5 from fees and charges totalling about  195^.   Housing rentsaccounted for about two-thirds of the total.   The remainder came from a wide variety of services, the charges varying from case to case, some prescribed by regulation and others at the discretion of the authority.   The Layfie3.d committee considered that there was little consistency of policy or practice, either withincentral government or among local authorities, and that charges might play a biggerPart than they do now.   They recommended that there should be a joint review the policies of central and local government towards charging for locsl services.
6.P.3    The Government will discuss with the convention the scope, composition and terms of reference of such a review.   Tfcaim would bo to determine those services for which charges should be prescribecentrally and those for which the charges should be left to local discretion?remove anomalies within and among services and between local authority and other public services; to review statutory levels of charges: to recommend which services should normally be expected to cover their full costs and to recommend criteria for fixing charges.   It is not intended, however, that the scope of the review should include charges in areas of policy already under review, viz local, authority housing, passenger transport and school meals, or the question of public libracharges.
PAST ? - AUDIT AND VALUE FOR HONEY7.1    The Layfield Committee recommended that the local authority audit service should be independent of both central and local government.   The head of the nuditservice should be responsible for assigning auditors to local authorities and forthe organisation of the service, and he should publish regular reports ca mattersElating to more than one authority.   Further there should be a -higher institution1Of some sort such as a Parliamentary Committee to which the head of audit should report.   These recommendations relate to England and Wales.   The Committee recognisedthat local government reorganisation in Scotland was accompanied by a re-structuriixg0* the external audit system and stated that, with the setting up of the commission for Local Authority Accounts with direct responsibilities for all audits, the nowScottish systea -appears to be capable of development along the lines wo have recommended for England and Wales&apos;.   The Committee saw no reason why theirrcco-awandaticn to extend audit accountability to a Parliamentary Committee or someother institution should not also apply to Scotland.7*2    The Committee also recommended that the audit service should concern itselfaore with efficiency and value for money, and that it should issue comparative*reports on the way in which authorities carried out their services.7*3    The arrangements under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 tor theestablishaent of the Commission for Local Authority Accounts in Scotland seem to^oet these requirements.   While members of the Commission are appointed by theSecretary of State after consultation with the  Convention and appropriate professional bodies, tho Commission are independent of both centralgovernment and local authorities in the discharge of their functions.   The Coramissioiappoint a Controller of Audit as head of the executive audit staff and the Commissioia*-e therefore, to the Controller, a &quot;higher institution&quot;.The Controller of Audit is responsible for assigning ouditors to each localauthority; auditors may be members of the Controllers staff or the audit may becarried out by a private firm as agents of the Commission.   The Controller of Auditreport to the Commission and such reports may be brought to the attention of the* public.7*5    The Commission accept that the main objectives of the audit of localauthority accounts are to ensure that there is proper accountability for theauthority&apos;s funds, that all income due is collected and used in a legal and
efficient maiuier and that value.for coney has been obtained.   There hiis, however,keen a change during the Commission^ first year of operation from the approach to local government audit in Scotland, which was conditioned 3Regulations now repealed.   The Commission contemplate a much wider and moresystematic approach embracing in addition to the regularity of the accounts andlike matters, an examination of authorities&apos; activities for waste, extravagance andinefficiency.   The preparation of comparative studies is also under consideration.7.6    The Government believe that the reorganised audit arrangements in Scotland*eet most of the recommendations of the Layfield Committee, and they see no needfor a 1 higher institution1 while tho Commission itself performs that function.   Nochange is therefore proposed, but the arrangements will be reviewed with theConvention after a sufficient trial period.7*7   The Gommittes recommended that the Chief Financial Officer of an authority&amp;ould be pieced under a new statutory duty to report directly and regularly tothe council on defined financial issues.   The Government believe that this isNecessary since in most local authorities the Chief Financial Officer would beexpected to draw the council*s attention to matters on which the financialconsequences had not in his view been adequately presented.   Such a move wouldaleo conflict with the trend towards corporate management and the freedom ofcouncils to define their own management structures and procedures.
PART 8   -   CONSULTATION BETWEEN CENTRAL AND LOCAL government.1    The Layfield Committee believe that there is a need in Scotland (as ind mid Wales) for a forum in which Government departments and local authoritiescea discuss their forecasts, plans and priorities at a formative stage, beforeejr&apos;tering commitments on grants and the fixing of the rates of local taxation.   TheCommittee suggested that one v/ay of meeting this need might be to extend the scope and membership of the existing working party of central and local government officials on local government finance.^2    In commenting on the Comraittce&apos;s Report the Convention of Scottish LocalAuthorities found difficulty in dealing with the proposal for a forum because a scottish Assembly would introduce an entirely new dimension into central/localgovernment relationships, in that the exact relationship which would exist betweentke Assembly and Scottish local government would be largely for the Assemblythemselves to determine.   The Government regard it as essential that there should beft  lose and continuing dialogue between central and local government and they will discuss with the Convention ways of improving the existing consultation arrangements.discussion will extend to means of enabling local government to contributefurther to the annual reviews of public expenditure.
SUMMARY AND conclusions .1     This Green Paper seta cut the Government1s preliminary response to theprincipal issues raised in the report of the Layfield Committee, as they affect.Scotland with its different local and central government structures.     The paper has been written against the background of the Scotland and Wales Bill, underwhich responsibility for local government in Scotland will be devolved to theAssembly.9*2     The Government see no advantages in the centralist and localist approachesof Scottish Local Authorities-proposed by Layfield and agree with the Convention/that the way ahead is todevelop the present relationship of partnership and to consider how the finaneinmachinery can make clearer the respective roles of central and local government.9.3     The Government consider that Exchequer support, locally raised propertyrates and charges should continue as the three main sources of finance for localgovernment.     The Government believe that the abolition of rates would imposeunacceptable burdens on national taxation.     They are not convinced that it wouldbe right, as the Committee suggested, to add local income tax to existing ratesas an additional source of local revenue.     But the Government do share theCommittee1e view that other suggested forms of local taxes (including local salestax, local motor vehicle fuel duties, local payroll tax) have serious disadvantag9.4     Central government support will continue to be provided mainly in the formof a block grant not related to particular services;    but the Government willinitiate a wide review of the grant structure and the distribution arrangements,and of possible developments including unitary grant and the extension to current expenditure of the financial planning system.9.5     There will be a continuing need for specific grants for particular service the Government propose to review with the Convention the grants currently payable9.6     The financial planning system for capital expenditure recently introducedWill be continued and developed in the light of experience.     Its extension to current expenditure will be considered.9*7     The Government consider that property rates should remain as the main sourceQf locally raised revenue.     The basis of valuation for rating will be revieweda-fter the 1978 revaluation to establish whether any change is needed for subsequec^evaluations.     Other aspects of the rating system, for example the elimination ofE^oss annual values, will be included in the review as appropriate.     DeratingQf agricultural land and buildings will contintue.
9.8    The Government propose to invite the Convention of Scottish LocalAuthorities to participate in a joint review of central and local polio.ithe level of fees and charges for local services.9*9 The present system of audit of local authority accounts in Scotland meatsmost of the principles set out by the Layfield Committee.9.10    The Government attach great importance to the need for a close and continuing dialogue between central and local government and they will discussmeans of improving the existing consultation arrangements.9.11    The Government plan to open discussions scon with the Convention on theproposals outlined in this Green Paper.
