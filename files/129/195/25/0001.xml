DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77)50 COPY NO     8313 May 1977CABINETHOUSING POLICY REVIEWNote by the Lord chancellor. A comprehensive review of the housing finance system in Englandand Wales was put in hand early in 1975.    The work of the Review, whichwas supported by housing experts from outside Government, was subsequently expanded to include certain social aspects of housing policy.A parallel review of housing policy in Scotland has been carried out by theScottish Office.2. Since February this year a group of Ministers under my chairman-ship has been considering the results of the review for England and wales which were embodied in a report by an Interdepartmental Steering Group.Our conclusions take the form of the first sections of a draft Green Paper,at Annex, which deals with the main policy issues.    Chapter 2 summarises the analysis which underlies the conclusions, and lists the main objectives of housing policy.    Chapter 6 outlines the main elements in a nationalhousing policy designed to achieve these objectives.    These sections are complete subject to further minor drafting amendments.    The remainder of the draft Green Paper, which is in an advanced state of preparation,will contain a more detailed exposition of the policy proposal.    After ithas been approved by the Ministers chiefly concerned, it will be circulatedto members of the Cabinet for information.3. The principal elements of the proposed new policy described in chapter 6 of the annexed draft are:i. Local Housing Strategies and Housing investment programmes (paragraphs 6. 03 to 6.19).    More effective use ofpublic sector housing investment through the development of housing strategies prepared locally within the framework ofnational housing policy, and rolling 4-year housing investment programmes (HIPs) covering the whole range of local authority housing activity.    This will make it possible:
a. to channel investment in such a way as to make better progress in meeting the needs of the most vulnerablehouseholds and dealing with the worst concentrations of bad housing, especially in inner cities;b. to reinforce the trend towards gradual renewal bya careful combination of renovation and rebuilding;c. to allocate resources to each authority on the basisof informed judgments of priorities, while limiting detailedintervention from the centre.ii. Public Sector Subsidy (paragraphs 6.39 to 6.41).    A new and more flexible housing subsidy system which gives a larger proportion of subsidy to authorities with a big backlog of housing needs.iii. Home-ownership (paragraphs 6.24 to 6.28).    Thedevelopment of the present arrangements with the building societiesfor stabilising the supply of mortgage funds; the possibility ofsecuring fresh sources of funds through a financial intermediary;a special scheme of Government assistance for first time buyers;the sale of council houses subject to a local authority&apos;s ability todeal with pressing housing needs and to maintain a housing stock of adequate quality;  and the promotion of new forms of tenure.iv. Tenants&apos; Rights (paragraphs 6. 33 to 6. 36).    a &quot;charter&quot;to extend the rights and freedom of action of tenants, particularlyin the public sector.4. The proposals involve no commitment on the future level of housinginvestment, except to say that we still need a substantial level of investment in both the public and private sectors to help deal with thebacklog of poor housing conditions and special needs and to provide for future households.    The level of investment must be determined in thelight of the needs identified in the HIPs.    On rents, the draft (paragraph 6. 41)proposes that over a run of years rents should keep broadly in line with changes in money incomes.5. The issue of absolute &quot;equity&quot; in assistance as between the public and private housing sectors was recognised by the Ministerial Group to beunreal.    But the question of broad fairness in the treatment of these twosectors is nevertheless of some political importance in England and Wales.A tentative suggestion is therefore made that a minimum rate of subsidymight be prescribed for local authorities broadly similar to the basic rateof tax relief on mortgage interest (paragraph 6. 45).2
6. The Group were unable to resolve the question whether, as theSecretary of State for the Envii-onment proposes, the Green Paper shoaldinclude a statement of the Government&apos;s intention eventually to terminaterelief on mortgage interest at higher rates of tax (paragraphs 5. 27 and.43).    We were agreed in principle that there was no justification for suchrelief but took the view that the political implications of a commitment atthis stage to bring it to an end would need to be carefully weighed by theCabinet.    Tha Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State forthe Environment are considering this problem further and will report their conclusions separately to the Cabinet.7. Subject to this point, I invite the Cabinet to approve the annexeddraft with a view to publication of the Green Paper in about mid-June.8. The Scottish draft Green Paper, which would be compatible withthe proposals for England and Wales but modified to take account ofcertain differences in the Scottish situation, will be cleared with membersof the Cabinet in correspondence and published at the same time as the green Paper for England and Wales.E-lord Chancellor&apos;s Office13 May 19773

(confidential^)INTRODUCTORY note.     This consultation document is the outcome of a comprehensive reviewof housing policy in England and Wales which began early in 1975.*2.     The Review was initially confined largely to financial issues**.But it became clear that to restrict the Review in this way would diminishits usefulness, and so it was decided to widen its scope to include certainsocial aspects of housing - for example, the problems of those with special housing needs and the rights of tenants. It was also decided that certainissues affecting the private rented sector called for separate examination.A Review of the Rent Acts was therefore started and a consultation document was issued in January this year.3.     The work of the Housing Policy Review was supported by several committees of experts on housing matters drawn from outside Government - by an AdvisoryGroup on general issues, and Advisory Groups on Housing Services and otherspecific subjects**. The views expressed in the Green Paper are thoseof the Government, and do not necessarily represent the views of individual members of the Advisory Group or the other specialist groups.4.     The Government received a great deal of helpful evidence from interested bodies and individuals**.5.     Several official studies of relevance to housing policy have beenin progress over the last year or two:- the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Local government finance (the Layfield Report, Cmnd 6453) was published lastyear, when work on the Housing Policy Review was already well advanced;* A review of housing finance in Scotland has been carried out by theScottish Office in parallel with the present Review. Its report is being published separately.** The original terms of reference, memberships of advisory Bodies, anda list of the main submissions received are given in Annex A.I (confidential)
(confidential)- the Government announced in autumn 1976 their intention toundertake a review of the problems of inner city areas,taking account of the inner area studies which have beenin progress for the last four years, ^/and a White Paper(Cmnd        ) was published in May7;- the Government announced in September 1976 their intentionof undertaking a reappraisal of new town programmes aspart of the review of decentralisation policy. A statement was made to the House on 5 April and remaining decisions will be taken Jby the summer7&quot;;- a consultation document on transport policy was published in April 1976, and following wide ranging consultationsthe Government published a White Paper in /Mav7&quot; this year(Cmnd ).All these studies, as well as consultations on the Green Paper itself,will be taken into account in moving towards final decisions on futurehousing policy later in the year.6.     The Green Paper is intended to be reasonably self-contained. Buttwo volumes of detailed explanatory and analytical material produced inthe course of the Review are being published - A?ne at the same time as this Green Paper, and a second later in the yearT&quot;.7.     The Government hope that the Green Paper and supporting documentswill provide a sound basis for an informed public discussion of housing policy. They intend to hold consultations on the main proposals with allthe major interested parties. Those who wish to comment on the proposals should write to the Department of the Environment, Room Nll/07, 2 MarshamStreet, London SW1P 3EB, by (1 November). This will allow a period ofabout 4 months for consultation before the Government publish firm proposal5for future policy.2(confidential)
(confidential)PART chapter 1       A STARTING POINT1.1     The Government believe that all families should be able to obtain a decent home at a price within their means. This has been the dominanttheme of post-war housing policy. Although the emphasis has changed fromtime to time, the objective has remained the same. We have gone a longway towards the realisation of this traditional objective; the housing conditions of millions of families have been greatly improved in the last25 years. But serious problems remain. The Government will therefore continueto give a high priority to housing.1.2   Since the Government took office in March 1974, new directions in housing policy have been pursued:- following the Housing Act 1974, there has been a shiftaway from large schemes of clearance and redevelopmentand a new emphasis on area improvement and renewal;- the Housing Act 1974 also gave new impetus to the growth ofeviction by giving them full security of tenure;a start has been made on stabilising the flow of mortgages for home ownership by the  500M short term loans provided by government to the building societies in 1974; by the developmentof voluntary stabilisation arrangements by the Governmentand the building societies; and by the negotiation by theGovernment of &quot;support&quot; mortgage lending by the building societies to supplement direct lending by local authorities;the Housing Rents and Subsidies Act 1975 gave back to localauthorities the freedom to fix rents which was withdrawn bythe Conservative Governments Housing Finance Act 1972;housing associations as an alternative source of housing;the Rent Act 1974 freed hundreds of thousands of tenantsin furnished accommodation from the fear of arbitrary
(confidential)-   the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 ended the insecurityof the tied cottage system, from which farm workers have suffered for generations;the Government prepared legislation which places the primary responsibility for dealing with homelessness on local authorities^, and are supporting a private member&apos;s Bill to give effect to this;local authorities have been given flexibility in theuse of public sector resources in 1977/78 as the first step towards the introduction of Housing investment programmes in 1978/79.The Government now intend to develop a comprehensive policy for housingwhich they hope will be durable enough to last for many years to come.1.3   Success in overcoming our present economic difficulties is fundamentalto the generation of more resources for the future. But resources will always be limited. We shall never be able to move forward on all frontsas fast as we would wish. This means that - in housing as in other fields- it is important to make good use of available resources. Housing policydoes not exist in a vacuum,, We must recognise that the degree of priority to be given to housing has to be weighed against other claims not only for socially desirable expenditure but also for strengthening our industrialbase.1.4   Furthermore, housing policy affects our lives at so many points thatit must be related to a wide range of other policies and issues:-   TRANSPORT AND EMPLOYMENT   Housing, employment and transport are closely interconnected. Decisions on the location ofnew housing can have important implications for employment,and vice versa. Decisions on changes in transport facilitiescan affect housing and jobs. And in a period of rapid industrialchange, the ease with which a worker can move house will assume increasing importance.* &quot;Local authority&quot; is the term used in the Green Paper to describe localhousing authorities.(confidential)
(confide ntTal)- PLANNING AND THE ENVIRONMENT   Housing is a crucial factor in the changing form of towns. The planning system - includingthe Community Land Act - is closely concerned with theprovision and availability of land for housing development,and there is an interaction between the planning system,and housing policies, which influence the amount of new land required.- INNER URBAN AREAS   Many strands of policy come together inthe consideration of the future of inner urban areas. these areas are not alone in having bad housing conditions. Butthe concentrations of such conditions in the innerurban areas are often associated with other severe social problems, especially poverty and unemployment. Wholesaledemolition of older housing, accompanied by the disruptionof existing communities and loss of jobs, has not helped.An effective housing policy can play a central part in theregeneration of these areas.- THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY   New housebuilding is a large part of the workload of the construction industry. Housingpolicies which too often change direction and are not designedto secure a reasonably stable level of demand for new houses are harmful to the efficiency of the industry andits suppliers, and lead to higher costs for the whole community.- SOCIAL WELFARE   Housing policy cannot on its own dealwith the special problems - for example low income, andinfirmity - which make it difficult for some people to fend for themselves. But housing policy must take accountof the special needs of the elderly, the disabled andexposed groups such as the homeless. Poverty and otherdisadvantages must not be allowed to condemn people tobad housing.1.5   We must do our best to ensure that any new policy for housing works with and not across the grain of the Government^ industrial, economic andother policies; and that it is internally coherent. This is easier saidthan done. For this reason, housing policy must be flexible enough to accommodatenew and unexpected circumstances.(confidential)
(confidentialtCHAPTER 2:     THE OBJECTIVES OF HOUSING policy .01     Some people consider that the housing situation today is paradoxical&apos;We have more and better houses* in relation to the number of householdsthan ever before. Yet housing problems persist.2.02     The explanation of the paradox may lie in the widening gap betweenthe majority living in housing of good standard and the substantial butdiminishing number living in poor conditions; and in the fact that the inflation of recent years resulted in increases in householders&apos; payments in line with or faster than prices - though not normally as much as earning- despite big increases in general assistance.**THE PRESENT situation.03     Part II of the Green Paper (chapters 3 to 5) examines the main features of the present housing situation and the effects of the financialstrains of the last few years, and considers the arguments for and again9radical change in the current basis of pricing and general assistance.The next three sections of this chapter summarise the main conclusions reached in Part II, which provide the essential background to the Govern111611housing objectives.i.     Housing Conditions2.OA     In 1951, there were about 10M households in England and Walesfamilies with children, childless couples, and single people - living in physically unsatisfactory conditions or sharing accommodation. By 1^^the figure had fallen to about 2.8M. These figures are a cause for bothsatisfaction and concern: satisfaction that so much has been done; conethat much remains to be done. The continuing improvement in standards      ^of housing nationally is no consolation to people who remain in poorOn the contrary, their problems are thrown into sharp relief.* &quot;House&quot; is the term used throughout the Green Paper for all types ofViouSe9&apos;accommodation except where a distinction is explicitly made between &quot;flats etc.** &quot;General assistance&quot; is the term used in the Green Paper to describe-tax relief on mortgage interest or option mortgage subsidy for house PExchequer housing subsidies to the public sector which are not directly related to tenants&apos; incomes; and General Rate Fund contributions to loC.... . t- rebateauthorities&apos; Housing Revenue Accounts. It is not used to cover rentfor public sector tenants; or rent allowances for private tenants.6(confidential)
(confidential)2.05     The single national figure of 2.8M conceals almost as much as itreveals. It undoubtedly includes substantial numbers of households living in circumstances which most people would not accept for their own families.This may apply to not less than one household in ten.2.06     National figures cover a wide spectrum, ranging from householdsliving in houses which are seriously substandard or crowded to householdswho are willingly sharing accommoodation of a good standard. They excludemany houses in a serious state of disrepair and households living in physicallysound housing unsuited to their needs, such as families with small childrenliving in flats above ground level. And they do not reveal that some people have been left behind by the general improvement in housing standards,especially in declining inner city areas where there are concentrations of run down housing and the problems are compounded by other social andeconomic difficulties.2.07     If present trends continue there will be substantial further progressin dealing with the backlog of bad housing conditions as well as providingfor new households. Projections* made for the Review show how this could come about. But these projections are not firm forecasts; they cannottake account of important and unpredictable changes that might occur.Furthermore, national projections of current trends   tell us little aboutthe right balance to be struck between the provision of new housing andthe improvement of existing housing, about how particular groups willfare, or what progress will be made in areas with the most difficult housingproblems.2.08    We can only establish precisely how much needs to be done, where,and when, by local assessment. But clearly rehabilitation and repair,and better management and use of the housing stock, will often be just as important as new housebuilding in dealing with bad housing conditions and providing for new households.2.09     Special issues affecting the continuing contraction of the privaterented sector will be further considered in the Review of the Rent Acts.*   Technical Volume I, Chapter 3.
(confidentialii.   Housing Finance2.10     In recent years, big and rapid increases in house and land prices,construction costs, and interest rates subjected the financing of housingto unprecedented strains. The house price explosion of 1971-73 pulledlocal authority tender prices up with it. An important contributory factorwas the scale of lending by the building societies (and other lending agenciesincluding secondary banks). Price increases were followed by very large increases in interest rates needed to get domestic credit back under control&apos;The supply of mortgage finance swung sharply and therefore the level of investment in housing in the private sector was severely disrupted. NevertheleSinvestment in the construction and improvement of housing in the public sector rose.2.11     The impact of rising costs on public sector tenants and mortgagorswas moderated by substantial increases in general assistance, which grewmuch faster than investment. Consequently, over the period 1971/72 to1975/76 rents paid by public sector tenants and the periodic payments by home-owners rose on average at about the same rate as prices generally.But there were periods when in both main sectors average payments increasedmore than prices, and even exceeded increases in earnings. Home-owners&apos;payments increased substantially more than average earnings between 1972and 1974. Unrebated local authority rents moved ahead of average earningsfor a short period in 1973/74.2.12     A large part of the increase in housing costs in recent years result^from successive rises in interest rates. If interest rates were to stabil3-86or fall, less general assistance would be required. But the events ofthe first half of the nineteen seventies underline the need to developarrangements which will minimise the disruptive effects on housing of short term changes in the economic and financial climate.iii.    Pricing and Assistance: Alternative Approaches2.13     The question of the price people should pay for housing cannotbe settled by a simple formula. Many young families opt to become homeowners although - even with the help of mortgage tax relief* - they mayinitially have to devote more than a fifth of their net income to mortgagepayments. On the other hand the poorest families can afford little fortheir housing.* &quot;Mortgage tax relief&quot; includes option mortgage subsidy unless otherwisestated.8(confidential^
(confidential)2.14     The Government have considered various alternatives to the present arrangements for the pricing of housing and general assistance, such asthe introduction of pricing related to current values in the owner-occupiedand public rented sectors, the elimination or substantial reduction ofgeneral assistance, and a &quot;universal housing allowance&quot;. But the price and supply of housing are related. Any change which would substantiallyraise the cost of housing in relation to prices and incomes generallymust be carefully weighed against the probability that it would lead toa large reduction in housing investment. And the decisions and familybudgets of millions of households have been shaped by the expectation that existing arrangements will continue in broadly their present form.2.15     The present basis of pricing and general assistance can be criticised as tending to encourage excessive consumption of housing. But the case for alternative arrangements must be weighed against the diversion ofsome expenditure currently devoted to housing into other channels andthe need for wider use of income-related assistance and very complex adminis-trative machinery. Over the years the view has been held that the well-being of present and future generations is better safeguarded if housing isnot left solely to market forces. The Government believe that this remainsa wise judgement, and that it is right to maintainthe present system of pricing in the owner-occupied and publicrented sectors, based on costs actually incurred*, not hypotheticalcurrent values;-   rent rebates and rent allowances for tenants with lower incomes;general assistance with housing costs in the owner-occupiedand public rented sectors, subject to certain changes designedto secure its more effective and fairer use.HOUSING OBJECTIVES2.16     The Government believe that the objectives of housing policy mustbe rooted in the traditions and reasonable expectations of the nation,but must also reflect present realities. In the light of the conclusions* Public sector authorities charge rents related to the aggregate &quot;historic&quot;construction costs or purchase price of all houses in their stock. Home-owners&apos;regular payments are related to the price they originally paid for theirhouse (which for any second-hand house is likely to be above the &quot;historic&quot;cost paid by the first occupier of the house).(confidential)9
(confidentialon the present housing situation, the Government propose that policy for housing over the next decade should be directed towards the followingobjectives:i.     The traditional aim of a decent home for all families at aprice within their means must remain our primary objective.Many families are still living in unsatisfactory housing conditions. But we should no longer think about this onlyin terms of national averages. This may have made sense when there was an overwhelming absolute shortage of housingeverywhere. It makes sense no longer. On the contrary, anational approach can draw attention and resources away from the areas with the most pressing needs.ii. We must try to secure the optimum balance between investment in new houses and the improvement of older houses, withregard to the needs of the individual and the community,as well as to cost.iii. Housing costs should be a reasonably stable element in family finances. There are about 20M householdersin Great Britain - home-owners and tenants. A majoritymake rent or mortgage repayments. They have shaped theirhousehold budgets around certain broad expectations abouthousing costs. They should not have to face sharp anddisruptive increases in costs totally disproportionate to changes in their ability to pay.iv.   We must ensure that the special housing needs of groupssuch as the elderly and disabled are met.We must secure a reasonable degree of priority in access to public rented sector housing and home-ownership for people in housing need who in the past have found themselves at the end of the queue. This includes for example somelone-parent families, and middle-aged single people withmodest incomes. They must not be left out in the cold.v.fconfidential&quot;)
(confide ntjal)vi. We must increase the scope for mobility in housing. Itis essential, in a period of rapid industrial change, thatworkers should be able to move house when they want to change their job.vii. We must make it easier for people to obtain the tenurethey want. More and more people would like to become homeowners, or to enter the newer forms of tenure combiningsome of the advantages of home ownership and renting. Weshould not let our proper first concern for those whoare badly housed lead us to overlook the reasonable housingambitions of the community in general. As conditions ease,families should be able to look forward to wideningopportunities for themselves, and for their children asthey grow up.viii. We must safeguard the independence of tenants. All familieshave a right to expect a reasonable degree of freedom from interference in the way they use their homes.2.17     The main elements of a policy designed to achieve the Governmentshousing objectives can be briefly summarised - at the risk of some over-simpli-fication - in terms of the supply and use of housing.2.18     The Government consider that to secure an adequate supply of housingof acceptable standards at a price within the reach of all families, housinginvestment must continue to be supported by general assistance, used ina better and more efficient way. Public sector housing investment mustbe directed more selectively. This applies to the place, the timing andthe type of investment. We can achieve this through housing strategiesdeveloped locally within the framework of a national housing policy. Suchlocal housing strategies- will enable investment to be channelled in such a way that better progress is made in dealing with the needs of the most vulnerable households and the worst concentrations of badhousing, especially in the inner cities; and
(confidential)- will reinforce the trend towards gradual renewal by a carefulcombination of renovation and rebuilding which reflects theneeds and wishes of individuals.2.19     The other side of the coin is the use of housing. This is closelybound up with tenure. People should have a reasonable chance of getting the kind of home they want. This will involve widening the way into home-ownership, developing further new forms of tenure such as co-ownership and equity sharing, and making it easier for people to move house andto change their form of tenure if they wish. We also need to develop a charter for tenants to strengthen their rights and freedoms.2.20     Part II of the Green Paper (chapters 3 to 5) gives a fuller descripti0of the main features of the housing situation summarised above - housing conditions, tenure, finance, and alternative approaches to pricing and assistance.   Part III of the Green Paper discusses the Governments specif10proposals for a national housing policy. The first chapter in Part III- Chapter 6 - provides a general survey of the policy. The remaining chaptersdiscuss in detail specific proposals on the supply of housing in the owneroccupied, private rented, and public rented sectors; on improvement policy;on the use of housing in relation to the needs of individual households;and the special problems of the inner urban areas and Greater London.
(confidential)PART IIWHERE WE ARE NOWCHAPTER 3THE PRESENT SITUATION - HOUSING CONDITIONS AND TENURE3.01   Housing in England and Wales appears to compare reasonably wellin terms of basic amenities and space with countries in both Western europe and North America. We have a larger and better quality housing stock than ever before. Nevertheless - and despite a sharp rise in total housing expenditure in recent years - housing is sometimes discussed as thoughlittle has been achieved and things are getting worse. Why is this?3.02   To understand the present situation better, we need to look at:- the size and quality of the housing stock in relation tothe households to be accommodated;- the effect of changes in housing tenure; and- the financial system.The first two of these are considered in this chapter, and finance inthe next chapter. There is additional statistical material in Annex B.3.03   A word of caution is necessary about what follows. Even a simpledescription of the housing situation is not straightforward. We are betterinformed than ever before, but we still do not have all the informationwe need. We now have up-to-date information on the condition of the housingstock from the House Condition Survey 1976. But information on householdsand tenure is still based on the Census of 1971. We know that importantchanges have taken place since then but we can only make estimates ofsome of them. We need better and up-to-date information on such matters as the rate of household formation, changes in household composition,changes in the number of households sharing, vacant houses, and the composition and distribution of the private rented sector. We also need better information about differences between housing conditions in different areas. /Moreup-to-date and comprehensive information will be obtained from a new NationalHousing Survey which will be launched later this year; and the Departmentof the Environment intend to establish a special Unit to analyse information about housing and to monitor progress.7
(confidential)THE HOUSING STOCK3.04   For most of this century the dominant problem has been the sheershortage of houses in relation to the number of families. For ten years in the first half of the century we were at war. In those years few houses were built and nearly a quarter of a million houses were destroyed. Witha swiftly rising number of households the pressing need until very recentlywas for more houses of most kinds nearly everywhere. The problem of nationalhousing shortage was aggravated by the inheritance from before the first world War of a large number of houses built to standards far below what are now acceptable - about 25% of the present housing stock in Englandand Wales was built between 1871 and 1914.3.05   In the last 25 years housing conditions nationally have been transformThere is no longer an absolute national shortage of houses. Whereas in1951 there were about 850,000 more households than houses in England andWales, by 1976 there were about 500,000 more houses than households (seeFigure 1).Figure 1: National balance (England and Wales) of dwellings and households1951 - 1976
(confidential)3.06     The fact that we now have more housing than households does not mean that all housing problems have been solved. There were about 400,000vacant fit houses in England and Wales in 1971; but we have to allow fora substantial number of houses which are bound to be vacant at any pointin time for a variety of reasons - such as houses awaiting demolitionor under repair; houses temporarily vacant while families are moving;second homes; and surplus houses in areas of declining population. Andwe have to take account not only of the numbers of houses, but also ofthe housing conditions of the families living in them.3.07   Housing conditions too have improved strikingly over the last 25years. In 1951 there were about 10M households in England and Wales living in unfit houses*, in substandard houses**, in overcrowded conditions***,or sharing a house with other households. The comparable figure for 1976was about 2.8M (see Figure 2).FIGURE 2Estimate of households in unsatisfactory physical conditions,overcrowded or in shared accommodation(England and Wales; thousands)1951 1976Households in unsatisfactoryphysical conditions:in unfit houses )                           700ain substandard houses ) ^*750             l,000aHouseholds overcrowded 650                150Households sharing (voluntarily 2,650              1,000and involuntarily)Totals 10,200              2,800a.

(confidential)Over the last 5 years it is estimated that the number of unfit houseshas been reduced by some 350,000 - about half by demolition and half byimprovement - some 800,000 substandard houses have been improved, overcrowdinghas fallen by a third and sharing by a fifth.3.08   These national statistics do not however tell the whole story aboutthe remaining backlog of inadequate housing. They exclude houses whichare technically neither unfit nor substandard, but are in serious disrepair- between 50,000 and 70,000 houses became unfit each year between 1971and 1976. They take no account of families living in housing of good standard,but unsuited to their needs - for example families with small children in high-rise blocks, and elderly or disabled people struggling with housesill-adapted to their special problems. Broad-brush categorisations of unsatisfactory housing also fail to take account of the wide variations in the intensity of problems within the categories set out in paragraph3.07:- There are about 900,000 unfit houses in England and Wales,700,000 of which are occupied. A large number will have tobe replaced. But it may make better sense both financiallyand socially to rehabilitate many of them.- The remaining &quot;substandard&quot; houses cover a wide range of physicalconditions. Many lack several important amenities and will need a good deal of work and expenditure on rehabilitation.At the other extreme some lack only one minor amenity and could be brought up to standard by relatively simple andinexpensive works.- There are even greater variations among &quot;sharing&quot; households.These include not only families with children and childlesscouples but also middle-aged single people - unmarried, widowedor divorced - and young single people. Some of these householdswill be sharing involuntarily; some will be living in difficultdomestic circumstances. But others may not regard their housing conditions as in any sense unsatisfactory.- National figures conceal wide variations in the seriousness of local problems. We do not have consistent and up-to-datestatistics for all the individual local authorities, but we know that in some areas there is virtually no deficit of decenthousing, while other areas have intense concentrations of badhousing, often associated with other social problems, which16(confidential)
(confidential)contribute to a downward spiral of neglect and decay.Poor housing is one of the most obvious symptoms of the collective deprivation suffered by people living in thefailing areas of many major cities, as is well illustratedin the recently published summary reports of the InnerArea Studies of London, Liverpool and Birmingham. in wales, there are 100,000 houses unfit - 10% of the totalWelsh housing stock.3.09   It is clear therefore that we over-simplify the problem if we speak of &quot;housing need&quot; as an absolute condition which can be measured precisely.The range and degree of need is very wide and difficult to gauge; butthere is without doubt a substantial number of households who are still very inadequately housed. This clearly applies to people living in unfithouses and in overcrowded conditions. It also applies to many of the householdsliving in substandard houses and some of those who are sharing. Probablyat least 1.8M households in England and Wales - more than one in ten -are living in circumstances which are just not acceptable by contemporarystandards. This is the hard core of housing need; and it shades into housing conditions which though less unsatisfactory are not good enough and oughtto be improved.3.10   We have to make provision for working through the backlog of inadequatehousing conditions; and to allow for replacement of houses which willbecome unfit even if more improvement and repair is undertaken, and forfit houses which are unavoidably demolished for one reason or another.We also have to provide for the growth in household numbers. The projectedaverage rate of net new household formation* in England and Wales in thenext ten years is 135,000 a year. This arises partly from growth in theproportion of the population of marriageable age, and partly from an increasein the number of people - particularly the elderly - living as one-personhouseholds. The projection is based on past trends, but the future rateof net household formation will of course depend in part on the supplyof houses and their prices or rents.3.11 This description suggests that although there has been a great improvementin housing conditions in England and Wales, many households* The rate at which the formation of new households is expected to exceed the dissolution of existing households.(confidential)
(confidential)are still living in unfit or substandard houses, or are overcrowded orsharing involuntarily. Others are living in houses which are in a poorstate of repair, or which though physically adequate are unsuitable.National statistics do not tell us all we need to know about the size,range and distribution of housing needs. A substantial level of new house-building will be necessary to cope with the increase in the numbers of households, to meet the needs of some households who are currently sharinginvoluntarily or who are overcrowded, and to replace houses which haveto be demolished. But much can be done by rehabilitation, conversionand repair of existing houses and by better use of the existing stock.CHANGES IN THE TENURE BALANCE3.12   The ability to get a decent home depends not only on the supplyof housing, but on the factors, different in each tenure, which determineaccess to housing.3.13   One of the major social changes of our time has been the shiftin the structure of housing tenure - the rise of home ownership and publlCsector renting, and the decline of private renting. At the end of theFirst World War probably 90% of the housing stock was rented privately-and virtually the whole of the remainder was owner-occupied. Now, inEngland and Wales about 55% of houses are owner-occupied, 30% are inthe public sector, and only 15% are rented privately (see Figure 3).Figure 3: Housing tenure in 1951,, 1971 and 1976 (England and Wales),52%12.5M  dwellings0 w r \ g r - 0 c c u p! e d17.0M dwellings18.1 M  dwelling3Private rentedisi-iS   Public sector (local authority, new town, and housing associati0^(confidential)
(confidential)3.14   The reasons for the changes in the size of the three tenures arecomplex. There have been powerful social and financial influences operatingboth on the demand for houses in different tenures and on the supply.3.15   Non-financial considerations may have played a large part in thegrowth of the owner occupied and public rented sectors. Home owners are strongly attracted by the opportunity for personal freedom and independence.Most tenants prefer a socially accountable public landlord to a privatelandlord. But in addition, general assistance has made these tenuresmore attractive to many households than renting from a private landlord.Even in the absence of rent control and regulation, competition fromthe sectors aided by general assistance would have made it difficult forlandlords to get a commercially attractive return on new houses and flats.These and other factors often make sale for home ownership more attractive,although many landlords continue to relet.3.16   It is difficult to envisage a reversal of the contraction of theprivate rented sector. But there are about 7M people still living in privaterented accommodation, and so the private rented sector will be of greatimportance for many years to come. This is why the Government have begunthe Review of the Rent Acts, mentioned in the Introductory Note.3.17   The Review of the Rent Acts will not be completed until later thisyear. But it is already clear that the continuing contraction of the privaterented sector can cause problems for some people who for one reason or another tend to come at the end of the queue for home ownership or public sector renting. This is particularly evident in the inner cities, whereprivate lettings often make up an important part of the housing stock.Such people may be:- mobile workers - including immigrant families - newly arrived in the locality who may not be able to get a mortgage and insome areas do not qualify by residence for local authority housing;- one-parent families, many of whom face similar difficulties as a result of moving home after marital breakup and stayingtemporarily with relatives;- newly married couples, who may face a long period of savingbefore they can hope to afford home ownership, and without children do not stand much chance of getting a local authorityhouse;(confide NfJAT)19

(confidential)CHAPTER 4:     THE PRESENT SITUATION - HOUSING finance.01     Total private and public investmknt in housing in the United Kingdom*grew for most of the post-war period, both in absolute terms and as a proportionof the Gross Domestic Product. At the start of the nineteen seventies itwas only about  3,900M compared with nearly  4,400M in 1968/69; but itrose to  4.500M in 1972/73 and to  5.500M in 1973/74, and stayed aroundthis level in 1974/75 and in 1975/76 (1976 prices). But since the early1970s there has been a disconcerting shift in the pattern of expenditure.General assistance and rent rebates have risen at a much faster rate thaninvestment- 124% since 1969/70 as opposed to 35% for investment (seeFigure 4.) Nevertheless, rents and net mortgage payments have also continuedto rise.INVESTMENT, SUBSIDY, AND HOUSEHOLDERS&apos; PAYMENTS4.02     The cost of housing depends on the price of land and the capital cost of new building and improvement. Demand for housing is affected byincome levels, the cost of borrowing, and the net costs which householdershave to meet themselves in the form of rents or mortgage payments net of tax relief. The picture is further complicated because local authorities&apos;decisions on housing investment depend on social as well as financialfactors; and effective demand for home ownership can be limited by the availability of mortgage funds. But although there is no straightforwardrelationship between costs, incomes, assistance and investment, highernet costs to householders will tend to lead to lower levels of investment in new housing and vice versa.4.03     The annual borrowing costs on a house depend primarily on the &quot;historic&apos;cost - the price paid by the current owner, whether a home owner or alocal authority. The average capital debt is currently  4,000 for eachmortgaged house, and between  2,500 and  3,000 for each public sectorhouse. Because of the large amount of debt, housing costs are cruciallyaffected by interest rates. Interest charges make up about two thirds of housing costs.* The figures for investment throughout this section are for the UnitedKingdom - disaggregated figures for the owner-occupied sector in Englandand Wales are not available.(confidential)

(confidential)A.04     General assistance meets a proportion of borrowing costs. If borrowingcosts rise - either because land and building costs or house prices go up, or because of increases in interest rates - then there is an increasein both householders&apos; net payments and general assistance. The effectsare different for new investment and the outstanding debt on existing houses, since the latter is affected only by interest rate increases.4.05     Increases in prices and interest rates affect householders&apos; paymentsdifferently in the two main sectors because of fundamental differences in their financial arrangements.4.06     In the owner occupied sector the effect depends upon the positionof the individual householder - whether he owns his house outright, hasa mortgage outstanding, or is just becoming a home owner. If he owns his house outright he will be unaffected. If he still has a mortgage, hiscosts will rise with increases in interest rates by an amount depending on how large a loan he has outstanding. But if he is taking out a newmortgage - either because he is buying a more expensive house or, moreimportantly, because he is a first-time purchaser - his payments willbe increased both by higher interest rates and by higher market prices for houses.4.07 In the local authority sector, there are arrangements which spread the impact of cost and interest rate increases:i.     Local authorities &quot;pool&quot; rent income. Where the loan charges and running costs on, for example, a pre-war house are very low,the authority may charge a rent which produces a surplus on that particular house, and use the surplus to help meet the highercosts of more recent houses. By &quot;pooling&quot; rent income in thisway, local authorities can undertake new development and spread the high costs across the whole of their stock, though they maybe influenced by how far they consider it socially acceptable to raise rents on older housing to help sustain their investment programme.(confidential)
(confidential)ii.   A local authority borrows for capital expenditure on housingfrom its &quot;consolidated loans fund&quot;. This fund is financed in turn by borrowing for a mixture of short and longer-term periodsfrom a variety of external sources. The interest charged to theHousing Revenue Account (HRA) is at the average &quot;pooled&quot; interestrate on the various borrowings which make up the consolidatedloans fund. Averaging has the effect of &quot;damping down&quot; movements in interest rates, making the rate charged to the HRA slowerto rise and slower to fall than market rates.4.08     Over time - particularly in periods of inflation - the loan charges in both main sectors based on the &quot;historic&quot; cost or purchase price ofa house tend to fall in relation to householders&apos; current incomes.4.09     The common form of home owner&apos;s mortgage - the annuity mortgage- involves payments of the same sum each year. The annuity payment ismade up of a capital repayment and interest payable on the outstandingcapital debt. The initial annuity payments are largely interest, but overthe life of the loan the proportions change so that by the end of theloan period the payments are made up largely of capital. The total annual payment - repayments of capital plus interest - is fixed when the mortgageis taken out and alters subsequently only if the interest rate changes.If incomes rise in money terms and interest rates do not increase, theburden of payments reduces in real terms over the years. When interest rates are high and money incomes are rising swiftly, a large proportionof the cost of the mortgage in real terms is concentrated in the early years. This is known as &quot;front loading&quot; (See Figure 5).
(confidential)Figure 5: Gross annuity payments as a proportion of gross income ona loan of 2\ times average earnings at a rate of interest 3% greaterthan the rate of increase in money incomes.4.10     The pattern is similar for a local authority&apos;s loan charges on its existing housing. There are differences due for example to refinancingof existing debt. But in periods of stable or falling interest rates theloan charges arising from existing housing tend to fall over time in relationto tenants&apos; incomes - though rent payments may continue to rise, chieflyas a result of rent pooling to help meet the higher costs of additionalnew investment.COST INCREASES IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES4.11     Interest rates and the rate of inflation were much lower in the1950s and 1960s than in recent years. Consequently &quot;front loading&quot; - the concentration of the real costs in the early part of the life of a housingloan - was of relatively little significance. Housing costs, earnings, netpayments for housing, and housing assistance moved ahead broadly in step,and the amount of general assistance needed to maintain a given relationship between the net annual cost of new housing and the general lev^l of incomeswas much less than in recent years.(confidential)25
(confidential)But by the late nineteen sixties the rise in the initial annual costs ofnew houses was enough to cause concern. It resulted in a shift in the housing subsidies Act 1967 from a subsidy in the traditional form of a fixed annualsum per house to a percentage subsidy related to capital costs and interest rates. And the early nineteen seventies witnessed a marked change.4.12     In the early nineteen seventies there were unprecedented increases in interest rates and capital costs:- rises in interest rates   The average local authority &quot;pool&quot; raterose only from 5.6% to 6.7% between 1967/68 and 1972/73; butbetween 1972/73 and 1974/75 it jumped from 6.7% to 9.6% - anincrease of 40% in two years. Similarly, the typical mortgagerate rose from 7i% in 1967/68 to 8i% in 1972/73; but climbedto 11% by 1974/75 - an increase of 30% in two years.- increases in prices and capital costs   House prices and tendercosts rose by about 90% between 1971/72 and 1974/75 as comparedwith 35% in the previous four years. Land prices, rising evenmore steeply, increased by 160% as against 80% in the previousfour years (see Figure 6).4.13     With higher interest rates and a faster growth of money incomesthan in the nineteen sixties, front loading became an important factor.4.14     The initial effect of front loading is felt through the impact of higher interest rates. The succession of interest rate increases inthe early nineteen seventies forced up the cost of new and existing housing in both sectors in relation to average incomes. New housing investment,which was affected both by higher interest rates and higher capital costs,was hardest hit. The average annual gross charges on a new house in thepublic sector rose from about 20% of average earnings in 1970 to about37% in 1976, and there was a similar though smaller increase for private sector new housing. The increased borrowing costs for both new and existinghousing and the higher capital costs of new investment led to rises inhouseholders&apos; payments and increases in general assistance (see paragraph4.04 above).(confide ntjal)

(confidential)4.15 But once interest rates stabilise, front loading leads to a reductionin the real costs of existing housing as householders&apos; money incomes risein relation to outstanding housing debt. This &quot;catching up&quot; is delayedif new investment constantly adds to the total amount of outstanding debt.But in both main sectors the gap which opened up between average housingcosts and earnings in the early nineteen seventies has begun to narrow.HOME OWNERSHIP:  (i)    HOME-OWNERS&apos; PAYMENTS4.16     Despite the availability of mortgage tax relief, the net cost ofhome-ownership rose sharply in the early nineteen seventies. Between 1971/72and 1975/76 the average costs per owner occupied dwelling (mortgage payments,maintenance and other costs) rose by 87%, and net payments after tax reliefby 73%. This was roughly in line with the general increase in prices but less than the increase in earnings - over the same period the Retail price index (RPI) went up by 75% and average earnings (before tax) by 95%. Butbetween 1972 and 1974 net payments had risen substantially more than bothprices and earnings (see Figure 7).4.17     The amount of mortgage tax relief - which in the normal case meetsabout one third of gross mortgage interest - grew sharply both becauseof the rise in house prices and interest rates, and because of the growth in home ownership. It increased from around  635M in 1971-72 to  1,100Min 1975-76 (UK - 1976 prices). Other less important factors were the risein the basic rate of tax from 30% in 1973-74 to 33% in 1974-75 and 35%in 1975-76 which increased the amount of tax relief; and on the otherhand the introduction in 1974-75 of the limitation on borrowing eligiblefor tax relief to  25,000 on the owner&apos;s principal residence. The increasein mortgage tax relief meant that the proportion of total gross annualoutgoings met by home owners fell from 84% in 1971/72 to 78% in 1975/76.4.18     With higher prices and interest rates, first time home buyers commonlyhad to set aside more than 20% of post-tax income to meet initial mortgagepayments. Nevertheless, the strong preference for home-ownership was evidentin the fact that in general the demand for mortgages continued to exceed the supply.

(confidential)HOME-OWNERSHIP (ii) INVESTMENT4.19     The level of housing investment in the owner occupied sector rosein the early nineteen seventies to about  3.000M in 1973/74. It fell subsequentlynot so much because of any sustained reduction in demand - despite increases in house prices and interest rates - but because of a sharp drop in the supplyof mortgage funds at the end of 1973 and the beginning of 1974.4.20     Building Societies&apos; mortgage lending, and hence the receipts frominvestors needed to finance it, have grown rapidly and will continue todo so. The past growth is illustrated in Figure 8. The growth comes inpart from the continuing net additions to the owner-occupied stock from new building and purchases of formerly rented houses. But the gross demandfor mortgage funds will also reflect the extent to which houses formerlyowned outright, eg by elderly home-owners, are sold to new purchasersfinancing the sale by mortgages, and the increasing number of second handhouses changing hands as the owner-occupied housing stock grows (althoughto a considerable extent such purchases can be financed out of capitalreceipts from sales). Furthermore, the amount of funds needed for these purposes will continue to be affected for some years by the exceptionalsurge in house prices between 1971 and 1974, as mortgages of amounts thatreflect today&apos;s house prices replace mortgages taken out either before or at the beginning of the surge in house prices.4.21     But building societies&apos; receipts from investors - especially thosein larger amounts such as  2,000 and upwards - have proved very sensitiveto changes in the balance between the interest rate offered by societies and those offered by their competitors. These competing rates, perhapsespecially those offered by banks for large deposits, have been subject in the 1970s to changes of as much as 4% in three months - more severethan anything seen in the 1950s and 1960s. Consequently, building societiesreceipts have fluctuated by large amounts, for example from an averageof  366M a month in February-March 1975 to  25M a month in November-December.4.22     Before the present stabilisation arrangements - discussed in Chapter7 - were introduced, the large variations in building society receiptsresulted in alternating mortgage &quot;feasts and famines&apos;  (see Figure 8).(confidential)
(confidential)Figure 8: Building Societies&apos; net receipts, mortgage lending and housingstarts, 1961 - 1976 (UK)(confidential)
(confidential)When interest rates fell, money poured into building societies. The lendingon mortgage   of this influx of funds contributed to the surge in houseprices. The period of severe mortgage rationing in 1973-74 - which endedmore quickly than it would otherwise have done after the Government&apos;sprovision of  500M in short term loans - led to a halving within a year of the houses started for sale. The number of private sector housing startsin England and Wales fell from about 200,000 in 1973 to about 96,000in 1974; there was then some recovery and about 132,000 houses were started in 1975 and 138,000 in 1976.PUBLIC RENTED SECTOR (i)    RENTS4.23     The increase in capital costs and interest rates - together with higher costs of management and supervision - resulted in an increase in local authority HRA costs averaging 116% per dwelling between 1971/72and 1975/76. Over the same period unrebated rents went up by 76%. Thiswas about the same as the RPI (75%) but less than average earnings (95%).Rebated rents went up by 44% (Figure 9).4.24     Despite rent increases, the proportion of sharply rising totalHRA costs met by unrebated rents fell from 77% in 1972/73 to 57% in 1975/76.Subsidies bridged the gap: in the most difficult years, rent increasescovered only one quarter of the cost increases. Exchequer general subsidiesrose automatically as costs increased. There was also a change in thesystem of subsidies, when the system set up under the Housing finance act 19 72 was replaced by the interim arrangements in the Housing rents and Subsidies Act 1975. This Act consolidated previously existing subsidiesat the level they had reached in 1974-75 and provided new elements of subsidy related to the costs of new investment, increases in the costof servicing &quot;old&quot; debt, and especially high HRA costs. In addition, extrasubsidies were paid to enable rents to be held down as part of counter-inflapolicy in 1974/75 and 1975/76. Exchequer general subsidies rose from  361Min 1971/72 to  715M in 1975/76. General Rate Fund contributions to HPAsrose from  77M in 1971/72 to  198M in 1975/76 (1976 prices - England andWales).(confidential)

(confidential)4.25     Rent rebate schemes, which were made mandatory in 1972, protectlower-income tenants from the full impact of rent increases. Currently75% of the cost is met by the Exchequer and the remainder from the authority&apos;general Rate Fund. The sum spent on rent rebates rose from about  25Min 1971/72 to  252M in 1975/76 (1976 prices - England and Wales). allowing for rebates the proportion of costs met by rents in 1975-76 was 40%.4.26     In total, Exchequer general subsidies, rate fund contributions,and rent rebates rose from  635M in 1971/72 to  1.495M in 1975/76 (1976prices - England and Wales).PUBLIC RENTED SECTOR (II)      INVESTMENT4.27     Public sector investment in the UK declined steadily in the early1970s, from  1.930M in 1969/70 to  1.690M in 1971/72. It rose in 1972/73to  1,955M. Since then it has been substantially higher, averaging  2,820Min the last three years. The higher levels of investment in these later years offset to some extent the fall in private sector investment fromits &quot;boom&quot; peak of 1973/74. Public sector housing starts fell continuouslyin the late 1960s and early 1970s, but rose in the last three years,reaching 180,000 in 1976.4.28     Local authorities were able to achieve this level of investmentwithout making greatly increased demands on existing tenants - despitesharp increases in capital costs and interest rates - partly because of&quot;loans pooling&quot; and &quot;rent pooling&quot; (see paragraph 4.07 above) but chieflybecause of the increases in Exchequer subsidy and rent rebates described above. Some authorities benefited from their continuing entitlement tosubsidies originally provided under earlier provisions    (see paragraph4.24), even though their current HRA costs were not rising significantlyas they were not carrying out large programmes of new building or improvement&apos;*      *      *34(confidential)
(confidential)4.29     This discussion shows how the early nineteen seventies werecharacterised by unprecedneted increases in house prices, land prices,building costs and interest rates. These produced increases in currenthousing costs in both the owner-occupied sector and the public rentedsector which ran ahead of the general level of prices and earnings. Thenet payments of householders kept up with the general price level - at times even exceeding the rate of increase in earnings for short periods -but not with the gross increase in housing costs. The gap was bridgedby general assistance - and rent rebates - which grew sharply. If generalassistance had not risen as it did, total investment would probably havebeen lower.4.30     Because of the effect of &quot;front loading&quot;, if interest rates wereto stabilise even at a high level, then on present investment trends theamount of general assistance required to maintain on average a reasonablerelationship between housing payments and householders&apos; incomes would growonly slowly in real terms. Additional costs arising from new investment would be very largely offset by the fall in the real value of payments on existing housing debt. With falling interest rates, the amount of generalassistance required would decline in real terms.(confidential)
(confidential)CHAPTER 5:      PRICING AND ASSISTANCE: ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES5.01     As the previous chapter showed, increases in the cost of housing in the early 1970s led to rapid changes in householders&apos; outgoings. Someprivate and public sector tenants were protected against cost increasesby income-related rent allowances and rent rebates. Most tenants of privatelandlords (or housing associations) had the benefit of rent control orrent regulation, which limited the scope for landlords to pass on cost increases. And the effect of cost increases was cushioned to some extentfor public sector tenants and mortgagors by higher general assistance.5.02     But the rise in general assistance not directly related to householdersincomes - in 1976-77 it averaged about  4 per week for local authoritytenants and the same for mortgagors - has prompted questions about how much people pay directly for their housing, how much help they get fromthe Exchequer, and how much they pay indirectly through taxation.5.03     Under any financial arrangements for housing it is necessarv tokeep the level of assistance and its relation with housing costs, incomes,and householders outgoings under review. The level of general assistance is however a separate question from the basis of general assistance; and recent debate has in part focussed on the case for changing the whole basisof providing assistance with housing costs.5.04     Four main proposals for change in the current basis of pricing and assistance which have figured in public discussion are that:i. general assistance should be eliminated or substantially reduced and the rent rebate and rent allowance scheme extended;ii. general assistance should be replaced by a universal flat rate personal housing allowance;iii. the regular housing payments of all householders - whethertenants or home owners - should be related to the currentvalue of their housing, not to its historic cost, with theassistance of subsidies where necessary; oriv. general housing assistance should be retained, but shouldbe distributed more fairly and more effectively.36(confidential)
(confidential)5.05     Radical changes in long-established financial arrangements are nevereasy. They are bound to cause problems for households who have plannedtheir finances on the expectation that the current arrangements would continue.The question is whether the benefits of radical alternatives would sufficientlyoutweigh the advantages of the current forms of general assistance to justifythe disruption that might be caused, no matter how carefully new arrangements were introduced.ASSISTANCEGeneral assistance5.06 General assistance which meets some part of housing costs without regard to an individual householder1s ability to pay is available in one form or another in virtually all developed countries, although there arewide variations in its scope and scale.5.07     The annual cost of a new house has always been high in relationto average income - currently it is equal to about one-third of average earnings. By meeting a proportion of housing costs, general assistanceenables a larger number of households to afford houses built or improvedto acceptable contemporary standards without recourse to a universal formof assistance based on individual tests of income and family circumstances.It makes possible higher housing standards than would otherwise be attained.It enables the provision of houses of good standard to be maintained inthe face of increases in house prices and construction costs relative toincomes, and increases in interest rates.5.08     Recent sharp increases in general assistance were a response toan unprecedented rise in the cost of housing. Changes in financial systemscannot alter the harsh reality that if the cost of housing rises sharplyin relation to incomes, many people will be unwilling or unable to affordhousing at present standards unless extra assistance is provided, in one way or another, to help them meet the extra cost.5.09     But the way in which assistance is provided can have an influence on how much people spend on housing.(confidential^)
(confidential)5.10     General assistance is by its very nature not directly related toability to pay. Some householders therefore get more help than they strictly&quot;need&quot; to enable them to afford a home of a decent basic standard. Becauseof this, it is sometimes argued that general assistanceleads to over-investment in housing and wasteful use of thehousing stock, and creates unreasonable expectations and artificial shortages;enables land owners and owners of existing houses to chargehigher prices, although this is not readily quantifiable.Elimination or Substantial Reduction of General Assistance5.11     If general assistance were substantially reduced it would open theway to a substantial reduction in the burden of taxation. But on average,tenants in the public rented sector and home owners would pay more inextra charges for housing than they got back from tax reductions. Thereare some 6f;M tenants of local authorities and new towns in the United Kingdom,just under 6M home-owners with mortgages, and 4jM home owners owning outrightcompared with 20iM households in total. All households would benefit froma reduction in indirect taxes; and all except those with incomes too lowto incur tax liability would gain from reductions in income tax. Householdscurrently receiving general assistance which included two or more earnerswould be likely to gain more from a reduction in income tax than they lost in higher payments for housing. But those with one earner only - the majority- would be likely to lose. Those with unusually high outgoings, eg tenantsin high cost areas, or home owners with high percentage mortgages taken out only recently, would stand to lose most.5.12     A large reduction in general assistance would raise householders&apos;costs and so tend to reduce investment in housing. Less well-off householdersmight be safeguarded by adjustments to the rent rebate and rent allowanceschemes (and perhaps an extension of the scheme to home-owners). But tothe extent that lower income householders were protected against increasedhousing payments the net savings available for tax cuts would be reduced;and there would be much greater reliance on income-testing.(confidential)
(confidential)A Universal Housing Allowance5.13     An alternative approach which would avoid an extension of personalincome-tested assistance would be to abolish general assistance and replaceit with a &quot;universal housing allowance&quot;. This would take the form ofa regular flat-rate payment made to all beneficiaries for as long asthey remained householders. It would be large enough to enable the mosthard-pressed families to afford housing of a reasonable basic standard.But it would be subject to income tax - so that a proportion would be&quot;clawed back&quot; from the better-off by the workings of the tax system -and to this extent related to householders&apos; incomes. It would replaceboth general and income-related housing assistance.5.14     Such an arrangement raises serious practical problems:- it would be difficult to define eligibility in numerousborder-line cases - for example, would any single adultwho wished to live independently qualify, and would thosewho owned their homes outright, and no longer needed assistance,qualify too?- would recipients of the allowance be free to spend it on goods other than housing, accepting a lower standard of accommodation if they preferred to do so?the payment of a universal allowance, with income taxclawback, would involve a very large increase in the grossflow of payments in both directions; a clawback throughthe tax system would not secure full repayment from thosewho did not need assistance;a fixed sum providing adequate help to householders with heavy housing costs would be more than adequate for otherswith lower costs; but if set at a lower level it would be insufficient for the many households with higher thanaverage costs.The first two of these objections might be overcome, although only bycomplex administrative mechanisms. But the last two are more difficult,especially the variation in the level of housing payments.(confidential)39
(confidential.15     Housing costs vary widely, both over time and according to tenureand location. General assistance, which meets a proportion of borrowingcosts, tends to reduce these variations. For example, a new mortgagor&apos;sinitial mortgage payments consist almost entirely of interest which attractstax relief. The interest element in his payments, and tax relief on interest,gradually fall until, when he has paid off his mortgage, he gets nothing.In the local authority sector, authorities with large current investment programmes and high costs are subsidised more heavily than those with lowercosts.5.16     A flat rate allowance would not be able to cope with these differences in costs. If the allowance for all tenants and home owners had been introduced in 1975/76 at a level of, say,  280 a year - the basic rate tax relief on an average mortgage taken by first-time purchasers - the total cost would have been some  5,300M gross (before any tax claw-back). This is roughly twice the total amount of general assistance actually paid. even so, half a million mortgagors and at least as many local authority tenantswould have been worse off - even if none of the allowance had been clawedback through tax - unless income-tested subsidies had been provided aswell.5.17     Because of the problem of the wide variation in householders&apos; payments under present arrangements, the introduction of consistent pricing in allhousing sectors - based on current values - is sometimes seen as a necessaryprior step to the introduction of a universal housing allowance unrelatedto income or actual housing payments.PRICING5.18     As noted in Chapter 4, the borrowing costs on a house depend primarily on the &quot;historic&quot; cost - the price originally paid by the current owner.Over time, the historic cost diverges from the current value - sharplyin periods of high inflation - so that the borrowing costs on a house purchase&amp;esome years ago are a good deal lower than those of newly-purchased houses of similar quality.(confidential)
(confidential)5.19     For most goods the price paid reflects current value, or the incomederived from an asset - which is a measure of its current value - is taxed.But in both the main housing sectors, the divergence between the historiccost of a house and its current value is not taxed. The effects are different in the two main sectors. In the public sector, the benefits are &quot;pooled&quot;(see paragraph 4.7) leading to a lower average level of rents. Home ownersbenefit individually, and their payments start higher and tend to fallin real terms. The overall effect for both public sector tenants and home-ownersis that their regular payments for housing are generally lower in relationto the production cost of new houses than would be the case with most othergoods.5.20     Most tenants of private landlords and housing associations pay &quot;fairrents&quot;. These may be closer to current values, but local &quot;scarcity factors&quot;are excluded and the system of rent revisions means that &quot;fair rents&quot;tend to lag behind &quot;market&quot; rents, especially when increases are phasedover several years.5.21     The case against &quot;historic&quot; pricing is that it distorts the financial basis of choice. Because payments for housing are on average lower in relationto its current value than is the case with most other goods, people expectand get more, and a large share of resources goes to housing. The differentpatterns of payments in the two main sectors are difficult to compare.Mobility may be restricted in cases where the benefits of the divergence of historic cost and current values are reduced or lost to a householderif he moves.5.22     Current value pricing in the public rented sector would probablyinvolve assessing &quot;market&quot; rents by analogy with privately-rented dwellings.Such assessments would not be impossible but would be precarious since in many areas there are too few houses let at market-related rents to providea benchmark. In the owner-occupied sector, current-value pricing wouldprobably involve the taxation of notional income from &quot;beneficial occupation&quot;- an amount related to the difference between the price actually paid fora house and its current market value. Financial arrangements based on currentvalue pricing and a universal housing allowance would produce a closerrelationship than at present between assistance and personal circumstances,and provide a clearer basis for choice. But this has to be balanced against:(confidential)41
(confidential)The effects on housing investment.Prices based on higher current values - like substantial reductions in general assistance - would result in the diversion of some expenditure currently devoted to housinginto other channels. The housing allowance might be pitchedhigh enough to offset much of the price increase for themajority of householders. But this would be costly (seeparagraph 5.16); and the more subsidy was used to compensate for higher prices, the less would current value pricingachieve the objective of an allocation of resources to housingbased on willingness and ability to pay.- Upheaval in the household budgets of millions of families.Even if the total volume of assistance to householders remained the same, the distribution would be very different - for example,in the owner-occupied sector, older home owners with paid-upmortgages would be hardest hit by the introduction of a tax on the current value of their housing.- Pervasive and disruptive uncertainty for householders, localauthorities and house builders, which would arise from continuing doubt about the permanence of so radical a change.- The doubtful social justification for taxing housing in theowner-occupied sector, and treating it as a profit makingasset in the public sector.- The very heavy administrative costs and complications ofsuch arrangements.FAIRER AND MORE EFFECTIVE USE OF GENERAL ASSISTANCE5.23     The Government conclude that it would be better to retain the presstructure of pricing and general assistance rather than replace it withradically different arrangements. No system of housing finance is flawlesGeneral assistance has its imperfections. But its disadvantages can belessened if a sensible relationship is maintained between current housingcosts and householders&apos; incomes, and levels of assistance.
(confidential)Public sector subsidy5,24     There is a wide disparity in the level of housing costs falling on local authority HRAs, and consequently in the level of rents paid bytheir tenants. This is primarily because of differences in the age structure of a local authority&apos;s housing stock and capital debt, which is stronglyaffected by its current programme of investment in housing. For example,Stoke-on-Trent and Shrewsbury have a high proportion of older housing andhave carried out little new housing investment in recent years. Their averageHRA costs per dwelling were  251 pa and  298 pa respectively in 1975/76,and their average rents were  178 pa and  224 pa. On the other hand, Westminsterand Hammersmith have a high proportion of newer housing and have carriedout a good deal of new housebuilding in recent years. Their average HRAcosts per dwelling were  834 pa and  746 pa respectively in 1975/76, andtheir average rents were  362 pa and  291 pa. Disparities in rent levelsare accentuated by the fact that all local authorities, irrespective oftheir present circumstances, receive annual subsidies on a basis whichdoes not take full account of recent changes in prices, incomes and interest rates.5.25     The Government consider that there is a need for a new public sectorsubsidy system designed to achieve a more efficient and fairer use of subsidy.This could be done by reducing subsidy in areas of declining need in orderto concentrate it more on authorities with more pressing housing needswho will consequently have large investment programmes and rising costs.Home-ownership5.26     The Government do not consider that there is any case for modifying the provision of mortgage tax relief at the basic rate. Basic rate tax relief currently meets no more than about one-third of the interest charges on a mortgage. It provides a valuable form of assistance for the growing number of people who want to own their own home.5.27     /But those who get the greatest amount of help are those whose incomesare high enough to support very large mortgages or to entitle them to tax relief at the higher rates. This is difficult to reconcile with eitherefficiency or fairness. 7&quot; The Government therefore proposeto maintain a limit on the amount of a loan which canqualify for tax relief (currently  25,000);(confidential) 4?
44(confidential)Comp/-   to bring higher rate relief on mortgage interest to an end.(see paragraph 6.43 andarisons of assistance to home owners and council tenants5.28     A rigorous approach to comparisons of home owners and council tenantswould involve drawing up a &quot;balance sheet&quot; of actual and imputed costs and benefits of householders in the two sectors to establish a neutralposition from which the provision of assistance can be judged. But thereis no neutral position. Any comparison involves judgements about whetheror not to include in the balance sheet large and contentious items - forexample, the absence of a tax on &quot;notional income&quot; from home ownership,and the use of historic costs rather than market values in setting councilrents. There is no objective basis for deciding these questions*.5.29     Most of the recent debate on equity between the main sectors hascentred on a more limited question - whether the Government is providingbroadly the same help to both sectors in the form of mortgage tax relief and public sector general housing subsidies.5.30     But what is 1 the same&apos;? A higher level of assistance to local author^1in high cost areas faced with pressing housing needs can be justified on grounds of social policy. Nevertheless, comparisons are commonly made interms of the total amount of assistance to each sector or the amount ofassistance &apos;per head&apos;. The estimated figures for 1975/76 are:General Assistance^Numbers Amount Amount0^ ( M) per head2Local authority tenants(England and Wales)                     4.7 808  172All home-owners (UK)                    10.0 974   97All mortgagors (UK)                       5.9 974  165^ Includes rate fund contributions in the public rented sector.21.9M local authority tenants received an estimated  223M inrent rebates in 1975/6, an average of  118 per recipient.* This is discussed in Technical Volume I, Chapter 5.(confidential)
(confidential)5.31     Average figures are however of limited value. There are detailed problemsof comparison - for example, should all home-owners or only mortgagors beincluded? But there is a more fundamental weakness to this approach. Theamount of general assistance depends on the level of costs in each sector.The numerical equivalence at any point in time of assistance in the twosectors, either in terms of the total or amount per head, would be fortuitous.The sectors are very different in size, and different rates of growth of the sectors and extraneous factors affect the balance. For example,as home ownership is growing faster, proportionately more new debt isbeing taken on at current house values. So total assistance and averageassistance per head are rising faster than in the public sector.5.32     An alternative approach might be to focus on the rate of assistanceprovided towards interest payments. This is the one form of assistancefrom which both home-owners and public sector tenants benefit; and itmight provide the basis for forging a reasonable link between them. Thus,home-owners continue to be eligible for tax relief irrespective of any individual need for assistance so long as they have a mortgage outstandingand interest payments to make. Similarly, under the new public sectorsubsidy system, it may be considered desirable to have some minimum provision to ensure that all individual authorities continue to receive some generalassistance in the years ahead. So one possibility would be to introducesome link between the rate of tax relief and the local authority minimumentitlement to subsidy.5.33     Comparisons of assistance stretching ahead into the future havesometimes been held to show that it is a &quot;better buy&quot; in terms of publicfinance to provide a new house in the owner-occupied sector rather thanin the public sector. Under present arrangements general subsidy on anew local authority house is greater in the early years than mortgagetax relief on a similar house bought for home-ownership. But thereafter the value of tax relief tends to remain reasonably steady in real terms as the owner-occupied house is &quot;revalued&quot; through sale and repurchaseat current prices, while the value of subsidy on the local authority housetends to fall in real terms. The true cost to the taxpayer lies in theamount of general assistance paid in respect of those houses over thewhole of their useful life - conventionally assumed to be 60 years. to calculate this in &quot;net present value&quot; terms, assumptions must be made(confidential)45
(confide ntIalabout interest rates, rent levels, house prices, and taxation policy overthe whole period. The &quot;leverage&quot; of initial assumptions about interest rates and other financial factors compounded over a 60 year period isenormous. A relatively small change in the initial assumptions - for exampleabout rates of increase in rents - greatly alters the results.5.34     A further objection to this kind of comparison is that althoughit recognises the contribution of home ownership towards meeting housingrequirements, it ignores the special role of the public sector in dealingwith the most pressing problems. If a public sector authority provides a new house it will normally allocate it to someone at the head of itswaiting list - for example a family rehoused from an unfit house or ahousehold living in overcrowded conditions. There could be no guarantee that if the same new house were built for owner-occupation it would be sold to someone in equally pressing housing need. Consequently, even ifhome-ownership were a &quot;better buy&quot; in terms of cost to the taxpayer, therewould be heavy social costs incurred in concentrating almost exclusivelyon building for home ownership.CONCLUSIONS ON PRICING AND ASSISTANCE5.35     The present financial system, with pricing based on historic costs in the owner-occupied and public rented sectors coupled with general assisdoes have disadvantages. These arrangements may lead to some rigidityin the housing market and may not secure maximum efficiency in the useof resources, or fairness between individuals. But radical alternativespose formidable problems both of principle and practice. Moreover, currentarrangements have been woven into the long-term plans of most householders&apos;It would not be reasonable to replace them unless the case for doing sowas overwhelming.5.36     Although the drawbacks of general assistance cannot be eliminatedthey can be moderated if a reasonable relationship is maintained betweencurrent housing costs and householders&apos; incomes, and levels of generalassistance. Moreover, the burden of general assistance will grow lighterif interest rates in the years ahead tend to follow a lower path thanin recent years. A more effective and fairer use of general assistance could be achieved by a new public sector subsidy system more related to       -needs, /by the eventual abolition of higher rate relief on mortgage inte    &quot;and possibly some link between the rate of assistance towards interest payments in the two main sectors.46(confidential)
(confidential)5.37     The proposed modifications to general assistance in the owner-occupiedand public rented sectors are discussed more fully in Chapters 7 and respectively.(confidential)
(confidentialPART III:     THE WAY FORWARDCHAPTER 6:      A NATIONAL HOUSING policy.01     A housing policy designed to achieve the Government&apos;s housing objectives- set out in Chapter 2 (paragraphs 2.17 - 2.20) - must be flexible enoughto withstand the strain of unforeseen developments and to accommodate a wide range of other social and economic policies. The individual partsof a national housing policy must also be closely interrelated. achievement of all the objectives ultimately depends on a reasonably adequate supplyof housing. And a single policy initiative will often serve several ends- for example, wider access to home ownership will help to meet the preferencesof many people, will ease the pressures in the public sector, and will allow for more flexible use of the housing stock.6.02     This chapter outlines the main elements in the Government&apos;s housing policy. The remaining chapters in Part III discuss the policy proposals in greater detail.LOCAL HOUSING STRATEGIES6.03     Local authorities have a statutory duty to review the housing conditionsof their areas. This duty used to be interpreted primarily as identifyingwhat needed to be done in the public sector. This was right when virtuallyevery authority was confronted with an absolute shortage of housing. Buttimes have changed. Housing conditions now vary widely up and down thecountry.6.04     In this situation it is unrealistic for Westminster and Whitehallto attempt to lay down in detail what action should be taken locally orfor local authorities to interpret their role too narrowly. We need a new relationship between central and local levels of Government, which moreaccurately reflects changing circumstances. Central Government must lay down an overall national policy framework, and provide advice where necessary-But the key to the success of national housing policy now lies in the develop111611of effective local housing strategies, planned and carried out by localauthorities with the minimum of detailed intervention from the centre.48(confidential)
(confidential)6.05     Local authorities need to make assessments of the full range of housing requirements in their areas. Only they can take this broad view.Many authorities are already trying to do this, and are building up thenecessary body of information. Others will have to draw on statistics whichare sometimes out of date and incomplete. But they will be able to providefrom experience the essential information about the character of localproblems which cannot be deduced from national statistics. Against this background, each local authority should draw up a strategic statement backed by statistics on the local housing stock and households and expected changesover the next few years, and a programme for their own proposed housinginvestment (see paragraphs 6.13-6.18 below).6.06     In working out the local housing strategy, local authorities must take account of policies in other fields - such as transport, employment,and social services - within the broad framework of the development plans for the area.6.07     They will want to make sure that there is land available to matchtheir own housing development needs and those of other public agencies.They will also need to ensure that demands for land for private housebuildingare met, either by making land available themselves, or by land ready and available on the open market. It is possible, given the housing objective of achieving an optimum balance between investment on new houses and theimprovement and better use of older ones, that in some places the needfor land for new housebuilding may decline as the emphasis shifts fromredevelopment to rehabilitation. In some areas, the need for any increasein the supply of housing may gradually ease off or may already have done so. In other areas, new developments may take a more prominent place, whether on green field sites or as piecemeal or small-scale redevelopment. Butfactors such as these are essentially local, and will need to be takenregularly into account in investment programmes and land policy statements,along with the changing patterns of transport and land use for the area as a whole.6.08     The local authority&apos;s own investment programme will often lie atthe heart of the local housing strategy. But the local housing strategymust go much wider. In many areas public rented sector provision will provideonly some of the answers. The right local mix of solutions will involveaction by all concerned with rented and owner-occupied housing. It will(confidential)
(confidentialrequire not only investment in new and improved housing, but also initiativesto help people obtain the sort of housing they want - this may involve some re-ordering of priorities both by public sector bodies and by mortgagelenders. The local authorities will need to develop their existing workingrelationships with all other bodies - the Housing Corporation, registeredhousing associations, local housebuilders, building societies, new towncorporations, and county councils - concerned with housing in their areas.6.09     Policy changes arising from this Green Paper must make a full contribu-tion to the problems of inner city areas, particularly where the familiarproblems of decay and neglect are compounded by high building costs anda persistent lack of housing of acceptable standards.  /The White paper on inner city policy (Cmnd ) made clear that?&quot; the Government intend to give priority to local authorities with severe inner area housing problems.In preparing programmes and policies for inner city areas authorities willbe expected to co-ordinate their housing strategy with other proposalsfor regeneration.6.10     The new towns still have an important contribution to make. there remains a need for them to help with the problems of the inner cities.The Government^ aim is to strike the right balance between development in the cities themselves and development outside them, particularly inthe new towns; and to ensure that the new towns provide for as wide a cross-sec-tion of people as possible by making houses available both for rentingand buying.6.11     The Government propose to establish a Housing Consultative Council(HCC) for England with representatives of the local authorities and theDepartment of the Environment under the chairmanship of the Secretary ofState for the Environment, to consider all major issues of concern to localauthorities in the performance of their housing duties. Existing Governmentconsultative machinery involving other bodies concerned with housing, suchas the building societies and housebuilders, will be maintained and developed.Joint discussions between the HCC and other bodies will be arranged when necessary. In Wales, the existing relationship with the Council of the principality will be continued and developed.50(confidential)
(confidential)6.12     The Government believe that concerted action on these lines willforward the development of effective local housing strategies within the framework of the national housing policy.HOUSING INVESTMENT6.13     We still need a substantial level of housing investment in boththe public and the private sectors to help deal with poor housing conditions and special housing needs, and to provide for future growth in the numberof households.6.14     The level of private investment in housing - notably for home-ownership- is largely determined by the level of effective demand. The government can influence it, but do not control it. The level of investment in housing in the public sector however is primarily a matter for Government decision.6.15     Before 1939 local authorities were required to provide for the housing needs of &quot;the working classes&quot;. That limitation was removed from the statutein 1949. The Government do not intend to move back to the days when housingtenure was a matter of social class. Local authorities have become andwill remain the chief providers of rented accommodation. They cater fora wide cross-section of the population. The Government believe that theymust continue to do so, and must also continue to shoulder a particularresponsibility for those with more specialised or urgent needs. These includefor example larger families on lower incomes;  the elderly; the physicallydisabled; people who face special housing difficulties such as one-parent families; and workers who need to move house to take up new jobs. consequently the responsibilities of most local authorities and the problems they facewill still be formidable, and there will be difficult judgements aboutpriorities.6.16     The most pressing housing problems will only yield to a determinedattack by the public sector, but public resources must be used economically and efficiently, and applied where most needed.(confidential)51
(confidential)6.17     The Government therefore propose to institute and develop a systemof local authority housing investment programmes (HIP). These will be drawnup as part of the local housing strategy. They will set out the authority&apos;sproposals for investment in the whole range of its housing activities forthe following four years, within the context of the expected activity ofother public housing bodies in the area and private housebuilders. TheHIPs will be revised each year. This system will make it possible to identify the most urgent problems, and to allocate resources to each authority onthe basis of informed judgements of priorities. A corresponding system will be further developed in Wales.6.18     The Government consider that these arrangements will enable a fasterrate of progress to be made - for any given level of housing investment- in dealing with the most acute housing problems. Naturally, the overallrate of progress will be influenced by the speed of economic recovery.6.19     In the course of the next decade a growing number of local authoritiesshould have very largely dealt with their backlog of bad housing conditions.As this occurs, the overall level of public sector housing investment shoulddecline in response to changing circumstances. The danger of coming topremature and false conclusions, based on inadequate information, aboutthe appropriate level of investment will be avoided by the regular monitoringof progress under local housing strategies and housing investment programmes.FINANCIAL STABILITY6.20     Rapid inflation and large rises in interest rates - and even more,changes in the relation between them - can play havoc with any housing policy unless we have a financial structure that will withstand such strains.6.21     The Government are giving high priority to the control of inflation;success in that effort will go far to reduce the risk of a recurrence ofthe events of 1971-74. But arrangements for housing finance must be robustenough to cope with major shifts in prices and interest rates. In the public sector the Government propose a new and more flexible system of subsidy(see 6.39-6.41 below).2(confidential)
(confidential)6.22     In the owner-occupied sector we need to secure as far as possible a supply of mortgage funds which is not subject to sharp short-term fluctuations,and increases sufficiently over the years to meet fresh demands.6.23     To prevent short term disruptions of the private housing marketthat are harmful both to householders and to the housebuilding industry the Government will develop the present arrangements with the building societies for stabilising the supply of mortgage funds. To guard againstthe risk that in the years ahead societies may not be able to secure allthe finance that they need directly from the personal sector, the government wish to discuss with the societies the possibility of their securing freshsources of funds, possibly through a financial intermediary. The Governmentwill also seek the views of the Committee to Review Financial Institutions(the Wilson Committee) on this proposal in due course.THE HOUSEHOLDER - TENURE6.24     Home ownership. The Government welcome the trend towards home ownership.Home ownership crosses social boundaries; indeed more skilled manual workers are home owners than local authority tenants. Many of those now entering the sector are families who might in former times have considered homeownership to be beyond their reach.6.25     Home ownershipgives many people the kind of home they want. It reduces the demands made on the public sector. It helps with problems of mobility,particularly for people who need to move to a new area when changing jobs.6.26     The Government will therefore promote measures to widen still further the opportunities for home ownership, including a special scheme of government assistance for first-time buyers. The Government also look to building societies and other lenders to provide forms of mortgage facility whichare more helpful to people with modest incomes and to lend more to lowerincome applicants and on cheaper properties - particularly in inner cityareas. Increased Mown market&apos; lending by building societies will involvea close working relationship between the societies and local authorities.(confidential)53
(confidential)6.27     Many local authority tenants wish to become home owners - there.is a large overlap of incomes and occupations between local authority tenants and home owners. If they cannot buy their present house, they may moveout of the area altogether. This is not socially desirable; there is muchto be said for variety of tenure within neighbourhoods, and the Governmentare opposed to rigid separation of private and local authority housing.A local authority&apos;s ability to deal with pressing housing needs and tomaintain a housing stock of adequate quality must not be impaired. Butsubject to these considerations, the Government want local authoritiesto let those tenants who wish to buy do so, within a sensibly regulatedprogramme of sales.6.28     New forms of tenure. The Government also wish to encourage newerforms of tenure, such as equity sharing (part rent, part mortgage), co-ownership *and housing co-operatives. Housing associations and local authorities willhave an important part to play in promoting schemes of this kind.6.29    Renting. But for many, renting will continue to be the best arrangement.This includes those who prefer to rent, and those who cannot buy, even under the proposed measures to widen access to home ownership. It also includes those who need to obtain accommodation quickly for a wide variety of reasons, including of course those who suddenly become homeless. TheGovernment believe that in the longer term there must be increased provisionfor these groups in the public sector. This will involve a liberalisation of local authority tenancy allocation and transfer policies, includingthe prohibition of qualifications for entry to housing waiting lists.6.30     The Government intend to continue their support for registered housing associations. Housing associations, in co-operation with local authorities,can offer an important element of choice in socially owned rented housing,and can provide homes for some people whom some local authorities mightnot always be able to deal with, including mobile key workers and thosesuch as the elderly and the disabled who need special help.4(confidential)
(confide ntjal)6.31     Some people - including, for example, young married couples andolder single prople - cannot afford to buy, and do not have high priority in public sector waiting lists for rented housing while there are families with more pressing housing needs. Other people, such as mobile workersor students, need long-term but temporary accommodation rather than a permanenthome. As housing pressures ease in particular areas, public bodies willbe able to do more to help these people. We can also make some contribution towards dealing with their problems by slowing down the decline in thesupply of privately rented housing. The Government intend, for example,to encourage home owners to let part of their homes by making it easier for them to recover possession, and to encourage local authorities to easerestrictions on sub-letting by their tenants.6.32     Type of housing. Giving people what they want is a matter of typeof housing as well as tenure. It would be wrong to build shoddy houses which will soon become slums. But it is also wrong to impose preconceivedideas on people against their wishes. Some people prefer to live in a modernisedEdwardian &apos;two-up, two-down&apos; rather than a newer house. Some young couplesmay be happy to begin life together in a small &apos;starter&apos; home rather thanwait for a larger but more expensive house. Some young single people prefer to live in bed sitters or to share. Some elderly people prefer to retireto mobile homes. Local planning and housing authorities should do whatthey can to ensure provision of a range of types of housing so that individualscan find a house to suit their personal preferences.THE HOUSEHOLDER - FREEDOM FROM RESTRICTIONS6.33     The financial liabilities of home owners and tenants are different;consequently their rights and responsibilities are different. But it iswrong to regard tenancy as in any sense inferior to ownership. The government propose to develop a &apos;tenants charter&apos; to safeguard and extend tenants&apos;rights in both public and private sectors.6.34     In the public sector, tenants should have security of tenure and better tenancy agreements than are often provided now. They should be freed from unnecessarily restrictive management practices. Local authoritiesshould seek means of achieving greater tenant involvement in housing management- including the development of management of co-operatives - and make afresh attempt to deal with the problems of run-down and difficult-to-letestates.
(confidential)6.35     There is an urgent need for a general improvement in the quality of local authority housing management. Where in the past the answer tomany housing problems was simply to build more houses, in the future itwill increasingly lie in more careful consideration of the needs and problemsof tenants and better use of the existing housing stock. All authoritiesshould aim to reach the standards of the best. The Department of the Environmenthas already established a Housing Services Advisory Group to give advice on housing management practice.6.36     The Review of the Rent Acts provides the opportunity for similarimprovements in the rights of private tenants. Private tenants already have legal security of tenure. But the Government intend to explore thescope for improving their position by giving them the right to obtain grants towards the improvement of their homes; and to purchase their own homeswhere this can be done within a co-operative framework by tenants actingcollectively.RENEWAL6.37     In the 1950s and 1960s, large-scale demolition and the building of big new council estates was often thought to be the only quick way ofdealing with problems of slums and shortages. Great improvements in housing conditions were achieved, though not always in the environment. But theeffects on established communities were sometimes disastrous. We do not need and cannot afford to repeat these mistakes. The Government believethat housing policy should foster and reinforce the development of existingcommunity ties. It will be important to bear this in mind in planning theregeneration of inner city areas.6.38     There can be no clear-cut rule that renovation is to be preferred to new building. The best course will often be a careful mixture of thetwo, and the area improvement provisions of the 1974 Housing Act were meant to encourage this approach. It is too early to assess the results of this legislation. In the meantime, local authorities will be given advice onchoosing between renovation and demolition - taking account of social costs- and asked to concentrate their improvement budgets so far as possible on basic improvements to fundamentally sound houses which might otherwise be lost through neglect, rather than on high quality renovation of relatively small numbers of houses.(confide ntIaT)
(confidential)ASSISTANCE WITH HOUSING COSTS(i)     Public Sector Subsidy6.39     The Government propose to hold consultations with the local authorityrepresentatives and other bodies about a new public sector subsidy system to replace the present interim arrangements. We need to secure a more effective and fairer use of subsidy. This can be done through a system which concentratessubsidy on authorities with pressing housing needs who will consequentlyhave large investment programmes.6.40     The Government consider that the right to fix rents must be left in the hands of locally elected representatives and that rents should continueto be set on a non profit making basis. Local authorities should retain their freedom to supplement Exchequer subsidy with a contribution fromthe General Rate Fund.6.41     Although in the long run, rents and housing costs must stand inreasonable relationship, the Government do not consider that it is sensibleto think in terms of rents meeting some fixed proportion of housing costs in each and every year. Housing costs falling on the accounts can fluctuatewidely from year to year in real terms. It would be unreasonable to expectrents to move immediately to the full extent of such fluctuations. TheGovernment therefore propose to settle annually, in consultation with thelocal authority representatives the contribution to housing costs whichcan reasonably be expected from local resources. All relevant factors,such as past and expected movements in incomes, costs and prices wouldbe brought into the reckoning. This should- avoid the need for irregularand sharp changes in rent levels. The Government consider that over a run of years rents should keep broadly in line with changes in money incomes.(ii)   Mortgage Tax Relief6.42     The Government do not propose to make any changes in the provisionof mortgage interest tax relief /at the basic rateT. By meeting a proportionof interest charges, mortgage tax relief provides most help when it is most needed - in the early years of a mortgage, when interest charges arethe main element in the householder1s monthly outgoings. The  25,000 ceilingon eligible loans limits the amount of relief an individual mortgagor can get. This will be kept under review.(confidential) 57
(confidential)6.43     /But the Government consider that it is wrong to allow relief on mortgage interest at higher rates of tax, thus giving more assistance tothose with higher incomes. They intend eventually to bring this concession to an end, subject to suitable transitional arrangements which will ensurethat no unreasonable burdens are placed upon those who may benefit fromthis relief. The detailed proposals are set out in paragraphs 7.    -7. _7(iii)    Fairness between tenures6.44     Much of the debate on &apos;equity&apos; in housing is sterile: it is an attemptto compare chalk and cheese. The question of comparing the full range of benefits of home ownership and renting was briefly discussed in Chapter5. There are fundamental differences between the two tenures which mustdefeat any attempt to draw up an incontrovertible &quot;balance sheet&apos;.6.45     It does seem right, however, to look for some approach to the provisionof general assistance to both main tenures that would be generally accepted as broadly fair. A possible answer might be to provide powers to prescribea minimum rate of general subsidy towards local authority interest paymentsrelated to the basic rate of tax relief on mortgage interest. The Governmentwould welcome public discussion of this possibility.(iv)    Income Related Assistance6.46     The Government have decided to retain the existing rent rebatesand rent allowances, until a further study of these and other forms of income-related assistance has been completed. Only minor changes seem necessaryin the meantime, such as standardisation of the rate of central Governmentscontribution to the two forms of assistance.6.47     These policy proposals are more fully discussed in the subsequentchapters on the three main housing sectors  (chapters 7, 8 and 9), and onimprovement policy (chapter 10). Policies affecting particular groups ofhouseholders are considered in Chapter 11; and the relevance of the policyproposals as a whole to inner urban areas and London is considered in thefinal chapter (chapter 12). This is followed by a summary of the specific proposals made in the Green Paper.^ m(confidential)
