DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(77) 39 COPY NO    Q 029 April 1977CABINETVACCINE DAMAGEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. Home and Social Affairs (HS) Committee have had two discussions of this difficult issue without reaching a clear consensus of view.    I am therefore referring it to the Cabinet for decision.background. The Association of Parents of Vaccine Damaged Children have forsome time been campaigning for payment of compensation to vaccinedamaged children.    This campaign has recently been intensified byMr Jack Ashley MP.    Many less children are now being vaccinated againstpoliomyelitis, diphtheria and other potentially crippling or killing diseases.The largest fall - 59 per cent between 1971 and 1975 - is in whooping coughvaccinations.    The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation are greatly concerned about the public health implications:  already there havebeen more cases of poliomyelitis during the past six months than during any similar period this decade.3. The question of compensation for personal injury generally is beingconsidered by the Royal Commission on Civil Liability and Compensationfor Personal Injury under Lord Pearson.    The Commission are not expected to report before the autumn at the earliest, but the Lord chancellor and the Secretary of State for Social Services have ascertained, in discussionwith Lord Pearson, that they have already considered the issue of vaccinedamage and are unanimous that compensation should be payable.Lord Pearson did not however feel able to commit himself to the view thatvaccine victims formed a special case:  the Commission were finding thewhole question of compensation for injuries resulting from medical treatment a difficult one, and would eventually have to fit vaccine damageinto a general picture which was not yet settled;  nor had they yet reached a view on how compensation for vaccine damage should be calculated or onthe criteria which must be satisfied in order to establish entitlement.But he was satisfied that an acceptance by the Government of the principle ofcompensation for vaccine damage would cause the Royal Commission noembarrassment.1
DISCUSSION4. The Secretary of State for Social Services feels strongly that theGovernment will sooner or later have to accept the principle ofcompensation for vaccine damage;  and that to announce this now, leaving the details of the scheme to be worked out in the light of the Pearson Report,would take the heat out of the campaign, whose continuance will causepolitical damage, and help him to reverse the decline in the uptake ofvaccination.    He is also concerned that the Government have a moralresponsibility for serious damage caused to children, albeit withoutliability or negligence, by those vaccination programmes which theGovernment actively promote;  and that we should not be seen to be forcedreluctantly into an acceptance of the justice of their case.5. There was a wide measure of agreement in HS Committee that thecase for some compensation for vaccine damage would sooner or laterhave to be conceded and that it should apply to existing as well as futurecases.    Considerable doubt was expressed, however, about the legalimplications of an entirely new commitment in principle by the Governmentto pay compensation where there was no evidence of fault or negligence.Some members of the Committee therefore took the view that it would be imprudent to abandon our present stance that no decision should be taken inadvance of the Pearson Report.    This view was supported by the followingarguments:a. To concede the principle of compensation at this stage mightmerely serve to confirm the belief that vaccines, and particularlywhooping cough vaccine, were unsafe and so undermine the programmes still further.b. &quot;Without knowing what recommendations the PearsonCommission might make on compensation for personal injurygenerally, and for that resulting from medical treatment generally,the Government could have no confidence of being able to draw theline at compensation for vaccine damage as being a whollyexceptional case.    The point of pressure might therefore simplybe transferred from vaccine damage to other equally deservingconditions.c. A number of difficult problems would have to be resolved,hopefully with adequate guidance from the Pearson Report, before a scheme could be worked out and legislation introduced to giveeffect to it.    These are set out in the annexed note by officials.Meanwhile, potential beneficiaries would receive nothing.6. The Committee did not see the cost of a compensation scheme forvaccine damage as a serious objection provided that the scheme did not have repercussions for compensation or other payments elsewhere, including war
pensions and industrial injuries schemes.    Estimates of cost can be no more than guesswork until decisions are taken, in the light of the PearsonReport, on the form of payments and the qualifying criteria.    Paragraph 12of the note by officials gives the best estimates available:  on a lump sumbasis up to  12. 5 million for existing cases (say, up to 500) and up to 1.75 million per annum for future cases (say, up to 70 per annum); on a weekly payment basis, very much less per annum.    The Secretary of Statefor Social Services proposes that the cost should be provisionally regardedas a claim on the Contingency Reserve.7. The Cabinet will wish to consider the legal and financial implications of moving into a new field of liability for services promoted by theGovernment.    I believe however that the basic judgments to be made are essentially political:  whether a commitment in principle to the paymentof compensation, which would be presented, in part, as an affirmation ofthe Government&apos;s continuing confidence in the vaccination programmes,would help to reverse the decline in uptake;  whether it would make itunduly difficult to resist future pressures, or recommendations of thePearson Commission, for compensation;  and whether the Governmentwould be able to rest on a commitment in principle to which effect wouldnot be given until after the Pearson Report had been received and considered.U RHome Office29 April 19773
COKPEWSATIOK FOR VACCINE DAKAGENote by officials at their meeting on 6 April, the Home arid Social Affaire Committee askedofficials (IJS(7V) 5th Meeting, Item 1) to carry out an urgent examination of thfinancial and other implications of a scheme for compensating existing andfuture cases of vaccine damaged children, with particular reference to thenature and extent of Government liability which would thereby he accepted..2,   This has proved a difficult task, for two main reasons -i*. The&apos; information about the number of cases of vaccine damage,whether new or existing, is.very imperfect.     We understand that theposition is likely to be improved within the next year or two, but inthe meantime the lack of a firm information, base makes sound fore castingvirtually impossible.ii. The report of the Royal Commission on Civil Liability and Compensationfor Personal Injury is likely to have a bearing - but how close we cannotsay - on the detailed aspects of any compensation scheme, for example, wheththere should be lump sum or weekly payments, the amount of payments and the qualifying criteria.     It seems necessary to await the report beforeattempting to settle these questions provided that this implies no priorcommitment to acceptance of its recommendations.     Per the same reason,we have found it difficult to comment usefully on the wider implications of a decision to offer compensation for vaccine damage in isolation.     TheRoyal Commission will be considering vaccine damage in a much wider context,and we have net been able to identify possible implications with anyprecision in the absence of knowledge about how any scheme for compensationfor vaccine damage will relate to the broader recommendations to bo made bythe Royal Commission in respect of personal injury generally.3-   In these circumstances we have been able to do little more than seek to identify a number of considerations which will at a later stage need to be carefully examined, and which, since they might prove to be a source of difficulty    particularly if a scheme of compensation for vaccine danage hadto be introduced in isolation - ought to be borne in mind when Ministersdeciding whether to commit themselves in principle to compensation :&apos;s d reor vaccine
damage.   We hare cinilarly-jlot&quot;bewabrc-fcc&quot;&quot;deve&apos;lo&apos;p any satisfactory estimates of -the likely cost of such a scheme.   The fact is that, in accepting theprinciple of compensation for vaccine damage, Ministers would be venturinginto waters which are at the moment largely uncharted^in the belief - whichmight prove unjustified - that it would be possible to produce satisfactorycharts after the Royal Commission has reported.A.   In the paragraphs below we accordingly seek, under four main, headings, to direct attention to some of the principle issues which seem to us relevant andwhich would have to be tackled before the legislation which would be required was prepared.Who is to be covered by the scheme?5.   The points needing attention can perhaps most conveniently be indicated by posing a series of questions:-i. Will compensation be payable only to those who have themselvesbeen vaccinated and suffered damage as a result, or will it go wider?For example, should compensation be payable to someone who, as weunderstand is possible, contracts poliomyelitis from a person who hasbeen vaccinated?  We understand that en out of court payment of  20,000has recently been made by DHSS, without airy acceptance of liability, toa father who contracted poliomyelitis as a resuitor.of his child5svaccination/ii. Is compensation to be limited to persons who have been vaccinatedunder the National Health Service?iii. Should the scheme relate only to vaccines which are Included inthe Schedule of Vaccination and Immunisation Procedures included to tbeStanding Medical Advisory Committee&apos;s Memorandum &quot;Immunisation Againsti a,Infectious Disease&quot;? The vaccines concerned are those against diphtiie*&apos;tetanus, whooping cough, poliomyelitis, measles, rubella and tubercul0 &quot;(BOG) - broadly speaking those which are recommended for administrative-09children as a general preventive measure.   They exclude other vaccineStowhich are administered only in limited and defined circumstances - e$adults who ore travelling to certain foreign, countries.iv. Is compensation to be payable to people who have already suffer0vaccine damage?   If so, how far back would it be acceptable to go -what, for example, would be the position of people who had suffered
harmful effects cefore&quot;&quot;&quot;tlicr&quot; KHS &quot;began?^nere would probably bodifficulties, increasing the further back one v:ent, in establishingthat damage could be attributed to vaccination rather than to someother cause.   Would some special rules have to be made - eg theestablishment of a cut-off point beyond which claims would not be entertained?   (There is a precedent for this in the industrial injuriesfield.)   Would the compensation payable be assessed only from, a currentdate even though eligibility stemmed from damage at some previous date?V.   Would any payment bo due for those who could be shown to have suffered vaccine damage in the past but are now dead?6*   There are some quite difficult questions here, but all of them seem inprinciple to be soluble.   At this stage, the main need seems to. be to avoid giving any commitment which would involve increasing the scope of the schemebeyond the absolute minimum - for example, no indication should be given that compensation would bo due in respect of vaccine damage for people who are nowdead; nor that all people who have been damaged by vaccination in the pastwill necessarily qualify for compensation.   This will leave Ministers the maximumfreedom of action when the time comes to determine the details of the scheme.What is to be the nature of the scheme?7.   A number of questions arise in this connection.   They include the following:i. Is compensation to take the form of a lump sum or of a weekly payment?In either case, are the payments to be index-linked, or in some other wayprotected against inflation; and if so, by what means?   (See also paragraph 9(iii) below.)ii. How is the amount of compensation to be determined?   Should the degreeof pain and suffering be excluded and compensation be assessed on loss ofexpectations or on cost of care outsj.de the 31113?      Should the amount vary according to the degree of disability?iii. With what certainty should it be established that the damage can in face be attributed to vaccination; and by what means is the connection tobe established?   This is a matter of crucial importance for the operationof any scheme.   Some children suffer convulsions, and in come casesconsequential brain damage, entirely spontaneously; and therefore theestablishment of a direct causal, link with vaccination is a matte:;:&apos; of very
great difficulty.   The main &quot;practical issue is how far it will he frxo.&amp;edesirable to give the applicant&apos;the benefit of the doubt.   It would inprinciple be possible to establish a presuj-.ipti.on. that damage followingvaccination was caused by the vaccination unless the contrary could be shown: but this might be thought to tip the balance too fax.    However-,those questions arc finally answered, it seems clear that the acceptan0of entitlement to compensation in individual cases would have to rest ona medical assessment of the part likely to have been played by vaccia&amp;tion&apos;:&apos;and that there would be some extremely difficult borderline cases. -iv. What authority should be responsible for adjudicating on claims sn**what5 if any, appeal rights should be provided?   The answer will depsn&quot; agood deal upon the nature of the scheme, and whether there is to hocounterpart elsewhere in the compensation field.   It is arguable thatscale of operations would not justify the establishment of an indepen^83.Board specifically for the purpose of administering a vaccine damagecompensation scheme.   On the other  hand, a good many claims might be   ^ jsubmitted but not accepted; and an independent body would have presentsadvantages.   But whatever adjudication machinery wore adopted; it seeslikely that the administrative costs would be appreciable,v. Should the payments be regarded as a settlement of any liability! .tJ&apos;what implications would there be for the principle of no-fault liaosl-*-&quot;*&apos;The present uosition is that an action in negligence alleging a breaelpa duty of care could be brought against the Department (and/or one ofagents), the doctor who administered the vaccine, or the manufacture!ffeO*the vaccine - 5 or 4 such cases are in fact already pending.   The -of a compensation scheme could be to protect the Department and itsfrom proceedings for negligence: but it is not self-evident that, the?should be conrolete protection, or that similar protection should extension-the doctor or to the manufacturer (eg where the vaccine had been a&amp;3  &apos;tered despite the existence of known contra-indications, or was co-*u&apos;. vh^&apos;8,   It is ii.nposs.ible to attempt answers to these questions until we know; -recommendations have been made by the Royal Commission.   The questions b*    ^difficult ones, and here again if a commitment to the principle of ccaps:girls&apos;   -is given it is important that Ministers should avoid giving any hostages *&quot;*the nature, coverage etc of whatever scheme ultimately emerges.

It is impossible to make any assessment of cost until the report of thePearson Commission has been received end considered and it has been decidedwhat is to be the form.of compensation (whether lump sum or weekly payment),and what qualifying criteria are to apply.   The extent to which people whohave suffered vaccine damage in the past are to be . eligible for compensationwill also be relevant.10,   As noted earlier, the information about the number of cases of vaccinedamage is unfortunately very imperfect.   We understand.that, in relation tovaccines included in the Schedule of Vaccination and Immunisation Procedures,ail average of 7 cases a year are reported of adverse reactions which may giverise to some degree of permanent damage.   But only a proportion of such casesera in fact reported, and the view taken by DHSS is that the true number ofcases, per year is unlikely to be less than double or more than ten times thenumber of cases reported.   The number of new cases a year therefore probablylies somewhere between 14 and r(0f and 50 would seem a reasonably safe workingassumption.   JTo doubt the degree of disability would vary, and therefore the&apos;size of any compensation payment might also vary.   The annual additional cost would therefore be quite small, even if lump sum payments were made, raidrelatively trifling if there were weekly payments.11.   As regards people who have suffered vaccine damage in the past, all thatis known is that trie Association of Parents of Vaccine Damaged Children claims to have about 500 such documented cases.   While there may be other cases whichbare not yet come to light, it seems very likely that an appreciable proportionof the 500 will be cases where it cannot be established to an acceptable degreeof likelihood that the damage was in feet caused by vaccination.   It might be reasonable to guess that compensation would in the end be adjudged payable in about 300 oases - but this figure is no more then a guess and should be treatedas such.   The immediate cost, if lump sum payments were made, would thereforebe considerable,- running into some millions of pounds but the annual cost of-Weekly payments, though very much less initially, would bvJld up over the years.i confidential ,
12.     The above figures for the numbers of eases are very tentative and shouldbe regarded as nc more than guesswork at this stage.     But to give some idea ofthe kind of coats that could bo involved - excluding the costs of administration the following table gives a possible rouge of costs on the assumption (which hasbeen adopted purely for illustrative purposes) that the average compensation payments would be of the order of  25,000 (lump sum) or  10 (weekly payment):-Eri$ting Cases Few Cases Tier Annum-(&quot;To&apos; 500)&quot;&quot;&apos; &apos;0T&apos;t o &quot;70)Lump sum  7,500,000 to  12,500,000  350,000 to  1,750,000Weekly payments         156,000 to       260,000  7,280 to       36,400(per annum)The annual cost of weekly payments end of administering&apos;them would grow overtime as the number of cases increased and the payments were presumably upratedby analogy with other benefits.     Vie do not at present, however, have thenecessary actuarial information to enable us to calculate the possible rateof increase.     Total costs could of course be substantially greater if theintroduction of this scheme had repercussions for compensation or other payir.eis*felsewhere*13*     There is no provision in existing public expenditure programmes for theadditional expenditure involved.     Unless, therefore, offsetting savings weremade in the social security or health and personal social services programmes,or in other programmes, the costs of compensation would have to be considered as a claim on the contingency reserve.What are the wider implications of the scheme?14*     Tho implications of a scheme for compensation for vaccine damage whicfl -to be introduced in isolation would be very, wide, and all we have been able tdo is to give a few examples.ic   l)i the medical field it must be recognised thai almost any procedureflirtcan give rise to an adverse reaction for which no-one is to blame.give one or two examples - the delivery of a baby by forceps can producebrain damage\    drugs which have been through the specified trialprocedures and have been licensed by the Medicines Commission can haveunlooked-for side effects;   blood iransfunions can, through no--oue*!-;. ,      - -i oiproduce- serious reactions.     There is therefore a considerable ran^injuries resulting from medical treatment where it mignx be argueathe case for compensation was as good as in relation to vaccine damag6
ii.   Going more w.ii&apos; comueiisation wereavailable for vaccine damage ii ought also to be available for anyone&quot;vho suffers damage caused by a public service, though without any element of negligence, or by any form of safety precaution which has been adoptedin order to reduce the risk of industrial or other -injury.iii.   The form of compensation payment could cause difficulties.   Forexample, if the amounts paid out, or any form of index-linking forperiodical payments, appeared to contract favourably with those currentlyapplicable under the war pensions and industrial injuries schemes, this could lead to pressure for further improvement of those- schemes.   Thetheoretical ground for making the payments night also have important implications.   If, for example, they were presented as, at least in part,representing compensation for pain and suffering or loss of expectations,.similar claims might be advanced in respect of other typos of payment.   Itis particularly relevant here that the cash benefit schemes currentlyadministered by KISS (the purpose of which range from the relief of short-term hardship to coslpensationfor personal injury and to the maintenance of income until the&apos; claimant dies) overwhelmingly provide weekly payments andnot lump sums.   There is thus a presumption that any scheme for compensationfor vaccine damaged children should follow this precedent; and the provisionof lump sums, which seems to be what those who are pressing for compensationmay&apos;actually want, co-old have embarrassing repercussions.   On the other hand,there would be some difficulty in determining the amount and defining .therationale of weekly payments, given that many of those who have sufferedvaccine damage are already in receipt of one of the existing weekly cash benefits.   And it should be noted that weekly payments would inevitably involve higher administrative costs,lVf   There would also be legal problems; such as extinction of any remedyat law (whether in pending proceedings or not), appeals,, and the manner of payment where the injured person was still a child.which would have to boexamined in the light of the Pearson Report.v.   The question of retrospection, involve; special difficulties.   TheGovernment&apos;o present position 3s that, while the recommendations of thePearson Commission arc expected to be prospective only, it remains open7
io the Coverrjaent to consider whether any of them should be toplesson^with retrospective effect..   It would have to be made clear thatretrospection for vaccine daiaags would not necessarily imply xt irospeelsewhere; c-:id this -would require it to be demonstrated that the vacc1-&apos;-dariage soheus was sui generis.   Failure to show that the scheme was nobe taken as a precedent could have seriov-s repercussions in all otnerfields of personal, injury and death.15. &apos; Here again, it is impossible to reach any firm conclusions until thereport of the Pearson Commission has been received and considered and it Isknown how they propose to deal, with compensation for vaccine damage and bothis relates to compensation for other injuries resulting from medical and indeed to the substance of the report generally,   rbo problems would 00greatest if the main Pearson re commendations had to be rejected either becatfi. j -f,&apos;..Sthey were unacceptable in principle or because they involved public expe-1--&quot;-Jat a level which could not at present be contemplated; so that a schema olcompensation for vaccine damage had to be introduced in isolation or frars- \a basis (eg as to retrospection) not acceptable to Government for carp--1-&apos;-&quot;&quot;&apos;in other fields.   It would then be important to be able to draw a &quot;ring i&amp;IiL&quot;round vaccine damage by showing that there were&apos;.good reasons for treatinga special case.   Arguments which might perhaps be used are that vfav.c&apos;--special because Government has, by means of advertising campaigns and the -u-&quot;promoted it to an extent to which it has not promoted other forms of medic3-&apos;-treatment; and because,although primarily for the benefit of the indivri-w9&quot;^is to a limited extent for the benefit of society also.   We believe that tfcijline of argument could be used, though only with caution - this is rot tb4 u&quot;form of treatment which has bean promoted, and DHSS have always presenteevaccination&apos; as being primarily for the benefit of the individual vaccir^eA&apos;22 April 1977
