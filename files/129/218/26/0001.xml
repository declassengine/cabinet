CONFIDENTIAL^   RUNNING COSTS^^.5*     Following our discussion in July (CC(84) 25th Conclusions, Minute 5), X^Lwili be seeking to agree with colleagues a figure, for most^artments in line with the provision sought in the Survey, for the &apos;0:ase in their running costs in 1985-86.   I will then expect Estimates ^sion for running costs to be within the agreed figure.   My aim &apos; to agree running cost figures that in aggregate imply an increase Bore than 4 per cent above this year&apos;s provision.   This approach be affected by our choice of a pay assumption.assume,-should avoid any formal announcement of the paythe         nWfore other public expenditure decisions are announced inaso,,^&quot;1111     In tne last two years we explicitly announced the pay !s!umption.    in both&quot;  re the Autumn S lotion, and t ^Ptions are a &gt;setMnt arrangementS ettlementsandC0NCLUSIONcases, we got unhelpful headlines.
