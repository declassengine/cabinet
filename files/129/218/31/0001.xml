CONFIDENTIALMO 6/12ANNEX DTORNADOS FOR TURKEYsub sub Hie of1 have seen Norman Tebbit&apos;s recent minute to you on this  ^ect-    Unfortunately, I shall be out of the country when the Dect is to ke considered in OD, and Adam Butler will representat th meeting.    I should put on record-, however,  that my viewe balance of risks and advantages on this matter coincides with at  f Norman Tebbit.1 also agree with Norman&apos;s conclusion that the Government Ughtb6to find some special way of providing the credit support requested,  subject to British Aerospace being able to arrangePrivate sector share of the risk.    As I said in my minute to ^  0    13th August, quite apart from the industrial arguments in  f Government support, Turkey&apos;s position on NATO&apos;s flankyouitiak All&lt;-ne Tornado deal of particular military significance to the e as a whole.to i*.

PRIME MINISTERTORNADOS FOR TURKEY1 minuted you on 10 August on difficulties arising for us in providing export credit support for the prospective sale to the Turkish airforce of 40 Tornados.    Nigel Lawson, Quintin Hailsham, Michael Heseltine, Janet Young and Arthur Cockfield have all commented.    The problem arises essentially from the large payment risk exposure that would arise which cannot be accepted by ECGD as a normal Section 2 operation, even on the basis of risk sharing with the Private sector.2 When I wrote before, we were looking at a potential UK  rder of about  435m (which would have meant an exposure ^king into account interest etc of about  600m).    BAe have since revised their estimates and have told us that, with cost escalation, spares etc, and with the private sector being unable to support more than 60% of the risk, theJH1AXPCONFIDENTIAL319

However, there is no evidence the Turkish Ministry of Finance has yet approved thetha1deaJtheThe Turks have emphasised that for operational reasons order cannot be reduced in size.    Although ECGD&apos;s e*P  would be very large, the balancing share to be carne the commercial banks and BAe and its principalBAesub-contractors has also increased substantially-JHCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALbelieve there is a reasonable prospect of this risk sharing arrangement being taken by the private sector, although in ECGD&apos;s view this is doubtful and it is almost certain that the later maturities will fall to HMG to support.1 realise that the arguments are carefully balanced here. Those in favour of giving the HMG support necessary to secure the order are as follows:a) The industria    case is strong, as I made clear in my minute of 10 August.    I accept Nigel Lawson&apos;s point that there is no commitment to the EFA programme at Present.    This makes export orders for Tornado still more significant industrially.    Besides Turkey, I understand that there are also export prospects in Saudi Arabia and Oman  (initially 20 and 8 aircraft respectively).    Both are going to be difficult and are likely to be strongly influenced if we can secure the Turkish order.    Taken together, these three Possibilities offer an opportunity for the UK to improve its disappointing record in large defence export contracts  (as compared for example with the prench).    Some measure of the industrial importance of the Turkey sale can be gauged from BAe employmentCONFIDENTIALJH1AXP
CONFIDENTIALprojections. There are 4000 direct production s Warton.    BAe estimate that these will reduce totaffat2500 W1990 even if the Saudi and Oman orders are won Turkish order alone would enable an additional 500 production staff to be maintained through to 1990;Theb) The Tornado programme is also of great sign11 to the aero engine and equipment industries. R l^5 Royce&apos;s share of the Turkish order is estimated t0 amount to  60 million initially, plus a further million in spares business;c) The main repayments on any credit for Tornados not commence until around 1987/88;w0uIdd) We must recognise that the Turks place greatimportance on the purchase of these aircraft fr mmayusand our partners. A refusal to provide finance damage relations with a country which, as Janet points out,  is one of our closest allies. Ontheother hand, the Greeks can hardly complain, since offered them the aircraft as well and they rejecte&lt;weit:e) If the UK does not supply these aircraft theTur*5JHCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwill probably buy them elsewhere.    The USA or France will be only too ready to displace us, and can be expected to have fewer difficulties in offering finance on favourable terms; andf) The Turks have scrupulously met their obligations to date on BAe&apos;s existing sales of Rapier and Sea Skua missiles (which were mainly for cash).4 The main arguments against HMG support are(a) The risk exposure now proposed of about  350m is far above ECGD&apos;s existing market limits for Turkey, which will be facing difficult debt servicing problems from 1985 onwards as previously rescheduled debts fall due for payment again;(b) Although Turkey&apos;s recent record on military debts has been satisfactory, Turkey has rescheduled its civil debts on many occasions, and ECGD is still owed some  l20m which will not be repaid finally until 1992;(c) BAe have already had the benefit of almost all of the new medium term ECGD cover for Turkey allocated soJH1AXPCONFIDENTIAL321
CONFIDENTIALfar (some  77m for Rapier and Sea Skua missiles)?thenormal commercial exports have increased by 40% inatfirst seven months of 1984 and are currently runningan annual rate of  330m;  if support on the scale_ity toproposed is agreed this would pre-empt any capac-1 give cover for other project business  (which would undoubtedly cause vigorous protests from many UK companies, currently negotiating in Turkey); an^a&quot;d(d) There must be doubts about the ability of the private sector to carry its share of the exposure so there is a risk that BAe will ask for more HMG support later.to be5   &apos;As I mentioned in my previous minute,  if ECGD wereId  einstructed to take a commitment of this order,  it woufor thenecessary for this to be announced to Parliament and commitment to be taken outside ECGD&apos;s trading accounts-6   This is a difficult decision.    On the one hand theconcern at Turkey&apos;s economic prospects.    On the other+  r i^lthe case is strong on strategic, political and indusht t grounds.
