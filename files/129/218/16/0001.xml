The cost of these three key services in ^2~83 was around  950 million, of which less than  17 million was $*v,racted out.   The scope for savings is illustrated by the factin 12 recent contracts for cleaning and laundry services savings million have been made.    At present,  the responses of the ^^J^h^uthorities to this request are being assessed by the Department H^t^and Social Security.NatT0K^-cS?t&gt; INDUSTRIES &gt;most central and local government activities,  those ofindustries already take place in a commercialenvironment.
