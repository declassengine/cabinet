My proposal is to raise the retail price by a further 1p and then to hold it at that level until at least March 1985.Against this proposal, colleagues have argued that:A retail price increase is not yet justified, particularly the distributors have been overpaid to date and will only move o deficit in the summer.    I believe that the results of the ^Z&amp;st review fully justify an early increase in the retail price and thX&amp;^hat I have proposed is modest especially given the fall in prod^ers&apos; incomes.
