For 1985-86 and 1986-87 that means ^we must stick to the baseline.   Given the bids that colleagues have orward this will be a formidable task.    But we can do no less if we 0 maintain the credibility of our economic strategy, and to give &apos;es some room for easing the tax burden.For 1987-88 we have now to establish a planning total figure for thetjje     t:Line.
