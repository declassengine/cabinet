&apos;     The independent airlines have survived and grown over the last a ^.years  partly through the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) pursuingiberal policy of trying to give them routes in order to increase ^petition with BA, and partly because of BA&apos;s appalling inefficiency A . about 1981.   Under Lord King BA has become much more efficient, indeed aggressive, and now seeks to undercut its much weaker titors.    BA has 81 per cent of United Kingdom scheduled routes, l^as the dominant position in Heathrow.

Daribbean: this was not suggested by the CAA who preferred to recommend the Saudi Arabia routes for transfer since they are more profitable and more easily extractable from BA&apos;s network.   The Caribbean routes do   however, fit in quite well with BCal&apos;s existing operations to South America S^N. and southern United States.   Their transfer would reduce BA &lt;^\Vurnover by about  50 million or 2.1 per cent, depending on \^#hich particular routes were transferred   and operating  t by some  (5-10) million or (1.8-3.6) percent.re currently licensed to serve Riyadh and were they Jo do^ ating profit on services to Saudi Arabia would fall from million figure above to some  16 million    This 13airlines would have to share the fixed number of encies available to the United Kingdom, so that a BCal JJadh woula reduce the number of flights BA could mount. ^ the moment, however, no British airline serves Riyadh and the Saudis have made i .Cal&apos;s proposed s/ ls therefore betw&amp;&gt; also allowing them to accept BCal as th transferring the exist!-take Riyadh off BCal and^gularly unattractive -Particularly profitable ro uld also mean taking away n  operate.

Possible settlement figures for theother n  Private actions (and any new ones) cannot be estimated. Ptions for BA privatisation to attempt to offset the ffeots oftheUS suits and meet the planned timescale includefoilowingflotation with the liability.    Anti trust liabilities are not regarded as an insuperable obstacle to company flotations in the United States,  and there is growing familiarity withthe problem in the UK.    At the end of the day this is for the market to judge but advice from the merchant bankers is that flotation should not be jeopardised if in the prospectus the Directors can state,  taking into account advice from US Counsel,  that the US suits are unfounded
CONFIDENTIAL - 6 -or without merit and that they will be vigorously defended.    This is the course that BA hope to pursue but which they are still considering, doubtless in the light of US developments.(b) the airlines might reach an acceptable  u-r thisof court settlement, but the timing  x is unpredictable.(c) BA may be able to insure their interest. However they are reluctant to probe too deeply into this unless and until nece for fear of spreading alarm.    In princiP they appear to be satisfied that insurannf a Siven cover for any liability in excess 01figure appears to be a viable option.(d)    the Government have guaranteed BA&apos;s ere  Theagainst a BA default before privatise  the .  p whenGovernment could decide, at the time^ nue afterprospectus is finalised,  to i~-llu.j 4-Q damageS privatisation a guarantee limitedin the Laker suits or to the excess  ve^sihiypredetermined sum (though this mign require legislation).
CONFIDENTIAL - 7 -6 T in considering these options it is important that nothinge clone which would undercut the position of HMG in its dispute With th^ne US Government.    This affects options  (a) and (d) above.So  as option (a) is concerned the ability to float success-ully With the liability may be dependent upon BA&apos;s unhampered a.b i i i t LCy to defend themselves in the US courts.    However HMG object,,ts strenuously to the US court proceedings and has invoked the prpTiJ- Act to prohibit disclosure of UK located documents, comrneroT t&apos;-j-ai information etc.    This issue is currently underOration.    So far as option (d) is concerned it is difficult to see hnow HMG could stand guarantor to meet awards arising^luceedings to which it has so strenuously objected,simply to pUrSue BA privatisation.    However this is a possible, though^attractive, option as one of the measures to maintain theUK Posit-tlon in the wider dispute.7Th &quot;nis paper does not attempt fully to analyse or present 0ptions rIOr dealing with the hydra-headed complexities of theQispute.    In broad terms the position is that if BA (and BCal \^ remain exposed to current and anticipated US suitsthle financial consequences are potentially very serious; equally, if HMG rtaecides to pursue the dispute vigorous!:   t$ere could be in UK/US aviation relations which could give rise to out BA&apos;s services to the USA.    Either way a spill-overaiarm^ Ba  Privatisation seems an unavoidable possibility,252
