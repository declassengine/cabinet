We cannot expect that ence our critics;    they will continue to argue that we should roore still.    This plea is always seductive and strikes a chord supporters.    Certainly no-one can deny that certain types of ^oject should be a high priority for any Government.

6 table sets out the adjustment in moving from the old to the w presentation of capital expenditure.    These are:a&gt;     figures of gross domestic fixed capital formation areshown in the.national accounts net of assets sales. But in measuring   new work placed with industry it is not appropriate to deduct (or add) sums which merely transfer the ownership of assets between the public and private sectors.   Hence, the adjustment excludes the purchase and sales of land and existing buildings.    Council house sales is by far the largest component, which has risen from under  500 million in 1978-79 to over  2000 million a year now.b.u.by international convention, virtually all defence expenditure is classified as current not capital.    The adjustment includes the NATO definition of defence capital expenditure rather than the conventional definition.    The NATO definition of capital covers equipment (excluding ammunition) and construction, but excludes spares and repair and maintenance.    It gives a groad indication of expenditure of a capital nature rather than operating c sts, although the method of compilation is necessarily approximate.external financing limits rather than capital expenditure ar&gt;e scored within the planning total for nationalised industries and some other public corporations. The ad3ustment substitutes their aggregate capital exPenditure, which is currently around  7 billion a Vear and has shown little change in real terms since 1978-79.the adjustment omits net lending from the total.
