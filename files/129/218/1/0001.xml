CONFIDENTIALTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(84) 1 &lt;s^/&amp;^ January 1984COPY NOCABINETNON-DOMESTIC RATING REVALUATIONandum by the Secretary of State for the Environment and the \&quot;&apos; _ Secretary of State for WalesOur decision^that rates should remain for the foreseeable future the main source of local revenue for local government&quot; (Rates White Paper, Cmnd 9008, paragrapb-2^. 15) obliges us to correct the distortions that have arisen in the tax Msensince the last general revaluation in England and Wales in 1973.   ThK^p^nalies are most significant in the non-domestic sector.    In the WhiteVPadlr, we proposed &quot;to set in train the work required for a non-doma* vy revaluation&quot; (paragraph 5.8).2.

We have now to decide when the non-do^&lt;stic revaluation should become effective.   We favour 1 April 1987,. the earnest feasible date; the Chief Secretary, Treasury favours 1 April 1989 - after the next Election. The White Paper did not indicate any date.    In responding to consultation the Confederation of British Industry and other r^ri^entatives of industry and commerce, the local authority associations ans^W^pjof essional bodies interested have all welcomed the recognition that a WoTHdomestic revaluation is needed and have pressed for it to take place as s&amp;Hd^s) possible. Most have also sought frequent and regular revaluations the^EFFECT OF A REVALUATION4. Significant changes in relative rental values have occu^d 1973.    Older industry and small businesses outside city centr_ bear an unfairly high proportion of the rates burden and would from a revaluation.

The l bfc&amp;p the delay in revaluation the worse the anomalies will^ become and^Se greater the adjustments needed.   We could cushion the impact of revaluati^Ja by legislating to phase in the changes over a few years. But we should resist such a move.    It would defeat much of the purpose of revaluation by postponing the rectification of existing anomalies and would be particularly crir^i^ised by those ratepayers who stand to gain from the revaluation.EFFECT ON LOCAL AUTHVENUE AND ON DOMESTIC RATEPAYERS7.

Some 700 additional staff, 400 of them professionally qualified, will be required in the Valuation Office, Inland Revenue, for the non-domestic revaluation.   They will need to be wo E3xg for 2 years before the revaluation takes effect and will then have tfc(jde#l with the inevitable appeals work which follows on the introduction of^^riewslist.   The Chief Secretary, Treasury considers that there is nothing (lc&gt;^aose between 1987 and 1989 for this purpose; the staff will be an un^r/gme claim on the contingency reserve and would in either case affect manpower figures at 1 April 1988.FEASIBILITYaublic sector1QR7     t *:av\lest Practicable date for a non-domestic revaluation^ &apos; ./&quot;f Revenue would need to recruit the staff required W%  fJilil 1985;,new ^sts would be published at the end of 1986 and&gt; rrective on 1 April 1987.

CONFIDENTIALmatters are well aware that such a date would be feasible; some have sought a still earlier date.   They will know that any later date would represent a deliberate decision to delay the revaluation.EF SECRETARY, TREASURY&apos;S VIEWSThe Chief Secretary, Treasury acknowledges the case for aestic revaluation.   But he believes that the political impact of the ion is potentially such that it would be unwise to risk it taking ^xKthe run-up to an Election.    Its effect is to redistribute ratea^l p^lue.    There would be gainers and losers.   But complaints from those vuo^^se almost invariably outweigh gratitude from those who gain. As parag&amp;i hy3 makes clear some losers will face substantial increases. These couTa^kWpse additional financial strains on companies.   The blame will be laifl/ar the door of the revaluation and hence the Government for any adverse i^ nsequences.   Ratepayers - including domestic ratepayers whose rate bills would be unaffected by the revaluation - might nonetheless blame the Government for any increases they face.2hief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s view is a simple one. &quot; )litical risk of a 1987 revaluation when 1989 iel   While there may be some criticism before a&apos;11.   The issue in Is it worth runnings-would be a safer alt&lt;1987 or 1988 Election^rr&amp;^/notential losers from a 1989 revaluation, he believes that this will wJ^rty much less than would come from known losers from a 1987 revaluation.^lh^d&gt; has been no revaluation since 1973.    So the question is one of convertingX^HA-year wait into a 16-year one. The Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos; s &gt;^WY^s that prudence points to 1CONCLUSION12.   By contrast we favour 1987.  ^/^kdomestic revaluation is an unpleasant necessity.   We shall inev^taMv be criticised by those ratepayers who lose from it, or can foresee that&lt;^hW&gt;will lose from it, whenever it is held.   But we shall also be critici^^^ representatives of business if we allow the revaluation to drift be$of&amp;the earliest feasible date. We can expect growing criticism from thosi/ijxlustrialists in the older industrial sector who are increasingly awafck-that their rateable values are disproportionately high.   And as we move the date back towards the end of^ the decade pressure for a full revaluation, including domestic property, will mount.13.   We cannot convincingly argue, now that rates non-domestic revaluation should be further postpone^ life of this Parliament.
