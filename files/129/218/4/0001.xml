ANNUAL REVIEW OF AGRICULTURE 1984INTRODUCTION1. This White Paper sets out the data considered during the Annual Review of the economic condition and prospects of the United Kingdom agricultural industry. The Government will draw on this information, as appropriate, when considering proposals by the European Commission for agricultural support in 1984/85 and when decisions are taken on support arrangements which remain within our national competence. As usual, these decisions will be announced separately. In most cases the forecasts for 1983 were made in November 1983.PART I STATE OF THE INDUSTRY2. Growing conditions throughout 1983 were particularly variable. Prolonged wet weather in the spring delayed turnout of livestock and the planting of crops, particularly potatoes. The very dry summer reduced yields of forage grown for cattle and sheep but aided the cereal harvest. Soil conditions in the autumn enabled rapid progress to be made with autumn sowings and facilitated the bulking-up of root crops. Gross output at constant prices, which measures in volume terms the output from agriculture, fell slightly reflecting a forecast reduction in sales of cereals, potatoes and sugar beet.3. The average prices paid for the industry&apos;s material inputs and obtained for its outputs increased by around 5%. Farming income, which measures the return to farmers and their spouses and return on own capital invested, fell by 15 %. Farm business income, a wider definition, being the sum of farming income, the returns to non-principal partners and directors and return on all capital invested, fell by about 9 %. This reduction in income follows significant rises in real terms in 1981 and 1982.4. The total area of cereals planted declined but production is estimated at 21.2 million tonnes, only 0.7 million tonnes below the record achieved in the previous year. The acreage sown to oilseed rape increased by 28% to 222,000 hectares but estimated production of 580,000 tonnes is the same as that for 1982. Potato plantings rose by 1 % but yields were much reduced. The output of field vegetables was also generally lower. The 1983 sugar beet crop is expected to yield around 1.1 million tonnes of sugar, compared with 1.4 million tonnes from the exceptionally large 1982 crop.5. Overall the national cattle breeding herd expanded by 1 % reflecting an increase in dairy cows of 2\ % and a decline in the beef breeding herd of 2%. Milk production increased by 2\%. The number of sheep rose by almost 2\% and the production of sheepmeat in 1983 is forecast to increase by about 8 % to 295,000 tonnes. Numbers of breeding pigs declined by \\% and pigmeat production in 1983 is expected to increase by almost 4 %. Layer chick placings fell sharply but increased egg yields are expected to result in production falling by only 2%. Turkey meat output is expected to rise but overall poultrymeat production is expected to be around 2\ /0 below 1982 levels.I
PART II GENERAL DEVELOPMENTSFarm structure (Table 4)6. In 1983 there were some 243,300 farm holdings in the United Kingdom. This was a reduction of 1 % on the number of farms in 1978, the decline being concentrated among the smaller full-time businesses. It is estimated that some 91 % of total output came from businesses capable of providing work for at least one full-time man and that these represent half the total number of holdings. Large businesses of 1,000 standard man-days or more, whilst only about 13% of the total number of holdings, accounted for about half the total output. In Northern Ireland and Wales, the output from small-scale farms is proportionately more significant than in other parts of the United Kingdom.7. The average area (including rough grazing) of full-time businesses of 250 standard man-days or more is now 119 hectares compared with 115 hectares in 1978. There has been a continued fall in the number of enterprises (denned as self-contained units within a holding) with the exception of sheep breeding flocks. Average enterprise sizes are generally increasing. Over the last five years the average size of dairy herds has increased by a quarter to 58 cows, although the number of herds has fallen by nearly one-fifth. In the same period the average size of breeding pig herds has increased by 40% to 41 breeding pigs whilst the number of herds has declined by 28 %. Flock sizes in the sheep sector have increased by 8% between 1978 and 1983 and the number of flocks has also increased by 6% during this period. The average beef cow herd has remained stable at 18 cows. There has been an increase in the last five years in the average area sown to cereals from 34 to 41 hectares (20 %) and an increase of 20 % in the average area of potatoes. The number of holdings growing oilseed rape has almost trebled between 1978 and 1983 and it is this rather than the increase in the average size of enterprise that has been mainly responsible for the substantial increase in the total area during this period.8. In Great Britain 69% of the holdings were wholly or mainly owner-occupied in 1983 compared with 54% in 1960/61. The proportion of agricultural land which is farmed by its owner has increased from 52% in 1960/61 to 60% in 1983. In Northern Ireland virtually all farmers are owner-occupiers.Output (Tables 22 and 24)9. Gross output is forecast to rise by  365 million (3 %) to  11,595 million in 1983 compared with a rise of  1,387 million (14%) between 1981 and 1982. The overall volume of output as measured by the index of gross output at constant 1980 prices is expected to fall(marginally to 106 in 1983 compared with a level of 107 in 1982. This decline is the result of a fall in sales of farm crops, particularly potatoes, sugar beet and cereals; the volume of output of livestock and livestock products, however, is expected to increase slightly. Overall, the price of outputs will rise by about 5% between 1982 and 1983 with increases of 12% for potatoes, 10% for horticultural products and 9% for cereals, being partly offset by falls of about 5% for fat pigs and 4% on eggs. The value of sales off farms of cereals is forecast to fall slightly, despite2
the increase in prices. This arises from the quantities sold in the autumn of 1983 being appreciably lower than in the same period of 1982 when export demand was strong. Stocks of cereals remaining on farms at the end of 1983 were nearly 1 million tonnes higher than at the end of 1982. These additional stocks are valued at cost of production in 1983; the full value of subsequent sales from them will not be reflected until 1984. Potato stocks, however, are expected to be about 0.7 million tonnes lower than at the end of 1982 due to the smaller crop. The firm prices should maintain the value of sales of potatoes in the early part of 1984 at a level significantly above that from the previous crop. Overall the value of sales off farms for all farm crops is expected to show a decline of \\% while the values of horticultural products, livestock and livestock products are expected to rise by 11%, 6 % and 3 % respectively, the latter being dominated by dairy production where both quantity and price show a slight increase.Input (Table 22)10. Gross input for 1983 is expected to rise by  429 million (7 %) compared with an increase of  659 million (13%) between 1981 and 1982. The volume of purchased inputs is estimated to increase by 2% in 1983 with much of the rise attributed to increased feedingstuffs usage. Within gross input, purchased feedingstuffs, which is the largest item of expenditure, is expected to rise by about 8% in 1983: expenditure on fuel and oil is expected to rise by 12%. The average price of bought-in goods and services increased by about 5%, with fuel and oil rising by 11%.Gross and net product (Tables 22 and 23)11. Gross product, which is gross output less gross input, is forecast to be  5,308 million in 1983, slightly less than in 1982. After allowing for depreciation on fixed assets, - net product (the measure of the value added by the agricultural industry to all goods and services purchased from outside the industry) is forecast to fall by  125 million (3%), compared with an increase of  662 million (19%) between 1981 and 1982.Aggregate income (Tables 22 and 23)12. The net product of agriculture represents the sum of various types of income. From the net product, the agricultural industry has to pay its labour force, meet the interest on outstanding debt and provide for expenditure on net rent, while also providing the return to farmers for their own labour and management.13. The net Farming Income of farmers and their spouses is the balance of net product after meeting labour costs, interest charges and net rent. In 1983, the labour bill for hired and family workers is expected to rise by  132 million (8%); and net rent, a relatively small item, by  16 million (15%). Interest payments on the other hand are expected to fall by  8 million (2%). The resulting net Farming Income for farmers and their spouses is forecast to fall by  266 million (15%) to  1,536 million in 1983. This follows the exceptional rise of  484 million (37%) in 1982. The Farming Income series in money and real terms for recent years is shown in Column (b) of Table 23.3
It should be noted that the farming income figure is the difference between the two large aggregates of output and expenditure. A small percentage change to either can generate a large proportional change in income. Additionally, the calendar year income measures cannot be simply related to that particular year&apos;s harvest, since the valuation of output includes substantial sales of cereals and potatoes carried over from the previous year&apos;s crop, and is affected also by changes in the quantity of harvested crops in store on farms at the end of each year.14. There are several other measures of the income of the industry which are more broadly based and rather less volatile than net Farming Income. For example, Farm Business Income (Column (c) of Table 23) includes, in addition to the income of farmers and their spouses, the returns to non-principal farmers and directors and the returns on all capital invested. In 1983 Farm Business Income fell by about 9%, following a rise of 27% in 1982.15. Column (d) in Table 23 is a measure of the cash flow of farmers and their spouses. This index shows the revenue accruing to farmers and spouses less cash outlays, including spending on material inputs and services and on capital items. As such, it may be close to how many farmers perceive the financial situation of the industry. Between 1982 and 1983, the cash flow is estimated to have fallen in money terms by 13%.Income developments by farm type (Tables 26 and 27)16. Information about income per farm for types and sizes of farm, based on farm accounts from samples of full-time farms, differs in coverage and accounting concepts and practices from the aggregate calculation and thus is not directly comparable with it. The accounts for 1982/83 (the year ending on average in February 1983) show increases in incomes on cropping farms and on dairy farms but falls on other livestock farms. Table 27 indicates the average levels of income earned by farm businesses of various types and sizes. Forecasts of 1983/84 results suggest further increases for cropping farms but reductions in incomes on dairy farms and most other categories of livestock farms.17. After three years of recovery from the severe fall in 1979/80, incomes on dairy farms are forecast to fall generally in 1983/84 reflecting the effects of poor weather on milk yields and little change in returns from milk. On hill and upland farms the recovery in incomes up to 1981/82 was followed by a general decline in 1982/83 and the forecast is of a further fall in 1983/84 on many farms but a sizeable increase on mainly sheep farms in Scotland and Wales. On lowland livestock farms the fairly general increase up to 1981/82 was reversed in 1982/83 and a further decrease is forecast for 1983/84 except in Scotland (where the increased value of crop output should lead to a moderate rise in income) and in Northern Ireland. Incomes on pig farms and on poultry farms fell in 1982/83 and are forecast to fall sharply in 1983/84.18. Incomes on specialist cereal farms in England showed a substantial increase in income in 1982/83, and a further small increase is forecast for4
1983/84. On other cropping farms (except those in Scotland) incomes rose in 1982/83, due to the contribution of high cereal output, and in 1983/84 incomes are expected to increase further reflecting higher potato prices.19. The overall picture shown by the farm accounts is that incomes on cropping farms continue to increase, whilst those on dairy and most other livestock farms have declined. This broad pattern of cropping incomes increasing at a greater rate than livestock incomes has held in general since 1977/78. In real terms incomes on dairy and livestock farms are substantially below the levels of the late 1970s, while cropping farms show marked improvement over the same period.Productivity (Tables 5 and 24)20. The index of output per person (gross agricultural product at constant prices per person engaged) reflects changes in, for example, plant and animal breeding and in investment in the organisation of farming, as well as the reduction in the number of persons engaged and short-term movements in output caused by factors such as weather. During the ten years to 1982 the index increased on average by about 5% annually. However, a decrease of around 3% is forecast for 1983. This reflects a decline of over 4% in gross agricultural product at constant prices more than offsetting a reduction in the number of persons engaged of between 1 % and 2 %. The number of regular whole-time workers fell by 2% between 1982 and 1983 compared with an annual average reduction of about 4% in the ten years to 1982.Gross capital formation (Table 20)21. It is estimated that the value of new investment in fixed assets will rise by 7% in 1983, to  1,341 million. Expenditure on buildings and works is forecast to be  610 million, a fall of 1% compared with the 1982 level, while that on plant, machinery and vehicles is forecast to rise by 15% to  731 million. In volume terms new investment in buildings and works is forecast to decline by about 1 % whereas that in plant, machinery and vehicles is forecast to increase by about 11 %. The forecast increase in the volume of total gross fixed capital formation is some 5%. After allowing for depreciation, the net stock of these assets is forecast to remain broadly at the level of recent years.22. The value of the physical increase in stocks and work-in-progress showed only a marginal rise in 1983 with forecast increases in farm stocks of cereals, apples and pears being largely offset by a fall in potato stocks. The volume of breeding livestock capital formation showed a significant rise in 1982 and a further smaller rise is forecast for 1983.Bank borrowings23. Total bank advances to agriculture in 1983 are forecast to average about  4,670 million, around 17% higher than the average for 1982. Part of this increase is thought to be for land purchase and part will reflect the forecast moderate increase in plant and machinery investment. Although bank borrowings have increased the rate of increase has declined slightly. The relationship between the liabilities and assets of the industry as a whole remains sound;5
information from the balance sheets of a sample of full-time farm businesses in the Farm Management Survey indicates that in England and Wales external liabilities at February 1983 represented about one-fifth of the total business assets of tenanted farms and about one-tenth of the assets of owner-occupied farms and mixed tenure farms.Agricultural land prices (Table 25)24. The consistent general upward movement of agricultural land prices shown by the comprehensive Inland Revenue series in the latter half of the 1970s has not been maintained in recent years. Since 1980 average prices have remained relatively stable with the exception of those of tenanted land in Wales where prices have fallen back until, in 1982, they were at about the levels of four to five years earlier. In 1982 the average price per hectare of land sold with vacant possession was  3,663 in England,  2,324 in Wales and  1,798 in Scotland; in Northern Ireland the 1982 price of  2,683 had risen to  2,895 during the first six months of 1983. The more up-to-date but less comprehensive Current Agricultural Land Prices series, which covers England and Wales only, indicates that the average price of vacant possession land in both countries has been rising in 1983.Farm rents (Table 25)25. The provisional results of the Annual Rent Enquiry in England and Wales, together with the continuing field surveys in Scotland, suggest that average farm rents in Great Britain will rise by 11 % in 1983. This compares with an increase of 14|% in 1982.Farm workers&apos; earnings (Table 21)26. The average weekly earnings-of whole-time hired men in the United Kingdom averaged  105.44 for 46.1 hours in the calendar year 1982 compared with  96.29 for 46.3 hours in the calendar year 1981. Average weekly earnings in 1983 are forecast to be about  114.45 for 46.1 hours. Following the increases in weekly wage rates that came into effect in January and February 1983 (paragraph 23 of the 1983 Annual Review White Paper (Cmnd. 8804)), statutory minimum weekly wage rates were increased by 5% for adult regular whole-time hired workers in England and Wales from 1 September 1983, by just over 4% for general workers in Scotland from 5 September 1983, and by 5% for agriculture workers in Northern Ireland from 10 October 1983.Public expenditure (Table 28)27. Expenditure in the United Kingdom on market regulation under the Common Agricultural Policy is estimated to be about  1,357 million in 1983/84 compared with some  1,099 million in 1982/83. This expenditure includes the butter and school milk subsidies, the beef and sheepmeat variable premium schemes, the premium schemes for the non-marketing of milk and for the conversion of dairy herds, the suckler cow premium scheme, the annual premium on ewes, export refunds and the cost of purchasing commodities into intervention less proceeds from sales. It also includes a variety of other grants and subsidies.   Some of this expenditure benefits consumers and trade interests6
rather than producers. Receipts from the milk co-responsibility levy, export charges equivalent to the premia on sheepmeat (known as &quot;clawback&quot;) and levies on intra-community trade have been netted off against this expenditure. The additional expenditure in 1983/84 is mainly due to increased purchases into intervention of beef, butter and skimmed milk powder and to increased payments on liquid skimmed milk used for animal feeds, the beef premium scheme and the annual premium on ewes. These increases are partly offset by reduced net expenditure on cereals intervention.28. Expenditure in the United Kingdom on price guarantees, capital grants and support for agriculture in special areas (excluding Brucellosis incentives and horticultural protected crops adaptation aid) is estimated to be  332 million in 1983/84 compared with  334 million in 1982/83.PART III COMMODITY TRENDSCereals (Tables 3, 6, 8 and 29)29. In 1983 cereals were grown on 3.97 million hectares, a net reduction of 65,000 hectares over 1982. An increase of 28,000 hectares in the area sown to wheat was more than offset by a fall of some 93,000 hectares in the barley and oats area. The yield of wheat in the 1983 harvest was better than in 1982 and that of barley slightly worse. The average quality was not quite as high, and there was a sharp drop in plantings of good quality milling wheats. Production of all cereals reached about 21.2 million tonnes second only to the record harvest of 21.9 million tonnes in 1982.30. Market prices began to strengthen in January 1983, following the low prices in the first part of the season and heavy sales particularly for export and into intervention. For wheat, the increase was especially marked, and prices for feed wheat in particular reached very high levels by mid-March which persisted until new crop supplies became available. Some 300,000 tonnes of wheat and barley were sold out of intervention on to the domestic market during this period. Market prices fell at the start of the new season but were higher relative to support levels than in recent years, and sales into intervention have so far been much lower than last season. Offers of barley into intervention almost ceased after September and total purchases had reached only about 310,000 tonnes by end-December. Offers of bread wheat in the August-October intervention period totalled just under 67,000 tonnes which was abated to 24,500 tonnes under the special monthly quota arrangements introduced by the Commission to ensure that the total quantity bought into intervention in the Community did not exceed 3 million tonnes. Prices strengthened during August and September but have fallen somewhat since then. Export demand has been well below the level of last season. The gap between feed wheat and feed barley prices has been narrower than usual. The sowing of winter cereals took place in ideal conditions and a record area has been established.7
Oilseed rape (Tables 3, 6, 9 and 29)31. The area sown with oilseed rape in 1983 increased by 28% to 222,000 hectares. Average yields were below those expected at about 2.6 tonnes per hectare, mainly due to difficult weather conditions, but production forecast at 580,000 tonnes is close to 1982&apos;s record level. A further increase in the area sown for the 1984 crop is forecast and, assuming normal yields, production should rise steeply. Market prices in 1983 were firm and farmers&apos; returns are likely to have been well above the intervention price.Potatoes (Tables 3, 6, 10 and 29)32. Plantings in 1983 were some 3,700 hectares more than the United Kingdom target area of 191,300 hectares. However, the crop was adversely affected by the wet spring which delayed plantings, and by the dry summer which hindered growth and, to some extent impaired quality. As a result yields were well down on last season&apos;s record levels despite the mild autumn which generally favoured late tuber growth and late lifting. Production was therefore notably lower than last year, while prices were significantly higher. The Potato Marketing Board was again authorised to offer contracts pre-season to producers in Great Britain for a proportion of their crop with the aim of ensuring stability in the market throughout the season. In the face of shortage anticipated in trade circles and high Futures Market prices, only some 126,000 tonnes of potatoes were placed under contract in this way.33. Discussions on future support and marketing arrangements are continuing.Sugar beet (Tables 3, 6, 11 and 29)34. In 1983 British Sugar pic contracted to purchase sugar beet from about 206,000 hectares, slightly more than in 1982, but with very unfavourable weather at sowing time and during the early part of the season, the harvested area fell to about 196,000 hectares compared with 201,000 hectares the previous year. Later in the season the weather improved and white sugar production is forecast to be 1.1 million tonnes compared with the record 1.4 million tonnes in 1982. Including the 80,000 tonnes of &quot;C&quot; sugar carried forward from the previous marketing year, this would mean that the total outturn would exceed the maximum quota of 1.144 million tonnes set for the United Kingdom under the Community sugar regime. The excess has to be exported without export refunds or carried forward to the next quota year.Horticulture (Tables 3, 6, 12 and 29)35. It is not practicable to deal individually with the whole range of horticultural crops grown commercially in the United Kingdom. These paragraphs concentrate on certain crops in significant production here including those subject to Community internal market arrangements (apples, pears, cauliflowers and tomatoes).8
36. The area devoted to horticulture in 1983 was about 220,000 hectares but this cannot be directly compared with last year&apos;s area of 254,000 hectares because the definition of horticulture used for census returns has been changed.37. Production of apples in the 1983 growing season was about average, following the large crop in 1982, but production of pears in 1983 was substantially higher than last year. Soft fruit production generally was slightly up on last year. While the wet spring and dry summer affected yields of strawberries, there was a heavy crop of blackcurrants. Perishability in the hot summer caused some marketing problems.38. The wet spring followed by the hot dry summer caused reduced yields of field vegetables compared with recent years. The autumn and winter crops benefited from better growing conditions in September and October and supplies generally are expected to be adequate to meet demand. After a series of difficult years, glasshouse salad crops had a better year in 1983. While there was continuing strong competition from imports, the hot summer resulted in a buoyant demand for salads. Government aid to help growers of protected crops meet the increased costs of heating oil was extended, at an additional cost of  1 million, to 31 March 1983 by when the preferential gas tariff to Dutch growers was phased out. To encourage growers to make better use of energy in glasshouse heating the Government is providing substantially increased grants for investments in energy saving facilities. This additional assistance will be worth about  2 million per year to the heated glasshouse industry.39. Abundant supplies of apples from the 1982 crop kept prices low in early 1983 but with an average production in 1983, both in the United Kingdom and in Europe, prices increased from August onwards. Withdrawals of 1983 season apples are expected to be low although withdrawals of pears could be greater than in 1982. While cauliflower prices were below 1982 levels for much of the early part of the year, prices rose as the dry conditions of early summer affected the quantity of produce available and remained higher in the autumn. Withdrawals of the 1983 crop have been well below the high 1982 levels. Tomato prices were higher than for previous years until the end of August when for a time they fell below 1982 levels and some withdrawals took place. Demand for cut flowers was generally static. Despite increased competition from Dutch and Channel Islands supplies, prices were usually above the previous year&apos;s levels, except during the summer months when they fell due to lack of demand.Hops (Tables 3, 6, 13 and 29)40. The area under hops was slightly reduced from 1982. Production was considerably lower but more than enough to meet contracts. The quality of the crop was good and average prices again increased.Seeds (Table 14)41. The area approved in 1983 for production of certified herbage and legume seed (excluding field bean and field pea seed) was about the same as9
in 1982. Yields were average but quality was good. Stocks of herbage seed were higher than in the previous year. Growers&apos; prices showed little change.42. As foreseen, the area approved for certified field bean and field pea seed production dropped considerably. Stocks were lower but in general supplies are adequate to meet requirements. In 1984, when Community seed production aid ceases, there is likely to be a further fall in production of certified seed of these species.Dried peas and beans43. The area sown with peas in 1983 was 47,000 hectares. 1983 yields are estimated at 3.05 tonnes per hectare. These figures cannot be directly compared with those for 1982, because peas for stock feeding were previously included with other stock feeding crops in the June Census returns and therefore could not be separately identified and included in the total United Kingdom pea crop. The area sown with beans in 1983 was 33,300 hectares, a fall of 16% compared with 1982. 1983 yields are estimated at 3.25 tonnes per hectare, compared with a final figure of 3.07 tonnes for 1982.44. Prices for peas and beans have generally been at, or above, the minimum level necessary to enable compounders to qualify for aid under the Community regime.Beef and milk (Tables 3, 6, 15, 16, 17 and 29)45. The June Census showed a modest increase in the total United Kingdom cattle breeding herd compared with the previous year. The size of the United Kingdom beef breeding herd fell by about 2% while the dairy herd, which accounts for about 70% of all breeding cows, increased by 2i%. Within the national dairy herd there was a somewhat larger increase in Northern Ireland of 5 %. In Scotland the 3 % increase continues the growth observed last year after several years of very little change as does the 2% increase in Wales.46. Home-fed production of beef in 1983 is expected to be about 6% higher than in 1982 with exports increasing by about 35 % and imports by about 2%. Total new supplies for home consumption at 1.066 million tonnes are forecast to be 1^% above 1982 levels. Average market prices for certified cattle were around 94p/live kg for the first few months of the year rising to 106p/live kg at the end of May and then declining seasonally to 94p/live kg again at the end of September, remaining at this level throughout October. Variable premiums have been paid at, or close to, the maximum level of 10.759p/live kg for most of the year, except May and June when they averaged about 5.2p/live kg. Total intervention purchases between 1 January 1983 and 31 October 1983 were 15,000 tonnes, representing a little over 1% of forecast total supplies. About two-thirds of intervention purchases took place in Northern Ireland.47. The average yield of milk per cow in 1983 is expected to be only slightly higher than in 1982. However, because of the increase in size of the national dairy herd, total milk production is expected to increase by about 21% for the year as a whole. The amount of milk sold for liquid consumption10
in 1983 is expected to fall by about I %. This together with the rise in total production, is expected to result in an increase of nearly 6% in the volume of milk available for manufacturing. Milk used for cheese production in 1983 is expected to decrease very slightly, but milk used for butter production is expected to increase by almost 12%.48. Producer returns for milk are determined by the Milk Marketing Boards on the basis of their returns from the liquid and manufacturing milk markets. The five Boards&apos; average net returns from all milk for the 1983/84 year are expected to be between 16.0 ppl and 16.2 ppl with net returns to the England and Wales Board being between 16.0 ppl and 16.2 ppl and those to the Northern Ireland Board about 15.3 ppl. In Scotland net returns from all milk vary slightly between the three Board areas but are expected to average between 16.2 ppl and 16.5 ppl.Sheep and woo! (Tables 3, 15, 19 and 29)49. The breeding flock increased by 2\% between June 1982 and June 1983, a slightly lower increase than the previous year.50. Home-fed production of sheepmeat at 295,000 tonnes is forecast to be nearly 8% higher in 1983 following another good lambing season. Total supplies to the home market are forecast to fall in 1983 by about 7% resulting from a reduction in imports of 21 % and a rise in exports of 15%. Market prices in Great Britain have on average been just below those of 1982. In Northern Ireland prices have been a little higher than the previous year. Sheep variable premium was paid in Great Britain in every week of the year with the exception of one week in mid-May. Annual premium payments relating to the 1982/83 marketing year amounted to  2.73 per ewe in Great Britain and to  9.58 per ewe in Northern Ireland where the variable premium is not payable. Overall the average prices for store lambs and draft ewes continued to rise with the most significant increases in Northern Ireland reversing the fall of the previous year.51. Wool production in 1983 is forecast to be about 4% above the 1982 level. The guaranteed price remained unchanged but final payments to producers are forecast to be slightly higher than in 1982 because of savings made in the marketing costs of the British Wool Marketing Board. The average market price for the 1983 clip is forecast to remain below the guaranteed price. Exchequer advances to the Board have continued.Pigs (Tables 3, 15 and 29)52. Pigmeat production in 1983 is forecast to be about 1.01 million tonnes, nearly 4Jr% above the 1982 level. Prices at the beginning of 1983 were below 1982 levels. They fell sharply in the first quarter and remained below 1982 levels until September. Prices overall averaged 4% below 1982 prices. A decline in production is expected in 1984 reflecting a fall in the breeding herd.Poultrymeat (Tables 3, 15 and 29)53. Output in 1983 at 787,000 tonnes is forecast to be 2}% below the level11
of the previous year. This reflects a 4 % reduction in broiler meat production and an increase in turkey meat of 5 %. A further slight fall is forecast for 1984. Both imports and exports have been higher in 1983. Prices of chickens have increased slightly but turkey prices are below the 1982 level.Eggs (Tables 3, 6, 18 and 29)54. Layer chick placings have fallen in 1983 and the total laying flock is forecast to show a 3% decrease, with a similar reduction forecast for 1984. It is forecast that yield will have increased by about two eggs per bird per annum in line with the long term trend. There will be more imports but supplies of eggs for consumption will be 1 % lower than in 1982. Prices of eggs have been low and the average for the year is forecast to be beneath the level of the previous two years.12
APPENDIXSTATISTICAL TABLESThe tables cover largely the same ground as those in last year&apos;s White Paper except that:(a) two new Tables (Nos. 23 and 24) present the information formerly included in Table 23 (Income, net product and labour productivity) in a more comprehensive way;(6) two new Tables (Nos. 26 and 27) present the information formerly included in Table 25 (Farm accounts: net incomes for different types of farm) in a more comprehensive way;(c) a new base year, 1980, has been introduced in those tables presenting indices, and for the constant price series, presented in Table 20;(d) two graphs have been included based on Table 23 showing economic indicators at current prices and in real terms.Where there has been no change in the basis of the tables, some of the figures in this appendix differ from those in previous Annual Review White Papers because of later information, changes in the scope and nature of available data and improvements in statistical methods. In particular, some of the figures for 1981 have been revised more than would usually be expected in order to incorporate final Overseas Trade Statistics which were not available at the time of completion of the tables last year. The forecasts for 1983 generally reflect the position up to the end of the year, as seen at November 1983.All figures relate to the Uniled Kingdom, unless otherwise stated.Figures for imports and exports to the Nine relate throughout to the other countries of the European Community (Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Greece, the Irish Republic, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands).Significant items of Channel Islands trade are shown separately in the tables. Figures for exports include re-exports.In some cases figures may not add up to the totals shown because of roundings.Symbols:  means &quot;nil&quot;... means &quot;negligible&quot; (less than half the last digit shown) .. means &quot;not available&quot; or &quot;not applicable&quot;.13

Table 3 (continued)(a) The data in this tabic vary between the different countries as follows: England and Wales: For all years the figures relate to all known agricultural holdings including minor holdings (previously called statistically insignificant holdings).Scotland: The figures for 1972 relate to agricultural holdings with a labour requirement of 26 standard man-days or more. (A standard man-day (smd) represents 8 hours&apos; productive work by an adult worker under average conditions.) The raising of the threshold from 26 to 40 smd in 1973 resulted in the exclusion of some 5 000 minor holdings and in 1977 a further 1 700 holdings were excluded. Since then the Scottish figures relate to ull known agricultural holdings with 40 smd or more.Northern Ireland: The figures for 1972 relate to holdings of 0.4 hectares (one acre) or more and in the case of livestock to all owners of livestock. From 1973 to 1980 the figures relate to all holdings with (i) 40 smd or more, or (ii) 4 hectares or more of total area, or (iii) one or more regular full-time workers (excluding the owner). The change between 1972 and 1973 resulted in the net deletion of some 6 000 holdings. The figures for 1981 onwards relate to all holdings with: (i) one European Size Unit (ESU) or more (see footnote (f) to Tabic 25), or (ii) 6 hectares or more of total urea, or (iii) one or more full-time workers (excluding the owner). This change between 1980 and 1981 resulted in the deletion of a further 7 000 holdings but their exclusion has had an insignificant effect on the cropping and stocking figures.(b) Cereals for threshing, excluding maize.(c) Collected separately in Scotland from 1982.((/) Includes small area of soft fruit grown under orchard trees in England and Wales. (e) Hardy nursery stock, bulbs and flowers.(/) Most of the difference between total horticultural area and the sum of individual sectors is made up by the glasshouse area.(g) Includes nrca of other crops and bare fallow not shown in the table.(/;) Includes lucerne.(/)  Before 1975 collected as:In England and Wales &quot;clover, sainfoin and temporary grasses&quot;; In Scotland  &quot;grass under 7 years old&quot;;In Northern Ireland   &quot;grass Ist, 2nd and 3rd year&quot;.CO  Before 1975 collected as:In England and Wales &quot;permanent grass&quot;;In Scotland  &quot;grass 7 years old and over&quot;;In Northern Ireland    &quot;grass 4th year or older&quot;.(k) Returns of &quot;other land&quot; were collected for the first time in England and Wales in June 1969. From June 1969 to June 1973 &quot;other land&quot; in Great Britain was collected as woodland and areas under roads, yards, buildings, etc., the use of which was ancillary to farming of the land; in Northern Ireland it included land within agricultural holdings which was under bog, water, roads, buildings, etc., and waste land not used for agriculture. In June 1974 the definition was changed in England and Wales to include all other land forming part of the holding and in Scotland it was extended to include ponds and derelict land.

The figures for 1978 have been adjusted to take account of the reappraisal of minor holdings in England and Wales which resulted in a further 11 000 holdings being removed from the June 1980 Census. The removal of some 7 000 such holdings from the census in Northern Ireland between June 1980 and June 1981 (see note (n) to Table 3) has no significant effect on this Table. The Northern Ireland figures in the first two sections of the Table include only holdings with 50 smd or more which were only slightly affected by the change, as were the quantities of crops and stock in the other sections of the Table. The decline in the total number of holdings is reflected in the smallest size group and has marginally increased the average size of some enterprises.Caution must be exercised in comparing these figures with those quoted in recent White Papers and in particular with figures in White Papers published prior to the 1978 Review when results were based on imperial measurements and old smd values.(A) The average size of holdings based on total area was:1978 71.1 hectares of which 67.8% was under crops and grass. 1983   71.6 hectares of which 68.3% was under crops and grass.(c) These figures include holdings with no crops and grass which are excluded from the first section of the Table.(//) With the introduction of revised smd values for the 1978 Annual Review the figures shown in this Table are only comparable with those in the White Papers for 1978 onwards (but see note ( ) above).(c)  Figures relate to England and Wales only.(/) Figures included for Scotland relate to December Censuses in 1977 and 1982 and for Northern Ireland to the December 1977 and June 1983 Censuses.(g) Figures included for Northern Ireland relate to pig holdings which had fattening pigs only.(/i) Figures for Scotland and Northern Ireland include small numbers of other table fowls.20

Wives/husbands of farmers, partners and directors engaged in farm work were returned separately in 1977.

In addition, the series shown for Scotland refer to equipped farms only and exclude sales of unequipped land, whole estates, land sold for afforestation and inter-family sales. There is a delay between the date on which a sale is agreed and the date on which it is included in the series. The delay is thought to average about 6-9 months in England and Wales and about 3 months in Northern Ireland. The average prices shown in the table for each calendar year relate to sales included in the series for these countries in the years ending in the following September and March respectively. In the case of Scotland, the problem is overcome by further analysis of information by date of sale. The data for Scotland and Northern Ireland are subject to retrospective revision.(c) The Indices of average rents for England and Wales are based on an annual rent enquiry and for Scotland on continuing field surveys.   In Northern Irelund very little land is rented except under the conacre system.43

More detailed figures for England will be published in &quot;Farm incomes ir England 1982/83&quot;, for Scotland in &quot;Economic Report on Scottish Agriculture 1983&quot;, for Wales in &quot;Farrr Accounts in Wales 1982/83&quot; and for Northern Ireland in a publication by the Department of Agriculture foi Northern Ireland.   The index numbers scries are provisional.(b) Net income is the return to the farmer and spouse for their manual and managerial labour and the return or tenant-type capital in crops, livestock, machinery, etc,, but excluding land and buildings. It is calculated before deduction of interest on any farming loans. All farms arc treated as rented and an imputed rcnta value for owner-occupied land is charged as an expense in the accounts. (In Northern Ireland, as rent? cannot be imputed with reference to tenanted farms, rental charges for owned land and buildings are assessed in relation to estimated sale value.) Stocks of crops and livestock on farms at the beginning and end of the accounting year are valued at current market prices and net income includes stock appreciation except thai arising on breeding cattle, sheep and pigs. The accounts relate mainly to calendar years or years ending 5 April and the average year-ending date is about mid-February.(r) The forecast indices shown for 1983/84 are estimates by the Agriculture Departments based on past survey results and on data from the agriculture census, market reports and aggregate farm income calculations. The indices should be regarded only as broad indications of possible income developments assuming normal weather conditions between November and the close of the average accounting year in February.M) Indices in real terms arc those at current prices deflated by the Retail Price Index.(&lt;?) &quot;LFA cattle and sheep&quot; includes &quot;cattle and sheep&quot; in all countries, &quot;mainly sheep&quot; in Scotland and Wales and &quot;mainly cattle&quot; and &quot;LFA with arable&quot; in Scotland. &quot;Lowland cattle and sheep&quot; includes &quot;cropping cattle and sheep&quot;.44

Expenditure on agriculture in Northern Ireland, borne on the Northern Ireland Consolidated Fund, is also excluded. It does, however, include some expenditure which benefits consumers and trade interests rather than producers. The figures for years up to and including 1982/83 represent actual expenditure recorded in the Appropriation Accounts.   The figures for 1983/84 are the latest estimates of expenditure.(6) Expenditure in 1979/80 includes payments which were due in 1978/79 but were delayed by industrial action.(c) The figures are made up of several elements and include refunds on intra-Community trade, import and export refunds on third country trade, the beef and sheep variable premium schemes (net of claw back for sheepmeat), aid for private storage and animal feed, certain other marketing and production subsidies and the cost of purchasing commodities into intervention less proceeds from sales. The figures also take account of other receipts treated as negative expenditure, namely monetary compensatory amounts levied on Intra-Community trade and the co-responsibility levy on milk producers. The figures include the EC butter subsidy and the United Kingdom share of the EC school milk subsidy scheme.(d) Includes eggs, poultrymeat, fruit and vegetables, hops, herbage seeds, dried fodder, peas and beans, fisheries, flax and aid to beekeepers. Also includes expenditure on products covered by the CAP but not produced to any significant extent in the United Kingdom (olive oil, rice, wine, grapemust and hemp).(e) Price guarantee arrangements for sheep were superseded by the EC shcepmeat regime on 20 October 1980.(/) Payments in respect of wool and potatoes relate partly to the clip or crop of the year indicated and partly to the clip or crop, jn the preceding year or years.(g) Includes the Farm and Horticulture Development Scheme.(It) Farmers in special areas are also eligible for additional assistance under the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Scheme, Northern Ireland Agricultural Development Programme and the Agriculture and Horticulture Grant Schemes.   The estimated benefit is shown separately in Section IV of the table.(j)  Includes the Farm and Horticulture Capital Grant Schemes.(k) Includes grants in respect of investment on loan guarantees*, farm structure loans, producer organisations*, agricultural drainage* and milk pasteurisation equipment*.(Provision for the schemes marked * was included in the 1983/84 Supply Estimates.)(/) The receipts from the Guidance Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund do not relate to expenditure incurred during the financial year but mainly to expenditure incurred in the calendar year preceding the financial year.On) Includes grants for rural roads, forage groups*, integrated development programme for Western Isles*, producers in the Scottish Islands* and crofting improvements*.
