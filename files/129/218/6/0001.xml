ThisS R0t only thalso the atnount of tax which is collected for given rates and allowances, but^oiTotoi n  * taxation associated with given paths of public expenditure andw&quot;ig.  por t,8row by ^ st five years of the projections, to 1988-89, GDP is assumed toS* V(&apos; dovv      6ra^e ^lYo per annum. Thereafter, there are two factors pointing to some Pe* annUQ) t ^ 8rowth rate: the North Sea sector will by then be contributing minus }% ^an in tL     total GDP growth; and the growth of the labour supply will be somewhat less he firs* half of the decade.&apos; Thebringillg dow        rate after !988-89 will depend in part on the success of policy inC0!Jsirier tw   4116 Sllare oi Public expenditure and the burden of taxation. Accordingly wePer       Cases-  In the first, total GDP grows by 2% per annum, equivalent to about annum f^eri d&gt; and         r tlle non-North Sea sector. This is about the average for the post-war 41 li% =     lgniflcantly better than the last decade. In the second case total GDP grows 1501,6 likely    &apos;  qUlValent to about 2% for the non-North Sea sector.   Higher growth is greater the reduction in the tax burden.The pa^ Jth Sea ta      ^0rtk ^ea tax revenues has an important bearing on the burden of non-&apos;S  f ^ey iin l0n* A*&gt;art ^om the profile of production, the behaviour of real oil prices real i       P rtance   t+  terms *v * ls assumed here that after falling over the next two years or so in de &apos; they fiattbt o n then start to rise again as the balance of supply andm  but pr gressively tighter.
