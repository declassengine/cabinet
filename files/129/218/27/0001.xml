CONFIDENTIALTho Edwards Committee report*1* of 1969 set the pattern for Britain&apos;sineindustry   over   the   last   decade.     The  Committee  supported theProent of a competitive multi-airline  industry as  the best way to,Seet consumer needs.     Its conclusions are as valid today,  as demand hasbecome  more  varied.     There  is  now a wide  range  of efficientServar e   and   small,   with which  airlines  of all  sizes  can offerices +-meet demand of all kinds.Thhoie  benefits  of competition  are  evident.

The Authority will remainain regulator of the civil tPrair transport industry and therefore the&quot;inoilPal bulthwark against airlines acting in a predatory fashion towardsPre 0mPetitors.     However,   the Government  is satisfied the Authority adv h-as    sufficient   powers    to    act   against   anti-competitive and nedatory ibehaviour  in  the  industry.     Through the licensing system, the Auth rity can attach appropriate conditions to an air transport licence inthe tinterest *OLt&gt;  of users.    It can refuse lower prices to an airline where y c*n be cshown to be predatory; increase prices which are being frozen,gardiess offrrising costs, with predatory intent;  and cut back capacity C1Uencies designed to force out rival airlines.

After very careful aetation the Government has concluded it is neither necessary Slrable for the Authorities to be given a duty to promotethe und development of a competitive British airline industry. ^s this White Paper has made clear, the Government believesit isln the consumer&apos;s interest to ensure there are a number of nt and profitable British airlines strong enough to competeWith ech other directly or indirectly where the opportunity occurs, lVe of whether there is a competing foreign airline.

AnAppeals from a licensing decision by the Authority are teimined by the Secretary of State for Transport. Althoughmu.st recognise that the Authority has primary responsibilityf r licensing decisions, he will consider each case referred to himls way on its merits.

Nevertheless, he may form his own judgementon ^merits of the issues facing the Authority in the light of hisPonsibilities and against the background of this Whitene will not lightly substitute his own judgement for thatAuthority, but the Secretary of State is free to do so wherelstently with the statute, there is in his opinion a 8ubstantisiAd-i- reason for directing the Authority to reverse or vary*nY ofits decisionsAirports policy34The p-ii,- tiV11 Aviation Authority recommended that the Government %w itsa,^ airports policy, particularly in order to give airlinesqq      ^ rtunities of using Heathrow for domestic services.
