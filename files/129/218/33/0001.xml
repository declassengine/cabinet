It is an illusion to think that the P&quot;v_^ Probably ever will, cater for all new households. The is now rising at the historically very high rate of 19U, Partly to the high birth rate in the fifties and sixties households will, of course, look to the private sector wnic 120,000-130,000 houses a year.   But about 30 per cent of al are unable to afford owner-occupation whatever happens to ince and whatever the output of the private sector.    Othershave spe which the private sector simply does not cater for.    The privau continues to decline.

confidential ^ould justify a figure of 75,000 new starts a year.   Iam prepared to ifend 40,000; misc 106&apos;s proposals would mean only 19,000 starts or ;s.    This would mean a massive reduction in the work of the voluntary ;ing sector as well as local authorities and would be so plainlyite to the problems they are trying to cope with.    The level of  ts under each proposal is shown in the graph at Annex A.4.     Zjp&amp;S&amp;cope for bringing vacant dwellings into use needs to be seen in peVsp* &lt;M.ve; the average vacancy rate in the local authority sector is 2.3&lt;jfer^ent lower than in any other sector.   Of the 25,000 dwellings vacant ftf^JgjlPe than a year, about two-thirds are undergoing or awaiting improvemen^yand^repair.    I am considering urgently   fresh initiatives to bring pr^^dre on authorities either to let or sell long-term vacant dwellings,    Bof lack of money for repairs, as well as bad management, is a significant cause of the problem; many vacancies occur in defective dwellings which need substantial renovation before they can be let.RENOVATION AND REP.LOCAL AUTHORITY DWELLINGS5.

I am already giving e sector to help with renovation for er Court depend on the Urban big cuts in that programme.6.     I cannot accept the argument tha&lt;/tT fce is room for offsetting reductions in &quot;ordinary&quot; public sector ^gfawition work.   Local authorities are already having to divert resources t^Sective dwellings to the maximum extent possible.   An indication oiU^i is that they were proposing to spend  160 million in 1984-85 on such dialings and their projected expenditure for 1985-86 was  300 million.   wV already know that the total repair bill for prefabricated reinforced concrete (PRC) dwellings alone is of the order of  1.5 billion.   MISC 106 suggest&gt;fcat resources for this task could largely be found within the existing baVeltye for repair work: bnt this would mean an additional 30,000 other pubtfatKShwned dwellings a year would fall into a dilapidated state - and some ^uLAjcease to be habitable - because of the need to concentrate resourte^ifl defective system-built houses.IMPROVEMENT AND   REPAIRS GRANTSIn the private sector there is an unresolved difference between the Chief Secretary, Treasury and myself.    I do not be] we can confine home improvement grants, as the MISC 106 proposal  nly to dwellings which do not meet basic standards.    In 1981, 2i owner-occupied dwellings in England needed at least  2,500 of repaiv Yet the gross incomes of two-thirds of the households affected were 1&lt; than  80 a week (when average earnings were  120).   Grants are neededconfidential350
to prevent the private housing stock deteriorating more rapidly than it is, and to enable poor and often elderly people to live in decent conditions.    The Home and Social Affairs Committee have agreed my roposals to concentrate the grants more effectively on people in need, even with better targeting,  600 million a year would be needed to int a further deterioration in the stock,    I am prepared to stickpresent baseline of  450 million for the time being. Politically, :e the improvement programme, as MISC 106 propose, to a quarter of 1t&amp;Csf?tpptwo years ago would be fiercely criticised not least by our own suppo fe r \f or whom this has been seen as a cost-effective and worthwhile ProgramHj^Tv-It would involve a moratorium throughout 1985-86 on new approvals/pf^improvement and repair grants (other than mandatory grants) .

However it is the net line which scores in the Public  ^penditure Survey, and for 1985-86 my bid is more than offset by the  *itional  300 million of receipts which will be produced by our right  -y policy.
