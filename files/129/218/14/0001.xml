This policy becomesthe more important at just those times when difficulties in East/Westremake it hardest to pursue. Alliance Ministers recognised this when, end of their December 1983 meeting, they instructed NATO Ambassadors &quot;to undertake a thorough reappraisal of East-West relations with a vatthejointiytoweachieving a more constructive East-West dialogue&quot;.   For our part, it clear that the Government is determined to continue to work for progress in arms control and a better understanding with the Soviet and the countries of Eastern Europe.

But i  doing so the Alliance stressed that it was willing to agree tolimits onntuabased long-range INF missiles.    Indeed in the INF negotiations which evebegan in Geneva in 1981, the United States, with the full support of cneAlliance, made it clear that the cruise and Pershing deployments need-calledbegin if the Soviet Union was prepared to remove its SS20s - the so&quot;zero option&quot;.
