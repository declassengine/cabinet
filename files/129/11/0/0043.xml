REMISSION C? NON-EUROPEAN PERSONNEL&apos; INTOTHEL ARMED FORCES OP THE ^IJE^KINGjDpMMemorandum by the First Lord of the admiralty strongly support the Memorandum circulated bythe Secretory of State for V/ar in CP. (ho) 271.      There is little to add except to say that the reasons given for maintaining pre-war practice apply with even greater force to the Royal Navy.2. Officers and ratings spend much of their time in ships where living conditions ore often uncomfortable and very restricted.      For men thus brought together in confinedliving spaces there is on undeniable reaction against thepresence of other races.      Even in normal circumstances muchtolerance and mutual respect are required to establish thecontentment and discipline which are necessary for an efficient service.      Life afloat entails a sacrifice of privacyand the acceptance of an intimacy which have no counterpartin shore life.      It would be far more difficult successfullyto absorb coloured officers and men into H.M.  Ships than itwould   be to absorb them into a land based Service.3. The welfare of the Royal Navy is planned on thebasis that the United Kingdom is &quot;home&quot;.      For instance allsailors hove a right to expect to spend some part of their time within reach of their families.      It is for this reason that the balance between the time spent at sea and the time spent on shore is kept well in mind &quot;by the Admiralty.      Itdoes not follow because a non-European was living in the UnitedKingdom at the time of his enlistment that his family andconnections would be    here.      The opposite is more likely.It would not then be possible under the existing schemes ofnaval drafting for him to be given enough time with thisfamily for his own well-being.      Preferential treatment wouldbe impracticable.h* The Royal Navy is more liable than the other two services to come into contact with the Dominions and withother countries.      In many places the presence of non-Europeansin the complement of one of H.M. Ships, especially as officers,would be in the highest degree embarrassing for the Service,for the individual and for the authorities on the other side.For instance, it would be particularly embarrassing whenH.M. Ships were visiting South African ports.5. An additional complication is the decision to continuethe Women&apos;s Services on a permanent basis.     Difficulties mightwell arise in naval establishments in this country.      I do not* think that the possibility that they might be under the authorityof non-European officers would encourage women to join theW.R.N.S.(THIS DOCUMENTS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 8 GOVERNMENT)IXS-K-JJ COPY NO. 6CP.

6. One point I wish to emphasise.      It would be clangorousand short-sighted to depart from the pre-war position by admittingthe principle that no racial discrimination should be appliedto entries into the U.K.  armed forces and then to avoid theapplication of the principle by administrative action.      sooner or later this would become apparent and the charge of hypocrisywould be added to  that of unfair discrimination.      It wouldbe almost as dangerous to appear to constrict the applicationof the principle by administrative action;    for if figures were produced showing that a high proportion of non-Europeancandidates had been unsuccessful it might not be entirelyconvincing to reply that in all cases they were below thestandard for Europeans.7. Paragraph 6 of CP. (US) 278 argues that the local defence forces do not offer sufficient outlet for non-Europeanswho wish to follow a military career, but in paragraph 5 itis suggested that successful applications for admission to theUnited Kingdom Forces would be only &quot;a handful&quot;.      In viewof our manpower position),  I should have thought that thesolution to this quest i on wo. s tj lightly to enlarge the colonial forces, rather than&apos; to open up this contentious matter of admitting men of colour to the United Kingdom Forces.-A.V.A.Admi ral ty, S.,/. 1 . ,23ru July,  19h7.-2-
