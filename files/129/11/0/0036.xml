(i)    Minute of 19th July from the Minister of food to the prime MinisterPRIME minister received the attached telegram from the BritishPood Mission in Washington giving us the Canadian Wheat Board&apos;soutlined programme of shipments of wheat to this country month by month from the present date to July 31st,  19L76      this telegram was received after yesterday&apos;s Cabinet meeting,      i feel that it contains information which, even at this latehour,  it is my duty to lay before you,.The  statisticians.of this Ministry have examined theeffect of deliveries from Canada under this programme on our immediate stock position.      This new programme  (and otherimprovements in the position) raises our estimate for burstocks at the 31st August next - our danger point - from513,000 tons to 59h,000 tons and to 693? 000 tons,,, instead of590,000 tons, at September 30th,      This means (with flour)roughly 8-g- Weeks&apos;  supply at August 31 st and 9f weeks&apos; supply-on September 30th.I am now,  therefore,  in a position to give the assurance - which 1 could not give at yesterday&apos;s Cabinet -that the improved Canadian crop prospects have directly affected even our short-term situation, at our low dangerpoint in August.      (What has happened apparently is that the mere prospect of the massive new crop has induced the Canadianfarmers to part with some more of the last of their carry-over of the old crop.      We had hoped all-along that this might happen, but had no assurance of it till now),I am bound to say that in view of these figuresI can advise you that the introduction of rationing could besafely suspended.I am well aware of the physical and psychologicaldifficulties of any change of policy at this late hour.But against this the following consideration arises,.      I think there is now little risk of organised opposition from thebakers.      (And this in itself will make it more difficult for it to be said that the Government has yielded to their threat)..What I do fear greatly is the inefficiency and ill-will ofa large section of the bakery trade which,  though it willwork the scheme, will work it so badly that great inconvenience,with long hours of queueing,  will be inflicted on the unfortunate housewives of this country.      If the extraordinaryimprovement in the supply position had not occurred it would,of course, have been essentis.1 to go through with the rationing scheme in spite of this.      But it seems verydifficult to inflict all this inconvenience,  if not worse than inconvenience, without having any real necessity todo so.There remains the point which you made so forciblyabout the weakening of our international position if we shouldnot introduce bread rationing,  in the sense that we shouldweaken our hand in demanding that the Americans should infuture take-care of the needs of the British Zone in Germany.That is undeniable..     On the other hand,  the general wheatsituation appears to be improving so rapidly, not only inregard to the Canadian crop but all over the world,  that i cannot but think that the feeding of the German Zone is likelyto be a much easier problem that it appeared even a week or soago.

I am sorry to re-open this whole question again,hut I feel that on an issue of this magnitude you must at any rate have all the latest facts before you.I have sent a copy of this minute to theLord President,  the Foreign Secretary and theChancellor of the Exchequer.J. b.19th July,   1946,COPY OF CABLE PROM BRITISH FOOD MISSION,WASHINGTON, DATED 17TH&apos;&quot;JULY,   1946SECRETMOST BfilEDIATEAMAZE 7488The following estimates of the probable Canadianshipments for August 1946 through July 31st,  1947 are a tentative guess hy Canadian Wheat Board who wish to makeit clear that with tho many uncertainties at the moment of crop yield and transport that figures must he subjectto adjustment.2.        On the has is of making available 165 million bushelswheat in terms of 145 million wheat and SO million flourthe following are estimates to the U. IC.  000 long tons atAugust - Atlantic 140 Pacific 17 total 157.      Any of this quantity taken for LFC areas will reduce correspondinglythe quantity to the U. K., September 50 Churchill.October 320 Atlantic  180 Pacific 500 total. November 320Atlantic 180 Pacific 500 total,December, January,February, March and April - 200 Atlantic 180 Pacific 380in each month respectively.      May, June and July -   80Atlantic 180 Pacific total 260 in each month respectively.3.        It will be noted the foregoing is predicted on export quantity being 165 million.      If however, whichcertaintly looks the case the present prospects of thocrop arc maintained and a larger quantity can be madeavailable it will be in the months  of Hay, June and.July 1947.4.        The quantity of flour represented by 20 million bushels of wheat equals approximately 400 thousand tonspresumably it can be reckoned that a further 200 thousand tons of flour would be available if the crop permits a quantity of wheat available  to the mills up to their maximum.5.        Mclvor will be in Washington Monday shall then have opportunity to go into their estimates.Will cable again after making a close survey withhim.

(ii)    Minute of 19th July, from theLord President of the Councilto the Prime minister have received from the Minister of Food a copyof his minute to you of today advising that,  in the lightof more hopeful information on the wheat situation, the&quot;bread rationing could now he safely suspended.I appreciate that this faces you with a difficult decision and you will,  of course/&apos;&apos; wirsh to take intoaccount the nature of the views expressed by the Cabinetyesterday.      It is a hard decision and we run some riskof contumely and scorn from our political opponents andthe press.      Though how far that is effective depends upon the nature of the statement to be made and theMinister of Food is turning his mind to this.I take into every account the political disadvantages.      But, when it comes to a choice between our being knocked about a bit,  and imposing on thecountry, particularly the housewives who should nothave this bother and anxiety needlessly thrust upon them then I think that we Ministers must take the 4knock which I do not think will be too serious andwill pass and, who knows,  it may not be as bad as wethink and, moreover,  at any rate there will be a sense of relief in many hearts.If it were subsequently ascertained,  and itmight be,  that we need not have imposed bread rationing&apos;, we Would then have a rough time which,added to the headaches of the housewives, would takelonger to get over.I have given the matter the most careful thought and both my instinct and my judgment lead me to theconclusion that the Minister of Food is right and thatjust as we took the courageous course in deciding to ration when things looked blacker,  then so we should now take the courageous course of dispensing with the rationing now that things look bettor.It ought,  if at all possible,  to be a cabinet decision.      Unfortunately,  it so happens, that both you and the Chancellor of the Exchequer are on the way to county Durham as I dictate&apos;this.      It would be most useful,  however,  if you could let me have your views and,  if possible,  those of the Chancellor.      In themeantime,  after consultation with Sir Edward Bridges,I have taken the responsibility of summoning theCabinet for tomorrow (Saturday) at 10 a. m.H. M.11, .Downing Stree t, S. W. 1.19th July,  1946.

(iii)    Draft Public statement i have received a message by telegram fromMr. G-arainer,  the Canadian Minister of Agriculture,that the new&apos;Canadian crop &quot;is now expected to reachat least 450 million bushels&quot;.This is an increase of at least 100 million bushels on any previous minimum estimate.      In addition,the Canadian Wheat Board in the past 24 hours has informed us of its advance programme of shipments tothis country,  showing an additional shipment of wheat to us during August and September.      This Is no doubtbecause the prospect of the large Canadian new crop hasencouraged the Canadian farmers to release from theirfarms still more of tho small quantity -remaining fromthe old crop.      We had been hoping for&apos;some time thatthis development would occur, but have only receivedthe assurance of it in the past 24- hours.These developments moan that our estimatedstock of wheat at the 31st August next has risen from513,000 tons to 594,000 tons.      They also mean that ourestimated stock of wheat at September 30th has risen from 590,000 to 693,000 tons.      There will be some300,000 tons of flour to add to these figures,  so that     *our total stocks of wheat and flour at the two dateswill now approximate to 9 and 10 weeks&apos; supplyrespec tively.This news from Canada has for the first timeenabled me to advise my colleagues that I am satisfiedthat it would bo safe to suspend the introduction of bread rationing on Monday next.      And II.M.  Governmenthas suspended the operation of the scheme.The new figures for the end of August and september are above the point at which, the danger ofa dislocation in distribution arises.      Should,  however,there be adverse and unexpected developments in thesupply position in the next few weeks,   it would benecessary at once to put the rationing scheme, which isnow fully prepared,  into immediate execution.      Infact,  I&apos; urge the bakers and all others concerned in the rationing&apos; system to perfect their preparations.      Thus,if rationing did after all become necessary they wouldbe able to introduce it with minimum disturbance and inconvenience.      The Ministry of Food will keep thescheme ready for immediate application.If,  however, the supply position continues toimprove, we may legitimately hope to avoid theintroduction of bread rationing.

The bounty of Providence and the wonderful help ofour Canadian friends has enabled us to suspend,  and it maybe avoid .altogether, what would necessarily have been theburdensome scheme of bread rationing.      The Government feel the whole nation will wish to express its thankfulness.By far-the best way that we can do that is to redouble our efforts to economise bread.      Our margin above the safetylevel is still a narrow one and the strict prevention ofwaste by everyone of us may decide whether or not we have tointroduce bread rationing after all.      I therefore appealmost earnestly to every man, woman, and child in the countryto be scrupulously economical in their use of bread, and above all to refrain from using it to feed poultry or animalswhile it is still fit for human consumption.In order to help us to realise how far we aresucceeding in such an economy campaign, I &quot;propose to publish the weekly figures of the total usage of flour of all kindsin this country from the present date to  the end of the difficult period of supply.      The first of these figures, whichnecessarily take some time to collect,  will be available in about two weeks&apos;  time.-5-
