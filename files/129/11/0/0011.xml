TOP secret note for Cabinet on present position in IndiaAlthough the success of the Cabinet Mission in creating an atmosphere of confidence in our intentions andin obtaining agreement of both parties to accept theStatement of May the 16th is a definite gain, it is offset by my failure to secure a coalition Government for the interim period;   and unless this can be remedied, it will-prove a complete obstacle to the satisfactory long termsettlement of the Indian problem.2.     The danger of a Congress mass-movement has recededfor the time being, and. that is a clear gain.     There isalso a temporary advantage in the fact that during Julyboth the major parties will be busy in the preparations for the Constituent Assembly,     Thus there is less feeling of insecurity than there was.     This will not. however,last long, unless I can form a National Coalition Govern-ment at an early date.     The feeling between the two main parties has been exacerbated by the recent failure,and I cannot hold out much hope that further negotiationswill secure an effective coalition Government.     Theinclusion of a Nationalist Muslim may be an insuperableobstacle.,     Jinnah and the League appear to be adamantagainst it;   and it is difficult to believe that Congress,will consent to forego It now that it has been made sopublicly a matter of prestige.     The A. I.C.C. meeting issure to harden the Congress attitude.3.     While we have made some progress in securing theconfidence of the Congress and of the country as a wholein our intentions, the negotiations have undoubtedlyalienated the Muslim League and have aroused their deepsuspicion;   and there is no doubt whatever that theLeague feels that it has not had fair treatment.     There isno hope of any truce in the communal recriminations in t\Press or that the Congress will refrain from pressing their advantage;   they will show no generosity or accommodationtowards the League,,4.     In view of this spirit, it is not likely either thatthe business of the Constituent Assembly will proceedsmoothly.     It may not even survive the first meeting.   On,all vital matters the views of the two parties will bediametrically opposed.     The Congress will not relax their,efforts to destroy the principle of group   organisation, fnor will the Muslim League conceal their intention to try and make the groups a step to Pakistan.5.     The absence of a coalition Government at the Centrewill mean a continuance in the Provinces of the difficul-ties between the Governors and their Ministries, which Ihad hoped would diminish;,     It is the fixed intention ofthe Congress High Command to make the exercise of the governors&apos; special powers impossible;   and to reduce themto the status of figureheads&apos;.     It will be a very difficult matter to decide to what extent we should resist this;

A I&quot;4abut on the protectiOQ of the Secretary of 3tateJsServices at least we must be absolutely firm.     This maylead, sooner or later, to a showdown with the Congress.6.     Serious difficulties will also almost certainlyarise with regard to the States,     There is a considerableelement in the Congress, led by Nehru, which will fomentagitation in the States by the people against the Rulers;and since it is the duty of the Crown Representative   toprotect the States from outside interference, I may onlybe able to do so at the expense of a clash with theCongress.71     Thus, for many different reasons, H.M.G. must beprepared for a crisis in India at perhaps quite an early stage.     Ho MoG0 must therefore have a breakdown policy,and cannot shelve this difficult problem because acertain success has been achieved in the summoning of theConstituent Assembly.     A crisis may arise with greatsuddenness, and we must have oar minds made up on thegeneral lines on which we will act.   I must be able to telleither party quite definitely what the consequences ofintransigence on their part will be, both to India and totheir own interests;..     I cannot do&apos;this unless H.M.G. hasa definite policy of action.8.     As I have reported more than once, the administrativemachine is badly run-down.     I attach as an Appendix a note on the position of the Services, which shows that while theadministration can be carried on for.a time provided It isnot submitted to severe strain, it would in some parts ofIndia probably be unequal even now to withstand the test of a serious movement against British rule;   and thatthe Secretary of State&apos;s Services will have to be woundup in about 18 months to two years time, unless somedrastic change of policy is decided on.     It is essential for the efficiency of the Services during this periodthat generous terms of compensation should be approved and announced.9.     Though British officers of the Indian Army are lessaffected by current political conditions than Civilianofficials, and the loyalty and discipline of the indian army are at present to all appearances satisfactory,there are doubts whether the Indian Army would respond ifasked to suppress a Congress mass movement, or to dealwith widespread communal trouble;   and in some areas thePolice also would prove  unreliable.     As time goes on,both Army and Police will become more permeated withnationalist ideas, and a less trustworthy instrument for maintaining British rule.,10.     I emphasise these points about the Services and theArmy, because it is a fallacy to suppose that the solutionlies In trying to maintain the status quo.     We have nolonger the resources, nor I think the necessary prestige and confidence in ourselves.     We cannot stand still if wc

are faced with a major crisis.     We shall either have tomove forward in. policy - and backward in authority outof part at least of India - or backward in policy to along period of British control and administration, whichwill mean reinforced Services and determination to use all necessary forces to put down disturbances.11.     If and when an Interim Government is formed, H.M;G.must treat it with the greatest tact and. forbearance.The Government will undoubtedly be provocative and tire-some in a great many of Its acts and resolutions;   butif we are to have a friendly India in the future, weshall have to put up with a great deal that we neitherapprove nor consider wise.     If we deal with the interim government in a. spirit of real friendliness, and let them make their mistakes, even if detrimental to our interests and their own, I believe that they may graduallylearn of themselves, and may even possibly realise theadvantages of remaining in the British Commonwealth or at least in very close relations with it;   whereas ifwe try to curb thee, they are likely to become even moredifficult to handle.I do not know whether it would be possible forH.M.G. to come to any understanding with the Oppositionto take India out of party politics, anyway for the first six months after the formation of an Interim Government,and to see that a general tone of friendliness and encouragement is adopted towards the new set-up.12.     To sum up, in spite of the success of the mission in securing by its skill and patience agreement of thetwo major Parties to put into operation the Statement ofthe 16th May, the failure to obtain a coalition Governmenthas once more narrowed the field of action, has increasedcommunal bitterness, and has made success in a futureattempt less likely.     The recent negotiations have bothincreased, the belief of Congress that they will shortlyobtain absolute power, and have shown that they are unlikely to use it wisely.     The distrust of the muslim league for the Congress has been still further increased.,and to it has been added, I am afraid, resentment at the refusal to form an Interim Government with the cooperationof the Muslim League, but without the Congress.     The whole situation would of course be improved in the event ofmy securing a coalition Government, and if the attitudeof the major parties in the opening session of theConstituent Assembly is reasonable;   but in both these respects the evidence of the last three months suggeststhat it would be foolish to be optimistic.     I am sorry to paint so gloomy a picture of the future, but I feelthat H.M.G. should be under no illusions as to the situa-tion with which we are likely to be faced.W.June 29th, 1946.

APPENDIXNote on the services during the war the cadre of &quot;the PCS:, has proved ;.insufficient for the tasks imposed on it, and many of the older men are tired and have lost heart.     Even among the younger men there arc lany who, finding their conditionsof service distasteful and thinking that there is no future   for them in India, wish to retire as soon as possible.Conditions are similar in the Indian Police.   The existingban on premature retirement will be lifted at the beginningof 1947 and a number of valuable British officers willprobably then leave. IBoth the I.-.C..S. and the I.P. lean heavily on the British!officers, and &quot;there has been no British recruitment sincethe war began.     To keep up the efficiency of these Services,large numbers of British recruits would be needed, but for    Iimpracticable.     Anyhow new British recruitment would not provide effective reinforcement for at least five years,and this would be too late,   Indian members of the services are tending to look more to the political aspect of their actions, and are naturally less reliable, as a Secretaryof state&apos;s service, than they were,,   There is generalbelief that the Secretary of State5s power to protecthis Services will rapidly weaken at the Centre, as italready has done in the Provinces, after an interim government assumes office.I have lately consulted the Governors by telegram aboutthe Services.     The provinces where the position is likelyto be most difficult are Bombay, the United Provinces,Bihar, and the Central Provinces.     In all these a numberof British officers are expected to retire early next year;though it might be possible to hold them for a time ifgenerous compensation terms were announced at once.Compensation would of course only be payable on the Servicesbeing wound up.The best test of the effectiveness of the Services as secretary of State&apos;s Services is whether they could run anofficial administration under section 93 of the ConstitutionAct.     The Governor of Bombay thinks that a section 93administration could not be maintained, in the face of congress opposition later than a year from now.     TheGovernor of the  U.P.  is doubtful whether a mass movementcould be held now by an official regime.     The Governor ofBihar thinks section 93 administration might.be maintainableat present but is not sure.In other Provinces, e.g. in the N.W. and N.E. thesituation about the Secretary of State&apos;s Services is better, but in most a good many valuable British officialsare expected to retire early in 1947 unless compensationterms s.re announced soon.

i1 o4 bGenerally speaking,- it is clear that the services could not be maintained in a condition fit to run a section93 administration for more than about two years at themost.     Even two years may be too long a period in someProvinces, and will be in most, unless such compensationterms are announced as will induce men to remain in service rather than to retire prematurely.     After twoyears as a maximum the Services will have to be wound upin an orderly manner and compensated, whatever theconstitutional position at the time may be.   To wind them up in an orderly manner will entail a programme for their replacement by Indians, which will take time to prepare.Notice of our intention to wind them up should thereforebe given at a very early date.There are a good many younger officers who would Ithink be glad to stay longer than two years in a newProvincial or Central service under Indian Governmentsprovided that the attitude of the ministries towards them was such as to give them a hope of fair treatment.     But ona short term view it is probable that the Interim Governmentand the Provincial Governments will be against Britishrecruitment, as indeed most of the Ministries have already said they are, and they will be indifferent to the departure of British officers already in the Services.I wish to make it clear that this is not merely a service question, but affects our whole policy.     If theSecretary of State&apos;s Services are wound up, Parliament cannot in fact be responsible for India eventhough there may bea legal responsibility.     if there were no Secretary.ofState&apos;s Services, no Governor could attempt to take overthe administration of a Province himself and run it throughofficials under section 93.      All the heads of his Servicesand the local officials in the districts would be men whoseloyalty was to the Provincial Ministry, and. they could notbe expected to support the Governor in taking action againstthe principal party in the Province.     The Governor, knowinghe could not run a section 93 administration, would have no option but to accept the advice of his ministry on alloccasions, whether his special responsibilities were affectedor not.     At all costs he would, have to retain his ministry in office, and the control of the Secretary of State over him and of him over affairs in the Province would: be purelynominal.     Thus, on or before the date when it becomes necessary to wind, up the Secretary of State&apos;s Services theresponsibility of Parliament for India will cease de factoif not de ,jure.     There can be no -long interim period underthe existing constitution.I have assumed that H.M.G. would not be prepared to change their policy and announce that they proposed to stay in the country for 15 or 20 years.     If they were to do this and to make it clear that they would use all their resources to put down disorder, the Services could perhaps be revived and reinforced and the authority of Parliamentmaintained.
