(46) 284.22nd July, 1946.CABINET.PROPOSALS FOR BREAKING UP THE POOR LAW.Joint Memorandum by the Minister of Health, Secretary of State forScotland and the Minister of National Insurance.THE official Inter-Departmental Committee which was set up to prepare proposals for legislation to break up the Poor Law have made their Report, whichhas now&apos; been submitted to the Social Services Committee. A copy of the report is attached.   A summary of the recommendations appears on pages 27-32.2. The Report seeks the approval of Ministers for officials of the Depart-ments principally concerned to open discussions with representatives of localauthorities on those proposals in the Report which affect the authorities&apos; functions.The Social Services Committee have recommended that this should be done.3. The proposals have for their purpose the final break-up of the existingPoor Law and the substitution of a comprehensive system of national assistance and welfare. Local authorities and- the general public are well aware of theGovernments intentions in this respect, but the proposals are of so important and far-reaching a character that the Cabinet should, we feel, be apprised of their main features and asked to approve their general pattern before discussions withthe local authorities begin.4. The following is an outline of the main proposals affecting localauthorities : (a) Legislation.Existing legislation dealing with public assistance, blind domiciliaryassistance, unemployment assistance and supplementary pensions should be repealed and a single Bill prepared &quot; to abolish the Poor Law and to establish a comprehensive system of national assistance and welfare.&quot;(b) Domiciliary Assistance.The assistance of all persons aged sixteen or over and their dependants,who are in need, including any persons whose national insurance pensionsor other benefits need supplementation, should be administered by theAssistance Board with their present relationship to the Minister of national insurance. The public assistance committees of local authorities should be abolished.(c) Institutional Assistance.The duty of providing accommodation and maintenance in institutionsfor those in need of it should, with certain minor exceptions, rest with the council&apos;s of counties and county boroughs (in Scotland, counties and large burghs). The responsible Ministers should be the Minister of Health andthe Secretary of State for Scotland. Persons in need would include notonly the old, but any others not capable of living a normal life in a home of their own. Persons admitted to institutions should be required to payan approved standard charge for maintenance. Those unable to do so would pay according to their means, but would be allowed to keep 5s. a week for
themselves. For those whose only resources are 265. a week retirement pension there would be a minimum charge of 21s. a week, and persons whoseresources are less than 26s. a week would be placed by the Assistance board in a position to pay 21s. a week and have 5s. a week for themselves.(d) Vagrancy.This should be the general responsibility of the Assistance Board who should have power to set up Reconditioning Centres, but local authoritiesshould have the statutory duty of providing temporary shelter for &quot; casuals &quot;as agents for the Board and at the cost of the Exchequer.(e) Handicapped Persons.While general welfare services should be provided by the assistance board and the Ministry of National Insurance as an accompaniment of thepayment of assistance and insurance benefits, local authorities should provide, for persons who suffer from some physical or mental disability(including cripples and the deaf and dumb), specialised welfare servicescomparable with those which they already provide (and should continue toprovide) for the blind. For registered blind persons over sixteen and persons suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis who have given up work to undergotreatment, the Assistance Board should have power to grant assistance atspecial rates, to be prescribed in Assistance Regulations, in substitution forthe existing domiciliary assistance schemes available to these special classes.(f) Redundant Public Assistance Staff.Such staff should, as far as possible, be found employment in the CivilService and in other departments of the local authorities. Provision will benecessary in the Bill for compensating officers who cannot be employed, andit should be proposed to local authorities that they should accept responsi-bility for such compensation.Children.5. The Inter-Departmental Committee make no recommendations at thisstage about the arrangements for dealing with the needs of children who aredeprived of parental care. Much of this problem is under examination by theCommittees for England and Wales and Scotland, of which Miss Myra Curtisand Mr. J. L. Clyde, K.C., are the respective Chairmen, and further considerationof the many questions involved and any discussions with local authorities mustnecessarily be deferred until those Committees have reported and their reports have been considered.A.

REPORT OF THE INTER-DEPARTMENTAL COMMITTEE ON the break-UP OF THE POOR LAWINTRODUCTORYI.-TERMS OF REFERENCE, &amp;c.Terms of reference . The committee was set up as a result of a meeting of Ministers heldon March 27th, 1946, under the chairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal. Themeeting recommended (Gen. 127/1st meeting) that legislation to break upthe Poor Law should be introduced in the 1946 /1947 Session, that proposals forthis legislation should be prepared by a committee of officials of the Departmentsconcerned, and that the proposals should be discussed Avith local authorities and thereafter submitted to the Social Services Committee.Departments represented2. The committee consisted of representatives of the folloAving Depart-ments : Assistance Board Home office ministry of Education Ministry of Labour and NationalMinistry of Health -           service department of Health for Scot-          Ministry of National Insuranceland Treasury3. A summary of the Committee&apos;s recommendations and of other points onwhich Ministerial directions are required is given on pages 27-32. The field Ayehave had to cover is a large one, and to avoid burdening the report with detailno mention is made at this stage of a variety of points which will have to appear in the proposed legislation but which it does not seem necessary to bring to thenotice of Ministers.Consultation with Local Authorities4. The approval of Ministers is sought for officials of the Departmentsprincipally concerned to open discussions Avith representatives of localauthorities on those of the committee&apos;s proposals which affect the functions ofthe. authorities. The discussions may throw up points requiring decision whichare not dealt with in our report, and a further report will no doubt be necessarygiving the outcome of the discussions and dealing Avith any further mattersAvhich have arisen.Meaning of the term Local Authority: Application of the report to Scotland5. Throughout the report, except Avhere Ave indicate otherwise, we use the term local authority to mean, in England and Wales, the Councils of counties and County Boroughs, and in Scotland, the Councils of Counties and large burghs. The committee&apos;s proposals are stated in terms appropriate to Englandand Wales, but are intended to apply throughout Great Britain, with suchadaptations only as the different pattern of Scottish law and local governmentmay require.II.-THE APPROACH TO THE problem the present arrangements6. The services affording assistance on a needs test to adult persons in their homes (and through those adults to their dependants) are :-(1) Unemployment Assistance, paid by the Assistance Board, under theUnemployment Assistance Acts, 1934 to 1940 (a) to persons receiving unemployment benefit who find it insufficient for their needs because, for example, of  a high rent, adependant for Avhom they do not receive benefit, or other special needs;
(b) to insurable unemployed persons not qualified for benefit. Unem-ployment assistance to persons in this class will be much diminished by the proposal in the National Insurance Bill tocontinue payments at benefit rates after the exhaustion of insurance rights.(2) Supplementary Pensions, paid by the Assistance Board, under the old age and Widows&apos; Pensions Act, 1940, and the Pensions and Deter-mination of Needs Act, 1943, to old age pensioners and to widow-pensioners who are either 60 or over or are entitled to receivewidows&apos; pensions including additional allowances in respectof children (i.e., the younger widows with young children). It isestimated that the number of supplementary pensioners (now about1^ millions) will be reduced by about two-thirds from October, 1946,as a result of the increases in the rates of main pension. The restwill continue to need supplementary pensions in spite of the increasesbecause of high rents or other special needs.(3) Blind Domiciliary A assistance, paid by local authorities, under the blind persons Acts, to registered blind persons who are in need.(4) Tuberculosis Treatment Allowances, paid by local authorities, under awar-time scheme started in 1943 and financed by the Central Govern-ment, to persons suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis who have good prospects of recovery under treatment and give up employment inorder to undergo treatment.(5) Outdoor Relief under the Poor Law, paid by local authorities to anyperson in need who cannot be assisted under any of the foregoingschemes.   The Poor Law is thus the residual assistance service.In all these schemes the responsible authority, sometimes in collaboration withvoluntary associations, is concerned with the general welfare of the applicantand his family as a natural outcome of its function of meeting need.In addition to these five services there is also the scheme of non-contributoryold age pensions (the administration of which is in process of being transferredto the Assistance Board), about which we make recommendations later (part VII).Whereas the other schemes all turn on an estimate of need, which they set out tomeet in full, the scheme of non-contributory old age pensions is a scheme offlat rate pensions for persons of limited means.7. If adults are in need of institutional assistance it is provided by localauthorities under the Poor Law, except that hospital treatment may be and oftenis provided as a health service. We assume that when our proposals come intooperation the provision of hospital treatment (including treatment in mentalinstitutions) will at the same time be passing from local authorities ,to the newHospital Authorities of the National Health Service.8. In general, children do not present a separate problem, their needs being dealt with where necessary as part of the needs of&quot; the adhlts, usually their parents, on whom they are dependent. A minority of children are, however,deprived of parental care by the death, desertion, or neglect of their parents,without having been fortunate enough to find a relative or other person who is willing to take responsibility for looking after them. Provision is made forthese children both under the Poor Law and under other legislation. Theparticular problem of &quot; deprived children &quot; is referred to in part VIII of our report and in Appendix I.The object9 The object which it is desired to achieve, and which makes it necessary to review as a whole the complex of arrangements described above, is the finalbreak-up of the Poor Law.10. The &apos;&apos; unpopularity &apos;&apos; of the Poor Law has in part reflected the healthyreluctance of most people, which no one would wish to see weakened, to look to thecommunity to keep them instead of relying upon themselves. Some of the features of Poor Law administration which have contributed to that unpopularity havebeen necessary deterrents to the small minority of the shiftless and ne&apos;er-do-well
which exists in any community. On the other hand many people in genuine need of assistance have been deterred from seeking it by dislike and fear of the PoorLaw. and many who have been obliged to seek assistance have done so under a sense of degradation which they should have had no occasion to feel. Thisunpopularity of the Poor Law has survived the humane and enlightenedadministration which local authorities have developed, and also the attemptswhich they have made to break away from the associations of the past by inventingnew titles (e.g., the current term &quot; Social Welfare &quot;). It persists because it isdeeply grounded in prejudices which derive from days of a different outlook onpoverty and of a harsher administration.11. The Public Health Acts of the last century and the Old Age pensions act of 1908 began the process of breaking up the Poor Law. It will be taken agreat deal further by the National Health Service Bill, which will make it unnecessary for anyone to seek medical relief under the Poor Law, and by the family Allowances Act and the National Insurance and Industrial Injuries Bills,which will make it unnecessary for the majority of people to seek any other formof financial assistance.The guiding principle12. Our report assumes that the Poor Law legislation will now be whollyrepealed, that the problem of need will be dealt with afresh in new legislation which will become operative on the same day as the full National Insurance schemeand National Health Service and that the guiding principle of the new legislation will be that -(1) the Assistance Board will be responsible for assisting any persons living in their homes whose needs are not fully met by the National insurance and allied services, and for providing such persons and their dependants with the kind of general welfare service which the Boardalready provide for old people and other applicants; and &quot;(2) local authorities will be responsible, except in a few special cases, for providing institutional care for those who need it and specialisedwelfare services for certain defined classes of persons.The spirit of the new administration13. A mere change in the administrative arrangements may not, however,be sufficient to prevent the new services acquiring a taint and being thought of as the old Poor Law under a new name. To avoid this the services should be administered from the start in a new spirit. Although assistance will have tobe based on a test of need (if it were not the whole basis of the insurance services would be threatened), the needs test now operated by the Assistance Board isgenerally accepted as a humane and moderate test. We are sure that theAssistance Board will administer assistance under a broader scheme with as muchcare for the welfare of applicants as they have shown in their administration ofsupplementary pensions since 1940, to which tribute has been paid by Members-on both sides of the House of Commons. There will, of course, be some cases inwhich firmness will be necessary; the Board will need powers, among others, toset up &apos;&apos; Reconditioning Centres &apos;&apos; for the &quot; work-shy 5&apos; and to require such persons to enter a Centre as a condition of receiving an allowance. Similarlyfirm administration will be necessary to deal with the old problem of vagrancy,but the ultimate object here will always be to persuade the younger able-bodiedtramp to settle down in steady employment or to undertake a course of training to that end, and to persuade the older casual who is no longer fit for work togive up &quot; the road &quot; and settle down in a suitable Home. Local authorities willbe encouraged to carry out the duties laid upon them in a similar spirit. We are:sure they will respond fully to the opportunity to break away from the associations and restrictions of the Poor Law; indeed, no body of opinion has been moreforward in desiring an end to the Poor Law than the authorities themselves. the poor Law will, however, leave a legacy of old institution premises which must continue to be used for some time. In the future there will be a need for smallerand more specialised buildings, e.g., Homes and Hostels for the old, but the factmust be faced that it will take a long time to expand and convert the presentaccommodation, often old and unsatisfactory, into what is required.
THE COMMITTEES PROPOSALSIII. PAYMENTS TO PERSONS LIVING IN THEIR OWN HOMES.14. In this part of the report we set out our proposals for assistance for people in their own homes. The special problems affecting the grant of assistanceto the blind and tuberculous are, however, dealt with in part V, which relates to persons who are physically and mentally handicapped.The White Paper proposals15. The White Paper on Social Insurance, after describing the provisions which, with certain modifications, are now included in the Family AllowancesAct, the National Insurance Bill, and the National Insurance (industrial injuries) Bill, proceeded to say (paragraph 13) that &quot;in reserve there must remain a scheme of National Assistance designed to fill the inevitable gaps leftby insurance and to supplement it where an examination of individual needsshows that supplement is necessary.&quot; Paragraph 159 of the White Paper statedthat &quot; The Government propose that the scope of National Assistance (now con-fined broadly to persons in receipt of old-age pensions, widow pensioners with children and able-bodied&apos; persons normally employed in insurable occupations)should be extended to include financial assistance to all on proof of need; and thatthe administration of National Assistance should be centralised in one Depart-ment.&quot;Principles of the Committee&apos;s proposals16. The Memorandum by the Ministers of Health and National Insurance,which was considered by the Meeting of Ministers on the 27th March, 1946, isfounded on the same principles, and we ourselves have proceeded on the under-standing that the Assistance Board will be responsible for financial assistanceto all persons with insufficient means to meet their needs. With certain excep-tions to be mentioned in paragraphs 40-47, any person aged not less than sixteenshould, if in need of such assistance, be entitled to apply to the Board for an allowance, and the allowance granted should be adequate to meet the needs ofthe person and his dependants by reference to some national standard. Theacceptance of this principle will make it possible to terminate all the partialschemes described in paragraph 6, except that, in accordance with the provisionsof the National Insurance Bill, the scheme of not-contributory old-age pensionswill continue in being for some time to come (see part VII).The Assistance Board&apos;s functions17. We cannot foresee to what extent the allowances granted by the board will be granted to persons who are ineligible for insurance benefits and to what extent they will be granted to persons who are receiving insurance benefits,including Retirement Pensions, but for some special reason (e.g., a highrent) find them inadequate for their needs. We think, however, that cases in the latter category will be sufficiently numerous to make it desirablethat the description of the Board&apos;s functions in the Bill should include an explicit reference to the function of supplementing insurance benefits,including pensions, where necessary. It should be made plain in the Bill thatas regards all the people whom they are assisting (including those assisted byway of supplementation of insurance benefits) the Board are to conduct their administration in such a way as may best promote their welfare and the welfare of their dependants. There is a model for this in section 10 (4) of the Old age and Widows&apos; Pensions Act, 1940, which is the basis on which the Board havebeen carrying out the various welfare services described in their last annual report.18. Apart from a distinction for blind and tuberculous persons which we* propose later (paragraph 81), we do not think it will be necessary to provide in the Bill for a division of national assistance into different categories with different titles for the various classes of persons whom the scheme will cover. Itwill, however, be necessary to make some distinctions in administration. Forinstance, there is much to be said for preserving the term &quot; supplementarypension &quot; which is now well established; and different procedures of application and payment will be necessary for the pensioners who should be able to get their application forms and be paid at the Post Offices where they draw their mainpensions, and for the unemployed who should apply, register for work and bepaid their assistance at Employment Exchanges.
1iRegulation of the standard of assistance19. The national standard which will regulate the amount of the allowances to be granted should be embodied in Regulations which will besubmitted to Parliament by the Minister of National Insurance and which willnot become operative until they have been approved by affirmative resolution of both Houses. As at present, the drafts of any such Regulations should beprepared by the Assistance Board, and any variations between the Regulationssubmitted to Parliament by the Minister and the draft submitted to the minister by the Board should be the subject of a report to Parliament. Any regulations which the Board frame will, no doubt, conform with past precedents in their general structure, viz. : they will lay down certain arithmetical rules for thecomputation of the needs of different persons and groups of persons, includingarithmetical rules for the treatment of certain types of resource, but will allow the Board a discretion in dealing with cases which fall outside the scope of therules or where it is felt that the results of a purely arithmetical approach wouldnot be appropriate; for example, sick nersons may need special dietaries whichmust be allowed for by some increase in the allowance to be paid, but the properamount of the increase cannot be dealt with by rule and must be left to the judg-ment of the officer in the light of the facts.Appeal Tribunals20. Any person who applies for an allowance and is dissatisfied with theamount of the.allowance granted should be entitled to appeal to the local appeal tribunal, which already deals with appeals by persons who are dissatisfied withthe amounts granted them by way of unemployment assistance or supplementarypension. The Chairmen of these Tribunals are appointed by the Minister ofNational Insurance, and of the other two members one is drawn from a panel of persons appointed by the Minister to represent workpeople and the otherrepresents the Board.Registration for employment21. In the case of an able-bodied person of working age we consider thatan allowance should not ordinarily be granted save on condition thatthe recipient registers at the Local Office of the Ministry of Labour and NationalService in the same way as a claimant for unemployment benefit. This is already the practice in relation to unemployment assistance. It will be necessary toallow exceptions from this rule; for example, the widow with young children to look after.Exceptional and urgent needs22. The grant by the Assistance Board of regular weekly allowances tothose who can show a need for them would not suffice to meet all the needs whichmay arise. For example, the Board will have to retain their present powers to supplement allowances where necessary by lump sum grants to meet what inthe present terminology are called exceptional needs, such as serious deficienciesof clothing, bedding or household utensils. Further, the Board must bear theresponsibility for dealing with need suddenly arising&quot; in households which theyare not already supporting by weekly allowances, just as the Poor Law provides(section 17 of the English Poor Law Act, 1930) that &quot; every relieving officer, incases of sudden or urgent necessity, shall give such relief otherwise than in money as may be appropriate.&quot; In such circumstances the relieving officer wouldgrant a food ticket, an order for admittance to the institution, or an order for medical aid. Under the future arrangements medical aid will be given throughthe National Health Service. We discuss the arrangements for entry to institu-tions in paragraph 59. Where the need is not one for medical aid or institutionalcare, we think that it should ordinarily be met by the Assistance Board grantingcash, though they may occasionally need to follow the Poor Law practice of agrant in kind. Much is sometimes made of the &quot;personal responsibility&quot; of therelieving officer, as distinct frOm the employing authority, to see that need ismet in these cases, but it seems to us that in the conditions of to-day the doctrine of personal statutory responsibility on individual officers is outmoded, and wedo not think that any attempt should be made to introduce a distinction betweenthe. responsibility of the Board and the responsibility of their officers.23. The Board will not require for these purposes any powers of a different character from their present powers, but there is one aspect of sudden or urgent
sneed for which special provision would be necessary. &quot; Mass distress &quot; caused,for example, by serious floods could not be suitably met by cash assistance to-homeless persons who might not be able to buy food or clothing in the shops orto cook food even if they could buy it. For such cases some form of communalprovision may be required (e.g., &quot; soup kitchens &quot;), and the Board must thereforebe given power to deal with &quot; mass distress &quot; without the individual writtenapplications and records which are necessary for the assistance they administernow.Resources24. We propose that only the resources of the applicant and his dependantsshould in general be regarded as available to maintain the applicant, and thatthe resources of non-dependent members of the applicants household, such asearning sons and daughters living with him, should be dealt with in accordancewith the rules which were substituted for the former household means test bythe First Schedule to the Determination of Needs Act, 1941, which should bere-enacted for this purpose. The effect of these rules is that where the applicantis the householder each non-dependent member is assumed to make an appropriatecontribution fixed by Regulations (at present never more than 7s. a week) towardsthe rent and the general overhead expenses of the household; and where theapplicant is living as a member of the household of a son, daughter, father ormother, who is in possession of an income not less than a certain minimum figurefixed by Regulations (at present  6 a week plus 15s. for each dependant of the householder after the first), it is assumed that the applicant will get his keepprovided free and needs only a small sum for minor personal expenses.Personal resources: disregards25. For the resources of the applicant himself and his dependants thepresent position is that the treatment of some resources is laid down by statute(section 38 (3) of the Unemployment Act, 1934, and subsequent legislation); thetreatment of earnings is laid down in Regulations, and the treatment of other resources is left by the Regulations to the discretion of the Board. In fact, overa very wide field the Board have been in the habit of allowing the applicant thebenefit of the first 7s. &amp;d. a week of a resource.26. We do not propose that there should be any variation from this generalplan, but the details of the resources which the Board are required to disregardby statutory direction will need to be reconsidered. Subject to what is said inparagraph 37 about accumulations of resources we think that the Bill should contain directions to the Assistance Board to disregard income of the followingkinds to the extent stated : (1) Sick pay from a Friendly Society or Trade Union the first 7s. Qd. a week.(2) Superannuation payments the first 10s. Qd. a week.(3) Maternity  Grant  and Maternity  Attendance  Allowance  under  theNational Insurance Act the whole.(4) Death Grant under the National Insurance A ct the whole.(5) (a) Wounds and disability pensions paid to ex-service personnel.(b) Disablement pensions paid under the Personal Injuries (Civilians)Scheme to civilians injured in air raids, and to certain other persons.(c) Disablement  benefit under the National Insurance  (industrial injuries) Act, 1946.(d) Weekly payments under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Acts, so faras they continue after the new scheme of industrial injury benefitcomes into payment.We recommend that these resources should each be dealt with onthe basis that the Board should disregard half of the resource, with aminimum disregard of 7s. 6d. a week and a maximum disregard of20s. a week; and that the disregard should apply to the sum actually&apos; r^eived, including allowances for dependants or other forms of supple-mentary allowances. At present, allowances attached to disability pensions are not disregarded.We set out in a table in Appendix II the present statutory disregards andthose we propose; and we discuss the proposals, and the points at which theydepart from the present statutory requirements, in the following paragraphs.
27. Sickness Benefit.-An important feature of our proposals is the omissionfrom the list of disregards of any disregard for sickness benefit under the national insurance Bill. The importance of the omission derives from the fact that thereis at present a disregard (which applies both to Public Assistance Authoritiesand the Assistance Board) of 10s. Qd. a week for sickness and disablement benefit under the National Health Insurance Acts. Sick persons of working age are atpresent the responsibility of the Public Assistance Authorities, not of theAssistance Board, but the scales of most Authorities are comparable with thoseof the Board. Except where the Board&apos;s scales are more favourable than theAuthority&apos;s scales the effect of not extending the existing disregard to sickness benefit under the National Insurance Act Avould be to place persons who hadto seek assistance in supplementation of the new insurance benefit at a disadvantage to the extent of 10s. Qd. a week. Persons actually in receipt ofpublic assistance at or shortly before the appointed day would be ensured against any drop in their incomes as a result of the changes to be made by a general provision in the Bill on the lines of section 13 of the Old Age and Widows&apos;Pensions Act, 1940; but such a provision would, of course, not cover new cases.28. A requirement that sickness benefit should be disregarded (though notto the extent to which it is now disregarded) first appeared in relation to poorlaw relief in the original National Health Insurance legislation of 1911. the ideas underlying other disregards are not hard to find, but it is not possible nowto throw much light on the reasons for the disregard of sickness benefit apart,perhaps, from a not altogether logical association with Friendly Society sick pay for which a disregard was already required. It may, however, be assumed thatthe reasons were that the benefit itself was not on a subsistence basis and, inparticular, did not include allowances for dependants, and that it was felt atthe time that poor relief provided at best the barest of livelihoods and might not make adequate provision for any additional needs arising from the sickness. Thenew benefit will, however, be on a subsistence basis and will include allowances for dependants; and the Assistance Board will be able, as now, to makediscretionary additions in assistance allowances, according to the particularrequirements of the case, to meet any special needs due to sickness. To disregardsickness benefit would mean that very large numbers of insurance claimants would automatically be eligible for substantial sums by way of assistance, and, as theAssistance Board said in a note when the matter was considered in 1944, thenumbers might &quot; be so large as to be inconsistent with the intention that the new scheme shall provide against wTant mainly by means of Insurance, leavingAssistance to play its part only in exceptional cases.&quot; A note prepared by officials at the same time said : &quot; If national assistance is intended to be supplementary to benefits, to calculate it without reference to those benefits is contrary to reasonand common sense.&quot;29. The same arguments apply Avith equal force to most of the other national insurance benefits and pensions and to the family allowances which go with them :there should, for example, be no disregard of family allowances or of thetemporary Injury Benefit under the Industrial Injuries scheme. They do notapply to the National Insurance payments for which we propose disregards(Maternity Grant and Attendance Allowance, Death Grant and DisablementBenefit under the Industrial Injuries scheme) for reasons which we give in discussing these payments below.30. Friendly Society and Trade Union Sick pay. Our proposal to disregard the first 7s. 6d. a week of Friendly Society sick pay compares with a presentrequirement to disregard the first 5s. We propose this increase in order toencourage voluntary insurance and because the Board do, in fact, disregard thefirst 7s. Qd. of many other resources. Sick pay from a Trade Union, for whichwe have proposed similar treatment, is not mentioned in current legislationgoverning the Assistance Board, but under the Poor Law Act, 1934, it has tobe treated in the same way as Friendly Society sick pay for public assistancepurposes.31. Superannuation Payments. The disregard of the first 10s. Qd. appliesat present only to supplementary pensions, not to unemployment assistance; we propose that it should apply to all forms of national assistance.32.   Maternity  Grant  and Attendance Allowance under  the  national insurance Act. Maternity grant will be a lump sum of  4, attendance allowancea weekly payment of  1 for four weeks for women who are not gainfully occupied.[32088] c
Our proposal that the whole of such payments should be disregarded is in line with a requirement at present to disregard the whole of a maternity benefit (a lump sum of  2) paid under the National Health Insurance Acts. Maternitygrant is exactly comparable with the present maternity benefit (except in amount),and all three benefits are alike in being payments made in respect of the expensesof a confinement.33. Death Grant under the National Insurance Act. Such grants are intended for the expenses of funerals and clearly should not be consideredavailable for other purposes.34. Disability Pensions, &amp;c. We have proposed a similar rule for fourdifferent kinds of income : Avounds and disability pensions, disablement pension under the Personal Injuries scheme, disablement benefit under the industrial injuries scheme and continuing weekly payments under the Workmen&apos;s Com-pensation Acts. All four are alike, and differ from injury benefit under theIndustrial Injuries scheme, in being based on an ascertainment of the person&apos;sdegree of disablement and in being payable on that basis, even though he may notbe wholly incapacitated for work and may, indeed, be able to carry on his ordinaryemployment; i.e., they include an element of solatium for injury or loss of amenity.The rule we propose would be less generous than the present rule to disabilitypensioners with a pension of less than 40s. a week, who would be allowedone-half whereas the present rule, is to disregard the first 20s. a week. Thisdisadvantage would, however, sometimes be partly offset by the application ofthe disregard to additional allowances. The rule would also be less generous to persons receiving weekly payments under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation Actsexceeding 40s. a week, who would be allowed a maximum of 20s. as comparedwith the present rule to disregard one-half. In the case of the disabilitypensioner the change would be a change in the rule which has been in operationsince 1934; in the case of the person on workmen&apos;s compensation it wouldsimilarly be a change in a rule of long standing but, in practice, a change only by comparison with what has happened quite recently. When the disregard ofone-half was laid down for workmen&apos;s compensation it could not in any casshave resulted in the disregard of more than 20s., and does so now only becauseof recent increases in the scale of payments and awards of allowances fordependants. In so far as the change might mean, in either kind of case, an actual reduction in the income of a person in receipt of assistance at or shortly before the Appointed Day, his income position could be safeguarded in the waysuggested in paragraph 27.35. Earnings. The existing disregards to which we have referred so far arerequired by statute and are reproduced in Regulations. In addition the Regula-tions, following a general provision in the Act that &quot; due regard shall be hadto the personal requirements of all persons whose resources are taken intoaccount,&quot; require that out of any earnings by the applicant and his dependantscertain &quot; allowances for personal requirements &quot; (in effect disregards) are to bemade. As the treatment of earnings will no doubt again be left to be prescribed in Regulations, after consideration by the Board, it is not thought necessary toreport in detail on the subject.36. Cumulative Disregards. With the exception of superannuation, forwhich the disregard is the first 10s. Qd. of the aggregate of superannuation pay-ments received by the applicant and his wife, the existing disregards applying to weekly resources are cumulative. If this position were maintained it wouldmean in an extreme case the disregard of a large sum. Thus a man with a wife and child whose scale rates of assistance with rent allowance come to 50s. mayhave an 80 per cent, disability pension of 36s. a week, an allowance of 14s. a weekattached to the pension for the wife and child, 10s. Qd. a week superannuation and 7s. Qd. a week Friendly Society sick pay. 20s. of the pension and allowances and the whole of the other payments would be disregarded, 30s. only would betaken into account in all and he would receive 20s. a week assistance and a total income of 88s., compared with the 50s. a week which would be the total income of a person similarly circumstanced except that he had no resources but his assistance.37. The practice of disregarding part of a person&apos;s income is inconsistent with the conception of assistance according to need, and in cases such as thatdescribed, though they are exceptional, would produce a result which bore norelation whatever to the person&apos;s needs as measured by the standard laid downin Regulations. We think there should be a limit to the extent to which disregards
may accumulate in any one case, and accordingly propose that, in respect of allthe forms of weekly income mentioned above except earnings and maternityattendance allowance, the total sum to be disregarded should be 10s. Qd. or theamount that would be disregarded on any one of the applicants resources if thatis more than 10s. Qd. We exclude earnings because every encouragement shouldbe given to applicants to take work, and maternity attendance allowance because it is a temporary allowance for the extra needs of confinement, The rule wouldmean, in the example we have given, the disregard of 20s. instead of 38s.38. Capital. We propose that war savings should be protected to the extentalready provided for in the Determination of Needs Act, 1941 (viz., the first 375 of individual holdings). In so far as capital is hot protected as war savingswe think it should continue to be dealt with in accordance with the present rule in section 38 (3) of the. Unemployment Act, 1934, as amended by section 1 of thePensions and Determination of Needs Act, 1943, viz., that the first  25 shouldbe disregarded, and that in so far as the capital of the applicant and his wife and other dependants exceeds  25 but does not exceed  400 the capital is takeninto account to the extent of Qd. a week for every complete  25 after the first.Capital of more than  400 will ordinarily disqualify for an allowance. If an applicant for an allowance owns the house in which he lives, its value should, asat present, be disregarded. These provisions, which include substantial con-cessions made as recently as 1943, have not given rise to serious criticism.39. The special protection for capital in the form of war savings applies to investments made in war savings up to a &quot; determined date &quot; to be fixed byOrder in Council. This date may be fixed before the payment of income taxcredits, and credits and gratuities to members of the Forces and Civil defence personnel, has been completed, and the effect would be that such payments made before the &quot; determined date &quot; might be protected as &quot;war savings &quot; but anymade afterwards would not. We propose, therefore, that provision should bemade in the Bill for protection as &apos;&apos; war savings &quot; to be afforded to any of thesecredits and gratuities which are paid after the &quot; determined date &quot; and are putinto one of the prescribed forms of Government investments. The lateSir Kingsley Wood, when Chancellor of the Exchequer, gave a pledge that thiswould be done for income tax credits.Some Special Problems40. Persons in Full-Time Work. We propose that the Bill should contain a clause prohibiting the grant of assistance to a person in full-time employment,save in circumstances of sudden or urgent necessity (that is to say continuingweekly allowances should not be paid to persons in full-time work). TheUnemployment Assistance Act, 1934, precludes the grant of any allowance atpresent to such a person.41. Sudden or urgent necessity will commonly arise where a person has just started work but will receive no wages for a period, extending perhaps toa fortnight or even more, because the employers pay arrangements provide forthe payment at the end of one week of the wages earned in the preceding week(or even earlier). It seems to us to be wrong that there should be a charge on public funds to meet a need which the employer could prevent by making an advance of wages actually earned. The Assistance Board could be empoweredto require an employer to reimburse to them the cost of assistance given in such circumstances, but as the employer would withhold from wages the amountrepaid a provision of this kind would mean in effect that the assistance wasgiven on loan. As we do not propose the retention for national assistancegenerally of the public assistance power to grant relief on loan (see part VI),we ask Ministers to say whether there should be a special power to recover from employers in the circumstances described in this paragraph.42. Persons engaged in trade disputes. A person who is out of workbecause of a trade dispute is disqualified for insurance benefit, and under theprovisions of clause 13 (1) of the National Insurance Bill will still be disqualified in the future. A person is similarly disqualified for unemployment assistance under the proviso to section 36 (1) of the Unemployment AssistanceAct, 1934, and can therefore look only to the Poor Law if in need. As theAssistance Board will inherit from the Public Assistance Authorities the dutyof dealing with need arising in consequence of a trade dispute, the Bill shouldlay downDthe principles on which applications for assistance in these circum-stances should be dealt with.
-r i j There 1S no specific reference to trade disputes in the Poor Law for england and Wales, but since the case of Attorney General v. Merthyr Tydfilin 1900 it has been an accepted principle that relief may not be given to anable-bodied person unemployed because of a trade dispute. It may be givento his dependants if they are in need; and the duty to afford relief in &quot; suddenor urgent necessity .... otherwise than in money &quot; overrides other considera-tions in the last resort even in relation to the striker himself. For scotland the Poor Law Emergency Provisions (Scotland) Act, 1927, has made statutory provision on the lines of established practice in England and Wales. The PoorLaw in England and Wales, but not in Scotland, provides moreover that anyrelief legally given to a person over 21 years of age may be granted on loan; and recovery can be effected by instalments from the employer who is empowered todeduct the amounts repaid from future wages.44. Presumably the object of withholding relief from a person engagedin a trade dispute but allowing it to be paid as necessary only to his or herdependants is to avoid the financing of trade disputes out of public funds, butthis object is not really attained where the applicant has dependants. the husband cannot be prevented from sharing the relief granted to his wife andchildren and all the probabilities are that he will do so. Moreover, the familymay have substantial means of which, if they are treated in the normal way,little or no account will be taken in assessing the allowance; the applicant andhis family may therefore be able to carry on for an indefinite period on theall owance granted to the dependants together with such other means as theymay possess. These considerations do not, of course, apply to a person withoutdependants who is relieved only if in sudden or urgent need.45. A Cabinet Committee considered the matter in 1943 and came to theconclusion that legislation should follow generally the lines of present practice.We have been unable to discover any better solution and we accordingly recom-mend that the Bill should provide as follows : (1) The grant of assistance to an able-bodied person unemployed as the resultof a trade dispute would be prohibited save in circumstances of suddenor urgent necessity.(2) The Assistance Board would be empowered to grant assistance without this restriction to the dependants of such a person if they are in need according to the Regulations.(3) The decision whether the unemployment of an applicant for assistance is due to a trade dispute would depend on the decision of theInsurance Officer of the Ministry of National Insurance in regardto claims to unemployment benefit; that is to say the foregoing provisions would apply to a person &apos;&apos; disqualified from receivingbenefit .... owing to his having lost employment by reason of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute.&quot; (The words quoted appearat present in the Unemployment Assistance Act which goes on torefer also to the &apos;&apos; uninsured person who would have been sodisqualified if he had been so insured &quot; : it may be necessary to retain the reference to the uninsured person to cover this exceptional case.)46. It remains for Ministers to consider whether the power which PublicAssistance Authorities in England and Wales possess to grant relief on loanshould be retained in respect of assistance given in these circumstances^ as stated elsewhere (part VI) we do not recommend the extension to national assistance generally of the power to grant relief on loan, but such a power could,if Ministers desired, be taken in respect of assistance given in specific classesof cases such as the class discussed here. The power might prove of value as a deterrent since many applicants possessing other means might not come forassistance for their families if they knew that the money would have to be repaid.At the same time, we must point out that, although the original Scottishprovisions relating to trade disputes included the power to grant relief on loan,the power has since been withdrawn.47 Ministers may feel that the application to national assistance of sucha power, even in respect of assistance to &quot;strikers,&quot; would meet with strong political&apos; opposition, particularly in Scotland where it would mean the re-mtro-duction of a power of a deterrent character which has no place in current lawand practice: We feel, therefore, that we should do no more than draw theattention of Ministers to the position, without making any recommendation.
48. Other problem cases. Under Section 40 of the unemployment assistance Act, 1934, the Assistance Board are empowered to deal with appropriate cases as follows : (1) To pay the&apos; whole or part of the allowance to a member of the householdother than the applicant.(Note. The corresponding power in regard to supplementary pensions is wider as payment can be made to a person outsidethe household.)(2) To give assistance in kind.(3) To set up &apos;&apos; work-centres &apos;&apos; and to make the payment of an allowanceconditional on the applicants entering such a centre.(4) To make the payment of an allowance conditional on the applicantsentering a &quot; workhouse,&quot; where arrangements for the jDurpose canbe made with the local authority.49. The power to set up &quot;work-centres &quot; has not been used at all since1939, and since then there has also been little occasion to make use of the other powers. In the relatively few cases in which the powers were exercised beforethe war, the power to pay allowances to other persons was used almost entirely to protect dependants from neglect (e.g., where the applicant gambled or drankheavily); the power to issue allowances in kind was used partly for the same reason and partly as a penalty and deterrent for the man who had settled down onallowances (possibly with suspected undisclosed part-time employment, e.g.,as a book-maker&apos;s runner) and persistently failed to avail himself of opportunities -ties of suitable employment or of training- to fit him for regular employment;and the &quot; work-centre &quot; and &quot; workhouse &apos; powers were used only for the last-mentioned kind of case.50. We think the Board should have similar powers under the new Bill(including the wider power referred to in (1) ), though some of them would haveto be expressed in different terms. The exercise .of the powers by the Board&apos;sofficers should be subject, as now, to a right of appeal to the Appeal Tribunal.We discuss the &quot;work-centre&quot; and &quot;workhouse&quot; conditions further in the institutional assistance section of the report (part IV).IV.-MAINTENANCE IN INSTITUTIONS.51. In this part of the report we deal with the arrangements to be madefor maintaining in institutions the various classes of persons who cannot be, or should not be, assisted in their own homes.   They can be divided broadly into &apos;(1) old persons;(2) other persons who are not capable of living a normal life in homes oftheir own (e.g., cripples and sub-normal persons who do not need fullhospital care but who have no family or whose family are unable or unwilling to care for them) or who have no home;(3) able-bodied persons, either homeless wanderers (the &quot;casuals&quot;) or&apos;&apos; work-shy &apos;&apos; persons on whom every other possible persuasion has beentried without success.It is convenient to use the term &apos;&apos; institution &apos;&apos; in the report though it maybe desirable to seek different and perhaps more varied language in order to malea break with the associations of the Poor Law Institution.The White Paper proposals52. The White Paper proposed (paragraph 160) that the provision of&quot;accommodation for such old persons as need it&quot; should be the responsibilityof local authorities, and that the Assistance Board should have the duty of&apos;&apos; making suitable provision for those, other than the sick, the young and theold, for whom assistance in cash is not appropriate.&quot;53. We have seen no reason to question that the Assistance Board shouldbe responsible for the able-bodied, though the proposals we make provide forclose co-operation between the Board and local authorities. We think, however,for the reasons set out in paragraph 56, that the responsibility of local authorities
to provide accommodation for those who need it should extend beyond the oldto include any other persons not capable of living a normal life in a home of theirown. It should also include persons rendered homeless through eviction, fire,flood, &amp;c.Accommodation to be provided by Local Authorities54. Local authorities should be encouraged to provide as soon as possible,in place of the general institution, specialised accommodation suited to the varyingneeds of the persons under their care, particularly small Homes for the old andinfirm. There is, however, a mixed class of persons for whom such accommoda-tion would not be suitable. It includes old people who, because perhaps ofeccentricity or bad habits, would be a disturbing element in a small Homeaccommodating well-behaved old people. It also includes a variety of types ofdisabled and sub-normal people of varying ages between whom and &quot; sick &quot;persons needing hospital care and treatment the line is often uncertain.Numerically this class is small but persons in it should continue to be maintained in their own localities as it would be unfair to take them far away from relations and friends.55. It seems clear, therefore, that, though everyone wishes to see an end tothe large mixed workhouse, something in the nature of a small general hostelto which persons unsuitable for the new type of specialised accommodation canbe admitted will still be necessary in every local authority area. Such an establish-ment could be used also as the authority&apos;s clearing or reception centre and forthe accommodation, when occasion arose, of temporarily homeless persons suchas those referred to in paragraph 53.56. We think that the local authorities should provide the establishmentsrequired for these miscellaneous classes. Our reasons for recommending thisdeparture from the proposals in the White Paper are three-fold : (1) if threeauthorities instead of two were responsible for providing institutional accom-modation (the Health Service for the sick, the local authority for the old andthe young and the Assistance Board for the small residue), the problem of classi-fication and of deciding where each applicant can best be accommodated wouldbe intensified; (2) the provision by the Assistance Board of a large number ofsmall institutions all over the country, side by side with the general hostels whichthe authorities would require as their clearing centres and for old people not suitable for a specialised home, would mean duplication of effort and unnecessaryexpense in staff and premises; and (3) in the wholesale reshaping of social services now in contemplation, a large-scale transfer of responsibility from localauthorities to the State is inevitable; it is, however, desirable in the interestsof local government generally to avoid any transfer of functions which is not strictly necessary.57. We propose accordingly that local authorities should have placed on them a general duty to provide accommodation in institutions, not only for theold and. the young but for any persons needing it, though as regards able-bodiedpersons and casuals the duty should be exercised only where the authority is requested by the Assistance Board to exercise it as agents for the Board (see paragraphs 69-74).58. The duties of local authorities to provide accommodation should come under the guidance and control of the Minister of Health in England and wales and the Secretary of State in Scotland who should be empowered to require theauthorities to maintain adequate standards; and the authorities&apos; institutionsshould be subject to inspection by officers of the Ministry or of the Departmentof Health. Neighbouring authorities should have the power to co-operate in providing joint institutions for a wider area where this would be an advantage,and the Ministers should have power to require the establishment of joint boards.We do not think it necessary, pending discussions with the representatives of authorities, to specify through which committee of the Council the duty to provideinstitutional care should be exercised, but probably the Health Committee (or aSub-Committee) would be best for the purpose.59. Rights of admission. Differences of view may sometimes arise on thequestion whether a person should be assisted by the Assistance Board in his home, be cared for by a local authority in an institution or be admitted to a hospital under the National Health Service.   Admission to hospital must, we
think, be determined on medical grounds and consequently by the hospitalauthority. Some method of settling a difference of opinion between the Boardand a local authority should be available. We think the proper machinery forthis purpose would be the Appeal Tribunals of the national assistance scheme,and propose accordingly that : (1) officers of the Board should have power to decide, subject to a right ofappeal by the authority to the Appeal Tribunal, that a person (whois willing to enter) is in need of accommodation in an institution; and(2) officers of the Board should have the further power, in order to avoiddelay in urgent cases, to certify that there is an urgent need of admis-sion to an institution, which would oblige the authority to give admis-sion at once; though again the authority would have a right of appealafter doing so, and a decision of an Appeal Tribunal in the authority&apos;s favour would oblige the Board&apos;s officer to seek another way of dealingwith the case.60. Payment. As a further step towards breaking away from the old asso-ciations of parish relief and in particular the conception of an institution fa?&quot; destitute persons,&quot; we think that a resident in a local authority&apos;s Home should keep charge of whatever income or other resources he may have and pay theauthority for his accommodation and maintenance. There seems little doubt thatthe preference which many old people now show for Homes run by voluntary bodiesis due to the satisfaction they have in these Homes of handling their income andfeeling that they are paying their way.61. Each local authority institution would have a standard charge, approves,from time to time by the Ministry of Health (or Department of Health for Scot-land), approximating to the average cost. People in a position to pay thestandard charge should do so. It should also be open to authorities to provide additional comforts, in the way of private rooms for example, at additionalcharges for persons desiring to have them and able to pay for them. This wouldbe in line with the proposals under the National Health Service Bill to haveprivate rooms in hospitals, and it would help to avoid having institutions for&apos;&apos; poor persons &apos;&apos; only.62. Of those persons who could not afford the standard charge themajority (and an increasing majority as time goes on) would at least have apension or other National Insurance benefit of 26s. a week. Powers are beingtaken under the National Insurance Bill to continue payment to people in insti-tutions. Local authorities should have a minimum charge, for persons with only an insurance pension or benefit, of 21s. a week per person which would leave 5s. aweek for personal expenses. The sum to be retained by an inmate ought not, how-ever, to be rigidly fixed a troublesome inmate might be left with less than 5s. aweek; some inmates might be too infirm to use &apos;&apos; pocket money &apos;&apos; and in some cases it might be desirable to leave an inmate with more than 5s.63. If a person was not receiving a retirement pension or other insurance benefit of at least 26?. a week, and if his total resources were not such as wouldenable him to pay the authority 21s. a week and have 5s. a week left over for personal expenses, he would be advised to apply to the Assistance Board forassistance, which would be assessed on the basis of a &quot; need &apos;&apos; of 26s. a week, anyresources being treated in the same manner as on any other application for national assistance. He would thereby be enabled to pay the authority at least theminimum charge of 21s. a week.64. A person able to pay more than the minimum charge would be expectedto pay what he could within the approved standard charge, subject to his being-able to retain 5s. a week for &quot; pocket money.&quot; If the authority saw reason to doubt a person&apos;s statement about his resources they would be authorized to ask theAssistance Board to report on the extent and nature of those resources, and theywould thus avoid being involved in disputes with an applicant for admission about his ability to meet the charge they decide to make. A person wishing to contestthe Assistance Board&apos;s report would be able to appeal to the national assistanceAppeal Tribunal, who would amend the report if it appeared to them that it didnot represent the facts.65. It would be inconsistent with this conception of a &quot; hotel &quot; relationship,and would give rise to difficulty, if the local authority were required to disregardany of an inmate&apos;s resources, and we contemplate that the amount an inmate is
expected to pay would be settled (after due allowance for &quot;pocket money&quot;)according to the amount of his resources without regard, save as indicated in thenext paragraph, to the nature of those resources.66. The one exception we make to this proposal that there should be no&quot; disregards &quot; concerns capital. It may reasonably be argued that an old person who has no family to look after him, or whose family are freed by his entering the institution from the trouble of caring for him, should be expected to use anycapital he has (and to realize it where it is invested, e.g., in house property) tomeet the standard charge for so long as the capital will enable him to do so; andthat at the most, as a concession to the anxiety so often felt on this score, he shouldbe allowed to retain sufficient for his funeral expenses. The alternative is that hewill be provided with maintenance and care at less than their cost, and that hismoney will eventually go, by his will or in default of a will, to some person or body with no real claim upon him. Against this, however, must be set the strongattachment which old people in particular have for their savings and theirreluctance to use them up; and old people will be the great majority of those whom we are discussing at the moment. Though in strict logic this may be inconsistent,if the institutional provision we have in mind is to be successful we think thatinmates with a modest capital should not be obliged to draw upon it heavily. Wedo not think local authorities could do better than follow broadly the assistance board rule, i.e., to count capital of not more than  400 as equivalent to a weeklyincome of 6d. for each complete  25 after the first  25. They would follow this rule whatever the nature of the capital (i.e., without any added protection, forinstance, for &quot;war savings&quot;), but they would make no further claims on aninmate&apos;s capital either during his residence in the institution or after his death.67. As we have already said, the White Paper (paragraph 160) fore-shadowed that the provision of accommodation for such old persons as need itwould remain within the sphere of local government, and local authorities weregiven no ground to expect any financial assistance from central funds towards thecost of this service. In the case of old persons with no pension or other resources,they would therefore have had to meet the full cost of maintenance from the rates,and our proposal, under which such an old person will be put into a position tocontribute 21s. to the cost of his maintenance, is therefore in this respect morefavourable to local authorities than anything they have been given reason to expect.We have not put this proposal forward with the object of relieving local finance.Indeed, we understand that, from the point of view of the relations between central and local finance, any further transfer of expenditure to central funds, beyond that involved in the transfer of hospital services and outdoor relief, may aggravate the problem of adjusting the block grant to the new conditions. Our proposal ismade for two reasons. In the first place we think that if the old Poor Lawatmosphere is to disappear, every old person in an institution should be put into aposition to contribute substantially towards the cost of his maintenance. Secondly,we think that it is most desirable to put an end to the ancient and obsolete&quot; Law of Settlement and Removal &quot; under which Public Assistance authorities may dispute which of them is responsible for a person&apos;s maintenance and may havehim removed to his &quot; place of settlement &quot; or raise a charge against the authorityof his &apos;&apos; settlement&apos;&apos; in respect of the cost of his maintenance (see next para-graph). We think that for such a reform it is necessary to put everyone into aposition to contribute substantially to the cost of his maintenance in an institution.We regard these advantages as outweighing any aggravation of the block grantproblem that may arise from this additional transfer of cost from local to central funds.68. Settlement. The transfer to the Assistance Board of the duty of assisting people in their own homes will mean the end of the &quot; Law of settlement and Removal &quot; in relation to outdoor relief. We hope that, with the assurance of a contribution of at least 21s. a week for each inmate, local authorities willbe prepared to see an end to &quot; Settlement and Removal &quot; in relation to institu-tional care, and that the responsibility for providing institutional care will &quot; liewhere it falls &quot; i.e., on the authority in whose area the person is residing at thetime. Certainly there should be no question in the future of &quot; removing &quot; toanother area a person admitted to an institution, and (except perhaps in special cases where an arrangement is made to move a person from.one area to another forhis own benefit) there should be no recovery of charges by one authority from another.   A high standard of accommodation provided by one authority may,
however, attract an unduly large number of candidates normally resident in neigh-bouring areas, and if there is no check on this other authorities may be encouraged to fall short in the provision they make. Some residential qualification may benecessary, but we do not feel able to make any firm recommendation until our proposals for payment have been put to the representatives of local authoritiesand the question has been discussed with them. In any case we hope that if con-ditions have to be laid down they will be of a most simple and straightforwardcharacter which will leave little or no possibility of dispute.The &quot;work-shy&quot;69. The Assistance Board should retain the power (which they possess atpresent) to set up &quot;Reconditioning Centres,&quot; both residential and non-residential, and, in appropriate cases, to make it a condition of the payment ofan allowance that the applicant should enter such a centre. The centres wouldaim beyond deterrence, though the value of that is not to be minimised in thesedifficult cases. In many cases no doubt the requirement that a person should enter a centre as a condition of receiving assistance would simply mean that hewould decide to work. If he entered, efforts would be made to fit him in body andoutlook for taking employment or entering upon a course of Ministry of Labourtraining. The Board opened two day-centres in 1939, and in the short time theywere in existence until they closed down on the outbreak of war they achieved a considerable measure of success; while in many cases the deterrent effect wasenough and the man found work, the men who entered seemed generally to regaintheir self-respect and desire to re-establish themselves in a steady job.70. The size of the problem of &quot; workshyness &quot; is, however, so small thatthe normal residential Reconditioning Centre would have to be a centre for a very wide area, and as such would generally not be suitable for married men withdependants. It is for this reason that we have recommended earlier that theBoard should have a power comparable with the existing &quot; workhouse &quot; power,and should be able to make arrangements with a local authority which hadsuitable premises and would be prepared to use them for the purpose, so that an applicant to the Board might be paid allowances only if he entered this institution.In other words, in so far as a local authority had suitable accommodation avail-able the authority might be asked to act as the Board&apos;s agent and admit persons at the Board&apos;s cost.Casuals71. The casual is a special problem. He may be a person for whom, at some stage, a Reconditioning Centre would be the appropriate treatment; but there isa prior question of finding him shelter for the night.72. We think that the Assistance Board should be responsible generally fordealing with the problem of vagrancy, and in particular for making an effort to rehabilitate casuals and bring them back into the normal stream of life; thepowers of the Board should, for example, include power to set up special Recon-reconditioning Centres or to use existing centres provided by voluntary effort. At thesame time the responsibility of providing temporary accommodation is one which,on our general view of the allocation of functions between the Assistance Boardand local authorities, is proper to the local authorities. It will be impracticable for a considerable time to build new premises, and it would be wasteful to do so for this purpose when local authorities have casual ward premises which aregenerally closely connected with other institutional premises, which the authorities will have to use for other purposes, and would be best managed under the samecontrol.73. We propose, accordingly, that the Board should be empowered to actthrough agents, and that local authorities should have a statutory duty to provide accommodation for the temporary shelter of casuals, at the request and on behalfof the Board. The terms on which such arrangements would be made wouldhave to be settled with the local authorities.74. The way we think these arrangements would work out in practice is asfollows. Local authorities would set up &quot; Reception Centres &quot; at suitable placesto be decided by the Board in consultation with the authorities.   The Board&apos;s
expected to pay would be settled (after due allowance for &quot;pocket money&quot;)according to the amount of his resources without regard, save as indicated in thenext paragraph, to the nature of those resources.66. The one exception we make to this proposal that there should be no&apos; disregards &quot; concerns capital. It may reasonably be argued that an old person who has no family to look after him, or whose family are freed by his entering the institution from the trouble of caring for him, should be expected to use anycapital he has (and to realize it where it is invested, e.g., in house property) tomeet the standard charge for so long as the capital will enable him to do so; andthat at the most, as a concession to the anxiety so often felt on this score, he shouldbe allowed to retain sufficient for his funeral expenses. The alternative is that hewill be provided with maintenance and care at less than their cost, and that hismoney will eventually go, by his will or in default of a will, to some person or body with no real claim upon him. Against this, however, must be set the strongattachment which old people in particular have for their savings and theirreluctance to use them up; and old people will be the great majority of those whom we are discussing at the moment. Though in strict logic this may be inconsistent,if the institutional provision we have in mind is to be successful we think thatinmates with a modest capital should not be obliged to draw upon it heavily. Wedo not think local authorities could do better than follow broadly the assistance board rule, i.e., to count capital of not more than  400 as equivalent to a weeklyincome of Qd. for each complete  25 after the first  25. They would follow this rule whatever the nature of the capital (i.e., without any added protection, forinstance, for &quot;war savings&quot;), but they would make no further claims on aninmate&apos;s capital either during his residence in the institution or after his death.67. As we have already said, the White Paper (paragraph 160) fore-shadowed that the provision of accommodation for such old persons as need itwould remain within the sphere of local government, and local authorities weregiven no ground to expect any financial assistance from central funds towards thecost of this service. In the case of old persons with no pension or other resources,they would therefore have had to meet the full cost of maintenance from the rates,and our proposal, under which such an old person will be put into a position tocontribute 21s. to the cost of his maintenance, is therefore in this respect morefavourable to local authorities than anything they have been given reason to expect.We have not put this proposal forward with the object of relieving local finance.Indeed, we understand that, from the point of view of the relations between central and local finance, any further transfer of expenditure to central funds, beyond that involved in the transfer of hospital services and outdoor relief, may aggravate the problem of adjusting the block grant to the new conditions. Our proposal ismade for two reasons. In the first place we think that if the old Poor LaAvatmosphere is to disappear, every old person in an institution should be put into aposition to contribute substantially towards the cost of his maintenance. Secondly,we think that it is most desirable to put an end to the ancient and obsolete&apos;&apos; Law of Settlement and Removal &apos;&apos; under which Public Assistance authorities may dispute which of them is responsible for a person&apos;s maintenance and may havehim removed to his &quot; place of settlement &quot; or raise a charge against the authorityof his &apos;&apos; settlement&apos;&apos; in respect of the cost of his maintenance (see next para-graph). We think that for such a reform it is necessary to put everyone into aposition to contribute substantially to the cost of his maintenance in an institution.We regard these advantages as outweighing any aggravation of the block grantproblem that may arise from this additional transfer of cost from local to central funds.68. Settlement. The transfer to the Assistance Board of the duty of assisting people in their own homes will mean the end of the &apos;&apos; Law of settlement and Removal &quot; in relation to outdoor relief. We hope that, with the assurance of a contribution of at least 21s. a week for each inmate, local authorities willbe prepared to see an end to &apos;&apos; Settlement and Removal &apos;&apos; in relation to institu-tional care, and that the responsibility for providing institutional care will &quot; liewhere it falls &quot; i.e., on the authority in whose area the person is residing at thetime. Certainly there should be no question in the future of &quot; removing &quot; toanother area a person admitted to an institution, and (except perhaps in special cases where an arrangement is made to move a person from one area to another forhis own benefit) there should be no recovery of charges by one authority from another.   A high standard of accommodation provided by one authority may,.
however, attract an unduly large number of candidates normally resident in neigh-bouring areas, and if there is no check on this other authorities may be encouraged to fall short in the provision they make. Some residential qualification may benecessary, but we do not feel able to make any firm recommendation until&quot;our proposals for payment have been put to the representatives of local authoritiesand the question has been discussed with them. In any case we hope that if con-ditions have to be laid down they will be of a most simple and straightforwardcharacter which will leave little or no possibility of dispute.The &quot;work-shy&quot;69. The Assistance Board should retain the power (which they possess atpresent) to set up &quot;Reconditioning Centres,&quot; both residential and non-residential, and, in appropriate cases, to make it a condition of the payment ofan allowance that the applicant should enter such a centre. The centres wouldaim beyond deterrence, though the value of that is not to be minimised in thesedifficult cases. In many cases no doubt the requirement that a person should enter a centre as a condition of receiving assistance would simply mean that hewould decide to work. If he entered, efforts would be made to fit him in body andoutlook for taking employment or entering upon a course of Ministry of Labourtraining. The Board opened two day-centres in 1939, and in the short time theywere in existence until they closed down on the outbreak of war they achieved a considerable measure of success; while in many cases the deterrent effect wasenough and the man found work, the men who entered seemed generally to regaintheir self-respect and desire to re-establish themselves in a steady job.70. The size of the problem of &quot; workshyness &quot; is, however, so small thatthe normal residential Reconditioning Centre would have to be a centre for a very wide area, and as such would generally not be suitable for married men withdependants. It is for this reason that we have recommended earlier that theBoard should have a power comparable with the existing &quot; workhouse &quot; power,and should be able to make arrangements with a local authority which hadsuitable premises and would be prepared to use them for the purpose, so that an applicant to the Board might be paid alkwances only if he entered this institution.In other words, in so far as a local authority had suitable accommodation avail-able the authority might be asked to act as the Board&apos;s agent and admit persons at the Board&apos;s cost.Casuals71. The casual is a special problem. He may be a person for whom, at some stage, a Reconditioning Centre would be the appropriate treatment; but there isa prior question of finding him shelter for the night.72. We think that the Assistance Board should be responsible generally fordealing with the problem of vagrancy, and in particular for making an effort to rehabilitate casuals and bring them back into the normal stream of life; thepowers of the Board should, for example, include power to set up special Recon-reconditioning Centres or to use existing centres provided by voluntary effort. At thesame time the responsibility of providing temporary accommodation is one which,on our general view of the allocation of functions between the Assistance Boardand local authorities, is proper to the local authorities. It will be impracticable for a considerable time to build new premises, and it would be wasteful to do so for this purpose when local authorities have casual ward premises which aregenerally closely connected with other institutional premises, which the authorities will have to use for other purposes, and Avould be best managed under the samecontrol.73. We propose, accordingly, that the Board should be empowered to actthrough agents, and that local authorities should have a statutory duty to provide accommodation for the temporary shelter of casuals, at the request and on behalfof the Board. The terms on which such arrangements would be made wouldhave to be settled with the local authorities.74. The way we think these arrangements would work out in practice is asfollows. Local authorities would set up &quot; Reception Centres &quot; at suitable placesto be decided by the Board in consultation with the authorities.   The Board&apos;s
local officer would be informed of all admissions and would work in close co-opera-tion with the manager of the centre. He would decide what should be done tohelp an inmate to give up a wandering life and settle down, and take what stepshe could to that end e.g.; by consultation with the Ministry of Labour and national Service about the possibility of employment or training; by arranging for the inmate to go to a Reconditioning Centre; or by persuading aged and infirmcasuals to &quot; give up the road &quot; and settle down in the local authority&apos;s Home.V.-SPECIAL PROVISION FOR CERTAIN HANDICAPPED PERSONSFinancial assistance to Blind and Tuberculous Persons75. Among the persons living in their own homes who apply to theAssistance Board are a number who (or whose dependants) suffer from somephysical or mental disability. If the disability gives rise to extra needs otherthan purely medical needs (for example, domestic help, extra nourishment oradditional clothing), the Board can increase the weekly allowance or make lump sum grants. Two classes of disabled persons, however, the blind and thosesuffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, for whom there are special schemes offinancial assistance at present and who do not therefore apply to the Board,raise special problems.76. The level of financial assistance now provided by local authorities underthe Blind Persons Acts is generally higher than the level of the authorities&apos; own public assistance standards or the present normal standard of assistance paid bythe Assistance Board, and in a few areas it is considerably higher. The authori-ties&apos; rates vary so widely that it is difficult to express in general terms thedifference between the Board&apos;s standard and the many standards for the blind.Roughly, excluding the areas with exceptionally high or low rates, assistance given to the blind is perhaps about 10s. a week higher than the allowancesnormally paid by the Assistance Board. The general level of the allowancesunder the tuberculosis scheme (which is administered by local authoritiesaccording to standards laid down by the Ministry of Health) is probably alsoabout 10s. a week above the Board&apos;s normal standard.77. Moreover, there has been pressure from associations representing the blind to secure &quot; handicap allowances &quot; for blind persons which would be paidirrespective of whether the blind person is or is not in need; while the national association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis has represented that the national insurance benefits will not be an adequate substitute for the existing special scheme of allowances for tuberculous persons and that this scheme should becontinued. We do not think that any general claim to &apos;&apos; handicap allowancesought to be conceded. Such a concession would clearly have to extend to alldisabled persons, and this would cut at the basis of the National Insuranceprovisions for sickness. Nor do we think that the existing scheme of allowances for the tuberculous should continue as a separate scheme of financial assistanceoutside the general pattern.78. Special treatment for blind and tuberculous persons within the national assistance scheme may, however, be justified on the grounds of the strong appealto public sympathy which the condition of blindness has always made, and thegreat importance in the interests of public health of encouraging the tuberculousto give up work and undertake treatment at the earliest possible stage. Logicallythe power of the Assistance Board to make additional alkrwances to meet specificextra needs should be sufficient. Nevertheless, the fact that blind and tuberculouspersons have hitherto been put in a specially favourable position makes itexceedingly difficult to refuse them a similar position in the future. We think,therefore, that any registered blind person aged 16 or over, and any personaged 16 or over who is certified by the Tuberculosis Officer to have given upemployment to undergo treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis, should, if he isin need and applies for national assistance, be paid 10s. a week above the assess-ment of his need on the normal basis, even though his ascertained extra needsdo not require such a payment. If his extra needs could not be met by 10s. aweek the Board would pay such additional amount as was necessary.** Some blind persons above the qualifying age of 16 will still be receiving full-time educationor training under the Education Act or the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, and will beprovided with maintenance; such persons will&apos;not be in need and will not therefore be paid any allowance by the Assistance Board.
79. Under such an arrangement the majority of blind and tuberculouspersons would receive as much as or more than they would receive from their local authorities under the present arrangements. In a few areas where thelocal authority&apos;s rates of assistance to the blind are exceptionally high a blindperson&apos;s needs might be assessed by the Board at less than is paid now, and afew tuberculous persons might get less than under the present arrangements asthe Assistance Board take into account resources (e.g., a wife&apos;s earnings) whichare not taken into account under the present scheme. Examples showing theeffect of our proposal are given in Appendix III. The position of personsactually receiving more at the &quot;Appointed Day &quot; than they would receive under our proposal could be specially protected to secure that their income would notbe reduced. We may add that our proposal would cover tuberculous persons with little prospect of recovery who are excluded from the present scheme. Thisexclusion has been the most strongly criticized feature of the scheme.80. There will no doubt be pressure to secure similar treatment withinthe national assistance scheme for other disabled persons. It is important thatany such pressure should be resisted as an extension of the classes to whom thespecial addition is paid would undermine the basic standards on which the needsof applicants generally are assessed. Any such extension would moreover raiseextremely difficult problems of definition. It might be possible to define the smallclass of the &quot; deaf and dumb,&quot; but &quot; cripples,&quot; for example, would defy precisedefinition for these purposes, to say nothing of the chronically sick. Moreover,every other class of disabled persons will, stand to benefit, in comparison withtheir present position, by the National Insurance proposals, the Disabled Persons(Employment) Act and an extension which Ave propose later of the specializedwelfare services of local authorities.81. The fixing of the amount of the additional allowance for blind andtuberculous persons would probably best be left to the Regulations, but in orderto prevent an extension of the concession the Bill should define precisely the classes of persons to whom the additional allowance may be paid. It may alsobe necessary to announce the proposed amount of the additional allowance atthe Bill stage.Local authority welfare functions82. At present a great deal is done to provide for the special needs, apartfrom the financial needs, of blind and tuberculous persons. The services providedfor blind persons are highly de\.-eloped and comprehensive. They include the registration of blind persons, the teaching of Braihe, and the provision ofworkshops. All these services for the blind are the responsibility of localauthorities, though they are often provided with the aid of A^oluntary associations;and the White Paper of September 1944 (paragraph 145), proposed that theyshould remain with local authorities.83. We think, not only that the specialized services noAv provided for the blind should be continued and should remain the responsibility of local authori-ties, but that the services should be extended and adapted to cover otherhandicapped persons. There seems to be no logical reason why there should bespecial Avelfare provisions for the blind and not for cripples or for the deaf anddumb. We recognize that there are difficulties in defining the class of &quot; handi-capped persons.&quot; If the definition is draAvn too wide the class might be held to include all old and infirm people. This Avould lead to an unnecessary overlapwith the Ministry of National Insurance and the Assistance Board and would almost certainly result in local authorities appointing Social Welfare Committeesand staff to supervise and administer a general welfare service. The outcomewould be likely to be not only a duplicated and consequently extravagant systemof administration, but also the perpetuation of the Public Assistance Committeesand their staffs under a new name (in fact, the name Social Welfare Committeehas already been adopted by some authorities).84. In our view, the over-all duty of providing general welfare services for the old, the infirm, the sub-normal and others should rest with the assistance board and the Ministry of National Insurance. The powers of the assistance board in this regard would be, in effect, a continuance of the Poor Law duty tocare for all in need of assistance, and, as much of the recent work of the Boardhas shown, the most satisfactory way of providing welfare services for persons[32088] d 2
receiving financial assistance is to provide them as the accompaniment of thepayment of the assistance. Similarly, the Ministry of National Insurance willbe able to care for the welfare of persons receiving benefits under the national insurance schemes, as we understand that they intend to employ a large numberof local officers. Thus, in the new pattern of social services, there will be, outsidethe field of local government, means of providing a general domiciliary welfareservice for all who are likely to need help of this kind.85. It is for these reasons that we have contemplated a relatively narrowdefinition of the classes of person to be assisted by the specialized welfare services which would, under our proposals, be administered by local authorities. All thatwe have in mind is that the authorities should have power to provide services for all disabled persons similar to those which they are now empowered to providefor the blind. For specialized services of this kind which are akin to welfare services in the health field there is a strong case for local as opposed to central administration.86. It is possible that the powers given to authorities in the National health service Bill to make arrangements for the care and after-care of &quot; persons suffering from illness or mental defectiveness &quot; are already sufficiently wide toenable them to provide the services we propose, but we think that some extension ofthe definition in the Health Bill will be necessary. The extended definition might perhaps be : &quot; Persons substantially handicapped by reason of permanent injury or congenital deformity.&quot; We suggest that, as in the Health Bill, the new services should be made a power and &quot; to such extent as the Minister may direct &quot; a dutyof the authorities who should administer them through their Health Committees.The Blind Persons Welfare Committees would disappear. The responsible ministers should be the Minister of Health (for England and Wales) and theSecretary of State for Scotland. The services should be subject to inspection by officers of the Ministry of Health and the Department of Health for Scotland.Neighbouring authorities should have power to co-operate in providing a commonservice and the Ministers should have power to require this where they thinkit necessary.87. The services would be developed under the guidance of the responsibleMinistry, but should include in particular (1) Ascertainment of disabled persons.(2) An Information Service (i.e., the important task of seeing that disabled persons are aware of the help they can get).(3) Provision of Homes and Hostels.(4) Help in the home, including (i) Teaching of Braille to the blind; lip reading, &amp;c.(ii) Teaching of home occupations and pastimes.(iii) Supervision of home employment, including marketing.The authorities should be empowered to discharge any or all of these dutiesthrough the agency of voluntary associations and to make contributions to the funds of the associations; and, as under clauses 28 an d 29 of the National health service Bill, should have power to make charges where appropriate for theservices provided and to remit them where need is shown.88. It is possible that welfare functions of loctti authorities, even if limited in the way we propose, will to some extent overlap thu functions of the assistance board and the Ministry of National Insurance and those of the Ministry ofLabour who have powers under the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act, 1944,relating to rehabilitation, training and employment. We do not, however, think this will matter in practice. The Ministry of Labour would be responsible forthe provision of adequate wages for blind and other disabled persons employedfull-time in sheltered employment in workshops. Those unable to work full-time would, of course, be eligible for an allowance from the Assistance Board if in need. &apos; For the rest, if an officer of the Assistance Board or the Ministry ofNational Insurance thought that an applicant to his Department could benefit under the local authority welfare service, he would put the applicant in touchwith the service and use his good offices on the applicants behalf, as is so oftendone by the Board&apos;s officers to-day.89. Mental Cases.^Assistance by the Assistance Board and the specialisedservices of local authorities which we have proposed, above would be available
so far as appropriate for persons with mental disorders or defects who are living at home. To complete the picture we give in Appendix IV a brief general account of the provision to be made for persons with mental disorders or defects.VI.-RECOVERY OF THE COST OF assistance the present position90. The Poor Law contains wide powers enabling a Public AssistanceAuthority to recover the cost of relief from the recipient, from his estate, or fromrelatives (parents, grandparents and children) on whom the law places a responsi-bility for his maintenance. In England and Wales the powers of recovery from the recipient himself are strengthened if the relief is given on loan. The assistance board have no powers to recover the cost of assistance except from the recipienthimself, and then only in the very narrow circumstances mentioned in the nextparagraph.Recovery from recipients91. We do not propose a transfer to the Assistance Board of the present powers of Public Assistance Authorities to recover the cost of assistance fromthe recipient of the assistance or, if he dies, from his estate. Accordingly the conception of relief on loan will disappear, though we have raised with Ministers,in paragraphs 41 and 46 respectively, the questions whether powers should betaken to recover (a) through employers the cost of assistance given to their employees as the result of holding wages in hand, and (b) the cost of assistance given to persons engaged in trade disputes and their dependants. The assistance board should, of course, retain their present powers to recover the cost ofassistance improperly obtained by fraud or misrepresentation, and whereassistance is paid pending the receipt of national insurance benefits, non-contri-butory old-age pensions, or family allowances, there should be arrangements, onthe lines of those already operating, for preventing the duplication of paymentswhen arrears accrue. As regards persons in local authority institutions we donot propose that local authorities should have power to recover the cost of main-tenance from an inmate&apos;s estate, but no doubt powers will be required to dealwith any inmate who refuses to pay the appropriate charge.Liability of relatives92. We think that the present extensive liabilities under the Poor law should be brought to an end, and that for the purposes of assistance under theBill, whether assistance by the Assistance Board or maintenance in a localauthority institution, there should be a simple liability of spouses in respect ofeach other, and of parents in respect of their children under sixteen. This will mean the end of the present Poor Law liabilities of children to maintain parents,of parents to maintain adult children, and of grandparents to maintain grand-children.93. With the liability of a father for his children under sixteen there shouldbe included a liability for any children he has legally adopted, any children ofhis wife by a former husband, and any illegitimate children of his wife whowere already in existence at the time when he married her. In the case of a woman we think it would be unreasonable to make her liable in respect of anyillegitimate children of her husband&apos;s. All the liabilities proposed already existunder the Poor Law, except that in Scotland a man is not liable in respect ofhis wifVs illegitimate children, or in general in respect of her children by a former husband.Maintenance and Affiliation Orders94. For the enforcement of the liability in the case of deserted or separatedwives and of illegitimate children, it is desirable that both local authorities andthe Assistance Board should have the powers at present vested in PublicAssistance Authorities in England and Wales by the Poor Law Acts and theBastardy Acts to apply to the Courts for maintenance orders, &amp;c. We thinkalso that it will be desirable to retain the present special statutory provisions forrecovering from sailors and from members of the armed forces the cost of reliefgiven in their absence to their wives and children.
Penalties for neglect to maintain95. Further, though this is not a matter connected with recovering the costof assistance, we think it will be necessary to retain provisions on the lines ofthose of the Vagrancy Acts which make it possible for the Courts to punish byimprisonment a person who is convicted of having failed by his own neglectto maintain himself or any of the persons for whose maintenance he is liable,with a resulting charge to public funds.VII.-NON-CONTRIBUTORY OLD AGE pensions the present position96. These pensions (the original old age pensions of 1908) are payable onlyto persons over 70 (and blind persons over 40). Except in the case of personswho before attaining that age were in receipt of pensions under the contributory pensions Acts, they are subject to a test of means which is somewhat different fromthat administered by the Assistance Board and is in some respects more lenient,particularly in relation to capital resources. The maximum rate of pension is atpresent 10s., but in October the maximum rate will be increased to 26s., or 16s. inthe case of married women, to accord with the increases in contributory pensions.The number of old age pensions at present in payment subject to a means test isabout 400,000 : about half of the pensioners are also receiving supplementary pensions from the Assistance Board, though the proportion will be reducedconsiderably when the rate of pension is changed in October.Continuation of the scheme97. The White Paper on Social Insurance proposed that no new awardsshould be made of non-contributory old age pensions, but the Government havedecided that the scheme should be continued for a limited time, and accordinglya provision has been put into the National Insurance Bill which preserves thescheme in relation to all people who at the relevant date (i.e., next October)will be at least 55 years old : such people will (if they satisfy the other con-ditions) be eligible for old age pensions on reaching the age of 70, but peopleunder the age of 55 at the relevant date will not. The scheme will thus continue in being (though after 1961 on a diminishing scale) until the death of the lastsurvivor of the people aged 55 or over in October next, and it is necessary tomake arrangements for its administration.98. Under the statutes as they stand at present the power to make Regula-tions settling the details of the procedure rests with the Treasury. Claims for pensions stand referred to Local Pension Committees (appointed by Borough,and certain Urban District, Councils and County Councils) who, after receiving a report from the Pension Officer appointed by the Treasury, decide the claimsubject to appeal either by the claimant or the Pension Officer to-the Minister ofNational Insurance. Parliamentary business relating to the scheme is dealt withby the Chancellor of the Exchequer.99. In the past the Treasury have appointed as Pension Officers the Officersof Customs and Excise, and the detailed administration of the scheme has beenin the hands of the latter Department, subject to Treasury direction on questionsof policy; but arrangements have lately been made for the appointment asPension Officers of officers of the Assistance Board, and the Assistance Board willin the near future take over from the Department of Customs and Excise itspresent responsibilities for the day-to-day administration.100. The position of the Treasury, which dates from the inception of thescheme in 1908, has no parallel in the rest of the Insurance and Assistancearrangements, and is out of place in the new pattern of the social services. Themachinery of Local Pension Committees seems to us to be out of date, and thearrangement under which appeals are eventually decided by the Minister (i.e.,in practice by one of his officials) is contrary to the spirit of the arrangements which obtain elsewhere in the social services, particularly as we understand thatappeals usually originate with pension officers, so that they are appeals fromofficials, to officials, against what are regarded as unduly favourable decisions ofnon-officials.
The Committee&apos;s proposals101.   Accordingly we propose that (1) the Local Pension Committees should be abolished;(2) applications for pensions should be lodged with, and awards of pensionsmade by, the officers of the Assistance Board;(3) any pensioner who is dissatisfied with the decision of the assistance board officer should have a right of appeal to the Appeal Tribunalunder the national assistance scheme, whose decision will (as in theadministration of national assistance) be final;(4) the power of the Treasury to make Regulations governing procedure should be transferred to the Assistance Board, but any Regulationsthey may make should be subject to confirmation by the Minister ofNational Insurance, in the same way as the Rules which the board will be making to regulate procedural details in connexion with theadministration of national assistance;(5) Parliamentary business connected with the scheme should be dealt withby the Minister of National Insurance.Blind pensions102. A subsidiary question on old age pensions arises in respect of blind persons. Subject to satisfaction of the other conditions a blind person qualifiesfor an old age pension at age 40 instead of age 70. As already stated, theNational Insurance Bill sets a time limit upon the continuance of the non-con-tributory persons scheme for sighted persons by providing that persons who reach the age of 55 after October next shall no longer be entitled to non-contributory pensions on reaching 70. In view, among other reasons, of the difficulty of appearing to tamper with one part of the existing provision for the blind without being able to present a picture of the scheme of future provision as a whole, no corresponding time limit was placed in the National Insurance Bill upon thecontinuance of non-contributory pensions for the blind at 40. We feel, however,that it would be wrong to preserve indefinitely this special scheme of meanspensions for a small class of the community. We think, therefore, that as partof the comprehensive review of provision for the blind which noAV becomes necessary, the possibility of bringing Blind Pensions gradually to an end, e.g.,by a decision to grant no new pensions after a date to be determined, should beconsidered. If such a decision were taken this date need not necessarily be thesame as that fixed for the termination of non-contributory pensions for the sightedas the same considerations do not apply, but it may be thought desirable thatthe two dates should coincide. This would mean that after the 4th October, 1961.the general condition that, in order to qualify for a pension, a person must havebeen at least 55 years old on the 4th October, 1946, would apply to blind persons as well as sighted persons, except that those blind persons who had received old age pensions under the special arrangements for the blind would have to be allowedto retain their &quot; rights.&quot;VIII. CHILDREN103. We are unable to make any recommendations in our report about thefuture arrangements for children now cared for under the Poor Law. There arenearly 40,000 such children orphans, deserted children and others in need of care and the future provision for them is thus one of the major questions which arise in connexion with the break-up of the Poor Law. This question is, however,only part of the larger questions about children who for any reason are with-out proper parental care, and these larger questions are being examined by two other committees which have not yet reported (a committee under the chair-manship of Miss Myra Curtis for England and Wales and a committee underthe chairmanship of Mr. James L. Clyde, K.C., for Scotland). We understandthat the committee&apos;s reports may be received in a month or so. It has not beenpossible, and would not have been appropriate, for us to put forward firm recom-mendations in advance of the presentation of the rejDorts of these two committees.The question of central administration is, however, outside the terms of reference of the two committees and we were asked to examine and report on this. Weappointed a sub-committee of representatives of the Departments mainlyinterested to consider the problem and their report is attached (Appendix l!.
There was a cleavage of opinion between the Departments represented on thesub-committee and it was consequently impossible to do more in the report thanstate and examine the various possibilities in order that decisions may be taken. by Ministers.104. We should like to emphasise, as the sub-committee have done, theimportance of early action on the reports of the Curtis and Clyde committeeswhen they are available. Whether it is decided then that separate legislation will be necessary, and it may be unavoidable, to deal with the whole problemof children in need of care, or that the necessary provision can be included inthe Bill to break up the Poor Law, it will be essential that legislation shouldbe passed to come into force at the same time as the disappearance of the PoorLaw so that the children now cared for under the Poor Law will not be leftunprovided for.IX. MISCELLANEOUSCompulsory removal to Institutions105. We have referred earlier to the Assistance Board&apos;s need of powers tomake the payment of an allowance conditional upon the applicants entering aReconditioning Centre or a local authority institution. These are powers requiredprincipally for dealing with the able-bodied. There is a further problem ofthe old or infirm person who is living in a state of filth and neglect which cannotbe remedied because of his own incurably unclean habits or eccentricity or becausedomestic help cannot be found. The only satisfactory course may be to get himinto an institution, but it may not be possible to persuade him to enter of hisown accord. Recently the Association of Municipal Corporations have urgedthat local authorities generally should have a power to enforce a person&apos;s removalto an institution in such circumstances. Many authorities already possess thepower under Local Acts.106. No one would wish such a power to be exercised in any but extremecases and after every practicable effort had been made to improve the home con-ditions. There would have to be adequate safeguards for the individual. TheLocal Acts to which we have referred empower the medical officer of health toapply to the Courts, subject to giving adequate notice to the person concerned,for an order to remove to an institution a neglected person suffering from chronicdisease, or &quot; aged,&quot; infirm or physically incapacitated, who is living underinsanitary conditions. Such orders may be made for a limited period of threemonths at a time.107. The instructions of Ministers are requested in order that the mattermay be discussed with the representatives of local authorities. A proposal togive Scottish authorities a general power of the kind we have indicated was rejected in Parliament in 1984, but since then Local Acts containing the powerhave passed through Parliament without difficulty. Powers of this kind are now a standard provision of Local Acts in England and Wales and are possessed by over 70 English and Welsh authorities, including London, and by a fewauthorities- in Scotland.Registration and Inspection of Old People&apos;s Homes108. Homes for old people provided and managed by local authorities wouldbe subject, as they are now, both to the control of public opinion brought to bearthrough the Councils and to inspection by officers of the Ministry of health and the Department of Health for Scotland. In time there may be enough localauthority Homes to cater for all old people in need of institutional care, andthey may become so popular with the old people that there will be no demand forother Homes. This cannot, however, be the position for many years, and in themeantime much can be done by voluntary effort. Many of the voluntary Homesnow open are provided by important national bodies whose reputation is aguarantee that the old people will not be exploited. Many others are providedby local associations of voluntary effort (e.g., Old People&apos;s Welfare Committees)in which the best of local opinion is represented. In some eases the assistance board exercise some oversight, but they have no powers of inspection. Thereis. however, nothing to prevent an individual or private body setting up a home for old people which may be and sometimes is run on undesirable lines.
109 Local authorities have urged that voluntary Homes should be registered and be open to inspection. If this were done the local authorities who would be responsible under our proposals for providing accommodation for old people, would be the natural registration and inspection authorities Thereare certain difficulties, including the difficulty of defining an &quot;Old PeopledHome, and we propose that this question also should be discussed withrepresentatives of the authorities. We make no other recommendation on thesubject at this stage.Burials110. ( The powers of local authorities under the Poor Law include thepower to bury the body of any poor person.&quot; It will still be necessary for someauthority to provide burial where necessary, and we think the proper authorityto carry the duty is the local authority (acting through the Health Committee),which will be able to get reimbursement, in respect of persons covered by theNational Insurance scheme, from death grant awards.Redundant officers of local authorities111. The proposals we have made will mean an end of outdoor relief, andas a result officers of Public Assistance Authorities who are employed wholly or mainly in the administration of outdoor relief may become redundant. TheNational Insurance Bill would, in any case, have reduced the numbers on outdoorrelief, and representations have already been made that provision lor com-compensating officers who lose their employment should be made in that Bill and that officers of Public Assistance Authorities should be given opportunities ofemployment in &quot;the Ministry of National Insurance. The reply to the repre-sentatiqns has been that the questions of employment and compensation wouldbe considered in connexion with the legislation to break-up the Poor Law.112. The first question which arises is to what extent the officers concerned should be given opportunities of employment in the Civil Service. TheAssistance Board expect to reduce their present staff considerably from Octobernext as the number of supplementary pension cases, which form the bulk ofthe Board&apos;s present work, will then be reduced following the increases in mainpensions. Later, when the Board assume further duties on the break-upof the Poor Law, they will need additional staff and will be glad to recruitsuitable officers from the experienced officers of Public Assistance Authorities.The number of outdoor relief cases will be reduced by the National Insurancescheme, and the Board&apos;s organisation may be able to absorb them with the additionto the staff of only a relatively small proportion of the Public assistance authorities&apos; &quot;outdoor&quot; staff.113. It should be jjossible to find alternative employment for most of theresidue in the service of the authorities themselves. Under our proposals theauthorities will remain responsible for providing institutional assistance for old persons and others, and this service may expand. We have also proposedthat the authorities should have extended power to provide specialised welfare services for disabled persons. In other directions, too, local authorities willprobably be short of staff. We think it should be impressed upon the authorities that they have a large share of the responsibility for finding employment fortheir public assistance staffs, and that they should be expected to break downany inter-departmental exclusiveness which might interfere with their doing so.Nevertheless, to the extent that it proves impracticable for the local authoritiesto absorb the redundant Poor Law officers in alternative employment, we thinksuch officers should, subject to their passing a suitable test, be eligible for con-sideration for employment in suitable vacancies in other Departments of theCivil Service as well as in the Assistance Board1 e.g., the Ministry of national insurance.114. The second question is that of compensation for officers whose workcomes to an end and for whom other employment is not found. ^ We have saidthat there should be little or no staff redundancy if the authorities play their part in finding alternative employment in their own service. Probably the most effective way to ensure that they do so would be to make them responsible for compensation. To this the local authorities will doubtless take strongexception They will argue that the usual course when functions are trans-ferred is to make the authority to which the functions are transferred responsible
for compensating officers of the other authority for whom employment is not found. They will say, therefore, that in the present case responsibility for compensation should fall on the Exchequer. On the other side it can be argued that the precedents are not, in fact, all one way and that the transfers of functions now contemplated will mean a heavy transfer of expenditure from local to central funds. It would not, therefore, be unreasonable to ask theauthorities to accept the relatively small cost of compensation. It is possiblethat they would be persuaded to accept this if it were agreed that allowance would be made, in re-assessing the total of the block grant, for the estimatedcost of compensation to all authorities. Distribution would, of course, be onformula, and unrelated to the expenditure of particular authorities on com-pensation. Such an arrangement would not destroy the incentive to authoritiesto find employment for as many officers as possible. We suggest that the matter should be discussed frankly with the authorities on these lines.115. It will also be necessary to deal with the question of the local authoritysuperannuation rights both of officers who are transferred to the Civil Serviceand of those for whom alternative employment is not found; but it is not necessaryfor us to go into this matter in this report.X.-CONTENT AND TITLE OF THE BILL116. As we have indicated in the early part of the report, the broad plan is to repeal the Poor Law (and to make consequential amendments in other Actscontaining references to the Poor Law), and to provide for new services to fill the gaps which this repeal would leave so as to round off the provisions of theNational Insurance and National Health Service schemes by a comprehensiveassistance service. It would be possible for the new Bill to provide for the newservices by amending existing Acts, e.g., the various Acts under which theAssistance Board now operate. This, however, would leave a most complicated and untidy legislative position which would be out of accord with the self-contained &quot; codes &quot; of the National Insurance, Industrial Injuries, national health Service and Family Allowances Acts.117. We accordingly recommend that, so far as may be found practicable(since there are likely to be minor exceptions), existing legislation which hasto be fitted into the general pattern should be repealed and re-written into thenew Bill. We think that the legislation which will be required to complete the break-up of the Poor Law and to establish new services in its place could conveniently be included in one Bill; that &quot; National Assistance Bill &quot; would be asuitable short title; and that the long title should make it clear that the purposeof the Bill is to abolish the Poor Law and to provide for the establishment of a comprehensive system of national assistance and welfare. It is the usual practice in legislation dealing with the functions of local authorities to havetwo Bills, one for England and Wales and another for Scotland, but on this occasion we think there should be a departure from this precedent as much ofthe Bill would deal with the functions of a central Department, the assistance board, which operates for the whole of Great Britain.Signed on behalf of the Committee :A.

In the case of (1) registered blind persons aged 16 or over; and(2) persons suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis who havegiven up work in order to undergo treatment;the Bill should empower the Assistance Board to grant assistance atspecial rates. The relation of these rates to the normal rates will be amatter for Regulations after due consideration by the Board, but itappears that a margin of about 10s. over the normal rates would suffice to ensure that in general blind and tuberculous persons will notbe worse off than they are under the existing arrangements  .......78,81RECOVERY OF THE COST OF ASSISTANCE FROM RECIPIENTS18.

LIABILITY OF RELATIVES49.   The liability of relatives, which extends widely under the poor Law, should be restricted to the following :-(i) A man should be liable to repay the cost of any assistancegranted to or for his wife because of his failure to maintainher in accordance with his means, and a wife should similarly be liable to repay the cost of assistance granted toor for her husband    ................      ...      92(ii) A man should be liable to repay the cost of any assistancegranted to or for the following children because of hisfailure to maintain them in accordance with his meansbut only if they are under the age of 16 years :(a) his own children, whether legitimate or illegitimate;(b) his adopted children;(c) children of his wife by a former husband;(d) illegitimate children of his wife born before the marriage;and a woman should be under a corresponding liabilityexcept that she should not be responsible for her husband&apos;sillegitimate children ...      :.....      .........   92, 93(iii) There should be powers similar to those at present possessed by local authorities to obtain orders to enforce the aboveliabilities      ...      ......      ............      ...      94FAILURE TO MAINTAIN20. The provisions of the Vagrancy Acts under which it is a criminal offence, punishable by imprisonment, for a person wilfully to fail to maintain himself or his dependants if the failure results inchargeability to a public assistance authority should be re-enacted ina form suitable to the new scheme       ...............      95NON-CONTRIBUTORY OLD AGE PENSIONS21.

APPENDIX IChildrenReport of a Sub-Committee of Representatives of the Ministry of Health,the Department of Health for Scotland, the Ministry of education and the Home Office[The main part of this report deals with the position in England and Wales. Ashort section at the end draws attention to the more important respects inwhich the present position and the problem for the future are different inScotland. One major difference in practice is indicated earlier in afootnote.](i) The problem1. In the normal case a child grows up, until able to earn his own living and fend for himself, in the care of good parents who support him out of earnings,private means or insurance or assistance payments. The Maternity and child welfare services are available to help in his care up to the age of 5 or until heattends school; at the age of 5 or earlier he goes to the local nursery or primaryschool (unless his parents send him to a private school); at 11 he goes to a secondary school and may later, while still normally resident at home, go to a technical college, university, or other institution for higher education, in which event he may earn scholarships or the Local Education Authority may make grants to help with his maintenance. The lot of some children, however, is very different.Many are left orphans and some are deserted by their parents. Some aretemporarily bereft of parental care by, e.g., the absence of parents in hospital or by their requiring hospital treatment themselves. A child who has somephysical or mental handicap may need to be sent away to a residential schoolto receive suitable teaching. Some children living at home may be ill-treatedor neglected by their parents, and some get in trouble with the Law or are sorefractory as to be beyond parental control and have to be put under other control.2. A considerable part of the problem of caring for such children has beenunder examination by a committee, with Miss Myra Curtis as Chairman, whichwas appointed in March 1945 by the then Home Secretary, Minister of health and Minister of Education &quot; to enquire into existing methods of providing for children who from lossof parents or from any cause whatever are deprived of a normal life withtheir own parents or relatives; and to consider what further measures shouldbe taken to ensure that these children are brought up under conditions best calculated to compensate them for the lack of parental care.&quot;(ii) The present arrangements.3. The arrangements under which care is now provided for children whoare orphaned, deserted, neglected, &amp;o, are complicated by the existence side by side of the long-standing provisions of the Poor Law and the provisions of more recent legislation which to a considerable extent overlaps the Poor Law. the later legislation is much the more varied and detailed, but one of the largestsingle groups of children in this class is still cared for under the Poor Law. Thelatest available figures of children in the care of individuals and bodies not theirown parents or normal guardians are as follows : Children maintained under the Poor Law   ...      ...      About 37,000Children in the care of voluntary homes      ...      ...      About 30,000Children placed in institutions or under supervisionor boarded-out under the Children and YoungPersons Act..................      About 30,000Children in residential special schools (on account ofdisabilities, &amp;c.)     ...............      About 15,000Children placed privately in the care of foster-parents      About 13,000The number of adopted children is not known, and there is, of course, nomeans of forming an accurate estimate of the number ill-treated or neglected byparents and guardians in their own homes.
4. The Poor Law. Under the Poor Law, Public Assistance Authoritieshave a duty to provide for any &quot;poor &quot; child (a child for Poor Law purposesbeing a person under 16). About 5,000-6,000 of the children are &quot; boarded out &quot;with foster-parents at the expense of the Authorities * The Public assistance authorities are also required to provide &apos;&apos; separate schools &apos;&apos; (usually Homesrather than schools) and may send a child in their care to a &quot; school &quot; run by a voluntary body, if the &quot; school &quot; has been &quot; certified &quot; by the Minister of Healthas a &quot; fit &quot; one for the purpose, and pay the managers for the child&apos;s maintenance,clothing and education there; and they have a further power to send deaf anddumb and blind children to any school, whether &quot; certified &quot; or not, which issuitable for such children. Most of the &quot; Poor Law children &quot; are cared for inHomes. The Authorities have a general power to make annual subscriptionstowards the support of various voluntary associations from which the &quot;poor&quot;receive or may receive assistance, and among other things this power is used tocover arrangements under which deaf and dumb and blind children and other children with special needs are sent to &quot; uncertified &quot; schools.5. Under section 52 of the Poor Law Act, Public Assistance authorities may, by resolution and subject to appeal to the Courts, assume parental rightsand powers, which may continue to the age of 18, in respect of a child maintained by them who is an orphan or has been deserted, or whose parents are not capableof exercising or are not fit persons to exercise parental control by reason of mental deficiency, vicious habits or mode of life, being under sentence of penal servitude, having been sentenced to imprisonment for any offence against any oftheir children, or being permanently bedridden or disabled or inmates of a PoorLaw Institution.6. Further powers under the Poor Law enable Public assistance authorities to bind destitute children to be apprentices; to &quot; procure or assist in procuring&quot; the emigration of orphans and deserted children under 16; andto assist boys to enter the Navy.   These powers are now little used.7. There are various provisions enabling the Authorities to obtain&quot;maintenance orders&quot; against &quot;liable relatives,&quot; who include grandfathersand grandmothers as well as parents and the putative fathers of illegitimatechildren.8. The Children and Young Persons Act, 1933 (as amended and extended by an Act of 1938). The Act of&quot; 1933 consolidates much earlier legislation andcontains a large variety of provisions for the protection of children (defined aspersons under 14) and young persons (defined as persons of 14 to 17). Thefollowing is a brief summary : (1) Protection from cruelty, &amp;c, by provision for the prosecution of the parent or guardian of a child or young person under 16 who &quot; wilfullyassaults, ill-treats, neglects, abandons or exposes him, or causes orprocures him to be assaulted, ill-treated, neglected, abandoned orexposed, in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary suffering orinjury to health.&quot; &quot; Neglect&quot; includes failure to provide adequatefood, clothing, medical aid or lodging.(2) The regulation of the employment of children.(3) Children and young persons brought before the Courts on criminal chargesmay-(i) be sent to a &quot; remand home &quot;; or(ii) be sent to an &quot; approved school&quot; (the maximum age to which a&quot; young person &quot; may be kept at an approved school is 19 andhe may remain subject to supervision until the age of 21); or(iii) be committed to the care of &quot; a fit person, whether a relative ornot, who is willing to undertake the care of him &quot; (a child oryoung person may remain committed to the care of a &quot; fitperson &quot; up to the age of 18).[Under other Acts there are powers to send young persons to prison(infrequently used) and young persons of 16 or over to Borstal, and toput children and young persons on probation.]* Tn Scotland the number of children boarded-out is much the same, out of a much smallertotal number of &quot; Poor Law children.&quot; It has been in the tradition of Scottish administration to board-out rather than send children to Homes.
(4) Children and young persons &quot; in need of care or protection,&quot; or so&quot; refractory&quot; as to be beyond the control of their parents or guardians(including a poor law authority). The definition of &quot;in need of careor protection&quot; covers the child or young person (i) who having no parent or guardian, or a parent or guardian unfitto exercise care and guardianship or not exercising proper care and guardianship, is either falling into bad associations, orexposed to moral danger, or beyond control. A child or youngperson who is found destitute or wandering about without anysettled place of abode and without visible means of subsistence,or is found begging, is held to be &quot; exposed to moral danger &apos;&apos;;(ii) who is a person in respect of whom any of a number of offenceshas been committed, including the offences of ill-treatment,neglect, &amp;c, referred to above; or is a member of the same house-hold as another child or young person in respect of whom suchan offence has been committed, or of the same household as aperson who has been convicted of such an offence;(iii) who is taken from place to place by a vagrant and is prevented from receiving efficient education.The Courts may deal with &quot; care or protection &quot; and &quot; refractory &quot;cases by (i) putting the child or young person &apos;&apos; under the supervision of &apos;&apos;a probation officer; or(ii) sending him to an &quot;approved school &quot;; or(iii) committing him to the care of a &quot;fit person &quot;; or(iv) in &apos;&apos; care or protection &apos;&apos; cases, ordering the parent or guardianto enter into a recognisance to exercise proper care andguardianship.9. In addition to remand homes and approved schools the Act refers to a&quot; place of safety,&quot; which means &quot; any remand home, workhouse, or police station,or any hospital, surgery or any other suitable place, the occupier of which is willing temporarily to receive a child or young person.&quot; A child or young personmay be taken to a place of safety if there is cause to suspect that any of the offences referred to above are being committed against him; or if he is about tobe brought before the Court as &quot; in need of care or protection &quot;or&quot; refractory &quot;;or, if the Court is not able to decide at once what to do with the case, as an interim measure until the Court does decide.10. Remand homes are provided and maintained by local authorities, whoare responsible for the maintenance of children and young persons sent there.Approved schools may be provided by the local authorities, in which case theauthorities are directly responsible for maintenance, or by voluntary bodies, inwhich case the authorities &apos;&apos; contribute to the expenses &apos;&apos; of the maintenance ofthe child or young person. A &quot; fit person &quot; assumes the same rights and powersand is subject to the same liabilities in respect of maintenance as if he werethe parent. A local authority may be nominated as the &quot; fit person,&quot; and if so arerequired to board out the child or young person at their expense.11. If a child or young person is sent to an approved school or committed to the- care of a &quot; fit person,&quot; the father or stepfather, mother or stepmother andany person who, at the time the order is made, is cohabiting with the mother isrequired to make contributions, which are paid direct to the &quot; fit person &quot; if the child or young person is in the care of a &quot; fit person &apos;&apos; who is not a local authority,and otherwise to the local authority who pay them over to the Home Office subjectto deductions in respect of the authority&apos;s services. The Home Office make pay-ments towards the expenses of the managers of approved schools, the expenses oflocal authorities in respect of children and young persons committed to their care,and the expenses of local authorities in respect of remand homes.12. The local authorities for the purposes of the Act are, except for remandhome purposes, the Education Authorities. The responsible Department is theHome Office who, among other &quot;things, &quot; approve &quot; schools and are responsiblefor the inspection of remand homes, approved schools and &quot; fit person &quot; arrange-ments; by agreement between the two Departments Inspectors of the Ministryof Education advise on the work of the schoolroom.13. The Act also provides for inspection by the Home Office, either directly or through local authority officers, of &quot;any home or other institution for the
boarding, care and maintenance of poor children or young persons, being a home or other institution supported wholly or partly by voluntary contributions &apos;&apos; (butnot including homes, &amp;c, certified or approved by the Board of Control under the mental Deficiency Acts,&quot; unless children or young persons who are not mental defectives are received in them). The provision for Home Office inspection doesnot apply to a voluntary home which is.  is &amp; whole,&quot; otherwise subject toinspection by or under the authority of a Government Department, but there is nevertheless some overlapping in the responsibility of Government departments for the inspection of voluntary homes.14. The Education Act, 1944-Among their powers and duties under thisAct Local Education Authorities may : (i) provide education and maintenance in residential special schools for children suffering from disabilities of mind or body;(ii) secure the provision of boarding accommodation, either in boardingschools or otherwise, for children for whom education as boarders isconsidered desirable by their parents and by the Authorities;(iii) provide board and lodging for children and young persons who other-wise could not attend the school or college where their needs can best be provided.15.   In addition (i) Local Education Authorities are generally, as we have indicated above,the local authorities for the purposes of the Children and YoungPersons Act. Those Local Education Authorities who are willing toact as &quot; fit persons &quot; may have children and young persons committed to their care, and some of the larger Education Authorities have established approved schools and, under powers delegated by the council&apos;s, remand homes. If a parent is prosecuted under theEducation Act for failure to secure the education of a child, the Courtsmay deal with the child under the Children and Young Persons Actas being &apos;&apos; in need of care or protection &apos;&apos;;(ii) in some areas the Education Committees undertake in respect of children,as agents for the Public Assistance Committees, the functions of thelocal authorities under the Poor Law;(iii) in some areas &quot; Child Guidance Clinics &quot; are provided as part of theschool health service. These clinics are normally staffed by apsychiatrist, a psychologist and a psychiatric social worker. Theydeal with the &quot; difficult&quot; school-child, and try to remedy any psycho-logical maladj ustments by treatment of the child and, where necessary,by attempting to improve the bad home conditions which are oftenthe cause of the trouble; and(iv) in London, and to a lesser extent elsewhere, there are Care committees which generally function under the Education Committee (though thePublic Health Committee may also be concerned) and are mainlyoccupied in trying to remedy bad home conditions which stand inthe way of a school-child&apos;s obtaining the full benefit of his education.(Social work in the home may be done in the interests of children under 5 by the Health Visitors of the Maternity and Child WelfareService.)16. Child Life Protection and Adoption.-The Public Health Act, 1936,and the Public Health (London) Act, 1936, make provision for the protection of&quot; foster-children &quot; under 9 who are &quot; nursed and maintained &quot; by any person forreward. The local authorities have various duties in the control of such arrange-ments e.g., a foster-parent must give notification to the authority of his receiving a child and of any change of address; the authority appoint child protectionvisitors or authorise other persons to visit the home&quot; and satisfy themselves ofthe health and wellbeing of the children; the authority may fix the maximum number of children under 9 who may be kept by a foster-parent and imposeconditions where more than a specified number of foster-children is kept; andthe authority may apply to the Courts to have a child removed from an unsatis-factory foster-parent. The local authority for these purposes is sometimes theCounty or County Borough Council and sometimes a minor authority.17. The adoption of children is regulated by the Adoption of Children Act,1926, and the adoption of Children (Regulation) Act, 1939, which are mainly
under the central administration of the Home Office. Adoption orders are madeby the Courts. Local authorities, which for some purposes are the major authori-ties and for others may be any local authority, have various duties, including thefollowing: (i) they have in some cases functions similar to some of those described above in connexion with foster-children;(ii) they are among the bodies which may arrange adoptions;(iii) they may be appointed by the Court, with their consent, to act as&apos;&apos; guardians ad litem &apos;&apos; with the duty of safeguarding the interestsof the child before the Court, and for that purpose investigating allthe circumstances of the child and the adopter and all other mattersrelevant to the proposed adoption.18. The War Orphans Act, 1942, This Act makes it the duty of theMinister of Pensions to provide for the care of children for whom pensions orallowances are payable in respect of the death of a parent in the war and whoare suffering from neglect or want of proper care. The Ministers guardianshipmay continue till the child is 21. In respect of any child or young person for whom the Minister has this duty he may be nominated as the &quot; fit person &quot; underthe Children and Young Persons Act.The White Paper Proposals19. The White Paper of September 1944 (Cmd. 6550) merely proposed(paragraph 160) that &quot; the care and maintenance of orphaned and desertedchildren [should] remain within the sphere of local government.&quot;(iii) Future arrangements20. The abolition of the Poor Law raises as regards children much the same kind of questions as it does as regards adults, namely: -(1) it has to be decided how far the provision now made under the Poor Lawneeds to be continued, extended or adapted;(2) it is desirable to substitute for the present complex schemes and authorfties a simpler pattern of administration and to ensure that theprovision to be made is comprehensive;(3) It is necessary to decide what authority should be responsible in future,both centrally and locally.21. We considered that we cannot at this stage make recommendations about the extent to which the provision now made under the Poor Law needs to be continued, extended or adapted, or about the integration into a new andsimpler pattern of this and the other provision made under other Acts. We can see, for example, that it will be necessary to find a substitute for the Poor Lawpower and duty to provide sustenance and care for the destitute child, and thatthe list of relatives (including grandparents) on whom the Poor Law places a liability for maintenance needs to be brought into line with the provisions of theChildren and Young Persons Act and the proposals of the main committee; but these and other matters can best be considered when the report of the CurtisCommittee is available and the whole field of the care of children who need carecan be considered in the light of that report.22. Although we suggest, therefore, that consideration of such questionsmust be deferred for the present, it will be necessary to reach conclusions on thereport of the Curtis Committee, and to re-examine the whole field in the lightof that report, as a matter of urgency when the time comes. If legislationproviding for the &quot; Poor Law children &quot; is to be part of separate legislationproviding for the care of children over a wider field, which may be unavoidable,it must obviously be passed to come into force at the same time as the national assistance Bill. If it is to be part of the National Assistance Bill, it may bethat that Bill should also deal with children other than the &quot; Poor Lawchildren.&quot; In either event there will be little time to deal with a very important problem.23. In order that as much as possible might be done at this stage we were asked to consider what would be the best administrative framework for future arrangements. This is part of the field which the Curtis Committee are considering, and we have been in touch with that Committee and have been able
to learn something of the direction in which their recommendations on thisquestion are likely to go. We were, however, unable to reach an agreed conclusion in the sub-committee, and accordingly we decided that our best course would beto set out the possible courses we have examined.  We do this below.Local A administration24. We are agreed, as we understand the Curtis Committee to be, that ifthe care of children without proper parental care is to be a duty of the localauthority that duty should be placed on one branch of the authority and. not, as now, be divided between different committees.25. A Children&apos;&apos;s Committee. We understand that the Curtis Committeewill recommend that a new Children&apos;s Committee should be set up with its ownChief Officer and staff, and a majority of us share this view. The functions ofsuch a Committee would be to exercise parental responsibility in respect of aconsiderable group of homeless children, and, as the Machinery of government committee recognised (meeting of the 2nd May, 1945, paragraph 4 (iii)), this isa function clearly distinguishable from responsibility for education or health.The advantage of such an arrangement would be that the Committee and chief officer would be wholly concerned with providing an adequate substitute for goodparental care for those children who lack it and not be distracted from thatprimary duty by their other, and perhaps more time-consuming, concern withthe education of all children (as the Education Committee and its Chief Officermight be) or with the health of all children and adults (as the Health Committeeand its Chief Officer might be). Those of us who are in favour of the establish-ment of special Children&apos;s Committees do not think that, on this view of whatis required, a special Children&apos;s Sub-Committee of some other Committee, witha Children&apos;s Officer subordinate to the Chief Officer of the main Committee,would, except perhaps in a few areas of small population, meet the need.26. The main criticism of the proposal that there should be a Children&apos;sCommittee with its own Chief Officer is that in some local authority areas thenumber of children for whose care they would be responsible would be too smallto justify a separate Committee, or to make the appointment of a fully qualifiedofficer practicable. The number of such areas would, however, be reduced if thework of the Committee were extended to include, in addition to the care of home-less children, such services as those now given by Child Guidance Clinics and care Committees. Where Care Committee work is highly developed (as it is inLondon) it calls for the services of many more officers than, say, the supervision of boarding out arrangements. It might also be possible to make the Children&apos;sCommittee responsible for approved schools, remand homes, and the regulationof the employment of children. In areas where, even with such additions, thework would be too limited, special arrangements would need to be made.Adjacent areas might combine to form a Joint Children&apos;s Board or they mighteach appoint their own Committee, but share the services of a Children&apos;s Officer.Or again, it might have to be accepted that in some areas the Children&apos;s Com-mittee would be a sub-committee of, say, the Education Committee and that theEducation Officer, who in a small area would have more time to devote to thework, would have also the duties of a Children&apos;s Officer.27. The Education Committee. The Ministry of Education are opposedto the creation of a special Children&apos;s Committee and desire to see its functionsassigned to the Education Committee. This is also the view expressed to theCurtis Committee by the Association of Education Committees, the Associationof Municipal Corporations and the London County Council. The Ministry&apos;sargument in favour of making the Education Committees responsible is that the modern view of education goes far beyond mere schooling, that in consequencethese Committees already, in practice, cover most of the field, and that they could take over full responsibility with a minimum of inconvenience and the best prospect of bringing the right attitude and background to the work. Further,the use of the Education Committees for the purpose would avoid the objectionto the special Children&apos;s Committees that in many cases the problem would be too small to justify the employment of a Chief Officer and staff of sufficientstanding, with the not very satisfactory alternative of joint committees, &amp;c.28. General Welfare Committee. The second alternative to a specialChildren&apos;s Committee would be a General Welfare Committee concerned also with the provision of accommodation for old people and for the welfare services for disabled persons which the main committee propose.  We do not favour this
although, administratively, there are some attractions in the idea. Among theobjections to it is the possibility that such a committee, concerned with such alarge and undifferentiated section of the classes of persons now dealt with underthe Poor Law, would savour of the old Public Assistance Committee under a newname. The proposal would probably not be welcomed by public opinion whichwishes to see the treatment of homeless children dealt with as a special problem.Central A administration29. We understand that the Curtis Committee will recommend that centralresponsibility should rest on a single Government Department and not as nowbe divided between the Home Office, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry ofEducation, but will not recommend, not being required to do so, which Depart-ment it should be. We are all in agreement with this view, and agree also thata means should be found to bring together, to assist that Department, theexperience of all three Departments. In the opinion of the Ministry of Healththere should in particular be the same Chief Medical Officer for all three Depart-ments as there is now for the Ministries of Health and Education.30. The selection of the Department which should be responsible depends upon the decision of Ministers on the local administration. If it is decided thatthe Education Committee should be responsible locally the responsible central department would naturally be the Ministry of Education; and similarly theMimstry of Health would naturally be the responsible central Department witha General Welfare Committee locally; with in each case some form of AdvisoryCouncil to make use of the experience of all three Departments. If, however,either the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of Education were selected, therewould be some difficult residual problems to solve in the transfer of Home Officefunctions.31. If it is decided that there should be special Children&apos;s Committeeslocally there seem to us to be two alternatives :  (i) that the Home 0&apos;office should be the responsible Department, with an advisory Council including nominees of the other two Departments.The arguments in favour of such an arrangement are that the HomeOffice is already the responsible Department under the Children and young Persons Act and represents the Government in international conferences on the general question of the care and protection ofchildren; and that the Home Office would be less likely to be distractedfrom the primary duty of providing &quot;parental&quot; care by a priorconcern for health or education. The main objection is that in thepublic mind the Home Office may appear (though incorrectly) to be primarily concerned with delinquency;(ii) that a Statutory Board should be set up to deal solely with the problemof the child lacking proper parental care. The Board would consistof persons with experience of the problem; the staff would be drawnat the outset from the Home Office and the Ministries of Health, and education to bring together the accumulated experience of all three;and there might also be an Advisory Council representing the three departments. Under such a scheme the Minister responsible toParliament would be the Home Secretary; but the statute, whilegiving him responsibility in respect of general policy, would haveto specify the powers and duties entrusted to the Board. Such anew Department would be able to give an undivided interest to theprovision of &quot;parental&quot; care, and would be able to develop adistinctive spirit and outlook of its own. On the other hand theidea of setting up a central Board for this purpose has already beenconsidered and rejected by the Machinery of Government Committee,and it may well be thought that a problem which is relatively sucha small one would not justify the creation of yet another GovernmentDepartment.32. An Executive Board. There is one more alternative which should be mentioned! a Board which would be responsible for the local administrationthrough their own officers, as the Assistance Board are, as well as for the central administration. There is probably little doubt that direct administration by theCentral Government would be in the best interests of the children themselves;at least there would be a uniform standard of administration in place of the inevitable inequalities between one local authority and another.   On the other
hand so much is being withdrawn from the sphere of local government that itmay be undesirable to withdraw more, and if there is any direction in which local government might be expected to give of its best it would be in the care of the less fortunate children of the area. Moreover, to withdraw this work would be strongly resented! by local authorities who take a great interest in the welfare of their children.(iv) Scotland.33. The foregoing paragraphs of this appendix deal with the position inEngland and Wales. So far as Scotland is concerned, the statutory provisions dealing with homeless children, though contained! in separate Scottish enactments,do not differ in substance from those which apply in England and Wales. the responsibilities of the various classes of local authorities do not, however, corres-pond in all respects with those of local authorities in England and Wales; andat the centre the Scottish position differs materially. The responsibilities whichin England are divided among the Home Secretary, the Minister of Health andthe Minister of Education rest in Scotland on the Secretary of State; and thequestion of their allocation among his various Departments is a matter of domestic organisation.34. The position of homeless children in Scotland is at present being reviewed! by a separate Scottish committee under the chairmanship ofMr. J. L. Clyde, K.C.; and until the report of that committee has been received and considered it would be undesirable to take any final decisions as to the modifications which should be made in the existing law relating to the allocation of responsibility among local authorities of different types, and the internalarrangements of these authorities for the discharge of their respective duties.So far as concerns the allocation of responsibility among the various departments of the Secretary of State, any modification of the existing position can, as already indicated, be given effect by administrative action and will not involve an amendment of the law. In the circumstances of Scotland, there appears to beno case for considering the establishment of a Statutory Board of the kind whichhas been suggested for England and Wales.Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee :A.

APPENDIX III.Comparison of the existing standards of assistance for blind andtuberculous persons with the hypothetical sums such persons would receive from the assistance board under the committee^ proposals.(1)Blind Persons.The table below shows the application, in a variety of circumstances statedin the column headings, of the committee&apos;s proposals, i.e., the current Unemploy-ment Assistance Regulations rate plus 10s. for each blind person, and the published scales of a number of local authorities. The authority&apos;s rate isin heavy type where it is higher than the comparable rate under the committee&apos;sproposals. Of the 56 instances where comparable rates are given the assistance board&apos;s rate is higher in 43 and lower in 13. We believe the figures given are reasonably accurate for these examples, but it will be necessary later to obtainmore precise information on the practice of local authorities in order to test the comparison. On the information at present available we have not been able togive comparable figures for blind persons who are not householders.	Householder living alone. Rent 10s.

In relation to mentaldisorders and defects &apos;&apos; hospital treatment&apos;&apos; will have a wide meaning,and will include the care of any person for whom the close supervision of a residential institution is necessary for his own protection or forthe protection of others.(4) In addition the local authority, as the &quot; Local Health Authority,&quot; willhave the following powers and duties -(i) the duty, hitherto discharged by relieving officers, to take stepswhere appropriate to secure the admission of a mentally dis-ordered person to a mental hospital;(ii) the duty to ascertain what persons in the areas are mental defectives (the local Education Authority also have this dutyin relation to children);(iii) the duty to take steps where appropriate to secure the admissionof a mentally defective person to an institution;(iv) the duty in other cases of mental deficiency to provide &quot; super-vision &quot; or, where a &quot; guardianship &quot; order is given, to make provision for the guardianship. A &quot; guardianship &quot; order hasthe effect of giving the guardian in relation to a mentallydefective person of whatever age the powers of a parent inrelation to a child A.e., it takes the management of the affairs of an adult defective out of his own hands and puts it in thehands of the guardian;(v) the power, and if so directed by the Minister the duty, under clause 28 of the National Health Service Bill to provide &apos;&apos; care and after-care&quot;; and the power under clause 29 to providedomestic help.If a mentally disordered or defective person living in the community is aged16 or over and cannot support himself he will either be eligible for national insurance benefits or, if he is in need, an application for national assistance canbe made by him or on his behalf. A mentally defective child will either be livingwith a parent who is in employment, has other means, is eligible for national insurance benefits or, if in need, can apply for national assistance which would cover his dependants; or the child&apos;s needs may be provided for by the localauthority under &quot; guardianship &quot; arrangements or under their general responsi-bilities for children who are orphaned, &amp;c.The border line institutional cases of persons whose condition does not require&quot; hospital treatment,&quot; but who need institutional care because they have nobodyable and willing to look after them, would be covered by our general proposals about institutional assistance.
