Organisation, is being drawn up by a special commission in Paris. This commis-sion is also considering the necessary arrangements for establishing a Free Portregime for the Port of Trieste.In respect of the new frontiers of Italy and Yugoslavia through the disputedarea of Venezia Giulia the Council accepted the French line. The effect of thisis that Italy retains Tarvisio, Gorizia and the Mouth of the Isonzo, whilstYugoslavia obtains the rest of the disputed area (including Pola) which is not included in the free territory of Trieste.3. Italian Colonies.The Council decided that all that should be included in the Treaty was anarticle by which Italy renounces her rights and titles, that the present adminis-tration would continue and that the final disposal would be made in accordancewith the declaration by the Four Powers. This declaration will provide for continued study of the question by the Deputies and the Foreign Ministers andfor the despatch by them; of commissions to the spot to ascertain the views of theinhabitants. On receipt of these commissions&apos; reports the Deputies will submit recommendations to the Foreign Ministers. If the Four Governments cannot agree within one year of the coming-into-force of the Treaty, they undertake toput into effect the recommendations of the General Assembly of the United&quot;Nations. The declaration provides for consultation with &quot; other interested governments&apos;&apos;; and there is a United Kingdom reservation that this phrasespecifically includes those States which took an active part in the conquest of the territories, in order to cover the Dominions.--&apos; 4. Reparation.This question was at last settled in so far as the U.S.S.R. is concerned byan agreement that the Soviet Union should obtain 100 million dollars over aperiod of seven years to be made up of :  (a) Capital deliveries to be found from surplus war plant and Italian assets in the Satellite countries, the value of which will be assessed by thefour Allied Ambassadors in Rome.(b) Deliveries from current production which will not start before two years from the coming-into-force of the Treaty. The Union of soviet socialist Republics will furnish raw materials to facilitate thesedeliveries. Italian reparation to other Allies has been reserved forthe Peace Conference.5. Other Political Decisions.The cession of the Dodecanese to Greece was agreed, the islands to bedemilitarised.In order to enable the Ministers to arrive at decisions on the Franco-Italian Frontier and the South Tyrol, technical committees went into the hydro-electric situation in the disputed areas. On the basis of these reports the Councilaccepted the French claims, whilst France has given the guarantees to maintainwater and power supplies to Italy in respect both of the Mont Cenis plateau andthe Upper royal Valley. On the question of the South Tyrol the Council confirmedits earlier decision that the Italo-Ausfrian Frontier should remain unchanged,but Italy will be asked to guarantee free movement of passengers and goodsbetween North and East Tyrol. &apos;It was agreed that the Representatives of the Great Powers concerned in therespective capitals should jointly be responsible for a period of eighteen monthsf or supervising the execution of the treaties.Agreement was also reached on the subjects of War Criminals and BilateralTreaties.6. Military Decisions.It was agreed that all Allied Forces would be withdrawn from Italy within three months of the coming-into-force of the Treaty and the Russians confirmedtheir previous acceptance of the same provision for Bulgaria. The limitations onthe armed forces of the Balkan countries and Finland were agreed.There was further discussion about the Italian Navy. The identity of the units to be left to Italy was settled and the Russians at last agreed that the cruiser Savoia should be given to Greece. The only outstanding question is now the provision of the balance of the surplus units between the Four Powers.   The
United Kingdom Delegation has maintained its objections both to giving one ofthe Littorio battleships to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or to agreeing that, once three equal shares have been agreed by the Naval experts, lots&quot;shouldbe drawn to determine the allocation of the three shares between the Union of soviet Socialist Republics, the United States of America and the United Kingdom.[The French share, though equal in tonnage with the other three, has beenarranged to suit the special requirements of the French Navy.]7. Economic Questions.Apart from Reparation (see 4 above), agreement has been reached on a numberof economic clauses : e.g., restitution, renunciation of claims, and debts, whilst anumber of other clauses of lesser importance are nearly agreed.8. Austria.The United Kingdom and United States Delegations tried to obtain agree-ment that the Deputies should be instructed to consider drafts of a Treaty withAustria. M. Molotov refused to agree to this unless the Council first discussed and accepted in principle a paper which he circulated, and which containedreferences to the need for accelerating measures of denazification in Austria andthe removal of displaced persons and refugees. He alleged that most of the latter were Fascists and had fought for the Germans and were a danger to austria and neighbouring countries. I refused to accept the clause about denazification,since it reflected on the Austrian Government and the Allied Control Authority,whose case had not been heard. While admitting that the displaced personsconstituted a serious problem, Mr. Byrnes and I argued strongly in favour ofbeginning discussions on a Treaty without waiting for a solution of the question.After much discussion M. Molotov would only agree that the Allied ControlAuthority should be asked to report on the questions he had raised, and thatthe Council of Foreign Ministers should discuss this report and the question of aTreaty at its next meeting.In accordance with Cabinet instructions arising from the recent Russianorder confiscating large amounts of property in Eastern Austria as being german assets, the United Kingdom Delegation proposed that the Council should set upa four-power Commission to advise about the definition of German assets un austria, and circulated a proposed definition. M. Molotov evaded discussion ofthis question, and it was not possible to secure agreement on it. The matter isbeing pursued through the diplomatic channel.9. Main Outstanding Points.It had been agreed previously to refer certain questions to the PeaceConference : e.g., Bulgarian reparation, Greco-Bulgarian Frontiers, Hungarian-Czech Frontiers.The Peace Conference will now also have to decide on all the points onwhich final agreement was not reached at this last meeting in Paris. The mostimportant of these are : (a) the Danube, on which the Russians refused to agree to a joint Four-Power Declaration which I proposed;(b) compensation for damage  to United Nations  property,  where  theRussians are standingout for partial compensation only, whereas theother three Delegations maintained that compensation must be madein full, though for the most part in local currency;(c) the special provisions relating to oil and shipping in Roumania;(d) the commercial relations provisions.The Peace Conference will also have to consider the proposals for the statute for the free territory of Trieste and the arrangements for the Port of Trieste,which are now being worked out by the special commission appointed by theForeign Ministers.
