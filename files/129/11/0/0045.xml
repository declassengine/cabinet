TOP SECRET.Copy No.[t js recguested that special care be takento ensure the secrecy of this  documentPALESTINE.STATEMENT OF POLICY.1. The British and United States Delegations have now examined as awhole the recommendations of the Anglo-American Committee of Enquiry andhave arrived at a common viewpoint on the broad principles of a policy forcarrying out these recommendations. The following summary of these general principles is submitted for consideration by the two Governments.Displaced Persons and the Position of European Jews.2. There are two aspects to this problem-(i) re-settlement in Europe, and(ii) emigration to countries outside Europe.The Anglo-American Committee recognised that the overwhelming majorityof displaced persons, including a considerable number of Jews, will continueto live in Europe. One of our objectives should, therefore, be to create conditionsfavourable to the re-settlement of a substantial number of displaced personsin Europe.3. The only areas in Europe in which our two Governments can directlycontrol these conditions are the British and United States Zones of Germany and austria. In these areas, they are prepared to assist native Jews to resettle once more in German and Austrian communities. All available means are being usedto eradicate anti-semitism. Concentration camp survivors receive special treat-ment as to rations, financial assistance, housing and employment. Moreover, bothAmerican and British authorities are pressing for an early decision on plans,at present under quadripartite examination, for the restitution of propertyconfiscated by the Nazis. We recommend that all further practicable steps shouldbe taken to make possible the resettlement of displaced persons in those zones.4. Italy and the four ex-enemy satellite States will be required by the peace treaties to secure to all persons under their jurisdiction human rights and thefundamental freedoms, and it may be hoped that this will promote in thesecountries conditions favourable to the resettlement of displaced persons.5. Elsewhere in Europe our two Governments must rely on action throughthe United Nations to give practical effect to the provisions on human rights inthe Charter. They should support the establishment of a Commission for human rights, and also such measures of implementation as the United Nations mayadopt to ensure the protection of these rights, to the fullest extent practicable.Through their support of the efforts of the United Nations to re-establishpolitical and economic stability in Europe, our Governments will continue tocontribute to the restoration of those basic conditions which will make possiblethe reintegration in Europe of a substantial number of displaced persons,including&quot; Jews.6. Though substantial numbers of displaced persons may be resettled inEurope, new homes must be found elsewhere for many of those, including Jews,whose ties with their former communities have been irreparably broken. As theAnglo-American Committee pointed out, Palestine alone cannot provide forthe emigration needs of all Jewish victims of Nazi and Fascist persecution. Thetwo Governments should therefore proceed at once with measures designed to aid the resettlement elsewhere of other Jews and displaced persons. These will include the following : (a) Continuing support, through the United Nations, for the establishmentof the International Refugee Organization which will be capable ofdealing effectively with the problem of refugees and displaced personswhole.
(b) Strong support for the appeal to be made at the forthcoming general assembly of the United Nations calling on all member governments to receive in territories under their control a proportion of thedisplaced persons in Europe, including Jews.   In doing so, it shouldbe emphasised that the United Kingdom Government has already accepted a commitment to promote the resettlement of about 235,000Polish troops and civilians and their dependants.    In addition, alarge proportion of the refugees admitted during the period of Nazipersecution have remained in the United Kingdom.     Of these,approximately 70,000 are Jews.   With respect to the United States&apos;,275,000 refugees have been permanently resettled there, includingj    180,000 Jews.   On resumption of the normal flow of immigration toI    the United States some 53,000 quota and non-quota immigrants fromI    those European countries from which the displaced persons are drawnwill be able to enter as permanent residents every year.   It may beassumed that in the fiscal year ending the 30th. June, 1947, the large majority of these immigrants will be dews and other displaced persons.I   The President of the United States is prepared to seek the approval of]   Congress for special legislation for the entry into the United Statesof 50,000 displaced persons, including Jews.(c) Simultaneous, though separate, approaches to the Governments of theBritish Dominions, who should be informed of the action taken and proposed, and should be invited to support the appeal to member governments of the United Nations and to receive a number of displaced persons in territories under their control. Both Govern-ments, in their approach, would emphasise the weight of the influence which could be exerted by the example of action by the Dominions,the United Kingdom and the United States, in inducing other united nations to correspondingly liberal action. The United KingdomGovernment would further stress the relations between the settle-ment of displaced persons and the problem of Jewish immigration into Palestine. The United States Government would indicate thatthe arrangements it could undertake for an emergency quota would be favourably influenced if assurances had been given that a number of displaced persons would be resettled in the British Commonwealth.(d) Continued active support to the Inter-Governmental Committee onRefugees and, through it, to the resettlement of as many refugees anddisplaced persons as practicable. Active consideration is already being given to a premising proposal for the transfer of displaced persons to Brazil. The number to be resettled there is estimated at200,000 or more. Similar proposals relating to other South american countries are also being explored.7. We recommend that, simultaneously with the announcement of the new policy for Palestine, our two Governments should make a statement on the lines indicated in paragraphs 2-6 above. Arab opposition to the admission of 100,000Jews to Palestine will be much stronger if this movement begins before any indication has been given that steps are being taken to promote the resettlement. of Jews and other displaced persons in Europe and to secure that other countriesreceive a share of those for.whose emigration provision must be made.Palestine.8. We accept the principles laid down in Recommendation 3 of the Reportof the Anglo-American Committee, that Palestine as a whole can be neither a jewish nor an Arab State, that neither of the two communities in Palestine shoulddominate the other, and that the form of government should be such as to safe-guard the interests in the Holy Land of the three great monotheistic religions.We recommend that any form of government adopted should be based on these principles. We also endorse the ultimate objective, set forth in the Report, ofsecuring self-government for the inhabitants.The various alternatives to proceeding with the implementation of therecommendations of the Anglo-American Committee have been considered. It is our view that some alteration in the present governmental situation in Palestinehas to be made and made speedily. To attempt to continue the present situation would involve the imposition of a policy by the exertion of military force and against the resistance of either or both of the two peoples of Palestine.
In the present situation in Palestine the imposition of a system of government by external authority could only be avoided either (a) by the termination of theMandate and withdrawal of British troops, which would lead to such internecinewarfare by the Jews and Arabs as to make such a course unthinkable, or (b) byagreement among the Jews and Arabs themselves, of which there seems to be no present prospect.Since some degree of compulsion will probably have to be employed it shouldbe employed in setting in motion a system of government based on Recommenda-tion 3. The degree of such compulsion may be minimised and perhaps evenacquiescence secured by wise and practical implementation of thatRecommendation.The crux of the governmental problem in Palestine is to find a con-stitutional system which, while observing the principles of Recommendation 3,will best make possible progress towards self-government. The Report puts forward no detailed suggestions for this purpose and our main task has^therefore been to devise a method for its attainment.We have considered an Instrument of Government on unitary bi-nationallines based on parity between the two peoples in its legislative and executive functions, with provision for emergency action by the Administering authority in the event of absence of willingness on the part of the two peoples to parti-participate in the functioning of such a plan, or in the event of a deadlock in suchgovernmental machinery.In view, however, of the expressed reaction of the two peoples to the Reportof the Anglo-American Committee, we believe that the following plan is morepracticable and that effect could be given to it with less difficulty.Plan for Provincial A utonomy.9. Territorial Areas. The plan envisages the division of Palestine intofour areas : an Arab Province, a J wish Province, a District of Jerusalem and a district of the Negev. The Jewish Province will include eastern Galilee, mostof the Plains Of Esdraelon and Jezreel, the Beisan area, Haifa, the Plain ofSharon (excluding the town of Jaffa) and a portion of the southern coastal plain.The Jerusalem District will include Jerusalem, Bethelem and their immediateenvirons. The Negev District will consist of the uninhabited triangle of wasteland in the south of Palestine beyond the present limit of cultivation. The ArabProvince will include the remainder of Palestine.The population of these areas will be approximately as follows : A arabs. J eivs.Arab Province     .........      815,000 15.000Jewish Province   .........      301,000 451,000Jerusalem District ......        96,000 102,000Negev District      ...      ...      ...    The Provincial boundaries will be purely administrative boundaries, defining the area within which a local legislature is empowered to legislate on certainsubjects and a local executive to administer its laws. They will in no sense befrontiers and they will consequently have no significance as regards defence,customs or communications. In our view, however, it is of great importance tomake it clear that, once settled, these boundaries will, not be susceptible of changeexcept by agreement between, the two Provinces. We recommend that a pro-vision to this effect be embodied in any Trusteeship agreement and in anyinstrument bringing the plan into operation.10. Division of Powers. The Provincial Governments will have power oflegislation and administration within their provincial areas with regard tomunicipal and village administration, agriculture, fisheries, forests, land registra-tion, land sales, land settlement, land purchase and expropriation, education,public health and other social services, trade and industry, and local roads,irrigation, development and public works. They will also have power to limit thenumber and determine the qualifications of persons who may take up permanent residence in their territories after the date of the introduction of the plan.&apos; TheProvincial Governments will be required by the Instrument of Government whichestablishes the fundamental law to provide for the guarantee of civil rights andequality before the law for all residents. They shall not, in their legislation or administration, impose obstacles to free inter-territorial transit, trade orcommerce.For the purpose of carrying out these functions the Provincial governments will have power to appropriate funds, to levy taxes, excluding customs and excise
duties, to borrow within the Province, and, with the consent of the CentralGovernment, to borrow abroad.Control of foreign exchange and currency shall, for the time being, be a function of the Central Government. The Central Government shall also forthe time being be responsible for the licensing of imports. It shall allocatelicences equitably between the two Provinces after consultation with their repre-sentatives. Within two years of the introduction of the provincial autonomyplan (unless a later date is agreed to by the Provinces and the Central Govern-ment) a broad allocation of the value of import licences between the two Province;shall be made from time to time by the Central Government, in consultation withthe Provinces. Thereafter the Provinces shall have the right to obtain for theirresidents licences up to the amount of the allocation and to decide to what classesof goods such licences shall be allocated. At a date not later than the31st December, 1946, import licensing shall be on a non-discriminatory basis asbetween sources of supply.If Palestine becomes a member of the United Nations or any specialised agencies thereof (including the International Monetary Fund, the international bank, or the proposed International Trade Organisation) the Provincial Govern-ments must deal with all relevant matters within their jurisdiction in a mannernnnsistent with the obligations of Palestine as a member of these bodies.In cu-^xuxuh wiurd wm oe reserved initially to the CentralGovernment exclusive authority as  to police, -orisons, courtsrailway facilities and Haifa harbour, posts and telegraphs,civil aviation, broadcasting and antiquities, though certain of these powers will be transferred in whole or in part tothe provincial governments as soon as it becomes practicable.The Central Government will in addition have power to borrowmoney,  to make financial grants to the Provinces, to providefor inter-territorial and international irrigation anddevelopment.projects, to facilitate inter-territorial and international trade and commerce and communications and toprovide for arterial highways.      It will he empowered toexamine and verify municipal and provincial accounts,  to prescribe suitable and uniform methods of accounting, to prescribe the uses of any funds granted by it to the Provinces,and to  examine proposed budgets of provincial expenditures, andto make recommendations with respect to them.Immigration will be administered by the Central Government.So far as the Provinces are concerned, the Central Governmentwill authorise the immigration desired bjr the respectiveProvincial Governments, to the extent to which the economicabsorptive capacity of the Province will not therebj^ be exceeded.      It shall not have power to, authorise immigration into either Province in excess of any limitations imposed bythe Provincial Government.All powers not expressly granted to the provincial governments will be reserved to the Central Government.Government. .A provincial legislature may provide that any residents of the JerusalemDistrict designated by it may be represented in the provincial legislature if tneyso de^1Je;jExecutive consisting of a Chief Minister and a Council of Ministers willbe appointed in each Province by the High Commissioner from among the membersof the Legislative Chambers, after consultation with its leaders.If a Provincial Government fails to perform a proper governmental functionor exceeds its proper function, the High Commissioner will have authority toexercise emergency powers within the Province for the performance of thatfunction or to prevent such excess.12.   The Central Government. The executive and legislative functions of      .)the Central Government will initially be exercised by a High Commissionerappointed by the Administering Authority.  He will be assisted by a nominated
Executive Council composed of the heads of the major executive departments.Certain of these departments will be headed, as soon as the High Commissionerdeems practicable, by Palestinians.A Development Planning Board will be established by the High Commissionercomprising the heads of the appropriate central executive departments and repre-sentatiyes of each of the Provinces. This Board will initiate plans for the general economic development of Palestine and will supervise the implementation ofsuch plans. A Tariff Board will also be established on similar lines to advise oncustoms and excise policy and on the rates of duty to be imposed.13. The Jerusalem District. In the Jerusalem District there will beestablished a council with powers similar to those of a municipal council. Themajority of its members will be elected, but there will be certain members designated-nated by the High Commissioner.The Central Government in respect of the Jerusalem District will have thesame powers to limit the number and determine the qualifications of persons who may take up permanent residence in that District as are conferred on provincial governments in respect of their Provinces.Powers not delegated to the District Council will be exercised in the jerusalem District by the Central Government.14. The Negev District. The Negev District will be held under directadministration by the Central Government pending a survey of its developmentpossibilities. Within five years and upon the completion of this survey, the administering Authority shall submit to the appropriate organ of the united nations recommendations, arrived at after consultation with the Arab and JewishProvinces, concerning the disposition of the area.15. Considerations in the Adoption of the Provincial Plan. The following are the main advantages of the plan for provincial autonomy : -The plan offers to the Jews an opportunity to exercise a wide measure ofcontrol over immigration into one part of Palestine and to forward in theJewish Province the development of the Jewish National Home. At the sametime it offers to the majority of the Arabs of Palestine their own political institu-tions in an Arab Province and freedom from the fear of further jewish immigration into that Province without their consent. It makes it possible togive practical effect to the principles of government enunciated in Recommenda-tion 3 of the Anglo-American Committee; and it offers a prospect of developmenttowards self-government of which there is less hope in a unitary Palestine. it provides a means of segregating Jew and Arab to an extent which shouldsubstantially reduce the risk of a continuation of widespread violence and disorder in Palestine.In the long term, the plan leaves the way open for constitutional develop-ment either towards partition or towards federal unity. The association ofrepresentatives of the two Provinces in the administration of central subjectsmay lead ultimately to a fully developed federal constitution. On the contrary,if the centrifugal forces prove too strong, the way is open towards partition.The provincial plan does not prejudge this issue either way. The administering authority will be prepared to hand over the government to the people of thecountry as soon as the two communities express a common desire to that end and present an agreed scheme which will ensure its stable administration.In arriving at the provincial autonomy plan, as preferable on grounds ofpracticability to the unitary bi-national plan, we are not unmindful of thefact that there are inherent in it certain difficulties : (a) The plan calls for immediate decision on the highly controversial matterof the boundaries of the respective provinces. It is one on Avhich feelings on bothsides are apt to run high.(b) The Jewish and Arab populations are so interlaced in the area out ofwhich a Jewish Province would have to be created that a very serious minorityproblem would arise in that province which would not be involved in theproposed Arab Province. The argument may be made by the Arabs that if.itis proper to submit such a large segment of the Arab population to a majority rule by the Jews in the Jewish Province those same considerations would support their own contention that a Palestinian State be set up in which there wouldbe a majority of the Arabs and a minority of the Jews. Under the proposedsystem, however, there would be effective protection for the Arab minority inthe Jewish Province.

During the first five years of the plan the presidingI officers of those Chambers will be appointed by the High Commissioner. There-1 after they will be elected by the Chambers from among their members. BillsI passed by these Legislative Chambers will become law only after they have receivedI the assent of the High Commissioner, representing the Administering Authority,1 but assent will be denied only if such Bills are inconsistent with the Instrument ofGovernment.A provincial legislature may provide that any residents of the JerusalemDistrict designated by it may be represented in the provincial legislature if they so desire.An Executive consisting of a Chief Minister and a Council of Ministers willbe appointed in each Province by the High Commissioner from among the membersof the Legislative Chambers, after consultation with its leaders.If a Provincial Government fails to perform a proper governmental functionor exceeds its proper function, the High Commissioner will have authority toexercise emergency powers within the Province for the performance of thatfunction or to prevent such excess.12.

Considerations in the Adoption of the Provincial Plan. The following are the main advantages of the plan for provincial autonomy : The plan offers to the Jews an opportunity to exercise a wide measure ofcontrol over immigration into one part of Palestine and to forward in theJewish Province the development of the Jewish National Home. At the, sametime it offers to the majority of the Arabs of Palestine their own political institu-tions in an Arab Province and freedom from the fear of further jewish immigration into that Province without their consent. It makes it possible togive practical effect to the principles of government enunciated in Recommenda-tion 3 of the Anglo-American Committee; and it offers a prospect of developmenttowards self-government of which there is less hope in a unitary Palestine. it provides a means of segregating Jew and Arab to an extent which shouldsubstantially reduce the risk of a continuation of widespread violence and disorder in Palestine.In the long term, the plan leaves the wray open for constitutional develop-ment either towards partition or towards federal unity. The association ofrepresentatives of the two Provinces in the administration of central subjectsmay lead ultimately to a fully developed federal constitution. On the contrary,if the. centrifugal forces prove too strong, the way is open towards partition.The provincial plan does not prejudge this issue either way. The administering authority will be prepared to hand over the government to the people of thecountry as soon as the two communities express a common desire to that end and present an agreed scheme which will ensure its stable administration.In arriving at the provincial autonomy plan, as preferable on grounds ofpracticability to the unitary bi-national plan, we are not unmindful of thefact that there are inherent in it certain difficulties : (a) The plan calls for immediate decision on the highly controversial matterof the boundaries of the respective provinces. It is one on which feelings on bothsides are apt to run high.(b) The Jewish and Arab populations are so interlaced in the area out ofwhich a Jewish Province would have to be created that a very serious minorityproblem would arise in that province which would not be involved in theproposed Arab Province. The argument may be made by the Arabs that if. itis proper to submit such a large segment of the Arab population to a majority rule by the Jews in the Jewish Province those same considerations would support their own contention that a Palestinian State be set up in which there wouldbe a majority of the Arabs and a minority of the Jews. Under the proposedsystem, however, there would be effective protection for the Arab minority inthe Jewish Province.
(c) The proposed boundaries are such that the land and other economic resources in the Jewish area are superior to those in the Arab area. TheJewish area would be well able to support the requisite governmental services ofthe Provincial Government. The Arab area would not now be able to supporteven the present level of services, much less the improved services which the recom-mendations of the Anglo-American Report urge as necessary to raise the Arabstandard of living. This difficulty is met by the general power given to theCentral Government to make grants to provinces and by the specific provisions in a later paragraph for meeting the anticipated deficiencies in the budget ofthe Arab Province during the earlier years of the autonomy plan.After considering the foregoing difficulties, we feel that the provincial autonomy plan is the preferable one for meeting Recommendation 3.Holy Places.16. It will be the duty of the Central Government to safeguard the Moslem,Jewish, and Christian Holy Places. An inter-denominational Council will beset up to advise the Central Government on all matters relating to the ChristianHoly Places.Land Policy.17. In putting the provincial autonomy plan into effect the administering authority will rescind the Land Transfers Regulations of 1940. The prohibitionor frustration of provisions in leases stipulating that only members of one race,community or creed may be employed on or in connection with the land leasedwill be a matter for action by the provincial authorities.Immigration.18. . Under the provincial autonomy plan immigration will he administered by the Central Government separately for the Arab Province, the Jewish Province,and the Jerusalem and Negev Districts. In effect, immigration into the Provinceswill be regulated by the provincial Governments, subject only to the power ofthe Central Government, which may impose limitations upon immigration inaccordance with the economic absorptive capacity of either Province. these provisions will probably mean the complete exclusion of Jewish immigrants fromthe Arab Province, but will result, under ordinary circumstances, in immigration into the Jewish Province on whatever scale is desired by its Government. Thegrounds on which the Central Government could curtail the immigration quotasproposed by the Provinces will be defined in the Instrument of Government andm any trusteeship agreement or other instrument approved by the united nations. The provincial authorities will, therefore, be able to appeal to theUnited Nations against any decision, in respect of immigration which theyconsider to be in contravention of the terms of such instruments.On the assumption that our proposals for provincial autonomy are adopted asthe policy of our two Governments, we recommend the acceptance of Recommenda-tions 2 and 6 of the Anglo-American Committee.19. We have considered the memorandum embodying the results of thepreliminary discussions held in London from the 17th to 27th June on Recom-mendation 2 of the Anglo-American Report, and we endorse the Outline plan for the movement of 100,000 Jews to Palestine.We recommend that this plan be initiated immediately it is decided to put the constitutional proposals into effect.We recommend that every effort should be made to complete the operationwithin twelve, months of the date on which .the emigration begins. We recom-mend that the necessary immigration certificates should be issued as rapidly aspossible. As regards the rate of movement, shipment will proceed at themaximum rate consistent with the clearance of the transit camps in Palestine.For the purpose of checking illegal immigration, any Jews entering Palestineillegally after the plan has been initiated will be counted against the 100,000.The Arab Programme.20.   We accept Recommendations 5 and 9 of the Anglo-American Committeethat the economic and educational standards of the Arabs should be raised, subject     jto the proviso that the pace at which such development can be undertaken willhave to be limited by practical considerations such as the provision of trained
personnel and the capacity of the economy of the area to absorb a large spendingprogramme. A tentative plan has been worked out by the Palestine Governmentwhich can form the basis of the programme.(a) Health and Social Services. We endorse the proposals for a health service for the Arabs of a standard similar to that established for the Jews.We also contemplate the establishment of social services ancillary to education and health, e.g., institutions for the care of mothers, children and the old, schoolfeeding, playgrounds, unemployment assistance, the teaching of handicrafts, youthand cultural organisations.(b) Education. The immediate provision of compulsory education for theArabs is not practicable, but universal primary education could be achieved in tenyears except as regards girls in the smaller villages. Immediate steps should betaken to improve primary, secondary and university education in the Arab com-munity.(c) Economic Measures. Improved facilities for education and for health and other social services will not alone bridge the gap between the standards ofliving of the two communities; a wide economic advancement must accompanythem.The greatest part of the Arab rural community, which constitutes 66 per cent,of the whole Arab population, consists of a peasantry living at about bare sub-sistence level. There are few village industries and Arab industry in generalprovides very little employment. Measures to improve Arab economic conditions must be directed primarily to the agricultural population, but should also includemeasures to promote the development of light industries. The principal measuresenvisaged are the following : (i) Agrarian reorganisation to rationalise and consolidate land holdings.(ii) Improvement in the use of land :  promotion of regional development:prevention of erosion : agricultural research.(iii) Promotion of light industries and development of local crafts and industries.(iv) Provision of cheap credit.(v) Expansion of labour organisations,(vi) Promotion of the co-operative movement.(d) Living Conditions. We also recommend the following measures for improving living conditions in the Arab community : (i) Improvements in housing and promotion of housing schemes,(ii) Survey and town planning with a view to improvement schemes,(iii) Improvement of water supplies.21. The cost of the foregoing proposals is discussed in later paragraphs.Development Projects.22. We believe that the need for economic development in Palestine shouldbe recognised as merely a part of a broader situation with respect to economic development in the countries of the Middle East. In any statement which is madeto the interested parties or to the public, it should be emphasised that our Govern-ments have assisted and welcomed the advent of the States of the Middle Eastinto full political equality. They have observed with interest the examination by those States of their possibilities for economic development, which appear tobe great. If it is the desire of any of those States to resort to international agencies for aid by loan or otherwise in exploring and effectuating such projects,as for example in the reclaiming or improvement of great areas by water controland irrigation, they will receive sympathetic support.Certainly most substantial Palestinian development should be linked with developments in Trans-Jordan and probably in Syria and the Lebanon.We recommend that a survey of the water resources of Palestine and, withthe consent of the Government of Trans-Jordan, of water resources common tothe two areas should be undertaken as soon as possible by consulting engineersof international repute. They should further be invited, if adequate data forthe purpose is available, to draw up an outline project indicating the best useof the water available. This project should be considered, and action on it taken,by the Central Government in consultation with the Development Board, to which for this purpose the Government of Trans-Jordan and of any other neighbouringState affected would be invited to send representatives.
s23. Long-term development schemes which are wholly within one Provincewill be financed by borrowing internally or abroad by the Provincial Govern-ment or an appropriate organisation in the Province. In the event that the borrowing is from abroad it is possible that the loans will have to be guaranteed by the Central Government. Long-term development schemes which involve bothProvinces or perhaps neighbouring countries will require participation by theCentral Government but it will be desirable for the Provincial Governments totake as much responsibility as is practicable in day-to-day administration andparticularly in finance. The financial support of such projects should ultimately be made the responsibility of the Provinces in proportion to the benefits whichthey derive. Schemes financed by loans should be self-liquidating and as suchthey can be secured on revenues from the projects reinforced when necessary by a general charge on provincial revenues.Finance.24. We have considered various estimates of the cost of carrying out themeasures set out above. We have also considered the effect on the Palestinebudget of introducing the proposed scheme of provincial autonomy. We havebased our conclusions on two assumptions; first, that the cost-of-living indexwill not rise in Palestine, and, secondly, that there will be no increased expend!-ture on law and order coupled with loss or revenue due to disorders and non-co-operation.On the first of the points, it is clear that the programmes envisaged willconstitute an inflationary influence, but against this a large part of expenditureswill be for imported goods financed with external money. In addition,substantial borrowing of savings within Palestine may be assumed and increasing supplies of imported goods at lower prices should become available.Should our assumption be incorrect, it is not possible to estimate the effect onthe Palestine budget, but cost-of-living subsidies involving expenditure of up to  4 million might be necessary. Equally, disorders and non-co-operationmight add significantly to expenditures and reduce revenues.25. The Jewish Programme. According to our studies the total costs ofthe immigration of the 100,000 Jews can be put at approximately  70 million,made up as follows :  Transitional assistance   ...      ...      ...      ...        6,000,000Housing     ..................      14,000,000Capital investment to provide employment     ...      50,000,000Since it is essential to complete the programme as soon as possible, we assume that the whole  70 million will be spent within two years. The maximumexpectation from reparations available for Palestine is  5 million; from con-tribution by world Jewry  20 million; and from loans to be raised in Palestine,whether in Palestine pounds or in sterling,  35 million. This would give a totalof  60 million for the Jewish programme, leaving a deficit of  10 million, whichcan be met by self-liquidating loans.26. The Jewish Agency has publicly accepted responsibility for costsconnected with the immigration of 100,000 Jews to Palestine. This financial responsibility should be confirmed, but there would be no need to ask the agency to agree to any of our specific estimates. In due course the responsibility inquestion will be transferred to the Government of the Jewish Province.Our studies indicate that  10 million of required capital cannot beprovided from Jewish sources within the next two years. As, however, this deficiency is for purposes suitable for self-liquidating loans, it can be met byloans under the $250 million credit provided for in paragraph 29.27. Financial Effects of Provincial Autonomy. A rough distribution ofexisting expenditures and revenues on the basis of the division of responsibilityamong the Central Government, the two Provinces and the Jerusalem Districtindicates that (a) The Central Government will continue to incur more than half of thepresent expenditures of the Palestine Government. It will have an estimated surplus of the order of perhaps  1 million.
(b) Revenues of the Jewish Province will be substantially in excess ofexpenditures, giving rise to a surplus of  1,400,000.(c) Expenditures of the Arab Province, will be substantially in excess ofrevenues, giving rise to a deficit of  2,100,000.Since expenditures in the programme for the benefit of the Arabs would be.concentrated entirely in the Arab Province, the deficit of  2,100,000 in that province will be increased by an amount which might run to  1 million annuallyas an average in the first five years.From this total recurrent deficit of roundly  3 million there may be deducted possibly as much as  1 million representing excess revenues of theCentral Government subject to grants to the Province. There will remaincurrently a net deficit in the neighbourhood of  2 million. The United kingdom delegation proposes to recommend His Majesty&apos;s Government to ask Parliamentto assume ultimate responsibility for recurring deficits up to the time whenincreased revenues permit it to be met out of Arab Provincial or Central Govern-ment funds.28. Cost of the Arab programme. We have attempted to estimate the costof a practicable programme, using as a guide the estimate of costs made in a survey by the Palestine Government. That survey was made on the basis of a programme spread over the whole of Palestine. The concentration of the pro-gramme in the Arab area would, in any case, make it necessary to revise these estimates. We have allowed for this, and also for such limitations as theprovision of trained personnel and the capacity of the Arab economy to absorba large spending programme. Allowing for such considerations we think thata spending programme of up to  15 million to  20 million over 10 years shouldbe regarded as fully adequate to implement the recommendations for improvededucation, health, and economic services of the Anglo-American Committee. Inaddition  10 million should be provided for credit facilities.There are, however, so many unknown factors in the carrying out of sucha programme that it would be most unwise to commit ourselves to any public statement as to the amount of the programmes to be undertaken. Of the Arabprogramme  10 million for credit facilities could be secured from local bankcredits. Of the remainder of the programme, only a small portion iwould &quot;be suitable for the self-liquidating loans dealt with under paragraph 29. Provisionof an additional  12,500,000 at this time will, it is believed, care for expendituresufficient to ensure that the programme will be effectively carried forward tothe period when means of additional financing may be found. The UnitedStates Delegation has therefore agreed, as a part of its contribution to the general programme, to propose to the President of the United States that he recommendlegislation granting $50 million to the Government of Palestine for the purposeof financing development schemes not suitable for self-liquidating loans and for assisting in the meeting of extraordinary expenses during the difficulties of the transitional period.29. Capital for Development. A large portion of the capital needed forthe self-sustaining projects mentioned in paragraph 22 must come from outsidesources. It is possible that Palestine could obtain a loan from the international bank if she should become a member. The United States Delegation proposes,in the event that adequate finance from other sources such as the international bank is- not available, to recommend that the President seek legislation authorising the making of loans through an appropriate agency for the develop-ment of the Middle-East region, including Palestine, up to $250 million.- 30. Public Order. It is clear that the difficulties of introducing thepolicy which we have outlined Avill be greatly enhanced so long as there are inexistence armed organisations, Arab and Jewish, determined in the last resort to oppose by force any solution which is not to their liking. We agree that private armies constitute a danger to the peace of the world and ought not to exist, and that attempts to prevent by violence the execution of the policy once it has been put into effect should be resolutely suppressed. We agree that tothis end it is necessary that armed organisations which are not prepared tosubmit themselves to the full control of the Central Government should bedissolved and that the illegal holding of arms and explosives should bevigorously combated.31. Future Procedure. We recognise that, in view of the existing situation in Palestine, any policy for that country will probably have to beintroduced without the willing consent of either community.    On the other
hand, there is a degree of sustained and determined resistance of either Jews orArabs beyond which no policy could be enforced. An effort to obtain at least a measure of acquiescence from the Arabs and Jews would, therefore, be anessential preliminary to the introduction of the above proposals. We therefore recommend that, if these proposals are adopted by our two Governments, theyshould be presented to Arab and Jewish representatives as a basis for negotia-tions at a conference to be convened by the United Kingdom Government.32. In accordance with Recommendation 4 of the Anglo-American Com-mittee, we propose that the new policy should be embodied in a trusteeship agreement for Palestine. The conference with Arab and Jewish representatives should therefore be convened in time for its results to be available before theopening of the second part of the first session of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations. If the results of the conference were such as to suggest thatthe new policy would meet with a sufficient degree of acceptance in Palestine,the Government of the United Kingdom would proceed to put the plan intoeffect and would inform the General Assembly that practical considerationsrequired this to be done under the existing Mandate, but that they would presson as quickly as possible with a trusteeship agreement and would hope to lay a draft before the General Assembly at its next (1947) session. It would thenbe possible simultaneously to inaugurate the policy in Palestine and to under-take the consultations provided for in Article 79 of the United Nations Charter.33. We are not able at this stage to make recommendations regarding thecourse to be adopted if the conference with Arab and Jewish representativesled to the conclusion that the introduction of the policy proposed would be soviolently resisted by one or both of the two peoples in Palestine that it couldnot be enforced. In that situation further consultation between our twoGovernments would be necessary.
