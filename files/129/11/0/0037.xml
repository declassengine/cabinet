Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 287.l%th July, 1946.CABINET.THE GOVERNMENT AND THE UNIVERSITIES.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.1. In connection with my responsibilities in the scientific field I have become increasingly uneasy about the capacity of the Universities to meet the greatlyincreased needs of the community for University-trained men and women; andI circulated to the Lord Presidents Committee a paper (L.P. (46) 160) in whichI set out some of the general issues with which we seem to be faced. Papers were subsequently circulated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (L.P. (46) 179), theSecretary of State for Scotland (L.P. (46) 177) and the Minister of Education(L.P. (46) 174); and there was a general discussion on the subject at a meetingof the Lord Presidents Committee held on Friday, the 12th July (L.P. (46)25th Meeting, Minute 2).2. The Lord Presidents Committee thought it would be useful if I circulated to the Cabinet a short note summarising the points that were raised and the conclusions reached by the Committee.3. There was general agreement that, as matters stand, there is no certainty that the Universities will be able fully to play their part in the mobilisation oftalent, without which progress at home will be retarded and our capacity to compete overseas impaired. Many questions require investigation, such as theexpansion of existing Universities and Colleges, the creation of new ones, the reform of London University, the scope and status of the civic Universities, thedistribution among the Universities of the ablest students, the salaries and status and method of appointment of University teachers, and the way in which the universities are governed. The State is now bearing a considerable proportionof the expenses of the Universities (about two-thirds), and the question arises whether the existing administrative machine ensures adequately that theExchequer grants are used to best advantage and in accordance with national policy.4. As immediate measures, the Lord Presidents Committee agreed thatthe terms of reference of the University Grants Committee should be amended to enable the Committee to play a more positive part in University development.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with the Minister of education and the Secretary of State for Scotland, will take an early opportunity ofrejuvenating the membership of the Committee, drawing partly on persons ofwide and varied educational experience outside the University world. He isarranging for a series of sub-committees to be set up to deal with particular problems, on which a number of outsiders will serve in addition to a nucleus ofmembers of the University Grants Committee itself. He is also strengthening the staff of the Committee.The University Grants Committee is being asked to report on the practicableexpansion of Universities and University Colleges in this country in the next ten to fifteen years, including the question of the establishment of a newUniversity, and also on the general lines of development of Universities andUniversity Colleges during that period.[32166]
5. These steps will tide over the immediate difficulties and will not involve any radical alteration of the existing relations between the State and the Univer-necessities such as might raise opposition in the Universities and deflect their energiesfrom the immediate and urgent task of making an effective recommencement of activities in October next.6. There are, however, many long-term problems to be examined. Oughtthere to be a small Cabinet Committee of the Ministers directly concerned withUniversity matters or a Privy Council Committee for the Universities? Oughtthe Universities to be brought within the sphere of responsibility of the Ministerof Education and the Secretary of State for Scotland ? Is a Committee requiredto consider what expansion should be made of University provision on the Artsside? The Lord Presidents Committee agreed that these and other general questions of the relations of the State to the Universities should be examined bythe Machinery of Government Committee, reinforced with the assistance of theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Education. In the firstinstance, some of the fundamental issues involved will be thrashed out at theofficial level, with the assistance of the University Grants Committee, and themain issues of principle can then be put to the Machinery of Government Com-mittee. Obviously there is room for a wide divergence of view on how to securethe necessary efficiency of the Universities in carrying out their essential functionswhile preserving the independence which they cherish and which has its place inthe organisation of a democratic society.7. At a later stage it will be necessary to consider whether a RoyalCommission or Royal Commissions should be appointed to consider various long-term problems, such as the internal constitution of certain Universities. TheSecretary of State for Scotland is anxious to secure that at that stage a separateCommission or Commissions be appointed in respect of the Scottish Universities.I suggest that we should leave this issue over until the occasion arises, when itwill be seen whether the questions to be put to a Royal Commission are so general in character that it would be best to look at the whole question for England and scotland or whether the questions are particular to individual Universities ortypes of University, in which case there might well be considerable advantage insetting up a separate investigation for Scotland.H. M.Privy Council Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1,19% July, 1946.
