SECRET. Copy No.3 8CP. (46) 299.26th July, 1946.CABINET.CIVIL  SERVICE  HOURS  AND  LEAVE.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. The following proposals recently made by me to the Lord presidents committee were approved by :that Committee on the 19th July (L.P. (46) 27thMeeting, Item 6). The Prime Minister has asked that they should be submitted tothe Cabinet.2. The Coalition Government undertook to apply to the Civil Service theprovisions of the Restoration of Pre-War Trade Practices Act, 1942, and theStaff Side of the National Whitley Council are pressing for an early ,return, inaccordance with that undertaking, to pre-war hours of work and annual leave.3. Before the war the hours of work for the clerical, &amp;c, classes in Londonheadquarter offices were nominally 7 a day for 6 days a week = 42. But, asSaturday afternoons were usually half-holidays, the normal hours were in fact38^. In the provinces the clerical, &amp;c, staffs worked 44 hours a week, endingat lunch-time on Saturday. Both these figures &apos;38  in London and 44 in theprovinces are gross hours including meal intervals. The official luncheoninterval was 45 minutes a day, and there was no recognised allowance for tea orother breaks, so that the net hours each week were 34f in London and 40j in theprovinces.4. The pre-war entitlement for leave varied according to status and lengthof service from 18 to 48 days a year a Saturday morning off counting as afull day.5. During the war the staff were called upon to work much longer hours,and the leave entitlement was cut down to a maximum of a fortnight. But, byprogressive alleviations, the standard working week has now been reduced to45^ hours both in London and in the provinces, and the maximum leave entitle-ment has been raised to 30 days.6. The pre-war arrangements were open to certain objections. The Londonhours actually worked were too low and too sharply differentiated from theprovincial hours. As against this, before the war it was increasingly the general practice for commercial and business houses to give their office staffs at least every other Saturday morning off. There has been growing pressure from the CivilService for some such arrangement to be extended to them.7. The Civil Service leave arrangements, whereby large numbers of thestaff in the senior and middle grades were entitled to 48 days&apos; leave, were alsocriticised as being too generous. But it is fair to add that this criticism ignoredthe fact that most senior civil servants were unable to take their full entitle-ment of leave, and also that in the Civil Service, unlike business, a Saturday morning off counted as a day&apos;s leave.8. I recommend that, instead of reinstating the pre-war arrangements, weshould substitute a scheme on the following lines :  (1) A nucleus staff should attend on Saturday mornings and arrangements,should be made to allow civil servants to have alternate Saturdaymornings off. The effect would be that, apart from the Post Office-manipulative grades, most non-industrial civil servants would workan 11-day fortnight.[32121]Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1946.
(2) When a civil servant takes an additional Saturday morning off as partof annual leave, it should count as a half and not a whole day.-(3) In recognition of (1) and (2) above  &apos;(a) the pre-war leave entitlement should be reduced as follows :  An entitlement of 48 days should become 36 days.An entitlement of 36 days should become 27 days.An entitlement of 24 days should become 21 days.(b) the London hours, reckoned on a fortnightly basis and inclusive of meal intervals, should be increased from 77 to 83 : but nochange should be made in the hours of provincial staffs, whichshould remain at 88 per fortnight. -(4) Since the official meal interval of 45 minutes a day (to include not onlylunch but also tea and any other break) is honoured more in the breachthan in the observance, it should be increased to 70 minutes in Londonand 60 minutes in the provinces. The net hours actually worked,excluding meals, would thus be 71^ per fortnight in London and 78per fortnight in the provinces.9. I recommend this proposal as a logical and coherent scheme, which shouldHave substantial attractions from the point of view both of Departments and ofthe staff. As the next step, I propose, if my colleagues agree, to authorise theTreasury to open negotiations on it with the staff representatives.H. D.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,26^ July, 1946.
