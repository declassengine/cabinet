THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 264.8th July, 1946.CABINET.WAR PENSIONS: POST-INJURY MARRIAGE-TEN YEARS&apos; time limit.Memorandum by Minister of Pensions.THE pressure for the removal of the bar on the payment to the disablementpensioner of allowances for his wife and family where marriage took place morethan ten years after the end of his war service has become so strong that I feel bound to bring the matter to the notice of my colleagues.2. In November last (OP. (45) 300) the Social Services Committee recom-mended to the Cabinet that my proposal to recognise the post-injury wife andchildren both during the life-time and after the death of the pensioner shouldbe accepted. The Chancellor of the Exchequer in OP. (45) 326 opposed therecommendation as far as it concerned the disabled man during his life-time.Following consideration of both papers by the Cabinet (CM. (45) 61st Conclusion,Minute 1) a compromise was effected which took the form of a decision that thepayment of allowance in respect of post-injury wives and children should belimited to cases where marriage had taken place within ten years from the endof the pensioners war service. The decision was embodied as one of the Improve-ments in War Pensions announced in Command Paper 6714 of December 1945.3. The pressure to abolish the time limit comes from both sides of the House,including particularly the Labour Party Services Group, from the British Legion,the British Limbless Ex-Service Men&apos;s Association, various War Pension Com-mittees and other organisations, as well as from large numbers of individualpensioners.4. I myself have never approved of the imposition of a time limit; nor have i ever had much faith in the argument that to give unconditional allowances forthe post-injury wife and family would have repercussions on the industrial injuries Scheme which provides no allowances for the wife and family of the pensioner while he is in work.5. There was perhaps some justification for the principle that for pensionpurposes account should be taken only of those family commitments contractedbefore the pensioner sustained his disablement. An exception to this principle was made by the Coalition Government when in 1943 they announced the recog-nition of the wife and family of the unemployable pensioner irrespective of thedate of marriage. The principle was further abandoned when in December lastthe wife and family of a marriage occurring within ten years after the end of the pensioner&apos;s war service were recognised.6. This time limit is regarded all round as arbitrary and inequitable. More-over, the general experience of the Dominion Governments, which initiallyattempted to apply a time limit in similar circumstances, has been that when theperiod fixed was about to expire the limit had either to be extended or abandoned.7. My defence has been that the provision recognising the. post-injury wife and family was introduced to meet the criticism that men who wisely postponedmarriage until their return to civil life were penalised, and that the government&apos;s decision to pay allowances where marriage took place not within two or threeyears of the end of war service but within ten years was a generous one. that defence, which I myself have always thought to be a weak one, has impressednobody.[32107]
8. The critics argue that it is quite inequitable that an allowance should be dependant on the fortuitous circumstances of when the marriage took place. Itis true that the ten-year time limit has not yet operated in the case of disablementpensioners of the 1939-45 War. But it operates in the case of pensioners ofthe 1914-18 War and particularly harshly because such pensioners, unlikepensioners of the recent war, were not forewarned.To take an example from the 1914-18 War : Two men of the same rank may have been wounded on the same day and be pensioned, say, at the rate of 70 per cent, for amputation of the leg.One man married just outside the ten-year limit the other just within it. Both have a wife and two children; the first gets 31s. Qd. a week, thesecond 49s. a week.9. There is one particularly hard type of case, namely, that of the man who was married within ten years of the end of his war service but whose wifedied. If he remarries after the expiry of ten years from the end of his war service (and he may not have become a widower within the time limit) he cannotbe granted an allowance for his second wife. It is particularly difficult todefend the refusal of an allowance to the wife and children of the secondmarriage where there are children of the first marriage for whom allowances are paid.10. Naturally the bulk of the criticism comes from pensioners of the1914-18 War and their representative associations. But the agitation will increase as the time approaches when the bar will operate in respect of pensionersof the 1939-45 War. It has been suggested that consideration of the questionof abolishing the time limit should be deferred until that time arrived. I donot agree with such a suggestion. To remove the limit at such a time would only increase the grievance of the pensioners of the 1914-18 War because the bar will have operated against them in the intervening years when it did not affect the pensioners of the recent war, and they will only have benefited when thelatter became sufficiently vocal to obtain removal of the bar which, as it turned out,only threatened but never affected them.11. Abolition of the bar could hardly be seriously opposed on financial grounds as it would, I estimate, cost not more than f million pounds a year. Itwould have no repercussion on pensions for widows since no marriage time limit is applied in their case. It would, in my opinion, have no repercussion on theIndustrial Injuries Scheme. But it would, I am confident, remove a very realgrievance and strengthen the Government in resisting the demand for a SelectCommittee.12. I therefore ask for the support of my colleagues to my proposal thata disablement pensioner should be awarded an allowance for his wife and familyirrespective of the date of his marriage.W. P.Ministry of Pensions,8th July, 1946.
