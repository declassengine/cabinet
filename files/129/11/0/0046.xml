Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1946.SECEET. Copy No.CP. (46) 296.24th July, 1946.CABINET.TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING (DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS) BILL.Memorandum by the Minister of Town and Country Planning.AT their meeting on the 15th November, 1945* the Cabinet approved inprinciple the proposed heads of legislation annexed to CP. (45) 275 and authorised me to prepare a Bill. Some modifications have since been consideredby the Compensation and Betterment Sub-Committee of the Lord presidents committee, but there are certain points on which I must seek the views of mycolleagues urgently so that further progress can be made with the preparationof the Bill during the recess.A. Compensation for the General Restriction. *2. One of the main effects of the Bill will be to take all rights of develop-ment out of private hands, thus restricting owners to their existing use of landunless they receive the consent of the planning authority to any change and payable betterment charge where appropriate. The Cabinet provisionally approvedcompensation for this step on a basis which gave &apos;(i) 100 per cent, compensation where land was &apos;&apos; dead-ripe &apos;&apos; for develop-ment;(ii) a refund on an &quot; out-of-pocket loss &quot; basis of any money actually paid for development value since 1929;(iii) 33^ per cent, in all other cases.3. The Cabinet withheld final approval to these proposals, however, pendingan estimate of the likely cost, and from such data as are available it was latercalculated that the total compensation bill might be of the order of  500-600 million or possibly more, t In view of the difficulties which the Chancellor of the Exchequerand others of my colleagues saw in the original scheme (particularly in justifying the flat percentage, which I had suggested ought to be reduced from 33^ per cent, to25 per cent.) I submitted to the Compensation and Betterment Sub-Committeeon the 24th June; an amended scheme to limit compensation to &quot;out-of-pocketloss &apos;&apos; that is to say, a land owner should have refunded to him any moneyactually spent on purchasing the land in excess of the value left to him after therestriction to existing use has been imposed. This seemed to me on reflection tobe the only case in which we should admit that land-owners had any right to compensation for being deprived for the future of increment in land valueresulting from development. The Compensation and Betterment Sub-committee approved this proposal and invited me to arrange for inter-departmental discus-sion of the details at official level, with a view to immediate redrafting of thecompensation clauses of the Bill, g* CM.

4. As the Bill as drafted already included clauses to give effect to the&quot;out-of-pocket loss&quot; formula, I did not anticipate any difficulty in adaptingthe existing draft so as to exclude compensation where no monetary loss hadbeen suffered; but in further discussion the Chief Valuer has properly drawn attention to a number of problems that might arise in applying the proposal to particular cases, and, although he does not, I understand, pronounce the schemequite impracticable, he is nevertheless of the opinion that oases will arise inwhich it could only be operated with extreme difficulty. I set out in Appendix Athe details of the compensation formula and indicate at which points thosedifficulties arise. I also suggest possible methods for overcoming some of thedifficulties, but even with these modifications the Chief Valuer is doubtful whetherthe proposals will be capable of proper application in all cases. Shortly, themain difficulty is in making an accurate apportionment where an owner hasdisposed of part of his land after building on it or otherwise improving its value for development.5. In view of the difficulties which had arisen, the Treasury representative at the official discussions suggested an alternative method of calculation (set outin Appendix B) which overcomes most of the problems of valuation. I thinkit right, therefore, to submit both proposals to my colleagues in order that wemay decide which we should adopt.6.   To sum up the position in a few words, the choice is between :  (a) A refund basis of compensation founded on the principle than an ownershould have refunded to him any money actually spent on the purchaseof the land in excess of the value left to him after the generalrestriction to existing use has been imposed; and(b) a discount basis of compensation that takes as its starting point thedifference between the market value unrestricted and the market value restricted and calculates the compensation payable by discount-ing that figure on a 5 per cent, basis back to the date of purchase.7. For my own part, I strongly recommend the refund proposal at (a),because it is based on a clear principle that will be more readily understood bythe House and the public generally and is, I believe, more likely to be acceptedby them as fair. The detailed suggestions in Appendix A are designed toreduce the valuation problems to a minimum and the main principle could beapplied without difficulty over by far the greater part of the field. I fully recognise that difficulties may arise in some cases and if they cannot be disposedof by a negotiated settlement there will have to be arbitration or even litiga-tion before those claims could be settled up; but this will be true of any scheme,however simple it may appear on the surface. In my view, therefore, we ought not lightly to depart from a scheme that is based on a sound and readily under-stood principle, unless an alternative can be found that is equally acceptable,both politically and financially.8. My main objection to the &quot; discount &quot; proposal put forward by theTreasury- representative is the difficulty of explaining why the discount shouldbe applied and of defending it. The formula takes as its starting point whatpurports to be the actual loss of value (although, in fact, the amounts soarrived at would be very heavily swollen because of the factor of &apos;&apos; floating-value &quot;) and then reduces the compensation without regard to what the actualmonetary loss is or, indeed, to whether there was any monetary loss at all.Nevertheless, the defence would have to be based primarily on the &quot; out-of-pocket loss &apos;&apos; principle, but with the added refinement that we are compensating,not on the basis of what an owner in fact paid, but on what we think he wouldhave paid had he been able at the time of purchase to forecast accurately thelevel of &quot; market &quot; value (including &quot; float &quot;) which a valuer would put on hisland at the present time. Apart from the difficulty of explaining and justify-ing this proposition, I believe it would give many owners far more than theirmonetary loss and other owners particularly those already hit by the war substantially less.9. Finally, although no firm estimate can be made, the total cost to theExchequer under the discount proposal may be considerably higher than underunder the refund proposal. This depends partly on what is taken to be a&quot; purchase &quot; for fixing the discount period a fruitful source for litigation inany event. I doubt if we could limit it to actual purchases for full monetaryconsideration; we should certainly be pressed to admit sales for partial con-sideration and, even sales for nominal consideration and, ultimately, gifts and
inheritance. On that basis, the total bill is bound to be very much higher than under the refund proposal which is based on actual, not hypothetical, loss.10. Assuming my colleagues agree that, politically, the straightforward&quot;refund&quot; proposal at (a) is preferable to the &quot;discount&quot; proposal at (b), thequestion for decision is whether the practical difficulties in the &quot; refund&quot; pro-posal are so formidable as to make it necessary to abandon it and adopt (5) or some other alternative. The main difficulty arises where the original purchasewas a long time ago and changes have since occurred (e.g., where part of the landoriginally purchased has since been sold off or where part of a lease has expiredor where improvements such as roads and sewers have been made and only partof the benefit has yet been reaped by development that has taken place). To alimited extent, the necessary apportionments in these cases might be reducedby Regulations to a mathematical formula, but it would still be necessary insome cases to ask the valuer to cast his mind back to a date in the past and provide data for the necessary calculations. The Chief Valuer properly draws attention to the fact that complete accuracy would not be possible in all cases,because the number of valuers with a knowledge of market conditions in thepast becomes more limited the further back we go; that a settlement wouldsometimes have to be reached purely as a matter of hard bargaining; and that,as the Arbitrator tends to lean to the subject, we should have to recognise that ameasure of overpayment might be necessary in these difficult cases in order toreach a settlement.11. I think we should try to ease the problem by drawing the backwardlimit at 1926 twenty years ago. This will reduce the number of difficult cases to a very limited range. I should not, notwithstanding the difficulties mentionedin the preceding paragraph, feel justified in recommending the abandonment of a scheme that has the merit of being simple, that can be easily defended andthat will produce the right result in most cases without any difficulty, in favourof an alternative that, in my view, offends all three of these criteria. I recommend,therefore, that we should adopt the &quot;refund &quot; scheme, set out in Appendix A.B. Application to Developed Land.12. At the suggestion of the Chancellor of the Exchequer I was invited by the Lord Presidents Committee* to consider further whether payment ofno compensation by which I assume a ,limitation of compensation to &quot;out-of-pocket loss&quot; was meant-could be defended in the case of developed land.In my view it would be quite illogical to treat developed land on a different basis from undeveloped land. The potential development values are in both cases the result of community influences and I can see no justifiable reason forsaying that owners of built-on land have a right to future increases in landvalue, and to a higher purchase price if their land is wanted to provide, say,open spaces or roads, while an owner of unbuilt-on land has not. Moreover, itwould not be easy to find a satisfactory definition of &quot; developed land.&quot; Theremay be some cases of owner-development where it will be expedient to be lenientin the matter of betterment, but that applies no less to undeveloped land and can be met in administration by an adjustment of the betterment charge.C. Finance and Central Purchase.13. At the meeting of the Lord Presidents Sub-Committee on the25th June at which proposals for the Central Purchase of land were considered.*I was asked to arrange for the examination, by officials of the Departments con-cerned, of-(a) a grants system that gave the necessary measure of financial assistanceto local planning authorities, but had regard to the finances of theAuthority concerned;(b) a central purchase system that achieved a similar result;I attach (Appendix C) a Report on these matters, prepared by my department in consultation with the Treasury, the Ministry of Health and the scottish office.   Part I of the Report sets out a scheme of grants which could be adopted* C.B. (46) 1st Meeting, para. 1.[32185] b 2
if it is decided not to centralise land purchase; Part II sets out an equivalentrenting basis which could be established under central purchase. Whicheverof the alternative bases is approved by my colleagues the details will need to be worked out in consultation with these Departments and with the other Depart-ments, particularly the Ministries of Transport, Health and Education, who areconcerned with land in reconstruction areas.14.   Briefly, the grants scheme is as follows : (a) The cost of acquiring and clearing land required for a reconstructionarea will be carried in a reconstruction account.(&amp;) All land will be transferred, after clearing, from the reconstructionaccount to the account of the local authority appropriate to the purpose for which it is to be used, at a price to be fixed on a basis whichis set out in paragraph 10 of Appendix C.(c) The reconstruction account will carry all capital costs not transferred toother accounts of the local authority.(d) Exchequer grant will be paid as a percentage of the annual loan charges on the capital cost so remaining in the reconstruction account.(e) The percentage might be, say, 50 per cent, of such charges for fiveyears, 40 per cent, for the next five years, and 30 per cent, for thenext fifty years. For the first ten years grant will be paid on ascer-tained relevant loan charges and thereafter on an estimate made atthe end of the tenth year.(/) Poor or heavily blitzed local authorities might receive extra grant upto, say, 20 per cent, over and above the standard percentages, on abasis to be settled.(g) The grants will be payable for areas of blitz or blight.15. My only doubt about this scheme is that I think the percentages are too low, because a maximum of 70 per cent, for five years, and 60 per cent,for the next five, may leave a Local Authority, particularly in a blitz scheme,with an undue burden during the early years. The 1944 Act grant for blitzprovides 100 per cent, of loan charges for the first two years of every borrowingand thereafter, during the next eight or, exceptionally, thirteen years, until such time as the related land has been brought into substantial use. It will be necessaryto secure that blitzed Authorities are not materially worse off under the newthan under the present scheme during the first ten years. The simplest methodmay be to provide special higher percentages for blitz during those years. Asto the basic or standard grant, the Treasury feel doubt whether a grant as high as 50 per cent, followed by 40 per cent, and 30 per cent, is not too much for the richer Authorities. To harmonise with the general policy of directingExchequer assistance where it is most needed, a lower starting point and a wider range for additions, would, in their view, be desirable.16. In the circumstances I would propose, if my colleagues agree to thegeneral principle, that, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland,I should settle with the Chancellor the general standard or basic percentages, theaddition for blight for poorer Authorities, and the special provision for blitz.17. The rent alternative under a scheme of central purchase is set out verybriefly in Part II of Appendix C. For reconstruction areas it produces thesame financial result as the grant scheme and has the additional advantage thatit avoids anomalies between the cost to local authorities of land in reconstruc-tion areas and other land. Accordingly, of the two methods of sharing theburden with local authorities I recommend it.D. Planning Authorities.18. I was also asked by the Compensation and Betterment Sub-Committee*to examine, in consultation with the Minister of Health, whether planning functions ought not to be taken out of the hands of the country districts andthe City of London, and placed with the County Councils and County borough councils. We have come to the conclusion that it would be unwise to make this change in the present Bill. Full arguments on the question are set outin Appendix D.* C.B. (46). 1st Meeting, para. 2, Conclusion (2).
E. Control of Outdoor Advertisements.19. The Compensation and Betterment Sub-Committee also invited me toconsider whether the control of outdoor advertisements could be included in theBill.* It will be possible to bring the erection of hoardings and the use ofland for advertisement purposes within the main control machinery of the bill and I propose to do so.F. Other Outstanding Questions.20.   There are two other major matters that will need examination, namely (a) the payment of betterment by local authorities in respect of land theypurchase in future for their statutory purposes;(b\ the extent of Exchequer contribution to the compensation payable forinterfering with existing buildings and uses that contravene planningrequirements.If my colleagues agree, I propose to discuss these points with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.L. S.Ministry of Town and Country Planning,24th July, 1946.* C.B. (46) 1st Meeting, para. 2, Conclusion (6).
APPENDIX A.The &quot; Out-of-Pocket Loss &quot; or &quot;Refund&quot; Basis of Compensation.1. General formula.The formula would provide that compensation should be the differencebetween (a) the price paid for the land (with a &apos;&apos; ceiling &apos;&apos; of present market value) and(b) the present value restricted to existing use.Claims below  20 should be excluded.2. Inherited land.It is suggested that inheritance should be disregarded. To treat it as apurchase at Probate Valuation would be at variance with the main concept ofrepaying actual monetary loss and would thus make the main scheme difficult tojustify. Instead, the owner should be allowed to stand in the shoes of the person from whom he inherited and calculate his compensation by reference to the price which his predecessor in title paid. Where an owner had himself paid deathduties in respect of a development value, it may be necessary to treat the dutiesso paid as an additional head of &quot; out-of-pocket loss.&quot; This, however, is a concession that could well be left for insertion during the passage of the bill through the House.3. Backward Limit.Development values do not normally attach to land more than some twenty years in advance of the demand for development, and to provide no backwardlimit would lead to valuation difficulties and demands that, for the purpose of the calculation, purchase prices should be adjusted to take account of changed moneyvalues, &amp;c. Moreover, it would extend the range of difficult cases wheresubstantial changes of character may have occurred but where the necessary datato check the claim would not be available. It is suggested, therefore, that noclaims should be entertained if the last purchase was prior to 1926.4. Mortgages.The question whether a mortgage should be treated as equivalent to apurchase has been further considered, and it is thought that it should not. Ingeneral, financial houses will not advance money on the security of a development value it is too speculative. They would normally require collateral security,unless they are satisfied that the personal covenant is adequate, and there would,therefore, be no hardship or cash loss.5. Change in unit.Where part of the land originally purchased has been disposed of it willbe necessary to find a method of settling how much of the purchase price was attributable to the unit of land left. The Bill as drafted (which imposed abackward limit to 1929 for &apos;&apos; out-of-pocket loss &apos;&apos; claims) left it to be done bya valuation process, with resort to the official arbitrator in default of agreement;but the Chief Valuer advises that this would be difficult, as a matter of valuation,as far back as 1926.It is suggested, therefore, that the calculation might be reduced to amathematical formula, by taking the price realised on the sale, discounting it backto the date of purchase and deducting that amount from the original purchase price.  Thus  100 acres purchased in 1926 for    .........      20,00040 acres sold in 1936 for  15,000-  Discounted for 10 years =  9,000      ...  9,000Add rents received 1926-36 for existing use* =  600 ............     600--9,60060 acres left: notional purchase price    ...      ...      10,400This would not do violence to the main principle and would, on the whole,be fair because it gives full weight to actual happenings.* This calculation could most conveniently be based on the Schedule A assessment for income Tax purposes.
The main difficulty that arises is where the land disposed of had been improved before sale e.g., by the building of houses, or the laying of roads and sewers. In such cases it would be necessary to estimate how much of the amountrealised on the sales was attributable to the improvements, and the Chief Valuerrightly points out that this will not be an easy task. On the other hand, casesof this sort will not be numerous and in many of them it will be desirable to grantplanning permission to round off the building development already started, free of compensation and betterment. The rest would have to be left to a negotiated settlement or, if necessary, arbitration.6. Running out of leases.A similar problem arises where a lease has partly run out and the initialpurchase price has to be adjusted to the term now remaining. Again, however,the number of cases where a lessee&apos;s interest is reduced by the general restrictionwill be relatively few, and a general formula enabling the Land commissioner the Arbitrator to make any necessary adjustment should be sufficient for practical purposes.7. Deterioration.Cases will similarly arise where values have dropped because of deterioration in the condition of buildings, changes of fashion, fluctuation of demand, demolition-tions, &amp;c. In these cases the &quot;ceiling&quot; of present values will prevent theowner getting more than 100 per cent, compensation, and that, together with thebackward limit will be sufficient safeguard. Special provision will, of course,have to be made for cases of war-damage, destruction by fire or other accident,and demolition with the intention of immediate rebuilding.8. Improvements.Where improvements made since the purchase have operated to increasethe present &quot; existing use &quot; value of land, the effect will be to reduce the amountof compensation; and as the owner would have to sacrifice those improvements to reap his development value, this would not be inequitable.Where improvements have been made in anticipation of development, theywill not normally increase the &apos;&apos; existing use &apos;&apos; value. Special provision shouldbe made on the lines of existing law for paying additional compensation wherework of this kind is rendered abortive by a future refusal of permission tocomplete the development, provided the work was not carried out in defiance ofa planning refusal.Notes :(1) The objections to the proposal, on grounds of practicability, thuscentre round the valuation difficulties in making the necessary adjustments where since the last purchase the owner has soldoff part of the land in an improved state; and in adjusting thepurchase price where part of a lease has expired.(2) As to the cost of this scheme, further investigation suggests thatthe figures of  80 to  100 million previously given* is likely tobe too low. There are no data on which to base anything but avery rough guess and there is wide difference of opinion on thequestion of the amount of floatt in the selling price of land.It seems to be reasonably certain, however, that as compared withthe earlier scheme there would be a saving of the order of  300million and it may well be more : in other words according tothe view that is taken on float the cost of the earlier scheme would be anything between  500 and  750 million and that ofthe new scheme anything between  200 and  450 million. Thelower figure is probably nearer the mark, particularly with alimiting date of 1926.* O.B. (46) 4, para. 7.f Buyers of land at a price which reflects the chance of profit from future development,whether developers, investors or pure speculators, do not, as a class, lose money on the trans-actions, although there are, no doubt, cases of bad bargains. The fact that particular land hascome into the market and has been bought by such persons often accelerates the developmentof that land, particularly if other land suitable for development is kept out of the market; thethe purchaser then gets a quick and remunerative return on his outlay. On the other hand,land is sometimes bought at a development value without any intention of developing, e.g., it maybe bought for amenity purposes or sports grounds or because the purchaser prefers to continuethe existing use and has no desire to reap the higher return that could be secured by developing.Other land will then command a higher value because the demand for land for development isunaffected. The total prices paid will thus include some duplication of development value.There are no data available, however, on which to estimate the extent of this duplication.
The &quot; Discount &quot; Basis of Compensation.1. General Formula.The proposal is that there should be ascertained on a valuation basis, inrespect of any interest in land for which a claim is submitted (a) the current market value of the interest unrestricted;(b) the current market value restricted to existing use.The amount so arrived at would then be discounted back, on a 5 per cent,basis, to the date on which the interest was last purchased in order to arrive at theamount of compensation payable. Claims based on a difference of less than  20would be excluded.2. Definition of Purchase.A definition of purchase would be required for this scheme, to settle the dis-count period. Purchase would include any transaction for full consideration in money or money&apos;s worth, including exchanges, but would exclude gifts, trans-actions in consideration of marriage or natural love and affection and transactionsfor&quot; nominal or partial considerations. Where the purchase had been effected bymore than one transaction e.g., the purchase of a freehold reversion followed ata later date by the purchase of a lease; or the purchase of land subject to an ease-ment or a restrictive covenant or possibly a mortgage followed by the buying outof the additional right, it would be necessary to find the total value in money ormoney&apos;s worth of the various transactions at a date when they occurred, adjusteach notionally, so that in total they add up to the present development value, andthen discount each so notionally adjusted back to the date of the transaction.3. Improvements.Where the unrestricted value included a value for improvements made in anticipation of development, e.g., roads and sewer,&amp; and carried out by the ownersince he purchased, the value would have to be calculated without regard to thoseimprovements and separate provision made for additional compensation at the full rate if work was rendered abortive by a refusal of planning consent.4. Ceiling.There could be no ceiling by reference to price actually paid without import-ing the same difficulties as under the refund basis. The initial calculation&apos; by reference to current values would provide a ceiling of 100 per cent, compensation(including &quot; float &quot;).5. Inheritance.Similar provisions would be made as under the &quot; refund &quot; basis see para-graph 2 of Appendix A.6. Backward Limit.A backward limit of 20 years would be imposed.Notes:(1) No problems arise under this scheme in regard to changes of unitor deterioration and apart from difficulties regarding improve-ments, all valuation work is based on current values.(2) It would presumably be necessary to fix the discount period by reference to the last transaction for full monetary considera-tion. In some cases, therefore, the Valuation Office and the Arbitrator would have to be asked to decide whether or not a transaction was for full consideration.(3) As a very rough guess, the cost is likely to be in the region of  450to  500 million. Because the initial valuations will include the element of &quot; floating value &quot; the average owner may receive incompensation substantially more than his actual &quot;out-of-pocketloss.&quot; Whether or not this scheme is more costly than thealternative will depend on which view as to the float in purchaseprices proves to be correct. If such prices include the averageamount of float there would be little to choose, but if, in fact,purchase prices normally contain little float, this scheme wouldbe more costly than the refund scheme.
Part I. Revised Grants Scheme under the Town and country planning Acts.1. Whilst the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1944,relate to the development of areas of extensive war damage (i.e., blitz) and areasof bad lay-out and obsolete development (i.e., blight), the grant provisions applyto blitz areas only. The revised grants scheme outlined in this memorandum is applicable to the redevelopment of blitz and blight areas.A $sumptions.2.   The following assumptions are made : (a) Local authorities concerned would submit applications to the Ministerto designate areas of extensive war damage under Section 1 of the1944 Act or of comprehensive redevelopment under Sections 9 or 10or under the Bill, and would also submit a broad estimate of the total capital expenditure and a statement showing a comparison betweenthe estimated cost and return.(b) Only such land and property would be included as is necessary for thepurpose of obtaining a fresh and sound lay-out, .and schemes whichcould be carried out. satisfactorily under other statutes would notbe approved.(c) If the redevelopment of a designated area is expected to take more than five years to complete, a local authority would be asked to submit tothe Minister separate compulsory purchase orders, each covering sucha part of the designated area as could be redeveloped within a periodof, say, five to seven years.(d) The purchase of land would remain in the hands of local authorities.(e) Local authorities would normally obtain loans from the Public works loans Commissioners, repayable over a period of sixty years.&quot; Clearing.&quot; ,3. In Section 65 of the 1944 Act, &quot;clearing&quot; is defined as preparing the land to the prescribed extent for development, including the constructionof any prescribed works in the course of so preparing it. This has hitherto been regarded as including the cost of preparing the site to the point when itis available for building and would include the cost of constructing estate roads and sewers. In future, all constructional work would be excluded from thereconstruction capital account and &quot;clearing&quot; would be defined as meaningin general the removal of debris or the filling up of holes.Revised grants sdheme.4. (a) All capital expenditure incurred by a local authority in respect ofthe acquisition of land, compensation for disturbance and compensation to statutory undertakers, together with the cost of clearing the land as defined inparagraph 3 above, would in the first place be charged to the reconstructioncapital account. All land would be appropriated or transferred to other services or accounts of the local authority at the time and valuation to be determined on the lines indicated in paragraphs 8 and 10, leaving the capital loss on recon-struction in the reconstruction capital account.Land with standing property would be transferred forthwith out of thereconstruction capital account, and would be brought back into that account as and when it was required for demolition as part of the scheme of redevelopment.Transfers would also be made out of reconstruction capital account of land tobe developed for private enterprise building or for private development ;dngeneral, e.g., industrial or commercial purposes.(b) Exchequer grant would be payable during the first ten years of redevelop-ment equivalent to a percentage of the annual loan charges on capital expendi-ture remaining in the reconstruction capital account. The scale of grant wouldprovide for two stages during that period, viz., the first five years covering themain redevelopment period and the second five years being a period when thereturn from redevelopment would be steadily increasing.From the eleventh year onwards, the Exchequer grant would be based onthe estimated capital loss resulting from the completed redevelopment.   A state-ment would be obtained from the local authority showing for each C.P.O. area[32185] c
the total capital expenditure, the total amount transferred (or still to be trans-ferred) to other services or accounts (see also paragraph 10 (/) of this Appendix)and the actual or estimated return resulting from the redevelopment. Fromthat statement the estimated capital loss would be ascertained and grant wouldbe payable on the basis of the loan charges related to the capital loss for theremainder of the 60 years period, subject to the review mentioned in paragraph 10below.(c) Grant would be payable on the basis of a percentage of the annual loan charges related to the capital expenditure or cajoital loss, ascertained on the lines indicated in sub-paragraph (b) above. The standard scale of percentage grantsapplicable to each compulsory purchase area might be as follows : In order to meet the needs of a poor local authority or of a local authority which had suffered severely from war damage, and the burden on the local rates would be unduly heavy, the Minister would have discretion to increase thestandard percentages up to maxima of, say, 70, 60 and 50 respectively on a basisto be agreed with the Treasury.Under the 1944 Act, a grant equivalent to 100 per cent, of the loan chargesis payable for the first two years after each borrowing in respect of the redevelopment of blitz areas. When the revised scheme is discussed with thelocal authority associations, it may be found necessary to agree, in the case ofblitz areas only, to the payment of grant on a scale which will give to localauthorities during the first ten years the broad equivalent of what they might expect to get under the 1944 Act.(d) The payment of grants would be conditional upon the Minister being satisfied that the local authority was carrying out the scheme of redevelopment ina reasonably expeditious and efficient manner, and that the disposal of land was effected on lines approved by the Minister.Land A cquired as Overspill.5. Expenditure incurred in the acquisition and clearing of land in an over-spill area would be charged to the reconstruction capital account, and grant wouldbe payable on the same basis as that shown in paragraph 4 as applicable to areconstruction area, until the land was transferred out of the reconstructioncapital account.Roads.6. (a) Capital expenditure incurred in respect of the acquisition of land required for roads in reconstruction or overspill areas would attract grant under the system outlined in paragraph 4, until suchland is appropriated to the highways account under the terms ofparagraph 10.(&amp;) The only contribution made by a local planning authority to a localhighway authority which would attract grant under the revisedgrants scheme is that relating to expenditure incurred by a localhighway authority in the acquisition and clearing of land outside areconstruction or overspill area, either for the purpose of securing asatisfactory lay-out in the reconstruction area or for the purpose ofproviding proper means of access to the land in an overspill area.(c) In a major scheme of road construction or improvement in which planning considerations are subordinate to highway requirements,it may be advisable, as an alternative, to provide that the highway authority should bear all the relevant costs, including the cost ofland incorporated in the highway, which it would normally have borne if the road scheme had been carried out entirely under high-way powers, account being taken of any financial advantage the highway authority could reasonably have obtained by applying theprovisions of Section 83 of the Public Health Act, 1925 (which provides that a local authority may purchase premises for theimprovement and development of frontages to any street). such expenditure would be excluded from the grants scheme outlined inthis memorandum but would be eligible for the appropriate grants from the Road Fund.Years.Per cent.1 to   56 to 1011 to 60504030
Repeal of 1944 Act Grants Scheme.7. The scheme of grants payable on the lines set out in paragraphs 4 to 6would replace the scheme of grants payable under Sections 5 and 6 (3) of the 1944Act. It is also proposed that Section 8 of that Act, relating to a Quinquennialreview of the financial effect of redevelopment, should be repealed and that the definition of &apos;&apos; clearing &apos;&apos; in Section 65 should be amended.Temporary Shops and Buildings.8. Owing to the impossibility of constructing permanent buildings on a large scale at present, it is probable that temporary shops or buildings will be con-structed. The ground rent or rents receivable would generally be lower thanthose obtainable when permanent premises are constructed. The land would betransferred out of the reconstruction capital account before the temporary shops and buildings are erected, but the valuations would have regard to the rentsestimated to be received during a period of about ten years, subject to thepossibility of a review as explained in paragraph 10 (/).Public Open Spaces.9. The cost of acquiring land for public open spaces in the designated oroverspill areas would be included in the cost of redevelopment and would attractgrant on the terms indicated in paragraph 4, until transferred out of the recon-struction capital account on the basis proposed in paragraph 10.Appropriation out of Reconstruction Capital Account.10. (a) Local authorities will appropriate or transfer land out of the recon-struction capital account to any other service or account for which the land isrequired.(b) The date of appropriation out to other local authority services or accountswould be the date on which any constructional work is commenced, or five years from the date of purchase, whichever is the earlier.(c) The value at which land would be appropriated out would be that certi-fied by the District Valuer on the following basis : (i) Housing or educational purposes at the value of the  land forresidential purposes,(ii) Highways the excess, if any, of  the acreage of roads  followingredevelopment over the pre-redevelopment acreage at the average costof the land for the C.P.O. area.(iii) Public open spaces at one quarter of the &quot;value of land for residentalpurposes.(iv) Municipal offices at the value of land for a comparable commercial use.(v) Public buildings, e.g., library, museum at the value of land for pre-vailing use in the neighbourhood,(vi) Land with standing property at the actual cost.(vii) Land for private enterprise, building or private development in general,e.g., for industrial and commercial purposes at the value of land forthat use.(viii) Land for statutory undertakers at the value of land for industrial or commercial use in the locality.(d) When standing property is to be demolished, the land would be trans-ferred back into the reconstruction capital account at the value at which it was previously transferred out of that account and would attract grant from theappropriate point in the scale of grants, i.e., if brought back into the reconstruc-tion capital account in the fourth year it would attract grant on the percentagesappropriate to that year and succeeding years. After clearing, the land would again be transferred out of the reconstruction capital account at a value to bedetermined on the lines of sub-paragraph (c) above.(e) The expenditure remaining in the reconstruction capital account at anytime will be the total capital cost of land not appropriated or transferred to other local authority services or accounts, plus the balance of cost of land appropriatedout to local authority services or accounts (i.e., where the total cost of such landis greater than the value at which the land was appropriated out). The capital cost would include compensation for disturbance and compensation paid to statutory undertakers.[32185] c 2
(/) The valuation at which land is appropriated or transferred to other local authority services, viz., those covered by items (i) to (v) and (viii) of sub-paragraph (c) above will be final. The valuation of land transferred out of thereconstruction capital account for industrial and commercial purposes (item vii)must of necessity be made on a provisional basis in many cases, as it will not bepossible to make a reliable estimate of the rents to be received. It is, therefore,proposed that these valuations should be reviewed at a elate in the tenth year when a more reliable valuation will be possible. It is not proposed that there shouldbe any retrospective adjustment of grant paid on the provisional basis, but grant payable subsequently would be adjusted in accordance with the revised valuations.Item (vi) is covered by sub-paragraph (d) above.Appropriations into the Reconstruction Capital Account.11. Land and property belonging to a local authority would be appropriatedinto the reconstruction capital account only when it was actually required forredevelopment. The appropriation would be at the 1939 value until such time as the 1939 standard may be abandoned.Compensation and Betterment.12. Local authorities will henceforward purchase at existing use value and,where compensation for the general restriction has been attracted, it will havebeen paid or credited to the previous owner. The basis of appropriations out is designed to include any betterment which might otherwise be payable, since itis related, directly or indirectly, to future use. There may be a case, however,for levying the equivalent of a betterment charge upon the local authority if, atthe end of the tenth year, when the question of a grant for the remainder of theloan period is settled, an examination of the position showed that there was nodeficit on the reconstruction capital account (and therefore no need for furthergrant), but, instead, a surplus. In such a case, the local authority might berequired to pay to the Exchequer an annual payment for 50 years of a sum equalto, say, 30 per cent, of the estimated surplus, or such higher percentage notexceeding 50 per cent, determined on a formula to which reference is made inparagraph 4 (c). It is, however, open to doubt whether such a complication isworth while, since surpluses will be very rare.Part II. -Rental System under Central Purchase.Reconstruction A reas.13. The scheme of grants set out above could be readily adapted for a schemeof rents in reconstruction areas if land purchase is centralised.14. The basis of rents set out in Appendix I of the Third Report of theOfficial Sub-Committee* needs to be amended only in respect of item 5 (municipalhousing and schools), where, for the basis suggested in the Appendix, there shouldbe substituted the value of the land for residential purposes, as in paragraph 10 (c)above.15. For each compulsory purchase area in a reconstruction area there wouldbe one lease to the local authority and one global rent would be charged calculated as follows : (a) A notional &apos;&apos; economic rent&apos;&apos; would be fixed, based upon the Land Corn-mission^ relative loan charges and apportioned administrative expenses.(6) Land instead of being appropriated out by the local authority would besub-leased at rents fixed as in paragraph 14.(c) The aggregate of the sub-lease rents would be compared with the notionalrent at (a) above and any notional&apos; deficiency ascertained.id) From the deficiency there would be subtracted the percentage appro-priate to the year and to the authority as in paragraph 4 (c), and the resulting sum would be added to the aggregate rents at (c) above.(e) The final figure so obtained would be the rent chargeable to the localauthority.   It would be subject to the same reviews as under a systemof grants and the financial balance between the local authority and theExchequer would be the same.* C.B. (46) 2.
16. Betterment might be charged as in paragraph 12 if it is thought tobe worth wlhilei an any ease where at the end of the tenth year the aggregaterents at 15 (c) exceeded the notional rent at 15 (a).Other A reas.17. Where a local authority needs land for any of the purposes set out inAppendix I of C.B. (O) (46) 13 in an area other than a reconstruction area, the rents basis given in paragraphs 1 to 8 of that Appendix would apply. If it isconsidered necessary to differentiate between poor and wealthy authorities andthe rent so calculated falls short of the notional rent for the land calculated as inparagraph 15 (a) above, it would be a simple matter to make a percentage additionfrom the first year, calculated in the same way as in paragraph 15 (d).18. It is to be noted that, if this is done, local authorities will receive ameasure of assistance which they will not get under a grant aid system as inPart I without central purchase. The alternative would be to charge a rentfixed by reference to cost of purchase, plus an addition, where appropriate forbetterment. But it can be argued that this is one of the advantages of centralpurchase since it does not distort good planning by discouraging authorities fromredeveloping dear land. It would be possible, if in general this is too favourable to local authorities, to counteract it by some adjustment of the percentages inparagraph 4 (c) since practically every local authority will in future have oneor more schemes to which those percentages will apply. It may be added thatthis arrangement avoids a difficulty which is inevitable under a grant schemeconfined to reconstruction areas, viz.. that local authorities may, in effect, bepaying different prices for similar land acquired for similar purposes accordingto whether on not the land has been bought as part of a reconstruction area.APPENDIX D.Planning Authorities.1. The Minister of Town and Country Planning and the Minister of Healthwere asked by the Compensation and Betterment Sub-Committee* &quot; to examine whether the councils of county districts and the Common Council of the City ofLondon should not be deprived of their planning functions and those transferredto the County Council.&quot;2. The Local Authorities for the preparation of planning schemes are inLondon, the Common Council of the City of London and the London CountyCouncil, and elsewhere the councils of county boroughs and county districts. InTact, however, planning schemes are in most cases being prepared by joint plan-ning committees set up under provisions of the Planning Acts either by voluntarycombination of the Local Authorities or by order of the Minister of Town and country Planning. These same Authorities are &apos;&apos; the local planning authority &apos;&apos;for the purposes of blitz and blight redevelopment schemes under the 1944 Act,and Joint Committees may be set up for the &quot; designation &quot; of blitzed areas forredevelopment, but not for carrying out the redevelopment.3. Although, however, by means of joint planning committees planning iscarried out over wide areas, there, are 1,441 Planning Authorities retainingindependent powers. The number of Authorities who do not form their ownvoluntary combinations is large, and the task for the Ministry of Town and country Planning in securing efiective combinations is heavy; and even whenthe combination has been secured it is within the power of any constituent LocalAuthority to withdraw from the committee. From, this point of view there wouldbe a manifest and substantial advantage to the Minister of Town and country planning in having a much smaller number of Authorities to deal with. Moreover,if the county council were the Planning Authority and progress in planning was insufficient, the blame would rest unequivocably on the county council. If a jointcommittee makes insufficient progress it may be. extremely difficult to determineas between the constituent members where the blame lies. Further, if the countycouncil were the Planning Authority, and accordingly appointed all planning staff within the county, a saving in the total number of technical staff requiredmight be expected and probably an overall improvement in the quality of the* C.B. (46) 1st Meeting, para. 2, conclusion (2).
technical service since the staff could be pooled for the whole county.. At present,in general, each joint committee has a separate technical staff. In some cases,even within the present system, the county council do in fact provide all the staff for joint committees, but this arrangement is not universal.4. On the other hand the immediate effect of a transfer of the planning functions of the county district councils to county councils would be to disruptthe existing joint planning committees, many of whom have made substantial progress with the planning of their areas, and to divorce the planning of countyareas from county borough areas.5. Further, it is to be remembered : (1) that the planning functions of county district councils are not limited to the actual preparation of planning schemes,but extend to the control of development to secure conformity with the provisionsor proposed provisions of a scheme. The latter function is of concern to a vastnumber of private developers who would find great difficulty in dealing with a body at a remote centre, as would often be the case if the responsibility for controlof development rested with the county council. It would accordingly in any case be impracticable to transfer these latter functions to the county councils; (2) that although county councils are not primarily planning authorities, they have, andhave had since 1929, very substantial powers in regard to planning. As already indicated, they may be, and invariably are, constituent members of joint planningcommittees; county district councils may relinquish their powers of preparingschemes to county councils, and have in some cases done so; and the county councils are responsible for the execution of schemes in matters in which the generalstatutory responsibility is with them, e.g., highways. The county councils have infact come to play a predominant part in planning. At the outbreak of war, in30 out of 62 counties the main direction of planning work was in the hands ofthe county council, and that number has since increased to 37. In a few countiesplanning powers have been relinquished to the county council, but it is noteworthythat where at initial conferences the two alternatives, joint committees orrelinquishment, have been discussed, few county councils have pressed forrelinquishment.6. Two points are of particular importance in considering the question of authorities for the preparation of planning schemes : (1) Planning is intimately concerned with some matters which are the function of county borough or county district councils, and not ofcounty councils, e.g., housing, sewering, water supply. It is accordingly essential that the county district councils should have an effective part in the preparation of planning schemes.(2) The transfer of the planning powers of county district councils to thecounty councils, while it would automatically secure that planningwas carried out over wide areas, would not in itself secure, as isnecessary, and as the present system of joint planning committeessecures in most cases, that the planning of county borough areas iscarried out integrally with the planning of county areas. Some stressmay, moreover, be laid on the consideration that the participation ofthe smaller authorities in planning affords a valuable field for thedevelopment of local government experience.7. The Minister of Town and Country Planning has substantial powers ofcontrol over county district councils as planning authorities. As already mentioned he can secure that they become members of joint planning committees;he can himself prepare a scheme in default of the Authority, or in the case of rural districts of the smaller urban district councils, can transfer their powers tothe county council. As regards the control of development, he can direct the reference of applications or particular classes of applications to himself for decision; he can revoke decisions given by the interim&apos;development authority;and, if necessary, he can transfer their powers of control of interim developmenteither to a joint planning committee or to the county council.8. The Minister&apos;s powers of control would be strengthened by the proposedprovisions of the Town and Country Planning (Development Rights) Bill: (1) It is proposed to empower the Minister, after due consultation with theAuthority concerned, to transfer any of the functions of the county district council under the Bill (including the duty of preparing outline,plans) to the county council.
(2) It is proposed, as regards the control of development, to empower theMinister to give directions restricting the grant of permission by thedevelopment authority.9. A county council cannot be authorised to undertake a redevelopmentscheme for a blitz or blight area under the 1944 Act. The question of trans-ferring these duties was not, however, in mind and the matter is not dealt within detail in this memorandum. It will probably be agreed that, in general, therewould be great difficulties in the way of the county council carrying out redevelop-ment schemes in the area of a large borough or urban district. It is proposed,however, that there should be power to transfer redevelopment powers to thecounty council in those few exceptional cases in which this course may be found desirable.10. So far as the present position is unsatisfactory it is so because in somecases the joint planning committees which have been set up are inactive. It doesnot, however, follow that in such cases which are the exception and not the rule the trouble would be cured by the transfer of the planning powers to thecounty council. It is probable that where this trouble arises it is largely dueto a lack of appreciation of the need for planning on the part of the countycouncil no less than of the minor authorities. A remedy can be found in theeducation of the authorities concerned to a sense of their responsibilities, and this process will be much assisted by the greater opportunities of obtaining qualifiedtechnical staff which should soon present themselves. But in any event this very limited difficulty is an altogether insufficient reason for a general transfer ofpowers to county councils. It is proposed, however, to take power to transferplanning functions from a joint planning committee to the county council in anycase in which the joint committee is not working satisfactorily and the Ministerof Town and Country Planning is satisfied that the county council would do better. The mere existence of such a power in the background would, it isthought, provide a spur to lethargic joint committees.11. To summarise, it is a question of balancing the substantial advantageon the one hand, in concentrating the responsibility for planning in the handsof many fewer Authorities against, on the other hand, the disadvantage in theslowing down of planning which would be the immediate and inescapable resultof the transfer of powers to the county councils and the separation of the planning of county and county boroughs whicli would be likely to be the permanent result.It is thought that the balance of advantage is against any general redistribution of planning functions and that, so far as the object is to obviate inefficiency in planning, an adequate remedy is to be found in strengthening the powers ofcontrol of the Minister of Town and Country Planning on the lines proposedin this Appendix.12. The Ministry of Health are in general agreement with the views expressed in this Appendix.24^ July, 1946.
