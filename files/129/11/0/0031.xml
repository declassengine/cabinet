(46) 281.20th July, 1946.CABINET.PALESTINE.Note, by the Additional Secretary.BY the Prime Minister&apos;s direction I circulate the following minute whichI have submitted to him on a point which has arisen in the course of the Anglo-American conversations on Palestine.(Signed) NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,20th July, 1946.Prime Minister.At their meeting on the 11th July the Cabinet approved the scheme for provincial autonomy in Palestine described in CP. (46) 259, and authorised meto put it forward in the discussions with the United States Delegation, subjectto any comments which might be received from the Chiefs of Staff.The Chiefs of Staff later reported to you that, from the military point ofview, any solution of the Palestine problem must satisfy two conditions. First,it must give us the power to control and co-ordinate the defence of the countryand to maintain forces and military facilities in it as, when and where we require;and, secondly, it must not alienate the Arab States. The Chiefs of Staff addedthat, while this was primarily a political matter and much would depend on the presentation, they were doubtful whether the scheme described in CP. (46) 259satisfied the second condition.2. With your authority I have put the scheme forward in the discussions,and the United States Delegation are disposed to accept it as a means of givingpractical effect to the general principles laid down in Recommendation 3 of theAnglo-American Committee. Discussion has turned primarily on the boundariesbetween the two Provinces. The Americans put forward proposals designed to expand the Jewish Province, while we have been seeking to enlarge the ArabProvince in order to meet the desire of the Chiefs of Staff that the scheme shouldbe made palatable to the Arabs.3. We have now succeeded in persuading the Americans to withdraw their proposals for the expansion of the Jewish Province, and the difference between us has been narrowed down to the delineation of the southern boundary of theJewish Province below Jaffa.
4. There are three possible choices, all of which are shown on the attachedmap : (a) Line A. This would add to the Arab Province a further 30,000 arabs and 2,700 Jews; 18,000 dunums* of Arab-owned and 6,000 dunumsof Jewish-owned citrus; and 270,000 dunums of Arab land and50,000 dunums of Jewish land. It would also give the Arabs directphysical access to Jaffa, the largest Arab town. This is the line whichwe have been advocating, as the most favourable to the Arabs.(b) Line B. This has not yet been discussed with the Americans.   It wouldnot have the economic advantages of Line A, but would give the Arabsdirect physical access to Jaffa and might, therefore, make the schememore palatable to them. On the other hand, it would divide the Jewishprovince in two.(c) Line C. This is the line originally proposed in the scheme described in CP. (46) 259; and it is the one favoured by the United states delegation.5. The British Delegation believe that a strong case can be made for Line A.It can be argued that, while the balance of political advantage and disadvantage in the scheme of provincial autonomy is about equal for both Arabs and Jews,its economic advantages are somewhat heavily weighted in favour of the Jews.We can therefore argue that the balance should be adjusted in favour of theArabs.6. Subject to your instructions, I would propose to talk privately to the leader of the United States Delegation, explain that we attach great importanceto Line A, and endeavour to secure his agreement to : (a) Line A; or(b) Failing that, Line B.Before I do so, however, I should be glad to know whether, if it becomes clearthat the United States Delegation will decline to accept either Line A or Line B,I have authority, in the last resort, to accept Line C(Signed)      NORMAN BROOK.20th July, 1946.* A dunum is about the equivalent of J acre.
