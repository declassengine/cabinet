Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 291.22nd July, 1946.CABINET.SUPPLIES OF  SOFTWOOD.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.I feel I should bring to the notice of my colleagues the present position ofour supplies of softwood, particularly in view of their effect on the housing programme. The Minister of Health has already circulated a memorandum onTimber for Housing (OP. (46) 277).2. The prospects of obtaining sufficient softwood to cover the housing programme were considered at the instance of the Housing Departments early inMay, and an informal Meeting of Housing Ministers was informed 1(a) that the allocations then proposed of 170,000 standards of softwood for building in the third and fourth quarters respectively would besufficient to cover the housing programme;(b) that the estimates of supply which had been given to the MaterialsCommittee were prudent and that supplies to meet the buildingallocations were reasonably secure; but(c) that, in view of the time required for preparing and implementingalterations in the designs of houses, it would be prudent for theMinistry of Health to prepare revised designs to effect further economies in the use of softwood, in case the need should arise.3. These conclusions were arrived at on the assumption that allocations forall purposes in the third and fourth quarter of 325,000 standards and 335,000standards respectively (including in each case 170,000 for building), would besufficient and could be met from estimated imports, home production and running down of stocks.4. Since that date there has been considerable deterioration largely owing to(a) the situation in British Columbia, where the delays due first to new pricedemands and then to a strike of timber operators which started in mid-Mayand has only just been settled cost us neariy 90,000 standards; and (b) the output in Germany falling well below estimates. As a result, allocations by the MaterialsCommittee for the third quarter of this year were only 300,000 standards(including 170,000 for building).5. In view of the fact that imports in the early months of the year are normally low owing to the closing by ice of shipping ports in Scandinavia and eastern Canada, it is important to consider the supply position between now and the end of June 1947 as a whole. The table in the Annex to this memorandumshows the estimated imports which can be considered firm in the third and fourthquarters of 1946 and in the first half of 1947. An indication has also been given of certain additional possibilities in the second half of 1946. It is as yet too early to venture any forecast of additional possibilities in the first half of 1947.6. It will be seen that imports over the twelve months which can at present be considerd firm amount to 811,000 standards to which must be added 70,000standards from home production, giving a total of 881,000.[32179]
7. The additional possibilities amount to 120,000 standards over the last half of 1946. Not all of these will be realised; and as, owing to seasonalconditions, any additional possibilities in early 1947 are bound to be less, it wouldbe unsafe to rely on more than 100,000 standards overall during 1946-47. this includes any substantial increase in German production, but any imports fromRussia would be an additional windfall.8. Stocks in the United Kingdom on the 1st July, 1946, were approximately305,000 standards, and in order to keep an efficient distribution system going theyshould not be below 250,000 standards at the end of June 1947.9. The following table sets out the resultant position over the twelvemonths : Standards.Stocks 1st July, 1946...............      305,000Imports (firm) ...      .,,      ......      ...      811,000Additional possibilities       ...      ...      ...      ...      100,000Home Production     ................ 70,000Deduct Allocations 3rd quarter, 1946 ... 300,000Required Stocks, 30th June, 1947        250,0001,286,000550,000736,000This must be spread over the three quarters October 1946-June 1947 andamounts to roughly 245,000 standards a quarter.10. Amounts of this order are, of course, considerably below Departmentalestimates of requirements. These were 344,000 standards for July-September1946 (as against an allocation of 300,000), and are estimated at 366,000 standardsfor October-December 1946; including in both cases 170,000 for building. Theallocation of 300,000 standards in July-September 1946 included 170,000standards for building. It is doubtful if this latter allocation could be maintained on an overall allocation of 245,000 standards as only 75,000 standards would beleft for non-building requirements against present estimated requirements of196,000, including 36,600 standards for export packing.11.   It is clear that in order to meet the deficit we must (a) exercise the utmost economy in our use of timber; and(&amp;) make every effort to increase our supplies not only from the areas we arenow tapping but from other areas particularly Russia,12. The Materials Committee have been asked to reconstitute the EconomySub-Committee to examine, in consultation with Departments and with industry,ways in which.softwoods can be saved and alternative materials utilised.13.   As regards the main sources of our supplies :(a) Russia has hitherto been unwilling to supply us with any timber.Recently, however, I raised the question with the Soviet Trade Corn-mission during the discussions on the price which they are preparedto pay for the equipment made to their order now held in this country.Negotiations are proceeding and I hope to report to my colleaguesorally on their outcome by the time this memorandum is considered.Over two months of the Russian shipping season has however alreadypassed, and unless timber is shipped by October it cannot arrive inthis country until June next. This will limit the amount that canbe taken, though I am pressing the Russians to transfer to us someof the timber which they are taking from Finland.(b) Germany. The earlier estimates have proved too sanguine.  Apart fromthe inevitable teething troubles of a new organisation, shortage offood has meant a smaller production than estimated. Arrange-ments have been made for an early discussion with the Control Officeand the North German Timber Control in order to see what stepscan be taken materially to increase the output. The advantage ifthis source is that shipment can continue throughout the winter.
(c) Scandinavia. Shortage of appropriate exports, particularly coal, hasrestricted the amounts of timber which Sweden and Finland willsell to us. Extra quantities are likely to be forthcoming from Finlandif we can supply certain amounts of bulb iron for shipbuilding andof electrical sheets.   This is being examined as a matter of urgency.(d) Canada is already supplying us with 35 per cent, of her output andit is unlikely that the Canadian Government would agree to any increase in this amount.14. Until the Russian and German problems are clearer, it is not possibleto assess the probable gap between supplies and requirements over the year.I hope to bring a further report to my colleagues at a later stage; but meanwhileI must warn them that the prospects of maintaining the current rate of con-sumption in the fourth quarter of 1946 and in succeeding quarters are not atpresent bright.R.
