THIS DOOUMEHT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC M&amp;JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1946.&apos; The earepiatsosi of this paper lias hmn sfrietly limited. U is issued for the persoraai use of ........-Jky...ksfr*rr^^....3^hAdfa.......SITUATION IN SOUTH PERSIA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.MY colleagues will be aware that the situation in South Persia has been giving me some concern. I have under consideration the various steps whichcould be taken to safeguard our interests there in the light of the new political conditions now obtaining throughout the country. As a result of Soviet influence in the North the Tudeh Party has been greatly stimulated and strengthened sothat it now exercises a predominant influence even in the South. I am not disposed, however, to take too tragic a view and I am hopeful that, given time,it may prove possible to wean the Tudeh Party, or at least some part of itsadherents, from extremist or Communist courses. To judge by the Party&apos;programme, which in all the circumstances is by no means extreme, this shouldnot be impossible. In particular I am convinced that much can be clone by meansof sympathetic treatment of labour and social welfare in the oilfields. Membersof Parliament have recently visited the area, whilst a high official of the Ministryof Fuel and Power has been sent to Tehran to advise on technical matters. what i may describe as the curative and long-term treatment of the problem is therefore in hand.Such remedial measures must of necessity take time. In the meanwhile Iam anxious to avoid being caught by any emergency. His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Tehran, who has also recently visited the oilfields, has reported that the TudehParty has been inciting to violence against the British employees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and that the Persian authorities may be unable to main-tain order in the event of troubles occurring. I must therefore request authorityfor certain emergency plans as outlined below to be put into action only in theevent of sudden necessity.The numbers of the British and Indian employees of the Company are asfollows : 2,150 British, with 800 wives and children; and2,700 Indians, with 950 wives and children.- The Chiefs of Staff have been preparing plans for (a) evacuating British and Indian personnel from the oilfields area withthe help of the Roysil Air Force;(&amp;) occupying the Abadan area in order to protect the lives of the Company&apos;semployees concentrated there and to guard the valuable refineryinstallations.The Chiefs of Staff have also under consideration the further question of occupying the oilfields area itself if it becomes necessary to do so, in order that production may continue. In this connexion, I should draw attention to amemorandum circulated to the Defence Committee, No. D.O. (46) 45 of the13427   [32128]TOP SECRET. Copy No.   38CP. (46) 269.11th July, 1946.CABINET.
28th March, in which the Minister of Fuel and Power stressed the need to safe-guard1 our Middle East supplies of oil for our vital strategic needs and ourequally vital economic and industrial needs.I am particularly anxious to ensure that preparation for such measures should not be taken in any ostentatious way such as might precipitate the verysituation which we wish to avoid. I do not myself believe the situation to beas grave as it may appear. I must, however, be prepared for eventualities which,in the light of our reports from Persia, cannot be altogether excluded. Whilst,therefore, asking for authority for the preparation of plans as indicated above,I would assure my colleagues that I would not recommend any such drastic action as the re-entry of British troops into Persia unless I was convinced that therewas no other way of saving British lives. I should accordingly arrange forHis Majesty&apos;s Consuls at Khorramshahr and Ahwaz, within whose districts the oil Company&apos;s operations lie, to telegraph reports of the situation to me, to ourAmbassadors at Tehran and Bagdad, and to the military authorities in the middle east, and for the Ambassador at Tehran to report at once to me his appreciation of the situation.E. B.Foreign Office, 11th July, 1946.
