The Anglo-American Committee of Enquiry havegiven us no guidance in this respect beyond stating that the constitution shouldbe such that mere numerical majority should not give one race the power to dominate the other. They volunteer no suggestion how this result is to beachieved, but admit that their proposal is likely to result in an almost indefinite period of trusteeship.2. It would seem from the report that the Committee visualise a continuanceof the present system of government, with changes in detail only, but any such arrangement must surely be dismissed as impracticable. We are at presentholding the position (in so far as it is held) by force of arms and can hardly con-template continuing so to hold it for all time; this position, at present bad, willbe made much worse if the recommendations in the report are implemented. Onthe one side, we shall have incurred the undying hostility of the Arabs; on theother, we shall still be subjected by the Zionists, in Palestine and in America, to pressure in favour of an ultimate Jewish State and shall still have to face theproblem of illegal immigration, which, at the last, we know ourselves powerless tocontrol.3. Apart, moreover, from purely practical considerations, it would probablybe found impossible to draft a Trusteeship Agreement perpetuating the presentsystem of government which would not be open to serious challenge as con-travening Article 76 (6.) of the Charter of the United Nations. This Articlelays down, as one of the basic objectives of the trusteeship system, the progressive development towards self-government or independence of the inhabitants of the trust Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the peopleconcerned. It would be difficult to argue that the existing regime in palestine is designed to operate to these ends.4. It is, of course, too early to forecast the results of the forthcoming officialconversations, but it is at least possible that the verdict will be that it is impracticable to implement the Committee&apos;s recommendations as a whole. should that be the case, it is clearly desirable that we should have concrete proposals to advance in place of them.5. The only indication given by the Committee of their views on long-term policy (other than the general statement, already referred to, that numericalmajority shall not confer powers of domination) is in the recommendation madein paragraph 4 of Chapter X that local administrative areas might be formed,some purely Arab or Jewish in composition, but some of mixed population wherea corporate sense of civic responsibility can be encouraged and a new beginning[32094]
made in the development of self-government. The Palestine Government hasprepared an outline scheme of such a system, providing for six administrativeareas or counties, with area councils which would be entrusted with responsibilityfor the administration of social services, agricultural and veterinary matters,and public works of &quot; county &quot; origin. These councils would also act as spokes-men for their areas before the central government.6. Another plan designed to encourage self-government has been worked out in amplification of the Committee&apos;s suggestion, made under Recommenda-tions Nos. 5 and 9, that an Arab Community, similar to the Jewish Communityalready in existence, should be established in Palestine to control Arab social services and education. The plan envisages the creation of two Communities,one Arab&apos; and one Jewish, responsible for a considerable range of subjectscapable of being administered on communal lines, and acting as spokesmenbetween the respective Communities and Government.7. Both schemes present certain difficulties (as must any scheme for govern-ment in Palestine) but both would be worthy of close examination were it decidedto maintain the essentials of the present system of government and merely totake steps to encourage the growth of local autonomy within that framework.But, should it be found that the present system cannot be maintained, neitherplan is designed to provide an alternative. They are not nearly far-reacliingenough to form the basis for a new start, and, in particular, they leave all thedifficulties connected with immigration outstanding and do little to solve theburning question of land sales.8. The fact has to be faced that progress in the solution of the problems with which Palestine is confronted, including progress towards the attainment of self-government, is likely to be negligible for so long as Palestine continuesas a unitary bi-national State. In such a State, one of two alternative formsof democratic government is possible. Either the majority must rule (analternative which the Committee categorically rejects) or the representation ofthe two races must be on the basis of parity. The latter alternative, seeing thatthe Arabs and the Jews are at variance on every matter of importance, could onlylead to a complete deadlock in the administration. It is difficult to escape theconclusion that a bi-national State in Palestine, other than one administeredas at present by a bureaucratic Government under the aegis of the machine-gun,is an impracticable conception. This was the finding of the Royal Commissionten years ago; the happenings of subsequent years have served to emphasise itsvalidity and to reinforce the Commission^ view that the only hope of a solutionlies in some arrangement which will, to the greatest possible extent, allow eachrace to manage its own affairs.9. Such an arrangement might take one of two forms, either partition intoindependent States or the creation of semi-autonomous areas under a centralTrustee Government. The former is the solution recommended by the RoyalCommission and there have lately been indications of a certain swing of opinion in favour of it on the part of both Arabs and Jews. It has, of course, alwaysbeen recognised that it is fraught with grave difficulties and the difficulties havenot decreased with the passage of time. The background of the problem hasalso changed with the establishment of the United Nations and a new complica-tion has thereby been created. Even assuming (a somewhat doubtful assumption)that both communities could be induced to accept partition in principle, it is certain that either would emphatically reject any boundary which would satisfy the other. An endless wrangle would ensue and one in &quot;which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Government of the United States could hardly claim theposition of sole arbiters. The boundaries of new States being in question, thematter would probably have to be fought out before the United Nations and aquick, decision would be highly improbable. It is, indeed, likely that neither side would accept independence in any area to which the other could be brought toagree, and the United Nations would scarcely be prepared to force independence on an unwilling people. During this period either we should have to deal withshort-term policy, including the recommendations in the report, without any ideaof what the ultimate long-term policy was to be (a course which it seems mostimportant to avoid) or we should have to postpone all action until the long-term policy was finally settled. The latter course would result in an impossiblesituation. Apart from the question of countering pressure from America, some-thing positive must be done in the near future if only because of the impossibility of stemming illegal immigration if the legal intake is not increased.
10. The best hope may thus well lie in the adoption of the alternativearrangement, namely, the creation of semi-autonomous areas under a centralTrustee Government. A description of a scheme on these lines (prepared beforethe Anglo-American Committee reported) is contained in the Annex* and mayform a basis for discussion. It is not contended that the scheme is free fromserious difficulties, both administrative and financial, but the same is true of any scheme that could possibly be devised. There is certainly no easy road out of ourpresent embarrassments.11. The great advantage of this type of partition is the fact that it can beeffected unilaterally at any time as a mere change in the present system of administering Palestine, since it involves no departure from the provisions of theMandate. We could thus, if the scheme were brought into force, approach thequestion of Trusteeship at our own time and on our own terms. Although, for theproper operation of the plan, it would be necessary for each community to assumecharge of its own area, refusal to do so would not prevent its being brought intoforce. In the event of such refusal, the central Government would, for the timebeing, administer the area in question. It may well be held that Palestine wouldbe easier to administer in this way, which would admit of a pro-Jewish bias inone part and a pro-Arab bias in the other, than it is under the existing systemwhere the scales have to be held evenly balanced throughout.12. Under the scheme, since the Mandate would remain unaltered, our strategic position in Palestine would remain exactly as it is at present, and weshould continue to have at our disposal all the facilities which we now enjoy.13. There would seem to be quite a reasonable chance of securing UnitedStates support to the plan, as it would permit of the admission of the 100,000immigrants recommended by the Committee. Nor should Arab repercussions tothe immigration, if affected against the background of a provincial autonomyscheme, be too severe. The resulting Jewish settlement would be confined to adefinite and comparatively small compartment of Palestine and the fear of theremainder of eventual displacement or submergence would be thereby removed.It is undoubtedly fear of such displacement and submergence which has madethe Palestinian Arabs place the repeal of the Land Transfers Regulations,together with the indefinite continuance of Jewish immigration, in the forefrontof their attack on the Committee&apos;s proposals.14. From the point of view of the Arab States (who are obviously seriouslyperturbed about the whole question and who must realise that a compromise isnecessary) there would seem to be some advantage at least in a plan which freedthree-quarters of the Palestinian Arabs, once and for all, from any fear of Jewishdomination, granted a semi-autonomous status, with prospects of full ultimateautonomy, to the great majority of them and provided powerful safeguards forthe protection of the rights of the remaining quarter.15. The scheme has the advantage that, while providing a type of constitu-tion which should be immediately workable, it leaves the door wide open for further advance. Such advance might be in one of two directions. The two provincesmight elect to become partners in a federal constitution; the prospect of Anglo-Jewish co-operation in such a federation is at least far greater than that of their co-operation in any form of unitary government. On the other hand, if thecentrifugal forces proved to be too strong, partition might be the ultimate out-come. There is no reason now to prejudge the final decision; provincial autonomyappears to provide a convenient stepping-stone to either federation or partitionand the choice between them can be left to be made when the present explosiveatmosphere has disappeared and in the light of the conditions then prevailing.G.

ANNEX.A SCHEME OF PROVINCIAL AUTONOMY FOR PALESTINE.A. Conditions to be Satisfied.NO scheme for the future administration of Palestine is likely to provesuccessful unless it takes into account the salient feature of the situation, namely,that there is no common ground between the two races primarily concerned.Their national aspirations are completely irreconcilable; they differ in character, in culture, in social life, in religion and in language. experience has shown that there is, for the present at least, no hope of agreement betweenthem on any of the main issues which must be determined before stable govern-ment can be established in the country, least of all on the vital question of immigration. As the Royal Commission emphasised, national assimilationbetween Arabs and Jews is ruled out by their conflicting loyalties and to main-tain that Palestinian citizenship has any moral meaning is a mischievouspretence.  Neither Arab nor Jew has any sense of service to a single State.2. In such circumstances, to plan for a bi-national State, which necessarilypremises a high degree of co-operation between the two races, is to ignore the realities of the case. There is little or no hope of this co-operation being realised.Consequently, any constitutional arrangements designed to replace the presentsystem of government must, to be workable, be such as to give to each race thelargest practicable measure of control over its own affairs and the smallestpracticable power of interference in the affairs of the other.3. Any plan for the future government of Palestine should further satisfy the following conditions : (i) The plan should have, as its ultimate objective, the termination of trusteeship and the handing over of the government of the country tothe people of the country,(ii) The plan should be such as to afford a clear definition of the Trustee&apos;sdual obligation to the Jews on the one side and to the Arabs on theother.(iii) The plan should be such as to satisfy, to the greatest practicable extent,the undertakings which have been given by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in respect of the establishment of the Jewish National Home,and should afford scope both for the consolidation of the work already done by the Jews in Palestine and for the further development of theHome.(iv) The plan should, to the greatest practicable extent, secure compliance with that article of the Mandate which enjoins that Jewish settle-ment should be encouraged only in so far as the rights and position ofother sections of the population are not prejudiced thereby.(v) The plan should be one which, in practice, it will be possible to enforce.(vi) The plan should make specific provision for safeguarding the integrity of Jerusalem as the centre of Christianity, the Zion of the Jews andthe third most sacred city of Islam.4. It is believed that the scheme of Provincial Autonomy, which is described below, satisfies all these conditions and goes as far as is possible towardsreconciling the conflicting claims of the two races.[32094a] b
5. The outline of a scheme on somewhat similar lines under the name of&quot; Cantonisation &quot; was put forward as long ago as 1936 by Mr. Archer Gustin the Journal of the Royal Central Asian Society. The Royal Commissiondiscussed this scheme in Chapter XXI of their Report but rejected it in favourof their own plan for the partition of Palestine into independent Arab and jewish States. Subsequent analysis has shown that the implementation of theRoyal Commission^ proposals would involve almost insuperable difficulties. Inthese circumstances, there would seem to be grounds for reconsidering analternative which, while obviating the most formidable of these difficulties,secures some at least of the main advantages of Partition.B. General Description of the Provincial Autonomy Plan.6. The Provincial Autonomy plan envisages the substitution of a systemof local autonomy for the present governmental regime. Under this system, areas(which, following the nomenclature adopted in other Colonies, might be designated as &quot; provinces &quot;) would be demarcated in which one or other racewas already predominant; the inhabitants of each such province would be givenresponsibility for the administration of its internal affairs, such as education,agriculture, public health, public works, land settlement and registration, andthe like. The central Trustee government would exercise powers of super-intendence, direction and control over the activities of the provincial governments and would administer directly subjects of all-Palestine importance, such as foreign relations, defence, customs, railways, harbours and posts and telegraphs.Jerusalem, as a religious metropolis common to three religions, would be excludedfrom the area to be locally governed and would be administered by the Trusteeas a separate enclave. In pursuance of the policy of non-interference, a provincialadministration (or the Trustee in respect of the Jerusalem enclave) would beempowered to make regulations restricting the rights of persons, other thanpersons resident in its area on the date of the coming into force of the scheme, topurchase land or to take up permanent residence within its jurisdiction.7. It would be possible, under this system, to define in clear terms the dualobligation imposed on the Mandatory by the Mandate. There would be an area in which Jewish close settlement would be permitted and encouraged, in dischargeof the positive obligation regarding the National Home, and in which the jews would, to a very large degree, be free to manage their own affairs. There wouldbe another area which would be reserved for the needs of the indigenous popula-tion and within which that population would be able to regulate its doings inaccordance with its own traditions and modes of life.C. Boundaries of the Provinces and of the Enclave.(i) Principles to be observed.8. The boundaries proposed for the provinces and the enclave are shown inthe map accompanying this note; they have been drawn in accordance with thefollowing principles : (i) The Jewish province should include from the outset more Jews thanArabs. Otherwise it would be necessary for the Jews either to imposepolitical limitations on the Arabs or to resort to uneconomicimmigration designed solely to increase the Jewish population.(ii) The Jewish province should include as many Jews and as much Jewishland as possible.(iii) Substantial areas which are wholly or almost wholly Arab in respectboth of population and of land should, so far as possible, not beincluded in the Jewish province.(iv) As much land, Arab and Jewish, as is consistent with the fulfilment of conditions (i) and (iii) should be included in the Jewish province.9. The extent to which the delimitation shown on the map conforms tothe principles set out in the preceding paragraph is described below. In theabsence of a census, any population statistics can only be approximate. those used are based upon a village by village estimate made in April 1943, plus a percentage addition to bring the total population figure to that adopted as thepopulation in December 1944 for the purpose of the official demographic statistics of Palestine.  An addition of 40,000 has been made to the official estimate of the
Jewish population to cover Jews who have entered Palestine illegally and whotherefore find no place in the official records. A somewhat larger addition wouldprobably have been justified but its exact magnitude is, in the nature of things,unknown.(a) Inclusion of a Jewish majority in the Jewish province.10. The population of the Jewish province would consist of 451,000 jews and 301,000 Arabs, giving a Jewish majority of 150,000.(b) Inclusion of the maximum number of Jews in the Jewish province.11. The Jewish population of Palestine would be divided as follows betweenthe two provinces and the enclave :  Number.       Percentage.Jewish province       ...      .......      451,000 79-4Jerusalem enclave    ..........      102,000 18-0Arab province............        15,000 2-6Total .........      568,000 100-00(c) Omission from the Jewish province of wholly or almost wholly Arab areas.12. The following areas have been excluded from the Jewish province inaccordance with this condition : Land holdingsPopulation. in sq. miles.Area. Arabs. Jews.        Arabs.       Jews.Galilee    ......... 118,000          2,000 555 11Central Judaea...... 461,000 2,000 2,883         23Jaffa town and suburbs ... 70,000 10,000 south Gaza and North-&quot;West Beersheba       ... 166,000           1,000 - 1,445 35Total   ......      815,000 15,000 4,890 69It is of these areas that it is suggested that the Arab province should be composed. Excluding the urban population of Jaffa, only 5,000 Jews would beleft in that province,(d) Inclusion in the Jewish province of as much land, Arab and Jewish, aspossible.13.   The area of the Jewish province would be as follows : Square miles.Jewish-owned land      ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 518Arab-owned land ....       ...      ......      .....      925Roads, rivers, &amp;c.        ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 31Total   ............      ......      1,474The Jewish province, while containing 88 per cent, of all the Jewish holdingsin Palestine, would contain also nearly twice as much Arab land. The Jews could thus triple their present holdings without obtruding beyond their own province.follows(ii) Population of the Provinces and the Enclave.14.   The population of the provinces and of the enclave would be asA arabs. Jews. Total.Arab province   ...        815,000 15,000 830,000Jewish province...        301,000 451,000 752,000Jerusalem  enclave 96,000 102,000 198,000Total   ...      1,212,000 568,000 1,780,000These figures are satisfactory from the point of view of future constitutional development. Should any type of federal constitution be contemplated at thecentre, neither the Arab nor the Jewish province, their populations being roughlyequal, would have a claim to representation on any basis other than parity.[32094a] b 2
Similarly, were any popular assembly to be convened to assist in the administra-tion of the enclave, neither race could claim, on the score of population, to have more voice in the matter than the other.(iii) Nature of the Provincial Boundaries.15. Under the scheme proposed, the provincial boundaries would be purelyadministrative boundaries, defining the area within which a local legislature was empowered to legislate on certain subjects and within which no person, notoriginally resident in the area, might establish permanent residence without permission. They would in no sense be &apos;&apos; frontiers &apos;&apos; and they would conse-quently have no significance as regards defence, customs or communications.Their somewhat tortuous nature would thus be no disadvantage. There wouldbe no need for corridors (a much criticised feature of the Royal Commission^partition scheme) to join island areas; there are cases both in England and inIndia of detached areas being administered, without difficulty, by a parent county or province. Thus Galilee and, more important still, Jaffa (the boundaries ofwhich town would be readjusted so as to exclude the almost wholly Jewishnorthern suburbs) would, for purposes of administration, form part of the Arabprovince.16. There is no reason why administrative boundaries of this nature shouldinterfere in any way with the development of the country&apos;s natural resources.Irrigation schemes, promoted by one province but passing through and providingwater against payment to another, are common inter-provincial practice in India.In point of fact, the configuration of Palestine and the location of the sources ofsupply are such that the vast bulk of the land which is susceptible of development by irrigation must necessarily lie within the Jewish province. The only consider-able irrigable area in the Arab province is in the extreme south of the coastal plainaround Gaza, and a large portion of this can only be irrigated if the LebaneseGovernment is prepared to make water from the Litani and Zehrani Rivers inthe Lebanon available for the purpose. This would certainly not be the case if theland in question were included in the Jewish province.D. Division of Subjects.17. The following is a distribution of subjects between the central goverh-ment and the provincial administrations which might be adopted on the inceptionof the scheme.Provincial A dministraUon.Administration (Provincial, district and Municipal).Agriculture.Buildings.Co-operative Societies.Development.Education.Excise.Fisheries.Forests.Irrigation.Land Registration.Land Sales.Land Settlement.Printing and Stationery.Public Health.Residential Qualifications.Roads.Trade and Industry.Some of these subjects, such as Antiquities, Statistics and Surveys, have been allocated to the Central Government on the score of general convenience and economy and not because any political considerations are involved in their adminis-tration. The most difficult questions which arise in connection with the divisionof functions are those of the allocation of responsibility for immigration and for law and order, the latter including the administration of the police and of thecourts.   These subjects are dealt with in somewhat greater detail below.Central Government.Administration (Central).Antiquities.Audit.Broadcasting.Civil Aviation.Customs.Defence.Foreign Relations.Harbours.Immigration.Justice.Police and Prisons.Posts and Telegraphs.Probation.Railways.Statistics.Surveys.
(i) Immigration.18. The treatment of immigration will always be the crux of any schemefor the administration of Palestine and, having demarcated an area for theeconomic condition of which the Jews would be responsible, there would be obviousadvantages in allowing them to control their own immigration into it. Underthe present procedure, it falls to the Mandatory to decide how many immigrantscan be admitted without creating unemployment; if employment for them is not forthcoming, the Mandatory is responsible for their support. The criterionof &quot; economic absorptive capacity &quot; might well take on a new meaning in Jewisheyes if the responsibility both for determining the extent of immigration and,subsequently, for providing for the immigrants admitted were transferred fromthe Mandatory and placed squarely on the Jews themselves.19. It is, however, certain that the Arabs, in their present temper, wouldviolently resist any scheme which contemplated the handing over of control of immigration to the Jews. They would see the Jewish province as a threat to the integrity of the neighburing Arab territory; they would picture its being inten-tionally filled until it perforce burst its limits and poured out over its boundaries.Until these fears can be allayed and better relations can be established betweenthe two communities, there appears to be no alternative to the retention ofcontrol by the Trustee. But the position would be much easier under a system oflocal autonomy than it is at present. Since immigration would be into an areaalready predominantly Jewish and which it was definitely intended should become more Jewish still, the sole measure of its permissible extent would be the economicabsorptive capacity of the area. The Trustee would not have to take into con-sideration the &quot; political high level &quot; which the Royal Commission recommendedshould limit, and which, in fact, always tended to affect, the quotas issued underthe old system. Illegal immigration would also lose many of its dangers if itsrepercussions fell to be borne exclusively by the provincial government. Thelatter would be unlikely either to organise or to encourage it if the quotasgenuinely reflected the economic situation, with the result that the admission ofillegals spelt unemployment, industrial unrest and financial embarrassment.These factors would loom much larger if, on the one hand, responsibility fordealing with them had passed to a Jewish government and, on the other, the incentive to establish a majority status in the whole of Palestine had been removed.(ii) Law and Order.20. The allocation of responsibility for the administration of law and order,and particularly for the control of the police, raises important issues. Inprinciple, it is clearly desirable that these subjects should form part of the responsibilities of the provincial governments. It can be argued that one of themain reasons for the present high expenditure on police in Palestine is the factthat the maintenance of law and order is regarded as a wholly governmentalfunction, for which the two communities have no responsibility, and in the dis-charge of which they do not consider themselves as in any way bound to co-operate.If internal security in the provinces were guaranteed by the central government,it would, theoretically at least, be open to a provincial government to proceedwith impunity in both the executive and legislative spheres on lines which mightevoke serious reactions on the part of sections of the population, safe in the know-ledge that the central government, and not itself, would have the task of facingand suppressing any resulting trouble.21. In normal circumstances, this argument would probably be conclusive,but circumstances are not normal and choice has to be made between desirabilityand practical expediency. The security situation in Palestine is at present sobad, and lawlessness is so general and widespread, that to initiate a new plan byhanding over control of the internal security forces to the elements who are primarily responsible for the present disturbed state of the country would be to incur grave risk of further trouble. For this reason, it would seem essential that,in the first stages of the scheme at least, the maintenance of law and order shouldbe a central responsibility, in spite of the weight of the arguments to the contrary.The ultimate transfer of this responsibility to the provincial governments would,be envisaged, but the actual transfer would not take place until the presentexplosive atmosphere had disappeared and until the provincial governments had shown by their actions that the responsibilities in question could safely beentrusted to them.
22. It would be useless to expect an immediate change of heart on the partof all concerned or an immediate end of disturbances and disorders due tonationalistic antagonism or racial dissension. Nor is it by any means certainthat it would be possible, at the outset, to trust the new governments to dealimpartially with such outbreaks. A situation might thus arise which would call for the intervention of the High Commissioner in the discharge of his ultimate responsibility for the peace and tranquillity of Palestine. Having no other force at his disposal for the purpose, he would be obliged to call on the military, acourse which would clearly be undesirable. It would be highly uneconomical toretain a special body of police at the disposal of the High Commissioner foruse solely in such exceptional circumstances, yet there is no doubt that police and not military should be used for the quelling of civil disturbance. The onlysolution would thus appear to be for the central government to retain control ofthe police for the time being, thus admitting of the retention of the presentBritish Section, which is invaluable in circumstances such as those envisaged, but which would certainly disappear, except in the Jerusalem enclave, with thetransfer of control to the provincial governments. Such transfer would be deferred until those governments had settled down, in the hope that racial feelingwould in the meantime have subsided to such an extent as to render outbreaksimprobable.23. The retention, temporarily at least, of the control of the police wouldalso do much to reassure the 300,000 Arabs who would remain in the Jewishprovince that they would not be subjected to victimisation.24. The control of the courts is, to some extent at least, bound up withthat of the police; completely to separate the two and to entrust them to differentauthorities would create a situation which could hardly but lead to frictionIt is therefore suggested that, in the initial stages of the scheme, the administra-tion of justice should be a central responsibility. When the time came for thetransfer of the control of the police, it should be possible to transfer also thecontrol of the local, that is to say, the magistrates&apos; and district courts, the centralgovernment maintaining a High Court and a Court of Appeal. Control of Prisonsand of the probation service should also follow the control of the police.E. Defence.25. The question of defence is an important one, in view of its bearing on the stability of Palestine and, indeed, of the Middle East as a whole. It isa cardinal feature of the scheme that, in its initial stages at least, defence should be the responsibility of the Trustee and that the provincial governments should have no power- either to legislate or to take executive action in such manner as to interfere with the discharge of this responsibility.F.-Division of Revenues.26. Each province would appropriate the revenues (such as property tax,income tax, excise and the like) which accrued within its area, other thanthe revenues arising from activities assigned to the central government. Fromthe latter revenues the central government would first defray its own expenditure and then pass the balance to the provinces in the form of subsidies. Some 60 percent, of Palestine&apos;s revenue is attributable to customs, ports, railways, and posts and telegraphs and would, under the division of functions proposed, be collected by the central government.27. It is impossible, without a complete analysis of past accounts, whichcould only be made in Palestine, to pronounce definitely on the probable financialpositions of the central and provincial governments. Since, in normal times, thePalestine railway operates at a loss, the joint revenues from railways, ports andposts and telegraphs would not be likely to do more than cover the cost of theoperation of those services. The cost of general central administration and ofother central departments would thus fall to be met mainly from customs dues.As, however, customs dues form by far the largest single item of Palestine revenue,there should, even after meeting the central demand, be a substantial balanceavailable for distribution between the two provinces.28. The distribution of customs revenue should be so effected that the shareof each province would be roughly proportional to the value of the dutiable goodsconsumed by it.  This arrangement would dispose of the present Jewish grievance
that a large proportion of the taxation derived from the Jewish population isappropriated by government to make up the deficit in the Arab areas. Statisticalcustoms post would be established on the railway and on the main roads (similarto those established for the same purpose on the Trans-Jordan frontier) toenable these shares to be evaluated.29. The financial arrangements proposed would have three distinctadvantages. First, they would give to the central government the power of thepurse. In India, the reverse was the case; under the Act of 1919, the centralgovernment operated at a deficit which had to be made good by contributions from the provinces, a perennial source of complaint. Secondly, they would enablethe Jews to convert into legitimate forms of taxation the levies now exacted, byother and less desirable means, from the Jewish population towards the main-tenance of Jewish social services of a standard which government could not possibly afford to provide for the country as a whole. Thirdly, they would makeit clear to the Arabs that any differentiation between the standard of services provided for themselves and for the Jews was based not on racial discriminationbut on capacity and willingness to pay for them; the Arabs would have thepower to impose local taxation at their discretion and it would be largely for themselves to determine the standards to be established.30. The question of the viability of the three units under the financial arrangements proposed is dealt with at somewhat greater length in paragraphs 52to 61 below.G.- Constitutional Arrangements.(i) Constitutional Arrangements in the Provinces.(a) The Provincial Legislature.31. A legislative Council would be set up in each province. The council would be elected on a basis which would be laid down in the Instrument whichcalled the whole scheme into being and which would include due provision forthe representation of minorities. Except in respect of matters expressly reservedfor central legislation, the Council would be entitled to legislate on all subjectsdeclared to be the responsibility of the provincial government. The Speakers ofthe two Councils would be nominated by the Trustee; with this exception, the council&apos;s would consist wholly of elected members. The Speakers would, so faras possible, disassociate themselves from the political implications of their duties and. apply themselves merely to seeing that any restrictions imposed by the instrument on the powers of the Councils both to debate and to legislate onsubjects were observed.32. As was done in the Government of India Act of 1919, certain centralenactments affecting provincial subjects would be declared by the Instrument tobe of all-Palestine application and as such not subject to amendment or repealby the local legislature, save with the prior consent of the High Commissioner.It would, for example, almost certainly be desirable to retain a common CriminalCode, applicable throughout Palestine. In order that the Arabs in the Jewishprovince might not be dispossessed of their land on any but equitable terms, theLand (Expropriation) Ordinance would continue in force and the local legislaturewould have no power to vary it. There would doubtless be other matters inrespect of which it would be advisable, in the first instance at least, to subject the activities of provincial governments to central legislation; by the adoptionof this expedient, a very real protection could be afforded to the essential interestsof minority communities.33. Restrictions would also be necessary to rule out the discussion in thelegislature of cases sub judice in the courts, discussions likely to impair relationswith foreign States, resolutions which trenched on the authority of the centralgovernment, and others. There would also be restrictions on the introductionof Bills; it would not, for example, be open to a local legislature to vary bymeans of a rebate or surcharge (unless such variation had received the previousassent of the High Commissioner) any tax, such as customs duties or postal charges, imposed by the central government, to legislate so as to avoid its debtobligations or to pass laws affecting defence, foreign relations or other centralsubjects. It would be the duty of the Speakers to see that no discussion tookplace and to disallow the introduction of Bills which infringed the restrictionsthus laid down.
34. The assent of the High Commissioner would be required to all Billspassed by the local legislature, but the Instrument would provide that such assentshould only be refused in stated circumstances as, for example, if the High Com-missioner considered that the legislation menaced the peace or tranquillity of theprovince or of Palestine or that it discriminated against the legitimate interestsof minorities.35. The legislature would further be responsible for voting supply for provincial services. The amount so to be voted would, to the greatest possible extent, be left to its discretion, but it would be necessary to arm the High Com-missioner with power to ensure that adequate supply was provided for subjects which affected his essential responsibilities, such as services to minority com-munities. He might be authorised, if dissatisfied with the supply voted, torequire that a sum fixed by him should be so provided, or preferably, if the centralsubsidy sufficed for the purpose, to require that all or a stated portion of thesubsidy should be earmarked for expenditure on the subject in question and notbe diverted to any other object.(b) The Provincial Executive.36. A Chief Minister and a Council of Ministers would be appointed by theHigh Commissioner from among the members of the local legislature and inconsultation with the leaders of the latter. The High Commissioner would alsoappoint a Representative in each province, and the provincial government wouldbe required to keep this Representative constantly apprised of its proceedings and to give him any information in that connection for which he might ask.The Representative would act as the normal channel of communication betweenthe High Commissioner and the provincial government; in forwarding proposals from the latter it would be open to him to add his own comments, framed in thelight of his special knowledge of local politics and conditions. He would alsobe responsible for reporting to the High Commissioner any actions of the executivewhich, in his opinion, trespassed beyond the sphere assigned for such actions inthe Instrument or which appeared to call for intervention by the High Com-missioner in the discharge of any of his special responsibilities, such, for example,as the safeguarding of minority rights. Even if the provincial government didnot, on its own initiative, keep the Representative as diligently informed of itsactions as the Instrument required, information would certainly come to him from other sources in any important case and he would then be in a position to demand a full account.(ii) Constitutional Arrangements at the Centre.37. It would probably be best, at the outset of the scheme, to make noarrangements for immediate constitutional development at the centre. As hasalready been stated, there is at present no common ground between the two communities and any representative central government would consequently bea house divided against itself; the strife which would almost inevitably be thereengendered might well imperil the success of the scheme as a whole. Pendingan improvement in the present strained relations between the communities,authority, both executive and legislative, should continue as at present to be vested in the High Commissioner, assisted by a small official Executive Council.The High Commissioner would, however, be required to do his utmost to associaterepresentatives of the two provinces with the departments responsible for theadministration of those central subjects in which the provinces had a live concern,and it should be possible to proceed on such lines, to the creation of advisoryboards, for railways, posts and telegraphs, customs and the like, on whichrepresentatives of the provinces and enclave would sit to discuss with and toadvise government how the interests of their territories could best be served bythe departments concerned. This procedure might, in course of time, lead to the amalgamation of the boards and to the formation of a constitutional body at thecentre, representative of the Trustee, the enclave and the two provinces, with power to legislate on all-Palestine and central subjects. It is thought, however,that any such development should be left for future consideration after theprovincial governments have settled down in their saddles and demonstratedtheir aptitude for constructive work within their own spheres.
(iii) Administration of the Jerusalem Enclave.38. For the purpose of the administration of the Jerusalem enclave, a council, somewhat on the lines of a municipal council, would be constituted with powers similar to those of a municipality. The two races would be equallyrepresented on this council, there being approximately equal numbers of arabs and Jews in the enclave; there would also be a number of official members, in viewof the undivided responsibility of the Trustee to safeguard the integrity of theFloly Places. The powers of the council would be executive only; legislative authority would continue to be exercised as at present by the High Commissioner.(iv) Responsibilities and Powers of High Commissioner.39. The High Commissioner would have certain specific responsibilitieslaid upon him, the most important of which would be the prevention of any gravemenace to the peace or tranquillity of Palestine and the safeguarding of therights of minorities. Acting in discharge of these specific responsibilities, butnot otherwise, he would be empowered to issue orders as to the manner in whichthe executive authority of a provincial government should be exercised and, ifnecessary, to dissolve the legislature and to order new elections. In the last resort, if he were satisfied that a situation had arisen in which the governmentof a province could no longer be carried on in accordance with the provisions ofthe Instrument, he would be empowered to assume to himself all or any of thepowers vested in or exercisable by the provincial executive or legislature.40. Safeguards are bound to bulk large in any scheme of constitutional development, and this may result in a distorted picture being presented of the-proposals as a whole. In point of fact, although substantial and even drasticreserve powers must be secured to the High Commissioner, there is no reason to suppose that he would require to use them. Under the system described, a very real degree of autonomy, both administrative and financial, would be delegated to the provinces in respect of all matters most nearly affecting the daily lives oftheir populations. Once the provincial governments had decided to take over-charge, they would be unlikely to indulge in action which would produce chaosin their territories. The amount of interference exercised from above would depend entirely on their own proceedings, and it is hardly too much to anticipate that they would, in general, order those proceedings so as to reduce such inter-ference to ia minimum. The Trustee would be represented in the provinces by twoofficers exercising no executive functions but charged merely with seeing thatthe constitutional powers delegated to the local governments were not exceeded;;within these genuinely extensive powers they would have the fullest freedom.H. Extent to which the prescribed Conditions are satisfied by the Plan..41. A brief description having been given of the system of government proposed for adoption, it remains to discuss to what extent the arrangementssuggested satisfy the conditions set out in paragraph 3 above.(i) Ultimate Constitutional Development.42. The system of government proposed contains within itself the seeds ofdevelopment in that the sphere of local self-government could be graduallywidened by the transfer of additional subjects from central to provincial controland by the withdrawal of safeguards no longer found to be necessary. It alsosatisfies the primary demand of the Trusteeship system, that it should have, as its ultimate aim, the termination of Trusteeship and the handing over of govern-ment to the people of the country. Advance to this end might be in one of two-directions. The procedure of associating representatives of the two provinceswith the administration of central subjects might lead to an ultimate federal constitution; the prospect of Arab-Jewish co-operation in such a federation isat least far greater than that of their co-operation in any form of unitarygovernment. On the contrary, if the centrifugal forces proved to be too strong,Partition maybe the ultimate outcome. But Partition by agreement, along knownlines of cleavage and after a period of experiment in provincial autonomy, wouldbe a far easier and less contentious matter than it would be if imposed as the initial solution. The Trustee would adopt the attitude that it was prepared to hand over the government of the country to the people of the country as soonas the two races expressed a common desire to that end and presented an agreedscheme which would ensure its stable administration. Until that time, the trusteeship regime would continue.[32094a] c
(ii) Definition of the Dual Obligation.43. As stated in paragraph 7, the plan admits of a clear definition of the dual obligation of the Trustee to the Arabs and the Jews. There would be one area in which Jewish close settlement would be permitted and encouraged; therewould be another which would be reserved for the needs of the indigenouspopulation.(iii) Possibility of Consolidation and Development within the Jewish Province.44. The Jewish province would contain 79 per cent, of the Jewish popula-tion of Palestine (the bulk of the remainder being in the Jerusalem enclave) and88 per cent, of the Jewish-owned land. It would contain the two industrial citiesof Haifa and Tel Aviv. Almost all the Jewish industries (the only importantexception being the potash works on the Dead Sea) would be within the province,and many of the Arab industries as well. The province would contain the bestland in Palestine, including 99 per cent, of all Jewish-owned citrus and 85 percent, of all the citrus grown in the country, Arab and Jewish. This is animportant asset since citrus is Palestine&apos;s most valuable crop and, in peace-time,its principal export. The large amount of Arab citrus land included in theJev/ish province would constitute a valid Arab grievance, but it is unavoidableif the Jews are to be given the area in which their settlements are situated, sincehere Arab and Jewish groves are inextricably intermixed. The relative value ofthe land within the Jewish province can be judged from the fact that its ruralproperty tax assessment is more than two and a half times as great as the ruralproperty tax assessment of the remainder of Palestine.. 45. Objection would doubtless be raised to the scheme by the Jews on thescore of the small size of the province; this is an inevitable feature of any reasonable scheme of this nature, since Palestine is, even viewed as a whole, onlya small country and room must be left for the Arab population, which numbersnearly a million and a quarter. Any claim that the province would be too smallto absorb a considerable number of new immigrants is, however, easy to refute.Of the total Jewish population of Palestine, 64 per cent, live in the four cities of jerusalem, Haifa, Tel Aviv and Jaffa, 18 per cent, in the smaller towns and only18 per cent, in the rural settlements. In the result, 82 per-cent, of the population are living on an area of less than 90 square miles, including the rural area farmedby the inhabitants of the smaller towns. In the light of these figures it is difficultto argue that a province containing nearly 1,500 square miles would afford, on theground of size, no scope for a further substantial increase of population by wayof immigration, if employment for further immigrants could be found.46. The ideal of a people &quot; rooted in the soil &quot; has always been dear to the zionists, but there are practical limits to the extent to which this ideal is capableof realisation in the circumstances obtaining in Palestine. The Partition Corn-mission, in paragraph 143 of its Report, propounded a formula for determining the absorptive capacity of rural Palestine. Application of this formula showsthat, on the Arab rural land, the actual population is nearly double the popula-tion which the land can economically support. In other words, there is alreadyserious congestion on the Arab land and, since much of it is hill country whichcannot be intensively developed, the amount of further squeezing-up which ispossible is very limited.47. It is clear, therefore, that development on any area which can be allotted to the Jews cannot, in the main, be agricultural; it must depend upon industry,transport and the like, in fact, upon the type of economic activity which will allow of a high concentration of population in a very limited area. For such development there is adequate space within the province. 80 per cent, of all thecultivable land owned by Arabs and 77 per cent, of that owned by Jews is undercereals, the cost of producing which in Palestine is higher than the cost of importing the same quantity from abroad, with the result that in normal timesit is necessary to impose an import duty on wheat and flour in order to render thelocal growing of wheat a paying proposition. If, therefore, area is to be regardedas the criterion of the absorptive capacity of the province, there are more than800 square miles of cereal land,^ Arab and Jewish, within its boundaries whichcould be put to other purposes, industrial or agricultural, without detrimentallyaffecting the economy of the country.
(iv) Protection of the Rights and Position of the Arabs.48. No scheme which involves the subjection of a considerable Arab minorityto domination by a Jewish majority can be introduced without affecting the rightsand position of the former. The most that it is possible to do is to reduce to theminimum consistent with a reasoned scheme the number of Arabs who will be left in the Jewish province and to ensure, by the provision of adequate safeguards,their equitable treatment.   The present Arab population of Palestine would be divided as follows among the three units : -Number. Percentage.Arab Province ..........      815,000 67Jewish Province       ...      ......      301,000 25Jerusalem Enclave    ...       ...      ...        96,000 81,212,000 100It would, of course, be possible by an adjustment of boundaries, to reduce thenumber of Arabs left in the Jewish province. But such adjustment would resultin a further reduction of the area in which the National Home would be free to expand. It is believed that the boundaries proposed result in a scheme whicheffects as fair a compromise as is practicable between the Trusteed conflictingobligations.49. It must further be remembered that the position of the Arab minority in the Jewish province would be entirely different from that of a minority in anindependent State, such as was envisaged in the Royal Commission^ partitionscheme. As already mentioned, safeguards for the protection of its legitimateinterests would be included in the Instrument which called the scheme into being and it would be one of the main responsibilities of the High Commissioner toensure that due effect was given to them.50. Owing to the small number of Jews and the small amount of Jewish landexcluded from the Jewish province there would be no scope for an exchange of population or land on any material scale. But the fewer the Arabs in the Jewishprovince, the more chance would there be of the scheme functioning successfully,and special arrangements, both financial and otherwise, should therefore be madeto assist those Arabs who desire to leave the Jewish province to do so. TheArab peasant is improvident and is also extremely reluctant to leave the spotwhere he was born and has lived; in view of these proclivities, no immediatevoluntary mass immigration would be probable nor could the desired object beachieved by making cash grants to those wishing to leave Assistance shouldtake the form of encouraging and assisting development schemes for their accom-modation in the Arab province and in Trans-Jordan and not of direct grants tothe settlers; the simpler such schemes were, the better, the main criterion being that they should provide a livelihood similar to but better than that to which thesettlers were accustomed in their original home. Where it was a question merely of moving from one side of the Jordan to the other, some at least of the PalestinianArabs would probably take advantage of the opportunities so offered. Newcomers,once having moved, should receive every assistance in settling down; it would be most desirable that the Arab minority in the Jewish province should be reduced as quickly as possible and a few successful settlement schemes would probably bea potent influence in inducing others to migrate.(v) Practicability of the Scheme.51. There can be no doubt that a scheme on the lines proposed is a practical proposition, although financial assistance from the Trustee would be required inorder to launch and further it. The position in this respect of each of the threeconstituent units is described below.(a) Jerusalem Enclave.52. The Jerusalem Enclave would require assistance in the form of capital grants, loans and, for some years at least, recurrent subsidies. Owing partly to lack of funds and partly to the state of public insecurity which has prevailed ever since the Occupation, the Government of Palestine has lived throughout fromhand to mouth and nowhere are the consequent shortcomings more marked thanthey are in Jerusalem. The Government has practically no buildings of its own,[32094a] d
its various activities being housed in hired and often unsuitable accommodation;much also requires to be done in the way of clearing and beautifying the City andin the provision of more adequate water supply and drainage systems.53. Limitations of finance have also prevented the development desirable inthe services, such as educational, health and social services, which Governmentprovides for the inhabitants of Jerusalem. This affects the Arabs in particular,since the Jews supplement from their own resources the grants made to them by government. In the result, in the realm of education for example, a high proportion of the Arab children who apply for admittance to Governmentprimary schools have to be refused owing to lack of room, while practicallyuniversal primary education, with adequate facilities for secondary and higher education thereafter, is available to the Jewish section.54. Differentiation such as this has undoubtedly been a cause of cleavageboth between the two races and between Government and the people as a whole.The allegiance of the Jews has been to their own national institutions, whichaccept responsibility for the supply of adequate services; no such allegiance hasbeen felt towards Government. The Arabs, on the other hand, have seen theJews enjoying benefits far exceeding anything available to them, and the factthat such benefits are paid for by the Jews themselves (either by contributions orfrom foreign subscriptions) has in no way decreased the feeling of jealousy.55. In such circumstances, it is hardly surprising that the gulf between thetwo communities has been an ever widening one, tending to promote the Jewsinto the position of an intelligentsia while relegating the Arabs into that of merehewers of wood and drawers of water. It would be fatal to foster this differentia-tion in the Jerusalem enclave. That enclave should be one in which equalopportunities would be available for all, and where Arab and Jew could livetogether without any feeling that one was the privileged and one the depressedclass. It should be a microcosm so constituted as to induce that attitude ofcommon interest as between Arab and Jew which must eventually be establishedthroughout the Middle East if Jewry is to have any future in that part of theworld.56. A rough estimate has been prepared of the capital cost of providing the Government and municipal works (mainly buildings, water supply and the like) which would be required in the Jerusalem enclave and of the additionalrecurrent cost of supplying adequate social services for all sections of thecommunity. The capital requirement is of the order of  5 million; in addition,an annual recurrent grant of about  200,000 for social services, especiallyeducation and public health, would be needed for some years at least.57. It is difficult to forecast the future financial position of the enclave afterthe present defects have been remedied; its revenues would certainly increase with the establishment of security and in particular the tourist traffic should, onsuch establishment, prove to be a rich source of income. Due weight has been paidto this consideration in framing the estimates of expenditure. It is certain that,given proper provision and organisation, there is in Jerusalem the foundation of a tourist industry which should equal any in the world and the proceeds fromwhich would go a long way towards defraying the cost of the maintenance ofthe enclave.(b) Arab Province.58. The Arab province would be definitely a &quot; deficit&quot; area; its propertytax assessment represents only about 20 per cent, of the assessment of Palestineas a whole and its population consists mainly of small cultivators who pay noincome tax and little in the way of customs duties, since they are neitheraccustomed nor can afford to use imported food or articles in any large degree.The revenue obtainable from the area has always been insufficient to cover thecost of its maintenance. This fact was recognised by the Royal Commission,which recommended, as a feature of its partition scheme, that Parliament shouldbe asked to make a grant of  2 million towards its upkeep after separation.59. A subsidy to the Arab province would be essential, but it is impossible to forecast the exact amount; this could only be done when a separate budget hadbeen framed for the area. It would be unfair, merely for the purpose of intro-ducing a new policy, to deprive it of services which it at present enjoys or to denyto it such development of those services as would probably have been undertaken
had the present governmental regime continued. For anything more, the pro-vincial government would be required to find the cost by the imposition ofadditional taxation.(c) Jeivish Province.60. The Jewish province should certainly be able to support iself; thetaxable capacity of Palestine is largely concentrated in this area and in presentcircumstances part of the taxation raised in it goes to make up the deficit in theArab areas. The Jewish province should, therefore, be better off financially than is Palestine as a whole at present. Its future prosperity and development would depend largely upon the extent to which the Jews were prepared to play their proper role in the Levant and so to condition their industrial economv as to enablethem to manufacture goods at prices not higher than those at which their neigh -bours can obtain them from other sources.(d) General.61. It will thus be seen that the Trustee might find himself called upon toproduce a sum of upwards of  10 million in grants, loans and subsidies, in orderto ensure that the scheme was inaugurated on sound lines. On the other side ofthe ledger, there should be a progressive saving in security expenditure. the implementation of the present policy has, during the past ten years, involvedexpenditure on Police Services amounting to about  20 million over and abovethe normal cost of those services. A considerable proportion of this sum has had tobe provided in the forms of grants-in-aid by His Majesty&apos;s Government. If, there-fore, the implementation of a new policy led to the establishment of a morepeaceful atmosphere, the expenditure envisaged in connection with the scheme should be no more than a gradual diversion of the amount which would otherwise have had to be spent unproductively on the maintenance of law and order to objectsdesigned to promote the reconstruction and development of the country.(vi) Safeguarding of the Integrity of Jerusalem.62. The safeguarding of the integrity of Jerusalem is fully provided for inthe scheme proposed. It is unnecessary to argue in detail the desirability of excluding Jerusalem and its environs from either the Arab or the Jewish province.Jerusalem is a religious metropolis; it has pre-eminence among&quot; all the cities ofChristendom and is an object of veneration by two other great religions, theMohammedan and the Jewish. Although the Jerusalem enclave would be a smallone, its creation, which would safeguard the Holy City, preserve its associations and guarantee freedom of access to all those creeds which hold it sacred, would, inthe eyes of the world, be one of the most important aspects of the scheme.I. The Negeb.63. Prominence has recently been given by various writers on palestine to the possibilities of development in the Negeb. The term &apos;&apos; Negeb &apos;&apos; an oldHebrew appellation meaning &quot; The South,&quot; is loosely used and covers no reallydefined area. It has generally been employed to denote the large tract ofdesert waste lying to the south of the cultivated portion of the Beersheba sub-district, but Jewish writers have, in late years, tended to include under thisname the whole country lying to the south or south-east of Majdal. For thepurpose of this note, the term is used to describe the triangle of land whichextends from the southern edge of the Beduin barley lands in the north-west of the Beersheba sub-district to Aqaba on the gulf bearing that name, asshown in the map appended. The barley lands referred to have been includedin the Arab province. They lie in a tract where the rainfall is both deficientand precarious and where a careful hydrographic survey has shown that nosubsoil water supply exists. Every cultivable acre is already cultivated by theBeduin inhabitants of the tract, who eke out a precarious livelihood from theprocess, the total area available affording to each a holding much below any reasonable subsistence area of cereal land of the kind in question. There is little hope of any great development of these barley lands except in so far as this can be achieved by the improvement of the present methods of dry farming. Thescheme prepared by Mr. Hays shows that only their extreme north-west cornercould be irrigated by surface water and then only if the Lebanese Governmentwere prepared to make such water available from sources in the Lebanon.&apos; F32094a] d 2
64.. The boundary of the Negeb has been drawn so as to exclude the potashworks at the south end of the Dead Sea. The works at the north and southends of the Sea form part of a single undertaking and, as there is continuoustraffic, involving both personnel and materials, between them, anomalies wouldbe bound to arise were they under different Administrations.65. The Negeb south of the boundary suggested covers an area of3,780 square miles, or more than a third of Palestine. The Jews have alwaysheld that, it placed in possession of it, they could turn it to good account, butthis optimism seems to be contrary to the available evidence. The tract consists in the main of a tangle of limestone hills, which have lost practically all theirsoil as the result of thousands of years of erosion; a member of an archaeologicalexpedition, which was recently investigating town sites on the borders of theNegeb, described these hills as presenting &quot;a bare, piale aspect, such as one might expect to find in the moon &quot; and again as &quot; miles of rocky emptiness.&quot;There is no water in the tract; it has an average annual rainfall of less than inches, while much of it has less than 2 inches or, in other words, is practicallyrainless.66. Seeing, however, that the Jews claim that it can be developed, itspotentialities should be explored, but the attachment of it forthwith as an island appendage to the Jewish province would be open to objection. If this were done and if, as appears to be prima facie probable, investigation proved thetract to be valueless, no matter what warning might have been given in advance,world Jewry would inevitably voice the complaint that it had been misled by theoffer of a province two-thirds of which was desert and that it was entitled toreparation accordingly.67. It is therefore suggested that the Negeb should be retained, for thepresent at least, under the control of the High Commissioner. Experts, whosetechnical qualifications were as unquestionable as their probity and impartiality,should visit the Negeb and explore its potentialities. An announcement wouldsimultaneously be made that, should development prove to be possible, the Trusteewould be prepared to grant a lease of the area to a Jewish Company. The leasewould, of course, safeguard existing rights such as the oil prospecting licencesalready granted. Should, on the other hand, when the investigation was complete,the report of the experts be negative, the area could be left under the controlof the High Commissioner or, alternatively, be attached to the Arab province.It would be immaterial which course was adopted as, with the exception of ahandful of nomad Beduin, the tract is uninhabited.J. The Transitional Period.68. As soon as it was decided that the plan was to be introduced, steps would be taken to reorganise the Administration accordingly. A revisedAdministrative Divisions Proclamation would be issued, redistributing the districts into which the country is now divided so as to accord with the newboundaries. All records, tax-lists and the like would be sorted and transferredto offices in the area to which they related. Centrally held stores and plant wouldbe allocated between the provinces and the enclave, and customs posts would besited so that the statistical records necessary for the distribution of customs revenue could be inaugurated. The Jerusalem enclave would be at once estab-lished, the finances of the three areas would be separated and regulations wouldbe promulgated preventing residents in one area from taking up permanent residence in another without permission.69. While these and other necessary formalities, such as the preparation of electoral rolls and the like, were being completed, and thereafter until the two communities expressed their willingness to take over the duties of local govern-ment, the country would be administered by the Trustee as three entities under acommon control. It appears probable that this arrangement would, in any event,present advantages over the existing system of government. On looking at a map, nothing is more striking than the size of the areas in northern and centralPalestine in which there is hardly a single Jew and which are quite unsuitable for Jewish colonisation but which, owing to the fear of eventual Jewish penetration-tion, have been the seat of the most violent anti-Jewish outbreaks in the past.By relegating these areas to an enclosure in which Jews would be prohibited from either purchasing land or taking up residence, it should be possible to allaythis fear and to bring the population to give to their own local affairs precedenceover communal dissension.
70. The Trustee would administer this area on Arab lines and in Arabinterests; in the remainder of the country, excluding Jerusalem, administration would be carried on with a Jewish bias impossible under any unitary form ofgovernment. The present need of continually balancing the claims andsusceptibilities of one race against those of the other would largely disappear.It would be immaterial to the Trustee how long this regime persisted; the ultimateintention having been made known, the longer the scheme was operated underofficial auspices, the less complications would the transfer to popular controlinvolve. But it is probable that it would not be long before self-interest won theday and the whole scheme took the shape desired.K. -The Mandate.71. It is an advantage of the scheme that both the transitional and ultimatearrangements could be introduced within the terms of the existing Mandate.The opportunity afforded by the substitution for the Mandate of a new Trustee-ship Agreement would doubtless be taken to remove some of the ambiguities whichhave been brought to light in the former, but the process would be one ofclarification and not of material alteration in principle.L.-Probable Reactions to the Scheme Proposed.72. It is not, of course, suggested that a solution on the basis proposed wouldbe acceptable either to the Arabs or to the Jews, but this cannot be regarded asa conclusive argument against it, since it is equally true of any just and reasonable solution which could be propounded. The Zionists would protest vigorouslyagainst this or any plan which set a limit, other than the whole of Palestine, tothe growth of the National Home and particularly to one which excludedJerusalem from their sphere of control. The Arabs would resist the scheme asadmitting of the entry of further Jews and as denying to them what they claimto be their right, an independent Palestine under majority Arab rule. The arab and Jewish claims are utterly irreconcilable. No possible arrangement would-satisfy both : no equitable arrangement would satisfy either. The question isnot, therefore, whether the scheme would be acceptable to Arabs or Jews but whether it is one which affords to the Trustee a practical means of dischargingthe undertakings given to the two communities to such an extent that it wouldbe accepted, by the world in general as a reasonable compromise between theirconflicting claims. It would seem that it might well be so accepted; at least itscritics would have difficulty in suggesting a better or more equitable solution.Were it so accepted, it is doubtful whether either race would be so ill-advisedas to hold out indefinitely against it or to promote disorders in Palestine in the face of world opinion.78. Under the scheme, the Jews would undoubtedly be much better off thanthey are at present. Immigration could be regulated solely with relation to its-economic effects and without reference to political repercussions; the area inwhich Jews would be free to acquire land would be greatly extended; and thecontrol of the subjects most pertinent to the development of the National Homewould be entrusted to them by statute. The Arabs would gain in that three-quarters of them would be freed, once and for all, from any fear of Jewishdomination; the great majority of these would achieve at once a semi-autonomousstatus, with prospects of full ultimate autonomy. Powerful safeguards wouldbe provided to protect the rights of the remaining quarter. It would be difficultto argue that, were a scheme of this nature promulgated, the utmost that washumanly possible had not been done to reconcile the interests of both parties.
