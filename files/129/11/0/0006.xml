THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1946.SECRET. Copy No.   38CP. (46) 256.ith July, 1946.CABINET.UNITED NATIONS ORGANISATION.United Kingdom Representation on the Economic and Social Council.Note by the Prime Minister.I have had under consideration our representation on the Economic and social Council of U.N.O. It is clear that, in view of the range of activities withwhich it deals, no single Minister can adequately represent this country. Therewill have to be a team chosen for each particular Conference. The Minister ofState, as the permanent representative, will always be a member of the team andwill provide the element of continuity. It is, however, my intention that other ministers should also attend when the Agenda includes matters of importance which affect the work of their Departments; and that, when those matters arebeing considered, they should lead the discussion on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,UK July, 1946.[32079]
