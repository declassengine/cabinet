600e(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (46)  26612TH JULY,   194-united STATES DOLLAR expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Cabinet,  on 8th July, agreed that  there should bea general review of departmental import programmesj under thedirection of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Planning,immediately a decision had been reached on the United Statesloan.2.      Such a general review cannot be carried out in anydetail within a few days.      But assuming that the loanis passed by Congress, we must be in a position to announcecertain decisions on Monday afternoon.      A meeting ofMinisters concerned was therefore held this afternoon underthe Chairmanship of the Lord President aad I was authorisedto report  the results of our discussions to the Cabinet.3,      In April last the Cabinet agreed on a provisional import programme for the twelve months to mid-194-7 on the assumptionthat  the loan went through.      Reviewing the position today,my recommendation to my colleagues is that we could affordseme further small increase in dollar expenditure in orderto make possible some additional easement.4.      In making this proposal we have been influenced by thesuccess of the export programme which has gone better than weanticipated.      But too much reliance must not be placed onthis,  since the President of the Board of Trade has warnedus that there are signs that we shall meet with many difficulties in raising the level of exports above thatreached in May.5.      Looking at  the position as a whole, my colleagues andI feel that food, particularly fruit and other variety foods,has a first claim.      The Minister ef Pood would like authorityto seek to purchase additional foods costing $40 million in all.      This figure is mainly made up of fruits.The Minister told us that it was unlikely that he would infact be able to purchase anything like the full additional-programme now proposed, and that  there would almost certainlybb a shortfall on his existing basic and supplementaryprogrammes,COPY NO.CABINET

6,      We also agreed that an additional $25 millions shouldhe spent on tobacco for stockbuildingj      This does not involve increased consumption but is a protection againsta bad crop in 1947 and an increase dn United Statespr ices.7.      The President of the Board of Trade would also likeauthority to expend up to an additional $10 millions onraw materials and machinery.      This would enable him to alleviate somewhat the stringency of these programmes.8.      On petrol the general view of ray colleagues was against abolishing rationing.      But we decided torecommend to the Cabinet an increase of 50^ in the basicration,  together with some increase in supplementary allowances in order to prevent anomalies.      This isestimated to cost $15 millions.      There may,  of course,be consequential claims to relax rationing in Autraliaand New Zealand.9.      I attach a table showing the import programme, withthe above additions, from the United States dollar area in the year to mid-1947 (Annex A).I also attach a draft statement which it is proposedthat I should make in the House of Commons on Monday afternoon (Annex B).H.D.Treasury, S.W.1.12TH JULY,   1946.

ANNEX A.The following table shows the estimated importsfrom the United States dollar area of products includedin the import programme for the year mid-1946 to mid-1947,provisionally agreed by the Cabinet in April on theassumption that the loan went through,  and the proposedadditions thereto.I.

It is unlikely that supplies will be available tothis extent.      There willalso probably beshortfalls on the basicand supplementary foodpr ogrammes.For stock building.

6GANNEX draft statement the House will, I am sure,  share the satisfaction ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government that the United States Congresshas approved the Loan Agreement.If the Loan had not he en forthcoming we shouldhave had to face a serious increase in the austerity whichwe have endured so long.      But now,  though we shall still have to do without many imports which we should he very glad to have, we can confirm the plans we have already made for some much needed expansion of supplies fromah road.This will permit my Right Hon. Friend the Minister ofFood to provide us with a more varied diet.      We shall also arrange for more plentiful supplies of raw materials and a limited increase in imports of manufactured goods.My Right Hon, Friend the Minister of Fuel and Power willmake a statement on petrol in the course of a few days.We must keep a balance between the various demands, since we cannot yet afford to buy all we should like.To use a famous phrase, the Loan must be, for us,not a sofa but a springboard.     We cannot relax our efforts in production, especially in the export trades.     Assoon as we can, we must balance our overseas account.The value of the Loan is that it gives us a breathing space and new reserves of strength to accomplish this task.For this we thank the United States, believing that they and we have a common interest in revivingtrade throughout the -world, and providing good standards of living for men and women everywhere,
