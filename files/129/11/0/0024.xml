THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&quot;Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1946.SECRET.CP. (46) 274.lQth July, 1946.CABINET.OVERSEAS ECONOMIC AND PUBLICITY PROBLEMS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State eor Foreign Affairs.IN CP. (46) 215 the Lord President offers a number of interesting observa-tions about overseas economic and publicity problems based on his recent mission to the United States and Canada. I should like to make a few comments on hisreferences to international machinery in economic matters, to the co-ordinationof economic work on the British side in Washington, to staffing problems, andto the conduct in public relations work in the United States.2. The Lord President rightly observes that the present condition ofinternational machinery for dealing with economic and supply questions is ina transitional phase. The Combined Boards which dealt with such questions on an Anglo-American or Anglo-American-Canadian basis during the war have in some cases disappeared and in other cases have become internationalisedthrough force of circumstances. The urge to internationalise the Combined food board, as well as the various Anglo-American commodity committees which havetaken the place of the Combined Raw Materials Board and the Combined Pro-duction and Resources Board, has come largely from the American side, andit has constantly been pointed out to the Americans by our representatives in washington that the substitution of an international body for a closely integratedwartime machine will inevitably result in some temporary loss of efficiency. Thisis the interregnum through which we are now passing, but I have every confidence that, in so far as the matter is in our hands, the new machinery will get rapidlyinto its stride. The United Kingdom representatives on the Washington Com-mittees for coal and textiles (the latter being one of the most important incentivegoods) are of high calibre and are members of the Embassy staff responsible tothe Minister (Commercial). The United Kingdom has already made a contri-bution to the Secretariat of the International Emergency Food Council and(in a rather different field) there has for long been close co-operation betweenU.N.R.R.A. and the Emergency Economic Committee for Europe, between that committee and the European Coal Organisation and between the E.C.O. andthe European Central Inland Transport Organisation. The whole question ofthe relationship of these regional bodies with the United Nations is also under active consideration. I agree nevertheless that it would be appropriate for the steering Committee for International Organisations to review the whole position.3. I understand that the suggestions in the third paragraph of the lord presidents paper are being examined by the Overseas Information services committee; and would confine myself to pointing out that in practice it has proved extraordinarily difficult to present the activities of international economicbodies in a way which is likely to interest the general public.4. The transition from war to peace has naturally brought about greatchanges in the nature of the organisation of British representation in washington. The contraction of the various departmental missions and the closing of the Civil Secretariat was carefully planned in Washington and fully considered and agreed by the departments concerned in London. I have beenkeeping the whole position under constant review with particular reference tothe relationship of the Embassy to the departmental missions, and I asked LordInverchapel before he left to let me have an early report on this question. Ithink that my colleagues would be interested to read the attached report whichhe has prepared (see Appendix) which seems to me to give a clear picture of the13435   [32145] copy No. ^
present organisation. I am satisfied that this is developing on the right lines and that it would be inadvisable to accelerate the rate at which separate depart-mental representation is absorbed into the Embassy. In practice everythingdepends on a satisfactory working relationship between the Ambassador and his staff and the various departmental mission and United Kingdom elements ofinternational organisations situated in Washington. I am glad to say that thisrelationship has been close and continuous, and in order to adapt it to changing circumstances and to ensure that all British representatives and officials in washington concerned with economic and financial matters are kept fully informed on policy questions in the future, as they have been in the past throughthe wartime machinery, the Ambassador has very recently decided to set up asmall committee under his chairmanship. The membership of this committeewill include the Economic Minister, the Financial Minister, the ExecutiveDirector of the Bank, and his alternate, the Executive Director of the Fund andhis alternate, the Head of the Food Mission, the Head of the Supply Office, theHead of the Shipping Mission, the Commercial Counsellor, and others ad hoc.A Secretariat will be provided by the economic side of the Embassy and by theTreasury Delegation.5. On the question of staff as opposed to organisation it is, of course, truethat in recent months our representation in Washington has been greatly reduced and that there have been many changes in personnel. With the change-over froma war to a peace-time basis drastic cuts in the total numbers of British officials in Washington were both necessary and desirable. I agree with the lord president that this process should not go too far or too fast, but I think that lord InverchapeFs memorandum shows that the reorganisation is being effected in an orderly manner and with due regard to the need for co-ordination and economy. I hope that the other Departments who still need to maintain repre-sentatives in Washington will see to it that the quality of those who remain isof a high order.6. While the Missions have been rapidly dwindling in the course of the lastyear the Embassy itself has remained relatively constant in numbers and somedepartments of it have actually expanded to meet increased responsibilities. Ithas not always been possible to fill vacancies as quickly as we would have wished,owing to competing demands elsewhere, but reinforcements for both the Economicand Political sides of the Embassy have recently been sent or are now on their way.7. On the Information side I fully recognise the importance of taking advantage of the present atmosphere to drive home our case not only in thepolitical but also in the economic field. At the time of the Lord Presidentsvisit the Information staff was unfortunately very thin. The new head of theBritish Information Services had not arrived, his deputy was ill and another important member of the staff was in England. Even so, the notoriousMacDermott incident was due to shortage and absence of staff on the Americanside rather than to any deficiency on our side. Thanks to the President of theBoard of Trade, I have, since that date, been able to put Mr. W. P. N. Edwards,whose experience as Information Officer to the Supply Council in washington and to the Ministry of Production makes him peculiarly well fitted to deal witheconomic publicity, in charge of the British Information Services, andMr. Philip Jordan has been appointed to strengthen the Washington staff. Thestanding of the British Information Services in America is high, and I am satisfied that with the recent appointments it is adequately staffed to carryout its task within the budgetary limitations which our present situation compelsus to accept.8. I would like to add that I entirely agree with the Lord Presidentscomments about the importance of adequate arrangements for the accommoda-tion and transport of Government Representatives on Missions overseas. Somestrengthening of the administration and facilities side of our Embassy atWashington to deal with such matters is necessary, and I am now awaitingLord InverchapeFs recommendations on this point. I hope I can count on thesupport of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in making the necessary financial provision for effecting improvements in this direction.E.

APPENDIX.Organisation of British Representation in Washington.Report by Lord Inverchapel.1. By the 30th June the reorganisation of the United Kingdom representa-tion in Washington will have made great progress in the direction of the progressive liquidation of separate missions and the reintegration of their functions into the Embassy.A.-Mdssions outside the Embassy.2. On the 30th June there will remain outside the specific jurisdiction ofthe Embassy only the Joint Staff Mission, the Supply Office, the Food Mission, theShipping Mission and the Colonies Supply Mission. Of these, the ColoniesSupply Mission is already absorbed in the Supply Office and is due to disappearin September, and the Shipping Mission will soon be ripe for transformation into1an office of a Shipping Attache to the Embassy with some residual duties in.connexion with wartime operations.3. Joint Staff Mission. The relationship with the Embassy, which isconsulted on all political matters, is entirely satisfactory and no change is recommended so long as the Combined Chiefs of Staff continue in existence.4. Supply Office.-ifThis amalgamates the procurement functions which usedto be performed by the War Office, Admiralty, Air Ministry, Ministry of Supplyand Ministry of Aircraft Production Missions in Washington. It will also absorb the procurement functions (other than food) of the Colonies Supply Mission. Itsparent department is the Ministry of Supply and Aircraft Production. Its mainfunction is to purchase commodities which His Majesty&apos;s Government buy in theUnited States on Government account (e.g., cotton, steel, aircraft parts). It alsohandles sales on Government account (e.g., surplus property). It has two-subsidiary functions : (a) to wind up wartime accounting; (b) to give a home tocertain officials who are exchanging technical information of quasi-militaryinterest with the United States departments. It was created on a temporary basis and its work is to be reviewed before the end of this year. It is non-political,and it is not organically connected with the Embassy. But its head, Mr. Hindley,looks to the Ambassador for any political guidance or assistance which he may require. I regard this relationship as satisfactory, and recommend that it shouldbe maintained until the future of the Office is determined. This will depend in large measure on the degree to which His Majesty&apos;s Government intend tocontinue government purchase in the United States of America. At the moment the Office can be expanded or contracted according to the policy which it is decidedto follow.5. Food Mission. This is the only Mission which is operating almost on itswar-time footing. Its function was primarily procurement of food-stuffs andthe operation of the Combined Food Board machinery. But owing to the world food crisis, its work has recently had a strong political complexion. It has no-organic connexion with the Embassy, but works very closely with it on an informal basis, and the Head of the Mission looks to the Ambassador for guidance on political matters. The objective in the case of the Food Mission, as in otherMissions, should be to reduce the establishment and to bring it to an end as aseparate organisation as soon as possible. The precedent of the dissolution ofthe Raw Materials Mission could be conveniently followed (see paragraph below). The procurement functions and personnel of the Food Mission would thenbe transferred to the Supply Office, whilst the political functions of the food mission, including relations with the Food and Agricultural Organisation andthe International Emergency Food Council would be transferred to a representa-tive of the Ministry of Food in the Embassy with an appropriate designation(e.g., &quot; Attache for Food Questions &quot;). I do not recommend setting a date for this change at present. I should rather wait two or three months, by which time itshould become possible to discern the broad outlines of the food problem as itwill develop in 1946-1947, and also the prospects for the successful functioning of the International Emergency Food Council. If this Council works well, the strain on the Food Mission should be considerably reduced.[32145] b 2
B. Missions organically connected with the Embassy but physically situatedoutside it.6. Treasury Delegation. The Head of the Treasury Delegation holds theposition of Minister (Financial) on my staff. The members of his staff, however,are not on the diplomatic list. The Delegation has its own offices in Washington.This is necessary partly in view of shortage of space in the Embassy, but also because the Treasury representative has to provide accommodation when needed for the United Kingdom representatives on the International Bank and Bund,and to act as a channel of communication between them and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. It appears to be a sound practical arrangement and I do not recommend any change for the present.7. United Kingdom. Scientific Mission. This Mission, which was originallyunder the Supply Council, has now become organically connected with the Embassyby the appointment of the Head of the Mission, Dr. Alexander King, as Attacheon Scientific Questions. The Mission has its offices in the British CommonwealthScientific Office, which consists of the scientific missions and representatives ofthe Dominions, and which is run as a unit. The other members of the UnitedKingdom Mission are not on the diplomatic list. The British CommonwealthScientific Office is an excellent institution which has fully justified its creation.I consider the relationship with the Embassy to be satisfactory and I do not recommend any change at present.8. Raw Materials Section. On the dissolution of the Raw MaterialsMission, its political functions were transferred to the Embassy and its procure-ment functions to the Supply Office. The Raw Materials Section is part of theEconomic side of the Embassy, into which it will move physically on the 1st July.It consists of an Assistant Secretary of the Board of Trade who has the localrank of Counsellor on my staff, four Principals who have the local rank ofEirst Secretary, and appropriate clerical assistance. It is possible that withina year the personnel can be halved. The officers of the Raw Materials Sectionstaff the United Kingdom side of the Combined Committees which are still inoperation on commodities such as hides and rubber. In addition to the oldCombined Raw Materials Board Committees there exist two committees of theeld Combined Production and Resources Board. These deal with coal and textiles and the British representation is effected by specialists appointed by the Ministryof Fuel and Power and the Board of Trade respectively who work in close contact with members of my staff. All of these committees are destined to dissolve butthey still serve a useful purpose. Our representation on them is necessary, small,and efficient.9. Combined Unit for Statistical and Economic Information. -This organi-sation was set up as the result of an exchange of correspondence between theSecretary of Commerce and the President of the Board of Trade. It is a pro-jection into the post-war period of the combined statistical and economic servicesperformed by the Combined Production and Resources Board. It is housed witha section of the United States Department of Commerce, but the United Kingdommembers of the staff are administratively under the Embassy. The unit in itsnew form has not existed very long. Its organisation appears to me to be satis-factory, but the question of the number and grades of United Kingdom staff whichwill ultimately be required is under review. It may be possible to reduce thepresent staff somewhat in the next few months.C. Organisation Inside the Embassy.10. The following Departments are represented by Attaches or SpecialRepresentatives who are housed in the Embassy : -The Ministry of Fuel and Power (for Petroleum questions).The Ministry of Agriculture.The Ministry of Labour.The Ministry of Health.The Ministry of Civil Aviation.In addition, there is a Telecommunications Attache, appointed in consultationwith the General Post Office, who reports to the Foreign Office. These areAttaches who stand in the same relation to myself as the Service Attaches,except that they normally deal in the first instance with the EconomicMinister.     They   communicate   direct   with   their   respective   departments
through Foreign Office channels. Board of Trade interests are represented by three sections, one devoted to general commercial policy questions, theTrade Promotion Section and the Raw Materials Section (paragraph 8 above).Each section is headed by a Counsellor, two of them being Foreign service officers (late Commercial Diplomatic Service). The departmental representa-:tion varies in size and in the seniority of the representative. For example,the Ministry of Health has a single representative of senior rank. The CivilAviation Department is at present represented by a comparatively young man,who has a staff of three.11. The organisation is flexible and appears to me to be sound. The repre-sentation of any Department could be increased rapidly and, if necessary,developed once more into a separate Mission. The general organisation of the embassy on the economic side is illustrated by the attached chart.D.^ ^General.12. Economy. A separate section of the Treasury Delegation supervises in washington the reduction of staffs of the Missions with the object of achieving the maximum degree of economy. I understand that progress is satisfactory,and that the numbers of British officials employed in the United States and thenumber of buildings which are occupied by them in Washington are beingrapidly reduced. As far as the Embassy is concerned, any activity which istransferred to the Embassy and comes on the Foreign Office vote is very carefullyscrutinised to make sure that the staff is at the minimum level to ensure efficientoperation. For example, in the case of the United Kingdom staff of the CombinedEconomic and Statistical Section, the staff numbers, inherited from the british staff of the Combined Production and Resources Board, have been considerably reduced., and may be further reduced when the scope of useful work to be cloneby the section has been more clearly defined.13. Recommendations: -I find that the present organisation and proposed changes of the British representation in Washington correspond broadly to the objectives which you set before me. I do not propose any immediate changes,and the only major reorganisation which it might be necessary to contemplatein the near future concerns the Food Mission (paragraph 5 above). For the rest,I would suggest that the present organisation, which in some of its aspects hasbeen modified comparatively recently, or is now in the process of modification inthe desired direction, should be maintained, and that I should report to youagain, say on the 1st Januaiy next, on the manner in which it is working and what changes may then be required.14. Accommodation. If the objective is, as I am sure it should be, to bring-eventually all the activities of British representatives in Washington into onegroup of buildings, further space will be needed. I do not foresee that ourrepresentation in Washington in the future will contract to the point at whichit can be accommodated in our present offices, and if at any time the combined chiefs of Staff organisation came to an end there would be a heavy demand onour available space. It was for these reasons that my predecessor put forward the suggestion that a piece of land adjoining the Embassy property onMassachusetts Avenue should be immediately procured. I am addressing youseparately on this subject.British Embassy, Washington, D.C.,19* A June, 1946.
