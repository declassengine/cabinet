^1    .F .:.c-ih&quot;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT sjPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1946.25SECRET. Copy No.    3 8CP. (46) 258.8th July, 1946.CABINET.REPORT OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRYREGARDING THE PROBLEMS OF EUROPEAN JEWRY and palestine.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN this memorandum I summarise the recommendations of the Anglo-American Committee and point out some of their implications and of thedifficulties foreseen in giving effect to them.Recommendation No. 1.Resettlement of displaced persons.2. The Anglo-American Committee dealt with this part of their terms ofreference in an entirely inadequate manner. Their recommendations are con-fined to suggesting that the United Kingdom and United States governments should endeavour immediately to find new homes for &apos;&apos; Displaced Persons &apos;&apos; andto secure that effect is given to the provision of the United Nations Charter inregard to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Neither these recommendations, nor the Committee&apos;s examination of the general problem in chapter II of their report, appear likely to result in any positive advance towards &quot; remedial action in the European countries in question &quot;or &quot; theprovision of facilities for immigration to and settlement in countries outside europe.&quot;3. The question of the resettlement of refugees generally has been under con-sideration by the Special Refugees Committee of the United Nations whose report,after consideration by the Economic and Social Council, will have to be referredto Member Governments and submitted to the General Assembly next September,so that no effective action can be expected before the autumn.4. It will of course be recognised that Arab opposition to the immigration of100,000 Jews into Palestine (Recommendation No. 2 below) would be even keenershould this movement begin in advance of any plan for the resettlement in othercountries of the remainder of the displaced persons in Europe.&quot;Recommendation No. 2.Grant of 100,000 immigration certificates to Jews and their early admissioninto Palestine.5. The technical and financial implications of this recommendation were examined during the recent conversations between delegations of British and american officials in London. No account was taken of political or military implications nor of economic factors extending beyond the near future.6. The American delegation were inclined to accept the estimate of theJewish Agency that the 100,000 immigrants could be transported to and settled in Palestine at the rate of 10,000 a month. The British delegation consideredthat, having regard to the existing serious housing congestion in Palestine andthe shortage of building labour, it would be impracticable to arrange for the accommodation and absorption of more than an average of 4,000 a month, withan average stay in a staging camp of 2\ months. In this case, the operation would[32092] .3
cover two years. The admission of 100,000 immigrants at this rate would not, itwas agreed, occasion any immediate unemployment. The British delegationconsidered, however, that very special measures, involving large capital expendi-ture, would be necessary if unemployment was to be averted when more normalconditions are restored and Palestine industry and agriculture, which are stillorganised largely on a war-time basis, have to face-competitive imports.7. It would be necessary to import from a source other than the UnitedKingdom practically ail the material required for the construction of dwellingsand ancillary buildings for the immigrants. It would further be necessary to import the additional food supplies which would be necessitated by this increasein the population of Palestine.8. The direct cost of giving effect to this Recommendation (apart from any military expenditure required), as estimated by the British delegation, would beof the order of  100 million, excluding the cost of transport which the UnitedStates Government has offered to meet. The Jewish Agency&apos;s estimate of thecost is from:  53 million to  63 million. The United States delegation suggested,on the assurance of the Jewish Agency, that the financial responsibility could beundertaken by the Agency. It is doubtful, however, whether in practice that bodycould give any adequate guarantee that the full cost of the scheme would be met by them. Nor does it seem administratively practicable to devise in advancemeans of ensuring that employment for the 100,000 (or for existing Palestinianresidents displaced by them) would, in fact, be available when the time camewithout recourse to Government assistance and finance. The indirect cost of the immigration, arising out of the inevitable stimulus to inflation and the need for reinforcing the internal security forces (other than the Army) would certainly fallon the Palestine budget and might be of the order of  10 million a year.Recommendations Nos. 3 and 4.Principles of Government.9. The Committee regarded it as essential that a clear statement of thefollowing principles should be made : (1) that Jew shall not dominate Arab orArab Jew; (2) that Palestine shall be neither a Jewish nor an Arab State: and(3) that the form of government ultimately established shall, under InternationalGuarantees, fully protect and preserve the interests of Christendom and of the moslem and Jewish faiths. The Committee have, however, made no attempt to face up to the difficulties of framing a type of constitution which will secure these ends. The only specific suggestions made are that an Arab communalorganisation might be formed on the lines of the Jewish communal organisation to supervise Arab social and educational services; and that local administrativeareas might be formed, some purely Arab or Jewish in composition, but some ofmixed population where a corporate sense of civic responsibility could be encouraged and a new beginning made in the development of self-government.Meanwhile, &quot; the Government of Palestine is to be continued as at present underMandate pending the execution of a trusteeship agreement under the united nations.&quot; The Committee&apos;s recommendations thus .afford no prospect of thedevelopment of self-governing institutions at the centre, since there is no reasonto suppose that under a continuance of a mandatory or &quot; trusteeship &quot; regimemere passage of time would make it any easier for the Arabs and Jews toco-operate in working a democratic form of constitution. Moreover, it is opento serious doubt whether the conditions thus visualised by the Committee are consistent with Article 76 of the Charter of the United Nations organisation which lays down, as one of the basic objectives of the trusteeship system, thedevelopment towards self-government or independence of the inhabitants of the trust Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the peopleconcerned.Recommendations Nos. 5, 8 ano 9.Social and Economic Development.10. In these three Recommendations, the Committee advocate action underthe following heads : (a) Measures to raise the Arab standard of living to that of the Jews, withparticular regard to social services, including hospitals.(b) Reform of the education system of both Jews and Arabs, including theintroduction of compulsory education within a reasonable time.
(c) Examination, discussion and execution of certain large-scale development plans in consultation and co-operation with the Jewish Agency andthe Governments of the neighbouring Arab States directly affected.[d) The schemes under (c) above to be conceived as public projects and under-taken by Government and not by any private organisation.11. The measures comprised under (a) and (b) above do not raise any newquestion of principle : they are desirable in themselves and effect would have beengiven to them in the past but for their financial implications. In view of the pre-dominant importance placed by the Arabs on the political implications of theReport, it may safely be said that these economic and cultural measures would fail completely to provide a counterbalance to the rejection of the Arabpolitical claims, as the Committee evidently intended. The capital cost of proceeding now with the promotion of social services to the standard visualisedby the Committee would be  15 million for Arab services alone; and, since itwould be unrealistic to assume that this expansion of Arab services could beeffected without a corresponding improvement in Jewish services, an additional sum of the order of  5 million would be required on this account. The relevantrecurrent expenditure would rise from approximately  1 million in the first yearto over  3 million in respect of Arab services and to  1 million in respect of jewish services when the projects were completed.12. Concurrently with the expansion of social services contemplated, itwould be necessary, in order to give effect to the recommendation, to introduce aseries of economic and sociological measures designed to promote permanentadvancement of the Arab standard of living. These would include such projects asagrarian reorganisation, improvement of land utilisation, the promotion of lightindustries, the provision of credit facilities, the extension of labour organisa-tions, acceleration of activities directed to the promotion of the co-operative movement, housing and town-planning, and the improvement of water supplies..While detailed schemes have not been formulated, provisional estimates showthat the expenditure to be envisaged would be of the order of  30 million capital and  1 million recurrent.13. As regards the large-scale development projects covered by (c) and (d),above, it is clear that, unless and until the political situation improves, not onlywill it be impossible to interest the Palestinian Arabs in large-scale development,schemes, which they will regard solely as devices to enable further Jewish,immigrants to enter Palestine, but in view of the situation of some of the works and of their vulnerability to interference or sabotage the practicability of constructing and maintaining such schemes will be in doubt. There is no chanceof obtaining the willing co-operation of adjacent Arab States in the execution ofsuch projects, since the Arab League has categorically announced on behalf of theStates Members of the League that they will not co-operate in any development scheme designed to make more land available for Jewish immigration unless.Palestine is first declared to be an Arab State.14. The financial implications of these projects are formidable. preliminary examination of the main large-scale project presented to the Committee, thatfor an irrigation and hydro-electric scheme from the Jordan Valley, raises doubt as to the validity of certain of the assumptions on which it is based, and it is open to question whether, even presuming it to be feasible, the cost ( 76 million),has not been seriously underestimated and the gross revenue ( 7 million) equallyseriously overestimated.15. The Committee contemplated the possibility of some arrangement, in the:execution of such large-scale projects, which would combine Jewish finance with government responsibility and control. This possibilitv depends primarily onthe extent to which the Jews, both in Palestine and elsewhere, would be preparedto co-operate in the development of the country in the interests of the populationas a whole. At present there is scanty recognition of this principle, and ingeneral Jewish funds are devoted wholly to Jewish development, although insome cases there may be some incidental benefit to the Arab community.Recommendation No. 6.Future Immigration and the Control of Illegal Immigration.16.   It is proposed by the Committee that immigration should continue afterthe admission of the 100,000 immigrants specified in Recommendation No. 2 and[32092] b 2
that Arab acquiescence in it should not be required. While declaring that theproper development of the National Home must involve immigration, the Com-mittee repudiated the Zionist principle that every Jew can enter Palestine as of right, merely because he is a Jew. The Committee concluded that the Governmentof Palestine should determine the number of immigrants to be admitted to palestine, the governing consideration being the well-being of all the people ofPalestine, be they Jews, Arabs or neither.17. The Committee&apos;s recommendation thus leaves unsolved the most crucial question affecting the administration of Palestine, viz., the character and measureof future immigration. Of all their recommendations, No. 6 will meet with themost obdurate and sustained opposition on the part of the Palestine Arabs. Noris it to be expected that the Jews will acquiesce in a formula which is in directopposition to their claims regarding the free admission of Jews to Palestinewhich they regard, however erroneously, as deriving direct from the balfour declaration, and which are embodied in the Biltmore Resolutions. An immigra-tion policy based on the broad lines sketched by the Committee would appearto imply reversion to the old problem of economic absorptive capacity with all its vexatious uncertainties. On the other hand, it may well be argued that to exclude political considerations when assessing &apos;&apos; the well-being of all the peopleof Palestine &quot; is to make nonsense of the phrase. In short, the Committee&apos;recommendation gives no definite lead for future policy; it leaves the situation as indefinite and as unsatisfactory as it is to-day.18. The Committee offer no solution to the problem of illegal immigration,which in this context is to be taken as implying organized mass immigration in defiance of the law, beyond expressing the view that the Jewish Agency should atonce resume active co-operation with the Mandatory in the suppression of the traffic. A request for such co-operation might be temporarily effective if the100,000 immigrants were admitted, since their absorption would tax all theresources of the Agency, but it would certainly cease to be effective thereafter. the agency have repeatedly refused to support the Government in any measures whichare designed to deprive any Jew of the opportunity of reaching Palestine andare most unlikely to recede from this attitude.Recommendation No. 7.Policy with regard to Land.19. With the possible exception of those relating to immigration, none of theCommittee&apos;s recommendations is likely to cause more intense indignation amongthe Arabs than that for the repeal of the Land Transfer Regulations of 1940.These Regulations were never intended to be a political measure; they werepromulgated to secure that Arab cultivators in certain areas could maintain theirexisting standard of life and to prevent the emergence of a large landless arab population. The latest estimates show that the average area cultivated by an arab family is only about two-thirds of a reasonable subsistence area. TheCommittee recommended that the Regulations should be rescinded and replaced by regulations based on a policy of freedom in the sale, lease or use of land,irrespective of race, community or creed, and providing adequate protection forthe interests of small owners and tenant cultivators. They made no suggestion as to the lines on which such regulations might be framed.20. The question of protecting small owners and tenant cultivators hasreceived much attention from the Government of Palestine during the past tenyears, but, apart from the Land Transfer Regulations, no solution has been evolved. Legislation for the protection of tenant cultivators is already in existencebut its operation has proved most unsatisfactory; not only has it tended to retarddevelopment of the land but it has provided tenants with a powerful instrument for the exploitation of landlords. The modification of this legislation, which has proved to be a thoroughly unsuccessful measure since its enactment, is now underconsideration.21. Proposals for the protection of small land owners have also been muchdiscussed and legislation to this end has in fact been drafted. It has never been enacted, however, since it is considered that the practical difficulties in giving effect to it, arising out of the extreme complexity of land holdings in Palestine andthe determination of alternative means of subsistence available to propectivesellers, would be insuperable.
22. The real problem is not so much to maintain the position of individuals asto find means of preventing the alienation of further Arab land in areas alreadycongested. This is the effect of the Land Transfers Regulations and no othersolution of the problem, except possibly at the great expense which would beentailed by the acquisition and control of all land by the Government, appearsto be practicable.Recommendation No. 10.Maintenance of Law and Order.23. This recommendation is to the effect that, if the Committee&apos;s report is adopted, it should be made clear to both Arabs and Jews that any attempt toprevent its execution will be resolutely suppressed. The Committee furtherexpressed the view that the Jewish Agency should &apos;&apos; at once resume active co-operation with the Mandatory in the suppression of terrorism and of illegal immigration, and in the maintenance of law and order.&apos;&apos;24. Since the publication of the Committee&apos;s report, Arab feeling against ithas progressively hardened and its acceptance may be expected to lead to an Arabrising in Palestine. As regards the Jewish attitude, the Jewish Agency prefacedtheir reply to the request of His Majesty&apos;s Government for their views on thereport with the statement that the only just and lasting solution of the palestine problem was the establishment of Palestine as a Jewish State. They went on tosay that, after what they termed &quot;the primary recommendation of theCommittee&apos;&apos; for the immediate admission of 100,000 immigrants had been implemented in good faith, they would be prepared to discuss with the twoGovernments any matters arising out of the other recommendations. In other words, they appear to have rejected one recommendation, accepted one, and reserved their position as regards the remainder. It is unlikely that, even giventhe admission of 100,000 immigrants, the Jewish community in general wouldforgo its claim for a Jewish State, and terrorism, possibly with large-scale actionon the part of the illegal Hagana, would continue unabated.General Considerations.(A) Strategic.25. From the political point of view, it is the unanimous view of HisMajesty&apos;s Representatives that the adoption of the policy recommended by theAnglo-American Committee would have disastrous effects on Great Britain&apos;position in the Middle East and might have unfortunate repercussions in India.Both the immediate and long-term reactions of the Arab States would be extremelyunfavourable : acceptance of the report would undermine belief in the good faithof Great Britain and in the benefits to be obtained from friendship with thiscountry and thus make the Arab peoples more easily accessible to Russianpropaganda and influence. Following the recent conference of the Arab league council at Bludan in Syria, the Arab Governments have urged the conclusion,before the meeting of the General Assembly of U.N.O. in September, of anagreement between His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Arab Governmentsterminating the Palestine Mandate and putting Palestine in a situationconforming with the United Nations Charter, Pending the outcome of this approach, the Governments of the Arab States may be expected to do what theycan to restrain the violent expression of Arab sentiment in regard to Palestine.If, however, the Committee&apos;s report were adopted, there would almost inevitably be&apos; disturbances throughout the Arab countries, possibly with co-ordinatedand certainly with unco-ordinated attacks against British as well as Jewishpersons and property.26. The military implications of giving effect to the Committee&apos;s report,including the suppression of private armies and general disarmament through-out Palestine, have been assessed by the Chiefs of Staff. They calculate that,to meet the additional commitments which would thereby be imposed, theexisting forces in the Middle East would have to be reinforced by two infantry divisions (one on the spot and the other at short call), an armoured brigade andthree infantry battalions, together with some reinforcement to the naval andair forces. While the additional naval and air forces might be found fromBritish resources at some expense to commitments and contingencies in other areas, the necessary army reinforcements could not be found by the UnitedKingdom save at the expense of withdrawing from other commitments fromwhich, in fact, withdrawal is not possible.
(B) Recapitulation of financial implications of giving effect to the Committee&apos;report.Capital. Recurrent.27.   A.   Direct cost.                                        Recommendation No. 2   ......     100,000,000Recommendations Nos. 5, 8 and 9: Arab Social Services         ...      15,000,000 1- 3,000,000Economic measures......      30,000,000 1,000,000145,000,000 2- 4,000,000B. Indirect cost.Jewish Social Services . ... 5,000,000 1,000,000Expenditure arising out  of increased inflation...      ... ...                  7,000,000Expenditure on law and order;loss of revenue     ...... ...              3- 8,000,0005,000,000      11-16,000,000Aggregate of A and B    ...      ...     150,000,000      13-20,000,000The above figures do not take into account the cost of the major develop-ment projects which the Committee desire to see constructed. The Jordan ValleyScheme, the only one so far examined, is estimated to cost  76 million, and this,as already mentioned, is believed to be an underestimate.28. A considerable proportion of this expenditure is expenditure for whichthe Jewish Agency have declared their willingness to accept responsibility. Butthere is no guarantee of their ability to do so; it will depend largely on thesuccess of future charitable appeals. Any amount which they fail to find, aswell as the whole cost of the remainder of the measures, will have to be foundeither by the Palestine Government or by His Majesty&apos;s Government. The con-tribution which the former will be able to make will inevitably be small; the finding of the balance would impose an unjustifiable and intolerable burden onHis Majesty&apos;s Government.Summary.29. To sum up, the implementation of the Committee&apos;s recommendations infull seems likely, by estranging the Arab States, to imperil our position in. theMiddle East and at the same time to involve us in military and financial commit-ments beyond our capacity to bear. On the other hand, such implementation wouldprovide no solution of the Palestine problem since no long-term policy is suggested and no proposals are offered for the final determination of the major issues of immigration and land sales. Our position as Mandatory would certainly be noeasier after such implementation than it is to-da)?:30. As I consider that the recommendations of the Anglo-American Com-mittee, taken as a whole, are unworkable, I have in a separate paper put forward for consideration an alternative proposal for long-term policy in Palestine.G.
