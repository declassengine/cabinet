(46) 38980th July.  1946CABINETCANADIAN WHEAT SUPPLIESNote by the Additional secretary i circulate for consideration by the Cabinet a revised draft public statement by the Minister of Pood.Por some time past the Government has been watching the nation&apos;s supply of bread with the closest attention.Upon all the figures and estimates then available,  theGovernment came to the conclusion that the only way to make sure of a fair share of bread to every household in theconditions of short supply which threatened, was by meansof a system of bread rationing.      But we have repeatedlysaid that if any change in the supply position occurred whichwould warrant taking a more optimistic view we would informthe public at once.      Accordingly I have several times given a pledge that bread rationing would be suspended the momentI could assure the Government that it was no longer necessaryin order to safeguard an equitable distribution of the people&apos;sfood.      That moment-,  I am happy to say, has come far earlier than I dared to hope.I have received a message by telegram from Mr. Gardiner,the Canadian Minister of Agriculture,  that the new Canadiancrop &quot;is now expected to reach at least 450 million bushels&quot;,This is an increase of at least 100 million bushels onany previous minimum estimate.      In addition,  the canadian wheat Board,  in the past 24 hours, has informed us of itsadvance programme of shipments to this country, showing anadditional supply of wheat to us during August and September.This is, no doubt, because the prospect of the large new crop has encouraged the Canadian farmers to release fromtheir farms still more of the&quot;small quantity remaining fromthe old crop.      We had been hoping for some time that this development would occur, but have only received the assurance of it in the past 24 hours.NORMAN brook cabinet Office,  S.W. 1.20th July,  1946,REVISED DRAFT PUBLIC STATEMENT

These developments mean that our estimated stock ofwheat at the 31st August next has risen from 513,000 tons to 594,000 tons.      They also mean that our estimated stock of wheat at 30th September has risen from 590,000 to 693,000tons.      There will he some 300,000 tons of flour to add tothese figures,  so that our total stocks of wheat and flourat the two dates will now approximate to 9 and 10 weeks&apos;supply respectively.This news from Canada has for the first timeenabled me to advise my colleagues that I am satisfied thatit will be safe to suspend the introduction of bread rationing on Monday next.      -And H.M.  Government has suspendedthe operation of the scheme, .   .The new figures for the end of -August and Septemberare above the point at which the danger of a dislocation in distribution arises.      Should, however,  there he adverse andunexpected developments in the supply position in the nextfew weeks,  it would be necessary at once to put the rationing scheme, which is fully prepared,  into immediate execution.In fact, I urge the bakers and all other concerned in the rationing system to perfect their preparations.    &apos; Thus,  ifrationing did after all become necessary they would be ableto introduce it with minimum disturbance and inconvenience.The Ministry of Food will keep the scheme ready forimmediate application.If,  however,  the supply position continues to improve,we may legitimately hope to avoid.altogether the introductionof bread rationing.i.We owe this good news to the bounty of Providence, tothe wonderful help of our Canadian friends,  and to thepromptitude with which the United States Government are sending us their promised supplies,  partly in repayment ofthe wheat which,  earlier in the summer, we lent to our administration in Western Germany in order to stave offactual famine.      The Government feels that the whole nationwill wish to express its thankfulness.      3y far the best way that we can do that is to redouble our efforts.to economise bread.      Our margin above the safety level is stilla narrow one and the strict prevention of waste by everyoneof us may decide whether or not we have to introduce bread rationing after    all.      I therefore appeal most earnestlyto every man, woman and child in the country to be scrupulouslyeconomical in their use of bread,  and above all to refrain from using it to feed poultry or animals while it is still fit for human consumption.In order to help us to realise how far %e are succeedingin such an economy campaign,  I propose to publish the weekly-figures of the total usage of flour of all kinds in thiscountry from the present date to the end of the difficult period of supply.      The first of these figures, whichnecessarily take some time to collect, will be availablein about two weeks&apos; time.
