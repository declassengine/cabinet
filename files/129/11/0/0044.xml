ASh6.CABINETEXPORTS OP TIMBER FROM GERMANY AHD AUSTRIATO U.K.Memorandum by the Chancellor of&apos; the.....Diucjayof LancasterAt their mooting on tho 2nd July, tho Overseas ReconstructionCommit toe invited rne to submit a further report on timberproduction in the British Zone of Germany.      Since then theMinister of Health has. submitted a paper to the Cabinetentitled &quot;Timber for Housing11  (CP.   (1+6) 277)  in which he refers to tho arrangements for obtaining timber from Germany andemphasises the necessity for obtaining increased amounts and of ensuring results by the most ruthless administrative action.2.      In the meantime I have been pressing the proposal ofsecuring an increase in the rate of export of timber to theUnited Kingdom and have discussed tho problems very fully inGermany with the Coniiian&amp;or-in-Chief, Lt. General Robertsonand Sir Gerald Lenanton.3.      It will be recalled that Sir Gerald Lenanton was secondedby the Board of Trade for the purpose of increasing productionin the British Zone of Germany, because.se of the urgent priorityneeds of the United Kingdom,  and. that the British Home GrownTimber teams and equipment were placed at his disposal.      As aresult, the felling programme has been increased to a rate of300 per cent, of the annual increment of the forests.      Theonly question is what ere the practical steps necessary tomaintain or even increase this programme.4.      The transfer on such a seals of men and equipment from theUnited Kingdom to Germany naturally takes time.      But theoperation is now nearly complete and I am glad to be able toreport that most of the initial difficulties have been overcome.These were,  in particular1,  as follows5&apos;      Transport from rai 1 he ad.....to......ship, - the Transport Divisionof the Control Commission and B.A.C.R. have made strenuous efforts to rehabilitate the transport system of Germany.      I am now satisfied that there is no bottle-neck in this field andthat there is sufficient transport capacity to carry all thotimber which is to be exported.6.      Dock capacity - The main timber areas.are the HarzMountains, Zollingen, and the regions near Arneburg and Luonoburg.Hamburg, Emclcn and Lucbeck are the natural outlets for those areas and their restoration has now reached, a stage which en rilesthen to carry all the present and anticipated traffic oven when

the target figures nro reached.      If v/e woro able to secure any tremendous increase in the cut wo could without difficulty-transfer some of the export traffic, to the Rhine, which isalready carrying the traffic to the Ruhr.7.      \7hon the proposal for Sir Gerald Lonanton&apos;s organisation to go to Gormany was first-made,  a target was fixed for theexport during the period from April to December 191+6 of750,000 tons.      The target rate at the end of the year was put at 1,700,000 tons per year.      It has been consistentlymade clear that those were optimum target figures which wouldnot necessarily bo achieved except under the most favourable conditions.      Although it is still hoped to reach by december next an export rate of 1,250,000 tons pur annum, this will depend largely on the general conditions in the Zone, andparticularly on the factors enumerated below.8,     Labour - German labour is directed into the forests underpenalties of loss of rations and imprisonment.      Skilled forestworkers are exempt from call-up to the coal mines5 but there isstill a serious gap.      Over fifty per cent.&quot; of available malelabour is found on medical examination to be incapable of heavywork, but the greatest shortage of all is in skilled labour,particularly in the supervisory grades, as the British Zone was never one of the main timber producing areas in Germany.     Wehave combed out the D.P. Camps and have managed to recruitlarge numbers of Baits, Poles and Ukrainians.      But in spite ofall our efforts output per man is falling, largely through lackof food.     There is a heavy incidence of desertion which it is virtually impossible to check.      I have asked Manpower division to make a special investigation of methods of increasingrecruitment and preventing desertion.      There are two particularmethods which might be examined of alleviating these labour difficulties -(a) a further drive to obtain additional supervisorystaffs from this country;(b) a modification of the repatriation scheme for german prisonors-of-war in this country,  inorder to give priority to those prisoners whohave gained experience in our forests;(c) an approach to the Canadians for help with skilledsupervisory labour.9*      1 c ck r ofFop d - There are difficulties and risks involvedin making additional rations available to timber workers.The labour is not concentrated so that the issue of the rationscan be easily controlled; and there is great likelihood ofleakage and black market&apos;practices.      Nevertheless,  in view ofthe urgency of the matter, I propose to authorise the grant ofa special increase of rations for forest wozdoors and I havegiven instructions for special emergency measures to boundertaken to provide cooking equipment such as the requisitioning of field kitchens and the construction ofimprovised camp kitchens, to ensure as far as possible thatthe extra food is consumed on the  job.      In addition,  I am advised that a special bonus issue of cigarettes would go along way to improve output, and (although this is attended  .with even greater risks of irregularities)  1 propose to give instructions for a special ration of cigarettes to be issued to forest workers as soon as the German tobacc-o crop is available,  or sooner,  if the cigarettes can be obtainedotherwise.

10.    Accommoelation.     This has not boon a serious problemhitherto.      Locally recruited Germans usually work near enoughto their homos to live -there.      Displaced Persons have boonhoused in camp or transported to and from the job.Nevertheless as operations extend it may be necessary to house the workers nearer to whore the felling takes place and I havegiven instructions for the possibility of providing Nisscn Hutsfrom Army resources to bo explored.11 .    Transport from forest to rnjllhqad.     Tr-onsport out of the- forest has always boon a difficulty.     Tank carriers can ho andare being adapted and used whorevcr the road conditions permit.Aircraft carriers arc- not suitable.      Army four-by-four lorriesarc now being made available as required.     The real ncod isfor caterpillars and &quot;sulkies&quot;.     Special efforts have boonmade to see whether any of those, are available in Germany.I should like to know whether the Secretary of State for war or the Ministry of Supply would bo able to help by sending anyof those vehicles from this country.     Another alternative ishorses.     Wo are trying to recr^yit horses from other work inthe Zone.      If a special ration of feeding stuffs should prove necessary for such horses, stops will bo taken to provide this.12.    Shortage of Equipment.      I found that any groat extensionof operations might he hold up somewhat by shortage of machinesaws.      I have given instructions for one of the largestmachine saw factories in Germany to go into production eventhough this will mean a special diversion of coal and stoolfrom other essential purposes.13.    Domestic Allocations. *I attach for the information of my colleagues at Annex Aa summary of sawn timber bids and allocations for the thirdquarter of 19h7 from which it will be seen that we are onlysupplying about h3% of the minimum essential needs of ourzone.     It is clear that if any of these allocations werefurther cut we should seriously imperil our already stringenteconomy in the Zone, with effects on the cutting and transportof timber itself.      Nevertheless an urgent survey is being made into the possibilities of some cut.      At the same time, it mustnot bo overlooked that any such cuts might have otherrepercussions.      At present we receive about 30,000 tons of pitprops per month from the Amorloan Zone which wo could not afford to lose, and the Americans would certainly object if it were tooclearly emphasized that this contribution was in fact a subsidy to our exports of pit props from our Zone to the United Kingdom.&apos;1 k-.    International Obligations.It should be borne in mind too, that even our presentoperations are open to criticism by our Allies since all timberavailable for export from the British Zone should properly bosubmitted in the first place to the E.E.O.E. for allocation.Moreover since the export of timber is a matter which concernsI Germany as a whole, it should normally be dealt with throughthe quadripartite machinery in Berlin in the same way as coalbefore any exportable surplus is declared.     We are,  in fact,by-passing both these procedures only because of the urgencyI of United Kingdom requirements.     So. far, we have not boonchallenged in this respect.     But the obligation remains.

15.    Austria.I have further looked into the question of Austrian timber,although the Austrian Government now controls its own exports.We ho,d originally hoped to purchase 100,000 standards but it now seems unlikely that we shall get more than twenty per cent,of this, of which   we shall probably have to take half infabricated form such as furniture.      There arc othercompetitors in the market and the Austrians cannot afford to ignore the much better prices offered elsewhere, particularlyin view of their anxiety to establish some kind of economyafter UNRRA1s aid has ceased.      Nevertheless,  I have had discussions with the Austrian Chancellor and other AustrianMinisters, and they are anxious to find an accommodation withthe United Kingdom in recognition of the- considerable assistance already rendered to them by this country.1^*    conclusions to sum up, the only serious remaining bottlenecks inGermany are  shortage of skilled labour&apos;, food,  and transportfrom forest to railhead,  and I have indicated the  steps weare taking to deal with these within Germany.      In additionI make the following proposals:-(a) a further drive to obtain additional supervisorystaffs from this country should be made;(b) the repatriation scheme for German prisoners-of-war might bo modified to give priority to those whohave had experience in our forests;(c) we might consider asking the Canadians to help us with skilled supervisory labour;Yd) wo should see whether there are any further/ suitable vehicles which can be sent from theI United Kingdom to assist in&apos; transport from* forest to railhead.(Intld.)
