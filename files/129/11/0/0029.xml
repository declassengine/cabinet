[mice!7]     ^ojy : &quot;8- ezfylTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1946.Copy No.    38CABINET.DISPOSAL OF GERMAN MERCHANT SHIPS OBTAINED ASREPARATION BY THE UNITED KINGDOM GOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.(a) Determination of United Kingdom Share of German Merchant Shipping.1&apos;. At the Potsdam Conference it was agreed that, subject to the retentionof a minimum tonnage to meet local needs of German economy, the balance of theGerman merchant fleet should be divided into three equal parts for the U.S.S.R.,United Kingdom and the United States, leaving provision to be made from theUnited States and United Kingdom shares for other maritime Allies, exceptPoland, for which provision was to be made from the share of U.S.S.R. Theaction taken to give effect to the tripartite division of the German merchant fleetbetween the three major Powers was reported in CP. (45) 350 and approved.2. To provide for the participation of the other maritime Allies (exceptPoland) entitled by their war losses of merchant shipping to a share of the german merchant fleet, the United Kingdom and United States shares of the German fleetwere submitted, in accordance with the Reparations Agreement of the 14thJanuary, 1946, for re-allocation by the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency among theGovernments signatory to the Agreement in proportion to their respective losses of merchant shipping throughout the war. This re-allocation has now been madeby the Inter-Allied Reparation Agency. A summary of the result is given inAppendix I. The final United Kingdom share of the German merchant fleetconsists of 349,627 gross registered tons (less one ship of about 1,000 gross tonsthat we have to find for Newfoundland). We have good reason to be satisfied withthis share.(b) Proposals for Disposal of the United Kingdom Share of the German MerchantFleet.3. The German merchant ships forming part of the United Kingdom sharehave been or will be seized in prize and, when the prize proceedings have beencompleted, will be the property of the Crown.4. Other United Kingdom Government-owned tonnage suitable for disposalhas been or is being disposed of in accordance with the Scheme approved by theCabinet (CP. (45) 299^1 CP. (45) 324). Under this Scheme, Government-owned ships have been offered for sale, with the option in suitable cases of bareboatcharter for a period not exceeding 5 years, to United Kingdom owners or, undercsrtain conditions, to owners in other parts of the British Commonwealth. (Afew types of craft of no particular value for our purposes have been offered tobuyers in any part of the world.) This Scheme was designed to assist owners withthe immediate replacement of their war losses while at the same time causing theleast interference with plans for replacement building. Subject to certain reser-vations, I propose to dispose of our share of the German merchant ships inaccordance with the Scheme.5.-   The reservations are as follows :^ (i) Our allocation of German ships includes about 100,000 gross tons of passenger vessels which have been or are being converted for trooping(except one which is unfit for any further service). I shall retain thosesuitable for trooping so long as they can be used for the purpose.(The unserviceable ships I shall dispose of as opportunity offers,probably for scrapping.)SECRET.CP. (46) 279.18*/*, July, 1946.
(ii) I also propose to exclude from the public offer : (a) 8 ships under construction in the British zone of Germany, until they are completed.(b) A cable ship required by the Post Office.(iii) Certain special ships included in our share have been or will be disposedof separately as follows : (a) The Whaling Factory has already been offered for sale to ourWhaling Companies. It was important to deal with this shipurgently so that she could be ready for the next whaling season.She has been sold to a South African Whaling Company.(b) 4 Banana ships are to be sold to the two United Kingdom firms who have lost similar ships.(iv) I propose to confine the offer to United Kingdom owners.   The losses of other parts of the Commonwealth have already been taken intoaccount in the allocation by I.A.R.A. and we can reasonably regardour share of the German ships as being wholly for United Kingdompurposes.6. The German ships available for offer immediately under the DisposalScheme will amount to about 200,000 gross tons.7. Some apprehension has been felt lest we should repeat the mistakesalleged to have been made in the disposal of German tonnage obtained byreparation after the last war. The text of a Question and Answer in theHouse of Commons on the 8th June, 1944, is given in Appendix 2. After thelast war the United Kingdom share was 1,528,938 gross tons out of a totalof 2,187,267 gross tons of German ships available for all the Allies. The ships in the United Kingdom share were sold at relatively low prices to UnitedKingdom shipowners. In 1922 a slump in shipping was experienced and theUnited Kingdom shipyards suffered severely. This latter consequence, mainly due to general economic conditions, was widely attributed at the time to thesale of German ships at low prices to United Kingdom owners, the argumentbeing that the ex-German ships removed from the United Kingdom ownersany incentive to build new ships at the time that the market was falling.8. The situation to-day is materially different and the disposal policy wehave adopted is not open to such objections.(a) The German merchant shipping available as reparations to the western allies is only one-third of that available last time; and the United Kingdom shareinstead of being over two-thirds of the total is rather less than one-half. TheUnited Kingdom share is less than a quarter of the United Kingdom share in 1919.(b) The average age of the German ships is appreciably greater than in1919, due to the fact that Germany&apos;s main shipbuilding effort after the last war was in the 1920&apos;s. The newer ships consist largely of war-time standardships. These are utility ships whose efficient lifetime is a matter of specula-tion as they are constructed partly of &apos;&apos; Thomas &apos;&apos; steel, the qualities of which for merchant ships have yet to be proved. The age of many of the ships, and theuncertain quality of the newer ones, is rather in their favour than otherwiseas our need for them is essentially temporary. A number of ships will haveended their useful life by the time our post-war rebuilding programme is falling off and their replacement at that time will help to maintain the output ofour yards.(c) The primary immediate need of our shipping industry is to have ships for operation now to reinstate their connections throughout the world. Theindustry cannot afford to wait for this purpose till new ships are built; butthe need is essentially for &apos;&apos; stop gap &apos;&apos; tonnage while the building programme is in progress. . The option of bareboat charter for a relatively short periodof years, which I propose to give for all the German ships offered generally, is designed to help in this direction.(d) Minimum sale prices and rates of hire will be established for theGerman ships offered on a basis comparable to the minimum fixed for our owntonnage already disposed of.
Conclusion.9. I recommend That I be authorised to offer the merchant ships acquired by the United Kingdom Government as reparation from Germany (subject tothe reservations in paragraph 5), for sale or bareboat charter to United Kingdomowners only, on terms comparable to those upon which we have disposed of other united Kingdom Government-owned tonnage.A. B.Ministry of Transport,18th July, 1946.APPENDIX I.Allocation of German Merchant Ships by I.A.R.A.1. After allowing for tonnage allocated to the German peace-time economy and after deducting the Russian share the total of the British and United Statesshares of the German Merchant tonnage available for redistribution between theWestern Allies was approximately 750,000 g.t. Of this some 61,000 g.t. con-sisted of ships which were virtually wrecks and not wanted by any nation, leaving689,000 to be distributed.2. The -final allocation of this tonnage was agreed by the Assembly of theInter-Allied Reparations Agency in Brussels on the 24th May. The percentageshare of each country was based upon the shipping losses suffered through acts of war, and agreement as to the amount of each share was first reached after an examination of the claims of the country concerned.3. The following table shows the amount allocated to each country in com-parison with the amount due according to the agreed percentages :  Summary Statement of Allocations.Nation.

The United Kingdom Allocation consists of 349,627 g.t. and is slightly in excess of the tonnage to which the United Kingdom was theoretically entitled.The United Kingdom representatives were instructed to attach the highest priority to passenger ships, of which we are in urgent need. Next priority was to be givento banana ships and ocean-going tankers. In the event, the United kingdom share contains all the passenger ships except the Europa (which we did not want),all but one of the serviceable tankers over 1,000 g.t., the better of the two very valuable whale factories, and 4 out of the 6 banana ships. The allocation also includes all but one (which is in the United States zone) of the new ships nearing completion.5. With two exceptions (India and Yugoslavia), all countries co-operatedwell in the negotiations. South Africa waived her claim, and United Statestook only 35 per cent, of her theoretical share. This latter fact made it much easier to reach agreement between the many countries concerned.

Mr. Kirkwood asked the Prime Minister if he is aware that, after thelast war, German reparations resulted in serious unemployment in the ship-building, engineering and other industries of this country; and if he will give an assurance that steps will be taken at the peace settlement with Germany tomake certain that no reparations will be exacted which may have the effect ofinjuring either our home or export trade and thus causing unemployment inGreat Britain.The Prime Minister: Yes, Sir.Mr. Kirkwood: I want to ask the Prime Minister if he wilf see to it that atthe peace settlement there will be no reparations such as those we had after thelast war. Is he aware that we took not only the German Navy but the whole ofthe German mercantile marine and that the Government of that day sold thatmercantile marine to the shipowners of this country for  5 a ton when we couldnot build ships at that time under  28 a ton, with the result that the whole ofthe shipbuilding engineering industry in this country was thrown out of gear ?The Prime Minister.- I can assure my hon. Friend that that is most fully inour minds.  He and I both had vivid experience of those days.Mr. Kirkwood: The right hon. Gentleman was a good friend to the men,too, at that time.The Prime Minister: Thank you very much. I am sure that the mistakesof that time will not be repeated; we shall probably make another set of mistakes.
