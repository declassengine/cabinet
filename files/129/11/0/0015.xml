 THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&apos;)S E C R E T COPY NO.      j  .G.P. (46)  265.9TH JULY, 1946.CABINETAGRICULTURAL PRICES  ;  SPECIAL REVIEWfMemorandum by Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries;Secretary of State for Scotland and Secretaryof State for Home Department.1. Under the procedure for fixing agricultural prices instituted inFebruary 1945 and endorsed by the present Government in the statement on agricultural policy made by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries on 15th November, 1945 (approved by the Cabinet on 13thNovember, 1945 - reference CM. (45) 52nd Conclusions)? provision ismade for the holding of a special review &quot;in the event of an importantchange in the situation, such as might arise from a sudden and substantial change in costs.&quot;2. The award by the Agricultural Wages Board for England and Wales of-Pah increase of 10/- per week in the agricultural minimum wage, to operate from 14th July, constitutes such a &quot;sudden and substantial  .   -change&quot; and a special review has accordingly been held by our .Departments with the National Farmers1 Unions of the United Kingdom.3,, Our Departments were unable, on this occasion, to reach even a tentative and provisional agreement with the Farmers&apos; Unions.      the gap between the farmers&apos; claims and the amount which the officials.felt entitled to discuss with thorn was too wide to be bridged.4. The officials accordingly made recommendations,  to which the--farmers were not in any way committed, for adjustments, in recognitionof the increased costs of production resulting from the wages award,in the prices of(a) crops from the 1946 harvest, for which prices were fixed in March 1945:(b) livestoc-k and. livestock products in the current&quot;livestock year&quot; for which prices were fixed inMarch 1946;(c) crops from the 1947 harvest, for which prices were fixed in March 1946, -5.  Our officials also recommended certain, special and temporaryallowances for producers of milk, pigs, poultry and eggs, to assist them in mooting the serious losses, booth of capital and income, whichthey will incur as a result of the drastic cuts in foeclingstuffsrations which are being imposed.6. Our own submissions on the basis of these recommendations havebeen considered by the Lord President&apos;o Committee (L.P.(45) 24thConclusions) who -(l)    Invited the Agricultural Ministers to prepare a revisedmemorandum in the light of the points raised in ctis-cussion and&apos; to, circulate it for consideration &quot;by theCabinet at their meeting on 11th July.1        (2)    Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would arrange to discuss the points which he had raised with the Agricultural Ministers before the memorandumreferred to in (l) was circulated.
7, After taking account of the views expressed by our colleagues..onthe Lord President&apos;s Committed, and after discussion., with-theChancellorj we put forward the following proposals for cabinet approval.Crops of the 1946 Harvest ,   .8. The increase in wage rates from 14th July onwards in England andWales will have a substantial effect on the cost of harvesting the1946 crops, the prices for which were fixed in March 1945 and notaltered in March 1946.      The global effect for the United Kingdom,        jon the assumption that corresponding increases in wage rates takeplace in Scotland and- Northern Ireland soon after 14th July, isestimated at approximately  4 millions.9. The specific, price adjustments we recommend are set out inAppendix. A.      They are estimated to produce an aggregate increase infarmers&apos; /tross returns-(out of which, of course, the farmers willhave to meet the increased labour costs)  of  3,S72,000 in the&quot;selling&quot; year August, 1946 to July, 1947.10, This total is subject to reduction from the point of view of theExchequer to the extent of  206,000 which v/ill be borne by the brewers (for barley bought at the maximum price) and  400,000 which  /ill be an increased receipt by the War Office in respect of prisonersof war, making a net total of  3,872,000 less  606,000 ^  3,266,000.Livestock and Livestock Products11. Prices for milk for the year 1st April 1946 to 51st March 1947,and for fat cattle, sheep, pigs and eggs for the year 1st July 1946to 30th June 1947, were fixed in March 1946 following on the compre-hensive review of the financial and economic position of agriculture,and the national requirements, which was held in the preceding month.12, The incidence of higher wages on the finished product obviouslyvaries.     For milk the increased labour cost will be reflected almost immediately in the cost of the product;    for pigs and eggs also thelabour costs, v/ill apply quickly;    for fat cattle and fat sheep the incidence is more gradual.      Those considerations have been takeninto account in our recommendations, which are set out in Appendix B.The price increases&apos; we propose are estimated to produce an aggregateincrease in farmers&apos;&apos;gross returns, in a full year, of  9,602,000.13. Although it is necessary, in order to assess the effect of theseproposed price increases, to estimate the aggregate increase infarmers&apos;  returns for a full year, it should be borne in mind that thenew prices for livestock and livestock products will only operate, inthe case of milk until 31st March, 1947, and, in the case of theother products, until 30th June, 194-7.      Prices for milk, fat cattle,sheep, pigs and eggs for the yearly periods subsequent to those dateswill come under review next February and will be fixed by theGovernment in the light of that review.Crops of the 1947 Harvest14, Prices for crops of the 1947 harvest were also fixed in march last, after the February review.     Our recommended changes in prices are set out in Appendix C.      They are estimated to produce an aggregateincrease in farmers&apos; gross returns of  7,541,000 in the &quot;selling&quot;year August, 1947 to July, 1948.15, Unless there are any further substantial changes in costs, it willnot be necessary to change these prices again.      The crop prices, tobe considered at next February&apos;s review will be those for crops ofthe 1948 harvest.J16, We desire to draw attention to the following special features inour recommendations^-
(a)    For fat cattle it is proposed to confine the price increase to steers, heifers and cow-heifers.      Cows,hulls? and rejects would receive no price increase under this head. 3 i(to)    For oats the proposed price increase is appreciablybelow, and for barley very substantially below * theestimated increased cost of producing those crops.(c) For fat sheep, potatoes and sugar beet the prioeincreases we recommend are approximately equal to orslightly less than a conservative estimate of theincrease in cost of production.(d) The cases where an appreciable increase over theestimated rise in cost of production is recommendedare fat pigs, eggs and (particularly) milk and wheat.17. These variations have been made in the light of national require-ments.      It is most desirable to encourage producers of pigs, eggs and milk to maintain the highest possible level of production in the face of the serious difficulties with which they will have to contend forsome considerable time to come*     As regards wheat, all the evidence we have received from our own officers in the countryside goes to showthat a very substantial increase in the wheat price for the 1947 cropis essential if the desired minimum area of 2-g- million, acres is to beobtained without a great deal of friction and resistance.      It isalso proposed that this opportunity should be taken of reducing stillfurther - and indeed eliminating - the disparity which has for long-existed between wheat and barley returns.Effect in a &quot;full&quot; year18. To get an estimate of the global effect on farmers&apos;  grossreturns in a &quot;full&quot; year it is necessary to add the aggregateincrease for livestock and livestock.products, referred to inparagraph IS, to the aggregate increase for. the &quot;selling&quot; year forcrops of the 1947 harvest, referred to in paragraph 14,000Livestock and Livestock Products 9,602Crops of the 1947 Harvest 7,54117,143This compares With an estimate of  18-g- millions for the increase inhired labour costs alone for a full year, on the assumptions thatthere will not be, for some considerable time at all events, anyreductions in hours of work or in premiums paid over and abovestatutory rates for ordinary time and- overtime.      These assumptionswo consider to be valid under present circumstances of labour shortageand the demand for maximum output.19. The increased call on the Exchequer will be less than  17,143,000.The increased amount which farmers will pay for prisoner of warlabour ( 1.8 millions) will be, in effect, a payment to the War Office.From the point of view of the Exchequer, therefore, the position in afull year will be as follows:- Estimated extra gross receipts by farmers 17,143,000Less return to War Office 1,800,00015,545,000SO. We should, however, point out that even the reduced estimate of 15,343,000 may turn out&quot; to be an over-estimate.      The calculations ofglobal cost have been.related to the agricultural output of 1945/6, andit appears to be extremely probable that, owing to the cut in feeding-stuffs, the output of 1946/7 and 1947/8 may be lower.      Thus, the prioeincreases we have recommended, if, as is likely, they are applied tosmaller quantities of .output than we have assumed, will result in a
smaller increase in the notional &quot;full&quot; year than  17,143,000 inthe receipts by farmers and. a smaller increase than  15,343,000 inthe ca.ll on the Exchequer.     We are not, however, able to estimate the extent to which the final amounts will he lower than thesefigures.      The extra receipts by United. Kingdom farmers will alsobe reduced- by the amount which inevitably trickles back to Eire-farmers in the form- of&quot; an. increase in the price of their store cattle.This sum may&apos;be of the order of  300,000.21. We should also draw the attention of the Cabinet to thefollowing points:--   (a)    No account has been taken in arriving at the figure of 18-g- millions of the effect on costs of production of increases in costs other than labour.    &apos;: Such increases have undoubtedly taken place, but the farmers were told, that since they could not in themselves be said to be &quot;sudden and substantial&quot; they could not be brought.into account on theoccasion of this Special Review.      The effect of this rulingis that farmers will have to wait for&quot;the next -Februaryreview before account can be taken of these increases in costs in fixing prices, which will even&apos; then-apply to- future periods.(b)    The labour costs themselves, on which this figure is calculated, relate to &apos; increased costs for hired labouronly;    that is, no allowance has been made for corres-ponding. increased remuneration to the farmer and his wife.This also the farmers have been told is unacceptable inprinciple, but the effect will undoubtedly.be to reducethe net returns of the employer of hired labour, both  -absolutely - by about &apos;30% - and., still more, by comparison with the farmer who does not employ hired, labour..(c)    In the case of the 1947 crops there is a long &quot;lag&quot;between the rise in labour costs and recoupment, on the saleof the product.      This is a normal feature of farming economybut every increase in outgoings of this sort make anadditional call on the farmers&apos; working capital.Special and temporary allowances22. We have also considered, and discussed&apos;with the Chancellor, thecase put forward by the National Farmers&apos; Unions for some recognition,either by a supplementary and temporary adjustment of prices or other-wise, of the effect on farmers&apos;  returns of the&apos;substantial Change inthe economic position &apos;of the industry occasioned by&apos; the forthcomingsevere cut in rations of animal feedingstuffs.23. It is undeniable that the setback to the production of milk, bacon and eggs resulting from these cuts,  imposed at comparatively short notice, will be serious and will involve many producers in substantiallosses, both of capital and income.&apos;    --At the same time we are urgingthem to make every effort, in the national interest, to maintain theproduction of these commodities at the highest level possible.     Weconsider that there is a-strong case, in equity and in the national interest, for assistance over this difficult period.24. We therefore propose that the special and. temporary pricesupplements and grants set out in Appendix. D should be awarded.      Thetotal estimated cost to- the Exchequer is  3,928,000.      It will be observed that all the bonus payments proposed are confined&apos; to theimmediate future on the assumption that there will be some improvementin supplies- of feedingstuffs before the winter of 1947/8.-     Shouldthose hopes be falsified it would probably be necessary, especially    Jin regard to milk, to review the position next summer. &apos;   -Farmers will?however, by then have had an opportunity of adjusting their production programmes to the new conditions and the problem will therefore havebeen appreciably alleviated.
Conclusion.25.. Intensive effort in food production, not only in this&apos; country, butin every country in the world, depends fundamentally on securing and maintaining the goodwill of large numbers of individual producers,working independently with a wide variety of materials and under* widely diverse conditions.      We are calling on farmers and farmworkers in the United Kingdom not only to continue but to  intensifythe efforts they have been making for the past six years to produce the food the nation needs, and to do this under increasingly difficult conditions.      Farm workers will receive an increase in the reward fortheir labour under the award of the Agricultural Wages Board...     Theproposals in this memorandum do no more than recoup,  in part, theincreased labour costs resulting from this award, and offset, again in part, the losses in capital and income which will inevitably fallon producers of milk, pigs and eggs in the next six to  eight months.We ask for our colleagues  approval to them.SUMMARY25. We accordingly recommend(a) that prices of crops of the 194-6 harvest should beincreased as proposed in Appendix. A:(b) that the current prices of livestock and livestock products should be increased as proposed in Appendix B;(c) that prices of crops of the 1947 harvest should beincreased as proposed in Appendix C;(d) that special and temporary bonuses to producers of milk, pigs and eggs should be given as proposed inAppendix P.T.

The heavy reduction inissues of feedingstuffs will cause a conseaueatialsubstantial decline in the production of milk whichmust not only affect the farmer1 s income tut may also require some liquidation of his capital through the&apos;sale of dairy cows which he can no longer feed.      Theloss in income resulting from lower output of milk isestimated very conservatively at somewhat more than 4 millions.      It is considered that a bonus should begiven to milk producers for a limited period and that- this bonus should be added to the milk prlee duringthose months mien output is lowest and the need for anadditional incentive to farmers to make the maximumeffort is greatest.      The payment of a bonus calculatedat the rate of 2d. per gallon during the months ofNovember, December and January is&apos; accordinglyrecomrnended.      The estimated cost is  2,608,000.(2)    If there should be an unexpected improvement in thesupplies of feedingstuffs available for dairy cowsbefore 1st January, 1947, we should propose to reducethe bonus at the rate of - d.  per gallon for each75,000 tons increase in feedingstuffs supplies.      Thesame formula could be used in the reverse direction ifsupplies of feedingstuffs should unhappily becomestill smaller.(3)    As a further step towards- the maintenance of milk production at the highest practicable level it hasbeen suggested that farmers should be encouraged tocull their herds more heavily and to  send for slaughterlow yielding cows, the removal of which would releasefeedingstuffs that when given to the remainder of theherd should lead to an improvement in yield per cow.This proposal is a matter that requires further inter-departmental discussion but we recommend that authority should be given for the introduction of a scheme for assisting the disposal of low-grade cows during the nextfew months at an estimated cost of  about  200,000.Pi asThe reduction in feedingstuffs will fall upon the pigproducer from 1st July (owing to the introduction of 90 per cent ^extraction flour) and will be continued throughout the winter period.Breeders will therefore have on their hands a number of young pigsfrom sows farrowing prior to this date for which there will be amuch reduced demand.      There will also be a number of sows, matedprior to the 4th June, when the reduction in  rations was announced,that will be farrowing from now until the end of October, for theprogeny of which there will also be a much reduced market.      J4s a partial offset to these losses,  the full extent of which it isimpossible to calculate, we make the following r-recommendations -(a)   A payment of  4 per head for each sow farrowing from15th July to 31st October.      The maximum number of sowsthat could farrow during this period would be 200,000involving a total payment of some  800,000, but some allowance must be made: for sows which may be s 1 a.ughtered .although in pig and it is probable that  the  total cost involved would not exceed  600,000.(b)

(b)   A temporary increase in the price of light weight pigsof 3/- per score from 15th July to 2nd November.      Thepresent price of such pigs is 24/9d. per score comparedwith a basic price for the standard bacon pig of 28/961.per score,      assuming that 250,000 pigs will qualify forthis bonus the total cost would be  187,000,Poultry and EggsThe reduction in rations will fall heavily upon the poultryindustry, which responded much more rapidly than the pig industry tothe increase in ration scales that was introduced in the summer of1945,      We propose (i) that the price of eggs should be raised by4d, per dozen from 18th July to 30th November at an estimated costof  333,000;    (ii)  that discussion should take place between theDepartments concerned (including the Treasury) on the question of asmall addition to the price of table poultry in recognition of theenforced culling which v/ill take place,  ,  Table poultry is not oneof the price review commodities, so that any such increase in price would not involve any cost to the Exchequer,summary the estimated total cost of these supplementary payments is:- 000Milk 2,603Pat Cows 200Parrowing Sows 600Light,weight Pigs 187Eggs 333Total cost to Exchequer 3,928
