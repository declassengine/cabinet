SB C R_E TC.P.(h6)  500 COPYHO.^.30 th. July,  &apos;\9bfi.CABINETIRON AND STEEL:_EST,.3LISHHEUT OP INTERIM COHTROL board memorandum by the Minister of SupplyMy colleagues will wish to know the present Dositionconcerning the proposed establishment of a Control Board to supervise the steel industry during the period, before public ownership.2, I had hoped, to be able to announce the membership ofthis Board in the House of Commons before the recess.      But Ihave been badly held up because the Iron and Steel Federation,after a number or discussions with ae and. my advisers,  intimated that, while they were prepared to co-ooeretc willingly with whateverGovernment agency was charged!with the&quot;control of&quot;the industry,they could not associate themselves with membership of theprooocod Control Board,  inasmuch as it would be pert of the dutiesof the members or the Board to give guidance and advice on technical unit tors e rising in regard &quot;to n. wbionslioution.   .y% I considered, whether,  in the light of the Federation1 s &apos;attitude,  I should be justified in appointing a Control Boardcomposed entirely of aien without direct experience of the steelIndustry.      I came to the conclusion, however,   (with theconcurrence of my colleagues on the Socialisation of industries committee)  that both from the standpoint of public presentationand of actual working it would be wrong for me to adopt such acourse,  particularly because of the importance and complexity of the issues to be dealt with by the Board.h, I thereupon made some enquiries as to the possibilityof obtaining one or more men of first class standing from theUnited Kingdom steel industry notwithstanding the attitude of theFederation.      I ascertained,  however,  that although, there is reason to believe that some of the younger leaders of theindustry are uneasy at the policy followed by the Federation,no outstanding member of the industry would be prepared,  inview of the Federation&apos;s attitude,  to accept an invitation tojoin the Board at present.5. Following upon consultations which I had with the lord president of the Council and. the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Prime Minister approved the issue of on invitation to dr.  Van der bill,  the&apos;head of I.S.C.O.R.,  to become Chairmanof the Board.      Field Marshal Smuts was good enough to say thathe would be prepared to snare Dr. Van der bill for service.Dr. Van der bill offered to come to England immediately for consultation, while not committing himself as to acceptance ofthe position of Chairman.6. Dr. Von der bill has now arrived and has had a number of discussions with me and my advisers.      He has also seen thePrime Minister,  the Lord President, of the Council and theChancellor of the Exchequer.7. While not giving any final answer, Dr.  Van der bill has intimated that he would be most reluctant to accept theChairmanship of the Board except perhaps for a very limited period

of two or three months.      He agrees with my view that theBoard should comprise one or more persons of first rate standingwith direct experience of the United Kingdom steel industryif it is to function effectively.      He has, therefore,suggested that he should he empowered to discuss with theleaders of the iron and steel industry here certain proposalswhich,  in his view, might induce them to alter their present attitude,of non-co-operation in the matter of membership of .the Board. . *8. Dr. Van der bill is still preparing details of theproposals which he thinks might he acceptable to the Federation.I cannot therefore say more at present than that Dr. Van derBijl feels that the attitude of the leaders of.the industry might be modified if they could be assured that the Governmentplans, while providing for complete Government control in thelast analysis, would allow the retention of a measure ofprivate ownership.      Such a procedure would be broadly similar to that followed in South Africa.9. Clearly it will be necessary for Dr. Van der bill&apos;sproposals, when formulated,  to be closely scrutinised.      Ingeneral I could not recommend the acceptance of any proposalswhich would in any sense be a surrender to the Federation, or could be so regarded,  or which would be a complete departure from the principle of &quot;transfer to the ownership of thenation of appropriate sections of the iron end steel industry&quot;(to quote the terms of the resolution adopted by the House ofCommons on the 28th May).      But I have always thought that provided the Government possessed absolute final votingcontrol  (e.g.  through a holding company) there would be muchto be said for retaining the structure and identity of atleast the leading companies in the industry, with theirexisting technical staffs,  goodwill,  service contracts andthe like, and for permitting a measure of continued private investment.      In any such arrangements special attention wouldhave to be given to such matters as  (a) the right of share-holders to dispose of their stock if they did not wish toretain it under the revised conditions which would then obtainand (b)   the supervision of the dividend policy of thecompanies.10.       While I cannot yet submit any detailed proposals to mycolleagues, it seems to me that nothing would be lost of dr. Van der bill were authorised to draw up proposals on thelines which he has in mind, on the understanding that(a) insofar as he has any preliminary discussions with theIron and Steel Federation these must be on the basis thathe has no authority from the Government to negotiate any proposals and (b) the Government will reserve the full rightto reject his proposals if they are considered to be incompatible with the broad lines of policy approved byParliament in May.11.        I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that I should authorise Dr. Van der bill to proceed as rapidly as possibleto formulate his proposals for the Government&apos;s consideration.In order to save time I suggest that authority should be givento the Lord President of the Council,  the Chancellor of  theExchequer and myself to examine Dr. Van der bill&apos;s proposalswhen presented and,  if we regard them as generally acceptable,to authorise him to discuss them further with the federation as a possible modus vivendi which, without compromising anyessential principle, will secure their co-operation on theproposed Control Board.J. W.Ministry of Supply,  S.W.1.,30th July, 1946.
