(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (1+6)  275 COPY NO, &apos;-&apos; c17TH JULY,  19^6CABIMETAMENDMENT OF BRITISH NORTH AME.RICA.ACTJ31g7 - T9I+5Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Dominion affairs attach (Annex I) a telegram which the Acting HighCommissioner for Canada has received from the canadian government foreshadowing a formal request by the canadian government for legislation to be enacted here before Parliamentadjourns for the Summer Recess,   to amend the British. north america Acts so as to provide for the readjustment of canadian representation in the Canadian House of Commons.An advance copy of the address to His Majesty the King fromthe House of Commons of Canada which embodies the text of theproposed Act of Parliament here is appended as Annex II,I had already heard about this from our High Commissioner inCanada and a copy of a telegram from him is appended as annex IIIi2. Legislation by the United Kingdom Parliament isrequired since an amendment of the British North America act of 1867 is in question.      The procedure adopted by theCanadian authorities follows closely that adopted on thelast occasion, namely in 1943.      It is much to he regretted thatas on that occasion the Canadian Government have seen fit to request legislation here at such very short notice, moreespecially since,  as&apos;appears from the last paragraph, of annex III,  their haste is due to their desire to forestallopposition from certain quarters in Canada,.      NeverthelessI feel that,in spite of the inconvenience and objections weaught to meet the wishes of the Canadian Government if at allpossible, end I trust that my colleagues will eigree that weshould introduce and pass a Ball as proposed before Parliamentrises,3. I have felt it necessary to bring this matter beforethe Cabinet immediately without prior reference to the legislation committee in view of the extreme urgency if action is to oetaken as requested.Dominions Office,  S.W-,17th July,  1 9^-1-6.

Act.In discussing recently with Norman Robertson I pointedout that United Kingdom Parliamentary programme was already veryfull and expressed hope that on this occasion matters could beso arranged that United Kingdom Government would have reasonablemargin of time in which to pass necessary legislation.Robertson reverted to subject when I saw him yesterday and said that Canadian authorities had been thinking over timetable.They were most anxious to meet convenience of United KingdomGovernment as far as they possibly could,  on the other handsituation here had developed in such a way as to make it most desirable that the legislation should be passed by UnitedKingdom parliament before it rises for Summer Recess insteadof being left over until the autumn.      He wanted to give usearliest possible warning of this.2. Position here is that resolution for amendment of act has now been adopted by Senate as well as by House ofCommons and is in process of being engrossed preparatory to being forwarded to London through the Governor-General.Robertson said that as soon as it reaches London (which may-no t be for another week owing to absence both of Speaker ofSenate and of Governor-General) Rudd will be instructed to approach United Kingdom Government with formal request forpassage of necessary legislation before parliament rises forthe summer.      I pointed out that this was just the situation   &apos;which i had hoped would be avoided,  since it would give UnitedKingdom Government very little time in which to fit in bill and might cause serious inconvenience and dislocation.Robertson replied that this was fully appreciated by canadian authorities and they much regretted having to make this request at such -short notice but matter hud a politicalbackground and circumstances were such as to leave them no option.3.  .

Duplessis however has taken strong stand in Quebec on what he regards as invasion of provincial rights (indeed QuebecGovernment have taken unusual step in recording theirattitude of protest in a formal order in Council) and fearis that unless prompt action is taken to give effect to dominion parliaments resolution now that it has been adoptedhe may be tempted to embark on-campaign of agitation whichmight have unfortunate consequences in other fields ofpolicy as well.      I gathered too that there is someapprehension that Duplessis may be planning to visit london with a view to enlisting support for his attitude in theUnited Kingdom.      Canadian Government are very anxious toshort circuit this.
