THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-:-37The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of............J^x......As^y^^y. .&quot;SoTOP SECRET Copy No.      ......CP.(46)  26710TH  JULY.  1946.CABINETPALESTINEAN0L0-U.S.  REPORT - MILITARY IMPLICATIONSReport by the Chiefs, of StaffWe have had an opportunity of seeing the Rep-c^t by theSecretary of State for the Colonies&apos;  on the implications cfgiving effect to the Anglo-U. S. Report on Palestine.      Weemphatically endorse what is said by the Secretary of state on the strategic effects of adopting the Report -paragraphs 25 and 26.2.      We would emphasise to  the Cabinet once again, that inour view the reaction throughout the Middle East to theadoption of the Report would be extremely unfavourable, anddisastrous to British interests.      The present belief ofthe Arab States in 3ritish good faith and in the benefitsarising from friendship with Great Britain would be destroyed.There will in consequence be a long period of unrestthroughout the Arab world, the military implications of whichare formidable.3.      All our defence requirements  in the Middle East,including maintenance of our essential oil supplies and communications,  demand that an essential feature of our policy should be to retain the co-operation of the arab states, and to ensure that the Arab world does notgravitate towards the Russians.      In view of the increasinginterest of the United States in the area it is also ofimportance to the Americans to retain the goodwill of theAr ab s.4.     We cannot stress too strongly the importance of middle east oil resources to us both in peace and war.      We considerthat this factor alone makes the retention of Arab friendshipessential.      The vulnerability of our existing sources of oil makes it imperative that we should seek to developareas more remote from possible attack, but our ability todo  this will be seriously prejudiced if we incur the hostility of the Arabs./    CP. (46)  258.   --1-

5.      We cannot therefore afford a long period of unrestthroughout the Arab world.      Moreover, without the facilities in Egypt, and without any permanent or assured control of cyrenaica we  should find it difficult to counter  thisdisorder effectively and protect our vital interests  in theMiddle East unless we had full control in Palestine.6.      As regards the military results in Palestine itself,we clearly foresee the following:-(a) There will be a general Arab rising in Palestine,more serious and more widespread than in 1936and 1938/1939.      This rising will be supportedby volunteers and arms from neighbouring arab states.      In addition, attacks on British and jewish personnel and property will take place.(b) Jewish territorists will seek every occasion tocontinue their campaign of violence.7.      The reinforcements we shall require to meet the result-ing situation in the Middle East are as stated by theSecretary of State:-2 Infantry Divisions (One as a general reserve,not necessarily stationed in theMiddle East, but at short notice).1 Armoured Brigade3 Infantry BattalionsReinforcements would also be required  to Naval andAir Fortes in Palestine.All these forces would be needed for a prolonged andindefinite period.8.      We should remind the Cabinet of some of the more serious implications of finding these r einf or cements fromBritish resources:-&apos;(a) Extreme difficulty in meeting the man-power target for December,  1946,  for  all three Services, andin the case of the Army,  an obligation not onlyto defer demobilisation, but to resort to callingback men already released,(b) Difficulty in sustaining the morale of Britishtroops called upon to  take action againstArabs in support of Jews, whose terroristactivities have already inflicted upon themIrritations, insults,  hardships and casualties.(c) A total annual cost of  96,000,000 for maintaining the armed forces required in Palestine.    this figure, which does not allow for operationalexpenditure,  is  38,000,000 in excess of thecost of maintaining existing British forces inthe Middle East.-2-

S39.      presumably, it would be out of the question toaccept the first of these implications:    but there is noother way of meeting the requirement from British resources.We cannot walk back on our commitments in Germany, Indiaand elsewhere. Nor can we meet a prolonged and indefinitecommitment by short-term borrowing from Italy and Greece,since we are already r elying upon the early liquidation ofthese commitments to enable us to meet our man-power target10.      The only alternative is to ask the Americans forassistance.      We feel that the chances of obtaining american army reinforcements are slight, since the Americans are themselves experiencing difficulties in meeting their occupational commitments and the demands of public opinionfor rapid demobilisation.(Signed)    TEDDERJ.
