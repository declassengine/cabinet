THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 280.17th July, 1946.CABINET.PROGRAMME OF THE PERSIAN TUDEH PARTY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IN Persia the Tudeh (&quot; Mass &quot;) Party has. emerged as the best organised and most vocal political party. My colleagues may be interested, therefore, tosee the last published programme of the party. The programme is dated 1944and no detailed programme has been published since, but it may be expected thata new programme will be published before the forthcoming parliamentary elections.  The text of the programme forms the annex to this paper.The programme contains many praiseworthy although ill-defined proposalsfor the reform of conditions in Persia, and is designed to appeal to the progressivesections of Persian public opinion. I am sure that my colleagues will feel in sympathy with many of the objects of the Tudeh programme and will agree thatit should continue to be our policy to encourage their realisation wherever possible.This is, of course, in accord with His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s general policy in social and economic matters in the Middle East, and His Majesty&apos;s representatives in Tehran have in the past frequently urged on successive Prime Ministers- in persia the necessity of introducing such reforms.With regard to the Tudeh Party, I must point out that it must be judged by its practice and not only by its programme. Its activities in Persia have recentlygiven cause for the gravest concern. The party has been used by the Russians as their instrument in Persia for subverting the authority of the Central Govern-ment and for promoting the Secessionist Movement in Azerbaijan. The party&apos;sleaders have willingly lent themselves to this, and the success which they have achieved has been largely due to the intimidation of the Central Government bythe Soviet representatives in Tehran, and during the occupation by the soviet military Authorities in North Persia. At present the influence which the TudehParty has in the labour movement in South-West Persia is being used at Sovietinstances to undermine British influence there. I am considering as a matter of urgency means of winning the labour movement over to us.I should add that the present Persian Prime Minister has just formed a newpolitical party called the Democratic Party of Persia. This party also has a progressive programme which in the main is similar to the Tudeh Party&apos;s and goesinto rather fuller detail than does the Tudeh programme. I propose to watchprogress of this new party and to give it every encouragement if it shows itselfsincere in applying its policy of reforms.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W.1,nth July, 1946.ANNEX.Extract from the Tehran Newspaper &quot; Rahbar &quot; of the 28th February, 1944,giving the Tudeh Party Programme for the 14th Persian Parliament.THE Tudeh members of the Majlis have published their programme. Theyhave no personal interests, but have entered the Majlis to consolidate the happi-ness and protect the forgotten rights of the nation to spread the voice of Iranthroughout the country and the world and to establish, with the help of the13440   [32153]
other freedom-loving Deputies, a stronghold for the defence of the nation&apos;s rights.Of course, it cannot be expected that all the hopes of the Iranian people will be accomplished in the present session; therefore the Tudeh members have basedtheir programme on the minimum of the reforms necessary.   These are: 1. To defend to the utmost the independence of Iran and the integrity ofits soil. True independence is indissolubly linked up with economic independence.They therefore support the extension of new national industries, the acquisitionof economic and vital sources and the use of the natural resources of Iran.Economic independence is essential to political independence.2.   All Iranian soil should be in the hands of Iranians.3. &quot;Freedom for all, bread for all, education for all, hygiene for all.&quot;Freedom in its true sense should rule in this country, especially freedom of assembly. Parties should be -persona juridica. These four principles should notbe exclusive to a favoured few but within the reach of every individual.4. Strengthening of the force of the country, and protection of the peopleagainst poverty and injustice. Tudeh members will bring before the Majlisprojects for combating alcohol, opium, prostitution and venereal disease, forpecuniary help to the poor to enable them to marry, and to persons with large families, in order to further the increase of the population.5. Combating the corruption, peculation and bribery with which the countryis riddled. To this end, bread must be assured, men must be free, and education and hygiene universal. The maximum penalties for bribery and embezzlementmust be enforced, especially in the case of high officials.The following are the measures which the Tudeh members desire the Majlisto pass.  They are regarded as minimum demands :  Labour Law. To establish proper relations between employer and employed;to ensure that the worker can resist any diminution in his pay; to see that hiswages are not stopped in case of sickness, and that compensation for injury shall also be paid to him.Employment Law. The Civil Service Law is obsolete; it does not considerthe younger generation or the honest men. A radical revision, and the cancellation-tion of illogical regulations are necessary.Employees in private establishments should be assured of their future andof just treatment.Election Law. This should be revised. Tudeh oppose the project to depriveilliterates of the vote.Because of the redistribution of population the old electoral districts areno longer valid and should be revised. The number of electors in each districtshould be established before elections start, to prevent trickery.Election period should be reduced to the minimum and elections should begin and end at the same time all over the country.Judicial Reform. Abolition of special courts such as the AdministrativeCourt (Diwan-i-Kifar) and the Financial Tribunals; and revision of thecompetence of military courts.. v Total annulment of laws and regulations damaging to the country; andespecially of the wrong interpretation of article 72 of the fundamental law,which has prevented the independence of judges.Revision of the Penal and Criminal Courts Law.Simplification of Judicial Organisation Laws.Agricultural Reform. Purchase of Crown lands and large properties fromowners by Government, and handing, over of them to farmers against payment in instalments.Amendment of Agricultural Law to ensure just division of produce betweenlandlords and peasants.An improvement project spread over several years; extension of husbandryand industrialisation, enhancement of economic strength; repair of old aque-ducts and conduits and digging of new ones, generation of electric current,extension of road making and farm lands.Strengthening of National Economy. Adjustment of taxes, taking intoaccount the resources of-the majority of the nation.Reinforcement of Government monopolies. In particular, Tudeh membersoppose the sale of factories to persons when, in the decision of the 13th Majlis,such sale would be against the national interest.
Reinforcement of internal industries.Encouragement of commerce, to increase exports.Limitation of rates of profit and prevention of speculation.Amendment of Municipal Laws. Extension of municipal vote to allindividuals.Direct election.Election of Mayors by, and from among the members of, municipal councils.Extension of powers of municipal councils in drawing up their budgets,and in reforms and matters likely to secure the public interest; and also in-sblving local problems outside the competence of the Government.Education. Project for the bringing into force as soon as possible of freeuniversal education. Stress is laid on the reformation of school curricula, withregard to civic education and the fostering of the democratic spirit and truepatriotism.MilitaryReform of military organisation, leading to the formation of astrong national army to maintain internal security and the independence of Iran.Hygiene. &apos;A Bill for the extension of hygiene, especially in villages, and free medical care for poor people.Tudeh members of the Majlis will not cease their efforts to protect therights of the nation. To-day all lovers of freedom must unite and co-operatefor the happiness of Iran. The Tudeh Deputies will co-operate with all otherfreedom-loving Deputies for the reforms the nation needs.
