THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPriwted for the Cabinet.   July 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 253.1st July, 1946.CABINET.POLITICAL  BROADCASTING.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.I circulate herewith a letter from Mr. Churchill to the Prime Minister which,at the Prime Minister &apos;s request, I have had considered by the Committee on HomeInformation Services (I.H. (46) 2nd Meeting, Minute 2).2. I deal later (paragraph 5) with the precise weight which should beattached to this approach, but as will be seen Mr. Churchill thinks that politicalbroadcasting by responsible leaders of parties and figures outside party shouldbe resumed, and he is proposing to write formally to the B.B.C. and requestfacilities in the course of next month for himself. Before he writes to &quot;theB.B.C. he would like to know what the Governments attitude would be.3. The aide-memoire (CP. (46) 48), which was prepared after the lord privy Seahs discussions with the B.B.C. and which the Cabinet approved (CM.(46) 17th Conclusions, Minute 5) on the 21st February as a basis for talks withthe Opposition, did not deal directly with the situation which has now arisen,where the Opposition have taken the initiative in suggesting the resumption ofcontroversial political broadcasts. It did, however, provide that if ths B.B.C.think that facilities should be given for a broadcast on behalf of an opposition party the Government should be informed without delay of this view so that theproposal could be taken up, if desired, in consultation between the parties throughthe usual channels.4. The history of political broadcasting before the war was decidedlychequered, and it was found extremely difficult to obtain agreement between theB.B.C, the Government, the official Opposition and other political groups.Broadly, the position can be summed up in the following generalisations : (a) The B.B.C. claimed the right to choose the subject and the form ofbroadcasts on matters of political controversy, after due consultationwith the political parties. JThe political parties,.and especially theLabour Party contested this prerogative and claimed that the partiesthemselves must select the subjects and the speakers. The B.B.C.&apos;reply was that it was rarely possible to obtain prior agreement betweenthe parties for any series of political binadcasts.(b) A similar situation arose when the B.B.C. attempted to set up a politicalCommittee to advise them on the choice of subjects and speakers forcontroversial broadcasts. The B.B.C. claimed the right to appoint the members of the Committee, after due consultation with theparties; the parties claimed that they themselves must appoint theirown representatives.(c) The major parties were generally unwilling to allow independent political leaders to broadcast on controversial subjects.(d) Such decisions as have been reached by the B.B.C. on controversial broad-casting have frequently been the subject of protest by one or other of the political parties.Any of my colleagues who can spare the time will, I am sure, find itinteresting to look at the historical note on political broadcasting from 1922 to1939, which was circulated with I.H. (46) 8.   It is an illuminating story.[32046]
5. The pre-war position was somewhat confused, but the principles laiddown in the aide-memoire which were agreed with the B.B.C. and tacitly atany rate concurred in by the Opposition, and are laid down in the aide-memoireattached to OP. (46) 48, provide a good starting point for considering the widerquestion raised, by Mr. Churchill. First of all, however, are we to regardMr. Churchill&apos;s letter as a statement of his personal views and intentions, or asan official approach on behalf of the Opposition ? This is by no means clear, andthe Committee on Home Information Services thought that he should be askedto state in which capacity he was writing, and that we should stipulate that wecould only enter into discussions if he was speaking for the Conservative Party.6. As a whole I myself welcome Mr. Churchill&apos;s move, and the committee agreed that the Government could not oppose in principle the resumption of politicalbroadcasting, though there must be careful safeguards against abuse, and it would^ \ be imiDossibleto accept a situation im which the Leader of the Opposition wasI free to broadcast whenever he wanted to do so. But I am sure that, kept within reasonable bounds, the resumption of controversial political broadcasts will behealthy for our democracy. It would, in any event, be extremely difficult to resist Mr. Churchill&apos;s proposal, and, in the last resort, if it was adopted bythe B.B.C., the only method of doing so might be the use of the Governmentsveto, which would obviously be out of the question.,c 7.   The Committee accordingly recommended that  the Prime Minister, A   I should be advised to take the line that while the decision is, of course, one for%    1 the &apos;B&apos;.B.C, the Government would be prepared to discuss, through the usual&quot;channels, the detailed arrangements in connection with any broadcasts by repre-sentatives of the political parties which the B.B.C. might wish to initiate.   ThePrime Minister might say he assumes that Mr. Churchill was writing on behalfof the Conservative Party and not in his personal capacity, and if the Conserva-tive Party would like to arrange for some of the issues which arise to bediscussed the Government would be happy to meet their representatives.    A1    . tuu An     \ copy of the Prime Minister&apos;s reply might be sent to the B.B.C..i&quot;&apos;u,c &apos; 8.   As a footnote to this memorandum, I may mention that before my^ *&apos; broadcast yesterday, the B.B.C. received a message from the Opposition to theeffect that if Mr. Churchill considered that it was of a political character, hewould expect the B.B.C. to give him the right to reply.H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council,1st July, 1946.ANNEX.Copy of a letter from Mr. Churchill to the Prime Minister, dated12th June, 1946.(Private and Confidential^)Some months ago, before Christmas, when we had an informal talk aboutthe B.B.C., I gathered that it was your view that, if there were any political broadcasts of a controversial nature, there should always be an answer made.With this I agree and.I see no reason why the proportion of votes cast at theGeneral Election should not be a guide in the according of facilities to thevarious Parties, provided they have a minimum of, say, a million votes recorded.I have now come to the conclusion that political broadcasting should be resumed by responsible leaders of Parties and figures outside Party, and I amproposing to write formally to the B.B.C. and request facilities in the courseof the next month for myself.In view of the paper shortage it is not possible for speeches of leading mento be widely reported and consequently the nation is not receiving normalguidance on controversial matters. You have yourself on numerous occasionsI emphasised your reliance on free discussion, and I should like to know what&apos;&apos; \   your attitude would be before I write my letter to the B.B.C.
