(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0J? HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP, (I16)  296 COPY NO. OKCABINETINQUIRY INTO  THE PRESSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council at theic meeting on the 15th July (C.M.(h6) 68thConclusions, Minute 6),  the Cabinet authorised me to state in the course of the Broadcasting Debate that the government thought that there was a case for considering whether thereshould be any inquiry into the press on the lines of thefollowing Motion which had been put down by Governmentsupporte rs:-&quot;Newspapers, - That,  in the opinion of this house,  it is expedient that steps should be takento investigate the ownership and control of thepress:    the extent of monopolistic   tendencies inthe ownership of chains or groups of newspapers,and the influence of financial and advertisinginterests on the presentation and suppression of news.&quot;2.      As my colleagues may have seen,ray statement to this effect in the Debate roused considerable interest both inParliament and outside.      There is evidence of widespreadsupport for an inquiry and though there is also considerable opposition,  this is partly,  in my opinion,  inspired by self-interest and partly due to the mistaken impression that thefreedom of the Press is in. some way threatened.3.     At the request of the Prime Minister, I have now received a deputation from the National Union of Journalists,who originally raised the question of an inquiry in aresolution passed &quot;unanimously at their Annual GeneralMeeting.      This resolution urged that a Royal Commission onthe Press should bo appointed to inquire into the ownership,control and financing of national and provincial newspapers,news agencies and periodicals;    the extent to which thegrowth of powerful chains of newspapers is creating a monopoly of newspaper ownership;    the ability of independentnational and local newspapers and periodicals to withstandincreased competition from syndicate companies;    theinfluence of financial and advertising interests on the presentation and suppression of news;    and the distortionand suppression of essential facts in home and foreign news.The deputation from the Union elaborated the case for an inquiry, and I annex a note of the proceedings.      I thoughtmyself that the Union&apos;s statement was admirable, though perhaps it should have made the point that, while, as itrightly stressed,  the newspapers ought to voice publicopinion,  it is also their duty to resist and educate publicopinion&apos;when it Is wrong.

h.    &apos;The N.U.J.  seem to me to have made out their case, andI am satisfied that an inquiry would be in the public interest.There are a number of points - some of them old but others ofrecent development - on which, in my judgment, an investigation is called for;    and,  in particular,  there are certaintendencies which,  if not checked, may seriously interfere withthe freedom of discussion so essential to the healthy workingof our democracy.      One point which the deputation mentionedas requiring urgent attention was the extent to which the newspapers are being &quot;bought up by the chains;    they referred in particular to a number of cases where this was happening inthe West of England.      I am inclined to think that, with all its faults, our press is still the best in the world, certainlyin the larger countries, but I am sure that it will benefit from a thorough and impartial public  inquiry.      The quasi-constitutional position which it occupies as what used to becalled the Fourth Estate  is, in itself, a reason for reviewing from time to time the way in which it is dischargingits responsibilities to the public.5.      I attach great importance to the inquiry beingauthoritative and impartial;    and, at the same time, I am sure that it needs the power to call for persons and papers and to take evidence on oath.      For these reasons, I thinkthat the inquiry should be -undertaken by a Royal Commission,and it would be a groat advantage if a Judge could beappointed Chairman.      I would not exclude politicians fromthe membership - they have a valuable contribution to make,and Parliament is greatly interested in the subject - but itwould be desirable,  in my view, that the majority of the        *members should be people of independent position who obviouslyhave no political axe to grind.     With the same object, Iwould suggest that the announcement of the decision to appoint a Commission should make it quite clear that the Government&apos;sobject is to safeguard and extend, and not restrict,  thefreedom of the Press.6.      As regards scope,  the inquiry should cover both the dailyand periodical press, and also, I suggest, as advocated bythe N.U.J., the news agencies.      The suggestion has been made that it should cover news films, but since these would takethe Commission into the ramifications of the film industry,it would probably be better to exclude them.      I should haveliked to cover the grievances of the Press as regards thelibel laws, but Lord Porter&apos;s Committee on the law ofdefamation are already considering this matter,7.      The following tentative terms of reference show thescope which I have in mind:-&quot;To inquire into the ownership, management, andcontrol of the newspaper and periodical press andthe news agencies, and the law relating thereto;and to make recommendations, particularly on any steps which may be necessary to ensure the freedomof the Press, .and in the interests of free expression of opinion.&quot;8.      On timing, one possibility is that the inquiry shouldcoincide with the inquiry into.the B.B.C.,  since the two matters are related.      On the other hand, the reasons for postponing the B.B.C.  inquiry do not apply in the case of thePress, and while it is certain to be represented that, in viewof their line on the B.B.C., the Government must have some

ulterior motive if they are in a hurry to deal with the press,I can see no adequate answer to the N.U.J., and the Members ofParliament who have put their names to the Motion.      There is,of course,  no great urgency, but I should like to see theCommission set up in the course of the present year.9.      I accordingly recornmend. that, as soon as convenient, a royal Commission into the press on the lines I have indicatedshould be set up, and that&apos;Parliament and the N.U.J.  should beinformed at once of this desired intention, preferably beforethe Recess.(Intld.)    H.M.Privy Council Office, S.W.1.25TH JULY, 19h6ANNEXNote of deputation from theNational Union of Journalists received by theLord President of the &quot;Council&quot; on the&quot;2&quot;2nd July, 19h6The deputation consisted of Mr. Fred Treavett, president,Mr. Ernest Jay, Vic e-President, Mr. E.J.T. Didymua, Hon.&apos;Treasurer, Mr. P. Fullerton Brestard, Organising Secretary,Mr. C.-J. Bundock, General Secretary.Mr. Bundock, General Secretary of the Union said:.    it wasnecessary at the ou-tset to put one thing beyond any possibilityof doubt.      They were not concerned with the interests of airypolitical party or movement.      In. their ranks they hadrepresentatives of all schools of thought.      Any partisanshipwould be the negation of their purpose, for as journaliststhey wore concerned only that the best possible supply of factand news about national and international affairs should be atthe disposal of the people,  that they might form their judgment on sound knowledge and. should be well and truly informed.Did the present tendencies in newspaper production move to that end?      That was the question for the inquiry.      Itwould be harmful to the public interest should anything likeestrangement appear between the House of representatives ofthe people and the organs of the press, which should be thevoice of the people.The free right of criticism must be maintained.      A healthypublic opinion depended on it.     Any tampering with the freedomof expression would be an infringement of the sovereign rightsof the people.      On their side the N.U.J. admitted the equalimportance of a full and frank conveyance of fact and an impartial presentation of news.      Complete freedom of expression in the editorial columns and complete anddisinterested presentation, of affairs in the news columns was,they considered, the correct balance.

If that were a fair statement of the privilege and responsibility of a well conducted, newspaper they ought toconsider it in the light of the difficult problem of monopoly.The freedom of the press they claimed from the Government ofthe day must not be choked by the concentration of thecountry&apos;s newspapers in the hands of two or three powerfulcommercial groups.In past days each town or area had its independentlyowned newspaper or perhaps two or three of varying politicalcolours, and out of the clash of opposing views vigorouslyexpressed emerged a valuable index to the state of publicopinion.      The papers of those days had a dignity and tonenot compatible with the stunting and sensationalism that had become too popular in these days and which was largely the outcome of the quest for huge circulations.Now they saw provincial papers, morning, evening, andweekly, disappearing and.,  even more serious, one paper after another throughout the country, weeklies as well as dailies,being brought within the control of one or other of the dominant newspaper owning groups.      They olid, not feel itnecessary to ascribe to press magnates sinister designs.The trade unions enjoyed, excellent relations with some of them.How much freedom had the editor of one of a chain ofgroup newspapers in the control of his own journal?     Hodoubt the degree of liberty varied from group to group. AIf a whole string of papers from North to South and from east to West was engaged day by day and week by week inechoing the views of a newspaper magnate, that was not healthy.How far (if at all) was news suppressed or manipulated toserve a particular point of view in national or international affairs?Vi/ere papers throughout the. country instructed whether to report prominent men and women, or what amount of attentionto give them according to some propaganda plan decided in thecentral office of the group?Did advertising and financial interests exercise anyinfluence over the editorial contents of a paper?They were some of the questions that must assumeimportance at a Royal Commission and they could be answeredsatisfactorily only by a body which had full power.The Rational Union of Journalists spoke for the vast majority of those engaged in. one of the principal crafts ofthe great newspaper industry, and it urged the necessity ofa thorough investigation into the structure, standards and organisation of the British newspaper industry.      Monopolyownership must be an important question, but they wished toemphasise that it was by no means the only question.Mr. Bundock quoted from the Union&apos;s code of professionalconduct and added,  &quot;But it is important to remember that thegreat majority of journalists are employed persons and it isimportant that these principles be accepted and applied bythe newspaper proprietors and. executives.&quot;

Monopoly ownership must he an important question in the inquiry for which they asked, hut they wished to emphasise that it is by no means the only question.      They asked fora Royal Commission which could take evidence on oath, summonwitnesses and order the production of documents, and reporton ways and means of safeguarding and enlarging the freedomof the press.      They thought it was a necessity in thepresent state of national development.Mr. Herbert Morrison said, &quot;I am very glad that you as representing the Rational Union of Journalists have made itabundantly clear that you have no wish to restrict thefreedom of the press.      Certainly neither I nor His Majesty&apos;sGovernment could be a party to any interference with the traditional liberty of the press.You have expressed your concern at the developments ofnewspaper combines and chains of newspapers which,  in yourjudgment, tend to destroy the liberty of the journalist;the liberty of the individual journalist is of course one ofthe elements of the liberty of the press.     Many people areapprehensive as to the mixture of views and news with the   *-consequence, it is alleged, that the news columns are not always as impartial as they should be.I have a recollection of the famous CP.  Scott of the&quot;Manchester Guardian&apos;  once saying,   &apos;Pacts are sacred butcomment is free&apos;.      There would be much to be said for thatadmirable statement being hung up.in every newspaper office.I will report your representations to the Prime Ministerand my colleagues in the Government.     As you will appreciate,I am not in a position today to say whether the Governmentwill institute any inquiry or not.      If such an inquiry shouldbe instituted it would have as its object furthering and makingwider and more genuine the freedom of the British Press.&quot;
