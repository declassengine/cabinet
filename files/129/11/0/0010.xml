(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&quot; S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.   (46) 3605TH JULY.  1946COPY NO.    6^cabinet proposed NEW POLICY FOR Cyprus memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies wish to consult the Cabinet on a statement aboutCyprus which I am proposing to make in my speech on theColonial Office Vote on Tuesday, the 9th July.2. The situation in Cyprus has for some time   past beenunsatisfactory.      I may briefly recall that in 1931 there were serious riots in the Colony fermented by agitators who desired to see the Island united with Greece.      These riotsculminated in the burning down of Government House and order was only restored by the arrival of warships.      After theseevents, some drastic   measures were thought necessary by the then Government.      The leaders of the agitation were deported,representative institutions were abrogated and a number of very stringent laws were introduced restricting the freedomof political self-expression.Though there has been some relaxation in recentyears,  this method of government in general still persistsand the Island has no constitution which affords theadministration a channel of consultation with elected representatives of the Islanders.The Enosis, or !lUnion with Greece&quot;, Movement has for long been the main political cry In the Island;    butrecently, in addition to this,  there has developed a rapid and dangerous spread    of Communism,      A strong CommunistParty has been formed    under the leadership of a Cypriottrained in Russia and this organisation is conducting a campaign with growing vehemence, which has allied Communistdoctrines with the demand for union with Greece,      In therecent Municipal elections this party has emerged as the dominant force.      The Governor has repeatedly warned me thatwe are drifting into a serious situation and has pressed strongly for a firm announcement to be made that it is theintention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to   keep the Islandunder British sovereignty.     During the last   year therehave been continual statements that union with Greece isfavoured by the British Government,  and the fact that theserumours have so far remained uncontradicted by an authoritative statement is having grave effects on local opinion.      The   Cypriot officials upon whom the administration has largely to rely are reported to be wavering in their loyalty and to be trimming their sails for the expectedchange.      We have a substantial body of opinion in the island in our favour including that of the Turkish minority, butthe Governor feels that we shall lose these friends unless we can encourage them by some firm statement of our intentions.

4i3. I therefore propose in my statement in the House on tuesday to make it clear that His Majesty&apos;s Government haveno intention of transferring&apos; the Island from british sovereignty.      I do not think chat my colleagues willrequire me to go deeply into the arguments for declaring that Cyprus shall remain a part of the British Empire.We took over the Island, in 1878 as a protected territoryfrom Turkey and on the outbreak of war with Turkey inNovember 1914,  it became a British Colony.      It is todaythe only country in the Middle East which is    under british sovereignty,      Greece has no such historical claimto Cyprus as she had to the Dodecanese.      We have some duty to the loyal Greek Cypriote as well as to the minority of turkish Cypriots who have s^ood by us for nearly seventyyears.      Prom the defence standpoint,  the matter has beenconsidered by the Chiefs of Staff who ha&quot;&quot;e strongly advised that the Island should be retained, and.    it is unnecessary to dwell on the reasons which exist at present for accepting this view.      Moreover,  there is obvious objection toopening up the question of cession of British territoryfrom a general point of view.      If once we talked of handingCyprus over to Greece,  it would give encouragement to the presentation of a number of   claims elsewhere for thetransfer of territory from British sovereignty. -4. But I feel that I must go further than this andthat I cannot take my stand on a negative policy.      I am advised that, provided that a firm statement is made, the   .time has come when it would be good policy to announce theinstitution of a more liberal regime in the internal affairs of the Island.   -   I therefore propose that my announcement should be accompanied by a further statement that steps willbe taken to set up a Consultative Assembly from allrepresentative elements to consider the drawing up of a newConstitution which will give Cypriots, subject to certainsafeguards, an effective say in local affairs.      I am advised that the establishment of a bod;/ of this kind will act as a valuable safety valve and will assist in rallying opinion to our side.A further point on which I shall lay stress is our intention to embark upon a large scale scheme for thedevelopment of the Island and for the improvement of itssocial services.      I have already in my possession a systematic and detailed ten ^rear development plan drawn upby a team of experts.      The money required to finance this plan,  in addition to that available from local resources andon local credit, will be provided, from the colonial development and Welfare Fund.      I also propose that this new regime should be marked by a relaxation of some of themore oppressive measures which have existed since the riotsof 1931.      Among these I propose that certain laws which wereenacted to restrict the freedom of the local Orthodox Churchin the election of an Archbishop should be rescinded in thehope that the Cyprus Church will freely choose a candidate for the Archiepiscopal throne which has been vacant for manyyears.      I am advised that this step should have a salutary effect upon local opinion.      I also propose that the persons,now numbering thirteen, who were deported after the riots of1931 should,  if they wish, be permitted to return to the island.      I shall also consider whether,  in certain lesserrespects,  some of the restrictive legislation can besoftened.

5. I hope that this new policy will commend itselfto my colleagues.      I am convinced that the positionin Cyprus cannot he allowed *b   remain as    it iswithout grave risk, not merely to the local british administration, hut to our general position in theMiddle East.      A firm policy with regard to thequestion of. cession to any foreign power,  combined with a more liberal attitude in domestic mattersappears to me to offer the best prospect of a solutionof&quot;our difficulties at the present time.G. H, H.Colonial Office, S.W. 1.5TH JULY,   1946.
