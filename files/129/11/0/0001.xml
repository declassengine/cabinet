THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  June 1946.Copy No.CABINET.DESPATCH OF CABINET AND CABINET COMMITTEE business during THE SUMMER RECESS.Note by the Prime Minister.IN the interests of efficiency I am anxious that all Ministers and senior officials should have a reasonable spell of uninterrupted holiday during the summer Recess. To this end I propose that during the six weeks from the5th August to the 16th September there should be no meetings of the StandingMinisterial Committees of the Cabinet and that the Cabinet itself should meetas rarely as possible.2. I therefore ask all Ministers to consider forthwith whether there are any matters on which they will have to obtain decisions from the Cabinet or froma Cabinet Committee before the middle of September, and to make every effort to bring these matters forward for consideration before the end of July.3. I recognise that certain questions may arise during this period,particularly in the field of foreign affairs, which will have to be submitted forthe collective decision of Ministers. I hope, however, that the occasions whenMinisters will have to be called together may be kept to a minimum; and withthis in view I propose that urgent business which would ordinarily have beenhandled by a Cabinet Committee should be dealt with in this period by the cabinet itself if it should be meeting for other purposes. If, therefore, any such businessshould arise during the period the 5th August to the 16th September, the Ministeiconcerned should communicate with the Cabinet Secretariat, who will advise howit can best be handled.4. The Cabinet Secretariat will make the usual arrangements to ensure thata nucleus of Ministers will be readily available for any meetings of the Cabinetwhich may have to be held.C. R. A.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,28th June, 1946.SECRET.CP. (46) 251.28th June, 1946.[92331]
