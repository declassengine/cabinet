This document is the property of His Britannic Majesty&apos;s GovernmentPrinted for the Cabinet, July, 1946SECRETCP. (46) 271 [Revise)23rd July, 1946CABINETADMISSION OF COLOURED PERSONS INTO THE armed forces OF THE UNITED kingdom memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. The Colonial Secretary in his Paper (CP. (46) 278) is asking for agreement tothe principle that coloured persons, being British subjects or British protected persons,should be allowed to enter the Armed Forces of the Crown, and should be as eligiblefor commissioning as those of European descent.2. Although the Army Act makes provision for the enlistment of coloured persons,it gives the Army Council power to make regulations governing enlistment. Before thewar the Recruiting Regulations for the British Army laid down that civilians wishing to enlist under normal Regular Army engagements had to be British subjects, the sonsof British subjects, and of pure European descent. Commanding Officers were unwilling to accept coloured persons in their units, because they feared that there would be considerable objection and friction between coloured and white persons, and the regulation excluding them was made in order to avoid such individual rejections.Coloured persons were, therefore, enlisted only in Colonial Forces.3. Under the Act of Settlement, there is no power to grant commissions to aliens.Further, by regulations for admission to the Royal Military College, candidates for permanent Regular Army commissions had to be British subjects, sons of Britishsubjects and of pure European descent.4. The Government decided in 1939 that, during the war, the rules regardingEuropean descent should be waived and coloured personnel could be enlisted and granted emergency commissions. In effect this meant that some coloured persons wereenlisted in the British Army. But of the very few to be granted King&apos;s Commissions, all were accepted for service with Colonial troops, except a very small number of doctors(about a dozen).5. The granting of King&apos;s Commissions to coloured persons confers the power of command not only over troops of the same nationality as themselves, but also over british personnel serving in the same force; and it should be noted that British personnel in Colonial Forces are volunteers. On the other hand, a form of King&apos;s commission could be devised which would not give command over British troops, or, alternatively,the powers inherent in normal King&apos;s Commissions could be restricted by King&apos;sRegulations, but this would not, of course, meet the main point that the colonial secretary has in mind.6. The Colonial Secretary argues that coloured personnel should be allowed toserve in the forces because during the course of any year very few applicants wouldbe successful in passing the test for admission, namely, residence in the U.K. at thetime of application and the attainment of the requisite standards, and further, thatadmission of so few coloured men could make no appreciable difference to the efficiencyor well-being of these forces. To accept the principle of entry and then turn downcandidates on an administrative ground, i.e., not attaining the required standards, mightwell do more to upset the feelings of the coloured people than refusal to accept theprinciple in the first place. As an instance, the coloured university graduate mighthave greatly distinguished himself at a university both at games and academically. Hewould then apply for a university commission, and to reject his candidature would revivethe colour bar controversy in an even more acute form. The result would be renewedpressure on the War Office to admit coloured persons freely, and, the principle havingbeen accepted, this pressure would be very difficult to resist.Copy No.38
z7. The unrestricted enlistment of coloured men in British regiments would be an experiment, the success of which would be doubtful. They would form a small minority in any unit, and their life would probably not be a very happy one. The presence ofa few coloured families in the married quarters would introduce dangerous complica-tions into what ought to be a smoothly integrated social group. There would be a riskof incidents which would do great harm to the unit itself and to relations between Britishmen and coloured people generally.8. But, undoubtedly, the most dangerous of these proposals is the commissioningof coloured persons to command British troops. Some of the arguments against accept-ance of this principle are set out in paragraph 4 of CP. (46) 278. A point to whichI attach great importance is the fostering of close relations between officers andmen. The officer both in peace and war must gain the confidence of his men. Theymust feel that the officer not only is their leader but has their welfare at heart and willunderstand and help them in their problems and difficulties however intimate. the welfare side of administration will become even more important when dealing with theyoung conscript of 18 years when his training and career in civil life is interrupted. the domestic problems of the British soldier are often such that he would be very unwilling to confide in a coloured officer, and, even if he were, that officer would usually beunfitted to advise him and help him handle them. While the British soldier is quickto acknowledge and admire leadership and courage wherever he finds it, he, and moreparticularly his womenfolk, are still very conservative in their outlook on such matters.He is unlikely to accept a coloured officer as his commander unless long experience hasconvinced him of such an individual^ fitness for command. It is unlikely that he willever accept him on account of the different upbringing and outlook on life as a person on whom he can rely upon to assist him in his personal difficulties and troubles. Thiswill mean that, however able a coloured officer may be, he is bound to go through a long period of probation, during which there is likely to be a number of small incidents whichwill wound his self-esteem, shake his self-confidence and embitter his racial feelings.9. The proposal constitutes a threat to discipline, to the unquestioning confidencewhich men should be able to have in their officers and to the family atmosphere ofBritish regiments; and however small the number of entrants, such a threat cannot be ignored. If the unit or units affected thereby became unfit for active service becausethese sources of strength had been weakened, their ill-repute in the Army wouldexacerbate those racial feelings which this well-meant experiment is intended to soothe.10. There is grave danger in placing British soldiers under the command of colouredpersons in the stress of battle. In wartime there are frequent changes of personnelwithin units and there is thus no time for a long period of probation during which thetroops might learn to trust their coloured officers. The first question to be asked of anyArmy reformer is, how will his proposals work on active service ? If they cannot passthis test, they cannot be entertained. In this case, it is suggested that the answer is,at least, doubtful, and the risk of a breakdown cannot be ignored. Coloured officersmight, or might not, be successful in action, and there is no justification for a gamblein which men&apos;s lives are at stake.11. The Colonial Secretary reports that the Air Ministry have agreed to accept inprinciple the admission of coloured persons into the R.A.F. and their commissioningin suitable cases. It is, of course, for the Air Council to decide what policy is best suited to the needs of the R.A.F., but it by no means follows that the same policy would suit the Army. The functions of commissioned officers are not identical in thetwo Services and their relations with other ranks are, no doubt, different. In particular,the R.A.F. officer does not ordinarily have frequent occasion to lead his men personallyinto battle, and this, as is explained above, must be the Army&apos;s overriding consideration in the selection of officers.12. To describe the exclusion of coloured persons from the British Army as an example of the colour bar is an undue simplification of the problem. Service in theBritish Army is not one of the rights of man, nor indeed of British subjects. certain british citizens, for example when one of the parents is not a British born subject, arenot allowed to enlist into the Army (nor indeed into some of the civil departments ofGovernment). Moreover, it is the accepted policy of the Army Council that men should be commanded by officers having the same territorial connections as themselves with some part of the British Isles, e.g., that Scottish troops should be commanded byScottish officers. The posting of coloured officers would be an extreme departure fromthis policy. To confine admittance to the Army&apos;s ranks to a restricted group of candi-dates is quite natural and sensible, for it is a highly specialized community with a longhistory and organized to perform a function which at once demands and severely testsa very close integration between officers and men. It is natural that the Armed Forcesof any one nation should resent being led by men of other nations, especially when
they are likely to be of very different temperament, outlook and social background.I cannot agree to accept a policy that would outrage this natural sentiment, which is,at present, a source of strength to British Arms.13. To sum up, the enlistment of coloured men into the Army, and a fortiori, thegrant of commissions in the British Army to them, constitutes, in my view,a threat to the discipline and well-being of the Army which might be a veryserious matter in time of war. The limitation of the numbers of entrants is no answer to this since it will be very difficult, if not impossible, to limit numbers by administrative action once the principle is admitted, and any attempt to do so is likely to undowhatever good to the cause of improved relations with the coloured peoples that thisexperiment might do. Distrust of coloured men as commanders may be a prejudice;but this prejudice is nonetheless a fact which cannot be ignored in assessing the fitnessof the Army for its primary duty, which is waging war.J- J- L.(b46/13)   120   7/46   w.o.p.   26090
