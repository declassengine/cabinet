-    110(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY CP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVIilRlTMENT) -,-SECRETCP. (46)  285 COPY NO. -&quot;    19th July.  1946CABINETRELAXATION OP THE BAN ON MARRIAGESBETWLSN BRITISH SERVICEMEN AND ALIIiK WOMENJoint Memorandum by the Home secretary and the Secretary of State for War1. In CP. (46) 211 dated 34th May, 1946, theSecretary of State for War stated that frequentrepresentations had been made and pressed by Membersof Parliament and others that marriages should be permitted between British Servicemen and alien women andre commended that the present ban on marriage between BritishServicemen and alien women, other than Japanese, should be relaxed if the reasons for such marriage are good and provided. .there is no security objection.The meeting which considered this paper invited theHome Secretary to discuss the implications of this  commendation with ministerial representatives of theService Departments, the Foreign Office,  the dominions office and the Control Office for Germany and Austria, andto submit revised proposals for consideration by theCab inet.These discussions have now taken place and there commendations of the Ministers concerned are set. out inparagraph 1-3 below.     Particular attention is drawn to paragraph 12 which puts forward a proposal that the ban-on marriages between British Servicemen and German women should be relaxed on the  same conditions as are proposed for marriages with other alien women except Japanese.   ,2. The present position is that both in B.A.C.R.  and .M.F. , General Routine Orders are in force forbiddingBritish Servicemen from, contracting marriages with German,or Austrian subjects.      In very special circumstances,permission may be granted to British ex-prisoners of war to^marryAustrian     women   to whom they became engaged prior to their liberation.      Copies of the relevant portions of theB.A.O.R.  and C.M.F. General Routine Orders on this matterare appended in Annexes I and II respectively.3. Applications are being received in the War Office,through Members of parliament&apos;, for marriages with german or Austrian subjects, but are refused where the banclearly applies.      Other than this method, directapplication.;:; to either G.H.Q. , B.A.O.R., or G.H.Q., CM.P.,for permission to marry a German or Austrian would bepurposeless save whore, an exception is permissible in thecase of an Austrian subject as mentioned in paragraph above.      A man would of course have to apply in the firsttl -instance to his Commanding Officer, but no approval couldbe given without War Office sanction.

4;* It is understood that there has been no instance ofthese orders being deliberately disobeyed.5. The Question of the legality of the ban on marriageshas been submitted to the Law Officers of tho Crown whosoopinion is that the military orders banning marriages betweenmemb e r s of H i a M a .j e s t y1 s Forces an d w omen of e no my &apos;nationality are lawful..      They consider that whilst theoccupation of Germany remains substantially on its present basis,  the marriage ban,  if questionable in the ordinaryCourts at. all, would be regarded as a proper exercise ofthe prerogative powers.There appears to the Law Officers to be no doubt,however? but that marriages contracted in breach of theban would be perfectly valid.6* At tho Meeting of Ministers under the chairmanship of the Home Secretary the following questions wereconsiderodeTo would it be expedient to retain the ban until the nationality law has been so amended as to ensure that maalien woman on&apos;marriage to a British subject shall not automatically acquire British nationality?      If as is hoped the agreement of the Dominion Governments is secured on thispoint, amending legislation relating to the nationality of married women might be introduced at a comparatively earlydate;    but any amendment of the law on this subject win nodoubt be  so framed as to enable a foreign woman shortly aftermarriage to a British subject to apply for british nationality,  and to authorise the Home Secretary to grant hera certificate of naturalisation if he is satisfied that sheis not an undesirable person.     Apart,  therefore, fromexceptional cases when information is forthcoming to showthat a woman is undesirable, the foreign women, whom british soldiers marry will quickly be able to acquire british nationality oven if the law is amended.8. Moreover, even if marriage did not automaticallyconfer British nationality       the ffife,  it would beunjustifiable for the Home Secretary to refuse to admitto the United Kingdom a foreign woman who had married aBritish soldier and wished to live with him in this country,unless there were clear evidence that she is of undesirablecharacter.      So far, therefore, as concerns the admissioninto and settlement&apos;in the United Kingdom of these foreignwives, the Question whether the nationality law is or is notamended is irrelevant.,     Whether a foreign woman on marriageto a British subject does or does not automatically acquireBritish nationality,  it will be necessary to admit her tothis country in the absence of some clear reason forregarding her as undesirable.9. Contrasts can be drawn between the favourable position granted to a foreign woman who marries a british subject and as a consequence is given the right to settle inthis country, and the treatment of other foreigners, manyof whom are not allowed to settle here, even if they have fought on the Allied side;    and use- can no doubt be made ofsuch - contrasts for the purpose of pressing the Government to

adopt a more liberal policy in the matter of the admissionof foreigners to this country.      There has, however, beena progressive relaxation of our immigration policy, eg.it has recently been decided that the foreign husbands&quot;ofBritish born women shall,  as a general rule, be allowedto settle in the United Kingdom provided they arepersonally suitable;    and the fact that a control must heexercised over the entry into this country of foreignerswhere the object is to obtain employment here or to findeasier conditions of life is not a reason for puttingObstacles in the way of marriage between British subjects and foreign women.      In. the administration of the aliens act a clear distinction has always been drawn between entry to the United Kingdom for the. purpose of marriage toBritish subjects and entry for other purposes.      Thepower of controlling immigration has never been used forthe purpose of hindering a foreign woman from entering theUnited Kingdom to marry a British subject unless the womanwas known to be undesirable10. Our conclusion,  therefore, is that considerationsrelating to the nationality law and considerations relatingto immigration policy ought not to be regarded asobjections to a relaxation of the marriage ban,  if on merits such relaxation is desirable11. The remaining objection to the &apos; relaxation of theban is based on security cons iderations.      This matter wasconsidered at the meeting of Ministers, and it was generally agreed that to allow members of the British Forces tomarry alien women could not in itself be regarded as aserious threat to security.      As is explained inparagraph 3 of the Secretary of State for War&apos;s paper g.P.(4G)   211,  a strict security check will be applied ineach individual case      It is arguable indeed that theillicit relationships which are liable to develop underthe operation of a ban on marriages constitute a greaterthreat to security than a permitted marriage.12. In several respects moreover the ban operates tothe detriment of good discipline.     As is indicated inparagraph 6 above,  a marriage contracted in breach of theban remains valid,  and disciplinary measures to prevent or to punish such breaches are unlikely to be effectivewhere the parties are. determined on marriage.      Furthermore,it is administratively impracticable to allow exceptions tothe ban in &quot;very special cases&quot;, eg.  in. order tolegitimise a child,  since to do so produces the sociallyundesirable effect of multiplying very special cases ofthis kind.  &apos;  For these reasons the Mooting of ministers agreed With a proposal by the Secretary of State for war that marriages with German women should bo permitted onthe same terms as are proposed for marriages with otheralien women except Japanese13. We accordingly recommend that approval should begiven to the following proposals put forward by theSecretary of State for War,  i.e(a)    Local military commanders to be &apos; authorised to relax the present &quot;ban on marriage between Britishservicemen and alien women,  other than Japanese,if the reasons are good and providing there is noae cur ity ohjection;

(b)    The continuance of the ban on marriage between Britishservicemen and Japanese women.14. If the above recommendations are approved,  it isproposed that the Americans should be informed of our intention,  since  the original policy of non-fraternisation wasconcerted with them.tT.CE.tl * (J .
