(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HI3 BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (kS)   272 &apos; . COPY NO.    ?A15TH JULY.   19U6CABINETAIR COMMUNICATIONS WITH EASTERN europe and THE. BALKANSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs am greatly disturbed by the prospect of the early and complete interruption of our air communications with certainEastern European and Balkan capitals resulting from theapplication of the demobilisation programme to the personnel of R.A.P.  Transport Command.2.      The capitals concerned are Warsaw, Belgrade, Budapest,Bucharest and Sofia.    Our air services to these constitute an indispensable link on which we depend for all contact with ourdiplomatic and military missions in the countries concerned,for the despatch of publicity material, both political and commercial,  and for the interchange of visits,  official and otherwise.3.      This connection has hitherto been maintained by R.A.P.Transport Command which operates on an ad hoc basis of the clearance of each individual aircraft.     I am informed, however,that,  even on the assumption that no military emergency arises in the Middle East or India,  the services will have to closedown entirely by 15th September and are to be thinned out between now and that date.    The reason for this is the progressive demobilisation of air crews.    I understand thatthe Air Ministry will do their best to arrange for the services to Belgrade, Budapest and Sofia to be continued until15th August but they cannot give a definite assurance even ofthis,  and the frequencies of the services will anyhow have- tobe reduced.    The Warsaw and Budapest services can be operateduntil 1st September at their present frequency.    None of thefive services can be taken over by the European Division ofBritish Overseas Airways Corporation as soon as they arerelinquished by the R.A.. P.    The position is that,  according totheir present plans,  the Corporation could operate daily toWarsaw as from October and at an unspecified frequency to Belgrade,Budapest, Bucharest and Sofia as; from January 1947.    Even this,however, would depend on obtaining&apos; the necessary authorisationsfrom the Polish and Yugoslav Governments and from the allied control Commissions at Bucharest, Budapest and Sofia,  and Ithink that the chances of obtaining the necessary permissionsare insignificant.    The policy of the Polish provisional Governmentseems to be to discourage any &quot;/estern European aircraft,  especiallycivil aircraft,  from crossing their frontiers and the latest information from Belgrade shows that the Yugoslav Government areonly prepared to admit our courier aircraft on a. most precariousbasis.    As regards the countries under Russian occupation our prospects of securing permission for regular civil flights areeven less promising.

4.      It therefore seems clear that unless something drasticis done we may be faced with a complete cessation of our air communications with these five capitals in August - September.This means that we should have no speedy or safe means oftransport to them at all for official material (includingthe very important publicity material) or personnel.    for transport by road-or rail would not only be exceedingly slow,but inefficient and uncertain and completely at the mercy ofthe local authorities.    I am sure my colleagues v/ill agreethat the political consequences of such a cessation would bemore than lamentable and I suggest that the Cabinet should invite the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister of CivilAviation to form a special unit for the purpose of operatingthese services.    The unit would either hove to be military orto be operated by B. O.A.C.   crews in uniform.    Under such anarrangement we should be able to continue operating on thepresent ad hoc basis without needing to approach the Polish and Yugoslav Governments or the&apos;Allied Commissions concerned..E.B.Foreign Office,  S.W.1,15TH JULY,  192+6.-2-
