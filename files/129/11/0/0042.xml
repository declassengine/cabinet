SECRET. copy  NOtCP. (46) 292.23rd July, 1946.CABINET.GERMANY : RESULTS OF THE PARIS DISCUSSIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Conclusions and Recommendations.WE should immediately accept in principle the American offer that theUnited States and the British zones of Germany should be treated as a singleeconomic unit in order to reduce the financial and economic burden on the occupying Powers, and we should study urgently with the Americans the meansof putting this arrangement into practice.2. We should make it clear to the French and to the Russians that it is open for them to join this inter-zonal system at any moment as soon as they accept the principle of treating Germany as an economic whole and are preparedto put this into practice. We should make it clear to them that this is not a first step towards dividing Europe into two. .3. A memorandum (Annex B) should be communicated to the Russian,French and American Governments setting out the British point of view asregards the Potsdam Agreement in relation to the treatment of Germany as aneconomic unit and to reparations.4. Publicity should be given to the evidence in our possession that russia is breaking the Potsdam Agreement by continuing to produce war material inthe Russian zone of Germany. A formal statement of this evidence, with a renewal of the proposal for a Commission to visit all four zones and investigatesuch allegations on the spot, should be made by the British Commander-in-Chiefsome time before the next meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers on germany.13453   [32181]bPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1946.
Memorandum.I attach as Annex A a synopsis of the discussions in Paris about Germanyand Austria. I intend in the present paper to deal with the resulting situation as regards German questions and the steps which should be taken at once.Consideration is also being given to other long-term questions which were raised and I shall circulate another paper upon them in due course. Very briefly theresults are that the Russians have refused to agree to implement the basicprovisions of the Potsdam Agreement relating to the treatment of Germany asan economic whole and in particular to the equitable distribution of indigenousresources. I made a declaration to the effect that if it was impossible to obtain agreement about treating Germany as an economic whole His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would have to reorganise the British zone, in co-operation with any otherzones which would reciprocate, in such a way as to relieve the British taxpayerof his present liability for expenditure on Germany. Mr. Byrnes made an offer to the effect that the American zone would co-operate with any other zone thatwas willing to do so in such a way as to form an economic unit &quot;out of the two orthree zones so co-operating. This offer was renewed by the American Commander-in-Chief at a meeting of the Allied Control Council&apos; on the 20th July. GeneralMacNarney emphasised that the American object was to arrest the economicparalysis of Germany and to abolish the division of Germany into air-tightcompartments. The arrangements would be open on. equal terms to the repre-sentatives of ail other occupying Powers at any time they are prepared toparticipate. The United States Government hoped by this proposal to expedite the treatment of Germany as an economic unit.2.   The Russian contribution to the debate had two curious features :  (a) M. Molotov said that economic unity should be achieved by allowingGermany to build up her industry and to establish foreign trade relations, subject to four-Power control over German industry ingeneral and over the Ruhr industry in particular. He indicated that subject to the establishment of such control he would have noobjection to the development of peaceful German industries evenabove the level agreed in the Level of Industry Plan.(b) On the other hand, M. Molotov repeated the old Russian claim to10 billion dollars&apos; wTorth of reparations from Germany which was originally raised at the Yalta Conference and which we thought hadbeen disposed of in the subsequent reparations negotiations and inthe Potsdam Agreement, which makes no mention of a figure for thetotal of German reparations. M. Molotov&apos;s remarks can only betaken to mean that the Russians intend to go on taking not onlycapital equipment but also continuing deliveries from current Germanproduction until the figure of 10 billion dollars&apos; worth has beenreached. This would involve Russian control of the German industries in their zone for a very long period and would completely upset thebasis of the Level of Industry Plan. M. Molotov appeared toindicate that the Soviet Government claimed reparation from thecurrent production of the Western zones as well as from the Russianzone (which would be flatly contrary to the Potsdam Agreement).But it seems not unlikely that what he is really aiming at is that industry in the west of Germany should be stripped of equipment and the standard of living there still further depressed, whileindustry in the east is built up under Russian control in order toprovide continuing deliveries for Russia and at the same time tosuggest that conditions are better in the Russian zone than in the otherzones.3. We have now to consider firstly what would be involved in reorganisingthe British zone so as to reduce the burden falling on the British taxpayer, and secondly what answer to make to the American offer to co-operate by treating theBritish and American zones as one economic unit. On the first point the british zone by itself could, in a fairly short time, be made far more economically viablethan it is at present, provided that all exports sent outside the British zone, eveninto other zones of Germany, were paid for immediately in dollars, and thatsubstantially more coal were retained in the British zone to restore the general level of production both of coal and of other goods. The sufferers from both theseconditions would in the short run be the Western European Powers and America,and not Russia.   There are thus obvious political objections to this course.
4. As regards the second point, some elucidation has been obtained of the implications of the American offer, by means of informal conversations betweenthe British and American authorities in Germany. It appears that the american authorities contemplate that:- (a) Joint German administrations should be set up for the two zones for food and agriculture, trade, industry and finance. These would be super-imposed on the existing German bodies in the two zones. Anglo-American staffs would exist alongside them and exercise control. Thejoint German bodies would, to begin with, represent more an asso-ciation of existing bodies than a complete merger.(&amp;) The joint German bodies would not all meet in the same place, but some in the British zone and some in the American, in order not to give theimpression that a new capital of Western Germany was being estab-lished. There is no question at present of fusing the zones politically.This would in any case be impracticable for the time being because ofthe different methods of political control exercised.We shall need to approach the Americans with some care on the subject ofsharing the deficits on the balances of payments of the two zones, but there is agood hope that in practice a reasonably satisfactory solution of this question could be found as part of a general arrangement for co-operation between the two zones. As regards the pooling of imports and the establishment of a commonration standard, it seems that the Americans would be willing to set up a commonbasic ration of, say, 1,500 calories, and that imports necessary to maintain thisshould be pooled through a German central agency.5. The addition of the American zone to the British would not mean that wecould immediately achieve as great reduction of the unfavourable balance ofpayments than if we were organising the British zone by itself. But to treat the two zones as a unit would certainly enable us to make some improvement ascompared with the present situation, and would hold out great hopes for future economic development, subject to the same proviso as that made above that morecoal was retained in Germany. (It must be borne in mind that the americans would probably be less inclined than ourselves to made concessions to the interestsof the smaller Western European Powers.)6. On either hypothesis, in order to make certain that the burden nowfalling on the British taxpayer was not only reduced in the short run butcompletely eliminated in the long run, we should have to modify the Level ofIndustry Agreement. Since Germany is not being treated as an economic whole,we are entitled to do this. This matter would form an important part of anyfurther discussions with the American authorities. The discussions should inparticular cover the questions as to what action we should take with regard tothe dismantlement of plants and the delivery of equipment as reparation fromthe Western zone, and whether we should stop delivering plant to the Russiansonly while continuing deliveries, down to a certain level, to the Western Powers.We should thus be taking the action on which the O.R.C. agreed at its9th Meeting on the 21st June. In discussing this question with the Americans,we would naturally bear in mind the essential need of British industry for certainparticular immediate deliveries of reparation plant.7. As between the two alternatives of reorganising our own zone by itself in order to reduce the burden oh the British taxpayer and of accepting theAmerican offer of co-operation, the balance seems to lie clearly in favour of thelatter, particularly in view of the following considerations. It is now public knowledge that the Americans put this idea forward in Paris, and have reiteratedtheir offer in Berlin. We fully share the reasons underlying the american proposals and think they should be given full support, and that quickly. If we now fail to make a definite response to their present offer, it will certainly seem that we are leaving them in the lurch on two most important matters in whichthe action they have taken is the result of their adherence to principles whichwe fully share. It will look as though, while we are content to put forwardresolutions and talk about economic unity, they are taking concrete measures tomeet the situation. It would prove embarrassing to our representatives inGermany if they were not authorised to make an immediate and sympatheticresponse to the American proposals. More important still, it has been shown above that we can only hope to reorganise our own zone satisfactorily from thefinancial point of view if we charge dollars for all exports from our zone,including exports of coal to the American zone.   But this would not really be[32181] 3 2
practical politics. If we accept the American offer of co-operation, the questiondoes not arise in so far as they are concerned. Finally, if we accepted an american offer which contained the provisions for pooling of imports on the lines suggested in paragraph 4 above, this would to a very large extent solve our difficulties as regards the procurement of food for the British zone in Germany.8. The only contrary argument of importance is that we would appear, byjoining our two zones, to be ganging up against the Russians, and dividingEurope into two. But it will probably be quite salutary for the Russians to feel that we can if we wish do this, and that we mean business. Mr. Byrnesmade it quite clear in Paris that it is not the intention of the Americans tointerfere with existing quadripartite machinery more than is absolutely necessary,and that his offer is not meant as a first step towards a permanent division ofGermany into two. We should make it clear, if we went into a scheme of thiskind with the Americans, that this was also our idea, and that we hoped theRussian zone would sooner or later join with the British and American zonesin treating Germany as an economic whole. We are more likely to be able to persuade the Russians to do this if we have already strengthened the economicand financial system in the West. We would make this attitude clear to theRussians not only by verbal declarations but by offering immediately to discuss with them means of increasing the exchange of goods between the British and russian zones, and by expediting the exchange of liaison missions between thetwo zones, for which preparations are already being made.9. One important but subsidiary point is that if and when the Russiansagree to rejoin an organisation embracing the whole of Germany, we should haveto insist that the liquidation of accumulated deficits on the balance of payments of other zones was a first charge on the resources of Germany as a whole.10. I therefore recommend that we should immediately accept the Americanoffer in principle and arrange for immediate further study of the means of implementing it.11. At the same time as this offer is accepted, we should circulate to theGovernments of the other three occupying Powers a considered statement of theBritish attitude as regards the treatment of Germany as an economic whole and reparations, in order to make clear once and for all the basis on which webelieve that German economic questions should be treated. I attach a draft ofthis statement at Annex B.12. There would have been some advantage in waiting to hear from theother Governments whether they agreed with this statement before taking theaction proposed above, but in view of the reasons indicated in paragraph 7 it doesnot seem possible to delay our decision any further.13. If, contrary to present expectations, the Russians were to agree withour statement and were willing to set up machinery to carry out its principles,there would be nothing to prevent them joining immediately the system which we and the Americans would be in the early stages of working out. If, as is far more likely, they were to refuse to agree or to return a temporising answer, weshould be all the more justified in going on our way with the Americans.14. It cannot be foreseen exactly what the French attitude will be. TheAnglo-American system would certainly be open for them to join at once. Inview of their disappointment with the Russian attitude in Paris there is somepossibility that they may do so, but they will not like the idea of Germanadministrations, which is inherent in the American proposal. Nor will they likethe idea of retaining more coal in Germany.15. Another important aspect of the Paris discussions was the continuedrefusal of the Russians to agree to the setting up of a Disarmament Commissionin Germany which would examine whether war material was being produced inany zone of Germany. We have very clear reports that this is going on in theRussian zone, and it is desirable that we should make the best use of these reports in the hope of either getting the Russians to change their attitude or at leastreducing the amount of production of this kind which they are carrying on. Iwould normally have suggested that the best course would be for the british commander-in-Chief to lay the evidence before the Allied Control Council atan early date and to renew the suggestion for a comprehensive investigation inall zones. In view, however, of the delicate situation with regard to Anglo-Russian relations in Germany which will probably result from our acceptance
of the American offer-to form a single economic unit of the British and Americanzones, there are advantages in postponing this course. I would therefore suggestthat we should gradually allow some of the facts in our possession to be published and broadcast. At the appropriate moment a statement might be made inParliament in reply to a question and the process could then be brought to a headby a resolution before the Allied Control Council some time before the next meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers on Germany. We ought by thattime to have got over the initial shock of our announcement as regards theco-operation of the British and American zones. I would like the authority ofthe Government to carry out this programme subject, of course, to any unforeseendevelopments which may occur in the meanwhile. A summary of the evidence on this matter at present in our possession is attached at Annex C.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,23rd July, 1946.ANNEX A.Synopsis of Paris Discussions on Germany and Austria.Germany.I. Economic Unity.THE Secretary of State urged that the Potsdam provisions relating to thetreatment of Germany as an economic whole and the equitable distribution ofindigenous resources should be applied at once, both in order to show that theAllies were united and that the Four-Power system continued, and in order toreduce the burdens now falling on the British taxpayer. Mr. Byrnes gave general support. M. Molotov refused to accept the British proposals. He maintained that economic unity of Germany would be achieved by allowing German industryand foreign trade to be developed, subject to Four-Power control over industry,particularly in the Ruhr. The Secretary of State said that he could not agree toany such control being applied particularly to the Ruhr. There must bereciprocity. He enquired how the Soviet zone would be fitted into a control ofthis kind. M. Molotov maintained that indigenous resources from the Russianzone should only be transferred to the Western zones in return for deliveries of equipment as reparations from the Western zones to Russia which had hardlybegun. The Secretary of State formally declared that, if there was no agreement on treating Germany as an economic unit, the British zone would have to be organised in such a way as to make it no longer a financial liability to HisMajesty&apos;s Government. This might involve ploughing back coal and other pro-duction into the British zone. His Majesty&apos;s Government would, however, be willing for the British zone to co-operate on a fully reciprocal basis with anyother zone. He also referred to the reservation with regard to economic unitywhich had been made by the British representatives in Germany when the levelof industry plan was settled. M. Bidault said that the French Government pro-visionally agreed to the treatment of Germany as an economic unit even thoughthe unit now included certain territories which they thought should be detachedfrom Germany. Mr. Byrnes made an offer that the United States zone would join with any other zone willing to co-operate, and that the zones co-operating inthis manner should be treated as an economic unit. The Secretary of State saidthat His Majesty&apos;s Government would study this proposal urgently.2. Central Administrations.Mr. Byrnes suggested that some of the difficulties mentioned above couldbe avoided if there was agreement to set up central administrations at once, andto carry out paragraphs 9, 14, 15 and 19 of the Potsdam agreement, only amended to exclude the Saar from the operation of central administrations. M. Molotovsaid that the Russians regarded central administrations as a necessary pre-liminary to the establishment of a central government, but required time to study the Saar question. M. Bidault proposed that Allied Offices should be set up under the Allied Control Council with German executive personnel to carry outmeasures necessary for economic unity provided that the Saar were excludedfrom the operation of these Offices.
3. Settlement of Western Germany.The French re-stated their original position with regard to the Ruhr, Rhine-land and the Saar. M. Molotov said that he was opposed to the detachment ofthe Ruhr or any other area from Germany unless the inhabitants voted in favourof this in a plebiscite. The Secretary of State said that he was in favour ofa settlement of the Saar in the sense desired by the French at the same time as.other German questions were settled. He also hoped for an arrangement for the rhineland which would take account of French security interests but withoutannexation to France. Mr. Byrnes said that he was willing to exclude the Saarfrom the operation of German central administrations and to leave it to be administered by France. M. Molotov said he required time to study this question.4. Future Constitution of Germany.M. Molotov said that Germany must not be annihilated. This meant that german industry must not be destroyed and that no dismemberment or f ederalisa-tion should be imposed on Germany unless the Germans themselves wanted this.A central German Government should be set up in due course. The Secretary ofState said that His Majesty&apos;s Government had an open mind as regards the future constitution but were inclined to favour a loosely-knit State. M. Bidault spokestrongly in favour of giving large powers to provincial administrations. germany should be a confederation rather than a federal State.5. United States Draft Treaty.The Secretary of State and M. Bidault supported this. M. Molotov describedit as inadequate even for the specific purposes of disarmament and demilitarisationand as omitting other important aspects of the future settlement with Germany.He did not completely reject the draft but said it required considerable revision.He also said that before we could think of a treaty, it would be necessary to havea central German Government which could be trusted.6. Reparations.M. Molotov insisted on the Soviet claim of 10,000 million dollars worth of reparations from Germany. He referred to the mention of this amount in theYalta protocol and intimated that the Russians still regarded this figure as theamount of their total claim, the implication being that they will continue to takereparations from current production in Germany until reparation deliveries tothem have reached this amount. Mr. Byrnes and the Secretary of State stronglycontested - these arguments. The Secretary of State formally stated that HisMajesty&apos;s Government did not accept M. Molotov&apos;s interpretation of Potsdamon this and would in due course circulate a statement to the other Powers.7. Disarmament Commission.There was a great deal of argument about the proposal that the Allied control commission should send a commission to investigate disarmament and demilitari-sation throughout Germany. M. Molotov refused to agree that it should includeinvestigation into the production of war material and insisted that the Commis-sion should only investigate the disbanding of armed forces and draw.up a plan for the destruction of German industrial war potential. The Secretary of Stateand Mr. Byrnes refused to accept this proposal. M. Bidault said he was readyto accept any enquiry agreed by the other Powers.8. Special Deputies.Mr. Byrnes made repeated efforts to obtain agreement on the immediateappointment of Special Deputies to consider long-term German questions relatingto the eventual peace settlement with Germany. The Secretary of State gavegeneral support and M. Bidault agreed. M. Molotov maintained that it was undesirable to appoint Special Deputies before some agreements in principle hadbeen reached in the Council of Foreign Ministers so that the Deputies would have some basis on which to work. The Secretary of State suggested that instead ofSpecial Deputies, a preparatory Commission should be appointed to collate theviews and proposals of the four Governments and prepare for a later meeting ofthe Council by showing what questions had to be discussed. M. Molotov wouldnot agree to this either. It was agreed that there should be a special session ofthe Council of Foreign Ministers on Germany immediately after the end of theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations.
9. Coal.During the Conference, informal conversations took place between British,French and American experts on coal production in western Germany. certain minor questions relating to payment and conditions of delivery were settled andthere was useful discussion of means of increasing production&apos;such as incentives to greater output, increased supply of mining machinery, and methods of manage-ment. There was general agreement that further incentives were needed, par-ticularly in the form of special food rations, special supplies of consumer goods and improvements in housing. It was also agreed that mining supplies shouldhave the first call on allocation of steel, after military requirements and foodprocessing. There was a fundamental divergence of view between British and american experts on the one hand and the French on the other on two important questions. The British and Americans thought that a greater proportion of coalmust be retained in Germany in order to provide these incentives and increasemining supplies. The French thought that this could be done without increasingthe consumption of coal. The British and Americans thought that the mines should be managed by Germans, the French thought that Allied management wasbest. It was generally agreed that no further progress could be made without an investigation on the spot and that as many of the questions at issue depended on allocation which was a matter for four-Power decision in Germany the whole subject should be pursued on a four-Power basis.M. Bidault raised the question in the Council of Foreign Ministers and itwas agreed that the Council should instruct the Allied Control Council toappoint an expert committee to report on measures necessary for the increaseof production and on general principles of allocation of German coal betweeninternal consumption and export. The Committee&apos;s report is to be consideredby the Allied Control Council who are in turn to report to the Council of foreign ministers before the 1st September next.Austria.The Secretary of State and Mr. Byrnes tried to obtain agreement that the deputies should be instructed to consider drafts of a treaty with Austria.M. Molotov refused to agree to this unless the Council first discussed and accepted in principle a series of proposals which he submitted concerning thecompletion of denazification in Austria and the removal of displaced persons and refugees. He alleged that most of the latter were Fascists or had foughtfor the Germans and were a danger to Austria and neighbouring countries.After much discussion M. Molotov would only agree that the Allied ControlAuthority should be asked to report on the questions he had raised and theCouncil of Foreign Ministers should discuss this report and the question of atreaty at its next meeting.The Secretary of State proposed that the Council should set up a four-Power commission to advise about the definition of German assets in Austria.He circulated a proposed definition. M. Molotov evaded discussion of thisquestion and it was not possible to secure agreement to it.ANNEX B.Draft Statement by His Majesty&apos;s Government to be Circulated to theUnited States, Soviet and French Governments on the Treatment ofGermany as an Economic Whole and Reparations.During the discussions on Germany in the Council of Foreign Ministers inJuly 1946 the United Kingdom representative asked for the agreement of theCouncil to a resolution for putting into practice the principle set out in the potsdam Agreement of treating Germany as an economic whole. The relevant provisions of the Potsdam Agreement are the following :  &quot; Economic Principles.&quot; 11. In order to eliminate Germany&apos;s war potential, the production ofarms, ammunition and implements of war as well as all types of aircraft and sea-going ships shall be prohibited and prevented. Production of metals,chemicals, machinery and other items that are directly necessary to a wareconomy, shall be rigidly controlled and restricted to Germany&apos;s approvedpost-war peace-time needs to meet the objectives stated in paragraph 15.

The relevant provisions of the Potsdam Agreement are the following : &quot; Economic Prhiciples.&quot;11. In order to eliminate Germany&apos;s war potential, the production ofarms, ammunition and implements of war as well as all types oi aircraft and sea-going ships shall l)e prohibited and prevented. Production of metals,chemicals, machinery and other items that are directly necessary to a wareconomy, shall be rigidly controlled and restricted to Germany&apos;s approvedpost-war peace-time needs to meet the objectives stated in paragraph 15.
Productive capacity not needed for permitted production shall be removed in accordance with the reparations plan recommended by the Allied Corn-mission oh reparations and approved by the Governments concerned or, ifnot removed, shall be destroyed. .&quot;14. During the period of occupation Germany shall be treated asa single economic unit. To this end common policies shall be established in regard to  ....&quot; (d) Import and export programmes for Germany as a whole; . . . .&quot; (/) Reparation and removal of industrial war potential ....&quot; 15. Allied control shall be imposed upon tlhe German economy butonly to the extent necessary &quot; (a) to carry out programmes of industrial disarmament and de militaires-tarisation, of reparations and of approved exports and imports;&quot;(b) to assure the production and maintenance of goods and services required to meet the needs of the occupying forces and displaced persons in Germany and essential to maintain in Germany averageliving standards not exceeding the average of the standards ofliving of European countries. (European countries means all european countries excluding the United Kingdom and the Union,of Soviet Socialist Republics);&quot; (c) to ensure in tlhe manner determined by the Control Council the equitable distribution of essential commodities between theseveral zones so as to produce a balanced economy throughoutGermany and reduce the need for iiup*&quot;*8 ....&quot; 19. Payment of reparations should leave enough resources to enablethe German people to subsist without external assistance. In working outthe economic balance of Germany the necessary means must be provided topay for imports approved by the Control Council in Germany. The proceeds of exports from current production and stocks shall be available in thefirst place for payment for such imports.&quot; The above clause will apply to the equipment and products referredto in paragraph 4 (a) and 4 (b) of the Reparations Agreement.&apos;&apos; Reparations from Germany.&quot;1. Reparation claims of the U.S.S.R. shall be met by removals fromthe zone of Germany occupied by the U.S.S.R. and from appropriate Germanexternal assets .....&quot;4. In addition to the reparations to be taken by the U.S.S.R. fromits own zone of occupation, the U.S.S.R. shall receive additionally fromthe Western zones : &quot; (a) 15 per cent, of such usable and complete industrial capital equip-ment. in the first place from the metallurgical, chemical and machine manufacturing industries, as is unnecessary for theGerman peace economy and should be removed from the western zones of Germany, in exchange for an equivalent value of food,coal, potash, zinc, timber, clay products, petroleum products andsuch other commodities as may be agreed upon.&quot; (b) 10 per cent, of such industrial capital equipment as is unnecessaryfor the German peace economy and should be removed from theWestern zones, to be transferred to the Soviet Government on reparations account without payment or exchange of any kindin return. ,&quot; Removals of equipment as provided in (a) and (b) above shall be made simultaneously.&quot;6. Removals of industrial capital equipment shall begin as soon aspossible and shall be completed within two years from the determinationspecified in paragraph 5. The delivery of products covered by 4 (a) aboveshall begin as soon as possible and shall be made by the U.S.S!R. in agreedinstalments within five years of the date hereof . . . .&quot;2. The order of these provisions is significant and shows that the require-ment that Germany should be treated as a.single economic unit during the period
of occupation is fundamental and takes precedence over any question of reparations. The United Kingdom proposals for putting these principles intoeffect were : (a) that there should be equitable distribution of indigenous resourcesthroughout Germany;(5) that procedure should&apos;be established for ensuring that any surplus ofindigenous resources in one zone is made available to meet a deficit in the approved requirements of other zones;(c) that if, after this equitable distribution has taken place, there is stilla surplus in any zone, and if there is still a deficit in the balance ofpayments of Germany as a whole, the surplus may only be exportedin return for acceptable currency, the proceeds being used towards meeting the said deficit.3.   The Soviet representative stated -(a) that the Soviet Government maintained its claim to reparations fromGermany to the value of 10 billion dollars;(6) that these reparations would be obtained not only from deliveries ofcapital plant and equipment, but also from commodities out ofGermany&apos;s current production;(c) that indigenous resources could not be sent from the Russian zone ofGermany to the other zones because paragraph 4 of Section III ofthe Potsdam Agreement stipulates that certain products are to besent to the Western zones in exchange for industrial capital equipmentdelivered as reparation from the Western zones to Russia, and thatthese deliveries of equipment had hardly begun to take place.4. The United Kingdom representative stated that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment did not agree with the Soviet interpretation of the Potsdam Agreement inthese matters, and would later circulate a statement to the other three Govern-ments setting out their point of view. The following are the views of HisMajesty&apos;.s Government: 5. It is a fundamental principle of the Potsdam Agreement that duringthe occupation Germany shall lie treated as an economic whole. The Agreementstates that common policies shall be established in regard to import and exportprogrammes for Germany as a whole, and that one of the purposes for whichAllied controls shall be imposed upon the German economy is in order to ensurethe equitable distribution of essential commodities between the several zones soas to produce a balanced economy throughout Germany and reduce the need for imports. When the Potsdam Agreement was published in August 1945, thisprovision was universally regarded as one of the most important results of the conference.6. This provision is unqualified, unconditional and unambiguous. It is laid down that payment of reparations should leave sufficient resources to enablethe German people to subsist without external assistance, and that payment forapproved imports into Germany shall be a first charge against the proceeds of exports from current production and stocks.7. The foregoing paragraphs summarise the views of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment in regard to the treatment of Germany as an economic whole. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment desire to place on record and confirm these views after the fullest andmost careful consideration of the statement made by the Soviet representative,which is referred to in paragraph 2 above.8. His Majesty&apos;s Government have never accepted the Soviet claim to10 billion dollars&apos; worth of reparations from Germany. They refused at theYalta Conference to consider this claim as a basis for discussion, and in anv. casethe Reparations Agreement reached at Potsdam supersedes all previous Agree-ments and discussions about reparations. This Agreement cannot be unilaterallyrepudiated by one of its signatories.9. &apos; Moreover, in the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government, the point at issue is not whether the Soviet Government has a claim to reparation from Germany tothe value of any specific amount. Unless and until Germany as a whole has an export surplus, the Soviet Government, in the explicit and unambiguous terms ofthe Potsdam Agreement, to which it was a party, is not entitled to take bv wavof reparation goods currently produced or stocks.[32181] &apos;   &apos; c
10. The Soviet representative also referred to the stipulation that certainproducts arc to be sent to the Western zones in exchange ior industrial capital equipment delivered from the Western zones to Russia, and said that thesedeliveries of equipment had hardly begun to take place. In the view of HisMajestys Government this stipulation is in no way relevant to the point at issue.It is no justification for commodities being removed from the Soviet zone by wayof reparations at a time when exports from Germany as -a whole are insufficient to pay for essential imports by more than  100 million a year a. burden which isfor the time being borne by the other occupying Powers.11. Thus His Majesty&apos;s Government adhere to their view as expressedabove. His Majesty&apos;s Government will be glad to learn at the earliest possible moment from the Governments of the other three occupying Powers whether they agree with the above statement of the principles which must govern the treatmentof Germany as an economic whole, and the taking of reparations from germany in the form of goods currently produced and stocks, and if so, whether they are ready to set up immediately the necessary machinery in Germany to put these principles into practice.ANNEX C.J.I.C.

We have prepared at Annex a summary of the evidence available to us of breaches of the Potsdam Agreement in the Russian zone of Germany.2. All the evidence in this report is considered reasonably well-established.The authorities concerned see no security objection to its being used openly, should this be considered desirable, either at the Paris Conference or in publicity. Sincethe requirements as regards reliability and security are the same, we considerthat our list is equally suitable for cither purpose.3. We have classified the available evidence according to whether it relates to breaches of the Potsdam Agreement in regard to demilitarisation, disarma-meut or disbandment of the German Armed Forces. There is ample evidence ofcontraventions by the Soviet authorities under these rthree headings.(Signed)   &apos;     H.. A. CACCIA.E. (G. N. RU3ILBROOKE.C.. )E. R. HIRSCH(For D.M.I.).R.. E.

ANNEX TO ANNEX C.Evidence of Russia&apos;s Contravention of Potsdam Agreement.Introduction.The relevant extracts of the Potsdam Agreement are as follows: &quot; 3. The purposes of the occupation of Germany by which the control council shall be guided are: (i) The complete disarmament and demilitarisation of Germany and the elimination or control of all German industry that could be usedfor military production.  To these ends : (a) All German land, naval and air forces, the S.S., S.A., S.D.and Gestapo, with all their organisations, staffs and institutions, including the General Staff, the Officers&apos;Corps, Reserve Corps, military schools, war veterans&apos;organisations and an other military and quasi-militaryorganisations, together with all clubs and associationswhich serve to keep alive the military tradition inGermany, shall be completely and finally abolished insuch manner as permanently to prevent the revival orreorganisation of German militarism and Nazism;(6) All arms, ammunition and implements of war, and allspecialised facilities for their production, shall be held atthe disposal of the Allies or destroyed. The maintenance and production of all aircraft and all arms, ammunition and implements of war shall be prevented.&quot;&quot; 11. In order to eliminate Germany&apos;s war potential, the productionof arms, ammunition and implements of war, as well as all types of aircraft and sea-going ships, shall be prohibited and prevented. Production of metals,chemicals, machinery and other items that are directly necessary to a wareconomy shall be rigidly controlled and restricted to Germany&quot;s approvedpost-war peace-time needs to meet the objectives stated in paragraph 15.Productive capacity not needed for permitted production shall be removed in accordance with the reparations plan recommended by the Allied Commis-sion on reparations and approved by the Governments concerned, or if notremoved shall be destroyed.&quot; .,Demilitarisation.A.

Wolf at Magdeburg Buckau.(ii) Carl Zeiss at Jena,  (fcee also paragraphs 7 and 12 below.)(iii) Bruckner Kanis at Dresden.(iv) Askania Werke at Berlin.   (See also paragraphs 9 and 10 below.)3. In addition to these activities, the three latter factories, together withGema at Koepenick and the firm of Kreisel, are also engaged on the design and building of depth-keeping gear for torpedoes, turbine units for U-boat andtorpedo propulsion, and fire control units for the Soviet Navy.4.  -Some of the raw material used for this production is supplied by Russia.B. Military.Research connected with V weapons.5. We have reliable evidence that the Russians are carrying out, in theirzone of Germany, both research and trials connected with V weapons. Amongstthe research establishments engaged on this work are the Institute Rabe withHeadquarters at Bleicherode, which is known to lie in operation and to berecruiting workers, and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin. In addition,reports show that it has been arranged for test firings to take place this summerat Peenemunde of V weapons (under a German expert Grottrup) and of specialartillery shells (under a German, Doctor Tromsdorf).
