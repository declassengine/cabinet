THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   June 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 252.-28th June, 1946.CABINET.UNITED MARITIME CONSULTATIVE COUNCIL.Memorandum by the Minister of Transport.^ IN my memorandum CP. (46) 230, I informed my colleagues of the line which the United Kingdom Delegation were instructed to take when the united maritime Consultative Council met for its first session at Amsterdam on the18th June.2. The discussions in the Council were favourable to our views both onthe general issues of shipping policy and upon the question of a future worldshipping organisation.3.   I attach copies of two important Resolutions adopted by the Council.4. The Committee, which, under the first Resolution, is to prepare a draft constitution of an inter-governmental body to deal with shipping, for considera-tion by the Governments represented on the United Maritime consultative council, will meet in London in the middle of July and the results of its work are to be circulated to the Council before the 15th September. The Secretary-General of the United Nations communicated to the Council the text of aResolution adopted by the Economic and Social Council on this question, whichauthorised the Secretary-General of the United Nations to seek the views ofthe United Maritime Consultative Council. In reply, the Chairman of theTatter Council was authorised to inform the Secretary-General of the united nations of the Resolution adopted at Amsterdam.5. The Conference was particularly satisfactory in that it showed a wide measure of international support for the shipping policies which we advocate.Of the important maritime powers, only the United States is at present unableto subscribe wholly to our policy. The United Kingdom Delegation, whilestating United Kingdom views, continued to avoid open conflict with the UnitedStates on long-term shipping issues, but succeeded in securing the adoptionof the second of the Resolutions attached which is unfavourable to certainshipping practices to which the United States is at present prone.6. By stating our principles in these meetings, and by mobilising in their support the majority of the maritime nations, we are paving the way for more positive action in the form of a code of rules to be internationally agreed. It isclear that this will be an important question for any inter-governmental shippingbody and the strong support of the United States for the establishment of suchan organisation is. therefore, encouraging.A. B.Ministry of Transport,28th June, 1946.[&quot;32036]
Resolution adopted by the United Maritime Consultative Council atAmsterdam, June 1946, regarding an Inter-Governmental Body to Dealwith Shipping Matters.The Council took note of the view generally expressed that an inter-governmental body is likely to be required to provide for consultation on all matters suitable for inter-governmental discussion as regards shipping andresolved to appoint a Committee -(1) to consider in more detail the possible constitution, scope and procedures of such a body, and(2) to draw up a draft report on these subjects for further considerationby the Council.The Council further agrees--(a) That the Committee should be composed of a single representative from each of the following nations : Belgium, Canada, France, Netherlands,Norway, Poland, United Kingdom and United States.(&amp;) That the Committee shall elect its own officers, and determine its ownprocedure.(c) That the Committee shall report to the members of the Council as soonas possible and not later than the 15th September, 1946, after which date the Council shall meet for the purpose of considering the report and of making recommendations to the member Governments priorto the 31st October, 1946.(2)Resolution adopted by the United Maritime Consultative Council atAmsterdam, June 1946, on Restoration of Normal Processes ofInternational Shipping Business.Resolved that this Council, having heard reports of the progress made by governments in returning to normal processes of international shipping, is satisfied that good progress is being made. In order to further this process theCouncil considers that (1) in exercising control over cargo or shipping Governments should refrain from action to retard the efforts of maritime nations to re-establishtheir shipping connections;(2) the allocation of Government-controlled cargo of a non-military characterin a regular liner trade should not be used as a means of influencing the distribution of traffic amongst the participating flags in that trade,as it may come about from time to time from normal competition, solong as they are capable of offering the services required uponacceptable terms;(3) Governments chartering ships for full cargoes should use the normalmachinery of the freight markets so that ships available under allflags may have an opportunity of providing the services required.
