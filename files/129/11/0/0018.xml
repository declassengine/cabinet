THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1946.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited, it is issued for the personal use of............... .........TOP SECRET Copy Wo.CP. (46) 268.10th July, 1946.CABINET.LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME, 1946-47 SESSION.Joint Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council and the lord privy Seal.AT their meeting on the 11th April (CM. (46) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 2)the Cabinet agreed in principle that the major Bills listed in paragraph 3 of cp. (46) 143 should form the main element in the Legislative Programme forthe earlier part of the 1946-47 Session, and invited the Legislation Committeeto superintend the preparation of these Bills.2. In addition to reviewing the progress made with the preparation of thesemajor Bills, the Legislation Committee have made a preliminary examinationof the total Legislative Programme for the 1946-47 Session. For this purpose they obtained particulars of all the Bills proposed for inclusion in the 1946-47Programme and, after consultation with the Ministers concerned, have drawnup the provisional Programme set out in the Annex. Jf the Cabinet approvethis Programme, it will serve as a guide to Departments for their work on thepreparation of legislation during the next two or three months, though it shouldbe clearly understood that the inclusion of any particular Bill in the provisional programme does not guarantee it a place in the final Programme, which willhave to be settled by the Cabinet concurrently with the preparation of The King&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament.3. In reviewing the Bills proposed for the 1946-47 Session the Committeehave had in mind the following considerations: *(i) The 1946-47 Session will be very much shorter than the 1945-46 Session,since it will not start until mid-November 1946, and it is, in our view,very desirable to bring it to an end in early August 1947.(ii) In each Session a considerable number of measures have to be passedwhich cannot be foreseen at the beginning of the Session. Thus, inthe 1945-46 Session, over 20 Bills not included in the list approved in September 1945 have subsequently had to be added to theProgramme.(iii) In the 1946-47 Session there is bound to be a need for amending legisla-tion to remedy defects in the major measures which have recently been passed.(iv) Some of the major Bills whose inclusion in the 1946-47 Programmeseems essential (e.g\., the Inland Transport Bill, the Town and country planning (Development Rights) Bill) are likely to be longer and morecontroversial than any major Bills in the 1945-46 Programme.&apos; (v) The amount of legislation in the current Session has inevitably driventhe House, of Commons pretty hard, and in the 1946-47 Session it willbe undesirable, except perhaps in the last weeks, to call on standing committees to sit more often than twice a week.[32120]
4. In view of the considerations set out in paragraph 3, the Committee havedrastically cut down the proposals for legislation submitted to them, and over30 of the 85 Bills put forward by Departments have been rejected. Nevertheless,the provisional Programme annexed to this Memorandum still contains a larger number of Bills than the Government are likely to find time for in the 1946-47Session even on the most optimistic assumptions, and there is little doubt thatwhen the Cabinet come to settle a final Programme in October a number of Billsnow in the list will have to be excluded.5. Group I of the Annex includes only those Bills the passage of which inthe 1946-47 Session must clearly be regarded as essential.Group II contains the major Bills whose inclusion in the Programme hasalready been approved in principle by the Cabinet. These Bills alone will occupya very large part indeed of the time available for legislation and the committee feel that at a later stage it may be necessary to lighten the Programme by the omission of one or more of them. Some relief would be found if it were possibleto achieve the necessary reorganisation of Empire Telecommunications Serviceswithout legislation; but the omission of the Companies Acts Amendment Bill, theRiver Boards Bill, the Criminal Justice Bill and the Poor Law (Abolition) Billmay also have to be considered. The President of the Board of Trade and theHome Secretary have pressed strongly for the retention in the Programme of theCompanies Acts Amendment Bill and the Criminal Justice Bill, which should,both be ready for introduction at the beginning of the 1946-47 Session, and theCommittee have agreed that for the present work on the drafting of these bills should continue.The Committee have placed in Group III those medium-sized Bills which on policy grounds should, in any event, proceed during the 1946-47 Session, and inGroup IV medium-sized Bills which might proceed if time permits.In Group Vthe Committee have included a number of minor non-controversialBills which it should be possible to fit in to the Programme without serious difficulty.6. In addition to the Bills mentioned in the annexed list, the Committeewere urged to include in the Programme a Motorways Bill, a Sea Fish industry bill, a Housing Bill and a Housing (Scotland) Bill. They felt, however, that before a decision was reached on whether these Bills should be included, the policy to be embodied in them ought to be considered by the appropriate CabinetCommittee.7.   We invite the Cabinet-^(i) to approve the annexed list of Bills as a provisional Programme for the1946-47 Session for the guidance of Departments in the preparationof legislation pending the formulation of a final Programme con-currently with the preparation of The King&apos;s Speech;(ii) to authorise the Legislation Committee to keep the provisional Pro-gramme under review and to make such minor adjustments in it asmay seem desirable from time to time.8. We would again stress the confidential nature of the proposals in thismemorandum and would invite the attention of all Ministers to the need for avoiding any anticipation of The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliamentiby promising that particular Bills will be introduced during the forthcoming session.H.
