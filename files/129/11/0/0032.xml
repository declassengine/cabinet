THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1946.SECRET Copy No.CP. (46) 282.18th July, 1946.CABINET.THE RHODESIA RAILWAYS.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and the Secretary of State for the Colonies.WE feel that it is desirable to consult our colleagues with regard to aquestion which has been under consideration as to the acquisition by theGovernments of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and the bechuanaland protectorate of the equity of the Rhodesia Railways Limited.2. The Rhodesia Railways Limited own the railway system through the bechuanaland Protectorate and Southern and Northern Rhodesia, as well asa small section of line which is in the Union of South Africa. The nominalshare capital of the company is  500,000 and there is also a 4^ per cent,debenture stock of about  20 million which the Company has the right to repayon the 1st October, 1947. The share capital of the Company is wholly owned ,(by the Rhodesia Railways Trust Limited, an Investment Company of whoseshare capital 82 per cent, is held by the British South Africa Company. Thethree Governments already have a considerable degree of financial control overthe Railway Company, including limitation of dividend, the purposes to whichrevenue may be applied and changes in rates.3. In 1943 a proposal was received from the Southern Rhodesia Governmentthat the principle should be accepted of the desirability of the Governments ofSouthern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and the Bechuanaland Protectorateobtaining control of the railway system, in their territories, and that with thisobject steps should be taken with a view to the purchase of the share capital ofthe Rhodesia Railways Limited if satisfactory terms could be arranged. our predecessors felt that this proposal raised important financial and economicissues, affecting Northern Rhodesia and the Bechuanaland Protectorate, which required special examination, and arrangements were made to appoint a commissioner to advise on these issues.4. After some delay, owing to war-time conditions, Sir Harold Howitt wasappointed in May 1945 to advise His Majesty&apos;s Government on the question. his report was completed last December and was subsequently published as aStationery Office Paper. The effect was to suggest that the question of the advisability of the Government acquisition of the equity of the Rhodesia railways should be deferred for at least five years and that in the meantime the Govern-ments should consider various difficult issues involved, to which he called attention in his report. In arriving at the view that the time is not yet ripe to propose the immediate acquisition of the equity (which he suggests might involve a payment of  2^- to  4 million), he was influenced largely by the consideration that such acquisition would inevitably involve the Governments in the guarantee of the large debenture issue, and that, having regard to the financial position ofthe territories and the uncertainties of the post-war period, this would be aserious matter. Indeed, so far as Northern Rhodesia and the Bechuanaland!Protectorate are concerned, their Governments would not be able to guaranteetheir share of the debenture interest without the backing of the United KingdomGovernment. Sir Harold Howitt felt, therefore, that the only workable scheme would be for His Majesty&apos;s Government to give a guarantee to the whole issueof debentures. This, however, would require legislation in this country, andit was pointed out in the report that a United Kingdom Government guarantee[32156]
for the whole issue would involve conditions which might not be found to accord with the position of Southern Rhodesia as a self-governing Colony.5. It should also be pointed out that, in addition to the renewal of some 20 million Debentures next year, a sum of from  6 to 9 millions is needed for re-equipment.6. Apart from this aspect, there are considerations of a political character,viz : (1) the difficulty of setting up a State Organisation which would success-fully control a Government Railway serving three territories with very differentpolitical status, and (2) the policy to be adopted wuth regard to African labour on the railway. The position in this respect is that, although there is no legalcolour bar applicable to the railway in any of the three territories, an effectivecolour bar is imposed by the European Railway Workers&apos; Union. In view ofthe attitude on this question in Southern Rhodesia generally, it would be verydifficult to secure a modification of this position if the railway came under the ownership of the three Governments, and its maintenance in such circumstances would implicate directly the Governments of Northern Rhodesia and the bechuanaland Protectorate and indirectly the United Kingdom Government.7. We have recently had the advantage of discussing the matter with theGovernor of Northern Rhodesia, who is at present in this country, and, in viewof the difficulties mentioned above, and particularly those referred to in thepreceding paragraph, as well as the fact that, as already mentioned, the three governments already exercise a considerable measure of control over the railway,we have come to the conclusion that an immediate decision in favour of theacquisition by the Governments of the equity of the railways cannot be regardedas practicable at present. Whereas, however, Sir Harold Howitt suggests thatthe matter should deferred for at least five years, we feel that it would be better that the matter should be regarded as definitely postponed for a period of tenyears in order that the present uncertainty should be removed and a start madewith the necessary renewals and improvements.8. On this basis we have prepared the annexed statement, which, if theCabinet agree, would be forwarded confidentially to the Southern rhodesia government with an enquiry whether they would agree to a communication beingmade to the British South Africa Company in the sense indicated in the state-ment. An offer would, however, be made to the Southern Rhodesia Governmentto discuss the matter with them here if they would wish to send over a Ministerto this country for the purpose, though in view of the urgency this would haveto be done quickly.G. H. H.18th July, 1946.ANNEX.Statement.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government have given careful consideration to the report presented by Sir Harold Howitt on the question of the state ownership of the rhodesia railways, and have had the advantage of discussing the matter withthe Governor of Northern Rhodesia during his present visit to this country.2. Sir Harold Howitt indicated in his report that the matter was acomplicated one on which the decision was not easy. While expressing the viewthat Government ownership is bound to come and that there were various considerations in favour of this course, he pointed out that there were manyfactors which weighed against an immediate decision to acquire the equity ofthe railway. Sir Harold Howitt pointed out in particular the uncertainty ofthe future earning capacity of the railway system from the point of view ofthe possibility of a decrease, and also of a diversion, of the copper traffic. Thispoint is one which particularly concerns the Government of Northern Rhodesiawhose financial interests are already largely bound up with the copper market.To increase the dependence on copper by adding a railway risk would, in theview of the Northern Rhodesia Government, be a dangerous financial stepparticularly at a time when they propose to embark on a very necessary and large development programme.
3. It is felt also that considerable weight should be attached to the possible effect of state ownership on the question of the outlet to Beira. If the Beirarailway and port were acquired by the Portuguese it might be possible for themto impose considerably higher rates and the Governments would have no effectivecounter, as the haulage through British territory to South Africa is too long-to be seriously contemplated as an alternative to Beira. The question arisestherefore whether it would not be desirable to clarify the position by an agreementwith the Portuguese before a decision in favour of state ownership of the Rhodesiarailways is taken.4. The financial considerations involved are also serious. Northern Rhodesiamight afford to pay for its share of the equity of the undertaking : bechuanaland protectorate certainly could not. As regards loan capital, the continued existenceof debentures charged on the undertaking might not be regarded as compatible with public ownership. If so, neither Northern Rhodesia, nor bechuanaland protectorate has the financial resources with which to assume responsibility forany share of the existing loan capital, or of the substantial amount of freshcapital that must be raised in order to carry on the undertaking. Sir HaroldHowitt suggests indeed in his report that His Majesty&apos;s Government mightguarantee the existing and the new loan capital. But such a guarantee couldnot be given without the authority of an Act of Parliament. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are not satisfied that there are grounds on which they would bejustified in asking Parliament to impose this liability on the U.K. taxpayer.Finally, as pointed out in paragraph 117 of Sir Harold Howitt&apos;s report, ifpowers of guarantee were conferred on the U.K. Government, they could only beexercised on conditions that enabled that Government to supervise the loan soas to protect the U.K. taxpayer against the risk of default and to recover anymonies paid in the event of default -conditions that might well be inconsistent with the self-governing status of Southern Rhodesia.5. There are many other matters which would clearly require long and careful study before a decision to acquire the equity of the railways could betaken. There is for instance the difficulty in arranging for a suitable systemof joint control by three administrations of different constitutional status andthere is also the important and difficult question of arriving at an agreed policy with regard to the employment on the railway of African labour.6. All these considerations point to the fact that an immediate decision infavour of the acquisition by the Governments of the equity of the railways cannotbe regarded as practicable. Sir Harold Howitt recommended in his report thatthe question of the advisability of Government acquisition should be deferred for at least five years. An early decision whether there should be a definite period of postponement is desirable since the British South Africa Company,as explained in the attached memorandum* which has recently been receivedfrom them, will be involved in early discussions with the Portuguese Governmentand also must start arrangements not later than October of this year for raising the necessary loan of about  26 million required to pay off the outstandingdebentures and to provide fresh capital for the business. It will be rememberedthat in the Company&apos;s previous memorandum they suggested that if the Govern-ments contemplated acquiring the equity in about five years time they mightwdsh the new loan to be raised on terms which included an option to repay atthe end of 1950. His Majesty&apos;s Government are advised that the inclusionof such an option in the prospectus would introduce an element of uncertaintywhich might make the raising of the necessary money more difficult. There isalso the consideration that to leave the British South Africa Company for ashort time in the position of caretakers would make it difficult for them totake the necessary action to carry out the programme of reconstruction on therailways which is so urgently required, so that it would, in the interests of thethree Territories as well as of the Company, be desirable either that negotia-tions with a view to the acquisition of the equity should be undertaken at onceor that there should be a definite decision against the acquisition for a substantialperiod of years. The conclusion which has been reached by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment is that in the circumstances the British South Africa company should be advised that they should raise the necessary loan on a ten years basiswithout including any provision giving an option to repay at an earlier date,and that the question of the State acquisition of the equity of the railways should be regarded as definitely postponed until the end of that period.   Having* Not printed.
regard to the considerable degree of financial control over the Railway Companyalready provided for in the existing legislation, including limitation of dividend,His Ma]esty&apos;s Government feel that the delay should not entail substantialdisadvantages. The local Governments will, however, no doubt consider whethersteps should be taken to create an advisory Transport Authority of the charactersuggested in Sir H. Howitt&apos;s report. It has been suggested as a result of a discussion between the Governor of Northern Rhodesia and the Prime Ministerof Southern Rhodesia that a Transport Adviser to the-three Governments shouldbe appointed as Chairman of such an Authority. His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould be very glad to help in securing a suitable person for this appointmentif the three Governments so desire.
