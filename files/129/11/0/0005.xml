S E C Pc E TCVP-(U6) 255 COPY NO.2ND JULY,  19U6CABINETPOLITICAL broadcasting memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilSince I circulated my memorandum (CP. (U6) 253) ofthe 1st July,  the Director-General of the B.B.C.  has informed thePostmaster-General that Mr. Churchill has claimed the right to reply on a Sunday evening, on behalf of the Opposition, to mybroadcast of Sunday, 30th June.      The Director-General points outthat the aidememoire on political broadcasting (annexed toCcP,(k6) h8) does not strictly cover such an application, buthe feels that the process of consultation between the partiesenvisaged therein may be the best way of dealing with the matter,in the event,  however,  of no agreement being reached,  or of theGovernment not wishing the.consultations to take place, then theCorporation will itself decide the matter.      As the question is extremely urgent,  and there is a meeting of the Governors onThursday, hth July, he asks for a reply by the morning of thatdayn      I circulate a copy of his letter as Annex I.2t I also annex a copy of my broadcast  (Annex II).     Mycolleagues must be the judges, but I suggest that a Ministerialbroadcast on the economic situation,  in relation to the ProsperityCampaign conducted in the general interest,  could hardly have been less controversial either In matter or manner.      On the other hand,I recognise that-it is possible to argue that in the broad senseit is controversial - that, for example, it describes the positionas the Government see it and not as seen by the Government1scritics, and that an Opposition spokesman, even if trying to beimpartial, would have treated the subject differently.      It beganwith an account of the improvement in our economic affairs forwhich the credit could go to&apos; the Government,  although I was careful to pay tribute to management and workers.3. It is tempting to acquiesce-in a reply by Mr. churchill and&apos;insist on a Ministerial reply to him, in the assurance, as towhich I have no doubt, that the Government would get the betterof the argument. But the matter is not so simple as that. Wehave tried to lift the Prosperity Campaign above party politics,and, like the Prime Minister in his broadcast in February, I wassoeaking on Sunday not in a personal capacity or as a Party man,but as a Minister of the Crown in an appeal to the nation for co-(THIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)

operation in the task of reconversion.      Can we countenancean attempt by the Opposition to introduce party where in thenational interest we have been so careful to exclude it?     can we allow the Opposition if they so wish to interfere with theproduction drive?4, We must also face the consequences for the future.If we accept Mr.   Churchill&apos;s contention that this broadcast of mine was controversial,  there can, I suggest, be few Ministerialbroadcasts to which the Opposition could not make out an equallyplausible case for the right of reply.      But that would lead toan intolerable situation.      Could any Government accept from any opposition a claim to reply as of right, say, to an appeal forrecruits for the fighting services or essential industry, or toa statement of the need for fuel economy?     Yet in certaincircumstances it might well be argued that these werecontroversial.5. Serious results would certainly follow theacceptance of anything approaching an automatic Opposition rightof reply to Ministerial broadcasts, which could with any measureof plausibility be said to be controversial.In the first place,  the Government in their conducti of the nation&apos;s business would, to a large extent, be deprived: of the effective use for legitimate purposes of one of the&apos;most; important    of modern publicity media.      In the second, Parliament1 could not fail to suffer from the competition of this alternativeforum for debates by leading Parliamentarians on major issues of the day.      And, thirdly,  I suggest that it would not be long before the patience of the public was exhausted,  to the detrimentalike of the B.B.C. , the political parties and the national interest.6. The issues raised by both Mr.  Churchill&apos;a recentmoves are so difficult and controversial that it is too much toI expect the Governors of the B.B.C.  to be able to settle them; satisfactorily on their own,  and I suggest that, in accordancewith the spirit,  if not the letter,  of the aide-memoire,  and as contemplated by the Director-General of the B.B.C., we should immediately take the matter up with the Opposition.7, Our line might he that we do not consider that mybroadcast comes within the category of controversial broadcastingas the expression has been understood in the past.      It was partof the Governments Prosperity Campaign which was initiated bythe Prime Ministers broadcast in February (to which,  incidentally,the Opposition did not claim the right to reply),  and theGovernment have taken care throughout to keep the Campaign on anational non-party plane.      In our view,  therefore, the question   -of an Opposition reply - to which there w-oul-d^ of course,  in turn   [have to be a Ministerial answer - does not arise.      However, we welcome,  in principle,  the idea of the resumption of politicalbroadcasting,  and we recognise that both Mr.  Churchill&apos;s request to the B.B.C.  and his letter to the Prime Minister raise important and difficult questions not fully covered in the previousdiscussions with the Opposition.      We should be happy to enter into further discussions with the Opposition and the B.B.C. with aview to an understanding being reached which would govern thesematters for the future.H.M.Office of the Lord President of the Council,S.W.   1.2nd July,  1946.

ANNEX IITHE LORD PRESIDENT&apos;S BROADCAST.9*15-9*50 P.m. Sunday, Jane 50BRITAIN GET3 GOING again on some Sunday nights lately you. have heard talks on the challenge of Our Time.      These talks have gone very deep anaranged for into the future, but- the challenge of cur time alsocomes right into our daily life and work.All of us - whether we are coalmlnors, or shop-keepers,or factory workers,  or managers,  or farmers, or foundrymen,  or ministers of the Crown - have constantly at the hack of our minds some very simple question;.; which are for us the test of whether things are going right or wrong.      Such questions, forinstance,  as what can I look forward to ia the future?      Isit good enough?      Is it the best that I can reasonably expect,or could it be mode better?     What is my part in all this?Is it going to happen whatever I do, or will it only happen if I do certain things?     When can I spend as much as I likewith a clear conscience?     How long am I going on having toqueue.for all sorts of everyday things?When masses of figures are put before me about output and manpower and overseas trade, it is ray job as a Minister to*size up what those figures signify in terms of these very simple,very basic,  human questions.      In the last resort, all politicaland economic and social problems are simply problems aboutpeople,  everyday folk.We talk about the food problem.     And there is a foodproblem.      But it is really a problem of how we are going tcbehave about food - as food growers, as food distributors, andas food consumers.It is just the some with coal,  or full employment,  oranything else.We hove all probably felt at one tine or another thatthere is too much of&apos; a gulf between the problems as wo readabout thorn in the papers in broad and general terms and theproblems as they hit us in our doily lives, particularly asproducers and consumers.      All parties in Parliament gaveexpression to this feeling in the Debate on Economic Affairs onFebruary 27/28.      There was a national demand for the Governmentto give a lead and toll people what each could most usefully do tosee&quot;&quot;Britain through the post-war reconversion and reconstructionphase.      As the Prime Minister said when he broadcast to you onMarch 3rd to launch the Prosperity Campaign,  &quot;We want morehouses,  clothes, household goods, coal, machinery - in fact every kind of thing.      There is only one way to get these things.That is by work&quot;.

, Since that evening conferences have been bold up and down the country between members of the Government and thousandsox representatives of employers and workers.      We think these meetings have been valuable in helping industry to understand what the Government is trying to do and in helping theGovernment to understand better the difficulties and anxietiesof  ooGh sides of industry.      In these man-to-man&apos; talks toand by Ministers everyone has said what he likes, and a lot of useful ideas have come up.      Those who hove attended these conferences in Cardiff, Glasgow, Birmingham, Manchester, Leedsand other towns have gone back better equipped to work out withtheir associates how to pull together for prosperity.On the whole, the nation is entitled to be pleased andencouraged with the results of its first efforts to got goingagain after the war.      Of course there are dongerous: ;ond.tiresome bottlenecks and difficulties over food,  cool, clothing,housing and much else,  but wo in this country haven&apos;t lot thorndeter us or weaken our spirit.The first stage of reconversion was the release of menand women from war jobs.      Since June last year we have cutdown the number of people working for the Forces and their supplies by about 6 millions (that is by about -g- million everymonth).      The target was to reduce the Forces from 3,850,000 atthe end of last year to 1,200,000 by the end of this.      Alreadywe are more than half way there,  and I have little doubt that weshall meet the target.      Supplies for the Forces were employing1,790,000 at the end of last-year, but this figure is beingcut to 500,000 by the end of this:      two thirds of this cuthad already been carried out by the end of April.The next stage was to get men and women who have been released in this way into productive work.      Some of course  *have retired from industry and. so-.no are still taking demobleave,  but there are four million more people in peacetimecivilian jobs than there were a year ago.      In fact, talcing thewhole insured population, 97 out of every 100 now ready for work  -arc employed, leaving only 3 out of every 100 unemployed andthose mostly for very short periods.     While unemployment isan evil in itself,  employment is not good in itself;    it issimply a means to an end - more earnings and goods and services for all.Are the goods and services coming forward in bettermeasure?      They are.      Last autumn,  for instance,  there were less than 10,000 permanent post-war houses built or building in all Great Britain.      When the Prime Minister broadcast inMarch there were 52,000.      At the end of May there were 11h,000.If you think of these figures as a graph, you will see that therises are sharp.      Starting with only /22,000 workers in^thebuilding industry a year ago, we got up to 1,08k,000 by theend of April and our end-year target is 1,1+00,000,      that means the building industry is being doubled in size over idmonths.      At the Now Year as you know the bottleneck in bricksthreatened to hold, up housing;    since then,  thanks to thegreat production effort by. the industry,  output has boohpractically doubled.

Or take motor cars.      Last September the output wasonly just over 1,000.      By February it got up to 10,700,Last month it was over 18,000.      Lost month, we actually :-.v. do more motor cycles for sale in this country than in 1935*In addition to that, the production for export was at double the pre-war rote.     Radio sots have increased from 11,000monthly last summer to 8h,000 in April this year.      Stealproduction is well above pre-war levels.      Perhaps the mostimpressive sign of how Britain has got going again is thefact that wo are using just twice as much electricity as wewore ten years ago, mainly in industry.      By the end of thisyear 5,375,000 men and women arc expected to be working onmanufactures for the home market, compared with 3*685*000 atthe end of 19h7.      In other words,  that is an increase ofabout h-Ojb, and all of then&quot;! working not for export, &quot;but for what we need here at home.Remarkable strides have been made in our capacity tosupply our own needs at homo,  but of course wo olso&apos;nood.&quot; agreat deal of food and materials and other things   fromabroad which we con only get by paying for them - that is byexports.     How are our exports looking?     They are reviving&apos; -wonderfully,  and all who work on exports are entitled to beproud of themselves.      In December of lost year our exports were worth  1+6 millions, end we in the Government felt&quot; that anaverage of  62^ millions a month for 1 9h6 would bo a fairtarget.     But employers and managers and workers are gettingtogether, and beating this target handsomely.      By April they reached  69-^ millions and &quot;by May they were up to  85&quot;millions.&quot;Letts say those figures again.    1+6, 69^, 85 - if this increasegoes on industry is going to beat the target by Hundreds ofmillions of pounds&apos; worth of goods.   Right away this is givingthe world greater confidence in Britain.      In good time itwill bring us more imports of the things which will make life *-more enjoyable;    fruit to oat,  petrol to travel with,newsprint and paper, leather and other things which we havebeen doing without or going short of.      Lot&apos;s hope it won11be long before there is some pleasure and. fun in going shopping.To-day it&apos;s a full-time job,  and I cannot find words toexpress my admiration for the women who are keeping our homes and families together under the trying difficulties of to-day.If it were only to give them a reward this effort is worth while.There is of course a darker side.      Goal, for example.Our stocks of coal are lower now than they have been inpeace or war for 3 food many years.      If cool steps,everything stops.     Pull employment and shortage of coalcannot go together.      No one has a right to bo prouder ofhimselfi than the man who is working full-time at tho coalface.      He is&apos;in the very front of the battle.     We mustand will win the battle of coal next winter,  just as wemust beat world famine, in order that all else we do maynot be upset.      That is why the Government has taken the hard decision to ration bread.     We will not run risks withthe notion &apos;s food..      7/e are determined to maintain fair sharesall round.

At the core of our difficulties is the truth that.,to do all we want to do and need, to do,   there really are not enough of us,      If some of you   married women in areas short ofworkers could manage to corns hack into industry   or a few months and give us a hand,  and some of the   older ones among us, whoindeed have earned a rest, would carry on their war effort alittle longer,  it would he a great help.      More men in the mines,more women in textiles would he a blessing just new,I could give you more figuresj  all very necessary and. very useful in their place, but tonight&apos; I want to get behind the figures.      Export totals and man-power targets may mean alot for human happiness, but after all they are simply moans  toan end.      So tonight - and. after all it&apos; s a .3 unlay - l&apos;m going toskip all that and talk about you and me    an-I the rest and our attitude to living together in a community.If we look back in history, ever since Magna Carta,or earlier,  there has been in the minds of Euglistrmeii an unspokenpromise that some day there would &quot;be a real Merrie England andthat every Englishman, whatever his condition, was somehowentitled to a share in the fulfilment of this&apos;promise.     As theUnited Kingdom and then the Empire and finally the- Commonwealthhave evolved, this living but unspoken promise has taken graduallyclearer shape.      Even now we can&apos;t define it too definitely, butwe can see its fulfilment almost within our grasp, thanks to thepolitical wisdom and civilisation which we have bull, up overthe generations and the immense new technical instruments at our disposal.Generations back we used to be great people forinsisting on our rights - and we still are.-      What it seems tome we have learnt is that standing on one&apos;s rights, although very good and Very necessary,  is not quite enough,     he \. -1 only haveto claim a certain right, we also have to make s re that we actso that the result we want will actually happen.      Rights mean --Aif they are to be upheld - that we must create a living pattern of civilisation into which they fit.      We have always had a greatdistrust of people who want to pat down their rights in blackand white on a piece of paper and leave it at that, and I think:events have justified that distrust,.If we look round the world,, we still see immensegroups, of people clinging to ideas which just do not fit intothis mid-20th century at all,      We see all over  the world -peopledesperately in need of goods and food, while  the producers ofgoods and food in every    country are still fearful after theexperience of last time that what they produce may find no buyers.Here at home, with enough jobs in front of is tc keep us all busyfor many years,  in most parts of the country^  employers and workers are still haunted from time to time by slump psychology, which makes them unwilling to sweep away restrictive practices and takethe brake right off the productive machine.      As we enter this new peace,  our hopes and expectations are coloured perhaps more by what happened last time than by a real awareness of the dangersand possibilities in front of us.      In 19.19 the nation was fatallyled astray by the anxiety of many people  tp get back to 1913.This time few people want to get back to the world of the years between the wars.      In trying to go forward we are all hampered by the difficulty of seeing clearly what to go forward to.I think we in Britain more than any other people hold

the key to the question whether the world in future is going tohe mad or sane.      Other peoples have learnt to respect ourcommonsense and fairness and our capacity to find practicalcompromises.      The whole world is facing the dilemma betweenorder without freedom and liberty with chaos.      If we can show how to combine order with liberty, we will hove invented some-thing as revolutionary as some of the previous social inventionswhich we have given the world,  such as our Parliamentary system,trade unionism and the Commonwealth 03? self-governing peoples.Any government, which has the power,  could plansuccessfully by trampling on liberty-    any government also canuphold liberty and free enterprise rat the price of toleratingchaos.      We alone of the major Powers are launched on the experiment of far-reaching planning with full individual freedom.Logically you can easily prove that it can1t be done, but we inthis country have never been deterred by logical objections,The questions we ask are:    is it fair, and will it work?It will work if we keep our heads, think   out ourproblems and look ahead,  all understand what we are doing and how our individual effort fits into the big national effort,and then all pull together.      It  is a big   ncJ  complicated job,calling for a lot of careful planning, but we are doing it.Economic planning is still at the experimental, stage,  and we must expect to make mistakes and sometimes to be defeated in our efforts,  just as we had to fa.ee defeats early in the war ormore lately in fighting world famine.      But if we suffer defeats,they will not be the last word.      We shall learn our lesson,  andturn defeat into victory in the next round.The Government will do its part but yours is just as important.      Most of the requirements which British industryand agriculture will be striving to meet are   being decided by     4you day by day and&apos; hour by hour through the ordinary economicprocesses.      The remainder are collective requirements decided by the Government with the authority of Parliament;.       Togetherthese requirements form the basis of the British way of life.But if from one standpoint you are the people who decide therequirements, from another you are equally the people who fulfilthem.      Don11 be token in by -labels such as the &quot;State&quot;  and.&quot;industry&quot; and &quot;Nationalisation&quot;.      In themselves and of them-selves they mean little.      Whether these things work, whetherthey give us what we all so firmly desire anal so well deserve,all depends on the sum of what each of us does.      Let us  increase our national income - or,  in other words,  the goods and services which make it up - as fast as we can.      Let us expand exportsso that we can bring more good things in an Imports from over-seas.      But let us remember all the time that the key to these things is not kept    in some safe in Whitehall,  or in somelaboratory where scientists peer into complicated technicalmysteries.    The key is just people doing things together - things that are fair and decent and make commonsense.      Any moral leader-ship and any economic prosperity that we have,  or look forward toin the world,  depend on that.      If we look after it everythingelse will follow-    if we do not, all the other efforts we can makewill be in the long run   futile.So let us produce all we can,   confident that the fruits of our labour will be ours,  and that extra effort nowmeans better living sooner.
