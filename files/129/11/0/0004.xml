(3     5* (&quot;-*&quot;v .PIS DOCUMENT  IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITaNJIC MAJESTY;&apos;S GOVERNMENT)ii ,i -V&apos;&quot;1SECRET COPY NO.  __C..P.   (46)  S541ST JULY,   1946CABINETTHE SOCIAL SURVEYMemorandum &quot;by the Lord President of the council I was invited by the Cabinet on the 1st April to give further consideration,  in the light of their discussion,  tothe proposal to continue the Social Survey as a Governmentagency,  and thereafter to report revised proposals to theCabinet (C.;M.   (46) 29th Conclusions, Minute 10).      I thoughtthat my bust course would be to arrange for the matter tobe considered &quot;by the Committee on Home Information Services,and in the careful examination which they have made of thesubject they have given special attention to the points raised in the Cabinet discussion.2.        The main point about which doubts were felt was,  Ithink,  the question whether it would not be enough to rely on commercial agencies to carry out ouch survey work as      twas necessary,  and it was suggested that there should be someenquiry into the reasons why when the Social Survey was available.the Ministry of Food and the Board of Trade proposedto spend large sums through outside agencies,.3.        The Committee on Home Information Services had beforethem a report on a further interdepartmental examinationmade by the Treasury.      They were satisfied that the social survey technique is a useful instrument of modernadministration, which a large number of Departments areemploying and propose to continue to employ,  and that although the existing organisation may need to be modifiedit is nevertheless essential that there should be a centralGovernment agency to co-ordinate activities in this field and.to carry out the work (except in special cases where it maybe necessary or more convenient to put the work out to contract),4. As regards the alternatives to using a central agency,the Committee considered, that this work, requiring as it doesspecialised treatment,  could not be done efficiently oreconomically through existing departmental machinery,  andthat the volume of work is such as to make it more economicalto use a central Government organisation than commercialagencies.      There are, moreover,  some enquiries for which itwould, be undesirable to employ outside agencies-.5. The Committee thought that the ultimate aim should beto entrust all new surveys to the Social Survey,  save in quiteexceptions.! circumstances, and ultimately, with a few exceptions, to transfer all existing Government survey work toit.      It came to the conclusion, however,  that in view of theserious objections to interrupting the continuity of the enquiries

already in train,  andSurvey could not takework, it would Toe rightsince for the time being the Socialon any considerable additions to itso.v r.:v,uiuvA V;v i-iC5J.iL, to allow the Ministry of Food andthe Board of Trade to continue to &quot;contract out&quot; for thepresent,  certainly as regards existing enquiries.      but after it has been reorganised,  the question should be examined by the Treasury with a view to the assumption bythe Social Survey, as soon as possible, of any new surveysand to the ultimate transfer to it of existing surveywork, subject to the exceptions in special cases contemplatedabove and to provision for the use of outside agencieswhere the survey itself is already fully extended.6. I ask the Cabinet to approve the following revised proposals, which have been approved &quot;by the Committee on home Information Services:--(i)(ii)(iii)The Social Survey should be continued on about its present scale under the Central Office ofInformation, the precise arrangements to besubject to review at the end of two years.(iv)The organisation and establishment of theexisting Social Survey should be reviewedits personnel should become civil servant.;andThe Social Survey should be restricted to meeting approved requests for factualsociological inquiries from GovernmentDepartments, and also, subject t&apos;o adequatepriority for these requirements,  from tGovernmental (but non-departmental)organisations and,  in special circumstances,from non-Governmental bodies.      The work wouldbe carried out for Government departments as an allied service and for other bodies ona repayment basis.-entrust all new surveysexcept in quite exceptionalThe    aim should be toto the Social Surveycircumstances and ultimately, with a few exceptions,  to transfer all Government surveywork to it.     But for the time being those departments, such as the Ministry of Food andthe Board of Trade, which have continuouslong standing surveys  carried out by commercialfirms should be free to continue these arrangements.      after the Social Survey hasbeen reorganised,  the Treasury should examinethe question of the assumption by it as soonas possible of.any new surveys and the ultimatetransfer to it of existing survey work,&quot;Contracting out&quot; should only be allowed inapproved, cases in the same way as for other activities of the Central Office ofInfer mat ion.Privy Council Office,  S.W.,1.1st July, 1946.H.M.
