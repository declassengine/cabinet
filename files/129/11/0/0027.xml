THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT-- ^Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1946SECRET. Copy No.   3 8CP. (46) 277.)     11th July, 1946.CABINET.96TIMBER FOR HOUSING.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.I feel obliged to bring to the attention of my colleagues the questions of thesupply and cost of timber, because of their effect on our housing programme. I ask that the inclusion of arrangements for the importation of adequate suppliesof timber suitable for house building should be recognised as an urgent necessity,and the Government should take all possible action to this end.2. At the present time the cost of timber is 198 per cent, and the cost ofjoinery is 191 per cent, above the 1939 figure. The average increase in the costof the other materials being 76 per cent. The increase in the cost of timber andjoinery alone represents an additional cost of  104 per house. This increase isafter allowing for a subsidy towards present costs of timber borne by the centralExchequer. Moreover, there are already serious difficulties in supply. During&quot;the present year the effect of the timber shortage on the housing programmemay be masked by an immediate shortage of other materials and componentswhich are home produced. Action is being taken to step-up the production ofthese materials and components to meet the needs of an expanded long-term programme. It would be disastrous if that action were stultified by a shortageof timber which is essential to housing, and for which We must look to importsfrom abroad, or if our efforts first to stabilise and then reduce house building costs were frustrated by the continuance of exceptionally high costs for one item alone.3. The success of a large-scale long-term housing programme depends onthe existence of adequate supplies, indeed of surpluses, of those materials whichare most efficient and most economical for house building. Timber is essentiallyone of these materials and no substitute has been found which can adequatelyreplace it. Steel, which can to some extent be used in place of timber, is more expensive, whilst the Minister of Supply has himself drawn attention to &quot;the increasing tightness of the Iron and Steel position &quot; (L.P. (46) 168).4. For our supplies of timber we depend upon other countries, primarilyRussia, including the former Baltic States, Finland, Sweden, Germany and canada. I understand that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster will be making a report to the Overseas Reconstruction Committee on the working ofthe arrangements for obtaining timber from Germany. These arrangements are already much behind schedule and in the interests of housing I wish toemphasise the necessity of obtaining increased amounts from Germany, and of ensuring by the most ruthless administrative action the supply of these increasedamounts in accordance with a prescribed schedule and time-table. The scheduleitself should be drawn up on the basis of maximum help to this country.5. I must emphasise to my colleagues that without the assistance of Russiaand increasing supplies from Sweden we are unlikely to be able to secureadequate supplies of building timber in this country. In the years immediately preceding the war Russia, together with the former Baltic States, supplied some25 per cent, of the total imports of softwood building timber. Russia, through its reparations policy towards Finland, also influences the volume of Finnishexports, which over the same period amounted also to 25 per cent, of the total.[32151]
Ministry of Health, S.W. 1.17th July, 1946.Russia, the former Baltic States and Finland between them, therefore, accountedfor half of the imports of building timber into this country. I ask mycolleagues to agree that in discussions with Russia the inclusion of arrangementsfor the import of softwood building timber should be treated as an urgent necessity. As regards Sweden my colleagues must appreciate that an increasein the rate of supplies depends largely upon an increase in the supplies of coalthat can be made available.A. B.
