ill        S- tr^..49(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)SECRET*1CP. (46)   263 COPY NO.__8TH JULY,   1946.cabinet paper FOR FASCIST BOOK PUBLISHERSMemorandum &quot;by the Lord president of the council. At their meeting on 5th July (L.P.(46)24th Meeting,Minute 5)  the Lord president&apos;s Committee had before them(i)    a memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary to theBoard of Trade (L. P. (46)159)  referring to anapplication for a quota of paper for bookpublishing which the Beard of Trade had received,from a firm of -publishers called Abbey SuppliesLimited which had, before the war, published bookson behalf of the British Union of Fascists.Sir Oswald Mosley had. joined with rep-resentat ivesof the firm in making application for the paper   ,quota and it was reasonably clear that the quotawould be used for the publication of Fascist books.The memorandum pointed out that,,   in the absence ofa policy of political censorship,  there appearedto be no alternative but to grant the quota of paper, and(ii)    a memorandum-by the Home Secretary (L.F.(46)161)pointing out that it had recently been decided, notto attempt to impose a political censorship onFascist publications and that if this decision wereto be reversed it should be by powers specificallyconferred for the purpose and not by the use of aneconomic control granted for entirely differentpurposes.2.      It has &quot;been the practice of the Raw MaterialsDe-partment of the Board of Trade,  through the paper Control,to allow all book publishers who used paper in the twelvemonths before the  institution of control to have a quota of paper based on their consumption during that period.      more recently there has been established a minimum book quota oftwo tons of paper in a four-months&apos;   licence period.      AbbeySupplies Limited would thus receive two tons in each four months.      in establishing quotas the Control take no accountof the type of publication which the- publisher concernedhas issued in the past or might  issue  in the future.

3.      My colleagues will recollect that the Committee ofMinisters which recently looked into the question ofFascism considered that  it would he contrary to democratic principles to try to suppress Fascist doctrines and thatthe law was strong enough to deal&apos;with any dangerouslyseditious literature which the Fascists might publish.These views were endorsed by the Cabinet on the 8th april last (C. M. (45) 31st Conclusions, Minute 3).4.      The Lord President&apos;s Committee agreed that,  under theexisting arrangements and in the absence of a policy ofpolitical censorship,  there did not appear to be anycourse open to the Board, of Trade but to allow the firm tohave the quota of paper to which it was entitled in theordinary way.5.      As there may ho sharp controversy in Parliament andthe country, the decision is being submitted to theCabinet for approval.H. M.Privy Council Office.S.W.I.8TH JULY,  1946
