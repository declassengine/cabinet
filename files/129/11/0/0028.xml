(o o^h--THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1946.SECRET. Copy No. 3 8. ,.1,1.      I,        i..........i - -ACP. (46) 278.11th July, 1946.CABINET.ADMISSION OF NON-EUROPEAN PERSONNEL INTO THE UNITEDKINGDOM FORCES.Joint Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and theSecretary of State for India.WE have recently been in correspondence with Service Ministers over the entry of men of non-European race into the United Kingdom regular forces. Ithas been our contention that British subjects and British protected persons should not be automatically excluded from entry into these forces on grounds ofcolour. The present position is that, as a result of our approaches, the Secretaryof State for Air has agreed to permit the entry of non-European applicants intothe post-war Air Force, provided that they attain the requisite standards, areresident in this country at the time of application, and can satisfy the selectionauthorities that they are likely to mix with other entrants and hold their ownin the corporate life of the Service; but that the First Lord of the admiralty and the Secretary of State for War are not willing to make a similar concessionfor the Royal Navy and the Army. Since, in our opinion, this ban on non-Europeans is contrary to the declared policy of His Majesty&apos;s government towards the peoples of India, Burma and the Colonial Empire, we feel that thereis no alternative but to place the matter before the Cabinet. We hope that our colleagues will agree that the Navy and Army should come into line with theRoyal Air Force over this question.2. The past history of this subject is very briefly as follows : Before thewar, there was an acknowledged ban on the entry of non-Europeans into all three services. This was lifted in the first months of the war and non-Europeansadmitted, not only as other ranks, but also as temporary commissioned officers,into all three Services. It is hardly necessary to remind our colleagues that manyof them rendered distinguished service.3. Our predecessors were all exceedingly anxious that there should be noreturn to the pre-1939 ban on non-European entrants. They felt as stronglyas we do that it was impossible to defend this plain example of the colour bar,and they made several approaches to Service Ministers on the question duringthe war. Service Ministers felt themselves unable to come to a decision at thattime, but, in November 1945, the Secretary of State for Air informed us thatthe Air Council had agreed to admission of non-European candidates into thepost-war Air Force on the conditions stated in paragraph 1 above.4. The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for War,in refusing to agree to similar arrangements for the Navy and Army, have cometo the conclusion that the practical difficulties in the admission of non-Europeancandidates are too great. They have pointed out that British soldiers and sailorsdo not take kindly to being commanded by coloured officers; that there are obvioussocial difficulties; that a policy of admitting coloured men to the UnitedKingdom forces might not be understood in the countries where the Navy and army had to serve; and that it would certainly cause embarrassment in someDominions. They suggest that men of colour wanting to follow a militaryprofession must enter local forces.[32154]
5. We do not wish to minimise the practical difficulties mentioned above,but we feel that they should not be decisive. If, as we recommend, the other two Services come into line with the Royal Air Force, the number of candidateseligible for entry will be very small and successful applications will no doubt onlybe a handful in the year. It can hardly seriously be argued that the admissionof a few non-Europeans into the Navy or Army in any year can make an appreciable difference to the efficiency or well-being of these forces; on the otherhand, automatic exclusion on the ground of colour, even of a few candidates, mayhave serious political consequences.6. Nor do we think that it can be maintained there is sufficient outlet, exceptin India and Burma, for non-Europeans in local forces. Colonial military forces are in all cases small, and in many Colonies Colonial naval and air forces do not exist. Further, one class of person at present barred from entry to the UnitedKingdom permanent forces, viz., the coloured man who has been born and brought up in this country, could not be expected to apply for entry to local forces overseas.7. Apart from any question of practical difficulties, we feel that this isa matter which must be considered against the background of Imperial policyin the widest sense. The future of this country may well turn upon the successwith which we can ensure the co-operation of hitherto dependent territories, asthey achieve self-government, in upholding and presenting to the world Britishideals and the British outlook upon social and political problems. The desire for such co-operation on their part cannot be encouraged by regulations whichreflect the old attitude of racial superiority.8. Some interest has already been shown in Parliament on this issue and questions have been put to the Service Ministers.G. H. H.P.-L.Colonial Office, S.W.1,India Office, S.W. 1,12th July, 1946.
