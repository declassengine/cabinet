mmPros 1 dent    Truman&apos;s Statements, on the admission of 100,000 Jewish Inarrjgr cultsto Palestine1.      The proposal for an immediate grant of 100,000certificates for Jewish immigration to Palestine was firstendorsed toy President Truman in a letter to the Prime minister dated 31st July,  1945.      This letter drew attention to thereport on the  condition of displaced persons in the western zones of Germany,  with particular reference to Jews,  whichhad recently &quot;been submitted to the president toy Mr.  EarlHarrison,  and continued as follows:&quot;It appears that the available certificates for&quot; irnmigr at ion to Palestine will toe exhausted in the near&quot;future.    It is suggested that the granting of an additional&quot;one hundred thousand of such certificates would contribute&quot;greatly to a sound solution for the future of Jews still&quot;in Germany and Austria,  and for other Jewish refugees who-&quot;do not wish to remain where they are or who for&quot;understandable  reasons do not desire to return to their&quot;countries of origin......   If it is to be effective,  such&quot;action should not be long delayed. &quot;2.      Two weeks before writing this letter,  on 17th August,president Truman had informed a press conference that theofficial American view on Palestine was that  &quot;we want to letas many of the Jews into Palestine as it is possible to letinto the country and still maintain civil peace&quot;.    He addedthat he had no intention of sending 500,000 American troops to keep the peace  in Palestine.3.      On 29th September the white House revealed theexistence and the nature of the president&apos;s letter of31st August.4.      In London,  the Cabinet decided on 4th. October toexamine a -proposal that the United States Government shouldtoe invited to join in the formation of an  Anglo-american committee of Enquiry to investigate the -problems of EuropeanJewry and of Palestine.5,      When President Truman announced the agreement of thetwo Governments on this proposal,  on loth November,  he alsopublished the text  of his letter to the prime Minister and declared that  &quot;I continue to adhere to the views expressedin that letter&quot;.6.      The Report of the Anglo-Amerlean Committee was published in Washington on the evening of 30th April,  1946*It was immediately followed toy a Presidential statement whichread in part as follows;-&quot;I am very happy that the request which I made for the&quot;immediate admission of 100,000 Jews  into Palestine has been&quot;unanimously endorsed toy the Anglo-American Committee of&quot;Enquiry.    The transference of these unfortunate people should&quot;now-toe accomplished with the greatest despatch.....   I am&quot;also pleased that the Committee recommends in-effect the

&quot;abrogation of the White Paper of 1939 including&quot;existing restrictions on immigration and land&quot;acquisition to permit the further development of the&quot;Jewish national home.........   In addition to these&quot;immediate objectives the report deals with many other&quot;questions of long range political policies and questions&quot;of international law which require careful study and&quot;which I will take under advisement. &quot;7.      On the following day the prime Minister,  in the courseof a statement to the House of Commons,  said that &quot;the Reportmust be considered as a whole and in all its implications&quot;.8.      The prime Minister again stated this position in thecourse of an exchange of messages with the Presidentconcerning the arrangements for conversations between officials of the two Governments on the implications of theAnglo-Americon Committee&apos; s Report.    Neverthelesspresident Truman sent an advance party to discuss thetechnical and. financial problems involved in a possiblemovement of 100,000 Jews from Europe to Palestine, and with no mandate to examine any other of the Anglo-american committee&apos;s recommendations.      (The advance party has now returned to Washington,  and the officials who will discussthe recotnmendations as a whole are expected in London thisweek).9.      On 3rd July? four days after the British authoritiesin Palestine had initiated counter-measures against Zionistterrorism and sabotage,  the President received the fourAmerican members of the Jewish Ag-ency Executive.    A statement was subsequently issued from the white House,  containing asummary of the President&apos;s declarations to them.    Thestatement reads in part:&quot;The President added further that it was his&quot;determination that these most recent events should, mean&apos;no delay in pushing forward with a policy of transferring*100,000 Jewish immigrants to Palestine with all despatch&apos;in accordance with the  statement he made upon the receipt&quot;of the Report of the Anglo-American Committee  of Enquiry.&quot;The President indicated that the Government of the&quot;United States was prepared to assume to clinical and&quot;financial responsibility for the transportation of these&quot;Immigrants from Europe to Palestine.&quot;
