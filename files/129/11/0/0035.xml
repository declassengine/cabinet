A period from the outbreak of the war until a date 18 months afterthe coming into force of the present Treaty shall be excluded in considering thetime within which a patent should be worked or a design or trade mark used.3. The period from the outbreak of the war until the coming into forceof the present Treaty shall be excluded from the normal term of rights in industrial, literary and artistic property which were in force in Italy at theoutbreak of the war or which are recognised or established under this Annexand belonging to any of the Allied and Associated Powers, or their nationals.Consequently, the normal duration of such rights shall be deemed automaticallyextended in Italy for a further term corresponding to the period so excluded.4. The foregoing provisions concerning the rights of the Allied andAssociated Powers or their nationals shall apply equally to Italy and its nationals,[but nothing in these provisions shall operate so as to give to Italy or any ofits nationals greater rights than are accorded in like cases by any of the allied or Associated Powers to any other of the United Nations.]The Union of Soviet Socialist Reptiblics Delegation considers it unnecessary to include the passage in brackets.The United States Delegation would not agree to this Annex unless para-graph 4 were included in its entirety.5. Third parties in the territories of any of the Allied and associated powers or Italy who before the coming into force of the present Treaty havebona. fide acquired industrial property rights conflicting with rights restoredunder this Article or with rights obtained with priority claimed thereunder,or have bona fide manufactured, used or sold, the subject-matter of such rights,shall be permitted, without any liability for infringement, to continue to exercise such rights and to continue or to resume suCh manufacture, use or sale whichhad been bona fide acquired or commenced.

Upon the application of any interested person who is a national of oneof the United Nations the Conciliation Commission shall order the restoration ofthe rights which have been prejudiced by the measures of execution referred toin paragraph 2 wherever such restoration is equitable and possible. If suchrestoration is inequitable or impossible the Conciliation Commission may awardcompensation to the prejudiced party to be paid by the Italian Government.4.

Consequently,the normal duration of such rights shall be deemed automatically extended in roumania for a further term corresponding to the period so excluded.4. The foregoing provisions concerning the rights of the Allied andAssociated Powers or their nationals shall apply equally to Roumania and its nationals [but nothing in these provisions shall operate so as to give to Roumaniaor any of its nationals greater rights than are accorded in like cases by any ofthe Allied or Associated Powers to any other of the United Nations].The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Delegation considers it unnecessary to include the passage in brackets.The United States Delegation would not agree to this Annex unlessparagraph 4 were included in its entirety.Category VI.Asphyxiating, lethal, toxic, incapacitating substances intended for war purposes, or manufactured in excess of civilian requirements.Category VII.Propellants, explosives, pyrotechnics, liquefied gases destined for the propul-sion, explosion, charging, filling of, or use in connection with the war material in the present categories, not capable of civilian use or manufactured in excessof civilian requirements.Category VIII.Factory and total equipment specially designed for the production and main-tenance of the products enumerated above and not technically inconvertible to civilian use.
5. Third parties in the territories of any of the Allied and associated powers or Roumania who before the coming into force of the present Treaty havebona fide acquired industrial property rights conflicting with rights restoredunder this Article or with rights obtained with priority claimed thereunder, or have bona fide manufactured, used or sold the subject-matter or such rights, shallbe permitted without any liability for infringement, to continue to exercise such rights and to continue or to resume such manufacture, use or sale which hadbeen bona fide acquired or commenced. In Roumania, such permission shall take the form of a non-exclusive licence granted on terms and conditions to be mutually agreed by the parties thereto or in default of agreement to be fixed bythe Conciliation Commission established under Article 31 of the Treaty. In the territories of the Allied and Associated Powers, however, bona fide third parties shall receive such protection as is accorded under similar circumstances to bonafide third parties whose rights are in conflict with those of the nationals of other allied and Associated Powers.6. Nothing in this Annex shall be construed to entitle Roumania or its nationals to any patent or utility model rights in the territory of any of theAllied and Associated Powers with respect to inventions relating to any articlelisted by name in the definition of war material contained in Annex 3 of thepresent Treaty made or upon which application were filed by Roumania or anyof its nationals in Roumania or in the territory of any other of the Axis powers or in any territory occupied by the Axis forces, during the time when the placein question was under the control of enemy forces or authorities.7. [Roumania shall extend the benefits of this Article to any United Nationother than an Allied or Associated Power which undertakes to extend to roumania the benefits accorded to Roumania under this Article.]The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Delegation does not see the reasonfor inclusion of paragraph 7 in the present Treaty.8.   Nothing in this Annex shall be understood to conflict with Articles 24,26 and 28 of the present Treaty.B. Insurance.United Kingdom proposal: 1[1. United Nations Insurers shall be granted full facilities by theRoumanian Government to recover their former portfolios of business in roumania, and they shall not be required to conform to any legislative enact-ments more onerous than those which were applicable to them before the outbreakof war.2. In so far as the guarantee deposits and reserves of United NationsInsurers have been reduced by reason of the payment of insurance claims arisingout of the war they shall be entitled to compensation from the roumanian government by way of the reinstatement of such deposits or reserves to theamount of the claims.3. The Roumanian Government undertakes that if any United NationsInsurer desires to resume business in Roumania and it is found that the value ofany guarantee deposit or reserves required to be held as a condition of carryingon business in Roumania have been diminished by reason of disappearance ordepreciation of the securities in which they are constituted, Roumania shalleither (a) itself reconstitute the deposits or reserves except in so far as the diminution or disappearance was caused by payment of losses alreadycompensated for under paragraph 2 above; or(b) accept the securities at the value at the outbreak of war for the purposeof compliance with the legal requirements relating to such deposits and reserves.]The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Delegation considers that thissubject is also covered by Article 24 on United Nations property in roumania and see no reason to include any special provisions relating to Insurance.The United States Delegation is not opposed in principle to treaty provisions ion special problems relating to insurance but is unable to accept the draft as 1a whole.
C. Shipping.United Kingdom proposal: [1. The expression &quot; property &quot; includes all vessels of the United Nations,with full inventory, equipment and cargoes which were in the waters of roumania or Roumanian territorial waters of the Danube on the 22nd June, 1941.Vessels falling into the following categories are regarded as belonging to a united Nation or United Nations national: *(i) If on the 22nd June, 1941 (at the time they fell under Roumaniancontrol), they were registered in the territory of a United Nation,(ii) If on the 22nd June, 1941 (at the time they fell under Roumaniancontrol) they had the right to fly the flag of a United Nation whetheror not formally registered in the territory of that Nation,(iii) If, after the 22nd June, 1941, they were built in Roumania by, or for.or acquired by, any national of a United Nation, and registered inits territory (if liable to registration).2. The Roumanian Government is responsible for handing over inRoumanian territorial waters the vessels of the United Nations in complete good order as they existed on the 22nd June, 1941, and within a period of one month from the coming into force of this Treaty and to pay fair compensation for theloss of use and loss of profits from the 22nd June, 1941, up to the date of the handing over of the vessels. In the event of the Roumanian Government failing to hand over within the time limit laid down the Roumanian Government shall pay further compensation in the currency of the United Nation concerned forsuch further loss of use and profits up to the date of handing over of the vessels.3. The Roumanian Government undertakes to restore the vessels in goodnavigable condition including the carrying out of repairs shown to be necessary by an expert survey^1) Up to the time of handing over all damages or defectsfound in the vessels are the sole responsibility of the Roumanian Government.The Roumanian Government accepts that the return of such vessels is withoutprejudice to any rights or remedies provided in any other Articles of this Treatyrelating to the payment of compensation in respect of any acts or omission ofthe Roumanian Government or its nationals.4. Where United Nations vessels have been lost these are to be valued at replacement cost and vessels of a similar category delivered to the same value;if the Roumanian Government should be unable to deliver from existing vessels,the required vessels are to be constructed either in Roumanian shipyards or elsewhere, the responsibility for payment resting with the Roumanian Govern-ment.]The United-States and French Delegations consider it desirable that thePeace Conference include in the Treaty a definition of the ships to which theArticle on United Nations Property will apply but believe the other provisionsproposed on this subject are unnecessary.The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Delegation considers that thissubject is also covered by Article 24 on United Nations property in roumania and sees no reason to include any special provisions relating to shipping.D. Petroleum.United Kingdom proposal: [1. The complete restoration and replacement of damaged or destroyedproperty belonging to United Nations nationals engaged in the petroleum industryin Roumania shall receive priority over the restoration or replacement of otherproperty in the petroleum industry of Roumania, and failing the completerestoration or replacement of damaged or destroyed property of United nation nationals within a period of one year from the date of the coming into forceof this Treaty, the Roumanian Government undertakes to pay to such united nations nationals convertible currency equivalent to the assessed value of theproperty which the Roumanian Government failed to restore or replace.(M Repairs to be done in Roumania or if outside Roumania the cost to be to the charge ofthe Roumanian Government who must provide the necessary foreign exchange.
2. The roumanian Government accepts to compensate United nation nationals engaged in the petroleum industry in Roumania for all reasonableexpenses incurred in preparation for and in execution of provisional repairs and replacements to the damaged property of United Nations Nationals, duringthe war and since the signing of the Armistice and until such time as completerestoration or replacement of damaged or destroyed property has been effected.3. The Roumanian Government undertakes to repeal the Petroleum law of July 1942 and to re-enact the Mining Law of 1937 pending the coming intoforce of a new petroleum law.4. United Nations nationals engaged in the petroleum industry of Roumaniareserve the right to demand the revocation of any acts, deeds, or titles deriving from the Petroleum Law of 1942 which they consider prejudicial to their interestsand.the Roumanian Government will implement such revocations free of costand free of encumbrances to the United Nations nationals.5. The Roumanian Government shall compensate Roumanian nationals who may suffer damage through the implementation of the revocations mentioned inparagraph 4.6. Ad &quot;rights acquired&quot; by United Nations nationals under each and every mining law and petroleum law in Roumania shall be maintained at therequest of the United Nations nationals concerned.7. All expenses incurred by United Nations nationals engaged in the petroleum industry of Roumania such as bank charges and interest on loans raised to facilitate on behalf of the Roumanian Government deliveries of petroleum products to the Axis Powers during the war shall be borne by the roumanian government.8. In order to facilitate the rehabilitation and maintenance of the propertyof United Nations nationals, engaged in the petroleum industry of Roumania,the Roumanian Government undertakes to make the necessary alterations in thelabour law to allow all employees selected by such United Nations nationals toenter Roumania and to exercise their respective professions in the petroleumindustry of Roumania without hindrance.]The United States Delegation considers that the problems sought to be dealtwith in the draft Annex on Petroleum would, in general, be covered by the general provisions agreed on United Nations property, if these provisions made adequate provision for compensation.The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Delegation considers that thissubject is also covered by Article 24 on United Nations property in roumania and sees no reason to include any special provisions relating to petroleum.ANNEX 5.[Contracts, Prescriptions and Negotiable Instruments.](x)United Kingdom proposal : I. Contracts.[1. Any contract concluded between enemies shall be deemed to have been dissolved as from the time when any of the parties became an enemy, except inrespect of any debt accrued or money paid or other pecuniary obligation arisingout of any act done thereunder, and subject to the exceptions set out in thefollowing paragraph. The provisions of this paragraph shall be without preju-dice to contracts of insurance and reinsurance, which shall be subject to a separate agreement.(Alternatively a special annex can be included.)(&apos;) In view of the constitutional position of the Federal Government,, the United states delegation would be unable to accept any obligations on the matters covered by this Annex.The United States would not object to the inclusion of provisions on these subjects in the treaty,but would wish to have a clause included making them inapplicable as between the United Statesand Roumania.The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Delegation sees no reason for inclusion in thepeace treaty of the matters covered by this Annex.The French Delegation supports the United Kingdom proposal with regard to prescriptionsand negotiable instruments.
2. The following classes of contracts notwithstanding the provisions of para-graph 1 are excepted from dissolution and without prejudice to the rightscontained in Article 26, remain in force subject to the application of municipallaws, orders or regulations made since the outbreak of war by any member of theUnited Nations and subject to the proper law and terms of the contracts : (a) Contracts for the transfer of estates or of movable or immovable propertywhere the property therein has passed or delivery been made before theparties became enemies;(b) Leases or agreements for leases of land, houses or parts thereof;(c) Contracts of mortgages or lien;Id) Concessions of mines, quarries or deposits;(e) Contracts between individuals or associations and states, municipalitiesor other similar juridical persons charged with administrativefunctions and concessions granted by states, municipalities or other similar juridical persons charged with administrative functions;(/) Any contract of which the execution shall be required in the general interest within six months from the date of the coming into force ofthe present treaty by a government of one of the United Nations ofwhich one of the parties to such a contract is a national; when theexecution of the contract thus kept alive would, owing to the alterationof particular conditions, cause one of the parties substantial prejudice,the Conciliation Commission established under article 31 shall beempowered to award fair compensation to the prejudiced parties.3. If a contract is dissolved in part under paragraph 1, the remainingprovisions of that contract shall, subject to the same application of municipallaws as is provided for in paragraph 2, continue in force if they are severable, but where they are not severable the contract shall be deemed to have been dissolvedin its entirety.4.

Upon the application of any interested person who is a national of oneof the United Nations, the Conciliation Commission shall order the restoration ofthe rights which have been prejudiced by the measures of execution referred to inparagraph 2 wherever such restoration is equitable and possible. If such restora-tion is inequitable or impossible, the Conciliation Commission may award com-pensation to the prejudiced party to be paid by the Roumanian Government.4. Where a contract between enemies has been dissolved by reason either of failure on the part of either party to carry out its provisions or of the exercise
of.a right stipulated in the contract itself the party prejudiced may apply to theConciliation Commission for relief. The Commission will have the powersprovided for in paragraph 3.5.   The provisions of the preceding paragraphs of this Article shall applyto the United Nations nationals who have been prejudiced by reason of measures referred above taken by Roumania or invaded or occupied territory, if they havenot been otherwise satisfactorily compensated.6. Roumania shall compensate any third party who may be prejudiced byany restitution or restoration ordered by the Conciliation Commission under theprovisions of the preceding paragraphs of this Part.7.

As between enemies, no negotiable instrument made before the warshall be deemed to have become invalid by reason only of failure within the required time to present the instrument for acceptance or payment or to give notice of non-acceptance or non-payment to drawers or endorsers or to protestthe instrument, nor by reason of failure to complete any formality during the war.2. Where the period within which a negotiable instrument should have been presented for acceptance or for payment, or within which notice of non-aceptanceor non-payment should have been given to the drawer or endorser, or withinwhich the instrument should have been protested, has elapsed during the war,and the party who should have presented or protested the instrument or havegiven notice of non-acceptance or non-payment has failed to do so during the war,a period of not less than three months from the coming into force of the presentTreaty shall be allowed within which presentation, notice of non-acceptance ornon-payment or protest may be made.3.

Where the period within which a negotiable instrument should havebeen presented for acceptance or for payment, or within which notice of non-acceptance or non-payment should have been given to the drawer or endorseror within which the instrument should have been protested, has elapsed duringthe war, and the party who should have presented or protested the instrument or have given notice of non-acceptance or non-payment has failed to do so duringthe war, a period of not less than three months from the coming into force of thepresent Treaty shall be allowed within which presentation, notice of non-acceptance or non-payment or protest may be made.3.

Judgments given by the Courts of a member of the United Nations inall cases which, under the present Treaty, they are competent to decide, shall berecognised in Bulgaria as final, and shall be enforced without it being necessaryto have them declared executory.2.

PART V. REPARATION AND RESTITUTION.Article 21.(1)Losses caused to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia by military operations and by the occupation by Hungary of the territories of these states will be indemnified by Hungary to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and yugoslavia, but taking into consideration that Hungary has not only withdrawnfrom&apos; the war against the United Nations but has also declared war on Germany,the Parties agree that compensation for the above losses will be made by Hungarynot in full but only in part, namely, to the amount of 300 million United Statesdollars payable over 8 years from the 20th January, 1945, in commodities(machine equipment, river craft, grain, &amp;c), the sum to be paid to the soviet union to amount to 200 million United States dollars, and the sum to be paidto Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia to amount; to 100 million United States dollars.The basis for calculating the settlement provided for in this Article will bethe American dollar at its gold parity on the day of the signing of the ArmisticeAgreement, i.e., 35 dollars for one ounce of gold.Article 22.1. Hungary accepts the principles of the United Nations Declaration ofthe 5th January, 1943, and will return property removed from United Nationsterritories.2. The obligation to make restitution applies to all identifiable propertyat present in Hungary which was removed by force or duress by any of the axis Powers from the territory of any of the United Nations, irrespective ofany subsequent transactions by which the present holder of any such propertyhas secured possession.3. The Hungarian Government undertakes to return the property referredto in the present Article in good order and, in this connexion, to bear all costs in Hungary relating to labour, materials and transport.4. The Hungarian Government will co-operate with the United Nations in.and will provide at its own expense all necessary facilities for, the search forand restitution of property liable to restitution under the present Article.5.

Claims for the restitution of property shall be presented to the hungarian government by the Government of the country from whose territory the property was removed, it being understood that rolling-stock shall be regarded as havingbeen removed from the territory to which it originally belonged. The period during which such claims may be presented shall be six months from the dateof coming into force of the present Treaty.7. The burden of identifying the property and of proving the originalownership shall rest on the claimant Government and the burden of proving thatthe property was not removed by force or duress shall rest on the hungarian government.(&apos;) The United States Delegation reserves the right to reopen this question at the PeaceConference.At the time of the signature of the Armistice Agreement with Hungary, the United StatesGovernment reserved the right to reopen the question of the execution of Article 12 of that agreement (which deals with reparation) if, in the light of later circumstances, it should befound that American interests were being unwarrantably prejudiced.The United States Government has been concerned regarding general economic conditionsin Hungary, which have deteriorated steadily and which are approaching the point of thecomplete collapse of the economy of the country. When it appeared that this deterioration,to which the heavy burden of the Armistice requirements has contributed, was such as to jeopardise even minimum living standards for the people and to render them unable to play a useful part in world recovery, the United States Government on the 2nd March, 1946, proposedto the other signatories of the Crimea Declaration on Liberated Europe that the situation in hungary be studied with a view to devising a programme which would not only arrest theeconomic disintegration but also provide a framework within which the rehabilitation of thatcountry would be possible. The United States Government regards the economic collapse of any country as affecting American interests. It continues to believe that a study such as it has proposed should be undertaken by a commission composed of representatives of the powers concerned.
PAET VI.-ECONOMIC CLAUSES.Article 23.1. In so far as Hungary has not already done so, Hungary shall restore all thelegal rights and interests in Hungary of the United Nations and their nationalsas they existed on the 10th April, 19-11, and shall return all property in Hungaryof the United Nations and their nationals as it now exists.2. The Hungarian Government undertakes that all property, rights and interests passing under this Article, shall be restored free of all encumbrances and charges of any kind to which they may have become subject as a result of the warand without the imposition of any charges by the Hungarian Government in con-nexion with its return. The Hungarian Government will nullify all measuresincluding seizures, sequestration or control, taken by it against United Nationsproperty between the 10th April, 1941, and the coming into force of the presentTreaty. In cases where the property has not been returned within six monthsof the coming into force of the Treaty, application shall be made to the Hungarianauthorities not later than twelve months from the coming into force of the Treaty,except in cases in which the claimant is able to show that he could not file hisapplication within this period,3. The Hungarian Government undertakes to invalidate transfers involvingproperty, rights and interests of any description belonging to United nation nationals, where such transfers resulted from force or duress exerted by AxisGovernments or their agencies during the war.4.   United States proposal : [(a) Where, as a result of the war, the property cannot be returned or theUnited Nations national has suffered a loss because of injury to the property, the hungarian Government shall compensate the owner by the payment of a sum in local currency sufficient at the date of payment to enable the recipient to purchasesimilar property or to make good the loss or damage suffered.(b) Sums in local currency paid by the Hungarian Government under thisArticle shall be freely usable in Hungary but shall be subject to the foreign exchange control regulations which may be in force in Hungary from time totime. The Hungarian Government agrees to accord to United Nations nationalsfair and equitable treatment with respect to the allocation of materials, and offoreign exchange required for^the importation of materials, for the repair orrehabilitation of their properties in Hungary, and in no event to discriminatein these respects against nationals of the United Nations as compared withHungarian nationals.(c) In cases where a corporation or association of any nationality other thanthat of one of the United Nations has suffered a loss of its property in Hungaryas a result of the war, compensation in local currency shall be paid by the hungarian Government to United Nations nationals who have directly or indirectly through intermediate corporations or associations of any nationalityother than that of one of the United Nations, an ownership interest in thecorporation or association which has suffered the loss. This compensation shallbe that fractional part of the amount which would be required to enable thecorporation or association to make good the loss or damage suffered, which theinterest of the United Nations nationals constitutes of the totality of ownershipinterests in the corporation. Such compensation, however, shall not be requiredin case the Hungarian Government shall, provide to the corporation or theassociation itself such full compensation or restoration as would be due underthis Article if it were a corporation or association of one of the United Nations.In cases where the corporation or association receives from the hungarian government partial compensation for the damage or loss sustained, the united nations nationals shall be paid by the Hungarian Government compensation in local currency in an amount equal to their respective proportionate shares of theioss or damage for which the corporation or association does not itself receive compensation from the Hungarian Government. For purposes of this paragraph the extent of interest of a United Nations national shall be determined as ofthe 10th April, 1941, or the outbreak of war between the United Nation concerned and Hungary, as may be the more favourable to the United Nations national.(d) As used in this Article, the phrase &quot; as a result of the war &quot; includes the consequences of any action taken by the Hungarian Government, any action
taken by any of the belligerents, any action taken under the Armistice of the20th January, 1945, and any action or failure to act caused by the existence ofa state of war.]Union of Soviet Socialist Republics proposal : 1[Hungary recognises the necessity for compensation for the property of theUnited Nations or their nationals in Hungary lost or damaged during the war.In view of the fact, however, that Hungary broke relations with and declared war on Germany and in consideration of the losses sustained by Hungary in thecourse of military operations against Germany on Hungarian territory, it is agreed that such compensation will be made in part to the extent of one thirdof the losses and will be paid in local currency.]The United Kingdom and French Delegations approved the United states proposal subject to reservation as to the drafting.5. All reasonable expenses incurred in Hungary in establishing claims,including the assessment of loss or damage, shall be borne by the hungarian government.6. United Nations nationals and their property shall be exempted fromany exceptional taxes, levies or imposts, imposed on their capital assets in Hungaryby the Hungarian Government, or any Hungarian authority between the date ofthe Armistice and the coming into force of the present Treaty for the specificjourpose of meeting charges arising out of the war or of meeting the costs of occupying forces or of reparations payable to any of the United Nations. any sums which have been so paid shall be refunded.7. The owner of the property concerned and the Hungarian Governmentmay agree upon arrangements in lieu of the provisions of this Article.8.   As used in this Article : (a) &quot; United Nations nationals &quot; means individuals who are nationals of anyof the United Nations or corporations or associations organised underthe laws of any of the United Nations at the date of the coming intoforce of the present Treaty, provided that they also had this statusat the date of the Armistice with Hungary.The term &quot;United Nations nationals&quot; also includes allindividuals, corporations or associations which under the laws in forcein Hungary during the war, have been treated as enemy.(&amp;) &quot; Owner &quot; means the United Nations national, as defined in sub-paragraph (a) above, who is entitled to the property in question, and includes a successor of the owner, provided that the successor is alsoa United Nations national as defined in sub-paragraph (a). If the successor has purchased the property in its damaged state, the trans-feror shall retain his rights to compensation under this Article,without prejudice to obligations between the transferor and the purchaser under domestic law.(c) &quot; Property &apos;&apos; means all movable and immovable property, whether tangibleor intangible, including industrial, literary and artistic property, aswell as all rights, estates or interests in property of any kind.9. French proposal supported by United Kingdom and United States subjectto drafting : &apos;[A new agreement shall be negotiated between the Danube-Sava-AdriaticaRailway Company, the Governments concerned, and the Committee of Bond-holders of the Company, in order to determine the method of applying theprovisions of the Rome&apos;Agreement of the 29th March, 1923, laying down theCompany&apos;s Articles of Association, and the modifications required to adapt themto the changes which have followed on the redistribution of the lines over the territories of various States. This Agreement shall contain all the provisionsnecessary to ensure satisfactory servicing of the bonds and payments of amounts in arrears.]The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics Delegation considers that there isno reason for the inclusion in the Peace Treaty of the French Delegation^proposal, because a Peace Treaty should not contain provisions dealing withparticular private Companies.
Hungary recognises that the Soviet Union is entitled to all German assets in hungary transferred to the Soviet Union by the Control Council for&apos; Germanyand undertakes to take all necessary measures for facilitating such transfers.Article 25.Union of Soviet Socialist Republics proposal: [The rights of the Hungarian Government and of Hungarian physical and.juridical persons with regard to Hungarian property and other Hungarian assetson the territory of Allied and Associated Powers, in so far as such rights were limited in consequence of the participation of Hungary in the war on the sideof Germany, shall be restored after the coming into force of the present Treaty.]United States, United Kingdom and French proposal : 1[1.

The Hungarian Government undertakes to compensate Hungariannationals whose property is taken under this Article and not returned to them.4. No obligation is created by this Article on any Allied or AssociatedPower to return industrial, literary or artistic property to the Hungarian Govern-ment or Hungarian nationals, or to include such property in determining theamounts which may be retained under paragraph 1 of this Article. TheGovernment of each of the Allied and Associated Powers shall have the rightto impose such limitations, conditions and restrictions on rights or interests withrespect to industrial, literary and artistic property acquired prior to the cominginto force of this Treaty in the territory of that Allied or Associated power by the Government or nationals of Hungary, as may be deemed by the Governmentof the Allied or Associated Power to be necessary in the national interest.5. The property covered by paragraph 1 of this Article shall be deemedto include Hungarian property which has been subject to control by reason ofa state of war existing between Hungary and the Allied or Associated Powerhaving jurisdiction over the property, but shall not include :  (a) Property of the Hungarian Government used for consular or diplomaticpurposes.(b) Property belonging to religious bodies or private charitable institutions and used for religious or charitable purposes.(c) Property of natural persons who are Hungarian nationals permitted to reside within the territory of the country in which the property islocated or to reside elsewhere in United Nations&apos; territory, other thanHungarian property which at any time during the war was subjected to measures not generally applicable to the property of Hungariannationals resident in the same territory.(d) Property rights arising since the resumption of trade and financial relations between Hungary and the Allied and Associated Powers,or arising out of transactions between Hungary and the Governmentsof any Allied or Associated Power since the 6th September, 1944.]Article 26.Union of Soviet Socialist Republics proposal: [1.

This renunciation shallbe without prejudice to any dispositions in favour of Hungary or Hungariannationals made by the Powers responsible forthe occupation of Germany.]Article 27.1.
