Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1946.SECRET. Copy No.   38CP. (46) 297.25th July, 1946.CABINET.LOCATION OF POWER STATIONS.Memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power.A serious difficulty has arisen in connection with the strategic aspect of the location of Power Stations.2. The Air Ministry are objecting to the construction of a Power station at Poplar, and as I regard the provision of this additional plant as urgently necessary, I am asking my colleagues to authorise me to go ahead with the project.3. For some time the -practice of consultation with the Air Ministry onthe site of Power Stations has been in force. In view of the considerable post-war programme the Civil Defence Committee of the Cabinet in April 1944,under the Chairmanship of the then Minister of Home Security, consideredthe policy to be adopted for the post-war programme of power station con-struction. The Civil Defence Committee gave general approval that in theordinary course of events no objection should be raised to establishing orextending a Generating Station up to 300,000 kilowatts. They asked, however,that the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security should be consulted in all cases above 150,000 kilowatts. Secondly, they agreed that a decision onthe question of whether air raid protection should be provided for new plantshould be deferred.4. Since April 1944 the Electricity Commissioners have been working tothis arrangement.5. On the 3rd February, 1945, a directive was issued by the late PrimeMinister setting out &quot; four propositions which may, for the time being, beaccepted as defining the bearing of strategic considerations upon problems ofindustrial location &quot; (Annex to D.I. (45) 3). That directive will, I understand,be reviewed by the Home Defence Committee, especially in the light of the atomicbomb, and they will thereafter issue to Departments guidance on the questionof strategic consideration in the location of Industry.6. The current programme of the Central Electricity Board provides fora new station at Poplar. The first unit will be 100,000 kilowatts to be availablein 1949; ultimately it will be increased to 300,000 kilowatts. In accordance withthe decision of Ministers in April 1944, the Electricity Commissioners consulted the Air Ministry who, in a letter of the 24th May, wrote as follows : &quot;I am directed to inform you that on strategic grounds the Air Ministry must registerstrong objection to such a further addition to the concentration of power stations on Thamesside, and particularly in an area which proved so vulnerableduring the war to bombing, flying bombs and long-range rockets. I am, there-fore, to suggest that every effort should be made to find alternative location forthe source or sources of additional power required to meet the growth of loadin South-East England.&quot;7. The reason for building the new station at Poplar is briefly this.Demand in the North-Eastern Section of London is rapidly rising. Hightension cables will be run from Poplar to Islington and ultimately to the[32189]
Northmet Station at Brimsdown. This is part of a programme of developmentof supplies for the Greater London area, which is seriously short of power and,whenever possible, the new stations are placed on the waterside. To do so solvesthe two problems of obtaining water-borne coal and of obtaining the necessarywater for the boilers. It is perhaps not generally appreciated that for everyton of coal burnt in the boilers of a Power Station 600 tons of water is required.A station not on a river requires gigantic cooling towers, which are expensiveto construct and which require much land.. Technically, I am advised a stationwith cooling towers is not so efficient as with a circulating system.8. The Central Electricity Board and the Electricity Commissioners, after examining all possible alternatives, have come to the conclusion that one of thenew Stations for the London area should be erected at Poplar on the site of anold graving dock near the East India Docks. The Air Ministry&apos;s objection toPoplar is based on the fact that within a mile of the proposed sight there aretwenty-eight key points, and it is, therefore, likely to attract heavy bombing.They suggested as an alternative that the Station might be moved further down the Thames somewhere East of Dagenham.9. My reason for pressing for an immediate decision to authorise theStation is the acute shortage of electricity generating plant. That shortage will persist till 1950. - The Central Electricity Board, as a result of a thoroughanalysis, estimate that in the country as a whole the shortages of plant will be : Kw.Winter of 1946-47 ............      1,400,000Winter of 1947-^L8 ............      1,540,000Winter of 1948-49 .............      1,700,000Winter of 1949-50............      1,000,000For South-East England, of which, of course, Greater London is the predominantpart, the corresponding shortages will be : &apos;Kw.Winter of 1946-47 ............ 350,000Winter of 1947-48 ............. 504,000Winter of 1948-49 ............ 560,000Winter of 1949-50 ...      ......... 303,000If the construction programmes go as planned it is hoped to arrive at a balanceof capacity and demand by 1950-51.10. This shortage of plant persisting for years after the end of the warwill have serious repercussions on housing, industrial and transport develop-ment. There are certain to be widespread failures of supply at any time duringthe next four winters, when the weather becomes critical.11. The Air Ministry objection raises sharply the whole question of the relation of strategic considerations to the location of power stations, but I would prefer to discuss that important general issue when the new Conclusions of theHome Defence Committee become available. Meanwhile, I would ask mycolleagues to authorise me to go ahead with the construction of the Power Stationsrequired to put us right in plant capacity, i.e., all the stations planned to beoperation by 1950. On most of the stations, the strategic considerations havebeen satisfactorily agreed between Ministries; but over and above the case ofPoplar, there are the four stations described in the Annex the strategic aspect of which have not yet been considered. Only by pressing on with this current programme as a matter of vital urgency can we hope to have the necessary powersupplies which are fundamental to all forms of development.12. If the Air Ministry&apos;s objection to Poplar is accepted, then a suitablesite is lost and a search must begin for a new site. The Air Ministry&apos;s suggestion of going East of Dagenham does not mean they know of a site in that locality;it really means that they would not object to a site East of Dagenham.Even if a new site could be found, a year or 18 months would be lost in pre-liminaries already carried out at Poplar. The alternative site could never be as suitable as Poplar. It would certainly require wharfage, road and rail facilities; it would require a housing estate in its proximity; and con-connections between it and Poplar would cost  150,000 a mile. Even if a site couldbe found a Station on it might well cost  2 to  3 million more all representinglabour and materials which are In short supply. And, finally, the Stations couldnot be of any help to us in the critical next four years.
13. The electricity supply industry will, I hope, be nationalised in 1947. Ifshortages of plant persist for years after nationalisation the effects politicallywill be serious. The public will find it hard to understand that a Power Stationtakes 3 years to construct.14.   I would propose therefore that:(i) the Committee should authorise the construction of Poplar and the fourstations listed in the Annex, required to be in operation by 1950regardless of strategic considerations;(ii) that when the Home Defence Committee have issued their conclusions on strategic considerations as affecting industrial location, a Committeeshould be appointed to consider how far they are applicable to power stations to be brought into operation after 1950.E. S.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S. W. 1,25th July, 1946.ANNEX.1. Carrington, Manchester.-A. new Station with an ultimate capacity of300,000 kilowatts.2. Southwick, Brighton. Extension of the Station from 150,000 to200,000 kilowatts.3. Clyde&apos;&apos;s Mill, Nr. Cambusland, Glasgow. Extension of the station by60,000 kilowatts.4. Bankside Station of the City of London Company. This very old station is to be reconstructed with an ultimate capacity of 200,000 kilowatts.
