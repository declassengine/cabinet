Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 290.22nd July, 1946.CABINET.WORLD FEDERATION OF DEMOCRATIC YOUTH.Memorandum by the Minister of State.THIS body is seeking inclusion on the panel of non-Governmental organisa-tions which are to be accorded the official status of consultants to the Economicand Social Council of the United Nations Organisation. The question arisesof the attitude which the United Kingdom Representative on the special Sub-Committee of the Economic and Social Council should take when the applicationof the Federation comes up. I feel bound to consult my colleagues as the matter has rather wide implications, both intrinsically and from the point of view ofinternal politics in this country, and has already been before the Cabinet(CM. (45) 19th Conclusions).2. I annex a brief summary of the history of the Federation. It will beseen that the Federation has every appearance of a creation of the Soviet Govern-ment for their own political purposes. In fact, it seems to be a clear example of the increasing tendency of the Soviet Government to create, or penetrate, inter-nationai bodies of an apparently harmless character for the purpose of spreadingCommunist ideas and propaganda. In practice, that means that they are usedfor propaganda against Great Britain. In this case, the target is the well-chosenone of youth, to whose conversion the Communists always devote particular attention.3. I should welcome the view of my colleagues. The provisional conclu-sions at which I have myself arrived are as follows : (i) The &apos;&apos; World Federation of Democratic Youth &apos;&apos; is now clearly underCommunist control, and has no valid claim to be representative of youthoutside the Soviet Union and possibly some of its satellites,(ii) It nevertheless claims to speak on all matters as the body representingworld youth, and the views of the United Kingdom representativesare put forward and publicised abroad as the views of British youth asa whole.(iii) There is no evidence that the Federation has any genuine programme for meeting the needs of young people.(iv) On the other hand there is evidence that the purpose of the dominatingSoviet bloc in the Federation is to destroy existing non-political youth organisations.(v) The Federation cannot therefore possibly be accepted by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment as a proper body to represent world youth.(vi) The United Kingdom Representative on the Economic and Social council should be instructed to oppose the application of the Federation on theground that it is not representative of world youth and that its title and claims are unfounded.(vii) In opposing the application of the Federation at the Economic and social Council, the United Kingdom Representative should take theline that the recognition of any existing body as capable of speakingfor the youth of the world is in any case premature, and that anessential preliminary is the formation of representative national bodies in the various States, which can then combine to form a genuinelyrepresentative international organisation with authority to speak forthe youth movements of the world.13450   [32176]
(viii) On account of the undesirable activities of the World Federation of democratic Youth, the leading youth organisations in the UnitedKingdom should be encouraged in their present efforts to set up theirown representative national organisation.P. J. N.-B.22nd July, 1946.ANNEX.History of &quot; The World Federation of Democratic Youth.&quot;IN 1941 an &quot; International Youth Council &quot; was formed in London amongstwar refugees. The woman secretary of this Council was Betty Shields-Collins,a member of the Communist Party and a tireless worker for Anglo-Soviet youth organisations in the Communist interest. In November 1942 this group set upthe &quot;World Youth Council.&quot;2. In the spring of 1945 the &quot;World Youth Council&quot; informed theForeign Office that it was hoping to call a conference in August and requestedfacilities for visiting delegates. The secretary of the &quot; World Youth Council &quot;was Mrs. Kutty Hookham, a member of the Communist Party, and the chiefBritish delegate was Margot Gale, who was regarded by the party leaders as one of their best &quot;undercover&quot; contacts. This request was originally turneddown on the strength of a War Cabinet decision of June 1942 (stipulating that,if an organisation was controlled or materially influenced or directed by apolitical party, visas would not be granted to delegates to attend from abroad).However, in August 1945 the Cabinet reversed the decision, and the &quot;WorldYouth Conference &quot; was held in London in November 1945 and established the&quot; World Federation of Democratic Youth.&quot;3. When it became known that the conference was going to be held, andthat facilities would be granted by His Majesty&apos;s Government, a protest was atonce delivered at the Foreign Office by a deputation from the Standing Confer-ence of National Youth Organisations, on the grounds that the World YouthCouncil was not representative of youth organisations either in this country oranywhere else, and that it was not clear on what authority the conference hadbeen called. The eighteen youth organisations composing the StandingConference, including the Scouts, Guides, Y.M.C.A. and Y.W.C.A., thereforetook no part in the World Youth Conference and the British members at theConference were consequently largely unrepresentative of British youthmovements.4. When the delegations from other countries arrived, the true nature and purpose of the conference became evident. The Russian delegation, whose averageage was forty, and which was led by a major-general, arrived some time beforethe conference opened in order to prepare the agenda. In an article in theSoviet Youth newspaper the President of the &apos;&apos; Anti-Fascist Committee of SovietYouth,&quot; Fedorov, who was one of the delegates at the conference, indicated thatthe Russian aim was to achieve a break with all existing youth movements, andto bring about the destruction of all but &quot; anti-Fascist national youth move-men ts,&quot; which would be united under international control. Efforts by &quot; some members of the Scouts, Catholic and certain other unions &quot; to organise them-selves were described as a &quot; provocative attempt . . . bitterly resented by the progressive youth of the world.&quot; This programme was exactly in line with acontemporary speech by President Kalinin to the Soviet youth organisationKomsomol.5. As regards other countries, warnings or protests were received con-cerning the delegations from Greece, Roumania, Bulgaria, Austria and Tunis,either alleging that only Communist youth movements had been invited to senddelegates, or that only Communists had been permitted by their governments to attend.6. During the conference, the Soviet delegation, numbering about sixty,were driven to the meetings in buses, driven away for lunch by themselves, andallowed to accept invitations only in groups of four or more. They were liberallyprovided with funds and they entertained lavishly. They had been given specialcourses of instruction, and included political specialists who briefed representa-tives before each debate. Delegations from the Russian- Satellite States weresimilarly organised.
7. The delegations from the Western European States were untrained,unbrief ed and quite unable to stand up to the Communists, particularly as the systemof proposing and voting for resolutions, which had been arranged beforehand,was never explained.8. After its creation in London the Federation established its headquarters at Paris, where it has been active in issuing manifestos, canvassing to induce other organisations to affiliate with it, and generally seeking to extend its influence.The Federation is largely Communist-controlled. Of its Executive Committee,the Chairman, one of the Vice-Chairmen, all three Secretaries and four othermembers are either Communist Party members or very strong Communistsympathisers, a proportion of nine out of a total of seventeen. Margot Galeherself is a member of the Audit Committee. A British Committee of theorganisation was recently established in London as a result of a local conference.Two out of six of the Executive Committee elected are members of the CommunistParty.9. Meanwhile, existing bodies representative of British youth are, with theassistance of the National Council of Social Service, engaged in establishing theirown central organisation, to be called the &quot; 18-30 Conference of NationalVoluntary Youth Organisations.&quot; This organisation will certainly refuse toaffiliate with the &quot; World Federation of Democratic Youth,&quot; just as the parallelFrench Organisations has already refused to affiliate with the Federation despitestrong pressure.
