CONFIDENTIALUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 44COPY NO18 July 1980 &apos;hiA)&apos;CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1981-82 -LOCAL AUTHORITIESMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. I was invited to discuss with Ministers the proposals in Annex A ofC(80) 40, and as a first priority the totals for local authority currentexpenditure in 1981-82, in time for discussion in Cabinet on 24 July(CC(80) 28th Conclusions, Minute 2).    This was to be within our agreedaim of keeping to the net public expenditure totals for 1981-82 to 1983-84published in Cmnd 7841, as reduced by the European Community Settlement.2. This paj er is limited to the decisions we need to reach now on localauthority current and capital spending in -981-82.    My main proposal is thatthe local authorities be informed immediately that their total current expendi-ture in 1981-82 should be 2 per cent below the Government&apos;s planned figurefor 1980-81.    The main issue for decision now is the  60 million reductionin education in England in 1981-82 which I propose, in addition to the  20- 25 million reduction which the Secretary of State for Education and Scienceis willing to find (see paragraph 7 ii below).A.    LOCAL AUTHORITY CURRENT EXPENDITURE (ENGLAND AND WALES)3. We have to decide how to handle the total of local authority currentexpenditure and its relationship to individual services, and to settle thereduction in education.4. It is the local authorities  themselves who ultimately decide on theallocation of spending among the various services.   Hence we need to decideon the planned total of local authority current expenditure for 1981-82, as thekey indicator which we should give to the authorities in the next week or so.5. On the other hand, for some services (law and order, education) mycolleagues will wish to tell the authorities at some stage what the Governmentintends that they should spend.    The allocation of the planned total among thevarious services has to be settled among Ministers by mid-September, so thatwe can assess the distributional effects of alternative Rate Support Grant(RSG) percentages.    These totals for individual services will need to bepublished at latest in the next White Paper, and will be taken as an importantindication of the Government&apos;s priorities.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL6. Hence we should aim to decide both the aggregate totals and theservice totals, even though the latter can only be provisional.   For theaggregate, we gave a broad indication in the White Paper earlier this yearthat the 1981-82 figure for Great Britain should be 2 per cent below theplanned total for 1980-81*   We are still engaged in trying to secure thisplanned figure for the current year, and have called for revised budgetsconsistent with it.    I propose that we should now tell local authorities that thetotal for their relevant current expenditure in 1981-82, in England and Walesshould be 2 per cent below the Government&apos;s planned figure for 1980-81; thisindication is being given in advance of the RSG settlement in the autumn, toassist with their planning for next year.    If Cabinet agrees, I will settle thedetails of this announcement with the Secretaries of State for the Environment)and Wales, and other colleagues concerned,7. Service totals should be consistent with this aggregate.    In general,we should aim to keep to the service totals already planned for next year(see Annex 2), but this gives rise to problems in two areas:-i.       LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES (ENGLAND)The survey provision for this item looks likely to be overspentby some  80 million next year.   The prospect could change(revised 1980-81 budgets, effect of block grant on distribution nextyear).    The Secretary of State for the Environment proposes that weshould not seek to offset this provisional overspending at present, butshould if necessary scale down all the local authority service totalspro rata, from the revised local authority budget figures, to avoidexceeding our planned aggregate.    This would probably entail a largefurther reduction in the total for education (see below), which I do notthink my colleagues would find easy to accept.    It would also suggestto the local authorities that the Government shared their own apparentpriority for current spending on local environmental services.Hence I&apos;propose that we, maintain the survey totals for individualservices, with only the minoz changes shown in column 4 of Annex 1,but recognise that these may need to be looked at again in September inthe light of the revised budgets.EDUCATION (ENGLAND)Here there is a disagreement which I must ask my colleagues toresolve.I proposed a reduction of   50 million net, equivalent to 87 million gross allowing for the  37 million excess assumed fromthe loss of savings on school transport.    Towards this  87 million,the Secretary of State for Education and Science would be willing to find 20- 25 million, from various places within his programme; notablyhigher education.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Secretary of State argues that he cannot go beyond this 20- 25 million without modifying The Queen&apos;s Speech statementthat &quot;the quality of education will be maintained and improved&quot;.I propose that we do modify It along the lines that, whilepublic expenditure is being cut back, resources should be concentratedon the &quot;basic skills&quot; (as in the Manifesto) leaving less for other aspectsof educational &quot;quality&quot;.In that case the full saving of  87 million next year could inmy view be achieved, by seeking the balance from economies inschools.    (There would be consequential reductions in Scotland andWales.)   I recommend that we should se decide.8. A small agreed adjustment to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheriesand Food figure for arterial drainage is included in Annex 1; it also affectscapital expenditure in Annex 2.    The increase of  13 million in civil defenceexpenditure agreed by Cabinet might make a small difference to the total anddistribution of local authority current expenditure.B. LOCAL AUTHORITY CAPITAL (ENGLAND AND WALES)9. In general I propose that we confirm the survey totals for 1981-82,as shown in Annex 2.    The only programmes needing separate comment arehousing (see below), trade and education:-i.       TRADE (LOCAL AIRPORTS) (ENGLAND)I have agreed a small inciease in local airports capitalexpenditure ( 3$ million, partially offset by a reduction of 1 million in central government expenditure).    I shall reportorally to Cabinet on the outcome of discussion of a further bidfor the same programmes.ii.       EDUCATION (ENGLAND)The Secretary of State for Education and Science may wish totake on ca &gt;ital a small proportion of the cuts finally agreed (asabove), bi.t in any case probably not more than  5 million.C. HOUSING (ENGLAND AND WALES)10. I proposed a reduction of  65 million in the provision for housing(England) next year.    The Secretary of State for the Environment has not yetdecided on the split between current and capital spending in this programme fornext year, but is prepared to find this further saving from within hisprogrammes, though not necessarily from housing alone.    This is acceptableto me.   For the purposes of this paper I am assuming that the whole reductionwould fall on either housing or non-local authority (other environmental)services: it would have the usual consequentials for Scotland and Wales,3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALD. SCOTLAND11. I have reached agreement with the Secretary of State for Scotland aboutlocal authority current expenditure in 1981-82*   He will announce that it willbe reduced by 2 per cent by comparison with the planned level for thisexpenditure in 1980-81 - the same percentage as for England and Wales. Thisreduction is xather higher than that implied in the baseline plans.12. I si.all be having further discussions with the Secretary of State aboutreductions in 1981-82 in the other areas of Scottish expenditure, and about1982-83 and 1983-84,    I shall report back to Cabinet in due course.CONCLUSION13. I invite Cabinet to agree that:-i.      the Secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland andWales should tell the local authorities that in the Government&apos;s viewthe total of their current expenditure relevant for RSG purposes for1981-82 should be 2 per cent less than the corresponding planned totalfor the current year; I should settle the details of these announcementswith the Secretaries of State and other Ministers concerned;ii.       for the purpose of calculating the RSG distribution in Englandand Wales the total3 for individual local authority services for 1981-82should, except for education, be a&amp; in the survey (see Annex 1,column 4), subject to further consideration in September;iii. the total for the education programme in 1981-82 in Englandshould be reduced by  50 million, on die basis that while publicexpenditure is being cut back resources should be concentrated on thebasic educational skills at the expense of some other aspects ofeducational &quot;quality&quot;;iv. the survey totals for local authority capital expenditure in1981-82 in England and Wales should be confirmed, with minoradjustments, as in Annex 2;v.      the offer by the Secretary of State for the Environment to finda saving of  65 million from his programmes in 1981-82 should beaccepted.14. I shall continue bilateral discussions on other programmes and thelater years with the Ministers concerned, and report back to Cabinet in duecourse.W J BTreasury Chambers18 July 19804CONFIDENTIAL
