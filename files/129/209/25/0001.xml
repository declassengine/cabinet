CONFIDENTIALS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 50 COPY NO 3629 July 1980CABINETPAY, PENSIONS AND ALLOWANCES OF MEMBERS OFPARLIAMENTNote by the Secretary of the CabinetI attach a note by officials prepared in accordance with my instructions fromCabinet last week to arrange for officials to examine and report on thefinancial implications of the Motion on Parliamentary Pay, Pensions andAllowances passed by the House on 21 July (CC(80) 30th Conclusions,Minute 2).Signed ROBERT ARMSTRONGCabinet Office29 July 1980
CONFIDENTIALPAY, PENSIONS AND ALLOWANCES OF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENTNote by OfficialsINTRODUCTION1. On 21 July the House of Commons amended the Government&apos;s motion on thepay and allowances of Members of Parliament in 4 significant ways: byproviding that MP&apos;s pensions should be based on the rates of pay recommendedby the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) as appropriate from 13 June 1980;by providing that the rate of accrual of MP&apos;s pensions should be l/40thof pensionable pay for each year of service;   by providing that MP&apos;s payshould &quot;correspond with .... the salary paid to a specified grade in thepublic service&quot;;   and by providing that the secretarial allowance availableto MPs should be raised to 8,000 a year from 13 June 1980.    (The text of themotion as amended is at Annex A.)     The Cabinet in its preliminary discussionof these proposals on 24 July (CC(80) 30th Conclusions - Minute 2) asked tobe provided with further factual information before coming to a decision.This note fulfils that remit.     It has been prepared by officials of theTreasury, the Civil Service Department (CSD), the Inland Revenue and theGovernment Actuary&apos;s Department under Cabinet Office Chairmanship.THE SALARY BASE FOR MP&apos;S PENSIONS2. The current salary of MPs is  11,750 a year (the new rate for 1980-81just accepted by the House).     The Government had proposed that pensions in1980-81 should be based on a notional salary of  13,150.     The amended motionraises this notional salary to  13,750.     If present conventions were followedMPs would pay their 6 per cent pension contributions on the full notionalsalary of  13,750, but would be credited with the difference between thecontribution on actual salary of  11,750 and notional salary of  13,750(ie  120 a year).     As the Government motion before amendment offered suchreimbursement on the extra contribution required for a notional salary of 13,150, ( 84 a year), the area for manoeuvre is the extra contribution( 36 a year) on the higher notional salary of  13&gt;750.     In addition theExchequer also contributes to the Parliamentary Pension Fund its 16 per centshare of the difference between notional and real salary.     The relevantcontribution on the extra  600 of notional salary would be  96 per Member,giving a total Exchequer   cost of about  132 per Member or some  80,000 in all.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3. Ministers wanted to consider the possibility of making MP&apos;s pay for theadditional concession on notional pay.     We are advised that it would beultra vires to make MP&apos;s pay the Exchequer contribution, as employer, tothe cost of the additional notional salary.     The question therefore issimply whether MP&apos;s might be asked to pay an extra  36 a head in 1980-81.Whether further extra payments would be needed in future years would dependon whether notional pay remained ahead of actual pay.     Although the sum issmall, MP&apos;s would be likely to resist such a proposal - and their acquiescenceon a free vote is necessary.     They would be likely to point to precedent(their notional salary has been ahead of actual salary since 1975 and theExchequer has borne the whole cost of the additional cover);   and to thefact that - as they will see it - the TSRB recommended rate of pay istheirs by right and that, by accepting staging, they are in effect alreadymaking an extra contribution of  2000 a head to the Exchequer in 1980-81.4. In considering these matters Ministers will also wish to bear in mindthat, because of the bunching of MP&apos;s retirements (voluntary or force d) atthe dates of general elections, the real concern of MP&apos;s is with the sizeof their salaries (real or notional) in the twelve months preceding eachelection.     MP&apos;s will be concerned therefore to preserve the concept ofnotional pay if they think this will give a higher pension entitlement thanactual pay constrained by monetary targets, and to minimise their contributionsin the interim.     Assuming that the next election will occur in 1983 or 1984,the critical years from the point of view of MP&apos;s pensions will be 1981-82and 1982-83.     Whether there will be a difference between notional and actualpay in these years depends on the decision the Government will have to takenext spring when the next TSRB report on MP&apos;s pay will be available, and onthe decisions on linkage (and especially the salary base from which linkageapplies) which will have been made before then.5. It is obviously impossible to forecast what recommendations the TSRB mightmake next year.     But if they were simply to add 9 per cent to their currentassessment of the appropriate salary of  13&gt;750, MP&apos;s pay would rise to  15,000(an increase of 27 per cent over current rates).     It must be regarded aslikely therefore that the question of establishing a notional rate of pay forpension purposes for MP&apos;s higher than the rates actually in payment willcontinue for some years.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL6. In addition to the direct costs of the concession on notional pay forwhich MPs have voted, there is also likely to. be an indirect cost. Asmany members of the Cabinet recognised last week, a concession to MPscarries a strong moral obligation to make a similar concession to the otherTSRB groups affected by the decisions to reduce pay below the TSRB recommendedrates as well as for the senior PRU grades (Assistant Secretaries, etc) towhom arbitration was refused.     About 8000 public servants had their pensionentitlements reduced by these decisions.     In the normal course of eventsover 1000 of these can be expected to retire or die before 1 April 1982(the period during which decisions on notional pay in 1980-81 affect theirpensions).     This would cost about  l^m   a year in 1980-81 and 1981-82, 600,000 in 1982-83 with a diminishing commitment thereafter.     These figuresassume in the case of Assistant Secretaries, Senior Principals and analogousgrades that the relevant level of &quot;notional&quot; pay would be the rates offeredby the CSD earlier this year before the decision was taken to refusearbitration.     The way in which this procedure would work is describedin Annex B.THE RATE OF PENSION ACCRUAL7. The pension arrangements governing pensions throughout the public servicesvary from group to group (the main features of the existing schemes aredescribed in Annex C.)     The most important of the public service pensionschemes   in terms of numbers of beneficiaries - are those   relating to theCivil Service (700,000 employees), the National Health Service (700,000employees) and local government including teachers (1,800,000 employees).These schemes are to all intents and purposes identical.     Each is based onthe accumulation of pension rights at the rate of l/80th of final salary for .each year of service with a maximum pension of half final salary. Inaddition each provides for a lump sum to be paid on retirement accumulatedat the rate of j/&amp;0th of final salary for each year of service. Actuariallythere is little difference in benefit between these schemes and the MP&apos;spension scheme.     The lump sum for civil servants, nurses, etc equates broadlyto the extra maximum pension of 16  per cent of final pay which MPs areallowed to earn.     And MPs have the right to commute a part of their pensionto a lump sum.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL8. The amendment proposes that MP&apos;s pensions should accrue at a rateof l/40th of salary&quot; per year of service, compared to the existing rate ofl/60.     This would not alter the maximum pension (of     final salary) butwould determine how quickly that maximum was reached.     A full pension wouldbe earned after 26f years service - and any longer service, either in theHouse, or outside it, (since pension rights can be transferred into and outof the Parliamentary scheme) would not add to pension entitlement.9. Although MP&apos;s pensions are governed by a statutory scheme, and thusstrictly outside Revenue &apos;approval1, they have always been operated as ifthe Revenue limits applied ie subject to a maximum pension entitlement oftwo-thirds of final salary and employee^ contributions limited to 15 per centof salary.     Under these rules a scheme providing for employee contributionsin excess of 15 per cent is not approved and hence loses all entitlement totax relief.10. The terms of the amended resolution appear to require that all yearsof service by MPs, past as well as future, shall qualify for pension atthe rate of l/40th of final salary.     If, as the Cabinet envisaged, thewhole cost of the improvement were to be met by increases in the contributionsof MPs from current salary, the rate of contribution initially would on averagehave to be about 33 per cent.     If the Revenue rules were applied - and theydo not have to apply to a statutory scheme   none of this contribution wouldattract tax relief.     It can be assumed that an arrangement of this kindwould not be acceptable to MPs.11. An alternative arrangement might be to provide that only future servicequalified for accrual of pension by l/&apos;40ths.     But even here, and againassuming that the whole cost is borne by the Member concerned, the contributiowould be likely to exceed the 15 per cent limit even before allowing for anyadditional contributions which may be recommended by the Scott Committeeas a valuation for the &quot;certainty&quot; of index-linked pensions.     The sameconsideration would be likely to rule out allowing MPs to choose betweenremaining with the present l/60th scheme, and paying extra for a l/40thscheme for future service.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL12. The barriers to any variant of the l/40 scheme described above wouldof course disappear if the additional cost were borne by the Exchequer notby the individual MP.     The Exchequer already contribute 16 per cent ofsalary (of which 7 per cent is a deficiency payment to cover the backservice credit granted in 1965 and 1978 as against the member&apos;s 6 per cent.But if the Exchequer met the cost of this further concession (an immediatedirect cost of  1.4m a year) widespread pressure could be expected fromall other public service employees for equivalent treatment and this couldbe very expensive, hf For example the average Civil Service pensioner hasonly 27 years of  qualifying service for pension so that actual Civil Servicepensions    average one-third rather than one half of final salary. Accrualat the rate of l/53 f r each year of service (the equivalent of l/40th forMP&apos;s) would increase the average size of public service pensions by abouta half - at an ultimate cost, assuming no retrospection, possibly in excessof  1 billion a year at 1980 values.13. Faced with these arguments MPs will assert that the particular conditionsof their employment mean that they cannot build up an equivalent pension toother public servants.   They will point to the fact that the average lifein the House of an MP is around 20 years rather than the 40 needed to acquirea full pension.   This argument ignores the fact that MPs can for the most partearn pensions in other employment many of which will be transferable into theParliamentary scheme.   They will also argue that police, firemen and membersof the armed forces can accrue pensions at a faster rate than they can (30years for full pension in the case of a policeman).   But very special considerationsapply to these pensions - ie the physical demands of the job and hence theobligation to retire early   which do not apply to MPs.14. But the real argument against a change in the rate of accrual of MP&apos;spensions, however brought about, is that it is unnecessary.   The arrangementswhich already exist for the purchase of added years, by periodic contributions,and the arrangements which existed from January 1979 to January 1980 for thepurchase of added years by lump sum, enable MPs, within limits, to determinetheir own rate of accrual of pension rights.   There will of course be individualcases where the Revenue rules, and the length of service by the MP, will resultin a pension well below the maximum entitlement.   But most MPs disadvantaged in5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthis way will have pension rights acquired outside Parliament.   In any caseit is unnecessary to change the structure of the scheme to cater for hardcases.   But if a concession would be helpful, the easiest, and perhaps themost practicable, would be to revive the arrangements applicable last yearfor the purchase of added years by lump sum, which operated up to Januarythis year.   No other alternative seems viable unless the Exchequer contributionwere increased significantly above its present level.LINKAGE15    If the pay of MPs is to be linked to some external indicator thatindicator needs to be chosen.   The options (considered more fully in Annex D) aia. Linkage to an index.   We assume that Ministers will not want topursue this option.b. Linkage to one or more comparators in the private sector. Apartfrom the difficulty in choosing the comparators a private sector linkcould well, in present circumstances, give a relatively high result.c. Linkage to a specific Civil Service grade: apart from the difficultyof choosing the most appropriate grade there would be a danger that ifthe Government chose a particular grade, eg Principal, the House ofCommons might substitute a more senior grade.   Control of MP&apos;s paycould thereby slip from Ministers&apos; grasp.d. Linkage to the rate of change in the pay of a single Civil Servicegrade or a group of grades: such a linkage - analogous to that alreadyoperated for setting the pay of prison officers   would avoid theseproblems but would require a decision to be taken on the appropriatestarting pay from which linking would operate.   The choices for startingpay are: the salary actually in payment ( 11,750) which would meanabandoning the third stage payment to MPs, due next year; the rate of 13,150 recommended by the Government as the appropriate third stagepayment in 1980-81; the TSRB recommended rate appropriate to 13 June 1980( 13 750)j or the rate determined next April by the TSRB as appropriate then6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSECRETARIAL ALLOWANCE16. The House of Commons also voted to increase their office, secretarialand research allowance to  7,859 for the year ending 31 March 1981 and  8,000for any subsequent year.   The extra annual cost of the amended motion wouldbe approximately  400,000 in total.   In earlier discussion the Cabinetappeared ready to accept this change.PROCEDURE17. Ministers may find it helpful to be reminded of the procedural stepsnecessary to give effect to any or all of the points covered by the CommonsMotions of 21 July.18. The Motions passed by the House were advisory.   The Motion dealing with pay,including the rate of pay for pensions purposes, needs to be followed by asubstantive Motion carrying the Queen&apos;s Recommendation.   This would dealwith the actual salary to be paid from 13 June 1980 ( 11,750) and from13 June 1981 ( 13,150).   It would also make provision for the notional rateof pay ( 13,750) for pensions purposes on and after lj June 1980 and for thecrediting to MPs of a sum to offset the cost to them of paying their 6 per centpensions contribution and the difference between their actual and notionalsalary for pensions purposes.   Such a Motion cannot be passed if amendedfrom the form proposed by the Government.   If amendments are carried theQueen&apos;s Recommendation needs to be sought again.   No further decision isneeded to deal with &quot;linkage&quot; which is simply an administrative means atarriving at recommendations to be put to the House in future, nor is afurther Motion needed to give effect to the increase in Secretarial allowancefor which the House voted.   Provision for a revised accrual rate for MPspensions would have to be sought in specific legislation.19     It so happens that the form of the Motion passed on July 21 was defective inrespect of the reinbursement to MPs of their pension contributions on notionalsalary.   Although the House amended the notional salary figure from  13,150 to 13&gt;750 they omitted to increase the relative offsetting credit from  84 to  120.It would be normal for the Government to put right such technical points inpresenting a substantive Motion carrying the Queen&apos;s Recommendation.&apos;   But ifMinisters were to decide that Members should be asked to bear the cost of theirpensions contribution on the extra  600 on notional salary they voted forthemselves it would be possible, though no doubt highly unpopular, to tellthem that as regards notional pay and reimbursement they were being givenprecisely what they asked for,CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCONCLUSIONS20.   If an announcement of the Government&apos;s reaction to the Motion passed bythe House of Commons on 21 July is to he presented before the recess, theCabinet needs to take the following decisions  a. Whether to attempt to face down the House of Commons and refuse toimplement any of the concessions which the House has set as the pricefor accepting a 9.6 per cent increase in salary this year;If this course is not acceptable! then  b. Whether to accept that the pension entitlement of Members of Parliamein the year from 13 June 1980 should be based on a notional pay of  13,75o. If so, whether to seek to recover from MPs the  36 reimbursement whichwould normally be made to them in respect of the  600 by which the notionasalary of  13,750 exceeds that of  13,150 which the Government has alreadyoffered.d. Whether to extend the concession on notional salary to the other TSKBgroups and to the PRU grades refused arbitration in respect of this year&apos;spay s e ttlement;e. Whether to stick to the proposition that any new improvement in theaccrual rate of MP&apos;s pensions should be wholly financed by the MPs concernin the knowledge that this condition severely limits what can be done,probably to a new arrangement for buying added years by lump sum.   If onthe other hand Ministers are prepared to see an increase in Exchequerfunding for improved accrual rates the precise nature of any scheme willneed to be considered further.f. Whether to accept that in future the rate of change in MP&apos;s pay shouldbe linked with that of a suitable &quot;basket&quot; of Civil Service rates of pay -supplemented if necessary by infrequent TSBB reviews (at the end or beginnof each Parliament), rather than to a single grade, an index or private seanalogues.8CONFIDENTIAL

[Mr, St. John-Stevas?
ANNEX BNOTIONAL PAY FOR OTHER TSRB AND SENIOR PRU GROUPSIf the Government decide to accept the views of the House onpensionable pay and agree as a consequence that the other TSEBgroups should be given a similar benefit, then the following actionwould need to be taken.   For all groups except Ministers the newlevel of pensionable pay would have to be promulgated as the properrate for the job with effect from 1 April 1980, superceding anypreviously promulgated rates.   This would only require appropriateletters and memoranda to be sent by officials but presumably theGovernment would wish to announce their decision in general termswhen the statement on MPs* pay and pensions^jr&amp;ade.   At the sametime it would need to be made clear that the Government could notcommit itself to implementing the new rates (except for pensionpurposes) by any particular date and the actual rates in paymentwould be those announced by the Prime Minister on 7 July. Forthe TSBB groups the pensionable salary would be the full TSBBrecommended rates.   For Assistant Secretaries and Senior Principalsthe pensionable salary would be the formal offer which CSD wouldhave made to the Unions had the Government not decided on a reduction( 22,000 and  18,000 for the respective maxima of the two grades)and it would be imposed by administrative action.To increase the pensionable pay of Ministers a new Order-in-Councilwould be required.   There would be timing problems in getting thisOrder through Parliament before the recess.
ANNEX CTHE PARLIAMENTARY PENSION SCHEME AND OTHER PUBLIC SERVICE SCHEMES1. All public service pension schemes, including the Parliamentary scheme, offerbroadly the same benefits.   The basic benefit is a maximum pension of 3 finalsalary, up to a quarter of which the scheme member may opt to commute to a lumpsum.   The maximum permissible commutation is to a lump sum of up to 1^- timesfinal salary, reducing the continuing pension to \ rather than -3- final salary.In the Civil Service, local government, NHS, armed forces and teachers9 schemes,full commutation is automatic;   in the Parliamentary and police and fire schemesit is optional.   The judicial scheme gives an automatic lump sum of twice theannual pension, the lower ratio reflecting the highly favourable accrual rate.2. The schemes are similar in other respects.   All offer a half-rate widows9pension (although the Parliamentary scheme is the only one to offer an automatichalf pension to dependent widowers) and smaller pensions to dependent children.Pension rights are fully transferable between all the schemes.   In most schemesthere is provision for purchasing added years of service, with the scheme memberbearing the full cost.   This was introduced for MPs by the Parliamentary Pensions(Purchase of Added Years) Order 1978, under which MPs may opt at any time to buyadded years by periodical payments (deductions from salary).   MPs may also opt,within 12 months of entering the House to purchase added years by a once-for-alllump sum payment;   the 1978 Order also gave this option to all serving Members,lapsing in January 1980.3. A further feature of the Parliamentary scheme is that when it was introducedin 1964, serving MPs were allowed to reckon service before that date, up to amaximum of 10 years.   This maximum was increased in 1978 to 15 years for MPsstill serving at that time.   The cost of this concession is being met by theExchequer through annual deficiency payments into the Fund.4. In most schemes, including the Parliamentary scheme, the full pensionaccrues over 40 years. Certain schemes offer more rapid accrual. Prisonofficers, policemen, firemen and the armed forces normally have to retireearlier than other groups, because of the requirement for physical fitness, andthe fast accrual rate reflects this. The very rapid accrual rate for thejudiciary is largely historical, going back to the 1920s and beyond: it3original purpose was to compensate judges for the inability to earn any pensionin their previous employment at the Bar.5. The table on the next page summarises the accrual rates for the main publicservice schemes, and the contributions paid by the employee.

ANNFX DLINKAGEThe House of Commons have voted in favour of MPs&apos; pay being&quot;regulated to correspond with the amounts; of the salary paid toa specified grade in the Public Service&quot;./&apos;If the Government accepts the views of the House on linkage,there will be no need to reach immediate conclusions on thenature of the link.   The House could be told that the Govern-ment agreed to the principle of a link and would bring forwarddetailed proposals for the consideration of Members in duecourse.   However Ministers may wish to have the followingpoints in mind when making their decision in principle:Type of link;   The link could be a direct one, so that MPs1 paywould correspond exactly with the actual rate of pay of aparticular grade (or the average of the rates of severalgrades); or it could be indirect, so that MPs&apos; pay wouldincrease by the same percentage as the pay of the specifiedgrade or grades without necessarily being at the same level.The former option poses much more severe problems of findingsuitable analogues.   As it is generally accepted that the workof MPs is like that of no other group, any direct link would beopen to question.   With an indirect link the starting level forMPs&apos; pay would need to be fixed: the obvious choices are theupdated third stage (13,150), the rate of pensionable pay votedby the House ( 13&gt;750) if this is accepted by the Government, oran entirely new rate, perhaps based on a further report by theReview Body.Number of analogues: MPs pay could be linked with a single grade,as envisaged in the Commons amendment, a group of grades, or ageneral indicator such as the Department of Employment&apos;s NewEarnings Survey which the Review Body&apos;s thirteenth report feltwas the least objectionable, form of linkage.   A link with asingle grade would have serious disadvantages.   It might bedifficult to find a grade on which the House and the Governmentcould agree, and the sensitivity over Members&apos; pay would betransferred to the linked grade.   A link with a general indicatorwould smack of indexation.If the link were with a group of grades, the components of thegroup would need to be chosen carefully.   It would beadministratively simpler and less likely to produce freak resultsif all the grades were within the Civil Service but even a broadlink of this sort could be sensitive with, for example,&apos; the CivilService unions.Periodic Reviews: Even if MPs&apos; pay were linked, it would seemappropriate for it to be subject to an independent reviewperiodically, perhaps once every five years or at the beginningor end of each Parliament.   The review would need to considerwhether MPs pay was still at the right level after several yearsof linkage&apos; and perhaps also whether the nature of the link wassatisfactory.   The review could presumably be done by the TopSalaries Review Body.
