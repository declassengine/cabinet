CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTo oC(80) 26 COPY NO9 May 1980CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1980-81Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department1. The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation Committee haveconsidered the proposals for Bills which Ministers have put forward for nextSess5.on&apos;s legislative programme.    This memorandum seeks Cabinetagreement to the Committee&apos;s recommend&quot;.tions.2. My colleagues will be well aware of the difficulties we have beenexperiencing with this Session&apos;s programme.    We want to avoid similarproblems next Session.    More generally, we need to lighten the load oflegislation on Parliament which many of our supporters believe to beexcessive.    We need, therefore, to plan a programme of about 25 mainBills - excluding finance, consolidation and Scottish Grand Committee Bills,and Bills that are likely to be suitable for Second Reading Committee. Wehave the prospect of two more full Sessions during the course of thisParliament which should enable a place to be found for those Bills which havebeen put forward this time but which cannot be accommodated in nextSession&apos;s programme. \,3. The Committee have sought to construct a balanced programme,reflecting the Government&apos;s main objectives.    We have given priority tothose Bills which will help to secure reductions in public expenditure andmanpower, or which otherwise assist our economic policies.    This willclearly form a major theme of next Session&apos;s Queen&apos;s Speech.    At the sametime; we have tried to find room for some Bills which will forward our socialpolicies.   We have taken into account the proposed timetables for Bills,giving weight to those which seem likely to be ready for early introduction.We have attempted to balance the more controversial measures with otherswhich might expect a less troubled passage, particularly if they seemedappropriate for introduction first in the House of Lords.4. We recommend the inclusion in the legislative programme for nextSession of the Bills listed in Annex A.    They include 10 &quot;Essential&quot; Billswhich must be enacted during the Session, and 16 &quot;Programme&quot; Bills,including the Education (Scotland) Bill.    We also recommend a further1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfive Bills for inclusion in next Session&apos;s legislative programme, in theexpectation that they will be suitable for Second Reading Committeeprocedure in the House of Commons.5. In addition, we must provide for a number of &quot;Contingent&quot; Bills,some of which may well become Essential.    These are listed in Annex B.My colleagues will note particularly that legislation for new constitutionalarrangements in Northern Ireland is likely to be needed.    This would takeup a substantial amount of time on the floor of the House of Commons. Itmay also be necessary to introduce a Criminal Justice Bill to relieveconditions of overcrowding in the prisons and make changes in the lawrelating to young offenders.6. The Scottish Bills put forward for next Session, other than theEducation Bill, should be suitable for Scottish Grand Committee in theHouse of Commons.    They are listed in Annex C.    We recommend thatthe Secretary of State for Scotland, in consultation with the Lord Presidentof the Council and the Lord Advocate, should decide the programme of Billsto be secured through that procedure.7. There are five Bills which we have not included in the programme,but which could be introduced if Legislation Committee were satisfied at thetime that they stood a good chance of being acceptable for Second ReadingCommittee procedure in the House of Commons,    These are at Annex D.8. I am circulating separately a paper (C(80) 27) giving details of theBills shown in the Annexes.9. I must remind colleagues who have Bills in the programme that it isessential for policy clearance to be sought and drafting authority obtainedat the very earliest opportunity.    Parliamentary Counsel must be given areasonable time in which to draft Bills.    This did not always happen in thepresent Session.    If, for any reason, the timetables which colleaguesproposed for their Bills cannot be met, they should inform the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster at once, so that he can consider the effect on theprogramme.    It is particularly important that Bills that have been promisedfor the beginning of the Session should be ready in good time; and that asmany of these as possible are started in the House of Lords, so helping toeven out their burden over the Session.10. I invite my colleagues to:a. agree the list of Essential and Programme Bills set out inAnnex A;b. note the Contingent Bills in Annex B, and agree that theyshould be brought forward if necessary;2CONFIDENTIAL
