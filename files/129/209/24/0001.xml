CONFIDENTIALS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 4929 July 1980CABINETCOMPENSATION AND PRIVATISATION OF SHIPBUILDINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Industry1. We are encountering great difficulties on compensation for thenationalised shipbuilding and aircraft companies.    Those 14 companieswhose values declined between the reference period and vesting day havesettled.    But six companies, British Aircraft Corporation (BAC), (Vickersand General Electric Company (GEC)), Vosper, Yarrow, Brooke Marineand Hall Russell, are strongly pees sing the Government to change the termsof compensation.    The value of all these six companies in the three yearsbetween the reference period set by the Nationalisation Act for thepurpose of valuation and vesting day rose strongly and the differentialbetween the reference period value and the possible vesting day value hasproduced a sense of outrage.   The issue of compensation is also closelylinked with the determination of policy on privatisation.THE OPTIONS2. The possible options can be summarised as:i. To change the compensation terms of the 1977 Act and notto privatise.ii. To try to meet the unfairness of the compensation termsby offering the warship yards back to the previous owners atcompensation values.iii. To offer the yards back at market value.iv. As variants of ii. and iii. to offer up to 75 per cent of theequity of the yards with the Government retaining a minimum of25 per cent to prevent foreign control.v. To accept the recommendations of the Minister of State forIndustry to the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy,Sub-Committee on Economic Affairs that privatisation should notproceed this year and that there should be no change in the basisof compensation.1COPY NO82CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3. These options are discussed below but the considerations attachingto each are summarised in the matrix at Annex A.SHOULD THE TERMS OF COMPENSATION BE CHANGED {OPTION i)?4. Any new legislation to change the terms of compensation would beretrospective and would create a whole new range of problems and freshunfairness.   It would be resented by the thousands who sold their sharesin Vickers, Yarrow and Vosper on the basis of the previous terms ofcompensation.   It would cost at least  130 million to give a choice of analternative and later reference period.   Reversing the compensation termsof a previous Parliament would set a precedent.    I would not recommendexchanging one hornet&apos;s nest for another, particularly at such a cost to theExchequer.OFFER BACK AT COMPENSATION VALUE OR MARKET VALUE(OPTIONS ii and iii)?5. These options involve privatisation of British Shipbuilders (BS) andthe substantial adverse effects including disruption of the industry arediscussed in paragraphs 13-15.   As will be seen from Annex B the previousowners have expressed some interest, in principle, in repurchasing butwithout much enthusiasm and subject to the proviso that the sale price isrelated to the compensation to be paid.   It will be noted that Vajptr inparticular envisaged the formation of a warship division as an intermediatestep before the company is offered back to the original owners because ofprobable trade union reaction.6. A sale at compensation value would be an arbitrary figure whichtook no account of the changes in asset value since vesting or in futureprospects.    We should be criticised for selling below market value at theexpense of the taxpayer and it would encourage further the Opposition tothreaten to renationalise at arbitrary and penal levels.   The attitude ofthe Opposition could make it impossible to float British Aerospace anddamage our general privatisation programme.7. It would be no defence to argue that, with compensation not beingsettled, the yards in question could be handed back to the former ownerson the basis that &apos;the contract&apos; for their takeover by the State has not beenimplemented.    There is no legal basis for such an argument.    The yardsare vested in BS through an Act of Parliament which also sets out the basisfor compensation, but the transfer of title has taken place regardless ofthe fact that compensation remains to be assessed.   Arbitration isprovided for if compensation cannot be agreed.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL8. On top of these difficulties we must expect other former owners,apart from the war shipbuilders, to demand comparable treatment* Therecould be even one or two instances in the shipbuilding industry which wouldadd to uncertainties.   I should certainly expect the former owners of BAC(Vickers and GEC) to lobby hard with Sir Arnold Weinstock to the fore.We could not give them the same treatment because their previousundertakings are no longer discrete businesses within British Aerospaceand we are committed to denationalising them as a single unit.Nevertheless, the argument could well influence the outstandingcompensation negotiations about BAC which have come very close tosettlement.9. If, however, we sell back the yards following negotiations on anestimated market value based on merchant bank advice, the difficultieswill be considerably mitigated but not altogether removed. Unless theyards are sold by flotation, there is no demonstrable market value andthe Opposition will, no doubt, suspect that the sale price to the previousowners will have been affected by other considerations.10. Preliminary indications of market value are that the result maynot be very different in some cases from compensation value, as illustratedat Annex C.    In some cases, of course, the differential could be sufficientto bring sharply back into focus the &apos;inadequate1 level of compensation.PREVENTION OF FOREIGN CONTROL (Option iv)U.        We need to consider whether to take steps to prevent subsequentsale of the war shipbuilders by the previous owners to foreign buyers.This would involve inter alia the retention of a minimum Government25 per cent shareholding following the pattern envisaged for BritishAerospace.12 .      Such a step could be helpful in attracting moderate opinion andwould be seen as desirable particularly in the case of Vickers with theinvolvement in Trident..   However, such a step could make it harder tosatisfy the previous owners.SHOULD WE DEFER PRIVATISATION WITHOUT ANY CHANGE INCOMPENSATION TERMS (OPTION v)?13.       The options on sale to the previous owners involve immediateprivatisation and are also inextricably linked with future policy on theshipbuilding industry.    The adverse consequences of immediateprivatisation which we would have to reckon with are in brief:i.        An adverse effect on the Public Sector BorrowingRequirement of some  50 million because the advance paymentsof the war shipbuilder 8 ( 76 million) held on deposit by BS faroutweigh possible disposal value.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALii. Serious disruption of the industry which could cost a further 50 million, and aggravation of the difficulties in handling anyfurther contraction of the industry in areas of already very highunemployment.iii. The Opposition could regard the legislation as so controversialthat it would probably adopt delaying tactics over the wholeGovernment programme and we would, therefore, have to resort tofrequent use of the guillotine.14. The new Chairman of BS has stressed that sale of the warshipbusiness would render the prospect of returning to viability the remainingpart of the industry unlikely of achievement.   In his view there would beimmediate resignations from the Board, and acceleration of the loss ofkey personnel, the withdrawal of co-operation by the unions and a furtherdecline of the industry with serious implications for the marine equipmentindustry whose stability is already threatened.CONCLUSION15. While I fully appreciate the deep seated sense of grievance felt byformer owners whose assets rose in value before vesting day, I see noacceptable way of changing the terms of compensation.   The disadvantageof immediate privatisation seem to me so overwhelming as to preclude anyearly offer back of former yards.16. I therefore seek my colleagues&apos; agreement to announcing adeferment of privatisation with no change in the terms of compensationeither through an oral statement or written Parliamentary Question on thelines set out at Annex D.K JDepartment of Industry29 July 19804CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALANNEX BH   if   0&lt; VIEWS OF PREVIOUS OWNERS - EXTRACTS FROM LETTERS J*Vesperr&quot;There are a number of ways to achieve /privatisation/, &quot;but in view ofthe timescales envisaged and current objections from the Trade Unionsto de-nationalise, there might be merit in undertaking this operationin two parts :-1 To form a separate Company to control the three lead WarshipYards and this Company would be responsible direct to theDepartment of Industry or the Ministry of Defence. Thiswould still be a nationalised organisation, somewhat similar-to Aerospace.   The Directors of the Controlling Company wouldin the main be from Industry and the Company would operate acentral Marketing and Sales Organisation and also co-ordinatedesign work undertaken in each yard.2 Subsequently to return the Warshipbuilding Industry to theprivate sector in which respect the following options are submitted for consideration:-a      Offer each Company back to the origianl owners on amutually agreed basis which would be related to theamount of compensation ultimately received and thethen financial circumstances of the companies.b      To offer shares to the public in the ControllingCompany referred to in (1) above, either wholly orif preferred a &quot;BP&quot; arrangement.c      As (b), but for each company separately.&quot;Yarrow .&quot;In regard to the denationalisation issue, there are a number of ways bywhich this objective could be achieved and they are given purely as abasis for discussion and without knowledge of the present financialcircumstances of Yarrow (Shipbuilders) Limited and their future pros-pects.   Yarrow and Company&apos;s favoured choice would be re-acquisition ofYarrow (Shipbuilders) Limited as a wholly-owned subsidiary for amutually agreed price not greater than the amount of compensationultimately received.   If the Government wished to retain some publicsector participation or to allow Trades Unions and employees to have aproportion of the equity, this would be a matter for negotiation butYarrow and Company would wish to retain more than 75%.If the Government preferred a &quot;BP-type&quot; arrangement involving a formalgrouping of the three principal warshipbuilders within a holding company.Yarrow and Company would be willing under certain conditions to sub-scribe for a proportion of the equity of such a company.   The threeprevious owners should have a prior,option to subscribe for agreedproportions of the equity capital, at a share price bearing the samerelationship to present net asset values as the compensation settle-ments will bear to net asset values at vesting date.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALWithin this framework arrangements could be made for the Governmentretain a minority interest and to make shares available on subscripto Trades Unions, employees and the public.&quot;Vickers&quot;On the assumption that the activities of the warshipbuilders are noinextricably interwoven with the remainder of the industry, and subto suitable safeguards on the allocation of future naval orders, Ifeel that urgent consideration ought to be given to hiving off thissector to private industry. I have no strong views as to whether tshould be a complete offer, or whether it should be on the lines ofthe proposed British Aerospace placing.I would submit that there is a very strong case in equity for respethe position of the former owners by offering them pre-emptive righwhich would take account of the price at which the assets were acqufrom them in the first place.I do understand that this proposition is fraught with difficultiescertain to arouse opposition from Trades Unions and others, neverthless, there is a mandate to do so and there is for the time beingsufficient relevant management to make it successful.&quot;

C(CONFIDENTIALANNEX &apos;D&apos;DRAFT STATEMENT ON COMPENSATION AND PRIVATISATIONTlie House will know that the Government has &quot;been considering whethernow is the appropriate.time to announce proposals to introduceprivate sector capital into shipbulding and shiprepair.   This reviewwas begun when there were some signs of recovery in the market andthere was still a reasonable expectation that BS would be able toget on course for their financial limits this year without the needfor substantial corrective action.   As I told the House last weekthese hopes have been disappointed.   There are still considerableuncertainties surrounding the industry and the Chairman has advisedus that to introduce private capital at the present time would makesubstantially more difficult his task in making the Corporationviable and inevitably delay the time when viability is achieved.We have accordingly decided to defer proceeding at this stage.2        Generally the only part of BS which could have attracted privatecapital at the present time are the specialist warshipbuilders. Ihave received many representations about the yards from the previousowners on the unfairness of the compensation terms laid down in the1977 Nationalisation Act.   While in Opposition, we strongly criticisedthese provisions and rightly so.   However, the introduction ofamending legislation would create new difficulties and fresh unfair-ness for the shareholders who sold on the basis of the present terms.In the light of these difficulties and after the most careful andsympathetic consideration of the representations made to me, I havewith reluctance concluded that we cannot change the present compen-sation provisions.CONFIDENTIAL
