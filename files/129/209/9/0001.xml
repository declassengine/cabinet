SECRET;UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 34 COPY NO L*T27 June 1980CABINET1 HE PAY OF MINISTERS, MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENTAND SENIOR PUBLIC SERVANTS: TOP SALARIESREVIEW BODY REPORTS 14 AND 15Note by the Secretary of the Cabinet!        In summing up the Cabinet&apos;s preliminary discussion of the 14th Reportof the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) on 19 June (CC(80) 24th Conclusions,Minute 4), the Prime Minister said that she would arrange for a detailedstudy of the possibilities for dealing with this report, and the parallel reporton the pay of Ministers and Members of Parliament, and for the options tobe presented for the Cabinet&apos;s consideration.2        I attach a note by officials in fulfilment of this remit.Signed ROBERT ARMSTRONGCabinet Officel&quot;i June 1980SECRET
SECRETTOP SALARIES REVIEW BODY:REPORTS 14 and 15. Note by OfficialsTSHB 14 deals with the salaries of the higher Civil Service, seniorficers in the armed forces, the higher judiciary and chairmen and boardmbers     nationalised industries.     TSRB 15 deals with the pay ofistei. and Members of Parliament.The groups covered by the reports stand in various different positionsrelation to staging and updating;i. The TSRB 14 groups have had all three of their stages, andtheir salaries have since 1 April 1980 been at the level thatthe TSRB thought right for 1 April 1979.     The question at issueis by how much those 1979 rates should be increased to bring themto levels appropriate for a 1980 settlement.ii. Members of Parliament have had the first two stagesof their updating, and have a third stage due in 1981. Theirsalaries have since 13 June 1980 been at the level which it wasagreed in 1979 they should be at that date.     Again, the questionat issue is by how much the 1979 rates should be increased tobring them to levels appropriate for a 1980 settlement.iii. Ministers have had only the first of their three stagedincreases.     They are-due for the second stage, to bring themto the level which it was agreed in 1979 they should be in June 1980.The Cabinet has agreed in principle that they should receivethe second stage.     When they get it, they will be in exactly thesame position as Members of Parliament.     The question at issuewill then be one of updating for 1979-80.     For simplicity&apos;s sakeit is assumed in what follows that the second stage for Ministersis not in question, and it has been included in the figures forcurrent salaries.     On this basis the matter of staging can be put1SECRET
SECRETon one side, and the issue for decision is the same for eachgroup:   by how much the current salaries, which are in 1979terms, should be increased to bring them up to date for a 1980settlement.3      The TSHB 14 recommends increases of about 30 per cent forCivil Service Under Secretaries and Army Major Generals, and equivalent,to give them a tolerable differential against the grades and ranksimmediately below them.     In doing so the TSRB are responding to aspecific request by this Government to deal with the problem of the&quot;interface&quot;.     For the Under Secretaries the &quot;floor&quot; from which thedifferential has to be assessed is the top of the Assistant Secretaryscale.     The pay research evidence indicated a rate of  22,000 for thetop of the Assistant Secretary scale.     The TSRB 14 recommends a rateof  23,500 for the Under-Secretary.     It is impossible to reduce that andpreserve a reasonable differential, unless the Assistant Secretarymaximum can be brought below  22,000.     The Staff Side would seek to goto arbitration on any lower figure than  22,000, and they would almostcertainly win.     In order to enforce a lower rate the Government wouldhave to refuse arbitration.     The Government is, however, committed bya letter to the Staff Side to allowing arbitration for the AssistanrSecretaries if an &quot;interface&quot; problem with Under Secretaries stillexists after the implementation of TSRB 14.     This letter was marked&quot;without prejudice&quot; so that technically it could be withdrawn; butwithdrawal would give rise to considerable embarrassment and acutecriticism.4.     There is also an Interface&quot; problem, though it is less acute, inthe armed forces, where the Armed Forces Review Body recommended a salaryfor Brigadiers and equivalent ranks some  5,000 less than that recommendedby TSHB 14 for Major Generals (who are paid the same as Under Secretaries);Medical Brigadiers will however be paid  21,000 if the current recommendatof the AFPBB are accepted (and the government&apos;s commitment to the ArmedForces applies to them).     The rate for Major Generals cannot thereforebe reduced below about  22,500 if a reasonable differential is to beprovided.2SECRET
SECRET5.   Ministers have to decide whether to risk going to arbitration fora maximum of less than  22,00.0 for the Assistant Secretary, or to imposea lower figure and refuse arbitration, despite the commitment to allowit.   Tills is a crucial decision, because if it is accepted, theAssistant Secretary maximum has to be not less than  22,000.     A figure lessthan the  25,500 recommended by TSRB 14 for Under Secretaries would leavewholi   inadequate differential.     That recommendation represents an&apos;ncreas  of about 30 per cent, and as the weight of numbers is in thisgrade mvl the corresponding service ranks, it would then be impossible toring th j average increase for the higher Civil Service and the seniorbfficera within a figure of 14 per cent, let alone.any lower figure.It would however be possible to go for a pattern of figures which gavethe recGsflmended 30 per cent to the lowest grades covered by TSRB 14 andshaded the percentage increases for the higher grades to levels belowthose recommended by TSRB.5.   There are a number of established relativities between the groupscovered by TSRB 14, and it would be very much better to avoid disturbing;hese in whatever the Government decides, save where the TSRB has itselfrecommended doing so.     It has in fact proposed to. break the former linksletween the Civil Service and the higher judiciary:   for instanceligh Court Judges and Permanent Secretaries are both paid  28,500 atpresent, but for reasons set out in Chapter 4 of TSRB 14 the recommendationswild give the High Court Judges  35 000, , 1,000 more than is recommended&apos;or the Permanent Secretaries.     This change reflects the generallifficulty being experienced, as the Lord Chancellor said in Cabinet on19 June,&apos;in recruiting judges of adequate calibre, given the levels oflaraings at the Bar..   In the options suggested in this note it has been assumed thathe recommendations for chairmen and board members of nationaliseddustries should be delayed or modified on the same basis as those forhe other groups.     It is arguable that, if the TSRB recommendations arebe modified, there is not much point in implementing modifiedRecommendations for the chairmen and board members when they are aboutlobe taken out of the TSBB&apos;s terms of reference.     On the other hand it5SECRET
SECRETwill take tine to settle new rates for each of the industries separately,given the need for co-ordination, and it may be sensible to implementModified recommendations for this group as well as the rest, and allow moretime for the individual reviews that will be necessary.8. Whatever decision is taken on salary levels will need to beaccompanied by a decision on implications for pensions.     The decisionsrequired are indicated below.     The only general point that should bemade is that compressing differentials too much can make problems forpensions in future as well as inadequate reward for increased responsibilitin the present.THE OPTIONS9. One option is clearly to pay the rates recommended by TSRB 14from the due date.     These are summarised in column B of the annexedtable.10. Xf the re commendations are to be modified, they can be modifiedeither as to amount, by reducing the salary rates, or as to date, bydelaying implementation.     This note deals with the latter first.DELATING IMPLEMENTATION11. The average cost of the increases recommended for all groups,including MPs and Ministers, is 24 per cent in a full year. Eachmonth by which implementation is delayed reduces the average cost in1980-81 by 2 per cent.     The table below sets out various possibilities:Length of delayin months3456Imp1ementati ondate TSRB 14Imp1erne nt at i ondate TSRB 151 July 1980 13 September 19801 August 1980 13 October 19801 September 1980 13 November 19801 October 1980 13 December 1980Average percent?increase in cos1980-8118161412These dates are on the assumption that the groups covered by the tworeports should be treated as a single whole.     It would be possible toseparate them in which case the deferment period required for MPs toSECRET
SECRETachieve a given percentage increase in the wage hill in 1980-81 wouldlie considerably shortened, and that for the TSRB 14 groups would bea little lengthened.12. The disadvantages of delaying implementation are -a. this would appear to be Press and public as a lesselective demonstration of Government determinationto restrain the growth of public sector pay, because the resultingt i centage increases in salaries at particular levels as reportedin the Press would be the same as those recommended by TSRB 14;b, the price of reducing the average percentage increase incost in 1980-81 would be a larger increase in cost in 1981-82,when the full-year cost would have to be met, plus the costof any further increases that came into effect next year.13. But there are so few salaries involved in these groups thatthe increased cost is a relatively small problem, and the advantagesof proceeding by delaying the implementation of. the TSRB recommendationsrather than modifying them are -a. if the recommended rates are accepted, even if theirimplementation is delayed, there will not be a &quot;catching up&quot;problem and the risk of ever more embarrassingly large increasesnext year or the year after;b. it would avoid all the problems of compressing differentialsand distorting relativities that would result from reducing theamounts of the recommendations, though there would have to betransitional arrangements at the &quot;interfaces&quot; for the periodof the delay;c. the recommended rates could be applied for pension purposeswith effect from the dates recommended by the TSRB for pensionpurposes, and there could be no permanent damage to pensionbenefits;5SECRET
SECRETd.   it would avoid the difficulties for recruitment from theprivate sector (Judges and Nationalised Industry Boards) whichwould be the consequences of any of the options involvingreductions in salaries.REDUCING SALARY RATES14. The choice of options for illustration in the annex has beendetermined by the ideas being canvassed in relation to salaries ofMPs.       TSRB 15 has recommended a rate of  12,300 for MPs; thisrepresents an increase of 14.6 per cent.     One possibility underconsideration is to reduce that figure to  12,000.     That would beexpressed either as reducing the recommended increase from 14.6 to11.9 per cent, or as reducing the recommended new salary rate by2f- percentage points.15. We have therefore produced figures showing the effect of reducingthe TSRB 14 increases to 12 per cent or 14 per cent, and showing theeffect of reducing the increases recommended by the same proportionatereduction as would be represented by a 2| percentage points reductionfor MPs (about one-sixth) or by reducing the recommended rates by2-J per cent.    We have also produced figures on the annex showing theresulting salary rates for all groups concerned on the following basisColumn A.Column B.Column C.Column D.Column E.Column F.Current salariesRates recommended by TSRBCurrent salaries increased by 12 per cent.Current salaries increased by 14 per cent.TSBB recommended salary increases reduced in proportionto the reduction in the increase in MPs1 pay (ie reduceall increases by approximately one-sixth)TSRB recommended salaries reduced by l\ per cent.The options in Columns C, D, E and F are available only if Ministersdecide to refuse arbitration and reduce the Assistant Secretary maximumto something less than  22,000, to whatever extent is necessary to leavea differential of about  1,500 against the Under Secretary.     In the6SECRET
SECRETpied forces, there is no question of refusing arbitration: theirer rates are set. by the AFPHB.     The remaining options show thetes that would result from accepting an Assistant Secretary maximumnot Wis than  22,000 and the TSRB recommended rate of  23,500 forier Si cretaries, Major Generals and equivalents, while reducing thecreas i for higher grades by various amounts compatible with retaining aasonabfe salary structure.     Pour ways of doing this are illustrated:e highest salaries increased by 12 per cent or 14 per cent from presenttes a id TSRB recommended rates reduced to match either interpretationthe  roposed reduction in the increase recommended for MPs.     Once thegores have been rounded and modified to make a sensible progressionLth reasonable differentials, there is really no difference between theist two calculations.ilumn G. 12 per cent plus additions for differentialsilumn H. 14 per cent plus additions for differentialsilumn J.       TSRB recommended increases reduced to match the6.   If salary rates less than those recommended by the TSRB weremposed, those new rates would presumably apply for pension purposes,he effect would be permanent, to depress the pensions of those whoetire with pensions based on these rates.     Whatever the unfairnessf that, it would not produce anomalies if this year&apos;s depression ofalaries continued into the future and was never made good.     If, one other hand, the depression of salaries was thought of as a temporaryase, and it was expected that there would eventually be a catching up,hen questions of justice..between pensioners would arise.     If in ordero avoid this it was desired that the TSRB recommended rates shouldpply in full for pensions purposes, it would be necessary for thevernment to promulgate those rates as correct for 1 April 1980or 13 June 1980) and to commit itself to paying salaries at those ratest some time in the future (which need not be specified).     There is a precedentor that in what was done for MPs in 1975*lolumn K.proposed reduction in the increase in MPs&apos; pay plusaddition for differentials (ie a reduction of one sixthof the increase)TSHB recommended rates minus 2- - per cent plus additionsfor differentials.7SECRET
SECRET17.     Finally, Ministers will need to make a judgement of the effectof their decisions upon the Review Bodies;   bearing in mind that, ifthe Government&apos;s decisions fell short of the TSRB&apos;s recommendationsby enough to provoke them to resign, the other two Review Bodies(for Armed Forces Pay and Doctors and Dentists Remuneration) would beimmediately concerned about the implications for them, and might wellresign in sympathy.     Any judgement must he speculative:   for what itis worth, officials believe that  a. tiie TSRB probably would resign if the Government rejectedtheir recommendations and substituted rates as low as 12 or 14 percent for the TSRB 14 groups and ignored their proposals fordealing with the &quot;interface&quot; problems (Columns C and D);b. the TSRB might not resign if the Government accepted theirrecommendations for the &quot;interface&quot; grades and shaded theincreases down to 12 or 14 per cent at the top (Columns G and H);c. the TSRB would probably not resign if the Government reducedtheir recommended rates to match the.proposed reduction in therates recommended for MPs or implemented their recommendationsin full but delayed implementation (paragraph 11, andColumns E, F, J and K).Cabinet Office27 June 19808SECRET
