CONFIDENTIALTOP SALARIES REVIEW BODY : SUMMARY OP REPORT No 141. The Top Salaries Review Body covers the higherCivil Service, senior officers of the Armed Forces,the higher {judiciary and nationalised industry Chairmenand Board members - 2,000 people in all.   Report No 14was sent to the Prime Minister on 12 June. Itrecommends increases averaging 25.8% (they vary from16.2$ to 30.695) with effect from 1 April 1980. Thetotal annual cost of the recommended increases for allgroups is  10.9 million.2. The Review Body has taken into account movements inoutside salaries over the past year, but has givenparticular attention to the problem of compression andoverlap between the salaries within its remit andsalaries immediately below.   In the case of the nationalisedindustries, there has been a deteriorating relationshipbetween the salaries of Board members and those of seniormanagers reporting to the Board.    In the higher CivilService, there has been the compression between the UnderSecretary and the maximum of the Assistant Secretary scale,negotiated on the basis of pay research evidence; andsimilarly in the Armed Forces the differential between theMajor General (and equivalent) and the Brigadier (andequivalent) has narrowed.   In the case of judges, theReview Body has examined the level of earnings at the Barin years prior to appointment.   These considerations haveled the Review Body to recommend higher increases for thoseat the lower levels of the groups within their remit thanfor those at the top.   Examples of the detailed recommend-ations are attached.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3,    In the case of the nationalised industries, xneReview Body has also recommended wider pay rangesfor Board members and deputy chairmen (and moreflexible movement within those ranges) in order toreward merit; and freedom to pay certain chairmen upto 10$ more than the recommended rate in certaincircumstances.   The Review Body has, however, expresseddoubts about its role in this area, because of thedifficulty in reconciling a &quot;review body&quot; approach witha &quot;market rate&quot; approach.4.    The review body concludes that if Government andParliament do not feel that its proposals are right, itis for them to set different terms of reference or totake responsibility for new means of carrying out itspresent functions.CONFIDENTIAL
