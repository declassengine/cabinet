CONFIDENTIALC ACUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 47COPY NO    3 K23 July 1980CABINE1PAY, PENSIONS AND ALLOWANCES OF MEMBERSOF PARLIAMENT: VIEWS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster1. In the debate en 21 July on the Government&apos;s motions to increaseParliamentary pay and allowances, the House of Commons passed four mainamendments against the Government&apos;s advi&lt;j .    These were:-i.      to regard Members of Parliament&apos;s (MPs) pay for pensionpurposes as  13, 750 immediately (the Top Salaries Review Body(TSRB) recommended rate);ii*       to link MPs&apos; salaries to &quot;a specified grade in the publicservice&quot;;iii. to increase the accrual rate for MPs&apos; pensions from l/60thto l/40th of pensionable salary for each year&apos;s service;iv. to increase the secretarial allowance to  8, 000 in a full year(the TSRB rate); we had proposed only  7,400 - 9. 6 per cent up enthe current rate,2. I was left in n*&gt; doubt about the very strong feelings of the House.Members would be in no mood to accept the Government&apos;s recommendationson these four points if we were to restate our earlier position.   We shall haveto go some way to meeting the House otherwise we shall be defeated again.My proposals on each amendment are as follows:PENSIONABLE PAY3. This amendment will imply that the pensionable pay rate of  13, 750is the &quot;proper rate for the job&quot;, although we need not be committed to payingthis &quot;proper rate&quot; from any particular time.    The difficulty with it is thatthe other TSRB groups whose increases were reduced are very likely todemand similar treatment.    We must therefore decide whether to offer theTSRB 14 groups - and indeed Ministers - the TSRB rates for pension purposes,or to try to defend a distinction between the two groups.4. On the other hand, the amendment was supported by the Executive ofthe 1922 Committee, and I therefore see no alternative to accepting it andannouncing our decision as soon as possible.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALLINKAGE5. Again, this was a well- supported amendment and I think we shouldaccept it.    The precise link is left unspecified in the current amendmentand it is difficult to determine a valid one.    We need only announce that wewill bring forward detailed proposals in due course.   Although the amend-ment refers to &quot;a specified grade in the public service&quot;, I think it would bereasonable to say that we wished to look more widely at possible linkages.PENSIONS ACCRUAL RATE6. Here again I do not think that we have very much alternative toaccepting the decision of the House but we could seek to neutralise itsdrawbacks by the scheme we eventually put forward, eg by raising Members&apos;contributions, keeping it non-retrospective etc.    There has long been awidespread feeling among MPs that  their pensions should accrue faster inview of their relatively short service (on average) and the uncertainties of aParliamentary career.    But there are considerable difficulties. Theproposal would double the present Exchequer contribution to theParliamentary pension fund.    There could be repercussions for other publicservice groups who might seek a similar improvement themselves. TSRBexamined this question in their 13th Report published in February, andconcluded that the accrual rate for MPs should not be improved.7. I think it will be necessary to accept the House&apos;s views in principle.It is a very complex and technical area and we cannot go further than thisin the immediate future without full consideration of the issues. Irecommend therefore that we should not at this stage go beyond acceptance inprinciple, but undertake to examine the proposal in more detail and to makefull proposals to the House in introducing the legislation on Parliamentarypensions planned for the next Session.SECRETARIAL ALLOWANCE8. This is too small a matter on which to quarrel with the House. Irecommend that we accept the TSRB rate of  8, 000 in a full year.    The onlyrepercussion would be on the secretarial allowance for Ministers in the Lordsand it would be right to treat this similarly - ie to pay the full TSRB rate of 1,175.TIMING9*      We ought to announce our decisions as soon as possible.    I suggest thatI make a statement on Thursday and follow it up with a revised effectivemotion on MPs pay as soon as possible.CONCLUSIONS10.    I invite the Cabinet to agree that I should make a statement onThursday, saying that:-2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALi.       The Government accepts the views of the House onpensionable pay, linkage and the secretarial allowance.ii.
