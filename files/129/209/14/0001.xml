CONFIDENTIALCLCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 39 COPY NO 823 July 1980CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITUREs MAIN ISSUESNote by the Chief Secretary, TreasuryThe attached paper by Treasury officials is circulated as background tothe Cabinet&apos;s discussion of the 1980 Public Expenditure Survey.    It hasbeen prepared in accordance with the proposals in my minute of28 February to the Prime Minister concerning the preliminary work forthe 1980 Survey.   It summarises the main issues which are likely to arisein the course of the Survey.WJBTreasury Chambers3 July 1980CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY 1980:THE MAIN ISSUESNote by the Treasuryhis paper by Treasury officials is to summarise the Government&apos;sxpenditure plans as they now stand and to indicate some generalssues which arise from the additional bids and options foreductions which have been put forward by Departments in thisear&apos;s public expenditure survey.   The detailed material haseen circulated separately, for reference.Last year the Government set a new strategy and directionor public expenditure, in the plans published on Budget Day inmid 7841     The theme was a progressive reduction in the volumef public expenditure over the period to 1983-84.   The planseflected the Government&apos;s view of priorities and their objectivef improving efficiency.   On the assumptions of the medium-terminancial strategy published at the same time the plans would beonsistent with the intended path for the public sector borrowingequirement, and thus with the overriding objective of progressiveeduction in money supply growth.   It was stated that publicxpenditure plans, tax policies and interest rates will bedjusted as necessary in order to achieve the money supplybjective.The present 1980 survey is the first annual review of thelans in Cmnd 7841.   The period covered is to be one year shorterhan in previous surveys, so it deals with the years 1981-82 to983-84.The two basic questions are:What changes have occurred or are in prospect inthe public expenditure plans as they now stand?Has the general economic prospect changed in a waywhich calls for revision of the plans to sustainthe medium-term financial strategy?CONFIDENTIAL
UOJNJflJJ&amp;iMTxALChanges agreed or inevitable5. Some increases and decreases are already agreed or inevitablein the plans in Crand 7841.   Table 1 shows the main components,and the further proposals for change made by Departments.6. The outcome of the European Community negotiations, togetherwith some other changes in the estimated UK contribution, producessavings estimated to rise from around  400 million in 1981 -.82 l,oaround  750 million in 1983-84 after taking account of the oxtr.-icosts of the agricultural settlement, and on stylised assumptionsfor the years after 1.981.7. Certain estimating increases on various programmes cannotbe avoided, but can in some cases be offset by savings in otherexpenditure.    Increases of this sort amount to some  170 millionin 1981-82, but in that year are more than offset by reductionson other programmes arising from such factors as revisions ineconomic assumptions.8. The result of these changes| and of the gas levy (see paragraph13 below), is totals between      and       below those in Cmnd 7841.Pay9. Following the &quot;catching up&quot; settlements, further increasesin public service pay are assumed to be overall somewhat lessthan those in private sector pay.    If public service pay were torise faster, further cuts in the volume of expenditure would benecessary to contain the cost of public expenditure within thefigures now envisaged: see paragraph 19 below.Pressures for increases10. In certain programmes there is strong pressure for increases.11. Pour loss-making nationalised industries - coal, rail, steeland shipbuilders - face problems in keeping within the previousplans*   Precise figures cannot be determined yet. Meanwhileit would be prudent not to assume the shortfall in the industries&apos;financing requirements contained in the last White Paper. Onthis basis, and allowing for changes in the other industries&apos;plans and for delays in the flotation of British Aerospace (butbefore making any option cuts), the nationalised industries1finance would be  f billion or so higher in each year. Towhat extent can or should this threat be averted by policies forCONFIDENTIAL
OOWJfiiJEJNTlAlithe loss-makers and by making the option cuts, mainly reductionsin investment plans, included in the separate report to Ministers?12. There are other threats in the industrial sector, notablyMis Royce (perhaps an extra  100 million in 1981-82), andBritish Leyland.   The Department of Industry has additional bidsamounting to over  100 million in 1981-82: the Secretary of Stateis seeking offsetting savings, and it remains to be ssen whatcan be done.13. The gas levy agreed by Ministers earlier this year willreduce BGC&apos;s internal resources and so increase public expenditureby amounts rising from around  350 million or more in 1981-82 topossibly  700 million or more in 1983-84-, depending on the rate oflevy; but there will be no effect on the PSBR.14. The prospect of industrial recession is also reflected inthe Department of Employment&apos;s proposals that, in addition to eeting extra demands or the redundancy and maternity pay funds,provision should be made to continue throughout the period thetemporary short-time working scheme and the job release schemeat the 1980-81 levels.   These schemes have hitherto been fundedyear to year.15. Local authorities&apos; budgets for 1980-81 imply current expen-diture some 2-3% over the present plans (about    billion at 1980survey prices).   The Government have asked for revised budgets,and Ministers are considering other possibilities for correctiveaction.   Can and should further action be taken to achieve thefarther reductions already planned for 1981-82 and the lateryears?   Should further provision be made in the relevant programmes-to allow for the possibility that local authorities will notadhere to the Government&apos; s plans?15. Other programmes where major additions have been proposedare:(i) Education   The school transport defeat will cost 40-50 million a year.   Additional bids &quot;to maintainand improve the quality of education&quot; ih&apos;&quot;sChoOls, baseaCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALon a Queen&apos;s Speech commitment, rise, from  30 millionin 1981-82 to over  100 million in 1983-84.    A reportby Treasury and DES officials on schools expenditure isbeing submitted separately to Ministers and it iii forconsideration exactly what is implied by the Government&apos;scommitment.(ii) Health.   The delayed introduction of the Road Traffic Actcharging proposals, caused by H Committee&apos;s reservations,and the lower income now expected from overseas visitorswill cost some  80 million in 1981-82 and  15 million inlater years.   Withdrawal of the sight test charge will cost 10 million a year.   Against this has to be set a Manifestocommitment to maintain the planned growth of healthspending, and a list of options for reductions which wererejected by Cabinet in the last survey.(iii) Social security.   Bids rise to  700 million in 1983-84.About half represent including in the social securityprogramme provision for uprating child benefits in linewith prices from its value in November 1980. (Provisionfor future uprating has so far been contained in thecontingency reserve.)   The bulk of the remaining bids arefor higher increases in child benefit, and for restoringthis year&apos;s cuts in the real value of certain rshort-term and other benefits, which cannot all be settledimmediately.   If Ministers have to plan for earnings torise by less than prices in the immediate future, it isreasonable to consider less than full price indexationof at least some ber.efits.Scope for reductions17. Local authority current expenditure, nationalised industryfinance, the health service, rocial security and defence togetheramount to three-quarters of total expenditure.   Increases in anyof these programmes, or a redrction in the total, must largely bemet by reductions elsewhere in these areac, for the scope forfinding offsetting savings in the rest of the publis expenditureis limited.18. To the extent that further net reductions are needed, eitherto produce a satisfactory prospect, .for the PSBR or to offsetunavoidable additions, it will be necessary to draw on theoptions for reductions in the survey report.   Different typesCONFIEBNTIAL
CONFIDENTIALof expenditure (eg procurement, transfers, or receipts fromcharges) have different effects on the PSBR and money supply.In present circumstances the effect on industrial activity willalso be particularly relevant, and this has a bearing on thechoice between capital and current expenditure referred to inparagraph 23.OTHER ISSUESCost movements19. The plans published in the last White Paper have been updatedfor a year&apos;s movements in costs, ie. broadly from 1978-79 to1979-80 price levels.   The cash needed in 1981-82 to fulfil theseplans would be higher still, because of the further effects ofpay awards in the last round (eg. staged payments), known new paysettlements in the current round, and forecast further pay andprice movements up to 1981,-82.   Table 2 compares.,the expected increasesince the white Paper in the cost or plannerl public expenditure on goodsIservices in 1981-82, with the expected price movements in theeconomy generally.   For some Departments - notably Defence,Environment (other environmental services), Home Office, DES, DHSS(health and personal social services) and Scotland - the increasein costs is noticeably higher than general inflation.   This upward&quot;creep&quot; is largely due to the working through of the Clegg awardsand other staged comparability pay settlements.   Should the volumeof the programmes which show significant increases in relativecost be trimmed back to contain the eventual cash expenditure?Manpower20. Ministers have decided to reduce civil service manpower bya further 8% by 1984, but it is not yet settled where thesesavings will be made or how far by contracting out services.These decisions will determine the net expenditure savings.21. Continued pressure on local authorities to reduce manpowerwill be necessary to achieve the planned expenditure cuts.Criticisms of the last White Paper: detail of plans, and capitalversus current22. The last White Paper showed less detail than its predecessorsfor the later years.   This attracted some criticism in Parliament,particularly as to the housing programme.   It was also criticisedas to the nationalised industries, though for these as much detailCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwas published as in previous White Papers.   More detail mustnow be decided for 1981-82, and it must be considered whetherto give more detail than in the last White Paper for the lateryears.23. There has also been criticism of cuts falling more on capitalthan on current expenditure.   Capital expenditure has beendeclining over the last five years at about 9% a year on average;public sector construction has been declining at about 3J% a yearand this has evoked strong protests from the construction lobby.A decision to increase public investment - an analysis in thesurvey report shows effects on the construction industry of additionalbids and options for reductions - would imply looking for offsettingreductions in current expenditure.Cash limits -squeeze 1980-8124. Price, and some pay, increases will be greater in 1980-81 thanprovided for in the cash limits.   The cash limits will consequentlyentail reductions in the volume of most cash-limited services in/some1980-81, of which7 400 million has so far been identified byDepartments.   The 2-J% reduction in civil service manpower in1980-81 is being carried forward into the later years, but theMinistry of Defence propose to apply the savings to other-defence expenditure, keeping the total defence budget unchanged.The sharing of expenditure between Scotland. Wales and NorthernIreland25.   The Ministers principally concerned met earlier this yearto consider whether any action on relative shares of publicexpenditure between the four UK countries should be taken inthe light of the Needs Assessment Study.   They agreed that, whilethere could be no question of a redistribution of existingexpenditure allocations for Scottish, Welsh, Northern Irish andEnglish programmes based simply on the findings of the NeedsAssessment Study, it would be legitimate to take the results of theNeeds Assessment Study into account as a relevant factor indecisions on the distribution of increases or reductions in thepublic expenditure plans.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALriritiflgency reserve6.  Decisions on the size of the contingency reserve are for later,n the autumn.   An ample reserve will be needed to cater for thettcertainties in the economic and industrial prospects and for otherossible bids, eg British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (if Ministers shouldecide that it should no longer raise all its finance from thearket); and to provide for some limited flexibility in the use ofraids between one year and the next, and also to cover pay and pricencreases not allowed for in the Budget.
