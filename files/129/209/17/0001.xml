Following our discussion in Cabinet on the cost of Parliament(C(80) 28 and CC(80) 20th Conclusions, Minute 4), I held a private meetingwith members of the House of Commons Commission on 7 July.2. The Commission considered a paper which I had prepared on thecontrol of Parliamentary expenditure.    It was decided that the Speakershould seek the advice of Sir Robert Speed (Speakers Counsel) on a changein the Instruments of Delegation to ensure that the Commission have a moredirect control over staff increases in the House, and it was also agreed thatan Inspector of Staffing should be appointed.3. On financial expenditure, the Commission decided that in order tohave a greater control in the various departments of the House there shouldbe a small number of Members of Parliament selected to superviseadministration of all departments other than the Library and RefreshmentDepartments, where such bodies already existed.   A member of theCommission should be the Chairman of each of these supervisory bodies.The Commission decided against referring proposals involving significantincreases in expenditure to the Government, as they felt that the Government&apos;sview could be adequately expressed by the Leader of the House.4. It was decided that the Commission could not agree to Governmentcash limits being imposed on the House, but that the Commission itselfwould undertake to impose its own cash limits when it had a complete pictureof the financial expenditure of individual departments.5. The Commission decided that a further report should be obtained onthe proposal that printing should ne longer be paid for out of departmentalvotes, but should be met from the House of Parliament Vote on a repaymentbasis.6. At this stage, the Commission are not proposing to disclose theirconclusions to the House as a whole, but will maintain confidentiality untilthe timing and form of an announcement can be considered.    The record ofthe private meeting is being circulated to the Commission as a formal paperon 15 July.N St J SPrivy Council Office14 July 1980 liHy CONFIDENTIAL
