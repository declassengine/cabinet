CONFIDENTIALUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 4318 July 1980CABINETCIVIL. SERVICE EFFICIENCY AND MANPOWERMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilINTRODUCTION1. Cabinet agreed on 1 May (CC(80) 18th Conclusions, Minute 4) thatall Ministers should draw up plans for achieving our aims of improvingthe efficiency of the Civil Service and reducing its size to around 630, 000by 1 April 1984.2. The reports which colleagues have sent me vary widely. Someimportant points come through.    These include the need to stop work oflesser priori&apos;.y, to examine more rigorously staffing levels not least inso-called &quot;demand-led&quot; areas, and the need for more mechanisation. Iam certain that there is considerable scope for improving efficiency andfinding worthwhile savings in these ways.3. But while we all work for improved efficiency, we must ensure matwe achieve our collective aim of reducing the size of the Civil Service to630,000 announced by the Prime Minister on 13 May. Urderstandably,colleagues have not yet been able fully to set out the means of getting there.There is still a large gap between plans and the aim.    I am particularlyworried about the situation in 1981-82 which is urgent.WHERE EXISTING DECISIONS TAKE US4. Staff in post at 1 April this year numbered 705, 000.    To get down to630, 000, after allowing for a contingency margin of 10, 000 (see paragraph 6below), we therefore need to make reductions totalling 85, 000.    The savingswe agreed last December, together with the Z\ per cent cut to help to payfor this year&apos;s pay settlement, will take us some way along the road.5. Information provided by Departments earlier this year indicated thatnet savings still to come after 1 April 1980 from existing plans would amountto around 30, 000 posts, leaving 55, 000 to come from new savings -equivalent to 8 per cent of the staff in post on 1 April,   Their latest returnshowever show a different picture.    They implemented 10, 000 of theirplanned savings before April leaving that amount less to come.    The newsavings now to be found are therefore 65,000 - equivalent to about 9 per centof staff in post on 1 April.1CONFIDENTIALCOPY NO51
CONFIDENTIALTHE CONTINGENCY MARGIN6. Cabinet on 1 May doubted whether a contingency margin of 10, 000to meet future growth would be big enough.    We cannot tell whether10, 000 will be adequate to meet all future unavoidable claims, but anyhigher figure would require commitment now to still greater savings.I propose that we fix the margin initially at 10, 000, agree to restrictdemands on it rigorously, and see how we go.    If unemployment were torise over 2 million we should have to think again.THE BASELINE7. Some colleagues have questioned the baseline against which the newsavings are to be measured, and have suggested that staff numbers at1 April 197V should be the yardstick.    I see their point but I think we mustbase our new savings on the results of the decisions we have taken so far.The decisions we took last December represented our collective view ofwhat each Department could then contribute.    We should not now go backbehind them and seek to redistribute the burden.PROPOSALS FOR NEW SAVINGS8. How near are we to getting the 65,000 we need?    Some colleagues&apos;offers take us a good way forward and I am very grateful to them. Othersfeel able to contribute very little or have reviews still in progress. Notall the returns are wholly clear, but Annex A provides the best assessmentmy Department can make at this stage of what has been offered.    In totalthis is about 40, 000 posts, with an important part needing legislation. Sov/e have got to make up another 25, 000.9. How are the new savings to be distributed?    Cabinet decided on1 May that there should be flexibility between Departments.    I take thepoint, but flexibility in itself provides no basis on which to reach decisions -hence, no doubt, the varying quality of the latest replies.    Two points seemclear, as before:-a. There is no way we can reach the target without a fullcontribution from the biggest Departments.b. We shall have to temper the wind for prison staff and afew other very limited areas.These two points together show that our room for manoeuvre in practiceis very narrow.   In effect, few Departments can produce much more than9 per cent, and it follows that few can be allowed to produce much less.I see no practical alternative to a cut across the board of 10 per cent inaddition to the decisions we have already announced, thus providing roomCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE MONEY SAVINGS10. The reduction from 705,000 at April 1980 to 630,000 at April 1984will save getting on for  500 million gross a year in wages and salariescosts, on top of the  175 million gross a year already saved.    The netsavings of the whole operation cannot be quantified until we know the off-setting costs where work is being put out to contract.    Moreover, thesesavings will not be achieved unless we are prepared for a modest butessential investment in mechanisation and accommodation.TIMING: 1981-8211. Very few colleagues provided the information requested about thetiming of their new savings and this causes me much concern about thepicture at 1 April 1982.   It looks as if by then numbers may not have fallenmuch below 690, 000.    In mat case 60, 000 more would have to be found inthe following 2 years.    People would simply not believe this to berealistic.    I propose we should bring the April 1982 numbers down to675, 000.    This means that all Departments should reduce their staff inpost by April 1982 to a figure 3 per cent lower than they would reach bythat date under existing plans (ie after taking account of the 2\ per cent cut,the December 1979 savings and any approved growth).    This would providea very small margin to help those few Departments which will be inexceptionally acute difficulty next year.THE NEXT STEPS12. I propose that all colleagues should now review their plans with aview to increasing their savings and adjusting the timing of them to ensurethat we reduce numbers to 675, 000 by April 1982.    By October, we needto be able to confirm the April 1982 figure and, if at all possible, to seeour way clearly to reaching the April 1984 target.    Both the Treasury andCivil Service Committee and the unions will expect to be told our plans.13. I propose therefore that I should report to Cabinet again at the endof October.    To present a clear plan, I shall need firm details ofcolleagues&apos; revised savings and their timing by 1 October at the latest.14. Some Departments have included proposals in the Public ExpenditureSurvey which would affect staff numbers.    It is essential that we allowadditions only where it is absolutely clear that there is no alternative.I list the relevant proposals and my recommendations on them in Annex B.ACHIEVING GREATER EFFICIENCY15. Meanwhile we are studying a wide variety of issues including range-pay for senior grades, merit pay in place of automatic increments,promotion and succession policies and the scope for shortening the chainof command.    These will not themselves produce large reductions inmanpower but should help to encourage efficiency.    I will not trouble my3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcolleagues with them now but will report further in the autumn. Inaddition colleagues&apos; agreement is being sought by correspondence to moreflexible arrangements for early retirement along the lines which officialsbelieve will meet Departments&apos; needs.16. We need also, as agreed at Cabinet on 1 May, to ensure thatmanagement experience and best management practices (including the useof management information systems) are more effectively disseminatedand practised.    This too is very much tied up with some of Sir DerekRayner&apos;s &quot;lasting reforms&quot; proposals and he and I expect te be able tereport on these important issues towards the end of the year.CONCLUSIONS17. I invite my colleagues to agree that:-a.      we should for the present continue to plan for acontingency margin of 10, 000 posts;bc      all Departments, other than those employing prisonstaff and a very few other exceptional cases should aim tomake new savings by April 1984, in addition to the plansalready announced, equal to 10 per cent of their staff in postat 1 April 1980, and should revise their present plansaccordingly;c. we should aim to reduce numbers to 675, 000 by 1 April 1982,and all Departments should plan to reduce their staff by that dateas proposed in paragraph 11;d. the new proposals in the Public Expenditure Survey shouldbe dealt with as proposed in Annex B;e. The Civil Service Department, with the help and adviceof Sir Derek Rayner as appropriate, should discuss withDepartments:-i.      any necessary clarification of the savings alreadyunder consideration and their timing, together withsimilar information about proposed further savings;ii.      the prospects of each Department for 1981-82;iii.      the scope for further scrutinies and other measuresu      to improve efficiency.f. colleagues should provide me with the necessary figures notlater than 1 October so that I can report again to Cabinet at the endof October with firm proposals for staffing numbers in eachDepartment at 1 April 1982 and 1 April 1984., , SCivil Service Department18 July 1980 4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALANNEX ASUMMARY OP &quot;NEW&quot; SAVINGS PROPOSED BY DEPARTMENTSThe replies to the Lord President&apos;s letter of 4 June vary in theextent to which firm commitments are made to additional savingsof a particular size.    In some cases, provisos have been made  Iglabout the possibility of achieving the savings indicated;    and inother cases the savings shown may be exceeded.     The following tablegives the best assessment that can be made at this stage of thelikely level of savings arising from the proposals which have beenput forward.     It has not been possible to clear the content of thetable with departments and we cannot be sure that the individualentries reflect accurately departments&apos; intentions.     But we arereasonably satisfied that the returns point to an overall totalsomewhat in excess of 40,000.Department Source of Proposed New Savings   Number ofproposed newsavings by^April 1984Def enc e (includ ingRoyal OrdnanceFactories)Follow-up to Dockyard, R&amp;D andSupply Management studies.Possible simplification andstreamlining of procurement,stocktaking, inspection etc.Possible contracting out (navalPOL depots, cataloguing,repair etc) and privatisation(ROPs, Defence Sales, researchareas etc).
