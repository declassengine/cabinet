CONFIDENTIALENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 35 COPY NO 82I July 1980CABINETTHE ECONOMIC PROSPECTMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. Our strategy for th3 medium term was set out in the Budget. Therehave been detailed criticisms of the realism of particular elements in thatstrategy, for example the size of the assumed turn-round in the finances ofthe nationalised industries, but its essence has not been seriously challenged.No-one has produced an alternative that would offer a better prospect for thedifficult period that face3 us.    Indeed, all the suggested alternatives wouldcarry high risks of greater inflation and greater loss of output and employmentin the longer term.    This is a good opportunity on which to take stock of theeconomy, and in particular to see how far its current course differs from ourearlier expectations.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS2. The forecasts made before the Budget saw the economy moving intorecession in 1980, with gross domestic product falling bv about 2j per cent,and inflation peaking about the middle of the year and then gradually declining.Activity in fact remained rather stronger in the early months of the year thanhad been expected.    But there are now clear signs that output is falling.Though the figures for recent months are distorted by the effects of the steelstrike they do not suggest that that fall is faster than had been expected.Similarly, the 240, 000 rise in unemployment in the past six months is in linewith the Budget-time forecast.    Rising labour costs and squeezed profitmargins have been a major factor behind the 3$ per cent fall in employment inmanufacturing over the past yet r.    Since output has been little changed overmost of this period this suggests some improvement in productivity, in con-trast with the experience in 1975 when the recession was accompanied by flator falling productivity.3. In two important respects, however, recent experience has been worsethan expected.    First, pay increases have been significantly bigger than we hadhoped.   Second, though, following the action we took last November, thegrowth of money supply has been reduced, it is proving more difficult thanexpected to hold it within the guidelines.    This is partly becaust industry&apos;s1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALdemands for credit have remained very high but also because public spendingin cash terms has been rising more rapidly in recent months than we hadexpected.    The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) in 1979-80 cameout significantly higher than estimated at Budget time, because of Increasedlocal authority borrowing.    The central Government&apos;s borrowing requirementin the first two months of the current financial year has been increased byhigher than expected spending on cash-limited supply expenditure.INFLATION4. The economic prospect is dominated by the problem of inflation.Over the past tv/o years the rate of inflation in the Organisation for EconomicCo-operation and Development (OECD) area as a whole has almost doubled,from about 8 per cent to 14 per cent.    The doubling of the world oil price has,played a significant part in this.    In Britain, following the rapid monetaryexpansion between mid-1977 and mid-1979, the inflation rate has also doubled.Part of this acceleration was due to special, once-for-all factors, such asthe backlash effect from the Labour Government&apos;s attempts to hold down pay,the switch from income tax to Value Added Tax and the necessary adjustmentof nationalised industry prices and local authority rents, but pay increaseshave been disappointingly high.WORLD ENVIRONMENT5. Though industrial activity in most of the main economies had beenstronger than had been expected at the beginning of the year, the tempo nowshows signs of slackening.    Led by America, OECD output is likely to fallover the next 12 months.    The general expectation is that the world recessionas severe as that of 1974-75.    Most countries seem to have adjustedmore smoothly to the oil price rise on this occasion.    They appear to havelearnt the lesson chat the right response is not fiscal expansion.    Stock levelshave been kept under tighter control and wage-earners in OECD as a whole -though not Britain - appear to have accepted that the higher oil price entails areduction in real earnings.6. But while there is good reason to expect that the world recession willbe shallower than in 1974-75, there are also grounds for thinking that therecovery from it will be weaker than in 1976.    The international environmentin which Britain&apos;s economy has to earn its living is therefore likely over thenext few years to be one of relatively slow growth and rising unemployment.The unemployment rate in the United States and Canada is now nearly 8 percent.    Unemployment, on a comparable basis of measurement, is also abovethat in Britain in some other countries, including Italy and probably France.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PROSPECT FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM ECONOMY7. In Britain, since the recession started rather later thaa expected, thefall in output this year could be slightly smaller than the 2j per cent forecastat Budget time; but oy the same token output in 1981 now looks like falling bymore than the 1 per cent forecast earlier.8. While there i3 general agreement among forecasters that the economyis moving into recession there are differences of view about its likely depthand duration.    These stem in particular from a divergence of view aboutBritain&apos;s trading performance, and especially about the consequences of theserious loss of cost competitiveness suffered over the past three years as aresult of rapidly rising pay, poor productivity and an appreciating exchangerate.    The Treasury&apos;s latest forecast assumes that part of our poor tradingperformance in 1979 was attributable to a relatively high pressure of demandat home: it is therefore thought that in the coming year the effects of the lossof competitiveness may be considerablv offset by the fall in domestic spending.If we were to attach more weight to weaker competitiveness there would be aserious loss of export business and continued rapid import penetration incoming years.    It is not easy to reach a conclusion as between these twoviews, and their implications for the United Kingdom economy over the nextfew years could be markedly different.9. The recent forecast gives a prospect broadly similar in its generalfeatures to that presented in the Budget, but as the recession started ratherlater than expected more of the decline in investment, stocks and output iscarried into 1981.    With the completion of the run-down in capital spendingand stocks, output growth should resume in 1982, and rise further in 1983, asinflation comes down and the world economy recovers.    The levels of grossdomestic product in those later years are not significantly different from thoseassumed in the medium-term financial strategy (MTFS) projections. However,because less of the recession occurs in 1980 and more in 1981 the growth rateover the three years 1981, 1982 and 1983 taken as a whole may fall short of the1 per cent average assumed in the MTFS projections.    Real earnings, whichhave increased at a totally unsustainable rate in the past two years, could fallif earnings decelerate ahead of prices.    This would ease slightly the severesqueeze on profits.    Even so, the company sector may remain in substantialfinancial deficit through this period.    Unemployment is expected to risesteeply, and to exceed the level of 1.8 million assumed in the publicexpenditure survey by autumn 1981.    Inflation is forecast to decelerate throughthe period from its present high level, but not as quickly as we had hoped.10. The MTFS projections of public finances are affected not o*ly by theworsened outlook for output and inflation in 1981 but also by particular changesto public expenditure and revenue.    The most important of these are thesmaller contributions to the European Community budget and the lower fore-casts of North Sea oil output - amounting to a reduction of over 5 milliontonnes, or more than 5 per cent, in some years.    Though the effects on North3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSea tax receipts of these lower oil volumes is to some extent offset by thehigher oil price, there is still a significant loss of revenue.    The net effectof all these changes is to worsen the budgetary prospect for 1991-82 but toleave the prospects for the public finances in (he later years close to theprojections presented at Budget time.    Thus after a tight budgetary positionin 1981-82 there should be in the later years some scope for tax reductionsconsistent with the overriding objective of bringing down the growth of moneysupply and inflation.11. The latest view of the medium-term prospects is thus broadly similarto the one I presented in the Budget, but recent developments - particularly thehigh level of pay settlements - have substantially increased the risks of a moreadverse outcome.    If the loss of competitiveness hits our external trade moreseverely than the forecasts assume the recession could be deeper and moreprotracted and the financial difficulties of the company sector more acute.CONCLUSION12. The course of the economy in recent months has not been substantiallydifferent from earlier expectations; if anything, inflationary pressures so farthis year have remained rather stronger than expected, but there have beenincreasing signs of contrary pressures from the developing recession.    It willbe far from easy to contain the PSBR and reduce monetary growth in 1981-82,but in the present delicately poised situation it is more than ever imperative tohold to our strategy.    The next two years are bound to be painful and difficultones.   But it is only by bringing about the needed adjustments in the economyin that period that we can create the conditions for sound and sustainable growthin the medium term.G HTreasury Chambers30 19804CONFIDENTIAL
