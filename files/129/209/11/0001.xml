CONFIDENTIALMF.NT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 36 COPY NO 821 July 1980CABINETINTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE CENTREMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Environment1. The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy have recently con-sidered a proposal by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and myselffor a new Government Conference Centre to meet our Commonwealth andEuropean Community (EC) obligations in the middle 1980s.    Following thatdiscussion I was asked to consider alternatives to continuing with the projecton the Broad Sanctuary site and the future use of the Broad Sanctuary site ifwe abandoned the Conference Centre project.2. Only on Broad Sanctuary can we provide the full range of facilities formajor international conferences, and meet the security and trafficconsiderations, in time for the EC Presidency in 1987.    I have looked into thepossibility of adapting Somerset House (a Grade I listed building) or modifyingthe project to rebuild Richmond Terrace to provide a Conference Centre thereBoth projects would cost more and take longer than the Broad Sanctuaryscheme; and at Richmond Terrace the requirement could not be met in full(brief details in annex).    I know of no other building in London suitable andavailable for adaptation.    A search for other sites, available and meeting thecriteria, within three miles radius of Whitehall has also drawn a blank.3. A temporary solution providing minimal facilities would be costly andnot solve our long-term problem.    The growth in requirements (especiallyinterpretation facilities) means that Lancaster House is no longer a feasiblesolution.    We would need to provide temporary buildings (perhaps in theForeign Office courtyard or or Horse Guards Parade) and make use ofsurrounding offices.    The feasibility of these solutions has not beenexamined in detail; but they would certainly cost several million pounds.Adapting the Lancaster House complex for the 1977 series of conferences cost 2 million at 1977 prices.4. If we abandon Broad Sanctuary as a site for the Conference Centre, wecould consider:1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALa. Leasing it for the construction of Government offices.    I do notrecommend this course; switching civil servants fTom one leasedbuilding to another will not save us money.b. Grassing over Broad Sanctuary to turn it into a park.    This isneither a simple nor a cheap option.    There are secure telephoneexchanges and other installations below the surface, which we cannotdispense with.    Simply landscaping the site would cost about 7 million, but measures to keep the exchange operational (secureaccess, ventilation, means of escape) would add  1 million to this.Providing at the same time for the Parliamentary telephone exchangeextension would cost a further  2$ million.    Complete removal of allinstallations to another site - a prerequisite of commercial develop-ment - would be even more expensive.c. Selling it for private development. &apos;  Z do not consider thisappropriate on this site.5. The Broad Sanctuary design has been approved by the local planningauthority and the Royal Fine Art Commission.    A public exhibition attractedno adverse comment.    Planning is well advanced and construction of thediaphragm wall surrounding the site began under the previous Administration.6. The site has remained a conspicuous eyesore in the heart of Londonfor 30 years.    At this stage I need to start building the substructure; privatesector finance for the superstructure, which is not due to start constructionuntil 1982, is something that I will explore further.    But I have covered theprovision of sums for this project within my Public Expenditure SurveyCommittee budget.7. The Home Secretary has looked at traffic and security implications.Wherever we put it, a Conference Centre will generate traffic. ParliamentSquare is already heavily congested, and a Conference Centre at BroadSanctuary would be likely to add to this problem.    The local authorities arein consultation with the police on how to handle the traffic consequences of aConference Centre here.8. A Conference Centre sited anywhere in central London would presentsignificant security, public orier as well as traffic problems, and consequen-tial demands on police resources.    The security authorities who have beenconsulted during the development of the proposal are agreed that a purpose-built, detached building on the Broad Sanctuary site would present fewersecurity problems than other sites in the centre of London which have so farbeen suggested (Somerset House and Richmond Terrace).     There may bepublic order problems at the site, partly because of its proximity to thePalace of Westminster, but similar problems might occur at any centralLondon site.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL9.       If colleagues accept that we need proper conference facilities to meetour international obligations, particularly towards the Commonwealth and EC,in the middle 1980s and beyond, my view is that the Broad Sanctuary site offersthe only practicable solution.M HDepartment of the Environment1 July 19803CONFIDENTIAL
