CONFIDENTIALCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 3120 June 1980COPY NO82CABINETTHE GOVERNMENT OF NORTHERN IRELAND: PROPOSALSFOR FURTHER DISCUSSIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland1. The Conference on the Government of Northern Ireland, which washeld in Stormont from 7 January to 24 March, adjourned so thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government could prepare proposals for further discussionwith the political parties in Northern Ireland regarding the future governmentof Northern Ireland: I now attach for approval by the Cabinet a draftdocument for publication setting out the Government proposals.2. Publication of this document constitutes the next stage ofdevelopment of our policy described in The Queen&apos;s Speech as:&quot;to seek an acceptable way of restoring to the people ofNorthern Ireland more control over their own affairs. &quot;The policy embodied in the draft document is to seek an &quot;acceptable way&quot;between the opposed objectives of the two communities in Northern Irelandthrough mechanisms of government that effectively assure bothcommunities a share in the exercise of power and decision talcing.Part in of the draft document sets out two alternative approaches(summarised in paragraph 3. 42) to that central issue, each with theobject of sharing power between representatives of the two communities.The first approach would give any party represented in the electedAssembly, and winning a certain proportion of the popular vote, a seat orseats on the Executive.    The second approach, while not guaranteeingseats on the Executive to the minority, would balance the power of theExecutive against that of a Council of the Assembly on which minorityrepresentatives, though constituting the Opposition, would have aprominent place.3. Following preliminary examination by a group of Ministers underthe chairmanship of the Home Secretary (ML3C 24) an earlier version of thedraft was considered by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee (OD) onCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL10 June.   The Committee, while recognising the numerous difficulties inthe way of attaining our Objective, took the view on balance that theproposals represented the best basis oh which tb conduct the furtherdiscussions.4. The Committee expressed concern on two aspects of the draftingof the document.    The first was that its tone was negative in relation tothe continuing position oi Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom.Detailed amendment of paragraphs 2.10 to 15 of the draft has I believeremoved any ground for misapprehension on that score, while retaining thereassurances which the minority community will need regarding thelegitimacy of their long-term aspirations and the need for close Anglo-Irishrelationships.5. Second, the OD Committee stressed the need to consider the textof the paper carefully in relation to possible implications for Scotland.With this aspect in mind I have revised various passages in Parts II and III,in consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland, and I believe thereie no continuing cause for concern on this score.   Almost any proposalsfor devolution of power in Northern Ireland can be seen by those who lookfor them as offering precedents for Scotland; but I believe that it issufficiently well understood that Northern Ireland is in a different categoryfrom the rest of the United Kingdom.6. The point was also made in discussion at OD that if the proposalsin the draft document were accepted it would be necessary to reconsiderthe level of Northern Irish representation at Westminster. Accordinglythe revised draft includes (paragraph 3. 39) a passage drawing attentionto this point.    However, I believe it would be a serious mistake to includeany such passage in the published document.   It would to my mindseriously jeopardise the reception of the proposals.    The reaction of theLabour Opposition would be strongly hostile and it could put at riskbipartisan policy towards Northern Ireland.    Some leading Official Unionistswould use it as an argument for ooposing the proposals on the ground thattheir preference was for the higher level of representation at Westminster.Other Unionists, including these in Dr Paisley&apos;s Democratic Unionist Party,would see it as undermining proposals which the Government had beenurging them to take seriously; and their anxieties on this score would becompounded if, ao is likely, r. hint of reduced Northern Ireland representationat Westminster was welcomed by representatives of the minoritycommunity, and by opinion in the Republic of Ireland, as an indication ofthe loosening rather than the strengthening of ties between Northern Irelandand Great Britain.    For all these reasons my recommendation to theCabinet is that, at this stage in the development of our policy, the questionof Northern Ireland representation at Westminster should not be publiclyreopened.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL7. As regards timing, I recommend publication as soon as possible -probably on Tuesday 1 July.    Early publication will satisfy the expectationthat now exists and end speculation regarding the Government&apos;s proposals.It will make possible an early Parliamentary debate linked with the Motionto approve the extension of direct rule in Northern Ireland, which must bepassed before 16 July.    This arrangement is not in all respects ideal. Weare now approaching the Northern Ireland &quot;marching season&quot; during whichthere is an increased risk of extreme partisan reaction from NorthernIreland politicians.    We should need to do all that we can, at and after thetime of the publication, to counteract that risk.    If, however, we delaypublication until that period, and the Northern Ireland and Great Britainholiday seasons, are over, we risk a loss of political momentum as wellas losing valuable weeks that we need for finalising our proposals andpreparing the necessary legislation.8. I invite my colleaguesi. to approve the draft document, subject to any furtherminor drafting amendments;ii. to agree to its early publication, probably on Tuesday1 July.H ANorthern Ireland Office20 June 19803CONFIDENTIAL
ANNEXPROPOSALS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSIONT. INTRODUCTION1.1 In this Document HKG sets out proposals for thegovernment of Northern Ireland in the light of recentdiscussions, in particular at the Conference of NorthernIreland political parties earlier this year, to &quot;which detailedreference is made below*   The Government would hope, followingfurther discussion and consultation with all the parties, toput forward specific proposals for legislation in the nextsession of Parliament.       &apos;ijv / s1.2 As a first step towards the development of these proposalsthe Government announced in October 1979 its intention toconvene a Conference of representatives of the four mainpolitical parties in Northern Ireland - the Alliance Party,Social Democratic and Labour Party, Ulster Democratic UnionistParty, and Ulster Unionist Party ( who did not accept theinvitation but instead submitted a paper to HMG setting outtheir considered views ).   To prepare the ground for thisConference the Government published in November 1979, aWorking Paper (Cmnd 7763) which set out the principles withinwhich, in HKGfs view, new arrangements should be sought, andput forward for discussion a number of possible approaches to,and illustrative models of, new governmental arrangements.1*3   The princvolps set out in the Wo^kirc p-^r&gt;v u,^**- f tr* * * * - -u^.&apos;-*.   e   fci^w   wmw   J.**   w.ic      v* ^11*5   ISpur   Wdl c 1&quot;(A)   The powers should be transferred to electedrepresentatives of the people of northern Irelard aridthe overriding authority of Parli s:r.ent &quot;will (Sb.&quot;Where in the United Kingdom) be preserved;- 1 -
(ii)   In the words of the Statement cf 25 October*,there will have to be &quot;reasonable and appropriatearrangements to take account of the interests ofthe minorityV.   Those arrangements will have to beacceptable to both sides of the conusunity and alsoto Her Majesty&apos;s Government.   The political divisionsof the people of Northern Ireland are such that thealternation of the parties in government which is soimportant a feature of the Westminster system isunlikely to take place.   In the Government&apos;s viewit is essential for a transfer of powers to be rr.adein a way which will take account of the interestsof both parts of the community.(iii)   Under any new arrangements, existing safeguards andremedies against discrimination on religious orpolitical grounds should be at least maintained,and, if possible, improved.(iv)   Responsibility for defence and foreign affairs(including relations with the European Community)will remain with the United Kingdom Government andParliament, as will responsibility for the courtsand electoral matters.(v) .In the foreseeable future, given the Government&apos;s overriding commitment to combat terrorism,responsibility for law and order will also remainwith Westminster.(vi)   The generai power to raise revenue by taxation willremain with Westminster;   but this would not ruleout the possibility of a local power to levy a rate.(vii)   Public expenditure in Northern Ireland will continueas at present to be assessed on the basis of need,and to be financed with support as necessary fromthe United Kingdom Exchequer.&quot; ,1.4  The Conference met in Parliament Buildings at Stormontunder the Chairmanship of the Secretary of State for* 34 half-daysessions between 7 January and 24 March;   it then agreed toadjourn in order to allow the Government to prepare proposalsfor further discussion in the light of the Conference. TheConference began with submissions in which the three partyleaders in turn set out their views on the question of thefuture government of Northern Ireland.   Those submissions werepublished by the parties.   Thereafter the Conference workedthrough s:h c-genda based on the questions listed on page 11* Statement by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in theHouse of Commons on 25 October 197.9 renouncing the Government&apos;sintention to convene a conference of the principal politicalparties in Northern Ireland (Official Report, Cols 625-G).
of the Working Paper.1.5 The Secretary of State has also had separate but paralleldiscussions with some of the Northern Ireland politicalparties on matters outside, hut relevant to, the subjectmatter of the Conference.   These talks enabled the partieswho took part in them to inform the Secretary of State, andthrough him the Government, of their views on security andeconomic (including EEC) issues.1.6 The Conference had the merit of bringing together, forthe first time for some years, leading members of all hutone of the main Northern Ireland political parties for detailedand sustained discussion of the problems in establishing a newadministration in Northern Ireland.   These exchanges were ofvalue to the Government and, we believe, to the parties. Theydid not lead to a negotiated agreement for a future pattern ofgovernment.   That was never expected:   the Conference was aimedat establishing the highest level of agreement between the partiesrather than identifying a single detailed scheme of government towhich all would subscribe.   But the parties made clearer to oneanother, and to EMG, where they stand on the various issuesthat arise, what would be acceptable to them, and what would not.1.7 Part II of this Document outlines certain importantconsiderations which in HMG&apos;s view should influence the formof any new arrangements.   Part III sets out, in the lightof the conclusions which HMG has drawn from the Conference,its proposals for further discussion.
II   NEW ARRAlvTGE&gt;EKTS:    THE V.&apos;IDSR CONTEXT2.1 The needs of the people of Northern Ireland, which godeeper than any particular set of political institutions,are: * eace, in particular from terrorist violence; andrec one il i a t i on:stability, in the sense of a settled framework ofgovernment, to provide a base foreconomic reconstruction*2.2 These needs interlock.   One shortcoming can reinforceanother;   and conversely progress in one direction enhancesthe prospects for overall advance.   Any new arrangements mustrecognise that the need to counter terrorism and  the need forecbnstruction&apos;in Northern Ireland are matters of overriding concernto the people of Northern Ireland, and that each interactswith the need for political advance. *&quot;..The Security Background ^2.3 It is HMG&apos;s policy to combat terrorism within the frameworkof the law, with the lead taken by the police, and the Army ina vital but supporting role.    In recent years the securityforces have achieved considerable success against terroriste,but it is apparent that much remains to be done.2.4 The security situation has a direct bearing on one aspectof any new arrangements for the government of northern Ireland.The involvement of the UK Government in the fight againstterrorism - in terms of manpower, equipment and installatjor,~
- D -and their operational use - is such that it is not realisticto envisage conferring on a Northern Ireland administrationfull responsibility for the criminal lav   and the police andprison services.   Equally, that administration should notconduct its business either isolated or excluded from theconcern for security,which is pervasive.   The locally electedrepresentatives responsible for important provincial servicestherefore need to have a sense of identification with theforces of lav and order and to be able to discuss securitymatters with the Secretary of State, who vill retainresponsibility for them.   Arrangements vill thus he needed togive those representatives a voice in security matters whilethe responsibility remains2 as it must for the present, vith HMG*The Financial and Economic Background2.5 The social and economic difficulties of Northern Irelandare already recognised by the Government*   Public expenditureper head is 35 per cent above that in Great Britain, placing| considerable and rising cost on the taxpayer.   In 1979/80public spending in Northern Ireland vas some  2,600 m., of whichonly about 56 per cent vas financed from local sources.2.6 There are implications here for the form of nev arraugmentsfor government in Northern Ireland.   There is as yet no prospectof a Northern Ireland administration self-sufficient infinancial resources.   A nev administration in Northern Irelandvill have to be involved in deciding hov best the publicfunds available to Northern Ireland shall be spent. Atthe same time the Secretary of State will continue toplay a prominent part in determining Northern
Irelandrs share of UK resources.     The precise relationshipwith the Secretary of State will be determined by such factors as whetheror not spending on transferred matters is to be funded bya block grant from Westminster;   whether such a grant shouldcover those services administered on the basis of strictparity with Great Britain;   and by the kind of guidelinesor controls that would be required over the administration&apos;sspending or resource allocation.Reconciliation and Stability2.7 To underpin peace, reconciliation and reconstruction,Northern Ireland needs workable and stable politicalinstitutions*   For over a decade now the province hassuffered uncertainty about the future*   For much of that timeit has been administered by a temporary system of &quot;direct rule&quot;from Westminster, which has made the Secretary of State directlyresponsible for virtually all the functions   commonly exercised by bothcentral and localgovernment.   Though &quot;direct rule&quot; has performed a vital task overthe past 8 years and has achieved general acceptance in theprovince, it leaves no incentive for people in Northern Irelandto seek responsibility through politics and generally stifles&quot;local political initiative*   Moreover for a part of the UK whichhas had a recent tradition of its own legislature and separateadministration linked to it, it is only second best and not apermanent answer*2.8 - The key to stability in Northern Ireland is the healingof the divisions between the two communities.   New institutionsof government which the minority conmmnity cannot accept as itsinstitutions will not bring stability and so will not be worthhaving.   It must therefore be in the interests of the majoritycommunity, desiring as it does stability and. the fruits that this
7can bring, to accept institutions that offer opportunities of participationto the minority.     Equally it must &quot;be in the interests of the minorityconanunity, given institutions vhicb afford its members opportunities ofparticipation and safeguards against discrimination, to join wholeheartedlyin making those institutions work.2.9 What Her Majesty&apos;s Government can do in this is limited.     It cancreate, with the help of representatives of the two communities, fair andworkable institutions.     But governments cannot create the will to make theinstitutions work:   that will to work together must come from the people of[Northern Ireland themselves.     In asking themselves whether they are preparedto make that effort, they should weigh carefully all that is at stake.2.10 Political stability in Northern Ireland has in the past been impairedby the difference in view among many members of the two communities regardingthe long-term future of Northern Ireland:   whether the link with the.United Kingdom should he preserved or the Province be united with theRepublic of Ireland. 2.11 In accordance with section 1 of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 19&lt;&apos;9northern Ireland remains part of Her Majesty&apos;s dominions and of the United Kingdom and in no event will Northern Ireland or any part of it ceaseto be part of the United Kingdom without the consent of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland.     The principle of consent is the only possible framework within which both those who wish to maintain Northern Ireland&apos;s* present status within the United Kingdom and those who aspire to Irish unity arj pursue their own objectives bv legitimate and peaceful means.
- 8-34Statutory provision exists for the wishes of the NorthernIreland electorate to be tested at intervals by a &quot;borderpoll&quot; 9 and successive Governments have made it clear thatthose wishes, whether to remain part of the UK or to ceaseso to he, vill he respected.   A substantial majority of thepeople of Northern Ireland at present wish it to :^remain part of the UK.2.12 It follows that the continued position of NorthernIreland within the United Kingdom is not something which theGovernment could use as a bargaining counter in order to secure,agreement to a particular form of political institution. Nevarrangements for transferring some responsibility to the peopleof Northern Ireland for the conduct of their own affairs mustbe sought on the basis of the shared interest of bothcommunities in developing a stable, peaceful and prosperouscountry.2.13 Thus the development of new political arrangements inNorthern Ireland must rest on these foundations:   the majority communityshould be confident that Northern Ireland cannot be separatedfrom the rest of the United Kingdom without the consent of amajority of its people:   the minority community shouldaccept and respect that fact;   and in response the majorityshould ensure a positive-role for the minority community inarrangements for the government of Northern Ireland.   And it isin the interests of both communities to recognise and developthe links that exist between Northern Ireland and the Republic ofIreland.2.14 In the words of the communique issued after the meeting on21 May between the Prime_Mi.nistex.,and ..the Taoiseach, there is aaw
unique relationship between the peoples of the United Kingdomof Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic ofIreland, and a need to further this relationship in theinterests of peace and reconciliation*   We share bonds ofhistory, culture and language;   there is a mutual economic andtrading interest, enhanced by our common membership of theEuropean Community;   and there is a close geographical inter-relationship, recognised in the existence of a common travelarea and illustrated by many centuries of the movement of peopleand of trade across the Irish Sea.   The ties between us are close.And with those ties comes a mutuality of interest.   Each territoryis inescapably affected by events and developments in the other&quot;.2.15 Division and dissent in Northern Ireland put all theserelationships between the United Kingdom and the Republic ofIreland under strain.   New arrangements for the government ofNorthern Ireland which secured the support of both communitiesfor a system in which both communities fully participated wouldbenefit us all and encourage the growth of a new and deeperrelationship between the United Kingdom of Great Britain andNorthern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.CQNBDEHBBL:.&quot;
- 10 -III   PROPOSALS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION3.1 In this part of the Document the Government sets out injdetail proposals for transferring to locally elected representativessome of the powers of government now exercised from Westminsterunder the arrangements for direct rule.   The proposals are summarisedin paragraphs 3.^0-42.3.2 In a number of respects it is possible, in the light of theConference and other discussions since the Working Paper waspublished, to see a form of locally elected administration whichwould meet the exceptional circumstances of Northern Ireland. Butas regards one crucial issue - how provision should be made for theparticipation in government of representatives of the minoritycommunity - the way ahead is not clear: and on this aspect rests theacceptability of any scheme as a whole.   The features which would beappropriate whatever the arrangements made for the participation ofhe minority community - the outer framework - are described inaragraphs 3*3 to 3.13*   The options which might meet the requirements regards the participation of the minority community are describedun paragraphs 3 1^ et seq.he Outer Framework  3 First, there should be a transfer of powers of government innorthern Ireland to an administration based on a single province-widejlected Assembly.   The desire for a transfer of powers comparable inicope (though not necessarily identical in detailed arrangement)rith the 1920 and 1973 constitutions is widely expressed. Thereras general opposition among the parties who took part in thelonference to a transfer of powers and functions on the lines ofjocal government in Great Britain.
- 11 -The creation of more than one sub-provincial assembly wouldentail expense, disruption and confusion.   Northern Irelandcan and should be regarded for governmental purposes abovethe level of the district councils as a single entity* *The restructuring of local government consequent upon theReport of the Review Body on Local Government in NorthernIreland 1970 (the Kacrory Report) took place in 1973.   It wasan inherent part of the post-Kacrory structure that a NorthernIreland Asisembly would constitute a single top tier authorityof democratic scrutiny and control of services to be managedhenceforth on a province-wide basis.   Local differences andneeds can be catered for where appropriate by specialarrangements in the administration of particular services.As regards the size of a provincial Assembly, past experiencein NI and the needs of adequate representation suggest that itcould appropriately contain about 80 members* g||3.4  Second, in the light of the special political considerationthat apply in Northern Ireland, the method of election to theAssembly should be the single transferable vote form ofproportional representation.   This method is familiar and well-established in Northern Ireland, having been used since 1973 forall elections except those to Westminster.   There is nosufficient reason to depart from it now.-  . -.     \  3.5&apos; Third: a new Assembly and the Executive body derived fromit should have responsibility over a ranrre of subjects bropdlvsimilar to that transferred. 3r. 1975 (ie principally agriculture,commerce, education, employment, environmental matters includinghousing, health and social services) although there might be a
need for some changes to take account of subsequent aevelopr.eri *s.A transfer on this scale would enable the existing administrativemachinery of the Northern Ireland Departments now under the direccontrol of the Secretary of State to come under the control ofthe new body, which would thus be able to make a concerted effortto tackle the distinctive problems afflicting the provinceafter years of unrest,3.6   Fourth, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland wouldcontinue to be wholly accountable to Parliament at Westminsterfor the responsibilities and functions which he will&apos;&quot;continueto exercise.   These would be those reserved and excepted matters,notably law and order, for which he would be directly responsibleand the consideration of the total Northern Ireland publicexpenditure requirement, in consultation with members of theNorthern Ireland Executive and in the context of United Kingdomexpenditure programmes.   The Secretary of State would need meansto ensure that actions of the administration in the transferredfield did not Jeopardise the exercise of the Government&apos;sresponsibilities in the reserved or excepted fields (eg toensure that the UK&apos;s international obligations were observed).
HIM- 13 -5.7  Fifth, the Secretary of State would convene under hisChairmanship representative leading members of the Assemblyas an advisory council for consultation on those mattersfor vhich he will remain ministerially responsible andaccountable to Parliament.3.8   Sixth, the Assembly should have pover as in 1974 tolegislate on transferred matters.   The political parties in /Northern Ireland have expressed a desire for legislativepowers to be exercised again locally rather than at Westminster.Past tradition and practice and present needs point in thedirection of transferring legislative power.   From 1921 to 1972(and again during the short life of the   1974   NI Executive)there was a separate legislature at Stormont.   For the past- eightyears the practice of separate NI legislation has been maintainedthrough an Order in Council procedure precisely sto.enable a local legislature to resume the function as soonthere Is overas devolved government was restored; and J - :Tf*?&apos; a wide range ofsubject-matter there is a separate corpus of statute law forNI.
- 14 -3.9 Moreover the existing administrative institutions inNT are designed to service a local system of governmentvith corresponding legislative powers.   For all these reasonsthe Government concludes that it would be appropriate to conferlegislative as well as executive powers on a NI Assembly.3.10 Seventh, the executive direction of the Northern IrelandDepartments would be the responsibility of individual membersof the Assembly, acting as Heads of the Northern IrelandDepartments.   (The form of the Executive, comprising the -/individual Heads of Departments and the Chief Executive,is considered in paras 3.14 et seq).3.11 Eighth, there should be Departmental Committees of theAssembly.      Irrespective of the form which the Executivemay take, there will be an important role for Committeesformed of elected representatives of all significant partiesto scrutinise the   actions of the Executive and offer adviceto the administration.     The powers of the Committees, whichcould between them cover all the NI Departments, couldinclude:   calling for papers and persons; scrutinisingDepartmental policy including the Departmental estimates;holding hearings on proposed legislation;   and taking thecommittee stage of measures not taken on the floor of the Assembly.They might also have allotted time in the Assembly for debating their
cvra proposals for legislation. Their Chairmen   ar:0 p-rc8?sDeputy Chairmen) night be salaried and, together t eaeehers, could   be either proportionately representeeof the Assembly as a whole or equally distributea s-weeenthe parties supporting the Executive and the opP sioionv.The choice would be determined by the method of selectingthe Executive (see paras. 3.14 et seq).3.12 Ninth, the existing safeguards arid remedies againstdiscrimination on religious or political r-ourds shouldbe maintained.   There may in addition need to be some foreof appeal to the Secretary of St ate, or to Westminster, againstdiscriminatory acts on the part of the Assembly* orExecutive. : The form that this might best tele?: woulddepend on the shape of the arrangements adopted for theformation of the executive.3.13 In the nine, aspects outlined above the requirements andinterests of both communities appear to ET&apos;jG to coincide,and moreover to be capable of being accommodated in asystem of efficient and responsive government. The&quot;fourGovernment also believes that the policies cf the/mainparties are broadly compatible with a system containingthese nine features (although there would be differencesof view on some natters of detail) provided that agreementcould be reached on a system of government as a.whole,including the question of formation of the Executive. Itis on this that the differences among the major partiesare most clerkly and significantly displayed, as the followparagraphs ms\ze clear.
How sh oul3 th* Executive he fc^c-d*5    Ol^EIOEf^Xl^L  if*-&apos;5-^ Alliance ?r-rr-   draw attest ion to the fundamentalcocaunity division which they say is at the root of thepolitical problem and can be resolved only by the creationof political institutions based upon the principle ofpartnership*   The Alliance Party say that an administrationdrawn from all substantial elected groupings on theprinciple of proportionality would create politicalstructures which both sections of the community wouldsupport.   At the Conference they made detailed proposalsfor an executive committee system of government based onpr op or t i on al it y  3.15 She SDL? say that the essential requirement is tocreate a political process which will allow mutual confidenceand trust to develop in Northern Ireland,    leading to lastingpeace and stability;   this can only be achieved through aperiod of partnership between the two communities. ..At theConference the SDLP, while not regarding partnershipas a natural end in itself, advocated a Cabinet-typepartnership administration reflecting proportionately the  strength in the Assembly of all parties willing to participatein such an administration.3.16 The ppUP say that if any system is to be acceptable itmust not seek to deny to an elected majority the rightswhich democracy bestows on the majority;   the Executive |.should be formed by that party or group of parties whichhas been placed in the majority in the elected forum.The VDUP accordingly proposed at the Conference a Cabinet-style administration formed by a major it/ grouping in theAssembly.
CONFIDENTIAL Wf\17,17 In their proposals sent to the Prime Minister in December 19791 the UUP\ocated a form of devolved government with a Cabinet system of administrationrmed by the leader of the largest group of members returned to the Assembly*.18 Thus the k parties are far from agreeing on the crucial question howrangements are to be made in a new system of administration for thevolvement of representatives of the minority community.   They will needgnificantly to narrow the difference between them if the Government is toable to introduce in the next session of Parliament legislation whichuld transfer, substantial powers back to elected representatives of theople of Northern Ireland.   The Government is resolved to pursue its effortsfind a basis on which a generally acceptable system could be established,d in this paper offers suggestions for the involvement of the representativesthe minority community for further discussion and negotiation.ovision for Minority Participation3.19 The announcement (25 October 1979) of the Government&apos;s intention toepare proposals for transferring powers of government in Northern Irelandlocally elected representatives spoke of the need for &quot;reasonable andpropriate arrangements to take account of the interest of the minority&quot;.larging on this theme para 5(ii) of the Working Paper said:&quot;Those arrangements will have to be acceptable to both sides of thecommunity and also to Her Majesty&apos;s Government.   The political divisions -of the people of Northern Ireland are such that the alternation of theparties in Government which is so important a feature of the Westminstersystem is unlikely to take place..   In the Government&apos;s view it isessential for a transfer of powers to be made in a way which willtake account of the interests of both parts of the community.&quot;CONFIDENTIAL
- 18 -3.20 Everything said at the Conference, and elsewhere sincethe Government published t^he Working Paper, has confirmed theprime importance of that principle.   Unless the minority communityfeels able to accept, and identify with, the institutions ofgovernment in Northern Ireland, there is little prospect ofpolitical stability in the Province and hopes of peace andprosperity will be impaired*   It is in the interest of themajority community as much as of the minority that the form ofinstitutions adopted should meet that criterion.   The Governmentbelieves that there is a wide measure of agreement among peoplein both communities regarding that objective, though there aredifferences of view expressed in the political parties as to howit can be achieved.   The issue arises essentially in the questionhow the Executive in a new system is formed;   for either theminority gains its involvement through membership of the Executive;or other, equally effective, means have to be devised.3.21 The Westminster model of forming the Executive whichis favoured by some NI parties is the classic form of democracy -majority rule.     It is based on the premise that a majoritycan enforce its will and that a political system should reflectthat reality by institutionalising the   predominance of thewill of the majority.   It is the natural concomitant of the ,development of a political party system in which the partiesreflect and advocate distinct approaches to the matters  eg management of the economy, provision of public services  for which the Executive is responsible.     It favours thedevelopment of a responsible Opposition, challenging the Governmentand ready to take over from it.      The prevailing view is
that this system meets the politic2I needs 0f G3 well , endit is commcn to many political systems .elsewhere in theworld*5.22 The special features of political life in Northern :Ireland mean that application there of the majority rulesystem would be almost certain to put control of theadministration in the hands of representatives of themajority community permanently.   This is not inevitable;in certain circumstances representatives of the minoritycommunity could gain places in the administration - a-partyor parties representing elements in the majority communitymight choose to form a coalition administration withminority representatives*   But given the present basisof political party allegiance in Northern Ireland, thatis an unlikely outcome of any election.    It is far moreprobable that the representatives of the minority communitywould be, as they were betv/een 1921 and 1972, in the., minor itin any elected Assembly with representatives of: the majoritycommunity unwilling to form a coalition with them. Themajority rule system would therefore in practice excludethem from the Executive.3.23 This consequence of applying the Westminster system inthe NI context makes it vital, in HHG&apos;s view, that anyscheme for the government of Northern Ireland should,while retaining the support of the majority community,depart substantially from the Westminster model. Twoalternative approaches to the involvement of the minorityin government are set out below.   Sach ir  intended to
CQWHDENIIeL-   - .  - 20 -secure the responsible participation of the minoritycommunity in the administration of NI,     The first wouldachieve this aim by ensuring that any party representedin the Assembly which won a certain proportion of the *popular vote had a seat or seats in the Executive. Thesecond would achieve the same aim by securing that, whileminority representatives had no guaranteed place in theExecutive, the power of the Executive was balanced againstthat of another institution within the Assembly in whichthe minority, being in Opposition, was assured a prominentplace.3*24    Either of these methods of securing minorityparticipation in government will seem strange judged byconventional Westminster criteria.   But the politicalsituation in Northern Ireland is itself unconventional insome crucial respects    First, there is the absence alreadyreferred to of the normal prospect of alternation of partiesin power;   the likelihood is that the parties representingthe minority community will constitute a permanent politicalminority in permanent opposition.   Next, what chieflydistinguishes the Northern Ireland political parties fromone.another is their attitudes to the question of the constitu-tional status of Northern Ireland - a matter which will be outsidethe competence of a devolved administration.     The range ofresponsibilities likely to be transferred at the outsetto a Northern Ireland administration, though of substantialextent (see para 3 5 above), has not in the past givenrise* to   great ideological differences on socio-economic
- 21 -grounds among the main parties;    and this may well proveto be the future pattern also, especially when account istaken of the extent of Northern Ireland financial dependenceon the UK government and the constraints placed upon thefreedom of action of aNorthern Ireland administrationby the expectations of &apos;parity1 of services.   Indeed, therewill be a strong managerial element in the primary taskof a Northern Ireland executive:   the allocation of resourcesamong contending socio-economic priorities within a totalsum determined by Westminster. These considerations leadHMG to the conclusion that a system of government markedlydifferent from the Westminster model is justified not onlyby the political circumstances of NI but also by referenceto the nature of the task of government.Responsibility Shared within the Executive3.25 The first alternative course to Westminster-stylemajority rule which EMG puts forward is a system whichguarantees any party winning a certain proportion of thepopular vote a seat in the Executive.   Thus a party with,say, 25% of the popular vote would be assured of a quarterof the Executive seats.3.26 There are various ways of providing for an Executivealong these lines to be formed. / One way would be bydirect   &quot;popular election, thus  preserving; the &quot;primacy ofthe Fallot box.   Simultaneously with the election of theAssembly the electorate would, be asked to vote separately(and by a system, of proportional representation pn a province-vide basis) for candidates for the Executive.   Direct electionin this way would ensure that each member of the Executiveowed his place to support in the jor^yj-R.^ as a whole.
CCKflUtNUM.3.27  Another way would be to have a single (PR) election tothe Assembly and then form the Executive bv reference to thestrengths of the &quot;parties elected to the Assembly.     This would not(as did the 1973 Constitution) require any external intervention.Either the Assembly members could elect &quot;the Executive from, theirown midst, using an appropriate mechanism to allocate portfoliosto the successful candidates;   or a simple mathematical formulacould be used to allocate Executive portfolios to those partieswhich obtained a qualifying number of members in the Assembly.In either case faith would be kept with the ballot box, sincethe composition of the Executive would reflect the views of theelectorate who had determined the make-up of the Assembly.3*28  These are means of achieving an Executive in which allsignificant viewpoints are reflected and which, therefore, shouldbe capable of undertaking its tasks with the support of bothcommunities.     The key consideration is this.     If, as HMGis disposed to believe, adoption of a system which &quot;ensured thatthe minority community had places on the Executive would cruciallyaffect the attitude of the minority towards acceptance of thepolitical institutions of Northern Ireland, then that constitutesa powerful reason why the majority community should put asideits misgivings - understandable though these are - and accepta system of a proportionately constituted Executive.     The pri2eto be gained, in terms of the cohesion of Northern Ireland andthe prospects for reconciliation and reconstruction, could be &amp;rich .one.     All sections of opinion in Northern Ireland shouldtherefore consider carefully and with an open mind whether a &quot;proportional system of government would not be the best way tounite both sides of the community in support of new politicalinstitutions.
3.29   That said, KMG must also acknowledge and indeed stressthat no system of this kind could work without the clear supportof the two communities in Northern Ireland, agreeing to itsestablishment and voting in elections for candidates ready toobserve the spirit of reconciliation in a common task. Itcould not be imposed if a majority of the members of thenew Assembly were opposed to the very essence of the system.3.50  The reasons for this are simple.   Any political systembased on democratic lines depends on.the majority ofelected members supporting the existence of the system.For suppose a proportional system were established but a major it6f members in the new Assembly were committed to opposing thatsystem.   Members of the minority parties would, under theconstitution, be entitled to seats on th*e Executive, and totake charge of Northern Ireland Departments.     But they couldbe rendered powerless. 4i* The majority would control the Assemblyand would be in a position to vote down all proposals fromminority members of the Executive.     Indeed in the last resortthe majority might even be able to use their power- to transferall significant functions from the Departments under the controlof the minority   members to those controlled by themselves.3.31  The circumstances described above illustrate the extremeto which matters could    come, if and whenstrains were to develop.     But it is self-evident that anypolitical body is shaped by the will of the majority of its memoFor a system of the kind described above to work, there would&quot;need to be a willingness on the part of the majority to joinin working the system, and a general spirit of give-and-takewithin the Executive.     Otherwise the minority members of theExecutive could find themselves no more than prisoners of theferity.   &gt;^|^gg:|#|fi
Responsibility Shared within the Assemblv3.32 An alternative approach, while not giving the minoritycommunity any guarantee of seats in the Executive, would involvethem in government by some other equally adequate means. Forthe minority community, seats in the Executive have come-toassume a symbolic importance and they are understandablyreluctant to acquiesce in a system which they fear would placetheir representatives in a position of permanent and powerlessopposition in the Assembly.     Nevertheless, HMG believes thatthe holding of Executive seats is not the only way for minorityrepresentatives to participate in and influence the process ofgovernment in both the legislative and executive forms. Genuineopportunities for such participation are provided in the followinvery.different approach to the decision-taking process ingovernment.3.33 The suggestions in the following paragraphs are designedto deal with the situation in which, for lack of agreement on aproportional system, the Executive is to be formed from the party(or parties) commanding a majority in the Assembly, and inconsequence an effective degree of involvement of the minoritymust be guaranteed at other points in the system.3.34 One possibility sometimes mooted would be to require thatthe Chief Executive, when he had appointed the members of his teshould obtain the support not merely of a simple, but of aweighted, majority in the Assembly.     This would oblige him toobtain some support from minority .representatives.     However, ifsuch support could only be obtained at the price of allowing theminority to participate in the Executive, then either stalematewould result (because the majority parties declined to sharepower in that way) or (if the majority parties did agree) theproblem of minority participation in. government would have been
- 25 -solved - in which case the prdpb!rtibfi l Executive system setin paras 3.25 to 3.31 above would probably have been acceptable.Either way this possibility does not appear relevant for thepresent purpose,3.35 The problem is to devise a way in whih, without the minorityparties being represented directly in the Executive, they can,while formally in &quot;opposition&quot;, share responsibility for theadministration sufficiently to satisfy themselves that the interesof the minority community are adequately reflected in the decisionof government.     To achieve this it becomes necessary to create anovel institution in which powers may be vested in order to serve asa balance against/those to be .exercised by the Executive;   but to do so in a waywhich would secure a constructive relationship and avoid deadlock.3.36 It has already been suggested (in paragraph 3.H above)that there should be Departmental Committees of the Assembly witha range of powers.     These Committees would not themselves beappropriate bodies to fulfil the role of the new institution nowneeded; but if the chairmanships and deputy chairmanships ofthose Committees were allocated equally between Assembly membersof those parties supporting the Executive and those -.opposing it(as would be desirable anyway since these Committees would bedesigned to scrutinise critically the activities of the Executiveand the Departments) then those chairmen and deputy chairmencould together form a new body, the Council of the Assembly, witha chairman drawn from its membership but with no additionalvoting power.     Composed in this way it would thus be equallydivided between those Assembly members supporting and opposingthe Executive, and to be effective any proposition on which ithad to decide would have to attract 50?o + 1&apos; votes.GliNFfDptiAl
3.37   The precise powers of the Council of the Asse~b3y are :?crdiscussion.     As-a minimum it would have an advisory role,with the Executive required to consult it on certain occasionsor topics, but with no requirement that the Executive accept thatadvice.     This, however, would not be enough to bring about thatinvolvement of the minority community in the task of governmentwhich is the objective, and if the minority is to possess realinfluence through their presence on it, it would need to have someor all of the following powers:(a) A power whereby the Council could delay legislation(though not Appropriation measures) for a certainperiod.     Though of limited effect, this would focuspublic attention on anything to which the minorityobjected.(b) A power to refer  proposed legislation back to theAssembly, or to refer proposed legislation or executivedecisions, if considered to be discriminatory, to anoutside appeals body of a judicial or political nature(c) A provision requiring that, before being passed by theAssembly, all legislation and the public expenditureprogramme would require the Council!s approval,would give the Council a blocking power (since the 50?omembership of the parties supporting the Executivewould be insufficient to give approval).     It is to behoped that in practice such a power would never be use3.      but that the possibility that it might be used wouldbe sufficient to lead the two sides to an accomnodatioof any issue between them.     However, in order to, ensure that deadlock did not bring government to4an unacceptable halt, this power would have to bemade subject in the last resort to override by.   Order made by the Secretary of State, which couldperhaps be subject to Parliamentary approval at *Minster
3.38 The existence of such a Council would be an incentiveto the Executive to frame and implement its policies byconsultation and discussion among the principal parties inthe Assembly and in the Committees of the Assembly so as tominimize intervention from the Council and avoid confron.tatiorThe members of the Assembly,        those holding office in theExecutive and those holding office in the DepartmentalCommittees, would have an interest in consulting together soas to achieve a high level of accommodation and co-operation.The salaried status of the Chairmen (and deputy Chairmen)of the Departmental Committees, the representation withintheir ranks of the minority community, and the formal powersof the Council of the Assembly composing all the Chairmen,and Deputies, should mark the effective involvement of theminority and secure it a powerful voice in the formulationof policy decisions about the government of the Provinceand in day-to-day administration.   The Secretary of Statemight initially be required to act as arbiter and would havethe formal powers to do so;   but it would be in all the localparties&apos; interests to develop conventions and proceduresto avoid having to involve Westminster in the settlementof disputes./Implications for Northern Ireland Representation at Vestmins3.39 There is one further question that is prompted by theproposals set out above.   Ever since 1920 Northern Irelandhas been represented at Ytestminster by twelve^ Members ofParliament.   Over most of this period many aspects of thegovernment of Northern Ireland were the responsibility oflocally elected representatives at Stormont.   In 1972 Stormontwas prorogued and direct rule assumed.   In 1978 a Conferenceunder the Chrirmanship of the Speaker of the House of Commons4  Additionally, until 19*8: there        one University Member.
- 28 -recommended that the number of Northern Ireland ParliamentaryConstituencies should be increased to seventeen (with somediscretion given to the Boundary Commission to vary the numberto either 18 or 16).   Effect was given to the recommendationsof the Speaker&apos;s Conference in the House of Commons (Re-distribution of Seats) Act 1979* and the Boundary Commissionis currently at work revising the Northern Ireland constituencies.If once again an elected assembly Z    ~- -m-----:&quot;.;-legislative and otherwere established in Northern Ireland withiwide-ranging powers,to reconsiderit would be- reasonable   ^ , -v Northern Ireland representation atWestminster^ -Summary of Proposals for a Locally Elected Administration3.40 The proposals for the outer framework (paras 3.3 - 3.12)and the options (paras 3-19 - 3*38) may be summarised as follows.3.41 The outer framework would consist of:(1) a province-wide administration based on a singleelected body of about 80 members;(2) PR(STV) would be the method of election;(3) the range of subjects to be transferred would&apos; bebroadly similar to that transferred in 1973;(4) the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland would retain responsibility for reserved matters, such aslaw and order, and for the consideration* of NorthernIreland&apos;s public expenditure programme in the overallUK context;(5) an advisory council would provide a forum forgeneral discussion and consultation with the Secretaryof State on those matters on which he remainedresponsible to Parliament;
(6) the Assembly would be empowered to legislate ontransferred matters;(7) individual Assembly members would be responsiblefor the executive direction of the NI Departments;(8) there   would be representative Departmental Committeeswith extensive investigatory, scrutinising, advisoryand legislative powers;(9) existing safeguards against discrimination would beat least maintained*3.42   The options arise in relation to the crucial questionof the formation of the Executive.   Conventional approacheswill not meet the essential requirement which is a fair andresponsible position for both communities in the administrationof Northern Ireland&apos;s affairs.   The first option would meetthe requirement by ensuring that any party represented in theAssembly and winning a certain proportion of the popular votehad a seat or seats in the Executive.   The Executive could beformed by direct election by the electorate at large, or byelection from within the Assembly or by the allocation ofseats to all parties in proportion to their strength in theAssembly.   However the Executive was formed it would needto command and retain the support of at least 50% + 1in the Assembly.   The second option would achieve therequirement by balancing the power of the Executive, whichv/ould have no guaranteed places for minority representatives,against the power of another institution within the Assembly,-the Council of the Assembly, on which minority representativesthrough constituting the Opposition would have a prominent piacThe Council of the Assembly would need to have certain formalpowers as the source of its influence on the overallCOMFIDEi-iTIAl
administration of Northern Ireland.   These might includepowers to delay, refer back, or block the Executive&apos;slegislative and public expenditure proposals, and to referdiscriminatory actions to an outside appeals body. Toprevent exercise of these powers from bringing the processof government to a halt the Secretary of State would have areferee function with powers to override by Order.
COf# MTflt *&apos;31(INCLUSIONS.1  It is not desirable to continue indefinitely with the system of&apos;direct rule&quot; as the means of governing Northern Ireland.     The Governmenteeks therefore to bring about a transfer of responsibility for some of theovers at present exercised from Westminster to locally elected representatives,n accordance with the principles set out in its Working Paper for theonference on the Government of Northern Ireland (reproduced in paragraph 1.3bove).    The Government believes that the proposals set out in this documentcould secure such a transfer in a way calculated to meet the special needsf the people of Northern Ireland.4.2 The Government now intends to embark on the fullest possible programmeof consultation and discussion.     If, in the event, it concludes that proposalsalong these lines would secure the acceptance of the people of Northern Irelandd the participation of their political leaders in their operation, it willring forward legislative proposals before Parliament.     In the absence of suchcceptance, the Government would then explore other ways of making theovernment of Northern Ireland more responsive to the wishes of the peoplef Northern Ireland.     Such alternatives could involve a progressive.pproach to the transfer of a range of powers to a locally elected Assembly,thatkuch as      mentioned in paragraph 6 of the original Working Paper for theAonference...3 Her Majesty&apos;s Government urges all sections of the Northern Irelandomniumty to give serious consideration to the proposals in this documentearing in mind the urgent need of the Province for institutions which willssist in the task of reconciliation and reconstruction.     It is the Government&apos;sinn hope that thereby can be achieved a system of Government which&apos;the peoplef Northern Ireland will support.\ mm
