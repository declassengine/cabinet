SECRETAWT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 37 COPY NO2 July 1980CABINETTHE PAY OF MINISTERS, MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENTAND SENIOR PUBLIC SERVANTS: TOP SALARIES 1REVIEW BODY REPORTS 14 AND 15Memorandum by the Secretary of the Cabinet1. At their meeting on 1 July (CC(80) 26th Conclusions) the Cabinetinstructed me to circulate a further note illustrating the options open to themin respect of the salaries of Ministers and of the groups covered by the14th Report of the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB), if it was agreed thatthe increase fcr Members of Parliament (MFs) should be reduced from the14. 6 per cent recommended in TSRB 15 to 9.6 per cent, to produce a salaryof  11, 750 from 13 June 1980.   In the tables attached columns A and B showcurrent salary rates and the rates recommended by the TSRB respectively.The basis on which the new options, shown in succeeding columns, havebeen calculated is described in the rest of this note.MINISTERS2, As to Ministers of State and Parliamentary Secretaries in the House ofLords, the Cabinet noted that they received neither a Parliamentary salary noran attendance allowance, and wished to explore further the possibility of their 1receiving some payment in lieu.   It is doubtful whether an attendanceallowance (which is intended to defray the incidental expenses incurred bypeers as a result of attending the House of Lords) would be appropriate forMinisters; and it would not be taxable.    It is therefore recommended that thepayment should take the form of an addition to the salary.   It is suggestedthat the addition should be the same amount for Ministers of State andParliamentary Secretaries; should be added to the salaries decided upon as aresult of this review; and should thereafter be treated for all purposes aspart of the salary.    It is suggested that the amount of the addition should be 4,000, which is about 60 per cent of the amount of the Parliamentary salarydrawn by Ministers of State and Parliamentary Secretaries in the House ofCommons.1SECRET
SECRET3. Under existing legislation (the Ministerial Salaries Act 19-75) it is notpossible to prescribe one rate of salary for some Ministers of State (andsome Parliamentary Secretaries) and another rate for others.    But the ratesprescribed under the Act are maxima.   It would therefore be possible to giveeffect to the proposal in paragraph 2 by prescribing the new rates proposed forMinisters of State and Parliamentary Secretaries in the Lords as the rates forall Ministers of State and Parliamentary Secretaries, and ensuring thatsalaries we:e paid to the Ministers of State and Parliamentary Secretaries inthe Commons at the lower levels by administrative action and through the Votecontrol.4. Table I attached indicates the salary rates for Ministers which wouldresult from the following decisions:Cabinet MinistersC. Increases of 9. 6 per centD. Increases of 7. 5 per centE. Increases of 5. 0 per centMinisters of State (Commons) ISlC.       Increases of 9. 6 per cent   ^Ministers of State (Lords)C.       Increases of 9. 6 per centF.

Increases of 9. 6 per centF.       Increases of 9. 6 per cent plus the additional salary proposedin paragraph 2 above.Salaries of other members of the Government (junior Lords of the Treasuryetc) would be increased by 9. 6 per cent.TSRB 14 GROUPS (TABLES 2 TO 4)5. The other tables attached show the salary rates for each of the fourTSRB groups which would result from the following decisions:2SECRET
SECRETC. Reduce the general level of increase recommended by TSRB 14of about 19 per cent (ie excluding the additional increases recommendedto restore differentials and to improve the relative position of thejudiciary) in the same proportion as it is proposed to reduc- theincrease proposed by TSRB 15 for Members of Parliament (MPs) (thatis to say, by 35 per cent to not more than 12j per cent), butredistributable over the grades concerned so as broadly to preservethe pattern of differentials recommended by the TSRB,    Such adecision would reduce the overall cost of the increases to TSRB 14groups to about half the average increase of 25 per cent which wouldresult from implementing the TSRB recommendations in full(including their proposed special treatment to deal with differentialproblems); it could still be represented, therefore, as treating thesegroups mere harshly than MPs and Ministers by comparison with theTSRB recommendations.D. Reduce the average increase to 9. 6 per cent (equivalent to areduction of 50 per cent from the general level of increaserecommended by the TSRB), redistributing over the grades concernedso as to preserve the pattern of differentials recommended by theTSP-B.6. This memorandum does not illustrate the option of simply reducingall the RSRB 14 recommendations by 35 per cent, in line with the reductionproposed for MPs; this would produce an average increase of over 16 percent, with figures ranging from  21, 575 for Under Secretaries to  35, 000 forthe top Permanent Secretaries.HIGHER CIVIL SERVICE (TABLE 2)7. It will be seen that both C and D involve putting the rate for UnderSecretaries below the Assistant Secretary maximum suggested by payresearch; either C or D would therefore entail decisions to set aside payresearch for Assistant Secretaries and to refuse arbitration on the scale to beimposed.8. The scale in D would create a further severe compression ofdifferentials, particularly between Assistant Secretaries and SeniorPrincipals and Assistant Secretaries and Principals.   It would also involvesetting aside the results of pay research not only for 1,150 AssistantSecretaries (and 3, 000 in grades linked to Assistant Secretary) but also to asmaller extent for 730 Senior Principals (and 1, 200 in grades linked to SeniorPrincipal).3SECRET
SECRETSENIOR OFFICERS OF THE ARMED FORCES (TABLE 2)9. The scales proposed both in C and in D would create a reversedifferential between the medical Brigadier and equivalent, whose s J.aryresulting from the latest Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) report is 21 000, and medical Major Generals and equivalent, who are at present paidat the same rate as &quot;combatant&quot; Major Generals and Under Secretaries. Toput the salary rate for all those at that grade or rank at a sufficiently highlevel to give a reasonable differential between the medical Brigadier and themedical Major General would put the weighted average cost of the increaseoutside the ranges proposed.10. We have considered whether it would be possible to avoid the problemsreferred to in paragraphs 6 and 7 by putting the Under Secretary rate up to,say,  21, 750.   This solution would be possible only if Ministers would beprepared to contemplate overall costs outside the ranges proposed and itwould not be possible to compensate by sharper reductions at higher levelssufficiently to bring the weighted average cost within the ranges proposed,because of the large preponderance of numbers at the Under Secretary andequivalent level.11. If that solution is unacceptable, the only solution to the problem of themedical Major Generals and equivalent (of whom there are only 18) appears tobe to set a special rate for them at a level higher than the general rate forUnder Secretaries and &quot;combatant&quot; Major Generals.    They would have to begiven a lead of  1, 000 if the Under Secretary rate was set at  20, 500(Scale C) and of  1, 500 if the Under Secretary rate was set at  20, 000(column D).THE JUDICIARY (TABLE 3)12. TSRB 14 altered the relativities between members of the judiciary andthe other groups covered by its remit because of special factors applying only&quot;to the judiciary - briefly, the difficulty of recruiting lawyers of the necessaryquality to the bench against the attractions of high earnings at the bar. Thusthe High Court judge, who is at present paid at the same rate as a fullPermanent Secretary ( 28, 500), was to have his salary increased by  1,000more than that of a Permanent Secretary.    The effect of applying a general&quot;deflator&quot; to all the TSRB recommendations would be to reduce these specialincreases, as well as the general increases, by 35 per cent.   In Scale C forthe judiciary we have rounded up the increases proposed (except for the LordChief Justice) so as to come closer (in some cases all the way) to restoringthe cash value of the special increases recommended by the TSRB.    This hasput the weighted average increase for the judiciary in column C slightly above.12. 5 per cent.4SECRET
