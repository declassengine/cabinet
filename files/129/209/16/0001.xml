CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 41 COPY NO 8211 July 1980CABINETHOUSE OF COMMONS PROCEDUREMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster1         We are committed to giving the House an opportunity to reachdecisions on the outstanding recommendations of the first report from theSelect Committee on Procedure for Session 1977-78.    (We have alreadydealt with their recommendations to set up departmental Select Committeesand about sessions and sittings. )   Paragraphs 3 to 10 of this memorandumseek the agreement of colleagues to the line I propose to take in a debatelater this month on the recommendations on Public Bills, subordinate andEuropean legislation and some outstanding recommendations on SelectCommittees.    Paragraph 11 deals with financial control.    (The Annexeslist all the relevant recommendations and the line I have it in mind to takeabout them.)   I envisage a general debate followed by votes on a series ofresolutions, some tabled by the Government and some by other Membersinterested in procedural matters.    The House will expect a free vote onall resolutions and amendments.2.        I have consulted influential Members on all aides of the House. Myconsultations have shown a widespread concern to improve the House&apos;sscrutiny of legislation and subordinate legislation.   The ProcedureCommittee&apos;s recommendations to this end will receive general support andlittle opposition in debate.    Only on the extent to which the House shouldseek to bind the hands of Ministers in European negotiations (seeparagraph 8 below) is opinion likely to divide on party lines. Theconsultations leave me in no doubt that if we were to reject out of hand themajor outstanding recommendations and appear to be ignoring theconsidered views of the Procedure Committee we risk defeat.   There is,however, general acceptance that any Government must control the businessof the House and be able to get legislation through Parliament within asingle Session.    My aim is to preserve these essential elements ofGovernment control while meeting the desire for further proceduralreform.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALPUBLIC BILLS (Recommendations 4-14)3. The present procedure for considering Bills in Standing Committeehas few friends.   The Procedure Committee received much evidencefavouring the establishment of pre-legislation Committees of the House orthe reference of all Bills to the relevant departmental Select Committees.Recommendation 5 rejects these ideas in favour of a compromise wherebythe majority of Bills would be automatically referred to new &quot;Public BillCommittees&quot;.   These would have powers to seek written evidence and totake oral evidence in up to three public sessions before considering a Billclause by clause in the usual way.    Evidence would come from Ministersand officials and from interested organisations.    From a businessmanager&apos;8 point of view, it would be simpler to take no action on therecommendation since it would involve more work for Ministers andMembers and the procedure could add some weeks to the passage of a Bill.4. My consultations have, however, convinced me that it would beneither safe nor wise to put before the House a proposal to rejectrecommendation 5.    Such a negative stance would court a vote in favour ofit, or even in favour of setting up pre-legislation committees which wouldradically alter our procedures and seriously delay Government legislation.Instead I believe in experimental approach is the right one.   1- have it inmind to go to the House proposing a limited experiment next Session inwhich two or three Government Bills which are significant but notcontentious in party terms are sent to Public Bill Committees.5. If colleagues favour the experimental approach I would propose asessional order on the lines shown in Annex A (resolution 5) in which theGovernment would have the initiative in choosing the Bills.    The oralevidence would be confined to a maximum of three eessions, to be concludedwithin, say, three weeks from the date of the first sitting of the Committee.I would indicate that even if the experiment were successful the Governmentwould expect the procedure to be applied to selected Bills rather than to allBills in future Sessions.    I would also ask the House to agree to a parallelexperiment with the same Bills with recommendation 6, allowing additionalsittings at the end of the Committee stage to consider drafting amendmentsand amendments arising from Government undertakings.    Such a procedureshould save time on the floor of the House on report.6. Recommendations 8 and 9 seek to prescribe minimum intervalsbetween stages of Bills and to limit the Government&apos;s flexibility in the useof the guillotine.    They are not acceptable as they stand.   I would hope topersuade the House that the Government will continue to use its bestendeavours to meet the spirit of these recommendations and that amendmentof Standing Orders would bring undue rigidity.    Recommendations 10-14support earlier recommendations of the Ronton Committee on the Preparationof Legislation (Cmnd 6053).   I do not propose to open up this large separatesubject in the debate but, if the recommendations are discussed, to indicatethe Government&apos;8 view on the lines set out in Annex A.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSUBORDINATE LEGISLATION (Recommendations 15-21)7. Recent exchanges in the House have reinforced the dissatisfactionwith the present operation of the &quot;merits&quot; Standing Committee to w&apos;lichsubordinate legislation can be referred.    That Committee can resolve onlythat it has &quot;considered&quot; a Statutory Instrument.    It cannot pass a substantivemotion about it.    Even if it resolves that it declines to consider theInstrument, the Government does not have to find time for a subsequentvote or debate on the floor of the House.   If instead the Standing Committeewere to consider substantive motions, votes in Committee would have moresignificance.   There would be problems of finding sufficient Governmentbackbenchers to ensure a Government majority.    But the ineffectivenessof the present procedure cannot be defended.   1 therefore propose to acceptwith modifications recommendation 18 to give more powers to theCommittee; details are in Annex B.    On this basis, the Government wouldstill remain in control of the situation on the floor of the House.    There isless dissatisfaction with the work of the joint &quot;scrutiny&quot; Committee whichconsiders the form and vires of subordinate legislation. Recommendations15-17, which seek to give the Committee powers to delay StatutoryInstruments coming into force, would unduly complicate the law.   If weaccept much ot Recommendation 18 I believe we can ask the House to rejectthese other recommendations.EUROPEAN COMMUNITY LEGISLATION (Recommendations 22-30)8. The main interest here will centre on recommendation 25 for adeclaratory resolution of the House about the circumstances in which theGovernment should be able to approve European Community legislationwhich has been recommended for debate by the &quot;scrutiny&quot; Select Committeeon European legislation.   As colleagues know, we have given an undertakingthat only in exceptional circumstances will Ministers approve suchlegislation without prior debate.   We must retain the flexibility of thepresent undertaking.    We can, however, accept a declaratory resulutionusing the form of words given in Annex C, which does not tie the hands ofMinisters at Brussels.    It is based, with slight modification, on a draftsuggested to me by the Scrutiny Committee itself.    Our backbenchers willaccept it, although many Labour Members will want a resolution containinga more binding form of words.9. I have already consulted colleagues about the proposals in Annex Dfor our response to the other recommendations on the handling of EuropeanCommunity legislation.    I need draw Cabinet&apos;s attention only to the proposalto accept part of recommendation 28 enabling a Standing Committee to holdsubstantive debates on documents we ask the House to refer to it.   As withthe parallel recommendation for subordinate legislation (paragraph 7 above)the change will make more demands on the time of Members in StandingCommittee.    But it should reduce the time needed for debate on the floorof the House.     . -3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALDEPARTMENTAL SELECT COMMITTEES10. There is pressure from some departmental Select Committees andthe Liaison Committee to set up new sub-committees.    I have male clearin consultation the Government&apos;s view that it is too early to review theoperation of the Committees.   I shall not therefore include in the motionfor debate any reference to Select Committees (thus preventing amendmentsabout their structure or about sub-committees).    I shall, however, notein my speech the outstanding recommendations about them and respond asnecessary in the terms shown in Annex E.FINANCIAL CONTROL (Recommendations 68-70)11. The Procedure Committee did not study this subject in any depth(see Annex F).   Recommendations 66-68 have been overtaken by ourGreen Paper on the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General, on whichwe now await comments.    More generally, there is a widespread feelingin the House that the time has come for a much more radical review of themethods by which the House exercises control over supply and considerssupplementary estimates.    I would like, it colleagues agree, to confirmin the forthcoming debate that the Government would welcome theestablishment next Session of a fresh Procedure Committee to undertakea major study with the following terms of reference:&quot;To consider the House&apos;s present procedures for consideringand voting on the Government&apos;s requests for supply and tomake recommendations&quot;.CONCLUSION12. While I propose to reject many of the detailed recommendations ofthe Procedure Committee which would unduly weaken our control over thebusiness of the House, I believe that the proposals in this memorandumwould show both party and Parliament that the Government remainscommitted to a practical and evolutionary path of procedural reform. Inpreparation for the forthcoming debate on the outstanding recommendationsof the Procedure Committee, I invite my colleagues to agree that I should:a. propose a limited experiment next Session for the scrutinyof Bills by public bill committees;b. table a resolution of the House incorporating the presentundertaking about the approval of European Community legislation;c. respond to the other recommendations of the Committeeon the lines indicated in the Annexes of this memorandum;4CONFIDENTIAL

Re command a fc1 onaGeneral Coram ent.fitefepoee^i mot uubute(k)   Some bills, particularly of a technical, non-urgent,character, may be suitable for committal to selectcommittees, but this procedure would not lie destreble for thegenerality of bills.     The membership of a standingcommittee on a bill should, however, include some membersdrawn from the select committee responsible for the scrutinyof the administration of the Government department ordepartments concerned (paragraph 2.17).(5)   Standing Committee on bills should in future be permittedto have up to three sittings in select committee form for thepurpose of taking evidence in public} bills would automaticallystand committed to committees with this power (to be known as&quot;public bill committees&apos;*), unless the House otherwise ordered(paragraph 2.19-2.20).(6) A Standing Comreittee9 or public bill committee should beempowered to reconvene, before reporting a bill to the Ilouse,for the purpose of considering amendments arising from under takings, consequential amendments and drafting amendments(paragraph 2.21).(7) Unopposed drafting amendments should be allowed on theThird Reading of Lords Bills (paragraph 2.25).(fl) Minimum intervals between the stages of bills shouldbe prescribed by standing order (paragraph 2*28).(9)   There should be a minimum period of notice forallocation of time notions and motions to agree with theResolution of a Business Committee|    it should no longer bepossible to include provisions relating to more than onebill in an allocation of time motion or to provide thatinstructions to a Committee on a.bill should be decidedwithout debate}   the Business Committee should in futurebe nominated on a motion moved by the Committee ofSelection, and its membership should if necessary beenlarged to reflect the composition of the House(paragraph 2.38)      A procedure already exists for committing bills to selectcommittees.     It is largely used for private members bills.k.     The membership of a standing committee is not determinedby the Government, but by the Committee of Selection,Paragraphs k and 5 of the covering memorandum propose anexperiment.     Committal to a public bill committee should beon the initiative of the Government.     A time limit should beplaced ab initio on the first (evidence-taking) part of theproceedings of public bill committees.Paragraph 5 of the covering nemorandom proposes an experimentconfined to bills sent to public bill committee.Acceptable to the Government, If the House wishes it.While the Government should continue to make every effort toallow sufficient time between the stages of a Bill, embodimentin Standing Orders would remove essential flexibility in thearrangement of the legislative programme*     Some &quot;emergency&quot;Bills are needed by any Government in most sessions*a*     Tbe Government have been sparing in using guillotines*They will continue to be so, and to meet the spirit of thsrecommendation, especially in not using a single guillotinemotion to cover more than one bill*   But the embodiment ofthese recommendations in a standing order would make for&gt;toomuch rigidity;   the Government must retain some flexibility inthe arrangement of the legislative programme*b.

Standing Committeesshould In future be empowered to consider substantivemotions and, in certain cases, further debates of limitedduration could be held in the House (paragraphs 3*15-3.18).On occasion need to take statutory Instrument* ore the PEacrwithout waiting for the Joint Committee.    If veto embodiedin Standing Orders, opportunity for deliberate stalling brJoint Committee.Effect would be to extend the potential period within whicha negative instrument could be annullea from the usual%0 days to a date, if later* of 10 days after the JointCommittee on Statutory Instruments hsd drawn the attentionof the House to the Instrument concerned. Thisrecommendation, which would require legislation, wouldincrease undertainty as to when negative instruments couldhe expected to have completed their passage, through theHouse*   This could be detrimental to administrativeefficiency.   Aa with recommendation (l5)  time-tablepotentially taken out of Government control and certaintyof implementation dates eroded.    kO days long accepted byParliament os adequate praying time, and Joint Committeeshould normally be able to report in sufficient time toenable their views to be taken into account before normalpraying time has expired.This recommendation would require legislation.   Hie effectwould bo to convert any negative Instrument which theJoint Connlttee had drawn to the attention of the HouseInto an affirmative instrument which would require debateand positive approval by the House*   It would thus givethe Joint Committee power to change statutory instrumentcategories agreed by the House.   It would also, likerecommendation (16), which would bo the leaser evil,create potential uncertainty regarding the implementationdates of negative instruments.This concerns the reference of statutory instruments(essentially affirmative orders and prayers againstnegative instruments) to Standing Committees on StatutoryInstruments (the &apos;Merits1 Committee) under SO 73A. Atpresent a Minister may move that an order shall bs referredto the Merits Committee, but 20 or mors Members can blockthe reference.   The Committee sits for up to If hours onthe basis of a nonsubstantive motion, and the question onreport to the House is put without debste after 10 pm. Therevised procedure proposed would provide, inter alia, forthe debate in committee on be on a substantive motion andfor there to be power to enforce debate on the Floor ifcommittee do not approve the instrument or recommendannulment.   Full implementation of these proposals mightsignificantly add to pressures on Floor time and loas offlexibility in programme planning.   On the other hand, thepresent impotence of the Merits Committee has led toParliamentary criticism, ond certain of its procedures(eg nonsubstantive Motions) are not readily defensible*-- i &apos;:-&apos;r^ .  .  - &amp; ifcw ensure &apos;i&apos;lftafc. whenever possible, debateson statutory instruments ond prayers do not take place untilJoint Committee has bad opportunity to consider Instrumentconcerned*   But point bat that occasions arise when pressuresof Parliamentary business or the need for immediateadministrative action prevent this, ie need to preserveloophole.   Ministers will do all they can to keep theseInstances to a minimum.   Advise House to rsjsct adoption ofrecommendation.Advise rejection of recommendation and avoid commitment tolegislation*Point out that this recommendation would enable a committeeto overturn decisions of the House ie to change, in effect,an instrument which the House had previously decided shouldbe subject to negative procedure into an affirmativeinstrument.   Advise rejection of recommendation and avoidcommitment to legislation.Recommend revision of S073A and powers of Merits Committee,modifying Procedure Committee proposals as necessary to avoidrisks of increasing the amount of Floor time spent onstatutory instruments, potential whipping problems at thecommencement of public business, and&apos;loss of flexibility inprogramme planning*[detailed proposals as in schedule A]

/Recommendationi (44) Greater opportunities should he available for debates onI  seleet committee reportsj to this end eight Mondays eaoh! ^ session should be allotted as &quot;select committee days&quot;; thechoice of reports to be debated on these days should be leftto the Government, after consultation with other parties andwith select committee chairmen; debates should take place onsubstantive motions moved by the chairmen of the committeesconcerned (paragraphs 6.2-6.13).(43) Government departments should normally he required topublish their observations on select committee reports with-in two months of publication of the reports) a record ofreporte made, and Government observations received, shouldbe included in the sessional Select Committee Returns(paragraph) 6.17).(46) Select Committees should in future be nominated on amotion tabled by the Committee of Selection (paragraph 6.19);the procedure for moving for the nomination of selectcommittees under SO No 13 should not be available untilobjection had been signified to the Committee of Selection&apos;smotion (paragraph 6.2l).1(47) The publication by newspapers, etc., of reports ofevidence given by witnesses to select committees meetingin public should be permitted, before ouch evidence hasbeen reported to the Rouse (paragraph 6.23).(48) Select committees should report the Minutes ofProceedings of their Sub-committtees (paragraph 6.27).(ft) The chairman of a select committee should have asubstantive vote, like other Members, and no casting vote;questions would be decided in the negative unlesssupported by a majority of the votes cast (paragraph 6.30)General CommentProposed Line for DebateGeneral purport of recommendation would be to doubleamount of time recently taken on Floor for debates onSelect Committee reporto.   Present commitment is three dayson Select Committee reports (2 in Supply, | in Governmenttime).   Three extra Government days might be needed. Moretime might be available if amount of legislation reduced.Avoid commitment to additional time or 8 Mondays. Under-take to review in. light of how many reports are producedand the extent to which they need to be considered separateor relate to issues covered in other debates.Major reports may require more than two months for fullconsideration.Avoid absolute commitment but state that Departments havebeen instructed to do their best to meet the two monthsdeadline and, where this is not possible, to explain tothe Committee, before the expiry of the two month period,why the deadline cannot be met.The Departmental Committees (end the Scottish and WelshAffairs Committees) are now nominated on a Motion tabledby the Committee of Selection.   The Government did notaccept the extension of this practice, as recommended, toall select committees - for example, the Public AccountsCommittee continues to be nominated on a Motion tabled byGovernment Ministers, and it is presumed thai Ministers willwish to continue this practice.   As regards SO No 13, theposition under the present Sessional Order for thenomination Of the membership of the Departmental Committeesdiffers from the proposal made by the Procedure Committee, inthat SO No 13 (righto of Private Members in reepeot ofthe tabling of Motione for the nomination of SelectCommittees) does not apply.   Procedure Committee had.recommended modified application.Essentially recognition of fait accompli since evidencemay already have been broadcast.Terms of reference of Departmental Committeee givecommittees power to report the Minutes of Evidence beforesub-committees.   But no power to compel them to do so.The present position is that the chairman of a select Committeevotes only where there Is equality of voices in thecommittee.   This, in effect, deprives the party to whichchairman belongs of one vote unless voices are equal. Theproposed change would favour the chairman&apos;s party, and wouldbring practice into line with that of House of Lords.Oppose,,as necessary, the exteneiou of nomination by theCommittee of Selection to further Select Committees.Concede application of modified SO No 13 procedure toDepartmental Committee nominations if pressed.Leave to House and table Motion accordingly, at a laterstage, if appropriate.Leave to Douse to decide and table Motion accordingly, at alater stage, if appropriate.Leave to House to decide and table Motion accordingly, ata later stage, if appropriate.
CONFIDENTIALReoommendation(50) Soloct committees should continue to appoint their ownchairmen, hut the convention of appointing Members ofopposition parties to the Chair of certain committees shouldbe maintained and. if possible, extended(paragraph 6.31).(51) Con sideration should be given to the payment of amodest additional salary to the chairmen of seleotoommittees (paragraph 6.33).(52) The new select oommittees are likely to require morspermanent staff resources} arrangements to recruit thenecessary additional staff should be est in hand immediately(paragraph 6.37).(53) n ie restriction on the appointment of specialistadvisers &quot;for the purposes of psrtioular inquiries&quot;should be removed, and all sejeot committee should be freeto appoint whatever advisers they wish for the purpose oftheir work} the scales of fees for advisers should be laiddown by the Commission (paragraph 6.40).(5%) The Commission should establish suitable procedures&quot;for assessing proposals for the recruitment of full-timespecialist staff required by seleot committees(paragraph 6.4l)| and should be responsible for consideringrequests for assistance for committees from the Exchequerand Audit Department (paragraph 6.44).(55) Members should be able to oall on personal researchassistance, paid centrally by the House, and in addition to,and separate from, the provision of secretarial assistance(paragraph 6.46),(56) The Select Committee on House of Commons (Services)should undertake an immediate review of the presentaccommodation available for committees and their staffand of future accommodation needs, and should produce aplan for accommodation for Members and parliamentary staffs\paragraph 6.V?).General CommentConvention of appointing opposition Members as ohairmen ofsome committees has been extended.

Recommendation(57) For the time being the orders of reference of mostdepartmentally-related select committees should not includethe power to appoint sub-committees with investigativepowers| specific exception should be nude for the TreasuryCommittee, the Foreign Affairs Committee and the HomeAffairs Committee, all of which should bs Empowered toAppoint no more than two investigstive sub-committees(paragraph 6*48) (58) Other committees desiring to appoint investigstive  sub-committees (or joint sub-committees) should patappropriate proposals to the Liaison Committee whichwould, if it concluded that adequate facilities wereavailable to support the work of the proposed sub-committees, table the necessary motions lnthe Housef suchsub committees would be required to report within aspecified period of time (paragraph 6.%9) (99) All select committees should be empowered to appointsub-commlttees (or joint sub committees), without the powerto send for persons* papers and records* for such purposes aathe analysis of evidence* the preparation of reports* orthe consideration of a committee&apos;s programme of work(paragraph 5.56)*(60) All select committees should be empowered to take evidencand deliberate jointly with other committees, to exchangepapers with other committees* to moke joint reports orspecial reports, or formally to request the opinions ofother committees on any matters (paragraph 6.53).(61) The informal Chairmen&apos;s Liaison Committee should bereplaced by a select committee* to be known as the LiaisonCommittee, consisting of one representative of eachpermanent select committee, together with additional Membersto ensure that the overall membership of the committeereflects the composition of the House(paragraphs 6.56 - 6.58)*mGeneral CommentThe Treasury and Civil Service Committee, the ForeignAffairs Committee and the Home Affaire Committee hove beengranted powers to appoint one investigative sub-committee.Five committees (Defence, Energy* Soottish Affairs*Transport and Welsh Affairs) have* with the support of theLiaison Committee, sought power to establish sub-committees,Further sub-committees would osuse additional work forMinisters and Departments. It would seem inappropriate forthe Initiative for their establishment to lie with theLiaison Committee rather than with Ministers.Not clear why informal arrangements inadequate.No approach so far made by select committees.Proposed Line for DebateOppose, as necsssry* the establishment of furthersub-committees by these committees this session.

CONFIDENTIALroWEU TO SEND FOR PERSONS, PAPERS AND RBCORDS (Recommendations 62-65)ANNEX BR&lt;&amp; c ontmen da t i oil(62)   Soloot committees should regard any refusal by governmentdepartments to provide information relating to departmentalor interdepartmental organisation - unless fully explainedand justified to their satisfaction - as a matter of seriousconcern which should be brought to the attention of theRouse (paragraph 7*15).(63)   Memoranda submitted to select committees by governmentdepartments and non-departmental publio organisations shouldinclude a declaration of the persons and organ!satione withwhoa consultations have taken plaoe prior to their submission(paragraph 7*16). v-&apos;(6k)   Select committees should be empowered to order theattendance of Ministers to give evidence to them(paragraph 7 2l), and to order the production of papers andrecords by Ministers* including Secretaries of State(paragraph 7-22). J^!3*(65)   In the event of a refusal by a Minister to produospapers and records required by a aeleot committee the 7committee should be empowered to claim preoedenoa over publicbusiness for a debate on a Motion for an Address or for anOrder for the Return of Papers, unless time is provided bythe Government by the sixth sitting day after the firstappearance of the Motion (paragraph 7.25). 4General CommentInstructions to Departments state that normal presumption shouldbe that detailed information about the organisational structureof departments should be made available to seleot committeea ifrequested.    Information about inter departmental organisationwill be provided, subject to the need to take into accountthe prinoiple of the collective responsibility of Ministersto Parliament.This recommendation has been drawn to the attsntion ofdepartments end non departmental bodies with whom departmentalconsultations take place prior to the submission of departmentalmemoranda . to select committees.    Departmental memoranda shownin draft to non-departmental bodies should iilcludo a statementof the bodies&quot;concerned (Memorandum of Guidance for Officialsappearing before Select Committees (paragraph 50)).By oonvSntion select committees &quot;invite&quot;, and do not &quot;order&quot;,the attendance of Membere, including Ministers. Selectcommittees may at present, in effeot, order the production ofpapers held in the custody of a Ministora, but only if hois not a Secretary of State.   In the oaee of s Secretaryof State the House must proceed by way of ah Address to theSovereign.IThis would provide select committees with ihe power to enforceautomatic debate on the Floor of any alleged Minieterialrefusal to produce papers.   This could be a threat to otherbusiness and might be exploited. It would seem necessary thatthere should be evidence of generel concern in the Douse oversuch an alleged refusal before a debate wae required to takeplace.Proposed Line for DebateAs indicated by the First Special Report of theEducation, Science and Arts Committee (&quot;Hie Provisionof Information by Government Departments to SelectCommittees&quot;), to which a Government reply will bemade shortly, seleot committees can already drawalleged departmental failures in this field to theattention of the Houso.   The House may accordinglyconeider that the recommendation is effective withoutthe need for further endorsement.Implementing notion has been taken,Maintain line token by Government in debate (June 1979)when departmental eelect committees established, iemaintain existing position but agree to reconsider ifmore formal powere ore needed for select committees toenforoe their wishes. &gt;Maintain existing position, ie no eelect committeepower to enforce debate on the Floor.   But, ifnecessary, give general undertaking that when thereie clearly wideepread concern in the Nouss over sucha dispute regarding the production of papers byMinisters, tine for a debate will be found.
He commendation(66) The Government should enter into negotiations withthe local authority associations with a view to preparinglegislation to implement an amalgamation of theExchequer and Audit Department and the District Audit(paragraph 8.13),(67) New legielation should establish the principlethat the accounts of all bodies in receipt of funds votedby Parliament should be subject to examination by theComptroller and auditor General9 with the proviso that theC &amp; AG may authorise alternative audit procedures inrespect of individual bodies to whose accounts hs has aright of access (paragraph 8*14).(68) The audit staff should be regarded no servants ofthe House* and the cost of the national audit activitiesshould be carried on the Vote of the House, thus allowingthe Commission to determine the overall scale of the auditfunction and the grades, qualifications and salaries ofaudit staff 1   in addition, the House or its committeesshould be able to request the C &amp; AG to undertakeinquiries, but not to direct him to carry out hisinquiries in a particular manner (paragraph 8.2l).(69) All departmental Estimates should be referred to theappropriate departmentally-related committees(paragraph 8.24) (70) The Government should act expeditiously to respondto the suggestions of the Expenditure Committee concerningthe provision of financial information and the manner ofits presentation to the House (paragraph 8.28)|   a reviewof the structure and content of the accounts, statisticalanalyses and other regular reports presented to theHouse should be undertaken, perhaps by the Public AccountsCommittee and the new Treasury Committee* with a view toimproving the means of parliamentary scrutiny(paragraph 8*29).General CommentProposed Line for DebateGreen Paper  The nolo of the Comptroller andAuditor General1 (Cmnd 7843) published earlierthis year and comments from interested bodieeat present awaited*   PAC have launched aseparate enquiry in response to the Green Paper*No conclusions likely this year.Action by Treasury in band.
