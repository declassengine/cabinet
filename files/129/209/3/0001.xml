CONFIDENTIALENT IS THE PROPERTY OF H R BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 28COPY NO19 May 1980CABINETTHE COST OF PARLIAMENTMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy df Lancaster1.        The Cabinet invited me (CC(80) 5th Conclusions, Minute 6)&gt; inconsultation with the Minister of State,  Civil Service Department, and othercolleagues as necessary, to report on how best to examine the scope forreductions in and controls of the cost of Parliament, including the costsfalling on Government Departments, in meeting the demands made on themby Members of Parliament (MPs) and Select Committees.    In thisMemorandum. I examine the direct costs of the running of Parliament, andsome of the indirect costs falling on Government Departments;   and go toconsider ways of improving control and securing economy.2*        It is right that the cost of Parliament should be looked at in the conteof our general policy of reducing public expenditure*   This has not so farbeen done*    Effective control arrangements should exist and be seen to exist*I need not spell out the constitutional difficulties*    Parliament grants supplyto Government*    MPs attach great importance to their independence fromexecutive control*   As recently as 1978 the House of Commons(Administration) Act was passed, with all-Party support, to give the Commoncontrol over the staffing and expenditure of the Departments of the Housethrough the House of Commons Commission, of which the Speaker isChairman, and I am a member in my dual role as Leader of the House andmember of the Government (see paragraph 4 of Annex A)*    Nor will mycolleagues need reminding of the difficulties we have encountered in the lastyear in dealing with the recommendations of the Top Salaries Review Body(TSRB) on pay and allowances for Members of Parliament*    If we decide totake action on the lines discussed in this Memorandum, we should need earlyinformal discussions with the Speaker, the Commission and the Leader of theOpposition*DIRECT COSTS OF PARLIAMENT3*        The facts*   The direct costs of Parliament in 1979-80 were 44 million, and the Estimates for 1980-81 are  51 million*    (Details inAnnex A;   summary table at Annex B)*   Some figures for earlier yearsare given in Annex C*1
CONFIDENTIAL4, Members&apos; salaries, pensions and allowances. Peers&apos; allowances,the costs of staffing and policing the two Houses and the residual cost ofcatering, make up the bulk of the direct costs.    In 1979-80 they totalled 30 million - a marked increase on the previous year.    This included aspecial payment of  3 million to wipe out the accumulated deficit of the Houseof Commons Catering Department.    In the last few years there have beenincreases in real terms in MPs&apos; allowances and in the take-up of Peers&apos;allowances but not in MPs&apos; pay.    There has also been a substantial increasein the staffing of the two House s, and in policing.    In the last five years,staff numbers increased by 28 per cent in the House of Commons, from 424to 545; and in the House of Lords by 26 per   cent from 149 to 188, Theestimate for 1980-81 for Members&apos; salaries, etc. staff, police and cateringis  33 million.    But it does not make provision for secretaries&apos; pensions,or extended free travel for MPs; nor does it take full account of theincreases to be made in secretarial and research assistant allowances, in thestaffing of the Select Committees, or of likely increases in MPs&apos; and staffsalaries, and la overnight allowances.    These might add a further  3 or 4 million*    Reliable forecasts for future years are not available. Recentexperience suggests that there may be further real increases - for example,to make better provision for pre-1964 pensions.5, The remaining direct expenditure of  14 million in 1978-80 was forthe upkeep of the Palace of Westminster; Hansard, printing and stationery;computers; and financial assistance to Opposition parties and grants toParliamentary bodies.   This block of expenditure has fluctuated in real termsin recent years and has been higher than it is now.    The estimates for1980-81 amount to  17 million.    In the following two years, total expenditureon these items is expected to remain steady in constant prices.    An increaseof nearly  2 million in printing costs and the Hansard subsidy (resultingfrom the installation of a new Parliamentary press) should be offset Ky areduction in capital expenditure on the Palace of Westminster.6, The financial arrangements and the scope or need for increasedGovernment influence or control vary markedly between the differentcategories of expenditure. Brieflyr-a. Members&apos; salaries, pensions and allowances ( 16 million,1980-81 Estimate) are determined by resolutions of the House. Theresolutions embody Government proposals following reports by theTSRB, but the House can and does amend the proposals.b. House of Commons&apos; administration costs, including the staffof the Departments of the House ( 11 million), are controlled by theHouse of Commons Commission, advised by the heads of Departmentswho form the House of Commons Board of Management.    Cash limitsof the type now imposed on staff costs in Government Departments donot apply.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALc. House of Lords&apos; administration costs ( 5 million) fall withinan estimate presented by Treasury Ministers;   there is closerconsultation with the Civil Service Department abou* the House ofLords&apos; staff than about the equivalent staff in the Commons.d. The Palace of Westminrter.    Capital works and maintenance( 8 million) are the responsibility of the Secretary of State for theEnvironment, subject to normal Treasury controls.e. Hansard subsidy, printing, stationery and computer costs( 8 million) arise from Parliamentary demands but are borne ondepartmental votes as an &quot;allied service&quot;.7.        The relatively modest administrative costs of the House of Lords aresubject to normal Treasury-type controls, but not to cash limits. Thereappear to be proper controls over works and furnishings at the Palace ofWestminster although the level of expenditure on some aspects does notescape criticism.    The Home Office and the Metropolitan Police havesufficient iuiluestce and incentive to see that the number and cost of policeofficials assigned to Parliament are kept to the minimum consistent withsecurity.    We are making some progress in securing accountability fotclaims for Members&apos; travelling allowances - an area in which there has beenEope for abuse - and I am about to write to my colleagues on the subject.Areas which might be looked at.    On the other hand, the controlser House of Commons staffing and administrative costs are not as tightas we would wish.    There is no system of cash limits.    The House ofCommons Commission is required by the 1978 Act to keep staffing levels andsalaries and other conditions of service broadly in line with those of theHome Civil Service.    There has so far been little informal consultationwith the Civil Service Department.    Nor has an effective central unit toscrutinise the costs of the House Departments yet been established. Thereis no satisfactory system of control over printing, stationery and computercosts; neither House has been willing for these costs to be met on arepayment basis, with the House authorities assuming responsibility forcontrol and accounting.INDIRECT COSTS OF PARLIAMENT9.        The coats imposed by Parliament on Government Departments aremore difficult to assess.    The broad estimates in Annex D suggest that thecost of answering Parliamentary Questions (PQs) is less than  2 million ayear.    The cost of Departments&apos; work in response to Select Committeeenquiries at this stage can be no more than tentative.    The new Committeesare still settling down and there can be no certainty how their work willdevelop.    I have already told the Chairman oftn^Committee that we cannotsupport the establishment of more sub-committees this Session.    We shall,however, come under continuing pressure in the future.    No estimate of thecost of replying to MPs&apos; letters is available but AnnexJS illustrates thevolume of work that is entailed.    The total cost of these three departmental3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALtivities - on PQs, Select Committees and MPs&apos; letters - seems unlikelyto be more than  10 million or so a year.    A thorough exercise across allDepartments to check this estimate would in itself be expensive. Forexample, the laot survey of the cost of Parliamentary Questions was conducte8 years ago: a new survey would cost abcut  20, 000.    If we want a betterappreciation of the indirect costs of Parliament, it would be best to pursueSir Darek Rayner&apos;s recommendation that in the next Session of Parliamentone Department should keep a record of the resources committed in supportof Ministers&apos; and their senior officials&apos; Parliamentary work.    While noDepartment is typical, it should be possible to select one, from which weKght draw lessons that could be applied to central government as a whole.,      In addition to the burdens that can be attributed to Parliament&apos;sactivities, the House exercises a pervasive influence on the work of allDepartments.    Because Ministers are accountable to Parliament for everyaction taken by their Departments, detailed records are kept sometimes forthat purpose alone, and a premium is put on caution, on careful checking andon avoiding mistakes.    This is one of the main differences between theoperations of central government and the private sector.FURTHER EXAMINATION OF COSTSIII      I have considered whether we should approach the Speaker and thepposition about a fresh inquiry into the costs of Parliament.    Such ageneral inquiry would have to be instituted by Parliament and not by theGovernment; it could not appropriately look at ways of reducing costs withinGovernment Departments.    The quickest form of investigation would be aone-man inquiry, but nothing came of the Report on the structure of theadministration of the House of Commons made in 1973 by Sir EdmundCompton, a former Comptroller and Auditor General.    If the Cabinetdecided on a comprehensive inquiry it would, in my view, be best to seek aJoint Committee of both Houses, or a Select Committee of the House ofCommons since Commons expenditure is much the greater part.    A SelectCommittee could identify areas where control of expenditure is lax andsuggest remedies.    We would have to seek terms of reference whichemphasised the theme of economy - including the possible imposition of cashlimits of staff ceilings - but which excluded the level of Members&apos; pay.Whatever the terms of reference, some Members would use the establish-ment of a Select Committee to press for better working conditions andallowances, citing overseas comparisons.    In the light of the earlieranalysis in this paper, I am doubtful whether we need an across-the-boardreview, which could well result in higher rather than reduced expenditure.12,      An alternative approach would be to take a series of more limitedinitiatives which would be valuable in their own right and, taken together,would help to make Parliament more cost-conscious.a. We could see if the Speaker would be willing to support areview by the House of Commons Commission of the system ofcontrol over the staffing and administrative costs of the House ofCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCommons,    Such a review could cover the scope for possibleeconomies and consider the extension of the each limit systemto expenditure on the Houee of Commons (Administration) Vote,b. The House of Lords Offices Committee might be asked toundertake a similar review in relation to the staffing andadministrative costs of the Houss.c. The House of Commons Commission might be asked torecognise the need for the Government (and not just the Leader ofthe House) to be given adequate opportunity to comment on proposalsinvolving significant increases in future expenditure.    The currentreview of staff grading by the consultants, Inbucon is a case in point.d. The House of Commons and the House of Lords OfficesCommittee should be asked to accept that printing (including Hansard),stationery and computer requirements should be obtained, not as anallied service, but as elsewhere, on a repayment basis.    This wouldmean that financial control would be the responsibility of the twoHouses.e. The exercise on indirect costs recommended by Sir DerekRayner (paragraph 9) should proceed and the position be reviewedwhen its findings are known.CONCLUSION13.       I invite the Cabinet to take note of the costs of Parliament identifiedin the memorandum, and of the areas which might be looked at further;and to agree that we should pursue the measures set out in paragraph 12.I seek authority to hold informal talks with the Speaker, the Commissionand the Opposition about the measures affecting the House of Commons.5CONFIDENTIALN St J SPrivy Council Office*9 May 1980

CONFIDENTIAL.    General.     The House of Commons (Administration) Act 1978 provided that Estimatesor all these departments should be presented to Parliament by the House of Commonsommiasion.   The Act, which had all-party support, implemented the recommendations of}ie Eottomley Committee.   The House of Commons Commission is advised by the House ofomnir-is Board of Management (the heads of the departments of the House), and theervices Committee and its sub committees of Members also give advice.   The 1978 Actrovides that House staffing and grading levels, etc should be broadly in line withhost in the Civil Service, and it is open to the House of Commons Commission (ofhich the Leader of the House is one of the six members) to seek CSD advice if theyhoose to do so.     That apart, Ministers can influence the levels of expenditure onlyn bo far as rates of pay are increased in line with general increases in Civilrvice pay..   The Bottomley Committee recommended the gradual development of a unifiedinancial and establishment function serving the various departments of the House,his is not yet fully developed.

In 1980/81 staff cost s areBtimated to be  1,551|000.  Policing.   The House authorities and the Metropolitan Police jointly considerhe appropriate level of police manpower for the Palace of Westminster.   (The costse divided equally between Lords and Commons).     They take the advice of the Jointcurity Committee of both Houses into account.    Although the Metropolitan Police3 not themselves bear the costs they have to provide the police officers from withinheir total establishment (approved by the Home Secretary) and, given a chronichortage of manpower, at the expense of other duties.     They have, therefore, ancentive to keep numbers and costs down to the minimum consistent with security.3CONFIDENTIAL
