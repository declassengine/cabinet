confidentialDocument is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s governmentc(80) 45 copy no     g 222 July 1980cabinetEDUCATION EXPENDITURE 1981-82Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and Science1. In C(80) 44 the Chief Secretary, Treasury, proposes a further cut ofabout  60 million in the schools programme for England in 1981-82. Thiswculd be in addition to the cut of  20- 25 million in higher education(including the universities) and other parts of my programme which in thecircumstances I have offered to make, despite the difficulties outlined inmy letter to him of 8 July*2. The Chief Secretary has had to accept that the further cuts heproposes must fall on the schools; and that this would make it impossibleto honour our Queen1 s Speech commitment to maintain and improve thequality of education.   We have repeated this commitment many times, mostrecently in my speech to the Association of County Councils on 2 July whichwas cleared with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    The Chief Secretarynow argues, less than three weeks later, that we should &quot;modify&quot; ourcommitment on the lines that &quot;resources should be concentrated on thebasic skills leaving less for other aspects of educational quality&quot;,3. This attempt to distinguish between &quot;basic skills&quot; and other aspectsof &quot;quality&quot; is wholly fallacious.   As the cuts already agreed becomeeffective, there will be no aspect of education in schools which can be cutfurther without injury to those basic skills essential for work and life in anindustrial society and a competitive world.    These skills go beyondliteracy and numeracy.    They include competence in science and modernlanguages and in the whole range of skills on which further and highereducation and training have to build.4. The Queen&apos;8 Speech commitment has formed the basis of oureducation policy since we came into office.   If we now go back on it parentswill conclude that we are deliberately planning to give their children apoorer education.    The political consequences of this would be disastrous.confidential
CONFIDENTIAL5.        I urge the Cabinet to reject the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposals and toagree that the further cuts in education in England should be limited to the 20- 25 million which I have offered.M CDepartment of Education and Science22 July 19802
