CONFIDENTIALMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 3327 June 1980CABINETCOPY NO35TOP SALARIES REVIEW BODY:REPORT NUMBER 15 ON THE PAY OFMEMBERS  F PARLIAMENT AND MINISTERSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster1.       The Fifteenth Report of the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) wasdelivered to the Prime Minister on 20 June.    It recommends new ratesfor die salary and secretarial allowance of Members of Parliament (MFs),the salaries of Ministers, and Peers&apos; expenses allowance.    We need todecide whether to accept these recommendations, wholly or in part.2. A copy of Report No. 15 is at Annex A.SALARIES OF MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT3. The last TSRB Report on MPs&apos; pay (Report No 12) recrmmended asalary for MPs of  12, 000 per annum with effect from 13 June 1979, anincrease of 74 per cent over the salary then in payment.   At Cabinet on20 June 1979 (CC(79) 7th Conclusions, Minute 4) we accepted the TSRB ratebut agreed that because the increases were bo large, the new salary should,be introduced in three equal stages in June 1979, June 1980 and June 1981.The reaction of the House was so hostile that unless sime concession wasmade there was a serious danger of our proposal being defeated. Wetherefore agreed (CC(79) 8th Conclusions, Minute 5) that 50 per cent of theincrease should be paid in 1979 and the remainder in two equal stages in1980 and 1981.    This gave the following rates:13 June 1979 13 June 1980 13 June 1981 9,450  10,725  12,000(currently in payment)4. We also agreed, and I teld the House on 11 July, that the 1980 rateshould be updated in the light of recommendations by TSRB, and it wasagreed that the TSRB recommendations would be implemented by theGovernment.    Our intention to update MPs&apos; pay in 1980 has been restatedtwice: in a letter of 30 July 1979 from the Prime Minister to Lord Boyleasking TSRB to review MPs&apos; and Ministers&apos; salaries in 1980, and in astatement I made to the House on 4 March 1980, following a discussion inCabinet (CC(80) 5th Conclusions, Minute 6), in which I said that theGovernment were committed to implementing the updating from this summer.This commitment was the basis on which negotiations were carried out withthe Chairman of the 1922 Committee and representatives of the otherParliamentary parties. .CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. TSRB Report No 15 gives the Review Body recommendations onupdating*    It proposes new salary levels of:-13 June 1980 13 June 1981 12, 300  13,750This represents an increase of 14. 6 per cent on each stage which is wellbelow the increase in the  retail price index (RPI) (over 20 per cent) andin outside salaries in the relevant range (about 20 per cent) over the sameperiod.6. %ir commitment to update is quite clear.     Furthermore the sizeof the increase recommended by TSRB is comparatively modest and broadlyin line with the 14 per cent we allowed for in cash limits for increases inpublic sector pay generally.    There are some backbenchers who areanxious that Members should not award themselves a big pay increase thisyear, but given the sii-e of the recommended increase it is probablyrealistic to suppose that the majority, including many of our own supporters,will wish tb see this increase implemented.    If we attempt to avoid this IbelieVe that even though we may not face as great difficulties as we had withthe House last year, there is a very real risk of doing so and there is thecertainty of losing the goodwill of some of our own supporters for anegligible  aia.7. The normal way to announce our decision would be for me to make astatement at the time of the publication of Report No 15.    A re solutionsetting out the proposed new salary level would be subsequently laid beforethe House and debated.    Whatever aur conclusions on the pay increase, thefinal decision must be taken by the House.8. Our decisions on TSRB Report No 14 on Top Salaries have implica-tions for the handling of MPs&apos; pay, particularly as regards timing.Although there are good grounds, both in terms of our differing commitmentsand of the differently sized increases involved, for treating the two groupsdifferently, I think it would be invidious to announce first that MPs would bepermitted this increase and only later to do something more restrictive forthe TSRB 14 people.    Either both announcements should be at the sametime or that on TSRB 14 should come first.9. We have already decided and announced to the House (Hansard,4 March 1980, cols 266/7) that TSRB should be formally asked to undertakeannual reviews of Parliamentary pay and that it is the Government&apos;sintention, save in the most exceptional circumstances, that any recommenda-tions made by the Review Body will be implemented.    I propose that Ishould confirm this decision when giving the Government&apos;s views on TSRB 15.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALMINISTERS&apos; AND OTHER OFFICE HOLDERS&apos; SALARIESb.      TSRB Report No 12 recommended substantial increases forIfinisters and other office holders for payment from mid-1979. TieIncreases ranged from 50 per cent to well over 200 per cent on the salariesIhenin payment.    We decided that these increases like those for MPsIhould be staged over three years and that the 1980 stage should be updatedlor Ministers not in the Cabinet and other office holders but not for CabinetMinisters.    TSRB 15 gives recommendations on the updating.    The increasesIn this year&apos;s full recommended rates over last year&apos;s full recommendedrates are around 14-15 per cent, comparable with the increase for MPs.Towever, the position is complicated by staging.    Unlike MPs, Ministers&apos;Jsecond stage (mid-1980) salary increase resulting from the staging ofITSRB 12 recommendations is not yet in payment (an Order is required),though we have decided (CC(80) 24th Conclusions, Minute 4) to accept andimplement it.    Unless therefore we decide to make no further paymentMs year to some or all Ministers (see below) there are likely to be twodistinct increases for Ministers this year (no doubt to be provided for in asingle Order).   A table showing the salary levels for the main groups ofMinisters is attached at Annex B.    Previous incomes policies have led toplight differences in the rates for Ministers in the Commons and the Lords,the Review Body recommends removing this anomaly.11. We have given no public commitments on increasing Ministers&apos; pay.We are therefore free to consider the following options:i. to pay Boyle in full to Cabinet and junior Ministers;ii. to pay nothing in excess of the second stage which we havealready agreed;iii. to make a partial payment of the same amount (butsignificantly lower than option i.) to both groups of Ministers;iv. to make no additional payment to Cabinet Ministers but apartial payment to junior Ministers;v. to make a small partial payment to Cabinet Ministers buta larger one (or pay Beyle in full) to junior Ministers.12. Option ii. is the toughest practicable, and this would give increaseson current rates of just under 14 per cent for Cabinet Ministers, and16-18 per cent for other Ministers.   At the other end of the scale we couldpay the full updated rates (option i) - giving increases of 30 per cent or more.This would be difficult to defend publicly.    I suggest therefore that weshould go for a half-way house and for this purpose urge strongly that weshould deal more generously with our junior colleagues than with ourselves3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL(ie reject option Hi). The practical options therefore seem to me to beiv, and v. above. There is much room for argument about appropriatepercentages if we are not to implement Boyle in full; but as a basis fordiscussion I suggest the following:iv. Ml for Cabinet Ministers and 10 per cent for junior Ministersandv. 7 per cent for Cabinet Ministers and 13-15 per cent for juniorMinisters (ie slightly less than Boyle, or the full amount).13. For junior Ministers there would need to be adjustments to removethe anomaly of different salaries for Commons and Lords Ministers. Otheroffice holders should be treated similarly to junior Ministers.   Annex Cshows for the main groups of Ministers what these options mean in termsof rates of &apos;&apos;ncrease.14. Ministers in the House of Commons also receive a Parliamentarysalary.   Because of the effects of the previous Government&apos;s incomespolicy, there are currently three rates (all of which include the secondstage):  6,130 for Cabinet Ministers,  6, 325 for Ministers not in theCabinet; and  6, 4x0 for junior Ministers.    TSRB 15 recommends a unifiedrate.   Taking account of the staging of last year&apos;s increase, the ratesrecommended are:13 June 1980 13 June 1981 7, 325  8,000I propose that we treat this salary in exactly the same way as we decide totreat MPs&apos; i*ay.PENSIONS15. If we decide to pay something less than the TSRB recommendedrates, then I propose that we should follow past practice and promulgatethe full rate for pension purposes.ALLOWANCES16. TSRB consider that the current rate of  6, 750 for MPs&apos; secretarialand research assistance allowance is no longer enough to provide for a full-time secretary and a part-time research assistant.    They recommend anew rate of  8, 000 per annum - an 18 per cent increase.    They alsorecommend the following increases in the daily rates for Peers&apos; expensesallowance:4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALi. overnight subsistence: from  18.50 to  23.00;ii. day subsistence and incidental travel: from  9- 00 to  11.00;iii. secretarial costs, postage, etc: from  8.50 to  10.00.Finally they recommend that the amount Ministers and other paid officeholders in the House of Lords may ciaim for secretarial expenses shouldincrease from  1, 000 to  1,175 per year.17. Increases in these allowances are unlikely to be controversial andthey are justified by increased costs.    I propose that we accept TSRB&apos;srecommendations,    I also propose that we invite TSRB to review annuallythe secretarial allowance for MPs.    This allowance has in fact beenincreased annually since 1974 and asking TSRB to examine it each yearmerely regularises the position.CONCLUSIONS18. I invite the Cabinet to consider wheiher:i. the recommendations in TSRB Report No 15 on MPs&apos; salaryshould be accepted by the Government and, subject to the views ofthe House of Commons, implemented;ii. the Government&apos;s views should be made public whenReport No 15 is published and at the same time an announcementof annual reviews of Parliamentary pay by TSRB should be made;iii. the pay of Ministers and other office holders should beincreased according to one of the options set out in paragraphs 12and 13 of this paper;iv. where we decide that any salary should be paid at less thanthe TSRB recommended rates, the full rate should be promulgatedfor pension purposes;v. the TSRB recommendations on MPs&apos; secretarial and researchassistance allowance, Peers&apos; expenses allowance and the secretarialallowance for Ministers and other paid office holders in the House ofLords should be accepted and implemented;vi. TSRB should be invited to review annually the secretarialallowance for MPs.N St J SPrivy Council Office27 June 1980CONFIDENTIAL

confidentialSTERS OF THE CROWN AND MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENTBroductionIn 1979 we carried out our third review of the remuneration of Members of1iament and Ministers and other paid office holders.   Report No 12 containedrecommendations on the salary of Members and the salaries of Ministers andr office holders, and our views on the closely related issue of salarys&apos;.   It also covered the Peers&apos; expenses allowance and included an interimmmendation on the amount against which claims could be made against the MP&apos;s2etarial allowance.   In Report No 13   we completed our review of the maximumhe secretarial allowance and dealt with a number of other allowances and&quot;lities, including the maximum of the allowance for research assistance andParliamentary pension scheme.The levels of the salaries and allowances recommended in Report No 12 were^pted by the Government as appropriate at 13   June 1979, but the salariesrendix A) are being introduced in three stages:   one half of the increase wasLemented with effect from 13 June 1979 and the remainder in two equal instal-ts, the first from 13 June 1980 and the second from 13 June 1981&quot;^.   The otherwmendations were accepted, but in some cases in a significantly modified form,jrt No 13 had recommended two allowances with separate maxima to enable Membersanploy both full-time secretarial assistance and part-time research assistance,pe maxima have been combined to provide an allowance with a single maximum,&quot;nst which claims may be made for expenditure incurred on secretarial assistanceon research assistance.   Parliament decided that a further amount should bej available to Members for payments into an approved scheme to provide pensionssecretaries and research assistants.   Another departure from our recommendationscted the severance payments for MPs.   We recommended a scale of payments designedassist the older and longer-serving Member; in the event, the payments that wenunended have been doubled.

rrent reviewconfidential|5n this occasion we have been asked to bring up to date by the usual Reviewrocess the second stage payment of our 1979 recommendations on the salariesbers, Ministers and other paid office holders.   We have not been askedfically to bring up to date any of the Parliamentary allowances but weler some adjustments are desirable.   Although the recommendations in Reporton the maxima of the secretarial and research allowances were put forwarduary of this year, they were calculated in June 1979 terms.   In passing,Id explain that the maximum recommended for the research assistance allowancetended to provide part-time assistance.   We always envisaged that bothneed to be brought up to date in future reviews and we have in consequence[iered it right now to review again what is now the single maximum for secre-and research assistance.   We have also brought up to date the maxima ofements within the Peers&apos; expenses allowance and the maximum of the allowancecretarial expenses available to Ministers and other paid office holders inuse of Lords.ary of Members of Parliamente have given a great deal of thought to the level of salary that would beriate to Members of Parliament in the light of developments since our last|w.   In Report No 12 we recommended a salary of  12,000.   The second stageactually being paid is  10,725.   The question we have to answer is by howhe figure of  12,000 should now be increased, as the basis of calculatione revised salary that would be appropriate with effect from 13 June 1980.ing the period June 1979 to June 1980, the Retail Price Index has risenr 20 per cent.   We have not, however, seen our task in terms of any form ofindex link.   Our evidence of the increases in salaries in the relevantis that they have also risen during this period by about 20 per cent..

In our judgment,  taking all relevant factors into account, the salary appropriate at 13is  13,750, and on this basis the second stage salary would be  12,300&quot;.th effect from that date.     The figure of  13,750 represents an increase of|6 per cent above our 1979 recommendation of  12,000; an increase substantiallyelow both the increase in the RPI and in relevant salaries elsewhere.myrliamentary salary of Ministers and paid office holders in the House of Commonsmm Ministers and other office holders in the House of Commons receive ajrliamentary salary in recognition of their responsibility to their constituentsttinct from their Ministerial or other responsibilities.   In Report No 12, weended that it should be increased to  7,000.   We now recommend that theiJpmentary salary appropriate at 13 June I98O should be  8,000 and that itbuld again be brought up to date on 13 June I98I.   Because of the way in whichevious increases have been implemented, there are currently three differentevels in payment:  6,130,  6,325 and  6,410.   We recommend that, with effect fromHie I98O, the Parliamentary salary for all Ministers in the House of Commonsould be  7,325.cretarial allowance and research assistance allowancemm We recommended in Report No 12 that the maximum for the secretarial allowanceould be increased to  5,500 to enable those Members who need to employ a full-ime secretary to do so.   We also recommended a separate maximum for an allowanceI provide for the employment of a part-time research assistant.   On the initiativeI Parliament these recommended maxima have since been combined to provide a singleimum sum, at present  6,750, which is available for both secretarial and researchosts, together with general office expenses.   This combined maximum is in our viewlonger enough to provide both for the employment of a full-time secretary,eluding the national insurance contributions payable by the Member, and alsoe employment of a part-time research assistant.   On the assumption that Parliamentishes to continue to provide a single maximum we recommend that this should becreased to  8,000.3confidential
