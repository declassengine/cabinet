CONFIDENTIALORTH REPORT ON TOP SALARIESER 1 MBRODUCTIONe backgroundThis report completes our fourth review of the four groups within ouranding terms of reference since we were appointed in 1971    Our first reviews carried out in the period from 1972 to 197^   during which we also putrward three interim reports.   Our second, and most recent, major review wasp2i 1977-78     The salaries that we recommended then were those that wensidered appropriate at 1 April 1978.   The Government accepted our recommenda-ons but decided that the increases should be implemented in three stages:per cent from 1 January 1978, one half of the balance from 1 April 1979 d the remainder from 1 April 1980.   We recommended that, should the increasesstaged, the recommended salaries should be kept up to date by the normalView process through the staging period.   The Government gave no commitmentthis respect.   We concluded nevertheless that it would be right for us todertake a further review with the limited objective of establishing the&apos;creases necessary to bring up to date the second stage of our recommendedApril 1978 salary levels at 1 April 1979.   This   e did in our Report No 11 .The recommendations in Report No 11 (set out in Appendix A) were acceptedthe Government.   The salaries implemented from 1 April 1979 were those alreadyIpayment prior to those recommendations (that is, the second stage of the:reases recommended in Report No 10 as appropriate at 1 April 1978) plus thefference in each case between the salary recommended as appropriate atApril 1978 and the 1 April 1979 salary recommended in Report No 11. Thepal stage of the increases recommended in Report No 10 has now been implementedth effect from 1 April 1980.   We again emphasised our concern that thepletion of the staging process on 1 April 1980 should result in salaryels that were appropriate at that date.   Provided that the recommendationsthis report are implemented this objective will have been fulfilled.eview Body on Top Salaries, Report No 6: Report on Top Salaries - Cmnd 58^6.eview Body on Top Salaries, Report No 10: Second Report on Top Salaries - Cmnd 7253eview Body on Top Salaries, Report No 11: Third Report on Top Salaries. - Cmnd 7576.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALScope of present review3.      In our 1979 review our main purpose was to bring up to date the secondstage of our 1 April 1978 recommendations and we envisaged then that we wouldneed to consider certain structural problems this year.   Meanwhile, in the lasttwelve months we have undertaken a review of Parliamentary remuneration andallowances, as well as the 1979 updating of the third stage of our 1978recommendations.   The work on the Parliamentary review inevitably had aneffect on the timing of the present review.   Consequently, at the outset wehad to choose between two courses:   we could undertake a comprehensive reviewof all the groups within our remit, recognising that this would entail aninterim report and a final report;   alternatively, we could undertake a morelimited review, closer to the one that we carried out in 1979*k.       In practice, we have steered a middle course.   Our initial consultationsindicated that the overall salaries structure recommended in Report No 10 andmaintained in Report No 11 was still regarded as appropriate.   However, as ourwork proceeded it became clear that certain structural problems had becomepressing and needed to be looked at immediately.   What we have done thereforeis to concentrate on those problems that we judge to be in need of urgentattention, recognising that we will have the opportunity to take a close looknext year at the overall structure.5. We now indicate the range of this review in greater detail, by referenceto the four areas covered by our terms of reference.   The most urgent problemthat we have had to tackle is the pay relationship between those covered byour terms of reference and those immediately below.   There is now a good dealof compression of differentials and some overlap at these levels.   The scaleand the causes differ both from one group to another and, in the case of thenationalised industries, within the group.Chairmen and members of nationalised industry Boards6. Our recommendations regarding the salaries of the Chairmen and membersof nationalised industry Boards have been the subject of much recent speculation,and some people have questioned whether the pay of Chairmen and Board membersshould remain within our terms of reference.   We ourselves share these doubts,for a combination of reasons.7. We have been very much aware of the growing difficulty, both conceptuallyand in practice, of reconciling a &apos;Review Body1 approach with a &apos;market rate&apos;2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpproach.   In our Report No 6 of 197** , whilst we acknowledged the need foralaries in the nationalised industries to be sufficiently attractive to enablethem to recruit and retain Board members of the necessary quality, neverthelesstie concluded that salaries in these industries should not equal the highestsalaries paid in the private sector for jobs of a similar weight.   But by 1978e felt we should accord added significance to the growing indications that&quot;management is all the time becoming more mobile&quot;, and we laid particular stresson increased mobility between industry at home and industry abroad.   The clearimplication of Report No 10 was that economic circumstances were already makinga &apos;Review Body1 approach to top salaries within the nationalised industries moredifficult to justify.8. In addition there is the new factor, more relevant than ever before, ofthe declared policies of Her Majesty&apos;s Government.   Concern about inflation hasalways made it unrealistic to suppose that decisions about top salaries couldbe taken right outside the matrix of politics.   But the new factor is the deter-mination of the present Government in individual cases, as shown by the recentexample of the British Steel Corporation, to &apos;let the market rate decide&apos;. Inour view, if market forces are to become the overriding determinant, then theresponsibility for settling the salaries of Chairmen and Board members ofnationalised industries, and for keeping these salaries up to date, would restmore easily with Ministers than as part of our terms of reference.9. Lastly, there is the element of illogicality in the present systemthat, partly for historical reasons, some public sector industries are outsideour terms of reference.    This must in itself result in inconsistencies ofapproach.   Quite apart from the special circumstances surrounding the recentappointment of the Chairman of the British Steel Corporation, it is hard to seethe logic of an arrangement which requires us to recommend on the salaries paidby, say, Regional Water Authorities and Area Electricity Boards whilst excludingBritish Leyland and Rolls Royce.10. These doubts have not led us to take the decisive step, on this occasion,of declining to make further recommendations for this part of our remit. Butwe would urge the Government to think carefully about our precise terms ofreference in this area, and to decide to what extent, if any, a Review Bodyapproach is still appropriate.   When we were set up in 1971  the economic andmanagerial climate, both nationally and internationally, was significantly morelocalised than it has since become.Review Body on Top Salaries, Report No 6: Report on Top Salaries   Cmnd 50M-6(paragraph 115)  3CONFIDENTIAL

In our earlier reports, we have explained the principles upon which ourSary recommendations for the highest levels of the civil service are based.Bey are not identical to those that underlie negotiated salaries for the grades  to and including the Assistant Secretary that are below our remit. NorHeed did the Royal Commission on the Civil Service propose in 1955 that theydiould be.   Like the Priestley Commission, we place less reliance on directdtside comparisons, although we see them as having a significant part to play.II has always been our view that such comparisons become progressively lessBpropriate at the highest levels .

The reason for this is that our 1978 recommendations for the Majorral have continued to be staged, whereas fully up to date military salariesBrigadiers were introduced with effect from 1 April 1979.   The second andted problem is the relationship between the military salary of the Brigadierhe medical and dental branches of the Services and the pay of the Majorral.   These problems depend for their resolution on the implementation ofcurrent recommendations.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER 2OtMAPPROACH AND GENERAL INQUIRIESOurjobjectives21|1 Our main objective is to recommend the salaries that we consider appropriateforleach of the appointments within our remit.   A convenient starting point is toestablish what has been happening&apos; in the private sector.   As we have said, therelejrance of direct comparisons with the rates of pay and conditions of servicein the private sector does however differ as between the four groups within ourterms of reference.   They are clearly the major consideration in making judgmentson appropriate salaries for Chairmen and members of nationalised industry Boards.These cannot be far out of line with rewards in the private sector if the nationa-lised industries are to recruit and retain the people of the quality and calibreneeded to manage some of the largest and technologically most complex industriesin |e country, indeed in the world.   Movement between the public and private sectorsis to be welcomed, but unless salaries are broadly comparable, the movement will bein one direction only.   Traditional loyalties and a sense of public service havein the past helped the nationalised industries to retain top management even whensalaries have been thoroughly out of date and uncompetitive, but this cannot beexpelted to continue.22. Comparison with remuneration in the private sector has an important partto play in reaching judgments on the pay of the other three groups in our remit,but account has also to be taken of the relative attractiveness of other aspectsof a;career.   This includes the way in which the total remuneration package ismadelip, the overall prospects of promotion, job satisfaction, job security anddifferences in accountability and in responsibility for final decision taking.It is against this background that judgments have to be made of the salaries thatwillpttract and retain people of the necessary professional quality to the topleve4 of the judiciary, of the civil service and of the armed forces.23. 1 In pursuing these objectives we have again considered the value that oughtto be attributed to pensions arrangements, particularly the inflation-proofingprovisions that apply in the public services generally.   We have also examinedagain.our approach to the evaluation of fringe benefits, including cars, that areavailable outside.   We discuss this in some detail in Chapter 5  in relation tothe senior grades of the civil service, but we want to make clear that we havefoll ed the same approach for each of the groups covered by this review.8CONFIDENTIAL
eys conducted for this review CONFIDENTIALThree surveys have been carried out on our behalf, two of which were related toific parts of our remit.   The first was a survey designed to establish the extenttie compression in the nationalised industries between salaries at Board level andenior managers below.   The second was a survey of those appointed to the HightBench in the last three years to establish the level of earnings in years priorppointment, as a measure of the immediate financial loss at the time of appoint-. The results of these two surveys are referred to in Chapter 3 (nationalisedBtries) and in Chapter k (the Higher Judiciary).   An analysis of the survey ofpession in the nationalised industries is in Appendix B.The third survey was of remuneration in the private sector at levels ofnsibility broadly comparable to those with which we are concerned. Theeration of the posts in the survey ranged from well below to well above the levels^numeration of the posts in our remit, giving average pay for posts in theyof  22,100 (1 January 1979) compared with the average salary of  20,300,on the rates recommended for 1 April 1979 in Report No 11, for the posts inemit.  To some extent, directly or indirectly, the results of this survey areant to all the four groups within our remit.   They are discussed therefore inchapter.   The survey followed the same pattern as the limited survey undertakenyear.   Information was collected on levels of remuneration current at 1 Januarythat is salary plus bonus, commission and profit sharing payments and alsod changes since 1 January 1979*   It did not include data on superannuationits or on fringe benefits for top appointments.   We always have to balance ouragainst the demands that they impose on those who co-operate so generously inurveys.  Without their co-operation our work would be immeasurably more difficult,is occasion, we decided that we should assume that overall there had been noficant change since our last major review in 1977-78 in the relative degree ofsion of other benefits as between the public and private sectors at the levelswhich we are concerned.   Nevertheless, a limited survey has serious disadvantagest is already clear that in 1981 more up-to-date information on all aspects ofotal remuneration package   will be needed.The survey sample contained 122 private sector organisations compared with 120 iny 1979 and 328 in September 1977.

However we have made our recommendations on thission on the basis of all the evidence available to us.   The fact that wedone so should not be taken to imply that the doubts expressed in Chapter 1t our future role in relation to nationalised industry Board salaries arey way reduced.   It is our belief that, where salaries are subject to^pendent review, problems can be kept to a minimum provided that the reviewsregular and the recommendations that emerge from them are implemented promptly.ve expressed this view in the context of our recent review of Parliamentary1eration .

Instead, our 1978 recommendations were implemented in three stages -0 per cent with effect from 1 January 1978 and the second and third stagesith effect from 1 April 1979 and 1 April 1980.   The 1 January 1978 increaseor the nationalised industries was 10 per cent on salary levels that, apartrom supplements under the counter-inflation measures of the day amounting tolittle over  1,000, were still those that had been accepted as appropriaten an interim basis only at 1 January 1972.   For the other three groups, byontrast, the increase was based on the levels recommended in Report No 6 foranuary 1975&gt; or at least on salaries that represented partial progress towardshose recommendations.2. Many of the problems that have arisen as regards salaries at Board leveld senior management level immediately below in the nationalised industries inecent years are direct or indirect consequences of the discriminatory actiongainst this group over the last decade.   We cannot emphasise too strongly thathis must not be allowed to happen again and that it is essential that thesealaries be kept regularly up to date.vidence for this reviewThe great majority of the industries within our remit have submittedxtensive written evidence.   We have also had a series of illuminating and helpfuliscussions with a number of individual industries, with their &apos;sponsor&apos;epartments and with the Civil Service Department.   Those who gave oral evidence0 us covered a wide range of problems and made proposals for their resolution...ese proposals fall into three groups.   The first concerns the general levelf salaries in the nationalised industries and the limitations on the flexibilityn the present system to match remuneration against the responsibilities beingarried, both at Board level and below.   The second relates to the position ofndividual industries in the present structure.   A number of industries arguedhat the span or complexity of their activities, or their vulnerability toorapetition for top management from the private sector both in this country andnternationally required that the industry be put in a higher &apos;tier&apos; and thusReview Body on Top Salaries, Report No 10:   Second Report on Top Salaries-Cmnd 7253.12CONFIDENTIAL

The third is made up of proposalsfecting the conditions under which Board members are employed and, inticular, the way in which the range pay system for Board members isministered at present.inciplesWe remain of the view that salaries in nationalised industries have toj competitive with rewards in the private sector.   Management is becomingcreasingly mobile.   Account must be taken of the degree to which an industryin competition for senior managers and Board members.   The job of a ChairmanBoard member of a nationalised industry is not the same as the job of anposite number in a private sector organisation.   Some of the constraints ande pressures are different.   They are not, however, any less and we are satis-ed that the jobs are in general of comparable difficulty and weight.There is one point that we would emphasise.   Although it is undoubtedlyth necessary and valuable on occasion to recruit people with appropriateerience from outside a particular industry, it would be an unsatisfactoryuation if this were to become the normal practice.   Individual nationalisedustries have a well developed career structure which in many cases can leadappointment to the Board.   It is extremely important in our view to ensuret this continues and that other nationalised industries should be in a position,rever possible, to adopt a policy of developing their own top management,s is important not only from the point of view of the quality of top managementthe commitment such a policy engenders within an organisation, but also inucing the need to rely on the ability to attract talent from the private sectordirect competition with the level of rewards available in that sector.We also stress that the arrangements for particular industries need tosufficiently flexible to cope with changing circumstances.

We deal first with Board members.j.     The weight of responsibility of individual members of a Board may varyely.   The salary range should provide for this, in addition to what is neededallow for difference in performance, which we discuss below (paragraph 59)  therefore propose a modest increase in the span of the available ranges pendingfurther examination of the issue.   In extending the ranges, we emphasise thatis not our intention to imply that individuals should be moved automaticallya the position that they now occupy in the existing range to the equivalent^ition in the new range.   Instead, we see it as appropriate for each Chairmandetermine the new position in the range in accordance with the criteria under&apos;ch the range is administered.We have always recognised that, in most of the organisations with whichare concerned, there will be some posts in addition to the Chairman&apos;s whichry a heavier responsibility than can properly be accommodated within thege for the Board member.   It is this need for a three-tier Board salariesucture that has led us in the past to recommend an intermediate range foreputy Chairman or equivalent.The Deputy Chairman range is intended to remunerate those who have ana of responsibility for which they are fully &apos;second-in-command&apos;.   In our16CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL1idance in Report No 11   we sought to make clear that, while the Deputyairman range should normally be used for a single appointment, we did notle out the possibility that a large nationalised industry might have anganisational structure that required an equal division of the &apos;second-in-inmand&apos; responsibilities.   The evidence put to us on this occasion has satisfiedthat, in a limited number of industries, there is .justification for more thano appointments to be remunerated in the Deputy Chairman range.We have also considered whether additional flexibility is needed at Chairmanvel.  Unlike Deputy Chairmen and  Board members, in the great majority of cases,e Chairman is paid a flat rate and not within a range.   Yet the qualificiationseded for a particular post can vary over a period, as can the qualificationseded for particular appointments and the organisation from which individualse recruited.   In consequence, the salary required to attract suitable candidatesthe same nationalised industry may change from one appointment to the next,range would provide scope for determining the salary most appropriate at theme of appointment.|.      Alternatively Government should be in a position to offer a higher salaryan that normally accruing to the post when there is a clear need to do so,thout disrupting the overall structure.   We consider that for those industriesthin our remit that fall within the top three tiers of the structure, up toper cent more   than the normal salary recommended for each Chairman shouldavailable where it is judged to be in the national interest to attract a rticular type of experience.

It is for these reasonsMat we consider that the British National Oil Corporation should retain itsfcition at the top of the structure.50.

We endorse the salary decision taken in October 1979 on an interimBis and we recommend that the Board should continue to be included in the samerap as the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.We have been impressed by the changing nature of the work of the Britishisport Docks Board, particularly with regard to its expanded role as an employerdock labour and the need for the Board to remain competitive with other port;horities in relation to top management needs.   We recommend that it be includedthe same &apos;tier&apos; as the Scottish Development Agency.   We were also impressedthe weight of responsibility carried by the Chairman of the National Watericil, because of the particular constitution of the NWC.   It merits someissessment and again we would recommend that it should be moved into the sameier&apos; as the SDA.   We do not consider that the two Electricity Boards for Scotlandmid continue to be treated equally for salary purposes.   The South of Scotlandsctricity Board is now much the larger of the two and carries greater responsi-ities than the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board.In fitting the Crown Agents into the existing structure, we have taken accountI the fact that it does not have a monopoly but is heavily dependent upon thefeiness it can secure from overseas governments.   We have had regard to the[sting salary levels and the extent to which they have enabled the Crown Agentsattract and retain suitably qualified staff.   We recommend inclusion in theie &apos;tier&apos; as the Commonwealth Development Corporation.We have considered the position of the Highlands and Islands Developmentrd.  It is smaller than the Scottish Development Agency and the Welsh Develop-t Agency, but it has a wide range of responsibilities and the Chairman is bqthef Executive and Accounting Of ficer.   We recommend that it should also be includedthe same &apos;tier&apos; as the Commonwealth Development Corporation. *18CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALWe have considered whether some change is necessary in the relativeitions of the Electricity Council and the Central Electricity Generatingd. It has been suggested to us that the weight of the current responsibilities,ked by their respective statutory positions, would justify at least equaling for salary purposes between the Board and the Council.   However, we haveo been told in evidence that it is the Government&apos;s present intention that thectricity Council should have a greater overall responsibility for the industrybe secured by informal means rather than by legislation.   We understand thatsultations. on these arrangements are still in progress and we therefore do notpose major change in the position of the Council or of the CEGB within theucture.   The relationship may however have to be looked at again when newangements have been introduced and when it is possible to judge how they haveked in practice.An allied problem is the position of the Area Electricity Boards. Theirmen of these Boards are statutory appointments and this is why they comehin our terms of reference.   They are however unique in that, alone of theustries for which we are responsible, their appointments are career appoint-ts made from within the industry.   The relationship between the salaries ofirmen and those reporting to them is therefore critical.   The equivalentointments in the gas industry are outside our remit.   We find ourselves ineement with those who have argued that the Area Electricity Boards shouldremoved from our remit; but while they remain within it, it is our duty toe recommendations for these appointments.   As we have explained (paragraphs36), our view of appropriate salaries for these posts is formed against widerteria than the need for an adequate salary differential between the Chairmanthose reporting to him.inistration of present system of remunerationIt has again been put to us that Board salaries should be removed fromect Ministerial control and therefore from our terms of reference, and shoulddetermined either by the Chairman or, in the case of executive Board members,the non-executive Board members.

CONFIDENTIALSome changes are however desirable.   We would like to refer first to twor matters that do not fall directly within our terms of reference. Theitions under which a Board member may be appointed, dismissed or not re-inted can constitute a serious deterrent to a senior manager to acceptance ofership of the Board of his industry.   We endorse the view put to us injlence that full-time Board members should have the benefit of service contractsh include adequate notice of the renewal or termination of appointments .contract should extend to the question of re-employment as a senior executiveompensation where a Board appointment is not renewed.Next, the way in which the present range pay system is operated has beenicised in two particular respects.   The first is the current requirement,ithstanding our earlier recommendations, that within an industry the averageid-points of individual ranges should not exceed the mid-point of the overalle recommended for that industry.   The second is the requirement, likewise,progress through the individual ranges should normally be at the rate of oneBth of the range for each year of service.   The first of these, the &apos;averaging1, has caused widespread difficulties - particularly in those industries with aBoard members only.   The &apos;rule&apos; governing progression through the range isrally regarded within the industries as contrary to the spirit of a pay systemEted to performance and incompatible with the normal five year contract foronalised industry Board members.We have in previous reports recommended full and flexible use of thegges to allow industries to meet particular recruitment and retention needs,to enable achievement to be recognised.   While the present arrangementsa marked improvement on those which they replaced, they do not provide theee of flexibility that we envisaged.   Here, the way in which our recommen-[ions have been put into effect acts as a constraint on organisational needs,latere have a statutory responsibility for the salaries of Board members andneed for some form of external control remains.   But it should not be appliedla way that thwarts the main intention of the scheme when it was introduced -h was to provide Board members with an incentive to perform well and tod them accordingly.   That stage appears to have been reached and weimoend that changes in the detailed rules should be made to provide greateribility.   In particular, we are of the view that the small size of someQrds makes &apos;rules&apos; on the spread of Board members&apos; salaries through the rangeeview Body on Top Salaries , Report No 6: Report on Top Salaries - Cmnd 5846paragraph 121).20CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpropriate and virtually unworkable.   We also consider that in the future thepern should enable the fact to be recognised that most Board members reach,ome close to, their optimum performance after three years.   In some cases| performance, combined with job weight, will justify a position at the tophe range.   We would emphasise, once again, that progression through thee ought not to be on an &apos;incremental&apos; basis but should be determined primarily^Individual merit.Another proposal put to us in the course of this review is .that a full-Board member who is also a part-time member of another Board should be|&gt;wed to retain any fee income accrued from the part-time post.   At present11-time Board member is normally allowed to retain fees of up to a total1,000 from any outside appointments considered either directly beneficialis full-time work, or of no possible disadvantage to that work.   In Report1J|6 we proposed that once the salaries we recommended had been implemented,d members should not retain fees from outside appointments.   We haveidered this matter again and we remain convinced that retention of suchm is not justified provided that the salaries for Board members in nationalisedLstries are kept up-to-date.Our attention has also been drawn to one other proposal, namely that BoardDers based in London should receive London weighting.   The broad principle wes followed in the civil service and the armed forces is that above a certainel the great majority of posts will be found in London and that, in thesecumstances, it is more appropriate to recommend a basic salary that takesount of that fact.   This we have done for Deputy Secretaries and above incivil service, and equivalent ranks in the armed forces.   We 6ee no reasondepart from this precept in looking at salaries for nationalised industries.ommendationsWe recommend the salaries below as appropriate with effect from 1 AprilD. In each case they are salaries for full-time appointments.   These increasesseem high, but we would point out that they are essential if the pay to thoseposts below Board level is not to exceed that of Board members to whom they areoneible.    Part-time Board members should be paid pro-rata according to theunt of time given, subject to a minimum payment of  2,750.eview Body on Top Salaries, Report No 6: Report on Top Salaries - Cmnd 5846paragraph 106).21CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER hTHE HIGHER JUDICIARY AND CERTAIN OTHER JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS63.   The judicial structure is the most complex of the four that fall withinour standing terms of reference.   We examined it thoroughly in our major reviewsin 1972-74 and in 1977-78.   We have received no evidence to suggest that thestructure we recommended in 1978 has proved unsatisfactory in practice, or nolonger meets up-to-date needs.   We have had however a number of proposalsfor individual changes.   Although they affect relatively few appointmentsthey have had implications for the overall structure and we have examinedthem.   Therefore while the main result of this review is to bring existingsalaries up to date we have also been able to consider in a preliminary waya number of wider changes, which we intend to look at again, in greater depth,in our next review.   We should note that we were invited to include within ourremit, for the first time, the County Court Registrars and District Registrarsof the High Court.The extent of our inquiries6k.  Up-to-date information on the level of barristers* earnings has been essentialparticularly for those groups of barristers from which appointments are madeto the parts of the judiciary with which we are concerned.   For the 1972-7^review, a survey of earnings at the Bar was carried out directly on our behalf;in 1978 we were able to make use of surveys which had been carried out by theBar Councils in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland, and by the Facultyof Advocates in Scotland for the two Royal Commissions on Legal Services.Surveys of this kind rely heavily upon the co-operation of individual barristers.They are an additional burden which we are always reluctant to impose and whichwe consider to be justified only by a clear need.   We concluded that the limitednature of our review made a full survey of this kind unnecessary this year.65. Instead we concentrated our efforts on obtaining information on the levelof remuneration given up by those who are appointed to the High Court Bench.All High Court Judges appointed within the last three years have co-operatedin a survey of their earnings at the Bar in years prior to appointment tothe Bench and we are grateful to them.   The object was two-fold: to obtain ameasure of the financial sacrifice involved in acceptance of an appointmentto the Bench and to help in forming a judgment on the appropriate level ofsalary for a High Court Judge after taking into account all aspects of23CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALenumeration and the status of the appointment.   Inevitably, the informationbtained was to some extent out of date and we have made some allowance bydjusting remuneration received in the earlier years to 1978-79 prices.6. An undertaking was given that individual returns would be treated intrictest confidence.   We do not, therefore, include the detailed resultsf this survey in this report.   Table C below, which contains a summary ofhe replies, has been compiled from information on receipts for the financialears 1975-76 to 1978-79 converted where necessary to 1978-79 prices.   It islear from the table that a substantial financial sacrifice is made by manyn moving from the Bar to the High Court Bench.   Moreover, the reductionIn income, and therefore in standard of living, occurs at a time of lifehen an improvement is to be expected in many professions.

There are however some signs thatn increasing number of barristers particularly those earning the highest&apos;.ncomeB prefer to remain at the Ear.   The numbers are still small but we woulduggest that they are significant and underline the need for judicial salarieso remain compatible with the status and duties of office and the need to attracthe best candidates to the Bench in the various categories and to retain them,e have had this point in mind especially in our recommendation   for High Courtudges.roposals for change18. We have received a number of proposals for modificiations to the judicialtructure in the course of this review.   Our attitude to all of these proposalsas been influenced by our desire to reduce the unusually large number of salaryevels within the &apos;top&apos; judicial structure.   One of our objectives since weere first appointed has been to rationalise*, and streamline the structure,e greater the number of different levels of appointment, the more difficult its to maintain differentials that are more than merely symbolic.   There aretructural matters upon which we shall need extensive evidence to test thefeasibility of our ideas and which we propose to leave until our next review,ere are however a few changes that we consider immediately necessary, thate not inconsistent with the aim of simplification and that can be achieved nowjithout disrupting the remainder of the present structure.j9. We consider that it is no longer justifiable for the President of thepansport Tribunal, the Chief National Insurance Commissioner and the Presidentf Industrial Tribunals (England and Wales) to receive less than the Presidentfthe Lands Tribunal (England and Wales).   We propose therefore that all fourppointments should in future carry the same salary.D.  The second change affects the Senior and Chief Masters and Registrarsfthe Supreme Court.   We no longer consider that the level of these appoint-ents in the structure adequately recognises the responsibilities involved.j consider that it would now be appropriate therefore for Senior and Chiefsters and Registrars to be included in the group of appointments which includese Circuit Judges.   We also consider that the responsibilities of the Masterthe Court of Protection and the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appealstify their inclusion in the same group.25CONFIDENTIAL

As Districtpgistrars their jurisdiction extends over all three Divisions of the Highpurt, and in that capacity it is similar to that of the Supreme Court Mastersd Registrars.   But they are not specialists and, in the event, we considereir responsibilities to be rather less than the Masters and Registrars. Asunty Court Registrars their jurisdiction is mainly confined (apart from&quot;vorce) to the limited pecuniary jurisdiction of the County Court.   On the otherd we cannot but be impressed by the variety of their work and by the pressuresd skills involved.

We have continued to adopt two basic criteria in assessing salaries. First,at they should be reasonable compared to what is available outside the civilrvice for like weight of responsibility, bearing in mind differences in conditionsemployment and in remuneration other than pay.   Secondly, that they should formt of a coherent salary structure for the civil service as a whole.. Between 1 January 1980 and 1 April 1980, there was an overlap of  286 betweene maximum of the scale for Assistant Secretary, which is negotiated, and theder Secretary rate.   The immediate cause of the overlap was the Governmentcision to implement the increases recommended in Report No 10 in three stages,yment of the third stage being deferred until 1 April 1980.   However, it isear that the underlying relationship between the pay of the two grades issatisfactory.   We have therefore re-examined the methods we have used up tov in order to consider whether any change in our approach is called for. Weinto greater detail below (paragraphs 79-82), but make three immediate points., The first is that the very fact of an &apos;interface&apos; between two different systemsr determining the pay of grades at different levels of responsibility is liablecause difficulties.   These can arise precisely because of the underlyingfferences that have led to the establishment of two systems.. The second is that the higher one goes up the civil service structure, theder it becomes to make direct comparisons and therefore the greater the need fordependent review. To the extent that outside comparisons have a part to play accountat be taken not only of the relative value of the other items apart from salary inenumeration outside, but also of other aspects of employment that are truly unquanti-iable.  An alternative approach would be to await the outcome, each year, of theAs at 1 January 1980.28CONFIDENTIAL

However, wealso consistently expressed doubts about their direct relevance and adequacy fopurpose of comparing levels of remuneration in the public and private sectors.^he value of a pension that is fully index-linked can be expected to be higherthose close to retirement.   It is therefore pertinent that those within ourt will be either in mid-career, or in the later stages of a career.   This doesmean, however, that the allowance for full index-linking should be greatermatically than the allowance made for the other grades.   Other factors have toaken into account.   The first is the difference between the salaries paid insideoutside the civil service for jobs of equal weight and responsibility takingunt of the normal life expectancy on retirement.   Those now in the most seniorjtione will have made a notional contribution to their pension during their earlierb of employment in the civil service.   Differences in the rate of accrual areimportant.   In the civil service the standard period of service required tofy for a full pension is      years.

We anticipate that this will continue to be the pattern in the future,th a major examination every three years supplemented in the interveningars by a limited salaries survey.. The provision of a car continues to be the single most valuable benefitailable to those at equivalent levels outside the public services.   We noted1earlier reports   that the provision of a car at top management levels was ammon feature and have no evidence to suggest that the incidence of provisions increased at these levels or that there has been a significant increase in&apos;e value of the benefit provided as a proportion of total remuneration. Howeverere is considerable evidence that the provision of a car has become ancreasingly important feature of remuneration at lower levels in the privatector.  This has had a significant effect on the salaries of those appointmentsthe public sector that are immediately below our remit and has thereforejded to the &apos;interface* problems to which we have referred.

As we have said before   we see such comparisons as aSuable and necessary part of the process of making judgments on pay at thesevels but as one element only.   Other factors continue to be relevant, includingp security and job satisfaction, as well as differences in pension provisionsprovision of fringe benefits.   They also include the need for a coherentstructure for the civil service as a whole.   The compression and overlapfe occured in the nationalised industries at Board level and below has beend by the compression between the maximum of the Assistant Secretary salaryd the Under Secretary.   We regard it as important to relieve the compressionlists, but we also consider it important that the solution should not bed simply by boosting the salaries for which we are responsible without[regard to all other relevant considerations.recommend the following salaries as appropriate at 1 April 1980. the Home Civil Service )nt Secretary to the Treasury )~y to the Cabinet )37,000nt Secretary3^,000Permanent Secretary31,000Secretary27,000ecretary23,500Body on Top Salaries, Report No 6:   Report on Top Salaries  - Cmnd 5846.aph 57).31CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTEE 6IOE OFFICERS IN THE ARMED FORCES. We discussed in Report No 6 the particular pay principles that we saw as&apos;plicable to the circumstances of senior officers in the armed forces in additionthe general principles applicable across the four groups within our remit.|th the help of an Advisory Group we concluded that the de facto salary relation-ipthat had grown between the top levels in the civil service and the top ranksthe armed forces remained appropriate.   We have had no evidence to suggest thatshould change this view formed in 1974.. Two issues have been drawn to our attention.   The first has been the reducedfferential between the military salary of the Brigadier and the salary of thejor-General.   This problem is less severe than the problem that has arisen ine civil service between the Assistant Secretary and the Under Secretary,vertheless it is important that the salary of the Major General should reflectlly the greater responsibility carried on promotion.   Our recommendations aresigned to do this.. The second issue concerns the relationship between the remuneration of medicalddental officers in the ranks with which we are concerned and that of medicald dental officers in the structure below.   As in 1978, written evidence frome British Medical Association to the Review Body on Armed Forces Pay has beenought to our attention in so far as it is relevant to the salaries of medicaljor Generals and Lieutenant Generals.   As before, the evidence draws attentionthe compression of differentials.   The solution proposed by the British Medicalsociation is that all medical ranks should be brought within the terms ofference of the Review Body on Armed Forces Pay.   We do not see the division ofBponsibility for the pay of the medical ranks between two Review Bodiesbeing in any way a bar to establishing appropriate differentials.   We dowever see disadvantages in dividing responsibility for medical Majorherals and all other Major Generals.   We explained in our 1974 report thatdistinction could be drawn between the nature of the overall responsibilities-1-Review Body on Top Salaries, Report No 6: Report on Top Salaries - Cmnd 5846(paragraph 64).32CONFIDENTIAL

CHAPTER 7CONFIDENTIALSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.  We have not on this occasion carried out a fundamental review of the whole[of our remit as we did in our 1972-74 and 1977-78 reviews.   Instead, we have[identified areas of immediate difficulty and where possible have dealt withI then in our recommendations.   In addition we have brought our previousrecommendations up to date.|91.  The principles on which we have based our recommendations are largely[unchanged.   We have given particular attention in this review to the need tomaintain a reasonable relationship with salaries at lower levels, notablyin the nationalised industries, the civil service and the armed forces. Inthe case of the nationalised industries we have stressed the need for greaterflexibility, within the limits set by our recommendations (paragraph 36). Inparticular we have recommended wider ranges for nationalised industry Boardmembers and Deputy Chairmen (paragraph 43) and have proposed that the Govern-ment should exceptionally be able to make available up to 10 per cent morethan the recommended salary for nationalised industry Board Chairmen in thetop three tiers (paragraph 47).   We have again recommended that there shouldbe greater flexibility in the use of the ranges for Board members (paragraph 59)We have also made suggestions about the content of service contracts given tofull-time Board members (paragraph 57).92.  We recommend the following rateB as appropriate at 1 April 1980. The1average increase is 25.8 per cent   and represents an increase of  10.9 millionin the annual cost of salaries for the appointments within our terms of reference!Within a range of 16.2 per cent to 30.6 per cent, excluding changes which resultfrom an industry being moved from one &apos;tier&apos; to another.   Also excluded are thetwo new additions to the remit.34CONFIDENTIAL

First, we haverecommend a coherent salary structure for the groups for which we are respon-ble, whilst also recognising that, in the civil service and in the nationalisediustries, pay for staff below our terms of reference is settled by negotiation,i secondly we have to recommend levels of remuneration which will enable alle groups within our remit to attract and retain people of the right abilities,rticularly in the judiciary and the nationalised industries.   Given theseastraints and the importance of the appointments to which they relate, welieve that our proposals are right.

All organisations except one replied inme for its information to be used.The use of thousand pound ranges is a crude measure of salary differentials,r example, a difference of 3 one thousand pound ranges between the salaries foro posts could mean a salary differential of between  2,000 and  4,000 dependingthe exact location of each of the salaries in their respective ranges. Otherctors which could affect comparisons between years are job vacancies, andanges in the structure of the organisation, but the comments made by respondentsggest that these factors have had little effect this time.he report on the first survey is given in Report No 10 Second Report onop Salaries (Cmnd 7253, June 1978), Appendix H.or Board Members&apos; salaries at 1 April 1980 the organisations were aBked to givehe salary which would result from the implementation of the recommendations madey the Review Body in its Report No 11.

CONFIDENTIALSURVEY OF TOP SALARIESScope and responseI.   On behalf of the Review Body on Top Salaries, the Office of Manpowerfconomics   carried out a survey of salaries and other direct remunerationpaid to top management (Chairmen, Deputy Chairmen, main Board Members andenior executives reporting directly to the main Board)   in the privateector at 1 January 1980 and 1 January 1979.   This   survey, which is the fifth ofhis nature carried out by the OME for the Review Body, did not seek1.1 (1)nformation on superannuation or fringe benefits .|2.   Questionnaires were sent to 124 organisations.   As for the previous (1979)urvey, whose reference dates were 1 January 1978 and 1 January 1979, theample was drawn from among those organisations which had replied to thehird survey related to end-September 1977 or which had indicated that theyould be willing to be approached on a future occasion.   The sample is aboutthird of the size of that in the third survey,   but the proportion of the firmsn each net assets size group has been kept about the same (as was done forhe 1979 survey).   The overall response rate was 77 per cent compared with9 per cent in the 1979   survey.   As in the past the response rates formailer organisations were generally lower.   Altogether this year&apos;s survey coversearly 1,350 posts in 94 companies.   The response, both as regards organisationsd the posts covered in the analysis of the results, is shown in detail in Tableand compared in Table A below with the response to the previous survey. Inommon with previous surveys, information was requested only for full timeosts whose nature and responsibilities had not changed materially during theeriod covered by the survey, and each organisation was asked to providenformation for a maximum of 30 posts..   Both the current and the previous survey asked for information atJanuary 1979.   The distributions from the two surveys of salary plus bonustc at this date are shown in Table B below.

confidentialShairmen and Deputy Chairmen - in this year&apos;s survey     ,   A further comparison(2)of the two surveys is made in Table C which shows average salaries plusbonus etc for each level of post by size of firm.   Differences betweencorresponding figures in the present survey and the previous one are due mainlyto the selection of different organisations in the two surveys.   They do riotsuggest that for a given level of post either survey was recording a consistentlyhigher average for 1979   salary plus bonus etc than the other.   The percentageincreases at different levels of pay which are shown in Table 3   do not appearto have been significantly affected by the higher proportion of higher levelposts in this year&apos;s survey.Increases in pay from 1 January 1978 to 1 January 1979 (Tables 2 and 3)k.   Table 2 shows the levels of average salaries alone and of average salariesplus bonus, commission and profit sharing in January 1979 and January 1980, andthe percentage increases between those dates.   The percentage increases forsalaries plus bonus etc were as followsChairmen 15.2 per cent (16.0 per cent for salary alone)Deputy Chairman 16.5 per cent (15.9 per cent)Other main Board members 16.9 per cent (17.3 per cent)Senior executives 20.1 per cent (19.7 per cent)All posts 18.3 per cent (18.2 per cent)learly, for a given level of post, there is little difference in the sizef increase if   salary is considered on its own.The average increases in salary plus bonuses etc for senior executives,xcept in the largest companies (net assets of  1,250 million or more) andinance organisations where they are between 23 and 29 per cent, are between7 per cent and 20 per cent.   For other main Board members, except in .inance organisations (where again&apos; the average increase is higher at 24 perIn this year&apos;s survey 58 per cent of the posts covered had a 1979 salary plusbonus etc of  17,500 and over and 38 per cent of the posts were at Board levelor above.   In last year&apos;s survey the corresponding figure for 1979 salary plusbonus etc was 48 per cent and 35 per cent of posts were at Board level or above.Means have been omitted where there are less than 5 posts.52confidential
confidentialJnt) the increases are between 14 per cent and 18 per cent.   In neitherse is there an obvious relationship between the size of organisation ande size of increase   in average salary plus bonus etc.   The sample sizesr Chairmen and Deputy   Chairmen are really too small to give reliabledications of trends or relationships, except perhaps in total, where thecreases are 15 and 17 per cent respectively.Table 3 shows the increase between January 1979 and January 1980 ofary and salary plus bonus, commission and profit sharing, within the rangessalary plus bonus etc in January 1979*   For 1979 salary plus bonus etc. below0,000 the percentage increases show no evidence of change in differentials,pve this level the number of posts is too small to provide reliable guidance.te of last increase in salary   (Table 4)Salaries for 17 per cent of the posts in the survey had been increased onJanuary 1980.   In 4 per cent of posts there had been no increase sinceJanuary 1979 or earlier.   As with last year&apos;s survey January, April, July,(gust and October were the most popular months for increases accounting forper cent of the increases given in the year up to, and including, 1 JanuaryLivels and distribution of salaries in January 1979   (Tables 5 and 6A-D)Table 5 shows for each size of organisation the mean, median, upper andwer quartile and highest and lowest decile salaries plus bonus etc forairmen, Deputy Chairmen, other Board members and senior executives. Generally,r each measure within each group, the level of salary plus bonus, commissionprofit sharing is higher as the size of industrial and commercial firmsreases from the group of firms with  10m to  50m net assets.   The levels ofary plus bonus etc for the finance organisations in the survey match broadlye corresponding levels for the larger non-finance organisations with net assets 250m or more, although the correspondence is by no means exact.Tables 6A to 6D relate to Chairmen, Deputy Chairmen, Board members andior executives respectively and show the detailed distribution of salariess bonus, commission and profit sharing payments by size of organisation.
