CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 46COPY NO22 July 1980CABINETHOUSE OF COMMONS PROCEDUREMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster1. When the Cabinet considered my memorandum (C(80) 41) theydecided that a debate on the outstanding recommendations of the ProcedureCommittee&apos;s report should not be held before the summer Recess. Thiswas on the basis that the Opposition spokesman on procedural matters(The Rt Hon Merlyn Rees, MP) had asked that the debate be deferred untilOctober so that the Opposition could have more time to consider therecommendations.    There was heavy pressure at business questions on17 July (Hansaid, cols. 1757 following), not least from  ur side of the House(including an intervention from the chairman of the 1922 Committee), that theGovernment should implement their pledge to find time for a debate beforethe Recess.    The Leader of the Opposition (The Rt Hon James Callaghan, MPclaimed that the Opposition had objected only to my proposal to hold thedebate on a Friday.    We have now had a further letter from the officialOpposition in which they ask for a general debate on the ProcedureCommittee&apos;s recommendations before the Recess and an opportunity to takedecisions on them, which we have promised; on the timing they suggest thatthe vote should take placet in the Parliamentary spill-over in October.2. I am clear that we must have a debate before the Recess; indeed, inthe light of the events of Tuesday night it is virtually unavoidable and the onething we must prevent is a further Parliamentary row on this matter. Thereare tjvo alternatives:i. A debate with votes before the Recess.ii. A debate before the Recess with votes in the spill-over.From the Government point of view the advantage lies with option i,    but theOpposition Front Bench will prefer ii.    If ii. is favoured the debate could beon the adjournment or on a take-note motion.    If on the adjournment, thedebate would have the disadvantage of covering all outstanding proceduralmatters, including, for example, the establishment of new sub-committeesfor the departmental select committees.   If on a take-note motion, thiswould enable us to put greater boundaries on the scope of the debate, but themotion itself would be liable to amendment.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3.        If option i. is preferred a general debate (excluding selectcommittees) would be followed by votes on resolutions and amendments.On balance I prefer the first option, partly because it would dispose of diematter in one debate rather than two, but primarily because I think itincreases the chances of our persuading the House to reject thoserecommendations of the Procedure Committee which would seriously hamperthe Government&apos;s control of business and its ability to secure the passage oflegislation.4*       I therefore invite my colleagues:a. to agree that I should announce that there will be a debate,before the Recess, on House of Commons procedure;b. to decide on the form of the debate;c. to give further consideration to my memorandum C(80) 41 sothat I may have the general guidance of the Cabinet for the line tobe taken in the debate, whatever form it takes*N St J SPrivy Council Office22 July 19802CONFIDENTIAL
