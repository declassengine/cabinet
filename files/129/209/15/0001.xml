CONFIDENTIALMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(80) 404 July 1980CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE, 1981-82 to 1983-84Memoiandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. In this paper I set out proposals designed to maintain the netexpenditure totals for 1981-82 to 1983-84 published in Cmnd 7841, but to allowsome reordering to deal with the industrial and social problems created by therecession.    Thie is in line with our discussion on 3 July (CC(80) 27thConclusions, Minute 5).2. The particularly difficult year is 1981-82, with the prospect of a highpublic sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) and severe financial difficultiesfor Industry.    We must therefore look especially critically at our expenditureplans for that year.TIMETABLE3. We should settle in July our policy on local authorities&apos; currentexpenditure in 1981-82, with a view to a statement before the Recess.    This isthe last opportunity to exercise an effective influence, and totals for individualservices in 1981-82 need to be settled before mid-September so that theimplications for block grant distribution can be worked out in time for theNovember Rate Support Grant settlement.    We also need early decisions onthe nationalised industries&apos; figures for 1981-82 as a basis for setting theirexternal financing limits, and decisions by end-September on local authoritycapital for 1981-82.4. Final decisions on the other programmes do not have to be reacheduntil October.    If the outlook then shows serious financial problems we mayhave to look again at the expenditure totals, which for the time being we aim tomaintain.   By then the decisions on local authorities and nationalised industrieswill have foreclosed major areas; if further adjustment is needed the burdenwill fall on the other, mainly central Government, programmes.    We shouldkeep this in mind in considering the decisions on local authorities andnationalised industries.COPY NO821CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. Decisions on the years after 1981-82 are not so urgent, but it will beconvenient to take them also in the autumn.THE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE TOTAL.6. &apos;       As the Prime Minister said in the House, it is vital that the reductionsin our contribution to the European Community (EC) should be used to reducepublic expenditure, the PSBR and interest rates.    Therefore we must plannow on keeping within the totals already agreed and published in March, asreduced by the EC savings.7. The expenditure figures we are now considering in &quot;1960 Survey prices&quot;will be substantially increased by the time we get to 1981-82 by pay and pricemovements which have already taken place, and others yet to come.    Pay andprice increases generally are important to the PSBR because of their impacton the ecoromy at large, but we must be particularly concerned with therelative development, above all of pay, between the public and private sectors.My proposals assume that the relative increase in public sector pay due to thecatching-up awards of the past year will be halted.    On this basis we can for .the present talk sensibly around the figures in 1980 Survey prices used in thispaper, and leave discussion of pay and cash limits until later, perhaps untilNovember.    But each percentage point by which the movement of publicservice pay in the next pay round is higher or lower than I have assumed willaffect expenditure in 1981 -82 by  275-300 million - equivalent to about 200 million in 1980 Survey prices.8. The effect of the recession on the nationalised industries is at thecentre of our problems in this Survey.    The four major loss-makers (coal,rail,   steel and shipbuilding) are in difficulties in keeping on the courseembodied in Cmnd 7841, but also because of substantial additional bids fortelecommunications investment and financing.    The industries&apos; Investmentand Financing Review, which we shall discuss in the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy on 9 July, will give an opportunity to discuss measures tokeep down their financing needs.    Until we have considered policy papers onthe loss-makers, I have assumed provisionally that the shortfall previouslyallowed for will not occur.    That adds nearly  ^ billion to the publicexpenditure totals, within which to accommodate increases on some industriesand reductions on others.9. On top of this, in a few mainly demand-led programmes someincreases in expenditure will have to be accepted without full offset. So,while my general approach is to ask colleagues to absorb pressures for extraexpenditure within the totals already agreed, some net reductions must bemade.10. The further cuts we have agreed in Civil Service numbers shouldprovide additional savings, provided they are not offset by contracting servicesout to the private sector.    But the net savings will not be available in full until2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe end of the period and in some programmes will offset increases in otherexpenditure.    With the important exception of defence, I have carried forwardthe Z\ per cent cut being made this year (this amounts, over all programmesexcluding defence, to some  55 million a year), but I have taken no account ofthe further savings in my proposals at Annex A.    I shall want to look at thisagain in the light of the Lord President of the Council&apos;s report (which we are todiscuss before the end of the month) on where the savings are to be made.11. We shall need to consider the size of the contingency reserve later.Without prejudice to whatever decisions we eventually take on the upratings ofchild benefit, we should now make provision in the social security programmefor those upratings, and in the employment programme for the specialemployment measures.    The money thus freed in the contingency reserve islikely to be needed to cope with pressures arising from the recession and toprovide for some flexibility in end-year expenditure.IMPLICATIONS FOR PROGRAMMES12. Accordingly I propose that we plan for the time being on the basis ofthe net changes from the plans in Cmnd 7841 listed in Annex A.   References tospecific measures are elaborated in the Survey report (C(80) 38).LOCAL AUTHORITIES13. It is crucial for our policy that local authorities reduce their expen-diture as planned.    We are taking steps to bring them into line in 1980-81.The further reductions planned for 1981-82 onwards must also be obtained. Ifa Minister feels it unavoidable to increase the provision for local authorityspending on the services for which he is responsible I propose that he shouldfind offsetting savings on his other programmes.DEFENCE14. The growth of the defence programme cannot be unrelated to prospectsfor the economy as a whole, or to what we can manage in other fields. Theproposal in Annex A is to base the 3 per cent growth on the likely outturn in1979-80.    This permits a saving of about  140 million a year in the planspublished in March.    This would offset the increase in the relative cost of thisprogramme since those plans were determined.    When we look at the plansagain for final decision in the autumn, we may have to consider furtherwhether we can afford to maintain this rate of growth for defence, which ismatched by few of our allies.BNDUSTRY15. Substantial estimating increases on demand-led programmes havearisen here.    It may not be possible to offset them all by reductions within theprogramme.    A net increase of some  40 million in 1981-82 is probably3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALinevitable, apart from any bids on the contingency reserve we may need toconsider as a result of industrial problems, for example on Rolls-Royce orBritish Leyland.TRADE16. The foreign borrowing which the Civial Aviation Authority need tofinance theix air traffic control investment, and which would previously nothave scored against the public expenditure planning totals, should now beaccepted as an addition.EMPLOYMENT17. It would be right in present circumstances, and in line with ourdiscussion last week, to provide for some net increase in the employmentprogramme.    I have therefore provided for the continuation of the specialemployment measures beyond next April, and for further expenditure on theyouth unemployment programme.    I hope the Secretary of State forEmployment will be able to help by making some offsetting savings but wecannot expect, with rising unemployment, to offset the whole amount within hisprogramme.    A net increase of some  30 million in 1981-82, rising to 70 million in 1983-84, probably needs to be accepted.EDUCATION18. We need to look to this programme to contribute some net savings, inaddition to those required to offset the loss of the school transport measure.It should be possible to make savings of  50 million in 1981-82 and 75 million in later years, mainly on capital expenditure, higher educationand a small adjustment in the school-leaving age (allowing pupils nearing their16th birthday the option of leaving in the summer).    This would partially offsetthe increase in the relative cost of this programme (reflecting the teachers&apos;pay increase) since we last determined our plans.HOUSING19. We also need further savings from this programme, even though ourplans already envisage a substantial reduction from recent levels.    I proposereductions of some  65-80 million a year (2-3 per cent) by seeking largerrent increases and cutting the provision for housebuilding and improvement.HEALTH SERVICE20. Some income on which we had counted to reduce the net healthprogramme has been lost or is in danger.    We must ask the Secretary ofState for Social Services to take such steps as are necessary to makealternative savings, even if, regrettably, this means some temporaryreduction in standards until expansion can be resumed.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSOCIAL SECURITY21. We should now make explicit provision in this programme for upratingchild benefit annually from November 1981 in line with prices, withoutprejudice to our eventual decisions.    The &lt;~ost is some  75 million in 1981-82rising to  360 million in 1983-84.    We cannot afford to go further than that,and we should resist pressures to do so.22. But we must seek some contribution to our problems from this verylarge programme, despite the considerable political difficulties.    The savingsproposed for this programme in Annex A could be achieved in part by onceagain holding back the next (November 1981) uprating on benefits covered by theSocial Security (No 2) Bill by another 5 per cent, and holding back all otherbenefits except retirement pensions and child benefit by l\ per cent. Thesewould, inevitably, be controversial.    Nevertheless justification for holdingback the uprating will be reinforced if, as we expect, earnings in the next yearor so rise more slowly than prices in this country, as already has beenhappening elsewhere.SCOTLAND, WALES AND NORTHERN IRELAND23. The usual formula would indicate proportional changes for Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland.    But there is evidence that the share ofexpenditure per head of population, taking into account assessed need, has beenhigher in Scotland and Northern Ireland than in Wales and England.    I haveagreed with the Ministers concerned that we should take account of this whendeciding the allocation of additions or reductions.    I do not propose an extrareduction in the programme for Northern Ireland this year, but I suggest anextra reduction of  150 million a year in planned Scottish programmes.Applying the results of the Needs Assessment Study to 1980-81 indicates that areadjustment of planned expenditure to enable each country to provide thesame level of services would entail a reduction in Scotland of some 300 million.    The limitations of the Study make it unwise to treat theconclusions as precise, but a reduction of half the amount indicated seemsjustifiable.    This would also largely offset the increase in the relative cost ofthe Scottish programmes since we last determined our plans.CONCLUSION24. The result of these proposals would be that we would just about main-tain the totals we published in Cmnd 7841, as reduced by the EC savings.25. Accordingly I propose that we:i.       Confirm that we now plan on keeping to the net totals for 1981-82to 1983-84 published in Cmnd 7841, as reduced by the EC settlement.ill&apos; 5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALii. Agree that, subject to i. , I should discuss with any Minister whoso wishes the net reductions and additions shown in Annex A.iii. Decide before the Summer Recess the totals for current localauthority services in 1981-82 so that a statement can be made to thelocal authorities.iv. Agree that I should come back to Cabinet in the autumn with finalproposals on the remaining programmes.WJBTreasury Chambers4 July 19806CONFIDENTIAL
