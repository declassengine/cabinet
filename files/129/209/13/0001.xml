CONFIDENTIALIntroductionPUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1981-82 TO 1983-841980 REPORT BY THE PUBLIC EXPENDITURESURVEY COMMITTEEIntroductionThis interdepartmental report by officials brings together thedetailed factual and analytical material which provides the basis forthe 1980 public expenditure survey. It is mainly intended forreference. A further report to Ministers deals with the financingrequirements of the nationalised industries.2. This report takes account of the outcome of the recent CAPprice fixing settlements, but not of the agreed arrangementsfor reducing the UK net contribution to the EEC budget.3. The report has been drawn up on a departmental basis, asagreed by Ministers. Each departmental chapter describes the surveybaseline (the plans in the March 1980 White Paper revalued to 1980survey prices broadly autumn 1979 prices and adjusted forsubsequent Ministerial decisions) and its implications. It thenpresents the following material in terms of changes from thebaseline:(a) The effect, where applicable, of the revised economicassumptions listed in Supplementary Analysis M;(b) The effect of the 1980-81 cash limits squeeze, distinguishingthe 2&apos;/2% reduction in civil service manpower and relatedexpenditure (where the squeeze has generally been carriedthrough into the later years) from the remaining squeeze(where it has not);(c) Other reduced requirements not included in the baseline;(d) Proposals for additional expenditure (including estimatingincreases other than those resulting from revised economicassumptions as at (a)) and any offsetting savings;(e) Options for reductions amounting to 2% of baselineexpenditure in 1981 -82 and 3% in later years, as requested byMinisters.4. A number of Supplementary Analyses are also included.Analyses A to G aggregate the information described in the previousparagraph to show the position for public expenditure as a whole.CONFIDENTIAL3
IntroductionCONFIDENTIALAnalyses H to L provide detailed background information onexpenditure in cost terms, public service manpower, local authorityexpenditure, and construction expenditure.

The defence budget is central governmentexpenditure, nearly ail of it on goods and services.The Royal Ordnance Factory figures representrepayments to the National Loans Fund.Implications of the baseline figures2. UK defence spending must be seen in thecontext of membership of the NATO Alliance. Abasic yardstick against which the UK&apos;s contributionto NATO is measured is the agreement reached byHeads of Government to aim for real annualincreases in the region of 3% in defence spending.This agreement covers the current NATO planningperiod to 1986. The plans announced in Cmnd.7841 conform to this NATO target and have beenwelcomed by our partners in the Alliance. TheUK&apos;s achievement so far although less than the 3%target has been amongst the best in the Alliance andthe proportion of GDP devoted to defence isthe highest amongst major European members.Measured in terms of defence spending per capitahowever the UK comes much lower in the leaguetable. In maintaining adequate defence capabilitiesin the face of the increasing threat posed by theSoviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies (as set outin the 1980 Defence White Paper Cmnd. 7826) theabsolute amounts spent matter most.3. Following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistanand events elsewhere in South West Asia there isincreasing and high level pressure within NATOand notably from the US for measures already in theforward programme to be accelerated and for newsteps to be taken to improve NATO&apos;s defences. It isclear that within the constraints of the figure estab-lished in Cmnd. 7841 it will only be possible for theU K to make a limited response to these initiatives.4. The year-by-year figures for growth implied bythe survey baseline are as follows:1979- 80 - 2-4%1980- 81 - 4%*1981- 82 - 3*4%1982- 83 - 3%1983- 84 - 3%* (see paragraph 6)CONFIDENTIAL5
1.   Ministry of DefenceCONFIDENTIALThe forecast of outturn in volume terms for1979- 80 has been reduced since Cmnd. 7841mainly because of measures taken to try and staywithin cash limits and this explains the reductionfrom 29% to 2&quot;4% growth. This lowered baselineaccounts for the implied increase in 1980-81 from3 5% in Cmd. 7841 to 4%, but since the new figuredoes not allow for any cash limit squeeze on thevolume programme the increase in actual spendingmay be lower see paragraph 6 below. The increaseabove 3% in 1981-82 is accounted for bytechnical factors in the revaluation process: theCmnd. 7841 counter-part of the 1981-82 figureshowed only 3% growth over 1980-81 at 1979Survey prices. Taken overall, the Survey baselinefigures are fully consistent with the UK&apos;s commit-ment to the NATO growth aim. Indeed, straight 3%annual increases over the outturn for 1979-80would produce savings against the Survey baselineof  417 million over the Survey period.5. The Ministry of Defence is currently consider-ing the outcome of the annual Long Term Costingof the defence programme. There is a sizeable gapbetween the cost of the programme and the Surveybaseline. To close the gap it will be necessary to re-shape the programme, taking account of Ministers&apos;wishes to have an enhanced ability to operate out-side the NATO area and their consideration ofoptions for the replacement of the strategic nucleardeterrent. Adjusting the programme will involvedifficult choices which will need to be consideredby Ministers collectively.Reduced requirements not included in baseline:Cash limit squeeze in 1980-816. The cash limit factors by comparison with theBudget forecast for inflation imply a volume reduc-tion of  175 million in the defence programme for1980- 81. This is after allowance has been made forthe agreement to adjust the cash limit in respect ofthe cost of the Government&apos;s decisions on theReport of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body the Prime Minister&apos;s statement in the House ofCommons on 29 April refers (Hansard Cols.414-415). Account may have to be taken of theextent to which the cash limit was overspent in1979-80, provisionally estimated at  60 million. Inaddition the Cabinet has agreed that the defencecash limit will be kept under review during theyear.Additional bids   offsetting savings7. No additional bids are being made at this stage.The position will fall to be confirmed afterMinisters have decided on re-shaping theprogramme see paragraph 5.8. Additional bids for COI expenditure to main-tain recruitment publicity campaigns at presentlevels are shown in accordance with the arrange-ment whereby such bids are where appropriate,entered in the chapters of the relevant majordepartments. The Treasury considers that the sumsin question should be found within the totals for thedefence programme.9. The Ministry of Defence is pursuing a vigorouscampaign for administrative and other economies.Any savings will be subsumed in the process ofadjusting the defence programme.Options for reductions10. It is not possible for the MOD to set out at thisstage with precision what would be involved inreductions of 2% and 3% (some  200 million and 300 million pa) as required by the Surveyguidelines. Such options could be specific onlywhen Ministers have reached decisions on theshape of the defence programme as explainedabove. In any case, such reductions would meanHMG reneging on its commitment to the NATOaim of annual real growth in the region of 3%. TheGovernment&apos;s credibility in the Alliance would beundermined. The Treasury point out that thedefence programme has no special reserved statusand that it will, like all other programmes, stand tobe considered in the light of current economiccircumstances in the forthcoming Ministerialdiscussions on public expenditure. The factorsdescribed in paragraph 2-4 will be among those thatjwill have to be taken into account.6CONFIDENTS

Overseas aid is the main programme for whichthe Overseas Development Administration (ODA)is responsible. This provides for financial aid andtechnical co-operation to developing countries andcontributions to certain multilateral institutions,including the UK&apos;s share of concessional assistancejodeveloping countries provided through the Euro-pean Community Budget.2. The other programmes are overseas aidadministration and the pensions and superannua-tion element of &quot;Other External Relations&quot;, whichcovers the pension liabilities arising from service informer colonial territories.!  Statutory authority for overseas aid is mainlyprovided by the Overseas Aid Act 1966. Expendi-ture on pensions and superannuation is coveredpiefly by the Pensions (Increase) Act 1971.Implications of the baseline figures4. The public expenditure figures show the net aidprogramme. In addition, ODA can add to thisamortisation receipts on past loans which arerecycled as new aid grants or loans but do notcount, under present definitions, as public expendi-ture. The net aid programme plus amortisationgives the gross aid programme (which is ODA&apos;s&quot;spending target&quot;) as follows:   million	1980-81	1981-82	1982-83	1983-84Net aid programme	803-1	755-0	698-3	6980Amortisation	692	54*1	55-9	54-5Gross aid programme	872-3	809-1	754-2	752-5Net overseas aid by 1982-83 will be 14 per centbelow the allocation made for 1979-80 in Cmnd.onfidential7
2.   FCO Overseas Development AdministrationCONFIDENTIAL7841 and 104 per cent lower than the estimatedoutturn in that year. The existing survey figuresthus represent a considerably deeper cut than theaverage for public expenditure as a whole.5. These reductions make it difficult to meet exist-ing commitments while preserving flexibility in theaid programme and attempting to implement effec-tively the conclusions of the aid policy review.ODA estimate that bilateral country programmeswill have to decline by 45 per cent by 1983-84because of the reduction in the overall level of aidcoupled with rising and inescapable multilateralcommitments, especially to the European Com-munity and World Bank.6. The Government has accepted their predeces-sors&apos; commitment in principle (first accepted in1974) to move towards the UN 07 per cent of GNPofficial development assistance target. But it wasmade clear that progress must continue to be condi-tioned by our financial and economic circum-stances and there is no timetable for achieving thistarget. Nevertheless, the planned reductions inoverseas aid will lead to a decline in our perfor-mance against the aid target, (in 1978 thisamounted to 048 per cent of GNP; the preliminaryestimate for 1979 is 0&apos;52 per cent). This coincideswith considerable public and Parliamentary inter-est in the proposals of the Brandt CommissionReport (which recommends, inter alia, increases inofficial aid by target dates) as well as the launchingby the UN General Assembly later this year of anew international development strategy for the1980s. International pressure, both from develop-ing countries and our Western partners, to reversethis downward trend, therefore, may well increase.Additional bids7. Full cost fees for overseas students mean anadditional charge of some  3 million which isbeing absorbed within the  1980-81 technicalco-operation training programme in Britain fonofficially   sponsored   people   from developingcountries. As these fees take fuller effect thecumulative additional costs are estimated at  5million in 1981-82 and  6 million in both 1982-83and 1983-84. The ODA consider that additionaprovision should be made to offset the effect ojthese costs on the numbers coming to the UK fotraining from developing countries under the overjseas aid programme. In the Treasury&apos;s view thmoney  should   be  found   from  within thaprogramme.Options for Reductions8. The further cuts in overseas aid shown in thtable (2% in 1981-82 and 3% in the later yeanwould exacerbate the difficulties referred to i|paragraphs 4-6 above. The distribution of cuwould necessarily be determined by the pattern ccommitments and would thus bear almost entire!on bilateral programmes (which are expected to bless than half the aid programme by 1983-84).would be even more difficult, therefore,implement the central conclusion of the aid polioreview, that greater weight should be given  political, commercial and industrial considerationalongside developmental objectives.9. Savings cannot be found against the pensiofland superannuation programme, which arises frcfllegislative commitments. Reductions in Depalmental expenditure of the order required, therefoBwould be at the expense of further cuts in the leflof overseas aid.8CONFIDENT

Programme 2.7 comprises United Kingdomigross contributions to the European CommunityBudget (excluding amounts attributed to aid),capital contributions to the European InvestmentBank and public sector receipts by the UnitedKingdom from the Community Budget and theEuropean Coal and Steel Community.2. The Community Budget is denominated inEuropean units of account (EUA); conversions intosterling have been made at forecast rates ofexchange.3. The baseline figures show the estimated cost ofexisting Community policies and allow for theincidence of anticipated new policies in future yearswhere the effect of these can be quantified. Inparticular, the figures include an estimate of the nettost of Greek membership of the Community from1981 onwards. The baseline figures took no accountof any reductions in the UK net contribution as aNt of the continuing negotiations with other&quot;Member States; neither did they take account of theeffects of the 1% limit on Community VATrevenue. Expenditure on the Guarantee Section ofthe Common Agricultural Policy, which representsover 70% of Community Budget expenditure, wasassumed to grow at the same rate as in previousyears.4. The revised estimates have been based onsimilar assumptions to the baseline figures andshow reductions for each forecast year except1983-84. These reductions result mainly fromhigher forecasts of receipts from the GuaranteeSection and Regional Fund. Receipts fromGuidance individual projects have been included inthe figures for the first time and an offsettingincrease in expenditure has been included inprogramme 3.1. There has been an increase inreceipts from the ECSC in anticipation of BritishSteel Corporation closures.5. The revised figures do not also includeestimates of the effect of the arrangements forreducing the UK net contribution which have nowbeen agreed.ONFIDENTTAL11
4.  European Community BudgetCONFIDENTIAL6. The arrangements are that, for 1980 there willbe a ceiling on the UK net contribution of  370million, provided it does not exceed  1,080 millionbefore adjustment. For 1981, there will be a ceilingof  440 million, provided the net contribution,before adjustment, does not exceed   1,300 million.A further element is a risk sharing formula whichwill operate if the unadjusted UK net contributionfor these two years exceeds the estimates above. For1980, the UK will bear only one quarter of anyexcess. For 1981, the UK would meet the first  12million of any excess in full, it would meet half thenext  60 million excess and one quarter of anyfurther excess. (All the sterling figures quotedabove are converted from EUA at the rate of 1=1 65 EUA, which differs slightly from theexchange rate assumptions used in the estimates).7. For 1982, it is envisaged that by that time theCouncil will have completed a review of the patternof Community expenditure and the operation of theBudget. However, if that does not producearrangements solving the UK budget problem theCommission will put forward proposals alongthe lines of the 1980 and 1981 arrangements andthe Council will act accordingly. The arrangementcontains no specific provision beyond 1982.8. The amounts resulting from these arrange-ments will be paid to the UK by means ofadjustments, to the Financial Mechanism and aRegulation providing for supplementary expendi-ture in the UK The credits will be inscribed in theBudget of the following financial year but thearrangements provide for advance payments. It isexpected that payments for 1980 will be receivedbefore the end of 1980-81. The detailed applicationof these arrangements has yet to be settled.9. The effect of the changes to the baselinedescribed in paragraph 4 are shown in the tablebelow.  million10. Unlike most other programmes, expenditureon this programme cannot be directly controlled,It depends partly on unpredictable variables likthe effect of the weather on agricultural productioin the Community, and partly on decisions by thEEC Council of Ministers and the EuropeaParliament in many policy areas.11. The Community Budget is financed fromagricultural levies and customs duties collected bjMember States and the product of a rate, noiexceeding 1%, applied to a notional harmonisecCommunity VAT base. What will happen wherthis ceiling on the Community&apos;s revenue is reacheis uncertain and no decisions have yet bee^taken by the Community. For the above estimate?no allowance has been made for the effect c|the ceiling, which could be exceeded in 1981 o1982, nor of the review of the pattern qCommunity expenditure and the operation of thBudget.12. The United Kingdom&apos;s gross share of thBudget is estimated to decrease from about 20% i1980 to about 17-5% in 1984. In 1980 the Unite!Kingdom ceased to benefit from the transitionarrangements which have applied to gross budgtary contributions since Accession.13. The table below shows the latest estimatescontributions to, and receipts from, the CommunitBudget, broken down by the main areasexpenditure and receipts.Options for reductions14. The reduction to the UK&apos;s net contributionthe Community Budget which has been negotiatwill yield savings well in excess of the 2% and 3reductions.1980-81 1981-82 1982-83 1983-84Baseline (Cmnd. 7841) 1,024-4 1,138-8 1,321-6 1,532-2Changes arising fromrevised forecasts  63-8 -54-7 -312 +170Total change from baseline  638  54-7  312 +170CONFIDENTI

Expenditure by IBAP is incurred in marketregulation under the Common Agricultural Policy(CAP). The main components are interventionbuying and selling, various production, storage andanimal feed subsidies and payments on imports andexports. Almost all of it is mandatory under ECRegulations and most is 100 per cent funded fromthe EC Budget. Programme 3 covers IBAP&apos;s grossexpenditure, the associated receipts from the ECbeing credited to Programme 2 where they serve toreduce the United Kingdom&apos;s net contribution tothe EC. Expenditure is particularly unpredictableas it depends, inter alia, on trade volumes, worldcommodity prices, exchange rates and day to dayoperations of the CAP instruments of marketmanagement.2. The Board&apos;s Central and miscellaneous servicesexpenditure is mainly in respect of the Board&apos;s staffcosts and those of agencies undertaking work on its]behalf.Implications of the baseline figures3. The baseline provides for expenditure on thBoard&apos;s various operations based on a view omarket trends and world prices taken in Septembe&apos;1979. This provision is not sufficient to cover th.Board&apos;s latest forecasts and additional bids fof1981-82 and later years are included below. Thbaseline for 1981-82 onwards provides for thcontinuation of the UK butter subsidy, althougthis is subject to annual re-negotiation.Reduced requirements not included in baseline4. This is the 2\ per cent squeeze on the Boardwages and salary costs and the Board&apos;s Agenwages and salary costs.14CONFIDENTIA

The estimating change for 1981-82includes an increase off 17-5 million in expenditure[on intervention, compared with a reduction of  5million in intervention expenditure in later years.This largely accounts for the difference in the sizeof the bids between the years.6. Also included is an estimate of the effects of thetAP price fixing on this programme. The estimatetakes account of the average 5 per cent increase inprices; an EC sheepmeat regime estimated to costW5 million in 1981-82 and  65 million in futurepears; a suckler cow subsidy estimated to cost   17million a year; and refunds on exports of whiskywsting  20 million annually. These increases areoffset to some extent by an increase in the level of&apos;lieco-responsibility levy on milk producers, whichpres as an offset to expenditure.7. The EC price fixing package also included anoption for the continuation of the variable beefpremium scheme. Whether this option should beexercised is the subject of a separate Ministerialdiscussion, and the estimated annual cost of some 7$ to  8$ million   to cover premium paymentand administration has not yet been included at thisstage.8. An additional bid in each year of  4-3 million isincluded under central and miscellaneous services.This comprises  0-3 million to maintain staffinglevels adequate to meet existing commitments, anda tentative figure of  4 million to cover the staffingimplications of the CAP price-fixing. The latterelements would largely take the form of agencypayments. No allowance has been included for anypossible change in the administration of the schoolmilk subsidy scheme.Options for reductions9. Most of the Board&apos;s expenditure is determinedby EC Regulations and is not subject to direct UKcontrol. The only exception is the consumer buttersubsidy which is covered by EC Regulations butwhich prescribes only the maximum level ofsubsidy which may be paid. To secure the 2% and3% options on this programme the subsidy wouldhave to be reduced by some 2p per pound in1981-82 and some 3p per pound in 1982-83 and1983-84. No legislation would be required for thischange. This subsidy is, 100 per cent financed bythe EC.Ndential15

The falling expenditure planned for agri-cultural grants and subsidies reflects the changes incapital grant rates announced on 31 January 1980nd the limits on the amount of investment eligiblei)r grant. The higher level of planned fisheriesxpenditure in the two middle years allows for the&quot;placement of fishery protection vessels and 2(search vessels.

This programme covers a variety of industrialsupport measures: Regional Development Grants(RDGs); regional and national selective assistance;support for R &amp; D; shipbuilding; the NEB;Concorde; and support for BL and Rolls Royce. Inline with their policies decided in OppositionMinisters agreed last year to significant cuts in theDepartment&apos;s programme over the period to1983-84. These cuts were achieved principally bychanges in regional policy, in the provision for theNEB and by reductions in the provision forselective assistance. Support for R &amp; D was alsoreduced. Revised policies covering the majorchanges were announced in July 1979. By 1983-84regional support will account for SO per cent of thereduced programme.Implications of the Baseline2. On a number of programmes the Departmentof Industry judge the baseline to be inadequate.This gives rise to a number of additional bids whichare listed in table 8 and described more fully inparagraph 8 below.3. There are in addition a number of uncertaintiesaffecting some of the baselines for sub-programmeswhich are not the subject of specific bids. There aremajor unquantifiable questions about the futurefunding of BL and Rolls Royce. Future provisionfor the former is limited to  7 5 m cash in 1981 -82,included under the NEB. This is the balance of theRyder  1 billion. On Rolls Royce Ministers haveagreed in principle to the provision of furthfinancing but will not discuss the amounts untRolls Royce produce a new strategic plan in June.4. Similarly, neither the baseline nor the speci,additional bids,  include sums that mayrequired: (i) to cover any future phases of the shipbuildiintervention fund or an extension to the shibuilding redundancy payments scheme whiqis due to end in 1981.

In addition to the effects of the cash limitssqueeze, which affects particularly the four sub-pgrammes comprising Scientific and Technologi-cal Assistance, a lower forecast of investmentintentions by industry gives rise to reductions in theprojected take-up of RDG&apos;s.Additional Bids and Offsetting Savings|S. (i) Regional Development GrantsThis bid results from the assisted area up-gradings in steel rundown areas agreed byMinisters on 12th June (full year cost  16million). fymq(ii) Regional Selective AssistanceThis bid results from revised forecasts ofdemand under existing policies. Theprovision for future industrial support is in-adequate to meet this additional demand in1982-83.(iii) National Enterprise BoardLast July Ministers agreed to provide theNEB with  140 million (cash) for its hightechnology and regional/small firms rolesover the three year period to March 1983.In the event it was not possible to accom-modate that decision within theexpenditure decisions taken by Cabinet lastautumn.(iv) Other Support ServicesThe Department of Industry sponsorseducational activities aimed primarily atinteresting young people in the engineeringand associated professions and at identify-ing and filling, through &quot;pump-priming&quot;support, gaps between the further educationservice and the training requirements ofindustry. The Department considers thatthese activities should be expanded. Theadditional bid sought would approximatelydouble the level of activity.(v) Scientific and Technological AssistanceThis is a cash-limited management budgetcomprising four separate but related sub-programmes concerned with research anddevelopment. The additional bid, whichwould rather more than restore thereductions made in this budget followingCabinet&apos;s review of public expenditure lastyear, covers two of these, viz:(a) Industrial R&amp;D and Other SupportIn the Department&apos;s view more of ournational resources must be channelledurgently to opportunities in new tech-nologies where our industrialcompetitors, with Government aid, areinvesting more heavily than the UK.This programme already provides for alarge proportion of the existing micro-electronics support programmesintroduced by the last Government andother measures of product support. Theadditional resources would be directedtowards stimulating UK activity infields such as fibre optics, telematics,biotechnology and robotics.(b) SpaceIn the Department&apos;s view space supporthas considerable potential benefits forUK firms, not only through their directinvolvement in space projects, but alsothrough ground developments in tele-communication and satellitebroadcasting that UK participation inEuropean Space Agency and otherinternational projects may bring. Thesebenefits might well be unobtainable ifspace support were reduced.(vi) Home Shipbuilding LendingThis expenditure relates to refinancingshipbuilding loans taken out before 1 April1980 and interest support costs. Theadditional bid is due to slippage in ship-building programmes which lead to loansbeing advanced later than expected withhigher payments falling particularly in1981-82. This is partially offset by areduced level of interest support paymentsin that year.(vii) Assistance to ShipbuildingThis bid relates to forecast higher expendi-ture on redundancy payments and onNPIDENTIAL23
8.  Department of IndustryCONFIDENTSexisting commitments under the ship-building cost escalation scheme (nowended).(viii) Assistance to the Steel IndustryThis programme is concerned with pay-ment to redundant steel workers under astatutory scheme. The bid arises from thede-manning measures announced first withthe closures of Shotton and Corby, then inDecember 1979 as part of more widespreadcut-backs in steel production. Payments toredundant steelworkers are made understatute and alterations would require anOrder to be laid before Parliament. Up tohalf the costs of the payments are refundedby the ECSC and are netted-oiT against theUK contribution to the EuropeanCommunities.(ix) Departmental AdministrationThe small bid under this CSD-contro 1 ledprogramme arises mainly from additionalcomputer costs   for a Regional OfficeInformation system, from the increased costof the Business Statistics Office computerand from higher software and maintenancecosts. Part of the bid arises from the in-adequate transfer of PES provision from theCCA when this item of expenditure ceasedto be provided on an allied service basisfrom 1980-81.(x) Ad hoc Contributions to the European Coaland Steel Community.The UK and other member countries haveagreed in the last three years to make ad hoccontributions to the ECSC to correct animbalance in its budget occasioned by theparlous state of the communities Steelindustry. It is likely that further ad hoc con-tributions will be required in the later yearsof the survey. The Department considerthat expenditure resulting from this bidshould be scored on programme 2, onwhich ECSC receipts are recorded.9. The offsetting savings shown in table 8 arisefrom increased receipts from R&amp;D levies onRB211 engines. These savings, however, will bemore than offset by the as yet undecided futurefinancing requirements of Rolls Royce. At this stagethe Department is not in a position to offer sub-stantive savings to offset the additional bidsdescribed above. The Secretary of State hashowever asked officials to find further economieand these will be reported as soon as possible. Thprecise treatment of such savings would be fofurther consideration.Options for Reductions10. Following the decisions taken last year thiprogramme will decline (even if all of the additionabids were approved) by over 50 per cent betwee1980-81 and 1982-83. In the Department&apos;s viethis makes it particularly difficult to identify optiocuts that are consistent with assurances that havbeen given about the maintenance of industrial sunport after the new policies announced in July 197911. The Department of Industry have identifietwo possible areas: (i) Regional Development GrantsIn theory, expenditure on RDGs couldreduced in several ways, eg, cutting the ratof grant, increasing the thresholds of qualifiing investment which would disqualify smainvestment by smaller firms, exclusionparticular sectors, and further moratoria &lt;jpayments. In practice, changes in the RDcriteria necessary to achieve the cuts soug,would be extremely difficult to reconcile wiassurances that have been given concerni;the stability of regional policy following tchanges announced in July 1979. An Ordwould be required to change criteria.(ii) Refinancing Home Shipbuilding LendingLast year the Government decided to strefinancing new shipbuilding loans taken oafter 1 April 1980 without prejudice tocommitment to continue refinancing existiloans. This option relates to the disposalearly repayment of existing refinancing loafSuch loans could be passed back to the banin order to achieve short term public expditure savings at the cost of reducing repments (thus increasing expenditure) in lajyears. Such an arrangement would marally increase the cost of interest support (iethe difference between the &quot;agreed&quot; rateinterest paid to the banks and the Govement&apos;s own borrowing rate   say, slighjover 1 per cent). The Bank of England hadvised that it would be premature to re-o;discussions with the Clearing Banksrefinancing so soon after last yenegotiations. This factor may not be decis24CONFIDENT
Confidential8.  Department of Industryas it would not be necessary to dispose of theloans before 1982. A further important con-sideration would be the need for additionalsavings in the mid 1980s to &quot;make good&quot; theloss of repayments which would haveoccurred then.12, Pending the outcome of the Department&apos;stoiew of the scope for further savings the Treasuryrate that a wider range of smaller adjustmentsmerit consideration to achieve savingsequivalent to the options for reduction listed in8. Such adjustments might include: a change to the threshold for RDG&apos;s;savings on Scientific and Technologicalassistance. In particular, the baseline pro-vides for expenditure on the MicroprocessorApplications Project (MAP) beyond the  25million review point agreed by Ministers lastyear. It would also be possible to reduce therate of grant for product support by adminis-trative action.(iii) Savings to be achieved by closer scrutiny ofschemes for regional selective assistance.(iv) Savings on national selective assistance. Thissub-programme largely covers commitmentsarising from the sectoral schemes undertakenby the last Government. But it also containsprovision for new support to eg inter-nationally mobile projects, rising from  3million a year to about  11 million in1983-84.

Department of EnergyroductionFinancial support to the nationalised indus-s, mainly coal, and expenditure by the Atomicergy Authority (AEA) account for 80 per cent ofDepartment&apos;s total expenditure.

The AEA advise that increased expenditure onpressurised water reactor (PWR) safety is necessaryfollowing Ministers&apos; decision that the next nuclearpower station order should be for a PWR, subject tosafety and a public inquiry. The sums are not yetcertain. The bulk will be found from within theAEA&apos;s existing baseline but present estimates indi-cate a need for additional expenditure of around  2million a year. The AEA could find the sumrequired for 1981-82 from within their existingbaseline by deferring some expenditure on othervote-funded programmes. But they say they wouldbe unable to do so for 1982-83 and 1983-84 withoutfacing the difficult decisions identified in paragraph22. They therefore feel they could not commitexpenditure on this item in 1981-82 unlessadditional bids of  2 million were accepted for eachof the later years. This increase in the AEA&apos;s base-line would still leave the Department&apos;s total fore-casts for 1982-83 and 1983-84 below Cmnd. 7841after taking into account the reduced requirementsmentioned in paragraph 1S. It is proposed that theincrease in these years be made.8.

(This is because assistance to the coalindustry has been determined in relation tothe agreed overall financial strategy for theNCB; payments to the electricity industry inrespect of Drax B and to undertakings underthe Interest Relief Grant Scheme are contrac-tual commitments; and the Department&apos;sCentral and Miscellaneous Services provisionis subject to the 2 Vi per cent staff cutssqueeze.)22. As regards nuclear R&amp;D, the Atomic EnergyAuthority advise that the figures in the survey base-line will themselves entail some deferment ofprogrammes needed to support likely future:requirements for nuclear power, and that reduc-tions could only be made as a result of policy deci-sions on individual programmes. The main choices[would be made from the following areas:(a) running down the non-JET fusion workcarried out at Culham and weakening its roleas a centre of excellence in support of the JETproject, thus reducing one of the advantagesadduced to our European partners in supportof siting JET at Culham;(b) ruling out an early start on a CommercialDemonstration Fast Reactor or otherwisereducing our effort on the fast reactor, amajor policy area which Ministers are due toconsider;(c) postponing work on the development of tech-niques for processing and disposing of nuclearmaterials, despite the importance of this workfor the public acceptability of nuclear power,and/or(d) eliminating one or more other areas of workcarried out by the Atomic Energy Authoritywithin their underlying research programmewhich would weaken their support for thenuclear programme as a whole.23. Reductions in the non-nuclear R&amp;D budgetof the order shown above would mean a cut of morethan 14 per cent on a level of expenditure which isitself the result of severe reductions in the course oflast year&apos;s savings exercise. At least one of the majorareas of departmental R&amp;D work would have to becurtailed or abandoned. Some of these are much inthe public eye, such as work on renewable energysources or coal liquefaction. Others are concernedwith our most significant present source of energy,North Sea oil. There would clearly be priorities tobe set, but reductions of this order would mean forexample:  no departmental support for further work oncoal liquefaction  or the termination of work on one or more ofthe renewable sources of energy such as thewave power programme and undertaking nofurther geothermal deep drilling  or abandoning both our work on enhanced oilrecovery and R&amp;D support for the UK&apos;s off-shore supplies industry.24. The energy conservation baseline figures foreach of the three years in question have alreadybeen considerably reduced to reflect the slower thanexpected start to the Demonstration ProjectsScheme. The further reductions represent cuts ofup to almost 20 per cent and could only be accom-modated by severe curtailment or even abandon-ment of one or more of existing activities.

The Department of Trade&apos;s expenditure coversa number of small programmes including assistanceto tourism, export promotion, regulation of domes-tic trade, consumer protection, shipping and civilaviation services. Local authority expenditure onlocal airports and on consumer protection activitiesis included in the Department&apos;s programmes.Administration forms a substantial proportion ofthe expenditure under departmental control.Implications of the baseline figures2. The baseline figures reflect the planned level ofexpenditure on these activities set out in Cmnd7841 as a result of last year&apos;s survey. Some minorchanges involving switches between sub-programmes have been agreed with Treasury andCSD officials. These include reductions on exportpromotion services as a result of the decision tomove towards a higher level of cost recoveryfollowing the recent review of these services by SirDerek Rayner.control services. The additional bids in 1981-82and 1982-83 are due to the Authority&apos;s costs - andthus the size of the Eurocontrol deficit   havingincreased far more than was expected at the time ofthe 1979 survey.6.  The CAA borrows from the National Loans!Fund to finance capital investment. The additionalbids partly reflect the extent to which the CAA&apos;scapital programmes have in the past been restrictedby public expenditure constraints. Much of theCAA&apos;s air traffic control equipment is obsolescent,imposing increasingly heavy costs in both operatingand financial terms and some major projects needto be set in hand urgently (e.g. South East radareplacements and the re-equipment of the LondonAir Traffic Control Centre). The CAA propose tundertake foreign borrowing in later years andunder the terms of a new financial control system tbe introduced from  1981-82, the Authority&apos;foreign borrowing will be included in the publiexpenditure planning total.Revised economic assumptions3. Not applicable.Reduced requirements not included in baseline4. In addition to the effects of the cash limitsqueeze, there are small reduced requirements onconsumer protection in all years.Additional bids and offsetting savings5. The grant in aid to the Civil AviationAuthority (CAA) covers the deficit imposed on it byinternational agreements which prevent economiccharges for certain services and the deficit incurredon its functions relating to the Highlands andIslands aerodromes. The plans assume the inter-national constraints will have been removed by1983-84 thus allowing full cost recovery on Euro-7. The bids for local airports are to a considerablextent for projects previously held up by publiinquiries and referred to in the airport policy statement by the Secretary of State on 19 December.8.

Public expendi-irewould only be involved if ECGD faced a run ofeavy losses which totally exhausted its cashserves. This is not an immediate risk though itannot be discounted completely in present worldade conditions. But in addition ECGD is respon-for three public expenditure programmes,wo of these   the provision of loans and interestipport in connection with fixed rate exportiance  arise from matching our principal tradingipetitors who offer similar fixed rate extended&quot;edit terms. The former mainly involves ECGD inaking loans to banks to refinance a proportion ofeir fixed rate sterling export lending undertakenrespect of commitments entered into before 1pril 1980 whilst under the latter the banks obtainjcommercial rate of return on their fixed rateport lending.2. The third ECGD facility involving publicexpenditure is the cost escalation scheme. Thisprovides some protection against increases in cer-tain costs of completing export contracts for largecapital goods.3. The baselineAs a result of successive policy changes over the lastfew years (including the withdrawal of refinance fornew sterling commitments from April 1980), we areexpecting substantial net receipts of refinance overthe survey period as the total of loans outstanding isreduced. These receipts (ranging from over  300million in 1980-81 to rather under  200 million in1983-84) largely offset expenditure on interestsupport and cost escalation in the early years andproduce overall net reductions later. The higherlevel of receipts in 1980-81 reflects the agreementof the Trustee Savings Banks to take over a furtherNF1DENTIAL33
11.   Exports Credits Guarantee DepartmentCONFIDENTS 200 million of outstanding refinance in the currentyear. It is assumed that this refinance and that takenover in 1979-80 is held by the TSB&apos;s throughout theperiod.4. ChangesAll forecasts of expenditure under ECGD&apos;s pro-grammes have to be regarded as tentative, sincethey are demand responsive and highly sensitive tochanges in economic assumptions. In particular thecost of interest support is highly sensitive to marketinterest rates. If, for example, rates in any year were1 per cent above those assumed, this would addabout  50 million in that year to the programme.5. The changes on refinance reflect the latest esti-mates of outstanding sterling fixed rate exportcredits over the period. The changes in interestsupport costs reflect these latest estimates but areprimarily the result of new interest rate assump-tions. The higher expenditure expected under costescalation in the later years results from slippage inissue of agreements.6. Options for reductionsOptions for reductions cannot be counted on toguarantee net savings as these can be easilyoutweighed by changes in economic circumstancesoutside export credit policy.7. Three options can be identified:(i) Increasing the private sector&apos;s share of out-standing refinance;(ii) Raising the fixed rate of interest; and(iii) Withdrawing the cost escalation scheme.8. Option (i) may be possible, although mojstudy would be required to see whether there exted any private sector institutions prepared to talover more outstanding refinance. The TSBs haireached their limit for the time being at least. Tibanks themselves are now totally responsible fjproviding new finance, and so other institutioiwould have to be found. No particular savings citherefore be assumed.9. Turning to option (ii) agreement has just be)reached internationally to raise fixed interest ratby an amount equivalent to \ per cent formarkets. The savings therefore achieved are sho\|as reduced requirements. A unilateral increaseour fixed rates would achieve further savings, blthat (unlike the agreement just reached) woidamage our exporters9 competitiveness.10. Option (iii) would not produce spec!savings on the present baseline because the fo.casts of expenditure on cost escalation doinclude costs which may be incurred in respectfuture business for which ECGD has not yet beapproached for cover. Estimating the additio;bids likely to be required if the scheme continbeyond 1981 is difficult but at best the effectsexpenditure would be likely to be neutral anpresent trends were to continue could involve cdmitments of the order shown in the table at presfor 1981 -82 and 1982-83 extending into later yea]11. Options (i) and (ii) would involve administive changes. As for option (iii), ECGD&apos;s presstatutory authority for providing cost escaialjwill expire on 26 March 1981 unless it is reneby Order.34CONFIDEN

For general labour market services, whichinclude the special temporary employment scheme,community industry and the careers service, andalso for the services for seriously disabled peoplewhich cover sheltered employment, the base linefigures provide for the continuation broadly of thelevels of services in 1980-81 except that the pro-vision for community industry covers 6,000 filledplaces in 1980-81 and 5,500 in 1981-82 onwards.The level for the special temporary employmentprogramme is 12 14,000 filled places. The specialemployment services programme allows for appli-cations to be accepted for the job release andtemporary short time working schemes only up to31 March 1981. Provision for the Advisory,Conciliation and Arbitration Service, and for theHealth and Safety Executive reflects the reductionsin staffing of 11% and 6% respectively noted inCmnd 7841.3. As a consequence of the lower staffing levelsnoted in Cmnd 7841 the baseline figures for theManpower Services Commission (MSC) provide forreductions in the specialised employment servicesalthough the standard of the general placing servicewill be maintained. The number of jobcentres isplanned to rise from 645 in April 1980 to 995 in1983-84 and the network should be completed inthe following year. Provision for the youth oppor-tunities programme, which is subject to annualreview, allows for some 102,000 filled places in1980-81 and 80,000 thereafter. Cuts in MSC expen-diture as well as in staffing have resulted in reducedtraining volumes for the training opportunitiesscheme. The numbers trained will fall from 67,000to 60,000 between 1980-81 and 1983-84. Part ofthe provision for grants for training in industry hasbeen allocated provisionally to vocational prepara-tion pending Ministerial decisions on the future ofthis form of training.4. The baseline provides for the followingadditions to the revalued programme totals inCmnd 7841: the cost from 1981-82 of raising Re]dundancy Fund rebates from 41% to 50%, the cosof HMSO services for the department in 1979-8and later years, and in all years the sum dpayments to non-Crown bodies made by thdepartment as agent for the European Social Fund.jAdditional bids1.

Almost the whole of Department of Transportexpenditure is classified as roads and transport, theinly significant exception being expenditure onJriverand vehicle licensing which, being essentiallyitax collection function, is classified as tax and ratecollection in &quot;other public services.&quot; In this contextexpenditure of some  50 million permits the collec-i of about  1,400 million vehicle excise duties.eductions of about 2,500 staff were announced byle Lord President in December 1979, reducing theepartment&apos;s manpower costs by about 18 per centver 3 years.About half the expenditure on the roads andransport programme is incurred by local authori-ses and the rest by central government. Roughly a1 of the local authority expenditure is capital(penditure, principally on roads and publicansport investment; the remainder is currentKpenditure, mainly on road maintenance, revenuepport for public transport, concessionary faresnd administration. About two-fifths of centralvemment expenditure is for road constructionand maintenance; most of the rest is for support totransport industries, chiefly British Rail. Cashlimits are applied to local authority borrowing, togovernment grants to local authorities and toalmost all central government expenditure.3. The main charges in the programme are for theoperation of car parks by local authorities and forsuch services as driving tests and vehicle testsadministered by central government.Motorways and trunk roads4. Three quarters of the expenditure is on theconstruction and improvement of motorways andtrunk roads. The remainder is current expenditure,almost all on road maintenance. Total spending onmotorways and trunk roads has been reduced bymore than 35 per cent over the last five years.Implications of baseline figures5. For the years 1980-81 to 1983-84 the baselineis as in Cmnd 7841. Expenditure on motorway andtrunk road construction is planned to declineNFIDENTIAL39
13.  Department of TransportCONFIDENTSslightly, and on maintenance to remain broadlystable over the period.6. The implications for the motorway and trunkroad construction programme are set out in detailin the 1980 Roads White Paper (Cmnd 7908).Nearly half the provision for major schemes duringthis period is already contractually committed. Theremaining provision will be sufficient to permitonly contracts for high priority schemes to be let,requiring the deferment of schemes with potentiallyhigh rates of economic return or providing valuableenvironmental benefits. For example, in 1981-82schemes with a total cost of about  390 million andproviding a total net return of about  600 millionwould be ready to start; however, the baselinefigures will only permit starts to be made on about 290 million worth of these schemes. In the surveyperiod as a whole new starts will be restricted to theM2S London orbital road and a few other majorindustrial routes, such as the A1/Ml link, routes tothe Haven Ports and the extension of theM180/A18 to Immingham. The completion ofmany badly needed by-passes will be put back to1990 and beyond.7. The baseline provision for motorway and trunkroad maintenance underlying Cmnd 7841 is at aslightly higher level than previously planned. It is,however, still unlikely to be sufficient to meet therequirements for increased maintenance and recon-struction of the motorway network in the next fewyears.Additional bids8. The earlier motorways are now reaching theend of their design lives. Because of increases in theaxle weights of commercial vehicles, and theconcentration on motorways of increases in theflow of heavy vehicles, some are needing recon-struction several years earlier than had beenexpected. On average, 80 miles will require recon-struction each year, at a cost of approximately  1million a mile. The baseline provision is sufficientfor only 50 miles a year. An expanding programmeis therefore needed and additional provision issought as follows:  million1981-82	1982-83	1983-84 &apos;10	15	15Offsetting savings cannot be found from elsewhetwithin the Department&apos;s programme.9.  The Minister of Transport has accepted th|recommendation, made in the report of the studyRoad Construction Units (carried out in consulttion with Sir Derek Rayner), that the RCsub-units should be phased out. The process ;likely to start in 1980-81 and end in 1982-83. Martof the staff of RCU sub-units are local govemmeofficials   on   secondment.   Liability   for thjredundancy payments (other than those falling o[their superannuation fund) for those no longejrequired by their parent authorities will fall on thlDepartment.   The  baseline  figures  make nflallowance for these costs, for which addition!provision is required. Preliminary estimates of thlamounts involved are:    millij1981-821982-8310. The   Department   has   in   recent yearsincreased, from savings in its own programmes, thCentral Office of Information&apos;s provision for roa!safety publicity.

confidential13.   Department of Transport13. The local transport capital programmeincludes road schemes receiving 100 per cent grantfrom central government, roads constructed byNew Town Development Corporations, theDepartment of Transport&apos;s contribution to theurban programme, and resources for projects suchbsthe Humber Bridge. Apart from these items, andfrom the declining expenditure on the Tyne andWear Metro, the amount available for capitalxpenditure by local authorities will remainmadly stable through the period at a level aboutlalf that of the mid-1970&apos;s. The baseline figurespake no allowance for possible links to new airportievelopments. Nor will they be sufficient to allowincreases in expenditure on the scale which someauthorities, particularly the GLC, considernecessary. For example, for 1980-81 less than halfof local authorities&apos; plans for new capital projectscan be accommodated within  the resourcesivailable.4, The plans for current expenditure include a[percent reduction in road maintenance expendi-Inrebetween 1980-81 and 1981-82: a fall of 24 pertent in local authority transport administrationbween 1979-80 and 1982-83 (likely to involve aloss of about 4,300 jobs); and a reduction in thelumber of, and fall in the value of, concessionaryIres schemes. A reduction in public transportubsidies of 21 per cent over the same period is alsolanned. This will contribute to rises in bus fares ofbout 6 per cent a year in real terms; as will thebasing out of new bus grant (see paragraph 22elow). An increase of  7 million has beenrovisionally set aside in 1983-84 in anticipation ofressures for higher levels of revenue support,articularly in rural areas.educed Requirementsp. Revised information has become availablenice the cash limits were calculated of theovement of prices between November 1978 andovember 1979. The effect of this, taken together th the latest forecasts of price movements&apos;tween November 1979 and 1980-81, is to reducepe volume equivalent of the cash limit forMtorways and trunk roads in 1980-81 to  18pillion below the baseline figure.entral Government support to transport industriesritish RailThe largest item is grant to British Rail. Thisreflects the Government&apos;s obligation to reimburseBritish Rail for operating a certain level ofpassenger services. This level is fixed by referenceto the scale of services provided in 1974 when thepresent system of grant was instituted. Other grantsinclude contributions to the cost of replacing assetsused in the passenger rail business; towards the costof level crossings; and in respect of the Board&apos;shistoric pension liabilities. The figure for the lattergrant reflects the revised method of supportprovided for in the current Transport Bill.Implications of baseline figures17. The provision for support for British Railpassenger services is the same as Cmnd.7841. Sincethe ceiling on the level of support was fixed in realterms in 1975, British Rail have managed to keepwithin the survey provision, but the Board now faceincreasing difficulty in holding down their supportrequirement to the required level. In part thisreflects reductions from the 1975 level of supportmade by this and the previous Government. By1979-80 these totalled  37 million and the baselineimplies a further reduction of  46 million by1983-84. But it also reflects the fact that the cost ofrunning the railways has been increasing in realterms since 1977. Significant improvements inlabour productivity in addition to real fareincreases will be necessary to meet the reducing linein Cmnd. 7841. Service reductions are also apossibility.Additional bid18. The Board are proposing to strengthen theirpolice force so that it can deal more effectively withthe pressing problem of violence and hooliganismon trains and at stations, at a cost of about   1 &apos;2million a year. An additional bid of  1 million ineach year from 1981 -82 onwards is included underBritish Rail passenger subsidies to contribute to thisextra expenditure on law and order.National Freight Corporation19. Payments to the National Freight Corporation(NFC) are split into two separate categories: grantfor the cost of travel concessions and NationalCarriers capital expenditure requirements (thelatter due to end in 1981); and grant to assist thecorporation to discharge its rail-based pensionobligations reflecting the new method of supportprovided for in the Transport Bill.onfidential41
13.   Department of TransportCONFIDENTIAL20. Under the legislation the Minister will beempowered to convert NFC into a limited companyand sell shares in it to the public. Both the travelconcessions grant and support for historic rail-based pension obligations will continue to be paidto the successor company.Other grants21. Grants are payable under the Railways Act1974 towards the cost of providing rail freighthandling facilities and wagons in cases wheretransfer of traffic from road to rail will produceworthwhile environmental benefits, and where thefacilities in question are not owned by the RailwaysBoard.22. The provision for new bus grant to national-ised industries and private operators declinessteadily over the period, reflecting the Govern-ment&apos;s announced intention to phase out the grantby March 1984.Ports and shipping23. This sub-programme covers investment bythe public trust ports and by local authorityharbours on port facilities, together with loans toports in the private sector. The investment coversdevelopment of new projects and improvements ofexisting facilities, and is geared to continuingcustomer requirements and the needs of industry ingeneral. A substantial proportion of the work isconnected with North Sea oil and oil-related activi-ties. The expenditure also reflects the growth ofcontainer traffic and of roll-on/roll-off ferry facili-ties to Europe.24. The provision also includes grants to be madeto the Port of London Authority from centralgovernment towards the cost of staff severances,under the provisions of the Port of LondonAuthority (Financial Assistance) Bill now beforeParliament.Other transport services25. This item includes expenditure on centralgovernment adminstration, transport research andcertain minor items. Provision has also been madefor receipt of fees for services such as driving testsand vehicle tests.Tax and rate collection: driver and vehicle licensing26. This sub-programme covers expenditure ondriver and vehicle licensing and registration and thcollection of driver licence fees and motor vehiclexcise duties. All revenue received in respect cdriver licence fees and vehicle excise dutiesaccounted for separately and paid into the MotTax Account held at the Bank of England for th[Consolidated Fund.

A 2 per cent reduction in the Departmen.programmes^ including driver and vehicle licening, in 1981-82 would total  55 million and a 3 pcent reduction in subsequent years  80 million,possible allocation for these reductions is shownTable 13.The implications of reductions at these levels adiscussed in the following paragraphs. It is npossible to identify with certainty optionsreductions on driverand vehicle licensing (see pagraph 35); if such savings were required from tDepartment&apos;s programmes, it would be necessaryreduce expenditure on roads and local transporta further  1 million a year. However, in the Depament&apos;s view there could be no case for reduciexpenditure on the provision of transport infstructure in support of essential transport servito meet the costs of tax collection.29. There is no prospect of savings frmotorway and trunk road maintenance. On nconstruction, as is noted in paragraph 6,42
13.  Department of Transport.present baseline permits new starts only on highpriority schemes. For example, in 1981-82 the[amount available for new schemes will be abouti 40 million; of this,   15 million will be required fornew M25 contracts and about the same amount forother category I schemes, such as the M27 aroundSouthampton and the Ipswich bypass on the routeto the East Coast ports. A reduction in expenditureon new construction would therefore necessitatethe deferment of more schemes with high economicand environmental benefits, to many of which theGovernment is already publicly committed. Thiswould run counter to the Government&apos;s aim ofprotecting investment in infrastructure of impor-tance to the economy; and it would have seriousimplications for the already hard-pressed construc-tion industry.30, Similar considerations apply to capital expen-diture on local transport as to spending on trunkroads. Local road-building is necessary to connectpith new trunk roads, industrial estates and otherDevelopments as well as to remove bottlenecks andimprove safety. The resources available already fallwell short of local authorities&apos; aspirations. Forexample, for 1980-81 sufficient funds will beavailable for starts to be made on only about 40miles of new local roads in England. Much the sameis true also of public transport investment; mostlontracts for new buses to be delivered in 1981-82are already finalised; and about  75 million of otherpublic transport investments already committed inLondon and on the Tyne and Wear Metro alone.In practice, therefore, the Department wouldhave to look to local authority current expenditureto provide the main part of any necessaryreduction. There must be considerable doubt as towhether the local authorities would achieve morethan is already being asked of them. If they did itpld almost certainly mean further increases inus fares beyond those indicated in paragraph 12hove.32. The baseline provision for support for BritishRail (excluding the pension funds) assumes aprogressive reduction, which reaches  62 million ayear by 1982-83 compared with the 1975 level. TheBoard are likely to have severe problems inachieving this, given the prospect of rising real wageand fuel costs and ageing assets. The further reduc-tions illustrated above would almost certainlyentail further real fare increases and reductions inlevel or quality of services, possibly including someclosures, since full credit has already been taken inthe baseline figures for such improvements inproductivity as it is realistic to forecast. Dependingon the Board&apos;s success in reducing operating coststhe baseline figures would imply real fare increasesof perhaps 2 per cent each year. The further reduc-tion illustrated above might be expected to increasethis to 5 or 6 per cent each year, in addition toreductions in quality or level of service. No furtherreductions in support for British Rail pension fundswould be possible, since under the Transport Billthe Minister will be statutorily obliged to make thepayments shown. And if such a cut were made theBoard would find it even more difficult to find theresources needed to strengthen their police force.33. The reductions in port investment shownabove could entail the slowing down of projectsconnected with the development of North Sea oil orwith the growing trade with Europe.34. Reductions of the required size in respect ofdriver and vehicle licensing would need either areduction in enforcement, which would becounter-productive as a much greater amount oftax would be lost, or further changes in theoperation of vehicle excise duty over and abovethose for which amending legislation is currentlybeing taken.

The treatment oflion mortgage subsidy is under discussion; for the purpose of this table it is as the Treasury have proposed to the department.The main table shows the baseline figures (re-alued to 1980 survey prices) which resulted fromhe public expenditure review concluded lastebruary. For 1980-81 a single block capital alloca-tor) has been made to each lorcal authority underhe Housing Investment Programme (HIP) system;I is for each local authority to decide how itsocation will be spent. The subsidy provision issed on a rent guideline of an average increase of&apos;50 cash for the year 1980-81 and of 60p cash for(ie second half of that year; a 32 per cent increaseall. Averaged over the year, this is an increase of[percent. For 1981-82 and for each of the follow-g two years a single figure is shown, since novisions have yet been taken about how the totalrovision is to be distributed in each of these years.k necessary decisions will fall to be made in theutumn preceding each year.2. The Housing Bill will abolish the arrangementwhereby local authorities reimburse DHSS for thenotional rent rebate and allowance content ofsupplementary benefits. The consequent PESCtransfer to DHSS (Programme 12) has been made,pending future decisions on rent levels, on anotional assumption that rents rise in line withprices.Background3. The present review takes place against thefollowing housing background;(i) The Inherited Plans have been very sub-stantially reduced by 40 per cent for1981-82 and 50 per cent for 1982-83.(ii) The capital allocations made to localauthorities for 1980-81 did little more than
14.  Department of the Environment   HousingCONFIDENTScover their existing commitments; the allo-cations were in real terms 33 per cent belowthose made by the present administrationfor 1979-80.(iii) Taken together the housing capital alloca-tions made to local authorities, the HousingCorporation and new towns for 1980-81 arein real terms 21 per cent less than the esti-mated outturn for 1979-80.(iv) Housebuilding completions in the publicsector are now at the lowest level since thewar and will decline further as the fall inapprovals works through. Private house-building will also almost certainly declinethis year; future prospects are uncertain.(v) Mortgage lending has had to be completelysuspended by 50 local authorities includingthe GLC (except for a small amount onhome steading); and another 25 havesuspended mortgage lending for house pur-chase.(vi) Discretionary improvement grants to pri-vate individuals have also had to besuspended by some local authorities.4. In the department&apos;s view it is not realistic toattempt to forecast how much housing provision isneeded year by year but the following facts shouldbe noted:(i) We have been losing 30,000 to 40,000dwellings each year on average throughslum clearance or demolition or for otherreasons. Perhaps another 30,000 have beenbecoming irretrievably unfit each year.(ii) There are at present some 1,500,000 sub-standard dwellings in the stock; somerequire replacement, most can beimproved.(iii) There are considerable numbers of dwell-ings vacant or underused. However, over60 per cent of the vacant dwellings arevacant for reasons to do with their condi-tion.(iv) The net annual increase in the number ofhouseholds has been about 150,000 two-thirds of these being single person house-holds.By contrast:(v) Housebuilding starts in 1980 may amountto about 45,000 in the public sector and100,000 in the private sector.(vi) Improvements of dwellings in the publicand private sector together were running a155,000 in 1979.While it is government policy to encourage thprivate provision of housing both through owneoccupation and private renting, it is not possible tmake a realistic forecast of the extent to whichousing needs will be met by those means.Effect on capital expenditure provision of reii,policy5. The total available for capital expenditure ifuture years within the overall provision fohousing will depend on the level of subsidies, whicin turn will depend on the level of rents. Decisioon rent guidelines will be taken year by year. In thjdepartment&apos;s view speculation about rent increasover the survey period is pointless. But in detemining rent guidelines each autumn the depament considers that Ministers may wish to taaccount of the effect of rent increases on inflatioand on wage expectations. The more importaconsiderations of this kind become, the greater tsqueeze on capital expenditure within the singline for housing.6. The Treasury point out that by the time tprevious Government left office unrebated reniwere a lower proportion of earnings than at atime for at least twenty years (average unrebatrents in 1979-80 are estimated to be some  6-50 pweek, about 6-6 per cent of earnings), and the rerebate system provides relief to the less well off.Revised economic assumptions and reduced requirments7. Changes in economic assumptions (chieinterest rates) affect housing subsidies and optimortgages and those made since Cmnd. 7841 w.fall to be discussed within agreed rules as decisioon the distribution of housing expenditure ajreached each autumn. Under the agreemereached in the 1979 survey, changes in the requiments for housing subsidies as a result of changeseconomic assumptions will be dealt with by equivjlent increases or decreases in the baseline. Ttreatment of changes in requirements for optijmortgage subsidy resulting from changes in econ]mic assumptions or in tax rates is under discussionAdditional bids8. There are undoubtedly areas where additioflbids would help to meet urgent needs, such as inf^46CONFIDENT!

Further savings would mean either morereductions in an already inadequate capital pro-gramme or further rent increases, which theDepartment believes to be impracticable. TheDepartment considers therefore that no moresavings are to be found.10. The Treasury consider that reductions of thisorder would best be achieved by approximatelyequal reductions in subsidies and in expenditure onnew build, and on improvement includingimprovement grants to individuals.

About 90 per cent of expenditure is on officesand storage. The remainder is maintenance, minorworks and some other services for courts, specialhospitals and other specialised acccommodation.Nearly 90 per cent of the total is current expendi-ture; the proportion spent on fuel etc has beenrising because of changes in relative prices.Implications of the baseline figures2. The baseline represents overall a very substan-tial reduction on the 1979 PES baseline, .adjustedfor policy changes on dispersal etc. The size of thecuts in percentage terms is as follows:Major new worksMinor new worksRepairs and maintenanceFurniture and equipmentRents .1981-82 1982-83% cut %cutA large part of the expenditure is committed;cannot be significantly reduced in the short tework in progress under existing contracts,payable under existing leases, fuel and utilitieexisting buildings, provision for basic upkeeprepair of the estate including landlords* chaThe percentage cuts shown embody all the roo48CONFIDENT
CONFIDENTIALmanoeuvre available. The critical problems there-fore arise on new works.&apos;3. Only about two-thirds of the known high-priority major new works projects can be financedfrom the provision now in the programme; and onpast experience other urgent work will be identifiedand need to be carried out before the end of theperiod. Within the present provision it is expectedthat priority will be given to urgent defence,Security and computerisation projects, rather thanto other operational requirements or improvementsand relief of overcrowding. Discussions have beenheld on how far departments can make fundsmailable to PSA to carry out more schemes, sometransfers have already been agreed and a combina-ion of transfers and re-arrangement of plannedtarts should enable the most essential work so fardentified to proceed within the survey period.Imilar priorities will apply to minor new worksnd there will be virtually no funds available after1980-81 for works related to energy conservationnd rationalisation of the estate.The furniture and equipment provision repre-&apos;ents a reduction of about 35 per cent on the1979-80 outturn. Much of the remaining provisionill be needed for fitting out courts and other newuilding projects, leaving little in the survey periodor normal replacement of worn out or obsolete&apos;terns. If continued at the current level, therevision, even if spent wholly on replacement,&apos;ould require items of furniture to last for over 40ears.Rents, maintenance and running costs are dueo be further reduced by  23 million by 1983-84.avings from civil service manpower cuts will ofourse lead to reductions in the size of the officestate, but economies will only occur when itecomes feasible to give up disposable blocks ofeased accommodation, or sell off Crown-owneduildings. And allowance must be made for theime and cost involved in regrouping staff toroduce units of space that can be reallocated orisposed of. Some further savings may be possiblen energy from more efficient plant operationIthough the best opportunities have already beenken and allowed for in the figures. On mainten-nce, most avoidable work including decorationis already been stopped, and it will be necessary tooslpone major repairs and renewals of services like15.   Department of the Environment   PSAlifts, heating and air-conditioning plant andstructural items like roofs. There will be some riskof failures of services; the existing backlog of work,if not overcome, means that some buildings maybecome unusable, whilst many will show signs ofdilapidation. Owners of leased buildings (60 percent of the office estate) may not be prepared totolerate default on repairing obligations. The fuelprovision may prove inadequate, particularly givena severe winter, and if existing minimum heatingstandards are to be maintained, cuts would have tobe made elsewhere.6. In addition to the cost of the office programme,&quot;departmental administration&quot; covers the design ofnew specialised buildings funded by otherprogrammes. The provision for consultants&apos; fees iscurrently insufficient to cover all projects nowplanned. Amongst work which is likely to be heldup in the absence of extra provision is theprogramme to start two new prison buildings ineach year.7. The conclusion is that the cuts that have beenmade in this programme have resulted in a situa-tion where the operational needs of departmentsmay not be adequately met and where thegovernment office estate and other specialisedbuildings may no longer be properly kept up andrepaired. There will be considerable difficulties inrationalising the estate and disposing of surplusproperties as the size of the civil service is reduced,and there will be no funds for energy-savingmeasures requiring capital investment.Option cuts8. Further cuts on current expenditure wouldinvolve cuts on maintenance more severe thanthose already required, with increased risks ofbuildings becoming unserviceable and, probably,non-compliance with standards laid down instatutory requirements. It is unrealistic tocontemplate cuts on these items, or any furtherreductions in furniture and equipment. Smallsavings might be found on transport and custodyservices but in practice the bulk of any cut wouldhave to fall on new works involving possibly thecancellation of one-third of all remaining majornew works. This would leave barely enough money0NF1DENTIAL49
15.   Department of the Environment   PSACONFIDENTIALto undertake major items of the highest operationalpriority such as computerisation of PA YE andDHSS work, and some essential work on regionaland local offices including relief of overcrowdingfor Departments like DHSS, Customs and Excise,MAFF and Employment could not be funded.9. Thus the overall effect of the option cuts wouldbe increased failure to meet operational needs. Bythe end of the survey period difficulties wouldbecome more acute as repair or replacement ofbuildings, furniture, equipment, electrical servicesetc could no longer be deferred whilst dilapidationpayments to landlords got larger, and work couldonly be financed at the expense of the remainingnew works projects.Additional bid10.  It is clear from the assessment in paragraph^5   7   above  that  the  provision  for repairsmaintenance and minor works is inadequate. It maybe possible to hold the position at this 1temporarily but by the later years of the surveyperiod the effect on the operational needs odepartments and on the fabric of the estate coulprove increasingly serious. Allowing for reductionin staff and in the size of the estate, a provision o 10 million in each of the years of the period woulgo some way towards offsetting the worst effects!and an additional bid is made for this purpose,the Treasury view however the totality of th.existing   provision   for   capital   and currenexpenditure should be sufficient to meet require]ments.50CONFIDENT!

Some authorities haveshown what they think is &quot;realistically available&quot;rather than what they consider to be the real need.2. In this programme the Government&apos;s prioritiesare to meet urgent public health needs, newindustrial development and new housing, whilemaintaining the general standard of service. Thelevel of expenditure provided in Cmnd. 7841 wasconsidered the absolute minimum necessary in theshort term to maintain the system and in general tomeet these priorities. The possibility was recog-nised that additional expenditure on the renewal ofsewers and water mains might be required towardsthe end of the period.3. Despite searching in-house appraisals by waterauthorities (for example Wessex have reduced theirprogramme by 30 per cent), their 1980 plans inaggregate show a higher level of planned expendi-ture from 1981-82 reflecting their assessment of theminimum investment requirements to preserve andreplace their asset stock, to provide for increaseddemand from existing consumers, to provide thenecessary infrastructure for firm proposals for newdevelopment and to prevent or minimise deteriora-tion in river water quality. Their programmesinclude provision for progress towards meeting therequirements of EEC Directives (e.g on the qualityof bathing waters) and for some improvement in thereliability and quality of piped water supplies.4. The cash limit squeeze in 1979-80 forced thewater authorities to cut back in letting newcontracts so that, whilst they kept just within thecash limit, the latest estimate of volume expendi-ture shows a shortfall of some  35 million. Forconfidential!1980-81, the revaluation factor used to determinethe cash limit now looks to be too low. whilst inaddition authorities budgeted down to keep withinthe limit. The effect of these two factors is thatanother severe volume squeeze is now possible for1980-81.

Local authorities&apos; views on priorities and theirability to supplement borrowing approvals withrevenue and capital fund finance (which have led tothe new controls system) have resulted in recentyears in substantial overspends against the PESCprovisions for LES; around  200 million in1977-78,  170 million in 1978-79, and  25million- 27 million (estimated) in 1979-80 (1980survey prices). The reduced overspend in 1979-80reflects an increase of  94 million in the PESCprovision for 1979-80 onwards. The locally deter-mined sector borrowing allocation (which coversmost LES capital expenditure) was reduced from 169 million in 1978-79 to  100 million in1979-80 (outturn prices) and for 1980-81 remainsstable in real terms at   115 million (outturn prices).However, LES spending has, as the table aboveshows, been reduced substantially in recent years  by over 50 per cent in real terms between 1975-76and 1979-80   following successive reductions inthe borrowing allocation.1*1. The pressures of adjustment to the newcontrol system may be particularly severe on theLES provision in view of the substantially reducedprovision (in relation to current reduced spendinglevels) reflected in Cmnd. 7841. Given the need toidential53

Cmnd. 7841 provides for further substan-tial cuts in all these services.12. Coast protection and derelict land reclama-tion (which attract particularly high rates ofgovernment grant and borrowing for which is atpresent subject to specific control) will be includedin the other services block for expenditure controlpurposes but grant will be paid only in respect ofspecifically approved schemes. After significantunderspending since 1976-77, reflecting the delayto the build up of the programme following thecapital moratorium of 1976-77, spending onderelict land reclamation in 1979-80 is expected tobe close to the cash limit of  23-5 million (outturnprices). From 1981-82 there will be pressure forincreased spending on this programme in accor-dance with the Government&apos;s policy of concentrat-ing resources on industrial regeneration in rundown urban and industrial areas. Specific assistancefrom within DOE programmes of some  2m peryear throughout this period has already been agreedin connection with the closure of Consett Steel-works (scheduled for the late summer 1980).13. Despite a substantial increase in the CoastProtection provision for 1978-79 and later years, itis becoming increasingly difficult to hold expendi-ture down to the levels of earlier years. Severe stormdamage in successive winters has resulted in plansfor extensive repairs and new works, and many ofthe new works, and many of the works constructedin the 1950s under the 1949 Coast Protection Actare now reaching the end of their useful lives.14. The Department consider that an additionalprovision of  7 million a year is needed for essentialcoast protection work.

16.   Department of Environment   OtherCONFIDENTIThe Urban programme24. The Urban Programme is a rolling pro-gramme which gives rise to continuous build-up ofongoing commitments, mainly from current expen-diture projects (which account for 20-25 percent ofall expenditure each year), but also from phasedcapital projects. 1979-80 was the first full year ofthe &quot;expanded&quot; Urban Programme (involvingpartnership and programme authority arrange-ments and agreed 3 year Inner Areas Programmes).Spending on new schemes did not build up asexpected and as there was relatively little carry-overfrom the previous year, the programme in 1979-80is expected to underspend by around  38 millionagainst the cash limit of  173 million (i.e an under-spend of 22%).25. However, the increase of expenditure in1979-80 over previous years implies a high level ofcommitted expenditure in 1980-81 and followingyears, with the result that the proportion of thePESC provision available for new projects willdecline from about 44 per cent in 1980-81 to 28 percent in 1983-84.26.

The privatisation of the Hydraulics ResearchStation is under consideration. This would involvethe transfer of public sector assets to the neworganisation, the provision of a capital base tolaunch it as a going concern, and the transfer ofaccrued pension rights. The Treasury do not feelthat this proposal has been satisfactorily worked outand do not consider an additional bid for thispurpose should be entertained in the absence of amuch stronger case than has so far been made out.Environmental bodies40.

As a result of the recent White Paper reviewthe Development Commission&apos;s allocation hasbeen cut by  5 million (from  15 million to  10million at 1979 Survey prices) for 1981 /82 and lateryears. This will involve a substantial reduction inthe Commission&apos;s factory building programme andCOSIRA&apos;s credit services to small industries inrural areas.

The Department has not identified specificoptions for the savings required to achievereductions of 2 per cent for 1981 -82 and 3 per centfor later years. It has suggested for the moment thatoption savings should be considered on a flat-ratebasis. The Treasury regards this approach asCONFIDENTIunsatisfactory.

Administration of justiceIn 1978, the number of defendants proceededagainst for indictable offences in magistrates&apos; courtswas similar to the number in 1977 and the numberproceeded against for non-indictable offences fellby about 4 per cent but it is as yet too early to saywhether this variation constitutes sufficient evi-dence to revise previous assessments of the need forthe present planned increase in expenditure onmagistrates&apos; courts of 3 per cent a year. The base-line figures for capital cover the small number ofmajor starts provided for in Cmnd. 7841 andrestrictions will continue to be imposed on minorworks schemes. This will mean no significantimprovement either in the services provided by themagistrates&apos; courts or in waiting time.6. Treatment of offendersPrisonsThe daily average inmate population in 1979-80was about 42220 and is forecast to rise to about43,500 in 1983-84 (or some 700 below the forecastin Cmnd. 7841). On any one day the populationmay vary from these figures by 1,000 or so: inMarch 1980 it rose to a peak of 44,800. The base-line provision for manpower is considered by theHome Office to be insufficient to maintainnecessary standards of regime and control whilstmeeting new commitments arising from theexpansion of the courts and the increased numberof prison places. The baseline figures for capitalprovision will allow completion of buildingschemes already in progress to provide 3,400 newor refurbished places, and for starts on two newprisons in each of the years 1981-82 onwards (thisrepresents an addition of one start in 1983-84 overthe planned programme in Cmnd. 7841). It is un-likely that overcrowding will be much reduced bythis programme before the late 1980s.7. Probation and after-careThere is provision for the number of probationofficers (excluding about 600 officers working inprisons and other establishments and about 900CONFIDENTSofficers under training) to rise from 4,800 i1979-80 to over 5,200 by March 1984; and foriincrease from 1,418 to 1,627 places in adult prbation and bail hostels, and for some expansion)other non-custodial forms of treatment. There issmall programme of new probation offices,envisaged in Cmnd. 7841.8. General protective servicesPoliceThe policy of successive Governments (paragra;2.9.20 of Cmnd. 7841) has been that, if the numbof police officers exceeds the estimated growtprovision will be made for the expenditureadditional manpower within authorised establisments, and essential associated expenditureequipment, training and other support services. Itassumed that Ministers will continue this polioPolice recruitment remains high and wastarelatively low; as a result, growth has broug&apos;strength at 31st March 1980 to 114,600, or 1,0above the figure in Cmnd. 7841. This growthexpected to continue and to reach 118,000 byMarch 1981 and 122,000 by 31 March 1981a122,000 by 31 March 1984 (2,000 above the Cm7841 forecast). Growth of this order represents,the Home Office view, the minimum possiireflection of this aspect of the Government comm;ment to strengthen the law and order services.9. The full cost of the additional police manpoand supporting goods and services covered by tcaveat on recruitment, and assuming an increase2,500 in the authorised establishment of policemby March 1984, is  40 million in 1981-82 risingj 41 million in 1983-84; of this  5 million1982-83 and  14 million in 1983-84 is to coverexpected increases in force establishments. Buteffect of other estimating changes, mainly involvilower forecasts of police pensions, is thatadditional cost can be met within the subaseline figures.10. There were 42,950 civilian staff employed31 March 1980. 1,050 below the strength assuin Cmnd. 7841. Strength is likely to rise to 45,by 1983-84 (600 below the figure assumedCmnd. 7841).11. The small programme of major schemescapital expenditure will be contained withinlevels of Cmnd. 7841.12. Fire servicesThe programme for 1980-81 provides forexislevels of fire cover to be maintained. Forremaining years, the figures assume thatauthorities will reduce their standard of fire cove62CONFIDENT

The capital expenditure figures allownail building programme and for necessaryplacement of old appliances.Civil defencepvision has been increased above Cmnd. 7841els following the decision taken by Ministers in^rch to make some improvements in the level ofpreparedness. The additional expenditure hasen met from within the baseline for other Home&quot;ce services. Studies are continuing into otherectsof civil defence and it is possible that theselead to further proposals for expenditure&apos;ich, if accepted, could not be accommodatedhin the baseline.Community servicesprogramme allows for the Commission forcial Equality and the Equal Opportunitiesmmission to continue at broadly their present:ls of activity, and provides for the current pro-mme for reception and resettlement of refugeesin Vietnam.Central and miscellaneous servicesebaseline figures provide for a small increase in[numbers of staff operating immigration control.Additional bidsere is an additional bid for expenditure on|0ns mainly to meet the cost of 500 additionalon officers a year and to improve maintenancejXisting buildings. This in part reflects the Homejce view that there is insufficient staff tojntain necessary standards of control and regimeIst meeting new commitments and in partbets the initial assessment by the Home Office of&apos;ernment&apos;s minimal response to the Report ofquiry under Mr Justice May.  million19X1-825-51982-831983-849-2The Treasury and CSD note that the Maymittee raised the question of the productivityfeon officers and doubted the efficiency of thecation of manpower. Additional provision forher 500 prison officers a year would exacerbate-problems, measured against the lower forecasterageprison population.18.  Options for red uctionsReductions of 2 percent in 1981-82 and 3 percentin the later years would amount to about  52million and  81 million respectively. The tablebelow sets out a series of options which illustratethe action required to secure the relevant totals.While the ground rules for this survey do notacknowledge any priority programmes, the HomeOffice emphasise that to implement any option inthe law and order sector accounting for 80 percent of total provision  would run counter to thecommitments stated in Cmnd. 7841. The HomeOffice see no practical way of achieving savings inany of these manpower-intensive areas. As to thefire services, the achievement of savings over andabove those already envisaged in Cmnd.7841 woulddepend heavily upon decisions by local authorities.  millionOption1981-82 1982-83 1983-841.

The Lord Chancellor is responsible for capitaland current expenditure on the higher courts inEngland and Wales, for legal aid in all civil casesand in criminal cases in the magistrates&apos; courts; forlegal advice and assistance, and for grants to certainlaw centres. He will take over responsibility forcosts from central funds in criminal proceedingsand legal aid for criminal cases in higher courtsfrom 1 July 1980.2. Current expenditure on civil business is almostentirely offset by court fees; and net expenditure oncurrent account is therefore largely a reflection ofthe number of criminal cases coming forward fortrial in the crown courts. Latest forecasts stillindicate a fairly steady increase of some 3 percenyear in the number of committals in each yearthe survey period. Despite some progress in the pyear in tackling outstanding cases, there remain&apos;substantial backlog, especially in the South Eswhere the length of time that defendants, eithercustody or on bail, have to await trial remainsexcessive levels. (By 1979 the average waiting tiwas 23 weeks in the South East and 30 weeksLondon). For these reasons expenditurecriminal business is likely to rise above the baline figures and accordingly an additional bidbeen submitted. The expenditure forecasts for leaid and advice and assistance also show an increyear by year; those for civil legal aid and advice64

The further reductions required to provide the2 per cent and 3 per cent options would fall oncurrent expenditure in the higher courts, and on thecourt building programme. They would lead to in-creased delays in the hearing of cases in the CrownCourt and growing backlogs throughout the period.Savings in legal aid would require fresh regulations.Any worsening of the conditions governingeligibility for legal aid and liability for contribu-tions would be highly controversial, and wouldreverse the effect of recent changes designedbroadly to restore to former levels the heavilyeroded coverage and benefits of the legal aidscheme.nf,dential65

The Department of Education andScience consider that the reduced requirement for the Research Councils should be omitted since there is no change in therequirement for the planned volume of research announced in Cmnd. 7841 and there has been no collective decision by Ministersthat the squeeze on civil service manpower should be used to effect a permanent reduction in Research Council stafTwho are notcivil servants or a corresponding reduction in the agreed plans for science for later years. The impact of the possible squeezethrough other cash limits in 1980-81 cannot yet be estimated.(&apos;l If options (vi) and (vii) (a), were not taken up, option (vii) (b) would yield some  5 million more (rounded) in each year.[Itroduction         universities in Wales and Scotland and science inThis programme covers mainly education in Great Britain. Over 95 per cent of the total pro-gland but also mandatory awards in Wales,      gramme is expenditure on education which isNFIDENTIAL67
CONFIDENTSplanned to decrease by just over 9 per cent between1978-79 and 1983-84. Over four fifths of the pro-gramme is spending by local authorities, prin-cipally classified as expenditure on goods andservices. Central Government expenditure goesmainly on higher education and to the researchcouncils. It also goes on student awards which is theonly significant part of the programme not subjectto cash limits.2. The main charges in the programme are fortuition fees in higher and further education (whichare however paid from public funds for those whoreceive awards) and for school meals (where thecharge is now fixed by local authorities).Implications of the baseline figures3. The DES consider that, in some importantrespects, the baseline falls short of the minimumlevel of provision consistent with the Government&apos;scommitment in the Queen&apos;s Speech to maintainand improve the quality of education. TheTreasury consider, however, that this commitmentwas fully taken into account by Ministers in reach-ing their decisions on the 1979 survey; their generalview then was that if the resources in the educationprogramme were sensibly allocated, they should besufficient to enable the quality of education to bemaintained at the level of 1978-79.4. The biggest reductions as a result of the 1979survey are planned to be made in areas not directlyrelated to standards of provision for home pupilsand students: hence, there are continuing plannedlarge savings on school meals and milk from1980-81 onwards; and the introduction of full costfees for overseas students starting courses fromSeptember 1980 onwards leads to increasing re-ductions in expenditure on higher and furthereducation up to 1983-84. In addition, there is de-creasing expenditure on schools, as the schoolpopulation falls, after making an allowance for thediseconomies of smaller scale. The DES considerhowever that there is a substantial underprovisionin planned expenditure for schools see paragraphs7 and 8 below.EducationSchools5.

By 1983-84, expenditure is planned to be 5 perlent below the estimated level in 1979-80.

The baseline figures take some account of theeedlo maintain standards of provision and protecthe basic curriculum as pupil numbers fall androblems of redeployment of teachers intensify,he DES consider that the planned number ofeachers falls short of the level required to maintaintandards of provision in 1978-79 by about 7,000eachers in 1981-82, and in 1982-83 and 12,000tachers in 1983-84.

If thispte of closure is achieved, there is allowance foriseconomies of smaller scale as pupil numbers fallnd for additional expenditure on books and equip-lentup to 1982-83 (as recorded in Cmnd 7841).he DES consider that the resources available in583-84 are insufficient by some  50 million tolaintain standards of provision.  The Treasury consider that, as the baseline ex-nditure is planned to fall to only half the extent of19.   Department of Education and Sciencethe fall in the number of pupils, it should bepossible for standards to be maintained.10. The Department of Education and Science areengaged in a joint study with the Treasury on pro-vision for current expenditure on primary andsecondary schools. A first report is expected duringJune for consideration alongside this report.11. Numbers in special schools are projected tofall slightly and provision is planned to remainbroadly level throughout the period. As Ministershave agreed there is no allowance in the baseline forimplementing those recommendations of theWamock Committee involving significantexpenditure.12. The latest provisional assessment of the basicneed for additional places in schools, based on bidsfrom some local authorities received early in 1980,suggests that provision for building starts in1983-84 is too high. However, accurate forecasts ofneed cannot be established at this stage and sinceprovision for starts does not significantly affectexpenditure during the survey period, the baselinehas been left unchanged for further considerationlater in this survey.School meals, milk and transport13. The baseline figures assume that thediscretion available to local authorities under theEducation Act 1980 over provision and charges formeals and milk will lead to savings in 1980-81 ofover half the cost of these services in 1978-79, withslightly higher savings in later years reflectingmainly the falling pupil numbers.14. Cmnd 7841, which assumed savings of  37million in 1981-82 rising to  52 million in 1983-84on school transport, went to press before thegovernment&apos;s decision on 18 March, in the light ofthe vote in the House of Lords not to proceed withlegislation enabling local authorities to charge forschool transport. Ministers agreed that the impli-cations of that decision on expenditure from1981-82 onwards should be considered in the 1980survey. There is therefore a requirement foradditional expenditure on this sub-programme ofthe amounts indicated above.Higher and further education15. The following programmes and provisional69

Total expenditure on higher and furthereducation is planned to fall mainly as a result of re-duced expenditure on overseas students, but alsobecause expenditure for home students in non-university institutions is expected to fall by some 15 million by 1983-84; expenditure for homestudents in universities should remain broadlyconstant. The total numer of home students in bothsectors is expected to remain more or less constant(necessitating a reduction in unit cost especially inthe public sector), but the number of admissionsmay have to fall below the level reached in1979-80. The age participation rate, which hasbeen falling since 1972-73, is assumed to fallfurther, as the 18+age group continues to rise, froman estimated 12-3 per cent in 1979-80 to 11-6 percent in 1983-84. By contrast, DES projectionssuggest that, if rising trends in the proportionqualified school and college leavers desiring toon to higher education, other than teacher traininjwere extrapolated and there were no constraints (expenditure, the age participation rate might harecovered to 13-0 per cent by 1983-84 and tlnumber of home students might have been son50,000 greater than the total of 425,000 shownthe table below.17.

The firstmponent (i) (a) covers deficiencies in the base-e, as identified by the Department of Educationd Science in paragraph 7 of this chapter as beingpessary to maintain standards of provision in.78-79. In the Treasury&apos;s view, the baseline repre-ss the Government&apos;s interpretation of itsmmitment, which was not specifically related to;ndards of provision. The remaining bids aresigned to provide for a more effective use of thething force, (i) (b) provides for the employmentadditional teachers to enable the full-timeWent of 2,000, 3,000 and 4,000 teacherspectively for each of the three years to beeased for in-service training, in addition to theMined level of 5,000 teachers already releasedch year.

The bid wouldlo make possible some additional training forichers in ordinary schools to enable them to assisttpils with special needs as recommended by thearnock Committee. The third component, (i) (c),&apos;bvides for additional payments (at present at theration of local authorities) to about 1,000teachers each year to accelerate the prematureretirement of poor quality teachers. The final com-ponent, (i) (d), provides for the continuation ofschemes for training or re-training teachers forshortage subjects beyond 1982-83 and also for theintroduction in 1981 -82 of a scholarship scheme toattract high quality students to train as teachers inshortage subjects.(ii) Non-teaching costs (schools)23. This bid is considered necessary by theDepartment of Education and Science to maintainstandards of provision for non-teaching costs inschools, as outlined in paragraph 8 of this Chapter.(iii) Mandatory awards24. This bid is designed to ensure that the level ofthese awards is assessed on the same basis as certainshort term social security benefits. It would enableawards to be kept in real value at the 1980-81 level,rather than be cut still further as assumed in thebaseline provision (see paragraph 17 of thischapter).(iv) Science25. This bid would enable opportunities to betaken in areas of fruitful basic research whereBritish scientists excel, where the impetus ofactivity needs to be maintained if we are not to fallbehind our competitors, and which are the essentialpre-requisite for future developments of nationalbenefit. Such areas include biotechnology, a majornew inter-disciplinary field of significant potentialfor industrial innovation; microelectronics, includ-ing advanced computing and fields such as robotics;research in cancer therapy, including the use ofinterferon (a potential anti-cancer drug); andclimatic research using satellites.Unified vocational preparation (UVP)26. The Departments of Education and Scienceand of Employment are currently considering thefuture of pilot projects of unified vocationalpreparation, administered jointly by the EducationDepartments and the Manpower ServicesCommission. There is a growing recognitionamongst employers of the value of this form oftraining for the less skilled occupations, and of theneed to continue and develop the UVP programmeon a wider scale. A number of options have beendrawn up inter-departmentally and it seems likelythat the recommended option will be for a limitediNFIDENTIAL71
19.   Department of Education and ScienceCONFIDENTSexpansion programme which could be met broadlywithin the resources already available (within theprogramme of the Manpower ServicesCommission). If however Ministers decide upon anexpansion beyond this, the Departments wouldneed to submit an additional bid.(v) Overseas students27. It has been agreed that, following Greece&apos;saccession to the EEC, her students should becharged the home student fee from September1981. The DES consider that the sums available tocover the cost of this are inadequate to the extentshown. In the Treasury&apos;s view the resources shouldbe found from within the programme (eg by anincrease in the home student fee).Options for reductions28. Various charges (e.g for under fives and16-18s) in the education service were consideredand ruled out during the 1979 survey. Thereductions already planned limit the further scopefor improvements in efficiency. Any furthersignificant reductions in expenditure would there-fore be likely to entail reductions in the scale orrange of education provided. This would mean alowering of standards or a restriction of oppor-tunities. It could lead to political conflict, and thereare no means of ensuring that local educationauthorities generally would implement plans of thiskind. Hence the precise consequences of theseoptions cannot be forecast: they might well lead toincreases in local rates as well as to cuts in otherservices.(i) Under fives29. This option would mean reducing by about 75per cent the number of pupils under statutoryschool age in primary schools.(ii) School leaving age adjustment30. This option would allow pupils whose 16thbirthday falls between September 1 and January 31to leave at the end of the preceding summer terminstead of the following Spring. This might meanthat up to one-fifth of all pupils would fail to com-plete the present full secondary course. Thelegislation needed would be controversial.(iii) Capital expenditure31. This option would reduce building starts pro-grammes and provision for fees, furniture andequipment by 10 per cent, leading to a reduction icapital expenditure across the board of this order. Iwould mean inadequate provision for basic need,smaller school improvements programme, and qfurniture and equipment in schools, colleges anuniversities.(iv) Administration by local authorities32. This option would jeopardise the Government&apos;s plans for reductions in expenditure througthe provisions in the Education Act 1980 (egoschool meals) and for other reductions (eg througthe closure of surplus schools).(v) Recreational and community projects33. About  20 million of the Department&apos;s pro,gramme goes on local authority spending on villaghalls and other recreational and community pro!jects which are important for adult education anthe Youth Service. This option assumes that moof this expenditure would be abandoned and thYouth Service expenditure would be reduced b10-15 percent(vi) Higher education34. This option would mean a further reductioin the total number of students in higher educatioof about 30,000 by 1983-84 which would involycutting the number of young home entrants tolevel some 10,000 (.10 per cent) below the preselevel, in each of the years after 1980-81, withfurther reduction in the participation rate (see pargraph 16). Taking into account the smaller sizethe non-university sector (160,000 home studen:out of a total of 425,000 expected in 1983-84) anthe reductions already planned in that sector, it hbeen assumed that the effect of this option will faproportionately across the non-university anuniversity sectors, that is reductions of 12,000 a18,000 students by 1983-84 respective!Opportunities for qualified school leavers wouldseverely curtailed, even though there is a shortaof highly qualified manpower in certain fields.(vii) Awards35. The first part of this option is a consequenof (vi). The second allows both for a furthreduction in the value of the award so that1983-84 it would be up to 15 per cent below tlevel assessed necessary to cover living costs and fan increase in parental contributions by some72CONFIDENT!

This option, involving a cut in the Scienceudget of 10 per cent, would mean not only for-king new opportunities such as described in para-graph 25 of this chapter but also abandoning somepolished areas of basic research where Britishientists now make a leading contribution to thevancement of knowledge and to discoverieshich will increase the nation&apos;s prosperity andell-being. It would mean either withdrawing fromhe or more major international facilities in fieldsich as nuclear research, space science and neutronearn research, which effectively sustain theuntry&apos;s capability in these areas; or making cutssupport for university research and scientificstgraduate training and in the activity ofpsearch Councils&apos; own establishments (some of19.

This option reflects the view of someMinisters at the end of the 1979 survey that thereremained scope for further reductions in educationexpenditure. It is, of course, subject to the outcomeof the joint study referred to in paragraph 10 of thischapter, like certain of the additional bids. Theoption implies a 2\ per cent teaching and non-teaching manpower reduction to be achievedthrough improved efficiency and without detrimentto the service. This illustrative percentage isselected by analogy with the reduction imposed inthe civil service but it could be any other figurewith a proportionate effect on the savings.

21.   D HSS Health and Personal Social ServicesCONFIDENT^!Introduction1. About 85 per cent of the programme consists ofexpenditure on the National Health Service, ofwhich almost 70 per cent is cash limited (spendingon the hospital, community health and centrallyfinanced services). Expenditure on the family prac-titioner services (FPS) is demand-determined and isnot cash-limited. Less than S per cent of spendingby the NHS is directly controlled by central govern-ment; the rest is expenditure by health authoritiesand family practitioner committees. About 8 percent of health authority spending is on capital,which has declined in recent years to about four-fifths of its 1975-76 level: revenue expenditure hasincreased at an average of 2 per cent a year between1975-76 and 1978-79 then fell in 1979-80 becauseof the cash limits squeeze.2. The remainder of the programme consists ofexpenditure on the personal social services, almostall of which is by local authorities and is onlyfinanced by central government to the extentimplied in the Rate Support Grant. The servicesprovided complement health services in manyinstances, and spending has increased since themid-1970s in line with demographic change. How-ever, Cmnd 7841 illustrated a reduction in currentexpenditure in 1980-81 to some 6 per cent belowthe level of 1978-79 to enable local authorities tomeet their targets for overall spending reductions.Local authorities were also asked to reduce spend-ing in 1979-80 below plan, but it seems likely thatout-turn will be close to that originally planned.Implications of the survey baseline3. For the years 1980-81 to 1983-84 provision isvirtually as in Cmnd.7841 and implies the follow-ing percentage growths:4. The implications are set out below:(a) Gross health expenditure up to 1982-83 is Jplanned by the previous Administratiol(manifesto commitment) though with nflexpenditure offset by expected income froiincreased FPS charges and estimated inconJfrom increased recovery of treatment costsroad accident victims and from oversejvisitors. This estimated income is dependeon legislative changes not yet agreed.(b) Expenditure on the FPS takes account of  lmillion saving in the drugs bill achieved f1979-80 through a &quot;better prescribing carpaign&quot;, forecast growth in demand and tdeterrent effect of higher charges. Howevjbecause of revised economic assumptions tincome from the  1 prescription charge tointroduced in December 1980 will providejlower proportion of gross expenditure tbexpected (see paragraph 5): from 1982-831charge will be increased in line with inflatio(c) There is no provision in 1983-84 forgrowthlexpenditure on hospital and communhealth services or on centrally financservices. Some allowance over and above tjgrowth of 0-8 per cent in gross current expditure needed to take account of demograpchange is required if the spread of impromedical techniques is not to erode tdemographic provision.(d) The 2 per cent a year growth in expenditon the local authority personal social servifrom 1980-81 will maintain standards (gidemographic change and numbers of childin care) at the lower levels resulting fromplanned cuts in that year.Revised economic assumptions5.

DHSS Health and Personal Social Servicesvised economic assumptions affectingrescription charges.educed requirements not included in the baseline, For the present, the cash limit squeeze on head-uarters expenditure has been allocated wholly toe social security programme. As regards theealth Service the Government already has alicy of switching NHS resources from adminis-tion to direct patient care, and this has beenjowed for in off-setting savings (paragraph 10).dditional bids and offsetting savingsealthBecause of modifications requested by otherterested Departments income obtained by charg-g foreign visitors for NHS treatment formerlyovided free under the &apos;Good Samaritan* policyill yield at least  15 million less than previouslytimated. This figure will need to be reviewed ine light of practical experience.H Committee have decided to defer a decisionthe Health Departments&apos; proposal for greaterovery of the treatment costs of road accidentptims pending the outcome of a study into aoader charging scheme for the recovery ofspital costs in other cases of accidental injury. Items unlikely that the necessary legislation can betraduced in time to raise the whole of the  66illion envisaged for 1981-82. In addition pro-sals to charge for sight tests have been with-wn; ways of replacing this income are beingught but there could still be a deficit of  5 to  10illion a year from 1981 -82.Present expenditure plans provide broadly for 2rcent annual growth in overall gross expenditurehealth up to 1982-83. To continue this inS3-84 would require an extra  109 million whichuld allow a 1-8 per cent increase in healththorities&apos; current expenditure (of which 0*8 perit is required for demographic change).

The staff concernedneed to see that some of the money released isploughed back into the local service. On this basisof sharing, savings of  5 million in 1981-82,  7million in 1982-83 and  15 million in 1983-84 areavailable to offset the additional bids.Personal Social Services11 (a) There is a manifesto commitment on Lawand Order requiring the introduction of ResidentialCare Orders. Given the promise to local authoritiesnot to impose additional burdens without financialprovision, there will be an addition needed ofperhaps up to  10 million a year once Ministershave taken a decision on timing.(b) Joint finance: the original intention of jointfinance between health and local authorities wasthat local authorities should eventually take overprojects supported by the scheme. The plannedreduction in LA PSS resources would severelyrestrict local authorities&apos; ability to assume responsi-bility for joint finance-funded projects. Unlessadditional funds are made available through theRSG mechanism there will be a danger thatschemes will collapse (possibly requiring morecostly substitute care within the NHS) or be con-tinued only at increasing cost to health resources.An addition of  8 million in 1982-83 and  12million in 1983-84 would relieve pressure andNFIDENTIAL79

The Government&apos;s commitment to maintainspending on the health service implies that optionsfor reduction must relate to increased income andnot cuts in gross expenditure. Most possibilities formajor savings have already been precluded in thelast survey and in statements by the Prime Ministerand other Ministers though they are listed againbelow. Savings in public expenditure of 2 per centor 3 per cent of the health programme wouldrequire some combination of the following:Saving   million(a) Half price charges for dentalservices for children andexpectant mothers, and forchildren&apos;s glasses* 10(b) Half price charges for pre-scriptions for most groupscurrently exempt (i.e. theelderly, children, expectantand nursing mothers andthose with specified medicalconditions)* 65(c) Hotel charge of  20 per weekwith exemptions! 20(d)  2 charge for GPconsultation, with exemp-tionsf 50Notes  &apos;Rejected in last survey.

Reduced requirements other than the cashlimits squeeze represent the saving from Clause 6 ofthe Social Security No. 2 Bill whereby strikers willbe assumed to receive  12 strike-pay to beaggregated with other resources.

The uprating of invaliditybenefit in November 1980 is being held back by 5percentage points below price protection. A com-mitment has been made that the level of benefit willbe restored, subject only to resources being availa-ble, when the benefit comes into tax (dateuncertain) (by regulations: saves 50 staff). In theTreasury view, since the date at which invaliditybenefit will come into tax is still uncertain nospecific provision can be made in the programme atthis stage.7. Child benefit. Final decisions on child benefitwill be taken in the context of the Budget judge-ment for 1981-82. There is no provision within theprogramme for any uprating of child benefit beyondthe increase to  4.75 announced for November1980 (as the programme stands any future upratingwould be met from the contingency reserve).Increasing that rate each November in line with amovement of prices would increase expenditure onsocial security over the forward years by the follow-ing amounts:1981-821982-83752501983-8. Any improvement in real terms would cdsome  55 million for each lOp by which the benewas raised in real terms.

This programme consists of the net expenditurecharged to the Vote for civil superannuation, etcoffset by accruing superannuation liability con-tributions made by trading funds, etc. CSDMinisters are responsible for Estimates of this Votein Parliament but the Vote is accounted for by thePaymaster General&apos;s Office. It provides for the pay-ment of pensions, lump sums and other super-annuation benefits to or in respect of civilservants and other staffs covered by the Principalcivil service pension scheme. The forecasts of ex-penditure assume no major changes in the existingprovisions of the scheme.Reduced requirements and additional bids2. These are estimating adjustments. They arisefrom(i) revised assumptions about the increase inthe average level of new awards;(ii) reductions in accruing superannuationliability contributions because of re-ductions in manpower in theorganisations concerned.3. In 1981-82 and 1982-83, the lower levels ofreceipts under (ii) more than offset the reductions inexpenditure under (i) and the net programme is in-creased; in 1983-84, the position is reversed.4. No specific provision has been made for textra costs of introducing a Voluntary Early Retirment scheme in 1980-81 or for increased expend!tures on redundancy compensation, which migneed to be incurred if manpower reductioicannot be achieved by natural wastage.Options for reductions5. There are no practical options for reductionsthis programme at present. Most of the expendituis for the continuing payment of pensions alreadypayment; the remainder is for new awards undthe existing provisions of the pensions scherIncreasing pensions by less than prices would resin reductions in cash spending but not in tvolume of expenditure as defined for White Panpurposes (see below). Deferring retirements is nilout by the emphasis on manpower reductions.6. The volume figures shown for this expenditare based on the convention that future increasespensions under the pensions increase legislationeffectively treated as price rather than voluchanges. This convention is being reviewedofficials, but meanwhile the present volume figuwould not be altered if pensions were toincreased during the survey period by someth?less than the increase in prices.84CONFIDENTI
23.   CSD   Civil SuperannuationI In any case, a decision to amend the pensionsincrease arrangements would affect a wide field ofpublic sector employments and this possibility hasbeen deferred for the time being, pending a reviewof the adequacy of the allowance made for the valueof pension benefits in settling public sector pay.

This new form of presen-tion will appear in the next public expenditurehite Paper.As in last year&apos;s survey, most Scottish Officeogrammes will be dealt with under a blockangement whereby the total expenditure onpe programmes will be adjusted in proportion tototal changes finally agreed for comparablelishprogrammes, usinga ratio of 85:10 (90:10 ifcomparable programme covers England andpes). The relevance of the Needs Assessmentdyto final survey decisions is not dealt with ins report. The Scottish programmes excludedto the &quot;block&quot; arrangement are Agriculture,heries, Food and Forestry; Industry, Energy,and Employment (except Tourism which isthe block); Other Public Services, andCommon Services. Comment on Scottish aspects ofthe AFFF programme is included in the mainprogramme text. The IETE, OPS and CSprogrammes are covered in paragraphs 5-8 and10-12 below.Comparability principle3, The Secretary of State will be free to adjust,between the programmes covered by the blockarrangements, the total expenditure finally agreedfor the block. This freedom is subject to consulta-tion as necessary with his Cabinet colleagues.Accordingly he is currently reviewing all theprogrammes and services for which he is responsi-ble and some reallocation of resources may beaffected later. This discretion does not extend to themanpower provision which continues to be subjectto overall control by the Civil Service Department.Agriculture4.

24. ScotlandCONFIDENTIIETE5. The Scottish Office has provision inprogrammes 4.1,4.4 and 4.7. In programme 4.1 theexpenditure provision covers selective assistance toindustry in the assisted areas; the Highlands andIslands Development Board; residual expenditureunder the Local Employment Act; the ScottishDevelopment Agency; Oil Platform Sites andTourism which, as stated above, is within theScottish block of comparable programmes. InProgramme 4-4 provision is made for payments tothe North of Scotland Hydro Electric Board forlosses incurred by the Board in supplying electricityto the British Aluminium Company smelter atInvergordon. Provision is also made in Programme4-7 for local authority expenditure on the CareersService in Scotland.Additional bids6. For these three programmes the proposedadditional bids are:  million		1981-82	1982-83	1983-84Subprogramme	4.1.3	.f 12-3	11-2	4-7	4.1.7.	0-3	0-2	0-5	4.1.14	01	01	01Programme	4.4 .	08	-2-7	1-8	4.7 .	 	01	017.  These bids arise as follows: a. On subprogramme 4.1.3 from revised forecastsof demand for regional selective assistance, andrepresent the additional expenditure needed tomaintain existing policies.b. On subprogramme 4.1.7, because a  1 millionLocal Employment Act loan was repaid earlygiving a shortfall of receipts in subsequent years.c. On subprogramme 4.1.14 in respect of main-tenance contracts at the offshore site at Portavadie.Responsibility for the maintenance contract is atpresent under discussion between the ScottishDevelopment Department and the Department ofEnergy, but a contingency bid is necessary.d. On programme 4.4 for 1981-82 and 1983-84and the reduced requirement identified for1982-83, because of revised estimates by the Northof Scotland Hydroelectric Board of the smelterdeficit payments. These bids assumed, that thedispute between the Hydro Board and the BritishAluminium Company over certain charges is notsettled during the period or is resolved in tBoard&apos;s favour. If the Board were to lose tdispute, they would look to the Governmentreimburse the accumulated disputed charges. Tlcould mean additional expenditure of around  million probably falling in 1983-84.e. On programme 4.7 because of increased staffi!requirements in the Careers Service.Option reductions8.

No additional bids, offsetting savings or optreductions will be submitted for the block becajof the formula approach described in paragrapThe additional bids and options for reductishown in the table above are derived fromstraight-forward application of the formulacomparable expenditure. The final figuresdepend on the size of the actual changes agreecomparable expenditure at the conclusion ofyear&apos;s survey. There is a bid for increased expeture on staff costs for the Scottish Prison Sewhich amounts to  1-2 million in 1981-821982-83 and  11 million in 1983-84. Staff costssubject to control by the CSD and any additioagreed, will be found from within theprovision for the block adjusted as appropriatthe formula.Other public services10.

There is also a bid, about which CSD haveen consulted, of  0-2 million in 1982-83 and  0-4illion in 1983-84 for additional staff required as aresult of the implementation of the Land Registra-tion (Scotland) Act, 1979. No savings can be offeredto offset these increases.12. The option reduction on this programmewould amount to  1-0 million in 1981-82 and  1-4million in 1982-83 and 1983-84. Much of theexpenditure on this programme is on staff and theonly place where savings of this order could befound would be local authority current expendi-ture.Common services13. This programme comprises expenditure bythe Scottish Information Office on the productionand dissemination of public service information onbehalf of the Departments of the Secretary of Statefor Scotland and, in smaller measure, for UKDepartments operating in Scotland. There are noadditional bids and the option reductions of 2 percent and 3 per cent are too small to register in PES.

Under this principle, the alloca-tion will be varied, mainly by means of a formulateed on relative populations, to reflect any netadjustment, whether upwards or downwards, whichnay be made in the total allocation for comparablefeat Britain programmes. (The relevance of theiftds assessment study to final survey decisions islot dealt with in this report). It has also been agreed{tat, as in previous years, the Secretary of State forNorthern Ireland should have freedom to utilize ashe thinks best the resources allocated to him.Accordingly he is currently reviewing all the pro-grammes and services for which he is responsibleand some reallocation of resources may be effectedlater.Additional bids and savings options3. No additional bids, offsetting savings or optionsfor reductions are being submitted in the context ofthis survey because of the formula approachdescribed in paragraph 2. The additional bids andoptions for reductions shown in the above table arederived from the straightforward application of theformula. However the final figures depend on thesize and incidence of the actual changes agreed inGreat Britain.4. There are strong indications that NorthernIreland will face major resource problems over thesurvey period. These will be particularly acute inrespect of energy (because of Northern Ireland&apos;sCONFIDENTIAL93

Meanwhile in view of fflrange of uncertainties and the possibilityadditional bids for some or all years in the perio1981/82 to 1983/84, it would be imprudent atthstage to take credit for the shortfall allowancesome  470 million which was included in the basline figures.

Cabinet OfficeProgress is being made towards the reductions towhich the Cabinet Office is already committedunder the Lord President&apos;s Review. If the Depart-ment has to make additional reductions inexpenditure in 1981 -82 and later years these wouldentail further curtailment of the services providedby the Cabinet Secretariat, Central Policy ReviewStaff and the Central Statistical Office.2. Central Office of Information (COI).The COI is not making any additional bids butadditional bids for publicity campaigns have beenincluded in the programmes for the Ministry ofDefence and the Departments of Transport andEnergy. If these are agreed then the expenditure willbe incurred through COI.The reductions shown would entail a correspond-ing proportionate reduction in the expenditure onthe publicity campaigns of all government depart-ments.3. Charity CommissionThe additional bid of  01 million in 1981-82covers computer expenditure. This is due to slip-page in the programme for supplying the CharityCommission with a computer. It had originallybeen intended to supply the computer in 1980-81and PES cover had been provided for that year, butthis has had to be withdrawn.The options for reductions would require theCharity Commission to reduce its functions and cutback on its services. This would inevitably put it ijbreach of its statutory obligations and would therfore require legislation.4. Civil Service DepartmentThe reduced requirements arise on computers antelecommunication following the move to a repa;ment basis. These reductions have been used in pajto fund a deficit on the programme for civil servicatering services for the years 1980-81 to 1982-61but an additional bid is still required for 1983-ijbecause of the anticipated transfer of committerun restaurants to CISCO management.The most feasible reductions would be (1) furthabandonment of activities of the Civil ServiCollege and (2) cuts in computer and telcommunications fee paid services and developmeistudies. Coming on top of other current steconomies, such reductions would further limit teffectiveness of civil service training and wouprejudice the ability of the Central Computer aTelecommunications Agency to obtain value flmoney in computer and telecommunicatioiexpenditure.5. Commonwealth War Graves CommissionThe UK makes a fixed percentage contributionthe Commission&apos;s expenditure. The cost of the U|contribution can therefore only be cut if to&apos;expenditure is reduced with the approval of all t;participating Governments. The options freductions would entail further staff savings whic98
CONFIDENTIAL28.  Smaller Departmentsfollowing the large savings already made, wouldseriously affect the Commission&apos;s ability to main-lain the Commonwealth war cemeteries, graves,and memorials as required by the participatingGovernments and would entail disproportionatelyhigher costs in future years because of inadequateconservation.i Customs and ExciseThe options for reductions consist of abolition oflietting and gaming duties except on pool bettingand jackpot machines: temporary laying up of partof the cutter fleet: reduction of manpower resourcesdevoted to the collection of trade statistics and tothe control of imports: restructuring of excisecontrol on spirits, wine and beer and thecompulsory deregistration of VAT traders belowthe statutory registration threshold. The options,which include contingency options in the LordPresident&apos;s exercise, would involve considerablerevenue loss, increased risk of smuggling, a seriousdeterioration in the quality and availability ofstatistics and adverse effects on traders.I Exchequer and Audit DepartmentAs the functions of the Controller and AuditorGeneral are independent of Ministers, no staffreductions have been required of the E &amp; AD forthe 1980-81 cash limit squeeze. To strengthen auditmethods and management   in accordance withthe recommendation of the 1978 ManagementReview   it is foreseen at present that there will becontinuing commitment over the forecast periodfor increases in staff but the position will be keptunder review in the light of developments in auditmethods and the effects of any contraction in publicxpenditure on audit requirements. Reductions inspenditure of 2% and 3% could only be made byducing the scope and quality of the audit.Registry of Friendly Societieshe options for reductions would entail someduction in staff with a consequent effect on theWei of service.  Government Actuary&apos;s Departmenthedepartment is not responsible for any expendi-ue other than on staff and general administrative&apos;penses. A 2% reduction would mean 1 actuaryewer; 3% would mean the loss of a further actuary,he reductions would mean that some actuarialrvices to Government departments and otherorganisations would have to be withheld or severelyrestricted.10. House of CommonsThe additional bid is for an increased grant in aid tothe Members Fund to implement the TSRB recom-mendation that grants be paid as of right to pre-1964 MPs who are entitled to no Parliamentarypension. It is contingent upon legislation in the1980-81 session. Options for reductions in mostareas have not been provided. However, PSAexpenditure on the Palace of Westminster has beenincluded in the baseline and commensurate optionsfor reductions are shown. The baseline figures after1980-81 allow for expenditure of about  3-5million a year on rent, maintenance and fuel, lessthan the current level of expenditure, with a smallprovision for new works, furniture and equipment.Any cut would have to fall on the latter and wouldmake it difficult to meet essential requirements.The provisions beyond 1980-81 do not allow forfurther modernisation of the heating and ventilat-ing system, for the Broad Sanctuary telephoneexchange, or for smaller but important servicessuch as security screens, fire precautions and newboilers.11. House of LordsThere are no additional bids and no options forreductions have been provided.12. Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery OfficeAn additional bid of  0-5 million a year has beenmade in respect of a subsidy for Parliamentary pub-lications other than Hansard as it will not bepossible to carry the cost of these publications with-out an unacceptable price increase.The options for reductions would mean increases inthe prices of Hansard, a reduction in the discountoffered to Public Libraries, a loss to the trading fundand the deferment of investment in new plant andmachinery.13. Inland RevenueThe additional bids on tax and rate collection,which are supported by CSD, are necessitated bythe purchase or hire of equipment for setting up anational computerised PA YE system which willeventually produce significant manpower savings.The system would entail similar expenditure inlater years of the following order:  23 million in1984-85,  42 million in 1985-86 and  9 million in1986-87. In addition, there would be associatedONFIDENTIAL99
28.  Smaller Departmentsconfidentsaccommodations costs on the PSA Vote. Includedin the figure for 1981 -82 is an additional bid of  0-1million in respect of capital moneys needed for atax office building at Catford which PSA are unableto provide. In response to a ministerial initiativeInland Revenue have agreed to provide this fromoffsetting savings elsewhere. The additional bids onpost-war credits arise because the residual claims torepayment are continuing at a higher rate thananticipated. The expenditure is demand-determined and not subject to cash limits. There isno Vote. The additional bids are not supported byCSD who would propose to defer considerationuntil the 1981 survey when the situation will beclearer.Options for reductions would stem from staffreductions largely as a result of legislative or fiscalchanges. Changes in tax thresholds greater thanthose required under existing taxation provisionswould save staff though at the cost of considerableloss of revenue. Apart from this, specific optionsinclude the extension of the PA YE machinery toreplace existing arrangements for taxing fringebenefits and holiday pay, the abolition of tax reliefon overseas earnings, and the termination of thearrangements for averaging farming profits for tax.14. National Investment and Loans Office(NILO)The NILO generates sufficient receipts to cover itsoperational costs. As regards NILO&apos;s gross spendingthe merger of the National Debt Office and thePublic Works Loan Board on 1 April 1980 isplanned to produce a saving of 22% on staff costs by31 March 1982. For further reductions, a 2% saving( 0-010 million) would flow from the cessation ofthe Irish Land Purchase Vote, which would requirelegislation: additional savings, amounting to 3%overall ( 0-015 million) would flow from ceasing toprovide the Central Statistical Office with financialstatistics on Trustee Savings Bonds. CSO howeverregard these figures as essential both for internal useand for their publications. In the case of NILOoptions for reductions would increase net revenuerather than reduce expenditure and therefore nilopti on s are shown.15. H.1VL Land RegistryThe options for reductions would fall on the capitalbuilding programme for new offices. This wouldaffect the efficiency of the Land Registry&apos;s futureoperations.16. National Savings DepartmentThe option offered is for the nineteenth issue osavings certificates to be withdrawn from salshortly after 31 March 1981. DNS state that this i1the most feasible option they can identify. The fulyear saving from discontinuing this issue is  1&apos;million approximately. Withdrawal of the issujsoon after the beginning of the financial yea1981- 82 would be involved (despite the requirereduction for that year being only  1 million) iorder to allow for an orderly run down of staff anto cope with any additional work arising fropublic reaction to the withdrawal. This option ijcosted to save  1-5 million: by contrast the nineteenth issue has brought in  471-5 million betwee.its launching on 4 February 1980 and 9 May 198The option also involves not being able to makefuture issue of saving certificates without replacinlthe staff envisaged as being dispensed with undthis option. The retirement issue would not baffected.The additional bid in the years 1981-82 an1982- 83 represents the salary costs of staredeployed with CSD approval from the NationSavings Bank (a self-funding organisation outsithe survey) to Treasury-funded savings servicadministered by DNS. CSD support the additionbid.17. Northern Ireland court serviceThe reduced requirement of  0-3 million1982-83 is due to slippage in the court building prgramme. The additional bid of  0-3 million1981-82 is for the acquisition of a site for a nejcourt building. The effect of the options fireductions Would cause a serious disruption of woin the numerous small working units throughojthe service, and a steady buildup of a backlogcases. It would also mean a decline in the maitenance of buildings.18. Ordnance SurveyThe additional bid of  0-6 million in 1983-84 isa replacement computer. The exercise of toptions would mean a reduction in the serviwhich the Ordnance Survey Department could pvide.19.

It is dependent on public demand.20. Paymaster General&apos;s Officepere are additional bids of  1-6 million in51-82,  0-5 million in 1982-83 and  0-7 million1983-84. The work of the department isessentially demand-led and the growth in pensionbanking work necessitates extra funds for[computers and support services. Potential savingsmillion a year are identified. These would beby ceasing to pay pensions weekly,gress on this option is linked with CSD&apos;s&apos;proposal to cease payment of wages weekly and to alesser extent to the consideration being given by! to the possibility of ending weekly paymentbfsocial security benefits.1. Privy Council Officele 2|% reduction for this department will not beachieved by a manpower reduction but by a savingn their general administrative expenses.he options for reductions would entail cuts inanpower which would affect efficiency.Public Record Officehe additional bid of  0-6 million for 1981-82 isomprised of  0-5 million in respect of outstandingonimitments involving contractual and extra-Mtractual expenditure for the construction ofRecord Office&apos;s building at Kew, and  0-1n in respect of a new lift to be installed at thepartment&apos;s Chancery Lane building. In thereasury view the latter item could be postponed orregone altogether. The options for reductionsfall on the services offered by the PublicOffice to the public. They would involveMacks in staff, equipment and facilities.3&lt; Public Trustee Officehe reduction in 1980-81 and consequentialditional bid in 1981-82 reflect a slippage in convMer expenditure. Reductions of  0-05 million a-arover the survey period are the result of staffvings but any further reductions would notWuce a net financial saving since income wouldhcommensurately.24. Queen&apos;s &amp; Lord Treasurer&apos;s RemembrancerThe additional bids are to meet forecast growth inthe number of Crown Prosecutions over the years1981-84.The options for reductions are fixed penalties forcertain road traffic offences and the introduction ofadministrative fines. Both would entail legislationoutside the control of QLTR.25. Office of Fair TradingThe option for a 2% ( 70,000) reduction in the1981- 82 programme would involve closing OFT&apos;sEdinburgh Office and would undoubtedly bringforth strong protests from Scottish consumerinterests. Four posts in London would have to begiven up as well.The option for a 3% ( 105,000) reduction in the1982- 83 programme and later years would involvegiving up another post and savings would have to bemade in overseas travel and on miscellaneouspublicity. The OFT would no longer be able torepresent the United Kingdom at certain inter-national meetings or carry out properly certain ofthe statutory functions it is expected to perform.26. Office of Population Censuses and SurveysReductions of 2% in 1981 -82 and 3% in each of thelater years would yield savings of  0-8 million,  0-5million and  0-4 million respectively. They wouldthreaten the ability to carry out the 1981 Censusand seriously reduce other services.The additional bid, which CSD supports, includes 01 million in years 1982-83 and 1983-84 forcomputer staff, and a timing change of  01 from1981 -82 to 1982-83 for Ordance Survey services.27. Treasury (administration, note issue etc.)Around 80% of this expenditure is in respect ofpayments to the Bank of England for servicescarried out on behalf of the Government and to theRoyal Mint for the production of UK coinage. TheBank are examining the scope for reducing the costof their services but it is too early to say whatsavings may result. The additional bid representscapital expenditure by the Bank in relocating theRegistrar&apos;s department which should ultimatelyreduce the costs of debt management. The costs ofproducing coins for circulation in the UK are morethan covered by receipts representing the face valueNFIDENTIAL101
28.  Smaller DepartmentsCONFIDENT^of the coins which are paid direct into the Consoli-dated Fund. Expenditure on running the Treasuryand its sub-departments is all staff-related; fullaccount has been taken of all the exercises to reducestaff costs. Any significant reductions in the base-line figures could only be attained by reducing theTreasury&apos;s capacity to respond speedily withaccurate advice on the financial and economicissues which come before Government28. Treasury (Rating of Government PropertyDepartment)Administrative expenditure is included in pro-gramme 13. This programme provides for the ratecontributions on Crown premises occupied byExchequer Departments and for the Government&apos;sobligations under various treaties etc in respect ofrates on premises occupied by international organi-sations and foreign and Commonwealth govern-ments for diplomatic and military purposes. Thereare no options for reductions within theadministrative responsibility of RGPD butreductions in other programmes which resulted inthe vacation and disposal of property held by theCrown would generate consequential savings in thisprogramme.29. Treasury Solicitor&apos;s DepartmentA reduction in 1981 -82 is on criminal costs and feesby the DPP and the additional bid of  0-1 million inthe same year is to meet the outstanding costs of theCrown Agents Enquiry which is likely to finishtowards the end of 1980-81. Further reductions of 01 million in 1981-82 and 1983-84 are in respectof lower staff costs.The expenditure by the Treasury Solicitor isdemand determined and it would not be possible tomake the option reductions without either legis-lation or the reduction of services rendered to clientdepartments.Detail of reduced requirements  million at 1980 survey prices milli&apos;80-8!81-82    82-83 83-81	80-81	81-82	82-83	83-84Cabinet Office,	01	0-1	0-1	0-1COI.     . w	. 0*2	0-2	0-2	0-2Charity Commission	0-1	0-1	01	01Civil Service Dept.

Annex HCONFIDENTSANNEX HThe relative price effectThe main figures in this survey report are atconstant prices in volume terms. This presentationhas considerable advantages because it enablesdiscussion to focus on the content of the pro-grammes, leaving aside the uncertainties aboutfuture rates of inflation.2. In reality the wages and prices paid in thepublic services may increase at a faster or slowerrate than prices in the economy generally and so thevolume figures may not give a full measure of therelative cost of the expenditure plans. It is the costof the plans, taking account of this &quot;relative priceeffect&quot; (RPE), that matters in assessing the impli-cations of the plans for taxation, the borrowingrequirement and the money supply.3. The figures shown in table H2 illustrate the costof the survey baseline expressed elsewhere in thisreport in volume terms. They incorporate Depart-ments&apos; own estimates of the way in which prices ofdifferent types of expenditure have moved in thepast and assumptions about how they may move inthe future based on the Medium Term FinancialStrategy (MTFS). The basis of the figures isexplained in detail below.4. The figures &quot;in cost terms&quot; differ from cashestimates only by the extent of general inflation, asmeasured by the GDP market price deflator. Thecorresponding volume figures differ from cash esti-mates both by the extent of general inflation and bythe relative price movements specific to individualitems of expenditure. The difference between thefigures - the relative price effect - reflects the dif-ference between pay and price increases in thepublic services and price increases in the economygenerally. Table HI shows how the cost termsfigures relate to the volume figures and how themain economic categories contribute to the aggre-gate estimate of the RPE.5. The table shows that, compared with 1979-80,about  1 billion has been added to the cost of theexpenditure plans as a result of various Cleggawards, the staged settlements for civil servants andlocal authority white collar workers, and tpresent round of pay settlements. The RPE on pis offset by other economic categories where, filargely technical reasons explained below, pric&apos;have recently tended to increase by less than tGDP deflator. However this does not detract frothe difficulties caused by this last year&apos;s pay settlments and their enormous impact on the costproviding public services.The basis of the figures6. The figures for past years in table H2 ajderived by inflating actual expenditure from oturn prices to average 1979-80 prices, using tGDP deflator. The figures for 1980-81 and la]years are derived by first converting figures from 19:survey prices to average 1979-80 prices, using tjrelationships reported by Departments between testimated outturn for 1979-80 at outturn pricesaJat 1980 survey prices. The figures are then adjust!for the amounts by which changes in the priceseach item of expenditure are assumed to differ frchanges in the general price level in theahead. Some 30 different indices are used for tpurpose,   distinguishing   between   the meconomic categories and allowing for the differmajor pay groups.7. Interpretation of the relative price effect mtake account of the particular measurement cventions used. For expenditure on wagessalaries, which is roughly one third of total puexpenditure, there has been a tendency in thefor the relative price effect to be positive,reason for this was the difference between pductivity growth in the non-trading public se(which by convention is assumed to be zero)productivity growth in the rest of the econoWhereas the rate of growth of underlying prodjtivity in the whole economy was about 2f% inperiod before 1973, it has recently been arounto 11 per cent. With the reduction in the assudifference between productivity growth inpublic and private sectors one would expe&lt;jreduction in the RPE.124CONFIDENTI
CONFIDENTIALAnnex HI Second, as regards other public expenditure  that is other than on wages and salaries - severalfactors have combined to make its price rise lessthan the GDP deflator in recent years. The risingreal exchange rate has meant that domestic costs which exclude imports and which is what the GDPdeflator measures - rise more than the average pricethat the public sector pays, and also more than theretail prices index which is used to deflate socialsecurity expenditure. In addition, the GDP deflatorhas been increased by the rising share of North Seaoil output in total output. Because most of the oilbased rise in national income takes the form ofprofits, as these profits rise (faster than wages) therewill be a tendency for the GDP deflator to rise fasterthan other domestic prices, which are related towage costs.Public expenditure in cost terms:  analysis of the relative price effectibleHl   million at 1979-80 prices	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80	1980-81	1981-82	1982-83	1983-84ilic expenditure before shortfall and									special sales of assets:									- in volume terms, at 1980 survey									prices......	82,133	79,424	76,228	80,206	82,596	83,209	81,748	80,104	79,795price adjustment . .	-650	-650	-650	-650	-650	-650	-650	-650	-700- in volume terms, at 1979-80 average									prices.....	81,450	78,750	75,600	79,550	81,950	82,550	81,100	79,450	79,100Relative price effect    .

CONFIDENTIALAnnex JANNEX JPublic service manpowerTable Jl summarises the detailed manpowerestimates in table J2 to J5 for the civil service, thehealth service (NHS), the armed forces and localauthorities. Apart from those for the civil service,i projections are broadly consistent with the base-le expenditure estimates. The projections for thecivil service include the effect of the reductionsannounced by the Prime Minister on 14 March and13 May 1980. The figures are expressed as financialyear averages of whole time equivalents except forthe family practitioner services where absolutenumbers are used.2. The figures are not comprehensive: theyexclude those central government workers who arenot civil servants - for example the crown servantsemployed by the Forestry Commission - and most&gt;lic service employees in Northern Ireland. Nordo the figures correspond precisely with the aggre-gate estimates of wages and salaries incorporated inhe baseline expenditure figures, because theynclude staff employed in trading services and onpital projects.Public service manpower as defined in thisnnex accounts for some 20 per cent of totalmployment. It includes family practitioners andenlists who are counted in the private sector in thelatistics of employment published annually by theentral Statistical Office in &quot;National Income andxpenditure&quot; and &quot;Economic Trends&quot;. Employees[the nationalised industries and other public cor-orations are excluded, as are the staff ofdiversities, which are private sector bodies.The broad picture is of public service man-ower declining by 4% between 1979-80 and4. Civil service manpower is projected to be11% below the level in 1979-80 and localMhority manpower some 8% below. Manpower ini the NHS and the armed forces is expected tocrease - by just over 6% in both cases.iil serviceThe figures in table J2 were prepared by thevil Service Department. For the survey years,ey show the projected numbers of industrial andnon-industrial civil servants (including the effect ofthe announced reductions), expressed as financialyear averages. The cost of staff in the four tradingfunds, (Royal Mint, Royal Ordnance Factories,PSA Supplies Division and HMSO) does not countas public expenditure, and is therefore not includedin the survey baseline. However, these staff consti-tute part of the civil service, and their numbers areincluded in the table. Civil service manpower hasfallen in each year since 1976-77 to 1979-80. Atthis stage, the figures are speculative: it is assumedfor illustrative purposes that there will be a steadyrun down of 20,000 a year over the next four years,as the Governments plans to reduce the size of theCivil Service to 630,000 over this period areimplemented.National Health Service6. The figures in table J3 were prepared by theDepartment of Health and Social Security, theWelsh Office and the Scottish Home and HealthDepartment. The projections are based on staffingstatistics as at 30 September which reasonablyreflect the financial year average. In line with theconventions used in &quot;Health and Personal SocialServices Statistics&quot;, the figures for staff in hospitals,community health services and other healthservices are in whole-time equivalent terms,whereas the figures for the family practitionerservice are the numbers of general medicalpractitioners and dentists in the national healthservice, whether whole-time or part-time workers.7. The projections for the survey period areestimates based on the assumption that the propor-tion of expenditure on remuneration will remainbroadly constant and that the effect of the manage-ment costs exercise in England will be a switchbetween staff groups rather than an overallreduction in staff numbers. In addition, forhospitals and community health services inEngland, the growth in whole-time equivalents overthe period is expected to be less than the growth inwages and salaries, reflecting among other factors arelatively higher increase in more expensive staffgroups.NFIDENTIAL127
AnnexJCONFIDENTS8. The figures for England and Wales exclude civilservants whose pay is allocated to the health pro-gramme including those working at, for example,special hospitals (these civil servants are includedin table J2). The figures for &quot;other health services&quot;in Scotland include the common services agencies(which provide the ambulance, blood transfusionand some other services) and also staff at the statehospital.Armed forces9. Table J4 gives figures for personnel in eachbranch of the Services. The figures for 1979-80 on-wards are derived from the 1980 long-term costingforecast of tri-services manpower. They do notcorrespond exactly with the baseline expendituretotals but suggest an initial fall in 1979-80 afterwhich they rise slowly. Figures for &quot;locally engagedpersonnel&quot; represent men recruited outside theUnited Kingdom for full-time service, includingGurkhas. The &quot;paid reserves&quot;, comprise the part-time members of the Paid Reserve Forces, theUlster Defence Regiment, and personnel of thereserves serving in a full-time capacity. Neither the&quot;locally engaged personnel&quot; nor the &quot;paidreserves&quot; are included in the public service totals intable Jl.10. Figures for the civilian defence staff, exclud-ing locally engaged staff, are included in the table ofcivil service manpower, J2.Local authorities11. The manpower figures in table J5 are inwhole-time equivalent terms and take account ofpart-time employees who make up about one-thirdof the total local authority employment in GreatBritain, now about three million. The figures showninclude employees in local authorities&apos; tradingservices, eg housing and passenger transport, as wellas those in rate fund services and engaged on capitalprojects. The estimates for individual services arebased on departments&apos; returns. The figures forRoads and Transport include some constructioworkers - about 13 thousand (WTE) - who aremployed on work for other services. In the case oeducation those teachers who also work as Flecturers are scored only once in table J5.12. The figures show local authority manpowejfalling by some 2 per cent from 1977-80 to 1983-8after the peak of 2,356 thousand in 1979-80. More]over these estimates necessarily have a wide rangof error attached to them, especially for lateyears, because of the difficulty of forecasting thannual rate of wage drift, and matching to the PESprogrammes the figures in the joint manpowewatch. The decrease occurs in all services exceplaw, order and protective services although thjnumbers employed in personal social services pickup towards the end of the period. The figures arbased on actuals up to December 1979 and therea.ter relate to the baseline expenditure figures in thsurvey report, and therefore from 1980-81 onwarcassume compliance by the local authorities with thexpenditure plans. In practice, local authoritibudgets for 1980-81 indicate that the expendingplans are unlikely to be achieved before 1981-82the earliest.13. Local authority staffing in England and Walhas been monitored since the middle of 1975 by tGovernment and local authority associatiothrough the joint manpower watch group reportito the Consultative Council on Local GovernmeFinance. A similar watch on staff numbers in Scoland was instituted in consultation with the Covention of Scottish Local Authorities in Marc1976.These manpower watch figures, averaged over eacfinancial year, have been used as the base for tprojections in the table with the exception of so13,000 whole-time equivalent part-time firemand some 2,700 staff of inner-London polytechniwho are excluded from the manpower watch.128CONFIDENT!

Annex KCONFIDENTIALANNEX KLocal authority current andcapital expenditureTable Kl brings together the component of thesurvey plans which is local authority currentexpenditure in Great Britain. It shows the adjust-ment which is necessary to convert expenditurecovered by the survey to that relevant for ratesupport grant (RSG) purposes. Aggregate Exche-quer Grant (which includes specific and supple-mentary grants and the residual as Rate SupportGrant) is paid at a specified proportion of this sum -for 1980-81,61 per cent in England and Wales and6i{ per cent in Scotland. Relevant expenditure alsoincludes allowances for revenue contributions tocapital spending, revenue contributions to rate fundexpenditure and loan charges net of interest receiptson balances.2. With the exception of 1977-78, when there wasa 0.9 per cent decline, local authorities&apos; currentexpenditure grew slowly during the past periodcovered by table Kl. When the present governmentassumed office last year, local authorities inEngland and Wales were asked to reduce theircurrent expenditure in 1979-80 by 3 per centcompared to the previous government&apos;s plans, orabout 2 per cent compared to 1978-79. However,provisional figures suggest that outturn localauthority current expenditure in England andWales in 1979-80 will be very close to the planspublished in Cmnd. 7439.3. Local authorities&apos; budgets for 1980-81 havebeen struck at a level 5-6 per cent higher than thesurvey in England and Wales, 4-5 per cent higher inScotland. Ministers have asked local authorities torevise their budgets downwards, and have drawnattention to the need for manpower reductions ifthe survey plans are to be achieved.4. The plans require continuing reduction in localauthorities&apos; current expenditure in future years: 4-1per cent in 1980-81 (compared to provisionaloutturn in 1979-80), 19 per cent in 1981-82(compared to plan), 1 -9 per cent in 1982-83 and 2-8percent 1983-84. (The paths are similar in Englaand Wales and in Scotland). They reflect decisiotaken at programme level, including reductionteacher numbers in response to demographtrends, maintenance of standards in the soci-services at a somewhat lower level than impliedthe inherited plans, priority for law and order acorresponding reductions in most other services,the case of housing the path reflects an illustratisplit of the integral line). It is hoped that tintroduction of block grant in England and Walea new and fairer means of distributing RSG - fro1981-82 will provide an incentive to local authoties to keep their expenditure within reasonabjlimits. The same objective is being pursueddifferent means in Scotland.5. Table K2 shows the capital expenditurelocal authorities in Great Britain, analysedprogramme. At present a distinction is madeEngland and Wales between key sector projewhich are subject to specific departmental appval, and the locally determined sector, within whijlocal authorities are free to set their own prioritiFrom 1981-82 control in England and Wales w|as in Scotland, bite directly on expenditure ajlocal authorities will be free to adjust their spendipatterns to suit their own priorities, subject to ma,fewer central government constraints.6. Capital  expenditure  has declined shanfthroughout the survey period at an average ratel13} per cent a year up to 1979-80. The plaHprovide for a continued fall at an average rate ofper cent a year although it should be noted thatfigures for housing are only illustrative sincedecision on allocations of the total between currand capital has yet been made. This is a signinccut compared to the inherited plans, whrequired stability throughout the forecast periodis partly a reflection of a more realistic approa.given the tendency to heavy capital underspendparticularly on housing by local authorities.

CONFIDENTIALAnnex LANNEX LPublic expenditure on constructionPublic expenditure on construction accounts forhalf of the construction industry&apos;s output.However, the proportion varies between differentsectors of the industry and is about 90% in the caseif civil engineering. The level and composition ofpublic expenditure is therefore of particularconcern to the industry. The industry is alsoimportant to the public sector since most of publicsector fixed investment and over half of total publiccapital expenditure is on construction work. Theconstruction industry contributes 20 per cent to thepidex of industrial production.Recent developments and prospects1. Table 1 shows construction output since1975-76. After reaching a peak in 1972-73 outputfell sharply up to 1976-77. Since then it has showni moderate recovery as a result of a fairly rapidjowth in private sector work more than offsetting asmall reduction in output for the public sector. Theprospect for 1980-81 is for a very sharp drop inoutput. The expected recession is likely to produce&apos;moderate fall in private sector work as investmentttpenditure is cut back. A much larger fall isBpected in public sector work as a result of, injarticular, the large cut-back in new house-building. Beyond 1980-81 a further fall in publicsector work is expected on transport, water etc.Mess the construction share of the housing pro-prame rises there will be a further reduction inhand from that source. On the assumption that^economy resumes modest growth, there may be&quot;me offsetting increase in the private sector.&apos; Table 2 gives a broad functional analysis of theinstruction content of the baseline plans, whichUpdates the construction table (5.2) in Cmnd. 7841.&apos;differs from the public sector component of table&apos;inthat it relates to the construction component oftyital expenditure and does not include repair and&quot;lintenance work: for many programmes expendi-&quot;&quot;e in the latter category cannot be identified. Thew of expenditure shown by the figures therefore&quot;responds more to the new work component ofNc sector construction output than to the total&apos;&quot;&apos;he public sector (though the price basis of table1 relates to the national accounts, whereas that oftable 2 relates to the survey). Both tables show asimilar picture of a progressive decline in the publicsector&apos;s demand on the construction industry inrecent years. Table 1 suggests a sharper decline in1980-81 than does table 2: this reflects the fact thattable 1 takes account of prospective shortfall in1980-81, whereas table 2 does not, since the patternof shortfall has not yet emerged for that year. Sinceno decisions have been made on the allocation ofthe housing programme beyond 1980-81, table 2contains no figures for housing expenditure (ortherefore for the totals) for the subsequent years.4. Table 3 shows the new construction content ofadditional bids and options for reductions where itis a significant (i.e. in excess of  5 million in anyone year) element in those bids or options, for thoseDepartments whose total bids and options implysignificant (i.e. in excess of  15 million in any oneyear) changes in construction expenditure. Theconstruction elements listed in Table 3 amount tosome 5 per cent of the totals for both bids andoptions. (New construction represents nearly 8 percent of total expenditure on programmes, but the 5per cent figure of course includes only major items).5. The options for reductions on the housing pro-gramme have not been allocated between thedifferent components of the programme, and noconstruction content of those options is shown intable 7. If the Treasury&apos;s suggested allocation of thehousing options were made, they would imply areduction in new construction expenditure of theorder of some  25 million in each year.6. None of the construction elements of bidsoptions shown in table 3 substantially exceed  20million in any year. The construction content of allthree bids shown reaches  20 million in at least oneyear, but only the option for reductions on&apos;motorways, trunk roads and local transport has animpact as large as this. Most of the constructionimpact of the options arises on those of the Depart-ment of the Environment and the Home Office.^nfidential137

CONFIDENTIALAnnex NANNEX NProvisional outturn and shortfall in 1978-79 and 1979-80Table Nl shows outturn in 1978-79 andprovisional outturn in 1979-80 in terms of 1980survey classifications and prices for each majorDepartment, for Government lending tonationalised industries, for the contingency reserve,for market and overseas borrowing by nationalisedindustries and for the planning total. Table N2shows the distribution of shortfall betweenspending authorities in 1979-80 compared withthat in 1978-79. The shortfall on local authorityexpenditure reflects the lack of any firm informa-tion on which to base estimates of outturnk most services in 1979-80. The overall positionon shortfall in 1979-80 may change when better in-formation on outturn is available.1 The figures for outturn are those shown in the1980 survey baseline. The percentage shortfall for1978-79 has however been calculated on the basis[usedfor tables 5.4 and 5.5 in Cmnd. 7841, that is thepercentage difference between the planned figure inCmnd. 7049 (amended for subsequently announced[changes) and the outturn given in Cmnd. 7841, bothexpressed in terms of the 1979 survey classificationsand prices. This is not exactl y consistent with the(more recent) estimates of outturn in absoluteamounts, but resources were not available to trans-late the figures in Cmnd. 7049 on to the basis of the1980 survey. However, the results provide a fairbasis for comparison with the 1979-80 analysisexcept for the PSA and civil superannuation. In theanalysis of 1978-79, all expenditure by the PSA wasattributed to that Department and not to others:this is not likely to have a significant effect on thepercentage shortfall of the other Departments, but a[meaningful figure for the residual PSA shown in the1980 survey cannot be calculated. Civil super-annuation in the analysis of 1978-79 shortfall wascombined with other CSD expenditure and thus notpvailable for inclusion in table Nl.!  The inherited planned expenditure shown for[1979-80 in table Nl is defined as the planned figurefen in Cmnd. 7439 revalued and reclassified on to&quot;ie 1980 survey basis and amended to take account f policy changes announced by the lastAdministration   minus  250 million from theswitch of refinancing of export credit to the bankers(19/4/79), plus  15 million additional overseas aid(10/1/79),  2-5 million on hill farming compen-satory allowances (28/3/79) and  0-3 million for theadministrative costs of the pay comparabilityCommission (7/3/79). The following changesannounced by the present Administration areshown in the next column:12/6/79 Budget measures         1,228 on programmes     250m on the contingencyreserve12/6/79 CAP price fixing     - -t 9-9m13/6/79 Social security benefits(uprating)   -rfl99-5m22/10/79 Assistance with fuelcosts   + 5-7m22/11/79 Hill livestockallowances   + 16-5mThe revaluation of Cmnd. 7439 has been carried outat economic category level for each departmentalsub-programme. Announced changes have been re-valued using the implied revaluers from survey1979 to survey 1980 for the relevant departmentalsub-programme.4. The analysis shows shortfall in 1979-80 to be(provisionally)  1,926 million in 1980 survey pricesor 2-4% of the planning total, that is 70% of thelevel in 1978-79. One reason for variation betweenplan and outturn was the low rate of inflation thathas been assumed in the inherited plans (Cmnd.7439). This contributed, for example, to theunusually large shortfall in the volume of socialsecurity shown in Table Nl and also to an over-spend in interest support provided by ECGD. Twoother important factors will have affected the levelof shortfall in 1979-80 compared with that ofprevious years. First, three months after the yearhad begun, the present Administration reduced theexpenditure planned by the previous Adminis-tration by some  2-9 billion, i.e. 3-5% of the initialplanned level. Secondly, cash limits were set at sucha level that the planned volume was not expected tobe achieved given the likely actual levels ofinflation; this effect is estimated in total to be theequivalent of  1,025 million:  690m on centralgovernment expenditure and  335m on localttNFIDENTIAL141
CONFIDENTIAnnex Nauthority capital expenditure. Thus a minimumshortfall of just under half the shortfall now esti-mated would have occurred without any net under-spending of cash limits. It has not been possible tocalculate this effect for each Department, althoughit is likely to vary in relation to both the proportioof expenditure which is cash limited and threlativity between the rates of inflation applying ta Department&apos;s expenditure.142CONFIDENTI
