C(67) 125 COPY NO.7th July, 1967CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:  PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer this paper takes accou.ni of the fact that the Cabinet has not finally decided what the total reduction in expenditure in 1970-71should be. but is based on individual adjustments which would total 5 00 million.    It will be seen that, if a reduction on this scale wasmade, public expenditure would then increase by a total of  1,120million over the period up to 197 0-71 instead of the  1,620 millionprojected on the basis of the continuation of existing policies (thefigures are summarised in Note 6 to C(67) 104).    The following paragraphs accordingly discuss the areas of expenditure to which weshould look and the amounts which we might hope to save in each area.defence. The Cabinet has agreed a reduction in the Defence Budget by atleast  200 million by 1970-71.Transport3.     As I said in C(67) 104 (paragraph 8(a)), expenditure on thetransport sector is estimated to rise from  800 million in 1967-68 to 970 million in 1970-71.    Expenditure under this broad heading fallsinto three categories:-(a) Roads(b) Other transport, excluding railway deficit(c) Railway deficit,(a) and (b); Roads and other expenditure excluding railway deficit(C(67) 102, pages 105-6, 120-122: these references, and those below,are to the print, not to the typed version)4.      Expenditure under these headings will total  844 million in1970-71.    In addition the Minister of Transport has put forward new proposals costing about  5 0 million in that year.     These consist of s-  million(i)	Infrastructure Grants	29(ii)	Road Safety	31(iii)	Transport Research	(iv)	Rural Bus Assistance	ii(v)	Bus re-equipment grants	10(vi)	Additional Bus Fuel Tax Rebates	7-1-DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
These are the  5 0 million of &quot;further proposals&quot; included in column 5of the table in Note 6 to C(67) 104.    Because the  50 million for these further proposals was included in the 1970-71 total of  15,641 millionreferred to in paragraph 3(iii) of C(67) 104, a decision not to proceedwith any of them would produce a saving.5.     I recommend that a saving of  50 million should be achieved onthe planned expenditure of  894 million in 1970-71 (i. e. the  844 millionplus the  50 million further proposals).    I have invited the Minister ofTransport to consider how this saving of  50 million could best beachieved, and make proposals to Cabinet accordingly.    The savingmight be found:-(a) in part by scaling down the &quot;further proposals&quot;;(b) in part by investigating the possibilities of makingcharges for use (as distinct from taxation), e. g. byturnpike trusts for motoways or by special charges for &quot;wear and tear&quot; by heavy lorriesj(c) in part by reductions in the road programme.Railway deficit (C(67) 102, page 120)6.      This will need to be treated separately from other transportexpenditure,    A new financial structure for the railways is beingevolved in the Joint Steering Group which could greatly affect the size of the deficit grant.    Moreover, apart from policy decisions whichmight be taken as a result of this examination, the out-turn on current account, as with all nationalised industries, is liable to fluctuate forother reasons, such as the state of the economy, changes in demand for particular traffics, the timing of price and wage   changes, etc.    It istherefore not practicable to make other transport expenditure dependenton the results of the railways in particular years, though the expectedtrend in the deficit is a factor to be taken into account in looking attransport as a whole.    With all the reservations inherent ha this situation it is reasonable to aim to reduce the expected deficit by 30 million.     This should, in my view, be attainable if determinedefforts are made to improve productivity; to eliminate surplus capacity,e. g. by single-tracking and resignalling; and to ensure that, exceptfor the lines which we retained and subsidised for social reasons, the network is operated in all respects as a commercial undertaking.     i recommend accordingly.Housing  (C(67) 102, pages 107-9 and paragraph 8(b) of C(67) 104)7.     For Great Britain as a whole, public sector housing will cost 1,018 million in 1967-68, and on the basis of &quot;existing policies&quot; itwould rise to  1,149 million in 1970-71.     This is  45 million morethan the increase which we envisaged on the &quot;basic&quot; programme oflast year, the excess being mainly due to the adoption of &quot;ParkerMorris&quot; standards.    By 1970 there will be few remaining local shortages and a large surplus of houses over households.    On the otherhand there will be many slums and unimprovable properties to replace.The emphasis will shift increasingly to this, to improving &quot;twilighthouses&quot; and to catering for higher standards generally.     There is a growing body of opinion that we should not force the programme to top5 00, 000, since there may not be demand for so many new houses asadjustments to the changed situation take place,
SECRE I548*      I recommend a saving of about 3 per cent ( 33 million) in1970-71 on the whole Great Britain programme.    This would imply areduction in starts in 1970 from 242,000 to 232, 000.     The English and welsh share of this would be about   27 million, involving a reductionin starts in England and Wales of about  8, 000.    It may prove thatScotland will not in fact achieve their target and for that reason I wouldnot impose any formal cut,9.      The ways in which modifications could be made are:-(a) starts of public sector houses in the United Kingdom in1970 should not exceed 232, 000, which would achieve a saving of  33 million in 1970-71;(b) the Minister of Housing and Local Government should advise Cabinet on what measures should be taken to stimulate building of houses by the private sector,and to what extent the cost of such measures wouldoffset the  33 million saving.Education (C(67) 102, pages 109-U0, and paragraph 8(c) of C(67) 104)10.     I recommend a net saving of  45 million in expenditure on education in 1970-71, after allowing for any additional expenditure for making a start on the development of primary education on thelines proposed in the Plowden Report.    The Secretary of State for education and Science has been invited to make proposals designedto achieve the required saving by a combination of some or all of thefollowing measures(a) postponement of the raising of the schooTleaving age;(b) investigating the possibilities of substituting loans for part of student grants.The previous decision to raise the price of school meals needs to beconsidered in the context of proposals on family endowment and cannotbe regarded at this stage as available to meet the cost of theeducation programme.Health  (C(67) 102, pages 111-112, and paragraph 8(d) of C(67) 104)11.     Cabinet should invite the Minister of Health to advise on what measures could be taken to scale down the steep increases in staffsforecast both for the hospitals and for local authority welfare services.Local environmental services  (C(67) 102, pages 131-13212.     This block is now expected to take  882 million in 1970-71 - anincrease of  150 million over 1967-68,    Apart from the biennialnegotiations on the rate support grants, our most effective way ofcontaining this block is to reduce the capital element, upon which muchof the increase in current expenditure depends.    Reductions should bemade in the proposed capital expenditure broadly on the lines suggestedin C(67) 102 (page 131, sub-paragraph (b)(1)),
Remaining expenditure13.     There are a large number of lesser blocks of expenditure which,on present policies, are forecast to rise fast over the next few years.These includes-  millionCivil defence (and strategic stocks)        22 27Government research and technologicalsupport for industry                               96 122Police and prisons                                   288 348Fire services                                           62 72Public buildings, United Kingdom           67 84In addition there are other blocks (e. g. overseas representation and information) which show no great rise, but which offer the chance ofsome saving.     There are a multiplicity of possibilities here,  mostlyrelatively minor, but between them offering a substantial contributionto our target.14.     I recommend that officials should be instructed to examine these possibilities, and that I should later recommend for approval by ministers before the end of October proposals wh ich would, after making any necessary allowance for new proposals (e. g. on aerospaceprojects), secure net savings totalling  5 0 million, as compared withthe &quot;existing policies&quot; figures, from the remainder of public expendi-ture (other than Social Security and Overseas Aid, which I deal with separately below).Social Security   (C(67) 102, pages 113-114, and paragraph 9 of C(67)104)15.     Additional expenditure will be involved in new measures for family endowment from the beginning of 1968-69.     These &quot;transfers&quot;involve higher taxation;  and whether this takes the form of contributionsor of ordinary central Government taxation, the weight of taxation is increased.    As I showed in my earlier paper, this will rise from38 per cent of the GNP to about 40 per cent if we moderate theincrease in public expenditure by  5 00 million.    Higher direct taxation may well hold down the growth in consumption which theworking population might ordinarily hope to achieve from their higherearnings.    For the purpose of this paper I have assumed that (a) thenext uprating after October of this year will be in October, 1969, andthat (b) in those two years real earnings will increase at 3 per cent perannum.    An uprating which compensated fully for price increases in theperiod and on top of that gave half the increase in real earnings would save nearly  70 million in 1970-71 compared with the estimate includedin the overall figures before us now.    This saving would be reduced bythe amount of any additional expenditure on family endowment, perhapsbetween  20 million and  60 million.-4-
Aid (C(67) 102, pages 116-118)16.     The Aid programme was reduced by cuts and deferments from 225 million to  205 million as part of the July, 1966 measures.    Thetotal for 1970-71 on the basis of the continuation of existing policy is 225 million (C(67) 102, page 116).    If we are to achieve defencereductions of at least  200 million, mitigating aid to Singapore and malaysia may well cost an additional  20- 25 million.    The normalaid programme (exclusive of this mitigating aid and the  5 million aid to which we are committed as part of the cereals agreement in the kennedy Round) should continue at  205 million, in money terms, inthe years up to and including 1970-71,    On this basis total aid in1970-71 would amount to  205 million, plus up to  25- 30 millionmitigating and Kennedy Round Aid,    Expenditure on aid in 1970-71 must therefore be expected to exceed the &quot;existing policy&quot; figure ( 225 million)by  5 to  10 million.17.     This consideration of possible savings in 1970-71 may besummarised as follows(i)    Defejncej the Defence Budget to be reduced by at least  200 million (paragraph 2).(ii)    Roads and other transports   the Minister of transport to propose means of saving  50 million on roads andother expenditure on transport excluding the railwaysdeficit (paragraphs 3-5).(iii) Railways deficit; the railways deficit to be reduced by 30 million (paragraph 6),(iv) Housing:   33 million to be saved on public sector housing; the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentto advise on whether measures should be taken to stimulate housebuilding by the private sector(paragraphs 7-9),(v)   Educations   the Secretary of State for Education and science to propose means of saving  45 million net(paragraph 10).(vi)   Health; the Minister of Health to advise on measuresto reduce staff increases in hospitals and welfare services (paragraph 11).(vii)    Local environmental services; capital expenditure tobe reduced by  20 million (paragraph 12).(viii)   Remaining expenditure:  officials to make proposals fornet savings totalling  50 million (paragraphs 13-14).
(ix)   Social security; a saving of  70 million to be made onthe next uprating after October this year;   thissaving would be offset by between  20 million and  60 million additional expenditure on family endowment (paragraph 15).(x)   Aid; additional expenditure of up to  5 to  10 million(paragraph 16),18.     The effect of these recommendations is set out in Annex A.The total savings recommended in paragraphs 2-14 amount to about 430 million,     To this must be added  70 million on social security benefits, offset by  20 million to  60 million on family endowment,and  5 million to  10 million on aid.    The net total savings which i recommend, therefore, total about  430 million to  475 million.19.     K we are to secure the full  500 million, therefore, we shallhave to look to increases in charges for the balance of between 25 million and  70 million.    Separate papers will be circulated onthe possibilities in this field.CONCLUSION20,     I invite mv colleagues to endorse the proposals set out above.L0 J, C.Treasury Chambers, S. W, 1,7th July, 1967
