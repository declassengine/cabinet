loCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67) 132 COPY NO.11th July, 1967CABINETFAMILY ENDOWMENTMeraorandum by the Minister of Social security in his paper (C(67) 131)the Chancellor of the Exchequer makes astrong plea that we should adopt a housing allowance scheme as themeans of dealing with poverty among children.    This proposal bringsus back again to the fundamental question whether we are prepared to contemplate an extension of direct means-testing for the fathers of families in work, a measure which the Cabinet have hitherto been unwilling to adopt.2.      The fundamental argument in the Chancellor&apos;s paper seems tobe that &quot;there is growing public opinion that help should be concentratedwhere it is most wanted&quot;.    I would not dispute that this is so  but Ibelieve that in deciding the right course to adopt on this importantissue we ought to look behind facile and only partially informed viewspropounded in the Press.    There will always be plenty of people infavour of this means-testing - for others,    The Chancellor goes onto suggest that there is little evidence that people would object to anotherdirect means test and plenty that they do not.    This seems to me to ignore a good deal of evidence of which I am only too conscious.We know for a fact that the Trades Union Congress, and many of our supporters, and of course the Child Poverty Action Group, would objectstrenuously to a means-tested solution.    My own Family Survey hasshown that either there is a great deal of resistance to means-testingamong those liable to undergo it, or that means-tested answers can be relatively ineffective.    Of the families eligible for free school mealswith the father in full-time work, only about one-quarter are receivingthem.    For welfare milk, the proportion is even smaller.    Only about60 per cent of the families in the Survey with fathers sick or unemployed and apparently eligible for national assistance were in fact receiving it.Even where the elderly are concerned, we must be careful to draw theright lessons from the success of the supplementary pension scheme.While it is true that the scheme has produced 5 00, 000 successful newclaimants, an analysis of the figures shows that they were for thegreater part people becoming eligible for   the first time as a result ofthe more generous disregards of the new scheme, and we are probablystill a long way short of attracting all the old people whom the survey of retirement pensioners showed to be in the greatest need.-1-
3.     Equally, I think that the Chancellor^ view of the effect of his proposed scheme on incentive is both unsupported by evidence andoptimistic.    The Family Survey showed that only about one-seventh ofthe fathers of deficient families suffered from disabilities limiting theirearning capacity.    As to the rest, I would concede that a proportionprobably have little chance of adding to their earnings by greater effort.Nevertheless, I can see no reason for doubting that the readiness of theremainder to work overtime or accept promotion or even to maintain their present earnings, is likely to be blunted by a scheme which wouldmean that they were no better, or only a little better, off if they stroveharder.4i      The Chancellor refers in his paragraph 16 to the difficulties ofrelating family allowances to child tax allowances.    I would not denythat they exist and are not completely soluble.    It is, however, easy to exaggerate their extent.     They would make a relatively few peoplewhom we wanted to help worse off and in most cases only forrelatively short periods.     On the other hand, the Chancellor issilent about the difficulties of the rent allowance scheme.    This would,by definition, be designed as an income maintenance scheme for theleast well off, and related, however indirectly, to supplementary benefit.    This last is on a weekly basis, but on grounds of administrativeexpense alone, the housing allowance would have to operate six months in arrears and must, therefore, in some cases, e. g0 where earningsfluctuate seasonally, generate payments out of phase with the actualincidence of hardship.5.      Nor does the Chancellor^ paper recognise a number of problems which seem to me to be associated with his scheme.    Firstly, to put it higher, it must surely reduce the enthusiasm of local authorities tointroduce, at any rate for families, rent rebate schemes on the modelrecommended in the recent circular.  It could hardly fail to leadeventually to local authorities adapting their rent rebate schemes to exclude families with children, thus substantially increasing the cost ofthe housing allowance scheme.     Nor should we forget that there might be some effect on private rents.    Secondly, there is the possibility thatthe scheme might have to be extended to childless married couples andsingle persons, to whom it could perfectly well, and logically ought to,be extended.     Thirdly, some people and organisations would, I think,argue that, if we are willing to adopt means-testing at all, we should at least do so in a way which lifts 100 per cent, and not 86 per cent, ofthe deficient families up to or above the supplementary benefit level,i. e, that if means-testing must be the chosen method, it should take theform of straightforward supplementation of earnings,6,     In comparing the effects of alternative schemes, the chancellor has understated the effects of the scheme which I favour.    The proportionof children in families which would foe brought up to or above the supplementary benefit level by a 10s. give -and-take scheme would be65 per cent.     On the other hand, the corresponding proportion for thehousing allowance scheme would be appreciably less than 86 per cent.The total cost of the Chancellor&apos;s proposals is between  43 million and 48 million a year as compared v/ith a net annual cost of  32 million for a 10s, give-and-take scheme.    As was shown in Annex B to my paper (C(67) 7), for an annual net cost of  45 million one could have agive-and-take scheme with an increase of 15s. in the family allowance for the second and   subsequent children which would lift 68 per cent of families and 80 per cent of children out of the &quot;deficient&quot; area.-2-
7.     It would be wrong of me to join issue with the Chancellor over theway in which revenue should be raised in order to finance whatever isthe chosen scheme.    I would only make the following comments onparagraphs 14 and 15 of his memorandum.    He envisages that if theCabinet adhere to their previous decision, there should be some reduction in child tax allowances, notwithstanding the difficulty of reconciling this with an increase in family allowances.    The cost ofhis proposed housing allowance scheme is of the same order as the net cost, in an ordinary year, of the give-and-take scheme with a 10s.increase of family allowances which I favour.    That scheme would helpmore families only a little way above the supplementary benefit levelvand on the grounds which I set out in my earlier memorandum (C(66) 183)I would regard this as a positive advantage.    This advantage wouldseem to me all the greater if we are, in fact, going to make all families with children above the chosen level of special support worse off by increasing charges for school meals and perhaps other charges also.8.      Linked with the proposed housing allowances, the Chancellorproposes to increase family allowances across the board for the fourth and subsequent children at the cost of a further   13 million a year.I am sure it is right to do something as soon as we can for the worstoff families, but the particular combination of measures advocated bythe Chancellor has the curious result that the improvement for thelargest families must at best be indiscriminate or at worst could be&quot;subsumed&quot;, wher. che housing allowance scheme came along, only forthe least well off.    A give-and-take scheme would avoid this anomalousresult.M. H0Ministry of Social Security, W. C. 2.11th July, 1967
