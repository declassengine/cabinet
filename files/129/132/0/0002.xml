COMF5DENT1AL3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC IvIAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67) 1225th July, 1967COPY NO.UIdCABINETROAD HAULAGE POLICY:  PROPOSALS FOR THE REVISIONOF THE CARRIERS&apos; LICENSING system memorandum by the Minister of TransportIntroduction and SummaryIn &quot;Time for Decision&quot; the Government undertook &quot;to co-ordinateroad and rail to use existing resources to best effect&quot;.    In the White paper on Transport Policy (Cmnd. 3057, paragraph 99) published in July, 1966,the Government accepted the view that the present carriers1 licensing system for goods verucles was wasteful, ineffective and unduly complicated,but held that instead of abolishing licensing altogether it was necessary to devise a licensing system which v/ould be &quot;an effective instrument of a modern, national freight policy&quot;.     This paper describes my proposals.Discussion at the Economic Policy Committee revealed that some of mycolleagues are concerned about certain features which are likely to be controversial.    Hence this reference to the Cabinet.2.      I am proposing two main changes(i)  To free altogether from carrier licensing the 900,000 goods vehicles under 30 cwt. unladen weight, and to apply to the remaining600,000 a form of licensing (quality licensing) designed to improvemaintenance and operating standards for the protection of public safety.(ii)   To free from all except quality licensing a further 140, 000 publichaulage vehicles (including all those under 5 tons and a few over 5 tons)which are at present required to hold &apos;A1 or &apos;B&apos; licences, but to applyto the remaining 40,000 public haulage vehicles and to 30,000 own account vehicles a new system of quantity control which will produce a more rational economic division of traffic between road and rail.3.       The White Paper (paragraph 98) stated that decisions about therecommendations of the Geddes Committee on the licensing system should await the outcome of current research into the relative costs of carrying goods by road and rail.     Good progress has been madewith this research and it is already clear that its findings will not conflict with my proposals and in particular respects will validatethem.    It is therefore not necessary to await completion of thisresearch, which will take another year at least, before adaptingthe licensing system as I propose to speed up the transfer of acomparatively small amount of traffic from road to rail wherethere is spare capacity that can profitably be used to carry it,with a consequential reduction of some  6 million in the deficit,I have set out in greater detail at Annex A the relationship between this research into transport costs and my proposals.
The Existing Carriers&apos; Licensing System4,      Licensing of goods vehicles was initiated by the Road and rail traffic Act, 1933, and the present system which is described more fully in Annex Bis substantially the same as it was then.    Its purposes were toregulate competition within the road haulage industry, in view ofdepressed conditions arising from rapid unregulated expansion;to protect the safety of the public and of the drivers by providingsanctions against operators of unsafe lorries;  and to give some protection to the railways by allowing them to object, along withother road hauliers, to the grant of licences to public haulage operators.But the system no longer effectively achieves these objectives, and the objectives themselves need to be reconsidered in the light of modernneeds,The Objectives of Licensing5.       There is no need now for the regulation of competition between public hauliers.    Road haulage is a strong and vigorous industry and likely to remain so.    It has not suffered any noticeable economic damage from the ineffectiveness of the present system and there is no sense inretaining a control which no longer has any meaning in practice,6,       But the protection of public safety by the promotion of high standards of maintenance and operation within the industry is evenmore important now that it was in 1933,    Roads are more crowded,vehicles more powerful, and the incentives to break the lav/ for financialgain remain.     Yet the existing system allows no enquiries into the suitability and competence of intending operators, and its disciplinary actions over existing operators have proved totally inad.equate.     Wemust change this situation radically.7.      I have been under considerable pressure from the unions torenationalise the public haulage industry.    One of their main argumentsis that the industry is dominated by tne small operator, who3e standards of operation are substantially lower than those of operators in the publicly owned sector, who are as a consequence at a competitive disadvantage.No less than 50 per cent of public hauliers operate only one vehicle and85 per cent operate five vehicles or less.    I have resisted renationalisationof the v/hole industry because I see serious disadvantages in establishing afreight transport monopoly.     Moreover, as we saw after 194-7, nor enationalisation v/ould be effective which left out the larger own-accountfleets.    I have maintained that the problem of low standards in certain sections of the industry could and should be dealt with by licensing backed by more vigorous enforcement.8,       There is, I believe, a second valid objective of a licensing system.    It is a primary aim of my freight policy that the fullesteconomic use should be made of the basic railway network.     Therailways1 investment in liner trains and bulk delivery services isgiving thern modern facilities for carrying long haul and bulk trafficsmore efficiently and cheaply in many cases than road transport.     Onthese services the railways can offer competitive charges and still makeprofits.    In the main, the new services will sell themselves on their merits.    But the understandable reluctance of some consignors to entrust their goods to the railway is likely to delay this natural switch-2-
to rail,    Meantime spare rail capacity will be wasted.    If this &quot;reluctant&quot;traffic can be induced to switch to rail at an earlier date, without any additional costs being imposed on industry, there will be a clear gainto the economy in terms of optimum use of transport resources, reductionof the railways deficit and less congestion on the roads,    I, therefore,believe v/e should retain quantity control, but in a new and more relevantform in which it will be limited to that part of the road haulage industrywhere it can contribute to switching suitable traffic to rail.Proposals for a Mew System9.       I propose, as a first step, to exempt from all carriers&apos; licensingthe 900, 000 light vehicles of less than 30 cwt, unladen weight - nearly alloperated on own-account and mostly light delivery vans and tradesmen&apos;svehicles used for local runs only.     There are no economic grounds forsubjecting them to quantity control.    As regards quality control, mostof these vehicles are operated in towns and, though their accident rateis high, the accidents in which they are involved tend to be less serious than those involving heavier vehicles.     Thus, the number of deaths fromfatal accidents per vehicle-mile is 40 per cent higher for lorries over30 cv/t. than for those below.     Moreover, vehicles under 30 cwtn will still be subject to the same annual tests as private cars and also at anytime to roadside spot-checking by my examiners.    So v/e have a qualitycheck on these vehicles.    I have, therefore, decided to concentrate the controls of the new system on the 600,000 heavier goods vehicles over30 cwt. rather than dissipate enforcement effort over the whole range of 1. 5 million goods vehicles.Quality Controls10.       I propose that the ba.sic instrument of control in future should bea new type of carrier&apos;s licence.    Such a licence would be granted only if:-(a) The Licensing Authority were satisfied that the applicant intendedand was able to provide adequate maintenance facilities for his vehicles,to keep proper control over their loads and to arrange satisfactory checkson the hours worked by his drivers.(b) The Licensing Authority v/ere satisfied that the applicant&apos;financial resources v/ere commensurate with his proposed scale of operation and that he had sufficient business in prospect to maintainreasonable financial stability.(c) The applicant held a new type of personal licence (a &quot;transportmanager&apos;s licence&quot;), entitling him to manage a transport undertaking,or employed the holder of such a licence in a position of responsibility.The licence would be revocable for malpractice,11,        These criteria are designed primarily to uphold proper standards of conduct and operation in the industry and in particular to protect public safety.    Power to investigate the applicants financial prospects isnecessary because the most common and immediate reaction of hauliersin financial difficulties is to neglect maintenance, overload vehicles andoverwork their drivers.    We should not continue to tolerate a state ofaffairs in which anyone can buy a second-hand lorry on hire purchase for a few pounds deposit and a prospect of a few cut-rate contracts,neglect its maintenance and so become a menace on the roads,
120      Some of my colleagues on the Economic Policy Committeeexpressed doubts about the feasibility of assessing an applicantsfinancial resources and prospective business.    I have discussed this again with some of my licensing authorities, and I am convincedthat the difficulties are exaggerated.     The majority of applicants willhave been operating goods vehicles for a number of years and the licensing authorities will have a great deal of information to assist them in their assessments and to pinpoint bad risks.    Under thepresent system they seek to satisfy themselves about an applicantsreliability and efficiency, and they see no serious difficulty in making this financial assessment, which would enable them to deal more effectively with an operator whose past record in caring for hisvehicles and observing the other requirements of road operationhas been unsatisfactory.    It is all the more important that suchenquiries should be made since otherwise we should be opening the door for unscrupulous operators out for quick profits to putunsafe vehicles on the road, including, possibly, some who hadbeen refused a licence under the resent system.    This would goundetected until the vehicle either came up for its annual test or was caught at a random roadside test.    But in between annual teststhe vehicle can do a considerable mileage, while the chances of its being examined in a random roadside test are about once every fiveyears.13.      I propose, however, to make these financial tests discretionaryand not mandatory and leave it to the licensing authority to decide whento apply them.    There will be a number of cases in which, they will be clearly unnecessary.     There will be others in which it is not clear whether the applicant has adequate financial resources and the licensing authority will then need to ask him for irtformation in this point.    If it then transpires that the applicant is a man of straw, the licensing .authority can reject the application.    In this way the more obviouslybad risks can be eliminated from the starts    \7here the licensing authority does not feel justified in rejecting an application outright, hewill be able at his discretion to grant what would in effect be aprobationary licence of short duration.    Such a licence would be givento many applicants new to the industry;  it might also be granted, in afew cases, to an operator already in the business whom the licensing authority has reason to suspect.    Otherwise licences will be given fora longer period,    (Another remedy open to the licensing authority indoubtful cases would be to license a smaller number of vehicles manthat applied for. )14.      It has been suggested as an alternative that quality licencesshould be available on demand but be subject to revocation for subsequent infringements, on the ground in particular that it wouldrequire less manpower than my proposals.    Apart, however, fromthe safety objectives to this alternative it would involve a heavy increasein the number of enforcement staff.    Nor will rny proposals as a wholeinvolve any substantial increase in the numbers now administeringcarrier licensing since the increase in enforcement and executive staff for quality licensing will be largely offset by the savings from the exemption of a million vehicles from licensing.    There will be a need-4-
for a higher proportion of senior staff in the Traffic Areas, but the extra cost of this will be met from the charges made for carriersTlicences since I intend that the system shall continue to be self-financing.The staffing implications of my proposals have been discussed with theTreasury.15.       Once a licence has been issued, there will be two lines of attack against a defaulting operator.    First, whenever there has been a breach of the law relating to vehicle operation the licensing authority will berequired to consider suspending or cancelling the licence discs of theoperator&apos;s individual lorries.    Second, if an operator^ offences arepersistent or are of a reckless character or likely to cause particulardanger to the public, he will be liable to have his operator^ licencesuspended or cancelled.    In either case the position of the holder of theTransport Manager&quot; s licence in that organisation will be called inquestion.    To escape revocation or suspension of his own licence hewill have to show that he could not be held responsible for the state ofaffairs in the company.    This will give him a powerful incentive to resist any pressure by his employers to break safety rules.    Therewill, of course, have to be provision for appeals;  I am still consideringthe form of these.16.      Licences of ihis kind, which involve prior examination of financial resources, are already required in Germany and the Netherlands, andhave recently been instituted in France,    My officials have discussed with the Germans the working of their system, which is closely similarto my own proposalst and have been told that the financial tests present no serious difficulty, and are of value in securing safe operation.    Itis likely that licences on a similar pattern will eventually be introducedthroughout the European Economic Community (e.c.).    I know that inthis country their introduction would be welcomed by both sides of theindustry and I am confident that they would make a worth whilecontribution to safety.Quantity Controls17.      Under the present system of carrier licensing an applicant fora haulier&apos;s licence has at least in theory to prove a need for his proposedservice.    In practice he has little difficulty in producing customers tosupport his case and the system has become a farce.    The Trades UnionCongress (TUC) and British Railways have pressed for a system whichwill effectively support a national freight policy.    The TUC indeed have gone further and asked that all licensing shall be delegated to areconstituted British Transport Commission.    I cannot accept this, butI do accept the need for radical change.    British Railways have represented that there is a quantity of traffic now moving by road which would be eminently suitable for carriage by freightliner andassess the quantity at some 30 million tons per annum.    They believethat the new service will attract on merit one-half of this traffic but have urged that a licensing system is essential to divert the remainderfrom road haulage.    I consider that this justifies a very limited formof quantity licensing designed to divert this traffic to the freight liners.Licensing will be needed to overcome many consignors1 convervatisrnand their prejudice against the railways derived from pre-freightliner-5-
experience.    It will also be needed to divert traffic in marginal cases.There is a large amount of bulk traffic such as coal and mineral oresmoving by road in circumstances in which it could, without detriment to the consignor and with benefit to the public interest and to the overallrail deficit, be moved by rail.18.       I propose, therefore, to apply a limited form of quantity control which will extend to all lorries, including those of own account operators,of more than five tons unladen weight engaged either (a) in hauls of over100 miles or (b) in carrying certain bulk traffics (e.g. coal) over25 miles.19.       My reasons for adopting a limit of five tons unladen weight are:(a) Lorries over five tons weight carry about half the tonnage andaccount for half the ton-mileage moving by road over 100 milesand thus include the very traffic which would be suitable forthe f reightliner service.    They also carry much of the bulkloads moving over shorter distances.(b) There are in all 100, 000 vehicles cf five tons or more (including60, 000 own-account vehicles).    The exclusion of those engaged on journeys of under 100 miles, other than thosecarrying certain bulk loads, will bring the total to 70, 000as compared with 180, 000 public haulage vehicles now subjectto licensing (see table at Annex C).    This will enable myenforcement staff to concentrate their attention on a. much smaller number of easily identified vehicles.20.      Applications for a quantity licence to operate one of these70,000 lorries will be open to objection by railway operators.    Thesystem will, therefore, be biased in favour of rail transport but for thereasons set out in paragraph 5 above there is no point in allowingobjections being raised by other operators.    In most cases the objectorwill be the freightliner division of the National Freight Organisation(NFO), since the effective alternative to road will be provided by thefreightliner services.    Occasionally the railways might object toapplications for bulk carriage of coal and similar traffic.    The solegrounds for objection will be that rail can provide a service whichoverall is as satisfactory as that of the applicant, taking into accountspeed, reliability and cost;  where such an objection is made theapplicant will have to satisfy the licensing authority that it is invalid.Unlike the present system, consignors1 preferences or prejudices willnot be taken into account unless they are substantiated with rationalevidence in these terms.    There will be provision for appeals to anindependent tribunal.21.     The extension of quantity licensing to own-account transport isnew and will give rise to controversy.    Own-account operators valuetheir freedom to operate lorries without restriction for the carriage oftheir ov/n goods.    For the most part they will retain this freedom,subject only to the new quality controls which they will, I am sure, findacceptable.    But I do not think it is right to exempt them altogether fromthe new quantity controls.    A significant proportion (at least one-third)of the traffic which is potentially suitable for rail now goes in own-accountCOMFfDENTiAL
CON Fl DE confidential .lorries; the TUG have strongly represented to me the need for quantitycontrol of own-account transport, as also have British Railways? andto confine quantity licensing to public hauliers would be likely to causediversion of the traffic previously carried by hauliers, not to rail, butto new or enlarged own-account fleets.22.      In considering contested applications licensing authorities will need for comparison competing road and rail rates which reflect the fullcosts of each service.    This will not be difficult in the case of publicroad haulage, nor for the NFO freightliner services, since thearrangements for the financial structure of the NFO will ensure thatno element of subsidy appears in their quoted rates.    But since norates will be available in own-account cases, the comparison will haveto be between rail rates and own-account costs.    Many own-accountoperators v/ill be quick to see the economic benefits of rail trunkhaulage (and a number have already made the switch to freightliner s),but there are many who do not even know what it costs them to run theirown vehicles or are content to subsidise their lorry fleets from theirmanufacturing profits.     This clearly leads to an unjustifiable waste ofnational resources.    Undoubtedly one of the effects of applying quantitylicensing to own-account operators will be to stimulate them to examinetheir transport costs, and to compare them with rail costs, withbeneficial effects o:z national productivity.Effect of Quantity Licensing on Established Fleets23.      Several of my colleagues suggested that organisations with largeestablished fleets might suffer economic loss if the quantity licensing system required transfer of traffic carried by their vehicles to rail.There will be cases where quantity licensing could make severe inroadsinto individual fleets.     But there are two mitigating factors.    The owners of these fleets will have plenty of notice that quantity licensing is likelyto affect them, not only because there will be at least nine monthsbetween the publication of my proposals in a White Paper and enactment of the Transport Bill but also because the introduction of the new controlswill have to be spaced over a period of at least two to three years as existing licences fall in.    Also the licensing authorities will have to begiven discretion to allow the continued operation of particular licences for a limited period or to a limited extent in individual cases whereimmediate rejection would cause undue hardship.    In any event  the basic criterion will have to be satisfied, can rail provide as good a service ?Refusals of Applications for Quality or Quantity Licences24.      I intend that applicants should be free as they are now to renewtheir applications at any time.    This is the real sanction against any failure of the railways to operate a reliable service and much simplerthan any indemnity system.    It v/ill also be a healthy stimulus to therailways to keep their standards up.    Even if it were practicable an indemnity system would be of doubtful value.    On one of thefreightliner routes, there is an arrangement under which a consignorwho pays a higher rate can recover the freight charge if his consignmentis delayed.    In practice the customers nearly always pay the lower rate which carries no such guarantee since the normal service is sufficientlyreliable.-7-
Interdepartmental Consultation25.      At the last meeting of the Economic Policy Committee I was askedto arrange for interdepartmental consideration of certain features of my proposals and to report the outcome to the First Secretary of Statebefore reference was made to the Cabinet.    I have done so and at annex D is a copy of my report to the First Secretary.    It will be seenthat officials reached agreement on a number of the points raised by my colleagues, but failed to agree on the possible effect of quantitylicensing on industrial costs and efficiency, especially as regards own-account transport,    I do not share the fears expressed on this scoreand neither do my licensing authorities.    They have long experience incomparing road and rail rates, and in assessing the more complexissues arising from proof of need for a new road haulage service, andtheir opinion on the feasibility of my proposals should not be lightly set aside.    I would in any case seek powers in the new Transport Bill toissue directions of a general nature for their guidance should thisprove necessary.The Common Market26.      In formulating these proposals I have kept in mind the possibilityof our joining the e.c. and the effect of this on our licensingarrangements.    The Six have not made much progress in evolving acommon transport policy, but they may do so in the field of haulagelicensing during the next six to twelve months.    I have already referred to the parallels between my quality licensing proposals andthose being evolved by the e.c..    Quantity control is applied in allCommon Market countries, though in different forms, and the principleof controlling &quot;access to the market&quot; and of limiting road haulagecapacity is firmly entrenched.    They do not apply this control to own-account transport, but there is already some Recognition that itsexclusion is illogical and West Germany imposes a special discriminatorytax on own-account operators.    I think our best course is to developour own licensing system as best suits our domestic needs, but to keep it sufficiently flexible to permit later modifications in the e.c. contextif necessary;  may be our initiative will influence the still developingpolicies of the Six.Alternatives27.      I have considered other proposals and rejected them.    Forexample a very substantial charge for long distance licences or forvehicles above a certain weight would no doubt lead to some diversion of traffic to rail.    But it would be indiscriminate and would raise costs of road transport hauls for which there was no effective rail alternativeor indeed no rail alternative at all.28.     A second possibility would be to repeal the present legislation oncarrier licensing and replace it with quality licensing alone.    But thiswould mean foregoing the opportunity to utilise the spare capacity on thefreightliner network and to reduce the rail deficit.    There would also be considerable criticism from the unions if the limited right which therailways now have to object to haulage licences were removed altogether.A variant of this proposal would be to leave the present system as it isbut with quality licensing superimposed.    But this would mean retaininga system acknowledged to be grossly defective and continuing to incur the waste of resources that it involves.
29.     Another possibility is a quota system like that in several eec countries.    But their experience does not suggest that a quota systemconfined to public hauliers would be of any assistance to the railways;the more likely effect of any such system would be to increase own-account operation.    And there is little point in developing a quota system merely to restrict entry into the public haulage side of theindustry.Conclusion30.      There being no satisfactory alternative, I seek the approval ofmy colleagues to the proposals set out in this paper as a basis for myroad haulage licensing policy.    I would consult further with the various interests concerned before framing proposals for inclusion in theforthcoming Transport Bill.B.A.C.Ministry of Transport, S.E.1.5th July, 1967-9-
ANNEX AThe relation of current^i^X^AVI^^^^h. into transportcoasts to ia,y proposals f.or carrier JLicensingI have explained in paragraph 3 of the Memorandum that I donot think it necessary to wait for the full results of ourresearch into the relevant costs of carrying goods by road or rail and into consignors&apos; preferences before making changes in the licensing system.    The object of this research is to provide information relative to road and rail investment to help usassess the consequences of a number of policies with economic implications.    Already information from this research has helpedguide our thinking in formulating my present proposals but theprogramme is not complete.    It is proceeding by a series of stages.In the first stage we are concentrating on an examination of twotypical trunk routes - between London and Newcastle and betweenSouth Lancashire and Glasgow,    v/e are collecting detailed data onthe costs of all road and rail transits which make use of these routes or of any part of them.    Prom this data we intend to baildup a mathematical  model (the transport costs model) which willenable us to examine the variations in costs which would occur onthese two routes if the balance of traffic between road and railon them were to be altered in various ways.   At the moment wehave collected and analysed a large amount of information aboutroad costs on the routes, and this is now in a form suitable foruse in the model.    The collection of rail data is not so far advanced, but we expect to complete this part of the stage in thenext month or two.    The final results of this stage are likely tobe available at the end of this year.    The next stage of the modelwill be to extend the methods used in the examination of these two groups to cover all the major trunk routes in.the countryj   we expect that completion of this work will take some considerable time.   It will be published at appropriate stages.2.     Our research also sets out to discover why consignors chooseparticular forms of transport (the &quot;shippers1 survey&quot;).    Preliminaryresults show that there is widespread ignorance among consignorsof freight about rail charges.    More than half of the firms in thesample we have taken who are now forwarding their goods by roadclearly had little knowledge of rail freight charges.   Furthermore,the railway image in respect of speed and reliability of servicestems predominantly from pre-freightliner days.    It simply cannotbe asserted that normal commercial forces, coupled with well-informed transport management, will in themselves lead to the most economic allocation of traffic.    Some additional stimulus isclearly necessary,3.     The research is also likely to show that several factors suchas the cost of accidents can on balance be expected to emphasise the advantage of carriage by rail rather than by road.4. ^ When the final results of our present research become available they will be valuable in providing cost information which will help to guide the licensing authorities in exercising their powers to grant or refuse licences.    Por example, the research will show on which particular routes diversion of traffic to rail is likely to be most beneficial both to the consignor andto the national interest.    This information will help licensing authorities to decide whether in marginal cases applications forquantity licences should be granted or not.A.
5.     It is not necessary to await the completion of the researchbefore revising the licensing system in the manner I propose.One does not need to know the exact relative costs of carryingtraffic by road or rail to justify using the licensing system to speed up the transfer of a comparatively small amount of traffic form road to rail, 15m. tons out of a total of 1,500m. tonscarried by road,which is expected by the railways to make a contribution of  6m. to the reduction of the overall deficit.    \7eknow that there is spare capacity on the railways that couldprofitably be used to carry this traffic.    I accept that itwould be futile to obtain a reduction in the deficit at the costof a higher burden on industrial costs generally.    But there isno risk of this.    My proposals will ensure that no traffic will beswitched from road to rail unless it is clearly established ineach individual case that the rail costs would be no higher thanthe road costs.
ANNEX BThe. &quot;present system of carrier licensingThe present system of carriers&apos;  licensing is set out inpart IV of the Road Traffic Act, 1960 and is largely a continuation of that introduced in the Road and Rail traffic act, 1933.   With certain minor exceptions all goods vehicles usedeither for hire or reward (public haulage)  or for carrying goodsin connection with the owner&apos;s trade or business (own ,..c countoperation) must be authorised under a carrier&apos;s licence.2.     Licences v..re issued by the Licensing authorities.    Iappoint     one     Authority for each of the twelveTraffic Areas in Great Britain, and acts independently in grantingor refusing licences,   he is supported by a small staff of executive and clerical officers, who assist in preparing casesfor decision and in keeping records of operators, but the actualdecision on a licence application is made by the licensing authority personally or his appointed deputy.3.     Own-account operators are entitled to a licence on demand,unless their previous record as an operator is such as todisqualify them from holding further licences.   This type oflicence (the &apos;C  licence)  is by far the most common- about1.3m. out of the 1.5m. goods vehicles on the road operate under it.A,     Public hauliers operate under an fAr  licence (for publichaulage only)  or sometimes a &apos;B&apos;  licence (which entitles anoperator to undertake both public haulage and own-accountoperation) .   Applications for these licences are published in a weekly list by the Licensing Authority, and are open to objectionsfrom established hauliers and from the railways on the grounds that suitable transport services already exist to do the workwhich the applicant wishes to undertake.   Where&apos; objections  aremade, the Licensing Authority will usually preside at a public\hearing, at which the objectors attempt to prove their objection^and the applicant brings evidence from prospective customers to;show the need for his services.5.     If the Licensing Authority grants an ,AI licence, its use isrestricted mainly to the type of work which the applicant statedhe intended to undertake.   A &apos;B&apos;  licence is usually furtherrestricted by specific conditions laying down precisely what theoperator may or may not do under its authority.   Breaches of conditions may lead to withdrawal of the licence.6.     &apos;A&apos; licences normally last for 5 years, and &apos;B&apos;  for 2.   the holder may have to undergo the same process of proof of needeither on renewal or whenever he wishes to increase the size ofhis fleet.7.     Licensing Authorities also have certain limited powers to revoke or suspend a carrier1s licence (of any kind)  in the eventof serious or repeated offences against the law governing vehiclemaintenance and observance of the limits on drivers&apos; hours.   Theyare^ served by staffs of engineers and technically qualifiedvehicle examiners who examine vehicles and report cases of badmaintenance both for possible action against the carrier&apos;s licenceand for prosecution in the courts.    Similarly, their staff oftraffic examiners investigate breaches of the law on hours of driving and check observance of licence conditions.
8.     The system is in practice far less restrictive than might appear from this brief description.    Only the 200,000 publichaulage vehicles are subject to any kind of quantity control,and it is not difficult for an applicant to produce customers whowill say they wish to use his services.    This is frequentlysufficient to secure the grant of a licence, since the criterionof the adequacy of existing services was relegated to a secondaryplace by an amendment to the law in 1953 which provided that theneeds of customers should be paramount in the consideration of applications.    Moreover, many operators get what are virtuallypublic haulier licences under an arrangement which gives them an automatic right to a licence if they cm produce a twelve months&apos;exclusive contract with a prospective customer.    There are thusfew real restrictions on entry to the industry to a man who is determined to get in, and uny protection which the system mayonce have given to the railways has virtually disappeared.    It isclear that the system not only no longer achieves many of itsobjectives, but that these objectives themselves need to bere-appraised in the light of modern needs.

ANNEX DReport on an inter-departmental meetingof officials on 27th June1.     I was asked at the last meeting of the Economic PolicyCommittee to arrange for further inter-departmental considerationof certain features of my proposals and to report the outcome tothe First Secretary of State before the matter was referred tothe Cabinet.   Discussions have now been held between departments on these features as well as on further points raised by theParliamentary secretary,  Department of Economic Affairs, in a subsequent letter to me.    Their outcome was as follows:Quality Licensing2.     There are now no important outstanding points of differencebetween Departments on the proposals for a quality licensing system.    On the two specific points raised at the economic policy Committee meeting, it was concluded that:-(a) in the light of licensing authorities&apos;  experience inthis country and of the known effectiveness of thequality licensing systems now operating in Yvest Germanyand Prance, it would be possible to envisage applicantsbeing examined as to their financial resources and business prospects, although the Board of Trade arestill doubtful whether such a process would be successful; and the Scottish Office thought that a detailed examination of this kind would involve theGovernment in an unprecedented type of investigation;(b) apart from its manpower implications, a system underwhich licences were given out on demand and subsequentenforcement was very tough would be undesirable onsafety grounds.3.     A possible alternative system of quality control wassuggested, under which goods vehicles would be examined at six-monthly rather than annual intervals and licences issuedautomatically.   The Board of Trade saw advantage in this course,but it was pointed out that it would be extremely expensive.Quantity Licensingk.     Officials were agreed on three of the points outstandingfrom the   E, N.      Committee meeting.    They were:-(a) The question of compensation for existing own-accountoperators who were refused licences.    It was consideredthat no case could be made for such compensation,provided that suitable transitional arrangements wereworked out and that licensing authorities in consideringapplications took account of the difficulties whichmight arise in a very few cases.(b) The possibility of an indemnity on the part of therailways against failures in promised services.    Itwas accepted that this was impracticable and that thebest safeguard was that rail objections against issueof carrier licences would not succeed if the railwaysproved unreliable.rOWFiriFNTIAI
(c)    The proposal to allow an operator whose applicationwas refused to buy a licence.    It was felt that ifthe price of such a licence was low the whole purposeof the licensing system would be defeated, while if theprice were high enough to avoid this danger, the devicewould be criticised as worthless.    Moreover to be effective such a scheme would have to be accompaniedby an elaborate identification procedure.5,     On the remaining point raised at the    S . N .     Committee,the Scottish Office and the Board of Trade were unable to agreethat the proposals would not inflict serious damage upon industryin Scotland and the other development areas.    These two departments considered that even if licensing authorities weregiven special directions about dealing with road licenceapplications in these areas, and despite the safeguard thatlicences would not be imposed unless rail provided a comparableservice, industrialists would still be discouraged frominvestment in these areas by doubts about their future freedom to run their own transport.6.     The meeting also discussed certain points raised by theParliamentary Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs.These points mainly concerned the practical problems which would face licensing authorities in the administration of the newquantity system, and the difficulty of assessing and decidingupon the needs of manufacturers to operate their own lorries.Officials spent some time in discussing various aspects of these problems but were unable to agree upon a common view.   Mostdepartments were concerned about the degree of inquiry into own account operators1  costs which would apparently be necessary in considering applications for licences and about the difficultyof giving due weight to customers&apos; preferences about methods oftransport without undermining the whole system.    In general,Departments other than the Ministry of Transport-felt that, while some doubts on points of detail might eventually be resolved, theproposals for quantity licensing especially as applied to own-account transport would have serious effects on industrial costs and efficiency.   At the same time it was recognised that to apply the system to public hauliers alone would be ineffectual.Ministry of TransportUth  July, 196&quot;
