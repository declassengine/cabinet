C(67) 124 COPY NO.   ^ j7th July, 1967CABINETGOVERNMENT ACHIEVEMENTSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer circulate for the information of my&apos;colleagues a paper whichcompares progress during the first three years of the present Governmentwith that during the last three years of the last Administration in the social services and in some areas beyond them.    Figures for 1967-68 are estimated.2.       Although there is no doubt that in some fields the figures mustbe used with reserve, in recognition of the fact that what has been donein the past three years is to some extent the fruits of plans and approvalsby the last Adr.ainistra.tion, there is no doubt about the general story whichthe figures tell - improvement, and what is more, an increased pace ofimprovement, all round.     More university students;   more teachers intraining:  more schools completed;   more hospital beds;  more homes for the elderly and handicapped;  a great upsurge in the provision of health centres;  better social security benefits (in real terms, not just money)and rebates for the poorest ratepayers;   improved roads;   and an increased rate of housebuilding.    Whatever role our predecessors may have playedin laying the foundation of some part of this advance, there is no denyingthat - in spite of the difficult economic inheritance to which we succeeded -we have achieved a great deal in the 2^-3 years we have been in office.JLj.
