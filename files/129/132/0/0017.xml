Cl^JLliiZ COPY NO.__6521st July, 1967CABINETPUBLIC SECTOR PRICED&quot;With the end of the period of severe restraint we are facing asubstantial number of proposals for price increases, especially in thepublic sector (see Annex).    If we were to agree to all these proposalsour prices policy could hardly survive for long.     This seems therefore the right moment to take stock of the position and, in particular, toconsider the principles against which proposals for price increases bythe nationalised industries should be considered.Justification for a prices policy ,     The need to pursue an active and effective prices policy is not in dispute.    In the first place we can expect to secure moderation in wage and salary increases only if it can be shown that action is being taken tohold down prices.    Secondly, maintaining a continual pressure on pricesforces industry in both the public and private sector to apply itselfenergetically to achieving improvements in efficiency;, relaxation of this pressure would put us back in the position where management tends to look to price increases as the automatic remedy in every case wherethe budget is not balancing.Limitations of the prices policy.     If price restraint were pressed too far it could become self-defeating,     Restraint cannot be pressed to the point where importantfirms in an industry face insolvency; and to deprive industry of therevenue needed to build up capital can, by restricting new investment,work against efficiency.    Moreover, prices help to relate demand to thecost of production and if they are depressed too far the consumer isgiven an unfair claim on available goods with the consequent risk of increased imports and reduced exports.    Similarly, in the public sectoran attempt to hold prices when costs are going up can lead to increasingsubsidies that eventually become too big to be sustained and also bluntthe incentive to raise efficiency.4.     Prices policy must have regard to all these considerations andthe agreed criteria for price increases in the next twelve monthsrecognise that there is a limit to the pressure that the policy can apply in support of wage restraint and greater efficiency.    In the private sector the policy should at least secure delay in putting up prices andwe should expect some useful results from insistence that cost increases should as far as possible be absorbed through greater efficiency.-1-OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYJS GOVERNMENT
Public sector prices5.     We cannot expect the policy to work satisfactorily in the private sector unless it is seen to be administered effectively in the public sector.     The impact of price increases in the basic services providedby the nationalised industries is widely felt through the economy and thedecisions which are taken on the present round of proposals for price increases will have an important bearing on the prospects of maintaining a reasonably effective prices and incomes policy.    Moreover, to theextent that the nationalised industries enjoy quasi-monopolistic conditionsof supply and do not compete directly with imports the market pressures on them to eschew prices rises are weaker than in the private sector.We have therefore a double reason for doing all we can to hold down prices in the next few months.6,      In the long run the only sound way to do this is by increased efficiency and cost-reduction, for which there is in my view very greatscope in the public as in the private sector.    In the short run, however,we have (within limits and subject to carrying the Boards with us) an option which does not exist in the private sector; we can decide, as amatter of policy, to transfer some of the burden of financing those industries from the consumer to the taxpayer.7.     I am aware that the scope of this option is strictly limited.Most nationalised industries are working to financial targets which are intended not only to ensure an efficient use of resources in the economy as a whole but to provide them with a readily understandable measure of performance; and unless we think it desirable for economic or socialreasons to alter these targets,, we must not press the industries too faron price restraint when that clearly conflicts with the attainment of the targets.    Similarly, with those nationalised industries, notably therailways and London Transport, where the   target policy is temporarily in abeyance, we are working out ways of subsidising those parts of their operations which serve wider social purposes; but once this is done the criteria for price changes over the rest of their operations will have tobe the same as applies elsewhere in the public sector.8.     However, as a temporary expedient with the object of advancinglong term efficiency, I consider that over the next few critical monthsf or prices and incomes policy we should be prepared to relax theexisting financial obligations of individual nationalised industriesproposing increases in price.    I do not suggest that it would be practicable to impose a standstill on all price increases in the public sector at the present time.    But I believe that we should refuse toauthorise an increase (where the product or service in question iseconomically significant) until we have been satisfied - by the provisionof more convincing   evidence that, we have been given in the past - thatall practical steps to avoid the increase by cost reduction have beentaken or are set in train.9.      There is unquestionably scope for very big improvements inefficiency throughout British industry, whether private or publicly owned.     This is why we have set up Development Committees in theprivate sector^    I know that the nationalised corporations generally are conscious of the need to reduce costs and, encouraged by thesponsoring Departments, have already a number of useful studies underway.    But, while the need for this may not be of equal force in every-2-CONF5DEWTIAL
case, it is most desirable that progress on. the improvement of efficiency,in the nationalised industries should be speeded upu    To this end we mustdevise the means of ensuring that the industries address themselvesvigorously to such questions as manning, plant utilisation and efficiencygenerally.    I realise the importance of avoiding the appearance of trying to run the nationalised industries business for them; nor would it be practicable to try.    But we must seek to enlist their co-operation in the development of machinery to secure the objective of increasesefficiency and cost reductions, e, ga by setting up a special unit forassessment of performance whether operating within an individualindustry or independently.10.     I am fully aware of the complexities of the field that we should beentering and the appropriate machinery will need careful and detailed consideration.    But I am firmly convinced that the way of achievinggreater efficiency in nationalised industry must be explored urgently.11.     Clearly we cannot expect to settle the form of the new machinerybefore decisions have to be taken on the proposals for price increasesnow before us,    I deal with one of these -gas - in some detail below.For the rest, I consider that the proposed increase should not be approved until it is demonstrated to our satisfaction collectively thatthe nationalised industry concerned is fully alive to the need for solvingits problems by cost reduction rather than price increases and is taking action to this end, even if this should mean a delay of anythingup to three months in reaching a decision.    Those industries whichhave already made progress in this direction will obviously find thisless onerous than others.12,     I recognise that, in practice where the increase cannot be avoided by means of cost reductions, this means releasing the industrytemporarily from its obligation to achieve the agreed financial target.But, provided this relaxation of the obligations to achieve the target is limited specifically to the effects of the delay of up to three monthsmentioned in the preceding paragraph and we make clear that it is notto be taken as implyi.ng a change of the policy of financial targets infavour of a policy of subsidisation of nationalised industry, I considerthat we should be ready to resort to this as a price well worth payingif, as I hope, it results in a more effective and single minded pursuit of cost reduction by the management of nationalised industries,13.     Where, after detailed examination on these lines, public sectorprice increases have to be accepted as inevitable, the most carefulconsideration must be given to their public presentation.    This shouldinvariably feature what is being done to reduce costs and improve efficiency.    On reflection I do not think that we paid enough attention tothis, when we authorised the increase in electricity prices earlier thisyear.     Although some reference was made in the announcement to theneed for costs to be  kept under control, the impression left in thepublicls mind appears to be that prices have been put up to meet an arbitrary target and that the main cause of the increase in costs wasthe lower growth of the economy.    We must do better in future.-3-
Post Office prices14.    As far as the Post Office is concerned, I understand that thePostmaster General wishes the price increases be proposes to bereferred to the National Board for Prices and Incomes and I am infavour of this.    (The postal increases envisaged involve a radical change in the pattern of postal services which the Postmaster general will no doubt mention. )   I do not advocate automatic reference to theBoard of proposed increases in prices by nationalised industries;decisions, whether in relation to the public or private sector, to makea reference to the Board depend on all the circumstances of the case.But on the other hand development of machinery to stimulate the achievement by the nationalised industries of greater efficiency doesnot preclude the reference of a particular proposal to increase pricesif we consider that independent examination is desirable.Gas pglees15.     The arguments put forward by the gas industry to justify its proposals are in my view the weakest of those now before us.    Theindustry can look forward to cheaper gas in the 1970ts although thereis a major problem of capital investment to be met between now andthen.    Moreover, the industry has to expand its market so as to absorb within a few years two or three times as much gas as itconsumes at present and its pricing policy should reflect this.    Inthfese circumstances, it would, I believe, be right to alter thefinancial target given to the industry to reflect its changing circumstances.    Such a policy would be in accordance with the.general principles set out in the Draft White Paper (nationalised industries - a Review of Economic and Financial Objectives)circulated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the Economic PolicyCommittee (EN(67) 50).    In that Draft White Paper it is stated(paragraph 22);  &quot;It is therefore desirable that prices, in addition torecovering cost, should be reasonably related to costs at the marginand should be designed to promote the efficient use of resourceswithin industry .... In the long run the main consideration would bethe cost of supplying, on a continuing basis, those services and productswhose separate costing is a practical proposition, i, e. long-runmarginal costs&quot;,16.     I believe that it would be in accordance with these general principles, with which I agree, for us to allow for some temporaryreduction in the gas industryrs financial target.    I suggest thatthis should not be allowed to lead to individual Gas Boards runningsignificantly into deficit but that we should not seek price increasesfrom those Boards which are likely to be in balance or from thosewhich will have a small surplus but will not reach their present financial objective.    This policy would lead to a substantially lowerincrease in prices than the lower figure (5^ per cent) proposed by theMinister of Power.-4-
17.     At the same time, I think we should put further pressure on the gas Council to seek economies through improvements in productivity and efficiency and that it should be known that we are doing so.    Ihave in mind, for example, that the Council might be asked to carryfurther the work which I understand they are doing by way of systematiccomparisons of the productivities achieved in different fields by thevarious Gas Boards, their relative maintenance and other costs, etc.(We are, after all, encouraging the Economic Development Councils tomake interfirm comparisons of productivity and performance in theirown industries and there is every reason for doing the same in thepublic sector).    This might be combined with a request that theyshould prepare a manpower budget in which they seek to achievestated productivity improvements within a given time and thus eitherrelease manpower or reduce the previously expected expansion.They should also be asked to look again at their standards of manning.A review of the part that Management Consultants are playing in this field might also be of value.Conclusion18,     I invite my colleagues to agree -(i)   that we should adopt the general approach to public sector prices outlined in paragraphs 5-8;(ii)   that we should examine urgently the need to setup new machinery on the lines set out inparagraphs 9 and 1C;(iii)    that the proposals for price increases now beforeus should be dealt with as proposed inparagraphs 11 - 17.M.S.Department of Economic Affairs, S.
