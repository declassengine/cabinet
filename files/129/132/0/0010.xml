64C(67) 130 COPY NO.10th July, 1967CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:  PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS:AID programme memorandum by the Minister of Overseas DevelopmentParagraph 17(x) of the Chancellor&apos;s paper C(67) 125 says that,under his proTJOsals, expenditure on aid would rise by up to  5 million to  10 million in 1970-71,      But, as paragraph 16 of his paper shows,the normal aid programme would remain static at the level to which itwas reduced in July, 1966 -  20 million below the &quot;existing policies&quot;level.     The apparent increase is achieved only by adding in the food aid we agreed to a? part of the Kennedy Round on cereals and themitigatory aid we expect to give to Singapore and Malaysia when our troops are being withdrawn.    Food aid is an item in a commercialbargain from which v/e expect to gain advantages not connected with the aid programme.    Mitigatory aid in the Far East is part of the price weare paying for a much greater saving in our overseas military expenditure,as is recognised in paragraph 3 of the report of the Public expenditure survey Committee on Areas of Choice (C(67) 102) and in paragraph 7 ofthe Chancellor^ paper of 21st June on Public Expenditure (C(67) 104),The Chancellor recognises in paragraph 16 of his current paper -(C(67) 125) that these expenditures should be additional to the normalaid programme.     The effect of his proposals would thus be, not toincrease that programme, but to maintain for the next three years the reduction imposed as part of the emergency measures last July,2.       The proposals for the aid programme contrast with those forother major programmes.    What is at issue for these in the Chancellorlsproposals is a lowering of the rate of increa.se - under those proposalstotal expenditure v/ould rise by 8 per cent in the three years up to 1970-71,But aid would remain static throughout those years 9 per cent below thefigure approved for 1966-67,3.       The position is made worse by the fact that, under theChancellorls proposals, the aid programme, unlike nearly allother programmes, would continue to be based on current pricesinstead of constant prices.     The real value of the normal aid programme would therefore fall even mox*e,4.       In my paper of 28th June (C(67) 120), I have explained that thebalance of payments cost of the aid programme is only about one-thirdof the gross expenditure and that repayments of capital and interest,which currently run at about  60 million a year, must also be takeninto account,     The conclusion in my paper was that the balance ofpayments impact of the aid programme is not much out of line with public expenditure generally.OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
Si5.       If the programme was held at  205 million, the most immediate result would be that we should be unable to make our contribution to thereplenishment of the International Development Association (IDA) at a proper level, without damage to the bilateral programmes both for commonwealth and foreign countries which I know would cause serious concern both to the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaries.    The IDAis not only the most efficient international aid-giving body, but is of great value to developing countries, particularly Commonwealth countries andmore especially India and Pakistan.    For every pound we put into it,Commonwealth countries get  6 out and India alone gets  4,    It is alsovery beneficial to our own balance of payments, because we get 30s, inexport orders for every pound we put in,    We thus stand to gain all roundfrom a large replenishment.     The President of the International Bank is anxious that we should come forward at once with a firm indication of thelevel at which we would be prepared to contribute to the replenishment.The United States have proposed a replenishment rising to four times thepresent level, and this is supported by the Canadians and Scandinavians.We obviously cannot afford this, but I am anxious to be in a position toindicate our willingness to contribute to a replenishment at twice thepresent level;  anything less than that would in my opinion very definitelynot meet the case.6,       With an aid programme of no more than  205 million we shouldcut a very poor figure in the Second United Nations Conference on Tradeand Development next year.    We should be unable to exercise a con-structive influence and cur record would be contrasted unfavourably with that of our predecessors.     Moreover we should come in for increasing criticism from all those in Parliament and the country who believe that we should be doing more for overseas development.It was one thing to cut the aid programme for 1967-68 as an emergencymeasure;  it would be regarded as quite another to maintain that cut forthe next three years,    A relatively small relaxation in the present restrictions on the programme would, I am convinced, save us veryserious difficulty and embarrassment, -7,       I take the view that an aid programme of  225 million at constant prices is the minimum required to carry out our responsibilities accordingto our professions.    If my colleagues are not prepared to accept that, i suggest that the absolute rock bottom they should consider is a programmeof  205 million at constant prices plus  10 million in addition to allow usto offer to contribute to the replenishment of the IDA on the basisdescribed in paragraph 5 above.     This would mean that the normalaid programme would be  215 million at constant prices;  I attach importance to constant prices, since this would prevent the real valueof the programme declining as prices rose.A.G.B.Ministry of Overseas Development, S.W.1.10th July, 1967
