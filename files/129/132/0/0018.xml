C(67) 138 COPY NO.21st July, 1967CABINET65RAILWAY POLICY:  MAIN REPORT OF JOINT STEERING GROUPMemorandum by the Minister of transport i now attach a copy of the Main Report from the Joint steering group under John Morris&apos; chairmanship which I and the Chairman of theBritish Railways Board (BRB) set up to review future railway policy.    I also attach a copy of the Interim Report from the Group, which theysubmitted to me and the Chairman in January;  it was not necessaryto put this to Cabinet at the time.2.       The Main Report makes recommendations in two main fields -finance and management structure.    The financial recommendationshave to be read in conjunction with those included in the Interim report which dealt specifically with Exchequer grants for unremunerativepassenger services which BRB are required to retain on broad social and economic grounds.Grants for Unremunerative Passenger services .       These grants would cover the extent to which the revenue of eachof these services was likely to fall short of the full cost of providing theservices (including interest and depreciation).    Grants would normally be fixed on a three-year basis in advance, and would not be adjusted inarrears to conform with actual costs;  this will provide the BRB with an incentive to run the services economically, and to attract the maximumrevenue.    The effect of these grants should be that the BRB would notbe out of pocket overall on the passenger services which they arerequired to continue to provide for social reasons.    Further detailsof the proposals for these grants are set out in Section 3 of the InterimReport, paragraph 3.21 of v/hich gives details of the legislativeprovisions recommended by the Group,     These proposals were approved by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy at their meeting on 20th March and are now being incorporated in the transport bill.Main Report - finance.       The Group have concluded that, even taking account of the&quot;social&quot; grants recommended in their Literim Report and of the grants which they now recommend for track rationalisation, BRB would belikely still to be in deficit in 1974 to the extent of somewhere between 5 million and  55 million.    They accordingly conclude that thereshould be a substantial write-off of capital so as to bring the BRBto a break-even position in the early 1970s; the detailed figures forCOWFIDENTSALjCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
this capital reconstruction should be based on neither too optimistic nortoo pessimistic a forecast.     The Group further recommend that the valuation of the BRB&apos;s assets should be scaled down to what is represented by the new capital debt.    A summary of these recommendations is at paragraph 2.42.5.       The effect of the recommendations is that the whole of the&quot;suspended debt&quot; of some  700 million would now be finally written off (no interest has been paid on this debt since it was placed in suspenseby the 1962 Transport Act);   a further slice of the &quot;live&quot; capital debt v/ouldalso be written off, though detailed discussions will be necessary between my Ministry, the Treasury and BRB over the next few months to deter-mine the exact amount.6.       The writing-off of this live debt will of course reduce the BRB&apos;interest burden.    It will also have the effect of reducing the depreciationprovisions in the BRB&apos;s accounts.     This will make the immediate ne trevenue position easier, but it will also mean that the BRB v/ill in futurehave a smaller cash flow available to finance new investment.     Thisshould impose a much tighter control on future investment, both bythe Ministry and within BRB itself,7.       One important element in the financial recommendations relates to track rationalisation.     The Group reached the conclusion that, althoughthe &quot;standby capacity&quot; to which the Chairman had often referred could notbe proved to exist as a permanent element of any foreseeable railwaynetwork, there was certainly surplus capacity in the system which could and should be eliminated.     This surplus capacity is the result not somuch of excess route mileage, but of excess track mileage and signallingcapacity.    In other words, the system is not necessarily too long but inmany places it may be too wide.    The Group concluded that some 15 million a year could be saved if the system were &quot;slimmed&quot; to a capacity properly related to the expected traffic, and they recommendthat this slimming process (which will take several years) should be encouraged by a fixed grant of some  15 million in the first year,diminishing by annual steps to zero at the end of the fifth year.This would compensate the BRB for their historic liability resultingfrom the over-provision of track capacity in the past, while giving them an incentive to remove it as soon as possible.    Relevant paragraphs of the Report are 2. 20 to 2, 23 inclusive.8.       The final effect of all these recommendations, including thosein the Group&apos;s Interim Report, should be to put BRB, in the early 1970s,in a position where (after taking account of &quot;social&quot; grants) they couldbe expected to break even and to go on doing so.    There would be nofurther excuse for running into deficit and there would consequentlybe a much better basis on which to judge the efficiency of the board as a management team.     There would no longer be provision for deficitgrants from the Minister (except, perhaps, for a very short transitional period).
Main Report    Management Structure9.     The Group have concluded that the Board ought to spend far more time than it does at present on questions of broad policy and inparticular on long-term planning.    To this end they have proposedseveral specific changes, while recognising that not all the changesthey suggest can necessarily be brought about at once,10.     They recommend that ultimately the Board should consistlargely of non-functional members, and should be smaller than atpresent.    Although the members would not have specific departmental responsibilities, they would have spheres of interest and perhapsco-ordinating roles which might well change from time to time.    Thisis a pattern of organisation which is well known in the industrialworld, although many nationalised industries have Board members with specific functional responsibilities.11.     The Group recommend that there should be two members of highstatus and responsibility to cover the fields of financial policy and theco-ordination of long-range planning; they may well be Vice-Chairmen.They also recommend that the Chairman should be relieved of day-to-day responsibility by the appointment of a &quot;Chief General Manager&quot; who might well also be a Vice-Chairman or, specifically, the Deputy to theChairman.    He would co-ordinate commercial, operating andtechnical requirements in respect of both passenger and freight traffic, and would in general be responsible for the day-to-day running of  the railways.    Although the load on such a Chief General Managerwould be very heavy, he should be able to carry it with appropriatedelegation to Board members and to other staff,,12. It is not intended that the Chairman of BRB should become a mere figurehead.    He would continue to be responsible for liaison with the Government, and he would be able to spend much more time on long-term planning than is possible under the present arrangements.He would also have more time to devote to top level managementplanning problems.13.     In spite cf their general preference for non-functional board members, the Group recognise the great importance of personnel andlabour relations; they recommend that there should be a Boardmember specifically responsible for the longer term development oflabour relations in the industry.14.     The Group recommend the appointment of at least three part-time members of high ability and experience.     They also recommendthat the BRB should be required to produce a general scheme of organisation for the minister&apos;s approval on the lines of Section 4 ofthe Iron and Steel Act, 1967,     This scheme could deal in particularwith relations between the Board and the Regions, but in any case they recommend that the statutory Regional Boards set up bySection 2 of the Transport Act, 1962, should be abolished.    their recommendations on management structure are summarised inparagraphs 4. 13 to 4, 25.-3-CONFIDEMTIAL
Other recommendations13.-,     As my colleagues will see from the summary of conclusions and recommendations in Section 48 the Report deals with varioushistoric obligations on the BRB; and in particular recommends thatthese should be taken into account in the capital reconstruction whichthey recommend.    Legislative changes will be required to give effectto the Grouprs detailed recommendations, which are set out inAppendix C, or. road bridges over railways and museums andhistorical records,Consultation with the Chairman16,     I have discussed the Report with Sir Stanley Raymond, andhave told him that I would myself be disposed to accept all the main recommendations of the Report,    Sir Stanley accepts the financialrecommendations, and he also accepts some of those on management structure, including all of those involving legislation.    But he wishes to have more time to consider the rest of the re commendations onmanagement structure,, notably those in favour of a &quot;Chief GeneralManager53 and a non-functional   Board,     I am confidant that further discussion will result in acceptance of all the recommendations,17.     It follows that any new appointments which I make to the Board(e. g. the appointment of the finance and planning members which theChairman has already accepted) will be made within the framework ofthe new structure proposed by the Joint Steering Group.Viey/s of the, MmisJerjal^Committee on Economic policy.8.     I have now consulted the Committee (SN(67) 21st Meeting) andthey have generally endorsed these proposals.Further Work for the Groupj19.     The Group will be dealing in later Reports with other subjectssuch as investment control and internal financial control,, but inaddition I shall also have to consider separately whether any further changes are required in the statutory relations between the Board and ministers in the light of the new situation resulting from the presentr e c oimae agenda tions.PabJ.ici.ty_20.     The Report, is confidential and should remain so for the present,but it will be necessary to consider the extent to which it, and inparticular the recommendations? should be made public in due course.The main recommendations should certainly be included in one of theWhite Papers on Transport Policy which I propose to publish in theautumn.    I shall be considering with the Chairman of BRB whether theReport as a whole, or an edited version., should be published, andthere will be appropriate consultation with my colleagues on the subject,
Conclusion21.     I am anxious to obtain my colleagues&apos; agreement immediately to the implementation of the main recommendations in the attached report, so that the Parliamentary draftsmen can make an immediatestart with the drafting of the necessary provisions for the transport bill,22,     I therefore seek my colleagues5 comments on the Report ingeneral, and their agreement in particular to the inclusion in theforthcoming Transport Bill of the legislative provisions summarised in paragraph 4. 38 of the Report.B.

SECTION 11,1 The full terms of reference for this Joint Review of therailway industry,  and the membership of the Group,   are containedin the Annex to the White Paper on Transport Policy (Cmnd.3057).In our Interim Report we said that we intended to submit this,our main report,  during the course of the summer.1.2 We have met,  in all,  nineteen times as a full Group (onemeeting extending over two days)  and a great deal of work hasbeen done by Sub-Committees and individual members,   which inparticular has involved the independent members of this Groupgiving up very many days of their time to the work of the inquiry.    As an example only,  the Sub-Group which reviewed theBoard&apos;s financial estimates met five times in nine days.1.3 We much regretted the temporary absence on sickleave of Mr.  James,  and the fact that Mr. Margetts has been illfor several months,  and has only just resumed duty.    We wereglad that Mr.  H.   C.  Johnson,  formerly Chairman and general manager of the London Midland Region,  and now a Vice Chairmanof the Board,  was able to attend in place of Mr.  Margetts andMr. W.  I.  Winchester,   Chief Officer (Financial Research),   in place of Mr.  James.1.4 The present Report covers our recommendations onthe overall financial structure of the railways,  and on the overallmanagement structure and organisation which we think most appropriate for the future.    We should make it clear that on bothissues the Group have concentrated on the matters likely torequire legislation;  a great deal of further detailed work will be involved.1-5 Section 2 of this Report sets out our financialrecommendations and is based on work by the Board and byCooper Brothers.    Our main recommendations are:-INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY
1.5.1     that the aim should be for the Board to &quot;break even&quot;by the early 1970s;1.5.2     that,   in addition to the specific grants for unremunerativepassenger services recommended in our Interim Report,there should be a specific grant,  limited in time and reducing over a period, towards the rationalisation oftrack;1.5.3     that the capital debt of the Board should be drasticallywritten down;1.5.4     that this writing down should take account of the continuing obligations of the Board in respect of suchmatters as bridges and level crossings and certainsuperannuation liabilities;1.5.5     that the value of the assets should also be writtendown;   and1.5.6     that there should no longer be provision for deficitgrants,  except on a transitional basis.1.6 Section 3 of the Report contains our recommendations onmanagement structure.    As we make clear in&apos; that Section, we hadthe benefit of a very   full submission by the Board,  and Mr.  Pears,the Senior Partner in Cooper Brothers,  gave us great assistance by interviewing each member of our Group,  and preparing a paper which summarised and collated our individual views.    Thisgreatly eased the course of our discussions,  as also did a furtherpaper by Mr.   Pears giving us the benefit of his own views.    Themain recommendations which we make are:-1.6.1.    that Section 1 of the Transport Act,  1962,  should be amended to provide for a somewhat smaller Board;1.6.2     that Section 2 of the Act,  which provides for the setting up of Regional Boards,   should be repealed;1.6.3     that provision should be made requiring the Board toput forward a general scheme of organisation for theMinister&apos;s approval within a specified period;
1.6.4that the Chairman should be given some relief bythe appointment of a &quot;Chief General Manager      whowould have responsibility for the day-to-day running of the railway;1.6.5that two senior members of the Board (who might bemade Vice Chairmen)   should be given specificresponsibilities for the broad areas of planning and finance;   and1.6.6that apart from this,  and the special responsibility ofone member for labour relations,  the other board members should be free of functional responsibilities.1.7We consulted the Trade Unions and the views they expressed on finance and management structure have been takeninto account in the recommendations in Sections 2 and 3.    Therewere a number of other matters on which the Unions commented,  andwhich seem to us worthy of mention,  and these are set out withour further comments in Appendix A.1.8 Paragraph (d)  of our terms of reference required us&quot;to assess whether and,  if so,  to what extent the cost of therailway infrastructure includes an element of &quot;standby capacity&apos;&quot;.We have therefore set out at some length in Appendix B the views,which we accept,  of a special Committee which we set up to studythis matter.    The main conclusion to which we came in the lightof the Committee&apos;s detailed investigations was that it was highlyunlikely that &quot;standby capacity&quot;  exists as a permanent element ofany foreseeable railway network.     (We are using &quot;standby capacity&quot;to mean capacity which is additional to that required  (a)  on commercial grounds,  and (b)  for the social services.     Inother words,  it is surplus capacity which is additional to thatwhich the railways need for sound commercial reasons  (e.g.  to cope with predictable peaks or to assist operational efficiency) ) .We are satisfied that as a legacy from the past there is considerable
surplus capacity,  actual and potential,   in the system.     The committee recommended,   and we agree,  that a programme of work shouldbe settled to identify this surplus,  to asses its costs,   and to workout a programme for its elimination.    We also recommend that a specific grant should be agreed,  on a diminishing basis,  with the aim of assisting,  and hastening,  the elimination of this surplus andthe rationalisation of the system .     This grant would pay for theestimated maintenance cost of the surplus,  both existing and potential,   in the system in 1969 and would reduce to zero overa period during which it should be practicable for the railwaysto rid themselves of it.    Appendix B also includes an account ofthe work now in hand to implement these recommendations.    a provisional figure for the cost of this surplus is included in the calculations and recommendations in Section 2 of this Report.1.9 Paragraph  (f)  of our terms of reference required theGroup to look at the other continuing obligations resting on the Board,A progress report on the work of the Joint Teams whom we setup to look at the various obligations was included in our InterimReport (Part IV of Annex A).    We have now reached conclusions on virtually all of these matters,  and the financial implications ofour recommendations are included in Section 2 of this Report.    Aswill be seen,  we conclude that together they amount to a sum ofapproximately  8m.  per annum,   and that the most appropriate wayof recognising this is by taking account of it in the capital reconstruction,   which we have already briefly mentioned inparagraph 1.5 above.    The results of these studies are set out at greater length in Appendix C,  which includes those of our recommendations which do not directly relate to finance.1.10 We set out in our Interim Report the recommendations which we made in respect of subsidies for unremunerative passenger services.    We now think that it is better to call these moneypayments &quot;grants&quot; ,   and we refer to them under this title henceforward
Our Interim Report (Annex A paragraphs 9 and 10)  explainedthat the Consultants were proceeding with the preparation of a form of questionnaire which the Board would use in submittingapplications for grants.    Considerable progress has been madewith this,  and the Consultants have now prepared a form ofquestionnaire which is being used on a sample of some 25unremunerative passenger services.     They have also producedinformation about the likely overall size of the grant required forthis type of service.    Appendix D records the work that has beendone since our Interim Report,  and the current position.    As we make clear in that Appendix,  we have been kept informed aboutthe progress of thinking on Passenger Transport Authorities,  andthe extent to which it is proposed that they should become financiallyresponsible for local services in conurbations.    We have concluded that the detailed implications are not matters on which we needmake recommendations.    Appendix D to this Report also includesour recommendations about the treatment of interest in the calculation of grants for unremunerative passenger services,  the treatmentof capital losses where grants are terminated,  problems resultingfrom the allocation of track costs and the problem of subventionslor bus services provided in lieu of withdrawn railway services.1.11 The Minister and the Chairman may also find it helpful to know the extent of the further work which we have in mind,and the likely timetable.     For convenience this can be set out under the six remits which we originally agreed with the consultants,  and which were reported in Annex D to our InterimReport.Remits1-12 We set up a Costing Progress Committee to review progressby the Railways in developing and implementing the recommendationsconcerning costing contained in the original report by the consultants to which we referred in our Interim Report.    ProgressQi this is being maintained by the Board,  and a small research
section has been established.    We are satisfied that there are norecommendations capable of immediate adoption which are notbeing developed.     Some recommendations will probably requirereconsideration in the light of the further report from  CooperBrothers which,  as set out under remit 4 below,  we hope toreceive by the end of July.    There are clearly a number of matters on which we shall wish to express a definite view,  butwe are unlikely to be in a position to do this before the autumn.Remit 21.13 The sample study of 25 unremunerative services to whichwe have referred in paragraph 1.10 above is now being conductedjointly by the Board and the Ministry,  in co-operation withCooper Brothers.    We hope that the results of this will beavailable in the autumn,  and propose to include the main results in a subsequent report to the Minister and the Chairman.Remit 3.11.14 Martech are undertaking a study on train load traffics,the results of which should be available shortly,  and the board are undertaking a separate exercise on wagbn-load traffics.    we hope that we shall be able to incorporate the results of these studies in a later paper.Remit 3.2 Marketing Organisation   )Remit 3 . 3 Pricing Policy ^1.15 Cooper Brothers hope to submit their initial report to usshortly to be followed by a further report in the autumn on pricing policy.Remit 4.     Review of Budgetary and Financial Control and management Information--1.16 Cooper Brothers hope to report to us by the end ofJuly,  1967,  with a further report by the end of September dealingwith procedures for the control of capital expenditure.
RemJLJ).. Procedures for Preparing Long-Term Financial Estimates1 17 We shall have to consider with the Consultants,  in thelight of the reports referred to above,  whether there is any-additional work which needs to be done under this remit.Remit 6 .  Management  Structure1,18 It is clear that some further work will be required underthis remit, and we propose to discuss this with the Consultants when their further reports are available.1,19 We shall also be making recommendations under (e)of our terms of reference which requires us to examine theBoard&apos;s investment programmes and the criteria for investmentappraisal.1.20 Accordingly we shall certainly wish to submit a further report in the autumn,   and it may be appropriate,  as circumstancesdevelop,  to put in short separate reports,  rather than a furthercomprehensive one.    We will keep in close touch with officials from the Ministry and the Board on the necessary timetable.1.21 We conclude this Section by emphasising that,  as in the interim Report,  our aim has been to provide the gist of our recommendations as shortly as possible,   and in the most readableform.    All our detailed papers,  and the reports from the consultants,   are already available both in the Ministry and inthe Board.    We have again,  therefore,   confined ourselves as faras possible to a statement of our main findings and recommendations,with the minimum of supporting material.1.22 Our conclusions and recommendations are summarised inSection 4 of this report.
SECTION 2FINANCEINTRODUCTION2,1 Paragraph 3 of the Annex to the White Paper on transport Policy (Cmnd.3057)  said that the social and other considerations which had led to the decision to stabilise therailway network also made it necessary to substitute a new financial framework for that imposed by the Transport Act,1962.    The requirement contained in that Act for the Board to&quot;pay its way&quot; by the beginning of 1968 was now entirelyunrealistic and would,  if pursued,  force it into action which inmany cases would be against the interest of the community andinconsistent with the Governments plans.    It was therefore necessary for this framework to be amended to provide more realistic and appropriate financial objectives and a new financialframework and discipline.2.2 In Section 4 of our Interim Report we said that oneof the most important tasks implicit in our terms of reference was to review the financial prospects of the Board in the lightof current developments and the new policies indiciated in theWhite Paper.2.3. Whilst it had not been possible for us at the time wesubmitted the Interim Report to assess the reduction in futuredeficits which would be brought about by direct grants of thevarious kinds we had in mind,  or by payments by other authoritiesm respect of specific loss-making passenger services,   we thoughtit clear that there would still be  a gap - possibly a large one -between the total of the Board&apos;s revenue,  including these variousgrants,  and their total costs.2*4 We explained in our Interim Report that we had setourselves the aim of viewing the whole of the Board&apos;s business as it would be in future years in the light of the Government&apos;s
policies,taking account of future increases in efficiency,  including those which should result from our current review.    We havenow completed an exercise on these lines,   and can thereforemake recommendations as to how the objectives set out in theWhite Paper can best be achieved.    We have only just seen thevery recent report by McKinsey &amp; Co.  on &quot;Containerisation&quot;which they prepared for the British Transport Docks Board butit is clear that the developments which they foresee could be ofgreat importance for the railways.2.5 We have looked in great detail at the problems involved in paying grants for unremunerative passenger services,and include some details of our work in Appendix D.    It will beimpossible to put forward a firm figure for the total of thesegrants until a great deal more work has been done,  but we haveagreed a tentative estimate,   (paragraph 2.16).    We are also ina position,   as a result of the work described in Appendix B,  toput forward a rough order of magnitude figure for the grant thatwe recommend in respect of track rationalisation (paragraph 2.23),We explained in our Interim Report that a number of Joint Teamshad been set up to look  at the various continuing obligations onthe Board to which specific reference was made in paragraph (f)of our terms of reference,   and we have now been able  (paragraph2.18)  to put an approximate figure to the cost of these obligations.But as we indicated in January,  we have come to realise that thereis no possibility that these subventions could suffice to take theBritish Railways Board out of its current deficit position.REVIEW OF LONG TERM REVENUE  FORECASTS2.6 We therefore thought it right to  ask the Board toproduce detailed financial forecasts for 1969  and 1974 in orderthat we could look at the whole financial position as it was likelyto be on the best assumptions that could be made.    The Board
discussed and agreed with the Ministry of Transport,  and other government Departments,  the economic assumptions on whichthis study should be carried out,   and these are set out inAppendix E.l.    The Board produced detailed forecasts for both these years,  comparing likely levels of revenue and costs,  butignoring interest,   and their detailed tabulations are set out inAppendix E.2.    These forecasts showed that in the Board&apos;view, on the basis of the assumptions to which we have already referred,   and assuming a continuance of present asset valuesand depreciation policy,  they would reach a position of being in deficit to the extent of about  30m.  on operating account in 1969,and would be likely to break even on operating account in 1974.But, as we make clear in later paragraphs,  they would not beearning sufficient,  even taking all the various types of grantinto account,  to pay interest on the whole of the existing capitaldebt.2.7 These forecasts have been examined in some detail by a Finance Sub-Group.    Whilst Board representatives attendedall the meetings of the Sub-Group   and gave such information and assistance as was required,  it was agreed that they should notbe regarded as members.2.8 It is clear from this work that looking ahead as far as1974 involves a considerable degree of judgement,   and evenspeculation.    The Sub-Group therefore concentrated their attention on those aspects of the forecasts where the overalloutcome appeared to be particularly sensitive to variations inthe basic assumptions used.    On the cost side,  the most importantassumptions made by the Board concerned operating performance,the wages level,  and the extent to which it would in practice prove possible to run down their manpower.    Other key assumptionsconcerned the national economic environment,   and thus demandfor rail services and the prices which it would be possible forthe Board to charge.    The Sub-Group also thought it necessary
to make a provisional examination of the level of investment implied by these forecasts,   as it is obviously extremely relevant to remeberthat the Board&apos;s forecasts depend upon the assumption thatinvestment will be available at the rate of about  100m.  per annum.2.9 The Sub-Group were also particularly concerned aboutthe possible effects of inflation.    As will be clear from Appendix El,the Board worked on an agreed assumption that there would be noinflation,   and that wages would rise at a rate of 3 per-cent perannum.    This is in line with the assumptions used for currentGovernment planning.    But the railways might be seriously affectedif,  in the event there was some degree of inflation,   (particularly if their costs were inflated more than those of their competitors or the economy as a whole)   and whilst it is not yet possible for us to putforward detailed figures we are arranging for further work to bedone on this over the next few months.2.10 Our views on the Board&apos;s figures can be summarised asfollows  : -2.10.1      While the Board have given us every possible help,and answered all our questions as fully as possiblein the time available,  many of the most importantforecasts are still subject to refinement as a resultof further work which the Board are putting inhand,  but which cannot be completed before theautumn.2.10.2     Subject to this qualification,   we feel that in general there may be more optimism than pessimism in the forecasts.     The following factors need to be takeninto account in putting forward a possible bracketof results  : -2.10.2.1      The reservations regarding investment and inflation made above.
2.10.2.2     The forecasts assume that there will bea steady expansion in the economy at about 3 per-cent a year;   slower growthor fluctuation could damage the railways.2.10.2.3     The use of 1966  as a base may itselfapply a degree of optimism;   the 1967results may now be some  10m.  worse than those of 1966 .     It is unlikely inthese circumstances that 1969 could show the improvement indicated in the forecast,despite the increases in charges whichthe Board have proposed to the Minister.2.10.2.4     Postulated improvements in locomotive andcrew utilisation,   and in wagon working,might prove slower and more difficult torealise;  this would worsen the results by several  millions.2.10.2.5     It may prove difficult, even with the specialhelp which will certainly be necessary, toreduce manpower at the rate implied in the forecast.2.10.2.6     There must be a danger of some traffics,particularly coal, falling short of expectations;on the other hand there is probably scope for increasing receipts through highercharges.2.10.2.7     freight liners are still at such an early stage of their development that estimates as far ahead as 1974 must be regarded as somewhatspeculative.Whilst different members may attribute different weights to these various factors they are agreed on the broad conclusions set out&apos;n the next paragraph.
2.11 Drawing these various threads together,  and making areasonable allowance for the factors which might occur in combination,  we have reached the conclusion that, unless there aremajor changes in policies,  the bottom end of the bracket of likely-results in 1974 might well be up to  40m.  worse than forecast,before taking any account of interest.    On the other hand,  the topend of the bracket seems unlikely to be more than  10m. better.Both these figures take no account of the various subventions fromthe Government which we recommend should be available.    It shouldbe noted that the range of  50m.  suggested above is equivalent toabout 5 per-cent of the combined revenue and expenses of theundertaking,   and this is looking seven years ahead;   thus,  while wethink these figures are sensible for planning purposes it is not impossible that the results might fall right outside this range.2.12 The range quoted in the previous paragraph is given simplyin order to provide a guide to the Minister and the Chairman when considering the question of the extent to which capital reconstructionwill be required.    In our collective judgement,  the most likely outcomeon present trends and policies may well be somewhat more unfavourablthan the Board predict in the figures quoted in Appendix E2.    But wedo not wish to give the impression that nothing better than this ispossible,   and certainly it would be entirely wrong for the Board to feel that it would be satisfactory if they do no better than achieve themean point of the figures quoted above.    They have said that they hope to do better,   and should set themselves the target of doing so,provided the trend of the economy and other matters outside their control work out as favourably as has been assumed for the purposeof these forecasts.EFFECT OF GRANTS2.13 Before considering the degree of recapitalisation that maybe desirable,  we have had to consider the nature and scale of thevarious types of grant that may be available to the Board  : -
Social Grants for Unremunerative Passenger services ,14 We explain in Appendix D to this Report the progressthat has been made since our Interim Report,  and the stage thatwe have reached.    It will not be possible to put forward anything like an accurate total for these grants until at least a considerablenumber of services have been looked at in great detail.    In themeantime,  we asked Cooper Brothers,  in association with theBoard&apos;s officers,  to make the best estimate they could of the likelyorder of magnitude for the total of these grants.    In view of thetime available for the preparation of the estimate it was necessaryto use information on the earnings and direct costs of services which was already available.    Much of this was somewhat out of date and had to be adjusted to take account of changes in price levels and fairly broad assumptions had to be made about trackand signalling costs.    On this basis, the Consultants said thatthe total deficit on all loss-making passenger services was 83m. p. a.But to make the figure compatible with thosequoted in Appendix E2 it is necessary toexcludeServices on &quot;grey&quot; or &quot; thin black&quot; lines which it was assumed would be withdrawnby 1969  14m.Interest related to the remaining services      17m.      31m._On this basis the adjusted deficit is  52m.  p. a.2.15 A broad analysis is  :-London Suburban  10m.Other Suburban   8m.Stopping  21m.Principal and Secondary  13m.Total  52m. p. a.
2.16 It is likely that certain of the services which areincluded in the above figures would not in fact be submitted for grant by the Board,  either because they considered that theservices could be made viable by management action or becausethey wished to retain them for sound commercial reasons.    Itis also clear that if there were to be a somewhat greater degreeof aggregation of services,  the total deficit quoted would be smaller,  because the surplus on other services would counter-balance the loss on the services included above.  On the otherhand it may be that on investigation it will prove right further to sub-divide some of the services with a consequent increase inthe losses ranking for grant.    The net effect of these qualificationsis likely to be a reduction in claims,  particularly for LondonSuburban and principal and secondary services:  in relation to thelatter the case for a grant on social grounds might often not be strong.    After taking all these points into account,  the Boardestimate that the total grants  (excluding interest)  which they mightactually expect to receive in 1969  and 1974 will not exceed thefigures of  40m.   and  35m.    These may prove to be over-estimatesif efficiency can be improved,  or the services pruned,  more thannow seems likely;  or as a result of applications for grant beingrejected,  in which case the services in question would presumablybe withdrawn.    In these circumstances the Board !s basic figures would be similarly affected and the net result would be the same.The Board&apos;s Continuing Obligations Deriving from the Past2.17 We have described in some detail in Appendix C the work that has been done on these continuing obligations by the variousJoint Teams whom    we set up at the time of our appointment.    Weare agreed that there is no need for specific financial treatment inrespect of Museums and Historical Records,  where we hope thatthe Board&apos;s responsibilities can largely be handed over to theDepartment of Education and Science.    As regards the Savings^Bas!
there is no short-term problem,  but the interest on thesedeposits,   and also on the Superannuation funds,  has to betaken into account when we   come to assess the total amountof interest burden which it would be    appropriate for the board to carry for the future.2.18 The specific obligations which should be mentioned at this stage are  : -2.18.1      Road Bridges,  a sum of about  l^m. per annum.2.18.2     Level Crossings,  a sum of about  lm.per annum.2.18.3     The British Transport Police  (in respect oftheir services to the public as a whole)  say f-m . per annum      and2.18.4      The Board&apos;s Superannuation obligations resultingfrom the decisions of their predecessors -  about 5m.  per annum.2.19 We considered whether it would be appropriate tomeet these obligations by some kind of specific or general grant.There would,  however,  be considerable practical difficulties involved in arranging for such grants,   and agreeing the amounts.The general nature of the grants would moreover be quite different from the type of specific grant which we are recommendingin respect of unremunerative passenger services.    We have therefore come to the conclusion that the sensible way in which to deal with these relatively small sums is to take account ofthem in the recapitalisation which we discuss later in this  Section.Xpack Rationalisation2.20 Paragraph (d)   of our terms of reference required usto assess  &quot;whether and if so to what extent the cost of railway&quot;if restructure includes an element of &quot;standby capacity&quot;&quot;.    We have
in fact made intensive enquiries into the remifications of thissubject,   and a brief summary of our work is included inAppendix 33.     We have concluded that,   strictly speaking,&quot;Standby capacity&quot; other than that required by the railway for commercial reasons or for operational convenience,  does not exist as  a permanent feature,  but there is a considerable measureof surplus capacity,   actual or potential,   in the system,  the costof which is bound to swell the Board&apos;s deficit until it can be eliminated.     This surplus is not mainly related to the route mileagof the system or to the decision to retain and develop a basicnetwork of 11,000 route miles.    It is almost wholly to be foundin the shape of excess track mileage  (e.g.  four tracks,  where two would suffice to carry the traffic) .     This is one of theinherited liabilities of the railway which,  in the light of the policies which we recommend for the future,   should be eliminated as quickly as possible.     The amount of the surplus is not static and additional surplus should be continuously created with changes inequipment and operational methods.     For the purpose of settlingthis grant,  however,   it is proposed to confine consideration tosurplus which exists now or can be created before 1974.    we hope that it will be possible for the Board to identify and costall this surplus capacity within the next 18 months.    But theyhave explained that,  even so,  there are good technical reasons why much of this surplus cannot be eliminated as soon as it isidentified.     In many cases it will involve alterations to alternativeroutes,  the rationalisation of services,  the installation of improvedsignalling and possibly even the removal of old stations or thebuilding of new ones.    Where these steps are necessary theymay well take a number of years.    But,  until they can becarried out,  the Board will have to carry the cost of this surplus
-19 -137We are therefore satisfied that there is a case,  exceptionally,(or the Ministry paying a specific grant whose purpose shouldbe to assist,   and hasten,  the elimination of this surplus andthe rationalisation of the system.     Whether this grant shouldalso cover any part of the capital cost of removing the surplushas still to be considered.2.21 We have already explained why the other historicliabilities under which the Board suffer can most conveniently be dealt with by means of a capital reconstruction.    The factthat this infrastructure surplus is a liability which can be substantially reduced over a period of a few years means that,from the finance angle,  the appropriate treatment is a specificbut tapering subsidy,   rather than capital reconstruction.    Weare therefore recommending that the Board should be paid,in the first year,  a grant which should meet the assessed costof this surplus,  but that the grant should thereafter be reducedat an agreed rate,  so that it reaches zero at the earliestperiod by which the Board could be expected to have removedat least the greater part of this surplus.    We suggest that thisperiod should be fixed at 5 years.2.22 We think we should emphasise that in recommendingsuch a grant,  we regard it essentially as a tool for securingthe most rapid possible rationalisation of the system.    Althoughthe Board gets no benefit from the retention of uncessarycapacity,  we think they would be helped by an incentive to get rid of ft rapidly.    If a grant is agreed on the lines we propose,!t should represent a challenge to the Board to deal with the
situation as drastically and as rapidly as circumstances and theavailable resources permit.2.23 As set out in Appendix B,  the Board will not beable to put forward a precise figure for the cost of this surpluuntil towards the end of 1968.     In the meantime,  they have produced an order of magnitude figure which,  for the year 196is a bracket from  11m.  to  17m.     They believe,   and we accept,  that this may represent something of an underestimate,and we suggest that for the current overall financial exercisewe should assume that the grant in 1969 will be at a rate of 15m.  per annum.     If this is  accepted,  then it is fair to assumthat by 1974 rationalisation will have reduced their costs bysomething near to this amount  (even although the grant will nolonger be payable) ,    and we have therefore assumed a  15m,improvement in their finance for both years.Subventions to Operators of Bus Services, provided as  a Condition of the Withdrawal of Rail services .24 We said in our Interim Report (paragraph 3.23) thiwe would have to consider how to deal with these subventionswhich,  in 1966,   actually cost the Board  500,000 - less thanthe total losses because some operators,   and particularly theTransport Holding Company Groups,  claim less than they migtThis figure will certainly increase,   at least in the short term,We are still unable to make specific recommendations  as to hoithis financial responsibility can best be removed from the Boaras  any new arrangements should fit in with the general structuof the policies for the bus industry generally which are currentl
being developed within the Ministry.    But we are agreed that,as part of the overall financial reconstruction which we arerecommending,  the Board should be released from theseburdens,   and we assume in the following paragraphs that away will be found to achieve this.THE BOARD&apos; S FUTURE  FINANCIAL STRUCTUREout in their 1966 Annual Report and Accounts,  is as   follows: -Interest-Bearing Capital Liabilities2.25The Board&apos;s current interest-bearing debt,   as set to Minister of Transport 912m.Savings Bank Deposits  36m.Superannuation,  etcDeposits and provisions 275m . 1, 223m.In addition, the suspended debt (on which no interest is payable)  totalled ----- 705m.but the capital deficit arising from adjustment of book values of vested net assets could be offset against this - -- --  -- --  -- - 315m.leaving a total of 390m.2.26 The following table sets out the likely figures for theBoard&apos;s financial position in 1969 and 1974 including the effectof the proposed grants.

2,27 These figures demonstrate that,   if the government policy set out in the White Paper is to be carried into effect,a considerable write-off of existing capital debt to the minister is inevitable.    The White Paper said that after the Governmenthad assumed responsibility for losses on services retained for social reasons,  the Board should then be given realistic financial objectives to assist them to move as soon as possible to a fullyeconomic basis of operation.    Even on the most optimisticassumptions,  the Board cannot be expected to do this on thebasis of their present debit.2.28 We are agreed that recapitalisation must be on a realistic basis,   and must not look too far ahead to a period wherethe uncertainties become great.  We recommend therefore that thecapital reconstruction should be carried out on a basis which doesnot foresee quite such a rate of recovery as is suggested by theBoard &apos;s revenue forecasts, and that the aim should be to put theBoard in a position of break even,  including interest payments,  inthe early 1970s.2.29 We regard it as obvious that the Board must be put ina position where they can continue to honour their obligations inrespect of the interest-bearing deposits and provisions for the savings Banks and Superannuation and Retirement Funds,  etc.Any recapitalisation which is considered can relate only to theBoard&apos;s debt to the Minister.2.30 Subject to the figures which the Board produce later in the year not being drastically different,  we see no reason why itshould not be possible to put the Board in a break even position byabout 1971.    Whilst this would certainly involve a drastic writing down of their capital debt we do not believe that this need go beyong thebounds of acceptability.    Transitional deficit grant powers may wellbe needed to cover the period from 1969 to 1971,  but it is an important
part of the scheme which we recommend that no future deficitgrant powers need be envisaged for the period after 1971. In other words,  we think it essential that the Board should be put in a break even position at an early date,  and that they should then beseen to be in a similar position to other nationalised industries,with no need for the Minister to have powers to make grants tomeet any deficit that they might incur in an individual year.2.31 It is considered that the capital reconstruction envisagedshould be matched by an equivalent writing down of asset values.Such a writing down would have the consequence of reducing theamount of depreciation which the Board would have to provide eachyear,  and would thus increase the margin of revenue it hadavailable for servicing capital debt.    In working out the detailed figures,  however,  consideration should be given to shortening the depreciation lives of certain assets, for instance,because of the riskof technical  and commercial obsolescence.2.32 If in any year the Board did in fact fail to earn enoughto meet all their liabilities,  including interest,  the main effect wouldbe that they would not have earned their depreciation in full.Depreciation (including amortisation) is a provision in respect ofthe consumption of fixed assets which involves no cash expenditureyear by year.    The expenditure arises only when the assets haveto be replaced.    Nonetheless, under the present system, exchequer grant is issued in respect of the depreciation provision,   and theBoard are provided with cash in excess of that needed to meetoperating losses;  this cash is available towards their current capital requirements.    Under our proposed scheme,  the Board would nolonger have the cash from depreciation unless they actually earnedit.    They would have to borrow the sum required to make up anydeficiency.     But given the estimates which the Board and the Ministrmake of the position up to 1974,   and on the basis of the degree of
recapitalisation which we have in mind,  this situation should not present an intolerable burden.    We do not think that even overthe following few years,  it need become unmanageable,  though we recognise that there will be a need for a continuing financialimprovement after 1974 if investment is to be sustained at itspresent level.2.33 There are two further comments which we shouldmake : -2.33.1     We are recommending a very drastic approach tothe problem.    A possible consequence might be that more capital is written off than proves to have been necessary.    If this should prove to be so,  the board might well earn a considerable surplus.    But Section18 of the 1962 Act already provides for the establishmentof a general reserve as a charge on revenue, underthe Minister&apos;s control.    In addition the Minister will,we suggest,  need a power,  on the analogy of thatcontained in Section 3(9)  of the Air Corporations Act,1966, providing for the capital reconstruction of BOAC,to direct,  after consultation with the Board,  that any amount surplus to the Board&apos;s requirements should bepaid into the Exchequer.2.33.2    We believe that to put the Board&apos;s financial structure ona break-even basis,  and to remove the &quot;safety-net&quot; ofa deficit grant power,  should re-inforce the Board&apos;internal financial discipline.2.34 We do not think that it would be right for us to recommendprecisely how much the write-off should be.    We have,   as yet,  onlyfairly rough figures available,   and the precise figures forrecapitalisation will need to be determi ned over the next few monthsln the light of the position that will emerge as the Board&apos;s own
financial forecasts are further refined and,  it is hoped,  theeconomic outlook becomes clearer.    Certainly there will bea need for the figures to be discussed in detail between theBoard,  the Ministry and the Treasury.    But,  clearly,  theMinister and the Chairman would expect us to recommend theprinciples which any recapitalisation should follow.2.35 As an indication of orders of magnitude,  however,we might make the following points  : -2.35.1     If the remaining suspended debt were written off,and asset values written down accordingly, the depreciation allowances to be provided in the Board&apos;saccounts could be reduced by some  15m.  -  20m.There would be no immediate effect on the interestburden.2.35.2    If,  say,  100m.  of the &quot;live&quot; capital debt to the minister were written off,   and asset values were written downcorrespondingly,  the interest burden would be reducedby  6m. per annum and the depreciation provisionscould be reduced by  5m.  per annum.2.36 Recapitalisation on the scale required to meet therecommendations summarised in paragraph 2.42 is recognised asa matter of real gravity,  and represents the acceptance (which isessential)  of the fact that British Railways&apos;  earnings simply arenot sufficient to support the total assets now employed in the busineeven when allowance is made for specific social,  etc.,  grants,is thus a step in line with the aims set out in the White Paper ofproviding British Railways with realistic burdens and assets andwill enable their efficiency to be judged by normal financial criteria
2,37 Nevertheless it is also recognised that recapitalisationis merely an accounting device to align the book value of british railways&apos;  existing   assets with British Railways&apos;  earnings andof itself does nothing to render British Railways more commerciallyviable in the future when assets will be replaced   at the full costof such assets at that, time.    The recapitalisation is howeverrecommended in the expectation that it will help British Railways&apos;management to solve the basic problem of aligning the actual valueof British Railways&apos;  future assets with future earnings,  that is,ensure that the quantity and type of assets that are actually replacedin the future are only such as can be supported by future earnings.2,38 Moreover it is not envisaged that the recapitalisation will involve a relaxation of financial discipline;   on the contrary it should enable it to be exercised more clearly and thus impose on british railways a very considerable responsibility.     In the opinion ofBritish Railways this responsibility is made all the more seriousbecause of the fact that their capitalisation is wholly on the basisfixed interest.I&apos;39 The whole of this section is based on our assumptionhat, apart from the unremunerative services to be grant aidedsocial grounds,  the Railways Board will have freedom tolinage their activities on a commercial basis.-40 One member of the Steering Group feels strongly thatie present method of financing the nationalised industries by fixediterest capital is wrong,   at least as regards the railways,  andJat the introduction of an &quot;equity&quot; would be particularly suitabletithe circumstances of that industry.     Since,  however,  we haveeen informed that the Government would be most unlikely to;0cept this,  we have not pursued the matter further.
Treasury Representatives&apos;  Position2.41 The Treasury has been represented on the JointSteering Group and has therefore taken part in formulatingthe figures and arguments incorporated in the report.    these have of course been prepared in the context of railwayoperations  and prospects.     It will therefore be clear that anywider view covering other aspects,  which the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer might subsequently wish to take is in no way-prejudiced by such participation.recommendations.42 In the light of all these considerations we make thefollowing recommendations  :-2.42.1     the capital debt of the Board should be written downto a level at which it can reasonably be expectedthat the interest payments can be found out ofprospective revenue early in the 1970s;2.42.2    the &quot;break even&quot; thus envisaged should be based onneither too optimistic nor too pessimistic a forecast of the Board&apos;s revenues in the early 1970s;2.42.3    the capital write-off involved would in part bejustified by taking account of the continuing obligations of the Board in respect of railway road bridges,level crossings,  superannuation,   and the Police, as described in paragraph 2.18;2.42.4    the   capital reconstruction envisaged should be matchelby an equivalent writing down of asset values.2.42.5    appropriate arrangements should be made for dealingwith any surplus on revenue account in case, as aresult of following the previous recommendations forcutting down the capital debt,  the amount of write-offnecessary has been overestimated;
2.42.6    there should no longer be provision for deficitgrants from the Minister (except perhaps forthe transitional period 1969 to 1971):  and inparticular,  no deficit grant should be payable in respect of depreciation provision.
- 31 - SECTION board STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATIONPart present POSITION3.1 Section 1(3)  of the Transport Act 1962 provides that the board shall consist of a Chairman,  one or two Vice Chairmen,  and notmore than sixteen nor less than ten other Members.     It also providesthat Board Members are to be appointed by the Minister from amongpersons who have had wide experience of,   and who have showncapacity in,  transport,   industrial,   commercial,  or financial matters,administration,  applied science,  or the organisation of workers.At present,  there are a Chairman,  two Vice Chairmen,   sevenfull-time Members and four part-time Members.     All the full-time members,   other than the Chairman and the newly appointedVice Chairman,   have functional responsibilities.3.2 Section 2 of,   and the  First Schedule to,  the 1962 Actprovide for the setting up of 6  Regional Railway Boards to sharebetween them responsibility for all parts of the national railway system.     Subsection 2(2)  gives the Minister power,  by order,  to vary the number of Boards.     Subsection 2(4)  provides that the regional Railway Boards shall exercise such functions of theRailways Board as are delegated to them by the Board,   and theBoard have to determine these functions on lines settled from timeto time with the approval of the Minister.     At the present time,  asa result of an order made by the Minister in 1966,  there are only Regional Railway Boards.Part IIMETHOD OF WORK BY THE GROUP3.3 We have had the benefit of a submission by the railways board in which the Board&apos;s own proposals for the future structure2nd organisation of the railways are set out.    The Board summarisetheir proposals as follows:-
3.3.1       In the forthcoming Bill,   provision should be madefor a Board consisting of a Chairman, not morethan three Vice Chairmen,   and not less than tenand not more than fourteen other members.Initially they would envisage two Vice Chairmen,one inward looking,  maintaining an    efficiencyaudit upon the working of the railway in both itsoperating and its technical aspects;  the other,outward looking,   dealing with commercial policy at the highest level,  over-seeing of finance and investment budgets,  representation of the Boardon important national bodies,   and the generalconcept of business planning.     There would beat least seven full-time members in addition tothe Chairman and Vice  Chairmen,   and all of these would have functional responsibilities.3.3.2      The statutory provisions for Regional Boards setout above should be abolished.3.3.3      The Board should be required within 18 monthsof the passing of the Act to prepare and submit to the Minister a &quot;general scheme of organisation&quot;for the undertaking.3.3.4      The Minister would have power to approve thescheme,  and any subsequent modifications ofthe scheme which might be submitted by theBoard.3.4 We were fortunate in obtaining the services of Mr.   Pears,who is the  Senior Partner in Cooper Brothers and Company,who  (in order to avoid difficult and time consuming discussions of our personal views and preferences in open session)  undertook to interview separately each of the members of the Group andcollated these views in a report to the Group.    Mr.   Pears alsosaw the Chairman of the Board.     In addition to the collation of the
Group&apos;s individual views,  Mr.   Pears provided a separate papergiving an indication of his own views which he had formed in thecourse of this assignment.3.5 The Group received a separate report from  CooperBrothers which included recommendations which were based onthe experience of the Cooper Brothers&apos;   Team extending over thewhole of the railways organisation since the beginning of theirappointment as Consultants to the Group.     Cooper Brothers hadnot, however,  discussed their recommendations with theBritish Railways Board in advance,  and we have not subsequently been able to have a discussion with them.    We have,  therefore,only taken account of their recommendations in so far as this seemed appropriate in the light of other evidence.3.6 The Group have considered carefully all the views whichhave been put forward to them in these several reports and our conclusions are set out in the following paragraphs.&apos;Part iii the PROPOSED FUTURE STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATIONFactors Affecting Overall Structure and organisation.7 The British Railways Board control a complex ofmany businesses.     As in any business it is essential,   if profitabilityis to be ensured,  to match production and sales,  but the transport industry has the characteristic that transport cannot be stored.     Itis also vital to plan railway services in   such a way as to maximiseutilisation of all the assets,   including manpower.     In many cases,this involves decisions about the allocation of resources,   whenthe priorities between different types of service have to be assessed.Furthermore,  all such decisions depend,   in the long run,  onadequate co-ordinated long range planning.     It follows therefore that general management is required at the centre to ensure that allforward planning activities are properly co-ordinated and carried outw&apos;thin the framework of agreed objectives and overall strategies.
3.8 On the other hand there is a need for dispersedmanagement.   Both the scale of railway operations,   and the geographical dispersion of the system require local managementswith authority to make decisions on day to day matters.     Thislocal management must operate within general policy lines laiddown by general management at the centre.3.9 The future management structure requirements of therailways will clearly be influenced by a number of factors whichhave already become evident but which are likely to become more marked in the future.     The most important of these are:-3.9.1       the  continuing rationalisation of the  system by the elimination of facilities  (track,  marshalling yards,terminals) which are no longer required;3.9.2      the more intensive use of the developed system;3.9.3      the continuing reduction in the labour force;3.9.4      the trend towards a more ordered pattern of operationboth for passenger and freight services.These will make it even more vital to develop sophisticated planning and control techniques,   including the use of computers,   both for day to day control and for model building.3.10 All these considerations suggest an increasing trend towards the centralisation of the planning of railway operations with at least the main trunk services,  passenger and freight,  being directed from the centre.     This will also be required if the board are to develop their relationships with the new National and RegionalTransport Organisations which are to be set up.     Strong centralfinancial control will also be required if the Board are to achieve the financial targets which we have recommended inSection 2 of this Report.     These financial objectives will makeit even more important for the Board to ensure that there arecomprehensive plans,   covering each main section of their business,for the achievement of these objectives.
3,11 At present,   the Board&apos;s Headquarters is organised intofunctional departments headed by Chief Officers who in turn reportto Board members.     As indicated above,   all the full-time board members,   except for the Chairman,   and one Vice Chairman havefunctional responsibilities.     It is the consensus of opinion amongstus that full-time members should be without the direct executiveline responsibility that they have under the present arrangements.3.12 Relations between the Board and the Regions may have beencomplicated by the Regions having a statutory status under the1962 Act,   and by the philosophy of that Act being that the Regionswere to have the main responsibility for the &quot;management of therailways&quot; .    We doubt whether a split statutory responsibility forthe management of the railways,  and the present independentstatutory position of the General Managers,   can be conductive to ideal relations between the Board and the Regions.Scope of our recommendations.13 Railway problems are unique,  both because of the size and geographical spread of the industry and the nature of its operations and commercial activities.    Many of us are without direct experienceof the industry and can only base our opinions on acquaintanceshipwith its problems and the limited study that has been possible overthe last year.    We are also conscious that the setting up of theNational Freight Organisation,  and a number of Passenger transport authorities,  will obviously influence the shape of management structure appropriate for the Railways Board.     Furthermore,  wehave pointed out that there are a number of developments whichare leading to a greater element of central direction.    We couldnot, therefore,   claim to be in a position to make specific recommendations about all the details that will be involved in the new organisation.    But we feel confident in putting forward some general principles which should be observed in any new organisationalstructure .
Timescale3.14 We think it best to frame our recommendations in thelight of the ultimate shape and structure for the industry which wethink will be appropriate in a few years time when the &quot;new railway&quot;is in existence.    We are,   in the following paragraphs,   recommending a different type of Board designed to meet the situation thenlikely to exist,  and this will affect the overall structure and geographical organisation of the railways.     It may well be that none of the changes which we propose can be implemented quickly.We accordingly emphasise that there will be a need for a transitional period during which these changes can be effected.    We accept that the determination of the precise provisional arrangements which will operate during this transitional period must be forthe Ministry and the Board.    These arrangements will have totake account of the inevitable practical and human problems involved.We do not think that it would be appropriate for us,   in thisReport,  to attempt to deal with these transitional problems.    we recognise that they will be difficult,  but we are concentrating on what we believe should be the ultimate objectives.Proposals for the New board.15 In our view,  the Board should as far as possible be free to concentrate on policy questions and in particular on theproblems of future planning,   and the individual members shouldnot be tied down by day to day responsibilities for specific functions.We are therefore generally agreed that it would be sensible thatultimately the Board should consist largely of non-functional members and should be smaller than at present.Top Management and Responsibility for Co-ordinationThe Chairman3.16 We accept the view put forward by the Board that theChairman must be given some relief from his present heavy load of day-to-day responsibility.    He inevitably has many commitments
of a more general nature,   and it is therefore desirable that he shouldbe free from day-to-day matters as much as possible in order tobe able to concentrate on the major issues of policy and to projectthe Board&apos;s image both within the organisation and to the public at large.3.17 Clearly it is the Board itself which will carry theultimate responsibility for policy and direction of the railways andfor the overall performance of the undertaking.    But the Chairmanhas a particular responsibility for these matters,   not least in hisrelations with the Minister and with Parliament.    All the Membersof the Board,   including those with executive responsibilities towhom we refer in paragraphs 3.19   to    3.29 inclusive and 3.31below,  will regard themselves as responsible to the Board as awhole.3.18 We consider that the Chairman must have time to devoteto top level management planning problems.    No doubt,  a chief officer would be responsible for the major personnel planningissues,   and we think that,   exceptionally,   such a Chief Officer should report direct to the Chairman on questions of management development.Need for a &quot;Chief General Manager&quot; for the Railways as a Whole3.19 If the Chairman is to be relieved of his day-to-dayresponsibilities,  and the Board is to be reconstituted as we suggestabove,  the great majority of us are of the view that it will ultimately be desirable to have a single person to control andco-ordinate all aspects of the day-to-day running of the railway.Whilst we do not wish to assign a specific title to such a person,we envisage him as a kind of Chief General Manager,  responsible forthe railway as a whole,   and for convenience we refer to such aperson below under this title.3.20 We envisage that the Chief General Manager wouldProvide leadership and direction to the Regions and/or Divisions,  andwould be the focus of the Board&apos;s headquarter functional organisation
insofar as it is concerned with current policy making and theefficiency of the business.    He would be in a position to providethe necessary degrees of co-ordination between commercial,  operatingand technical requirements in respect both of passenger and freight traffic.3.21 The burden on one man would necessarily be extremelyheavy.     But the great majority of us are agreed that,  under whatevertitle,  there must be one man whose responsibility it is to take theultimate decisions on day-to-day matters - or see that they are taken,   and are duly implemented.     The emphasis should be onhis responsibility for the effectiveness of the organisation,  ratherthan on his taking personal decisions.    Many of us do not thinkthat the Board&apos;s original proposal that this duty -could be splitbetween two Vice Chairmen would solve the problem,  as itwould tend to mean that,   in practice,   difficulties would have to be resolved by the Chairman.    We therefore recommend that thereshould be a single Chief General Manager,   recognising that hewill need a considerable staff in support to whom he will delegateon a substantial scale.3.22 The Chief General Manager must have a position of sufficient status and authority within the Board,  and publicly,  toenable him to do this job.     Clearly he must be a member of theBoard,  and it might well be the case that it would normally be appropriate for him to be appointed as a Deputy or Vice Chairman.But we recognise that circumstances and personalities change fromtime to time,   and we do not think that the legislative provisions for the Board need define his status on the Board.Planning and Finance3.23 These are two areas which are so important,  and whichwill have so pervasive an effect on the work of the Railways board as a whole,  that we recommend that it will be essential to appointmembers to the Board with specific responsibilities for these twoaspects of the Board&apos;s work.
3.24 We recommend that one member should be responsible(or the co-ordination of long range planning in the railways.    Wesuggest that he must have specific responsibility for.24.1     ensuring that there are coherent,   comprehensive andcompatible objectives,   strategies and long range plans for each main sector of the business,  directed towardsthe achievement of the overall financial objectives ofthe undertaking;3.24.2    establishing a systematic organisational and proceduralframework in which all planning activities should becarried out and the results monitored;  and3.24.3    co-ordinating all the long range planning activities in the railways wherever carried out.3.25 It would be necessary for this member to be supported bya corporate planning department consisting of people with varyingknowledge and experience.3.26 He could also be directly responsible for managementorganisation planning and probably for an economic and commercialstudies department which would include market research.     Possiblyhe could also include technical research and development within hissphere of interest.3.27 We also recommend that there should be a member appointed with specific responsibility for finance.     He would have a special responsibility for.27.1     the overall financial policy of the undertaking;3.27.2    the operation of the financial control system;   and3.27.3    the development of management information and controlsystems.We should however comment that we are due to receive a reportfrom Cooper Brothers on their review of budgetary and financial control and management information by the end of July,   and we may wish to review the responsibility for the development of these systems&apos;n the light of that report.
3 . 28 In view of the great importance for finance of purchasingand supplies in the special circumstances of the railways,  we suggestthat the finance member might also be responsible for these activities and it would also be appropriate to consider,  in the light of circumstances at the time,   whether he might also have an overallresponsibility for estates.3 . 29 It will be essential that both the planning and financemembers should have positions of recognised status and responsibility on the Board,  to which,  of course,  as a whole,  they would both beresponsible.    We suggest that the legislative provision for theBoard should be such that it would be open to the Minister,   inconsultation with the Chairman,  to appoint both of these asVice Chairmen of the Board if,   in particular cases,  this seemedappropriate.    This might most conveniently be achieved,  by analogywith the Iron and Steel Act,  1967,  by giving the Minister powerto appoint one or more members of the Board as Deputy orVice-Chairman.Full-Time Members3 .30 In addition there must clearly be a number of full-time board members.     With the sole exception of a member who,   we recommend,should have functional responsibilities for personnel and labour relations  (paragraph 3.31)  we are agreed that these Board members should not have functional duties.    Tney should have spheres ofinterest,   and might often be required to co-ordinate activities ofvarious kinds.    By this,  we mean that individual members mightbe given responsibility for such varying matters as the overalldevelopment of the passenger business  (necessarily crossing manyfunctional boundaries) ,   relations with the various passenger transport Authorities,  the general oversight of one or moreRegions,  or non-executive Chairmanship of  (or general responsibilityfor)  one or more of the subsidiary units to which we refer inparagraph 3.42 below.    The functional head of each of the various
departments should be the Chief Officer,   reporting to the Board asa whole,   (most of them through the Chief General Manager,)  andnot, as now,  to a functional member of the Board.Labour Relations3.31 In view of the undoubted importance of personnel andlabour relations,   we think that there should be a Board member who should have specific responsibility for the longer term developmentof labour relations in the industry.    The Chief General Managerwould,  of course,  be regarded as the employer of labour on therailways and he should have the support of a Chief Officer to dealwith personnel and labour relations matters on a day to day basis.But there will be a number of important issues which have to betaken to Board level,   and it is important the the Chief general manager should not have to devote a disproportionate amount oftime to them.     Furthermore,   labour relations will be one of the major responsibilities of the Board as a whole,   and they may wellfind it important that there should be another one of their number,in addition to the Chief General Manager,  with a special interest inthis field.     The labour relations member should,  however,  havea wider remit than the Chief Officer,  and should not be regardedmerely as the functional head of his department.3.32 We do not think that it is possible to lay down any precisenumber of Board members.     This will depend on the changing circumstances of the railway industry,  and the different types ofpersonality on the Board.     It also depends upon the extent to which,in practice,  the  Chief General Manager finds that he needsassistance,  at Board level,   in the discharge of his duties for general management over the system as a whole.    We suggest that thenew legislation should   provide for a minimum of three,   and amaximum of six,   such full-time Board members,  including the one
dealing with labour relations,  but in addition to the Chief general manager and the members with specific responsibilities for planning and finance.Level of Remuneration and other Conditions of Service  (includingPensions)  for Board Members and Chief Officers3 . 33 We are seriously concerned about the current level of remuneration and other conditions of service for members of theBoard,  and for Chief Officers.     This is so vital a matter thatwe have concluded that we should make detailed enquiries,  andwe intend to make recommendations in a subsequent report.In the meantime,   this matter is of such importance that it wouldbe wrong for us to make general recommendations about the structutof the new Board without making it plain that,  in our view,substantial increases will be required in the level of remuneration and in the other conditions of service  (including pensions)  both for Board Members and for Chief Officers.Headquarters  Staff3 . 34 It will be obvious from the recommendations made above that most Board members should not have specific functionalresponsibilities,  that a vital role will be played by the Chief officers at Headquarters,   who would carry full responsibility as heads of departments.     Except for those Chief Officers concerned with the planning and finance functions which we suggest should be theresponsibility of the two members described in paragraphs 3.23to 3.29 above,  the Chief Officers would report to the Chief general manager.     This would not,  however,  prevent the development of clorelations with any of the full-time members of the Board who mighthave accepted a special interest in their sphere of responsibility.Part-Time Members3.35 We recommend that there should be at least three part-time members,  who should be appointed for their ability and experience rather than on any representational basis.     Specifically
the Group do not favour the proposal put forward by the Board thatthere should be representation on the Board of the National coal board,  the National Steel Corporation and the National FreightOrganisation.    We are satisfied that the necessary co-ordinationwith those bodies can be achieved in other ways.3.36 We further recommend that the period of service for part-time members should be restricted.    We do not wish torecommend any exact time limit,  but suggest that when the Ministerand the Chairman consider individual appointments they should bearin mind that,  on the one hand,  part-time members should servefor long enough to ensure that the Board get full value from their experience,   and the contribution they can make whilst,  on theother hand,  there should be sufficient change in their ranks inorder to provide for the necessary infusion of new ideas at regular intervals.     In this connection we think there will be considerable advantage in providing for greater flexibility in the remuneration of part-time members than is now customary.    We have in mind thatthere may be occasions when an eminent outsider,  whose services would be of value to the railways,  might be prepared to serve onsay a half-time basis with a consequential and desirable enhancementof his responsibility compared with that of a normal part-timemember.A General Scheme of Organisation and the Place of the Regions3.37 We have already set out in paragraphs 3.7 to 3.12 thegeneral considerations,  present and future,  which in our view will affect the relations between General Management at the centre,and Regional Management.    We have also referred in para.   3.13 tothe effect on the shape of the Board&apos;s management structure ofthe setting up of the National Freight Organisation and passenger transport Authorities and to the developments which are leading toa greater element of central direction.    All these considerations are consistent with our recommendations for a small non-functionalBoard,  and the appointment of a Chief General Manager.
3.38 We are agreed that the existing statutory regional boards no longer fulfil any essential function,   and may indeedmilitate against the effectiveness of Headquarter control.     Accordinglywe recommend that the provision in Section 2 of the transport act,  1962,   relating to the establishment of Regional Boards,   shouldbe repealed.3.39 We are impressed by the desirability of affording to theChairman of the Board and the Minister the greatest possibledegree of flexibility in developing a Board structure and organisation that meets the needs of a situation that is,  andis likely to continue to be,  fluid.     Accordingly we have noted with interest the precedent created by the Iron and Steel Act,1967,   which provides for the submission to the responsible Ministerfor his approval of a general scheme of organisation for theindustry.3.40 Our studies so far have led us to believe that it will benecessary in the future for the centre to assume a greater degreeof control over many of the Board&apos;s activities,  and that the role of Regional General Managers will certainly change.     There mustbe a clear delegation of management responsibility within the limits of specified policy and planning objectives,   and it will be desirablethat the chain of command should be reduced in length wherever practicable.     But these are detailed matters on which we do not feel qualified to put forward specific views,  particularly as their development will necessarily be a lengthy process.    We therefore recommend that a provision corresponding to that in the Ironand Steel Act,  1967,   should be included in the Transport Billto provide that the Railways Board should submit a general schemeof   organisation to the Minister for her approval within a specified period of the date of coming into operation of the Act.    We suggestthat the Board should be required to submit the first of such schemes within an initial period of 12 months.    We think that it
would be desirable for the Minister herself to have a continuingpower to initiate a change, if she thought one to be necessary,in the absence of proposals by the Board.3.41 In their original submission the Board suggested that toppolicy co-ordination would be achieved through an Executive PolicyGroup consisting of the  Chairman and the two Vice-Chairmen whom they proposed.     If,  in the event,   it is decided to set up such a group,  which we suggest should be   particularly concerned withplanning,  the details would no doubt emerge from the general schemeof organisation which the Board will be required to put forward to the Minister.    We suggest that it would in any case be appropriate that,   whatever their ranks on the Board,   such a group should include,  in addition to the Chairman,  the Chief general manager whom we recommended in paragraphs 3.19 to 3.22,  and the planning and finance members whose functions we have described inparagraphs 3.23 to 3.29.The Board1 s Ancillary Activities3.42 It will clearly be necessary to consider whether activitiessuch as workshops,  hotels and shipping should be hived off intoseparate management units or companies.    We think that it wouldbe inappropriate for us to seek to reach firm conclusions onthis issue in the absence of a clear appreciation of all the relevant factors .Supporting Documentation3.43 We have attempted to keep this part of our report as shortas possible consistent with our obligation to set out our recommendations and the reasons for them clearly.     The original submission bythe British Railways Board,  the Report by Mr.  Pears of CooperBrothers,   and the separate letter giving an expression of hisown views are all available for reference,  if necessary,  both within the Ministry and the Board.
Part IVLEGISLATION3.44 The legislative provisions consequent upon our recommendation are relatively simple and fall under three headsas follows: -3.44.1     An amendment of  Section 1 of the Transport Act 1962to provide for the amended size and composition of thenew Board,   including a provision on the lines of sub-paragraph 1(8)  of Part I of the Fourth  Schedule tothe Iron and Steel Act,   1967.3.44.2    The repeal of Section 2 of the Transport Act,   1962which provides for the setting up of Regional Boards.3.44.3    A new provision will be necessary on the lines of thatin  Section 4 of the Iron and  Steel Act,   1967,   requiring the Board to put forward a general scheme of organisation for the Minister&apos;s approval within a specified period .
&quot; SECTION 4References to paragraphs inother sectionsand AppendicesFINANCE4.1 Our summary of the likely financialposition of the Board in 1969,   and 1974,  beforeallowing for any capital  reconstruction,   is setout in paragraph  2.26.2.6 This table starts with the Board&apos;s financial2.11 forecasts,  which are set out in Appendix E22.26 and which show a break-even position onE2 operating account in 1974.  These figures take account of the establishment of the NationalFreight Organisation, but not of any grants for social passenger services or trackrationalisation.     After studying these figures wehave concluded that,   unless there are major changes in policies,   the likely results in 1974might well be up to  40m.  worse than theBoard have forecast;   on the other hand,   at best,  they would be unlikely to be more than 10m.  better.2.14 -2.16 4.2 The best estimate,  on the available evidence,  is that the &quot;social&quot; grants forunremunerative passenger services,   which werecommended in our Interim Report,   will notexceed  40m.   per annum in 1969,   and  35m.per annum in 1974,  excluding interest in both cases.SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS ANDRECOMMENDATIONS
4.3 The grant for track rationalisationdescribed in paragraph 4.27 below,   is likely2.23 to be of the order of  15m.  per annum in 1969;this grant will have reduced to zero by 1974,but by that date the Board should have achievedsavings of about the same order.4.4 After taking account of these likely2.26 grant levels,   and after charging interest,  we estimate a deficit for the Board in 1974 of between  5m.   and  55m.4.5 On the basis of the above conclusionswe are satisfied that a considerable write-off of2.27 existing capital debt to the Minister is inevitableif the Board are to be given realistic financial objectives.4.6 We Recommend that the capital debt2.28 cf the Board should be written down to a level at which it can reasonably be expected that the2.42.1 interest payments can be found out of prospectiverevenue early in the 1970s.4.7 We Recommend that the &quot;break-even&quot;2.42.2 thus envisaged should be based on neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic a forecast of theBoard&apos;s revenues in the early 1970s.2.31 4.8 We Recommend that the valuation of2.42.4 the assets should also be scaled down to whatis represented by the new capital debt.4.9 We Recommend that appropriate2.33.1 arrangements should be made for dealing with .42.5 any surplus on revenue account in case,  as aresult of following the previous recommendations
for cutting down the capital debt,  the amount ofwrite-off necessary has been overestimated;  inparticular,  the Minister should have power to direct that any surplus,   after taking the Board&apos;s requirements into account,  is paid into theExchequer.4.10 We Recommend that there should nolonger be provisions for deficit grants from theMinister  (except perhaps for the transitional period1969 to 1971) :   and in particular that no deficit grant should be payable in respect of depreciationprovisions .4.11 We Recommend that the Board&apos;s othercontinuing obligations deriving from the past (inrespect of road bridges,   level crossings,superannuation and the Police,)   should be takeninto account in the capital reconstruction which werecommend in paragraph 4,6  above and that thereshould not be specific and continuing grants.4.12 We Recommend that ways should befound of compensating the Board for the cost tothem of subventions to operators of bus services provided in place of withdrawn rail services.STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION4.13 We conclude that the setting up of new national and regional transport organisations,   andtechnical developments within the railways,   will  allinfluence the shape of the central structure of theBoard,   and the relationship between the centre  andthe Regions.     Against this background we have tried to foresee the management structure which would be appropriate in a few years time,  while recognising that there will be a transitional period during whichdifferent   arrangements   may be needed:  on these we make no specific recommendations.
4.14 Our general conclusion is that the3.15 Board should as far as possible be free to3.30 concentrate on policy questions and in particular on the problems of future planning,   and theindividual members should not be tied down by day-to-day responsibilities for specific functions.We therefore Recommend that ultimately theBoard should consist largely of non-functionalmembers,   and should be smaller than at present.Chairman4.15 We Recommend that the Chairman of3.16 the Board should be relieved of day-to-dayresponsibilities,  in order to be able to concentrate on the major issues of policy, and to project theBoard&apos;s image both within the organisation and tothe public at large.&quot;Chief General Manager&quot;4.16 We Recommend that a single member of3.19-22 the Board should be responsible for controlling andco-ordinating all  aspects of the day-to-day running of the railways.     He is envisaged as a &quot;ChiefGeneral Manager&quot; whom it might be appropriate toappoint as a Deputy or Vice-Chairman.    He would co-ordinate commercial,  operating and technicalrequirements in respect of both passenger and freigtraffic.Planning4.17 We Recommend that one member of the3.24 Board,  who might be a Vice-Chairman,  should3.29 have specific responsbility for the co-ordination of long range planning in the railways.Finance3.27 4.18 We Recommend that another member, w3.29 might also be a Vice-Chairman,  should have specif&apos;responsibility for financial policy.
4.23 We are confident that substantial increases will be required in the level of remuneration and in.33 other conditions of service  (including pensions) , both3,36 for Board members,  and for Chief Officers,   and we propose to make recommendations in a later report .There should be greater flexibility in the remuneration of part-time members than is nowcustomary.Regional Boards4.24 We Recommend that the statutory provisions3.38 relating to the establishment of Regional Boards shouldbe repealed.Labour Relations4.19 We Recommend that one member of the3,31 Board should have specific responsibility for the longer-term development of labour relations.Full-Time members .20 We Recommend that in addition to the3.32 &quot;Chief General Manager&quot;,   and the members with responsibilities for planning,  finance and labour relations,  there should be provision for a minimum of two,   and a maximum of five other full-timeBoard members.Part-Time members .21 We Recommend that there should be at,35 least three part-time members,  who should beappointed for their ability and experience ratherthan on any representational basis.Period of Service of Part-Time Members3.36 4.22 We Recommend that the period ofservice of part-time members should be restricted.Remuneration,  Etc.,  of Board members and of Chief Officers
The General  Scheme of Organisation4.25 We Recommend that the Railways board.40 should be required to submit a general scheme of organisation to the Minister for her approval withina specific period  (say 12 months)   of    the cominginto operation of the Act.     The Minister shouldhave  a continuing power to initiate changes,  if shethinks they are necessary.TRADE UNION VIEWS1.7 4,26 We have taken account in the above a recommendations of the views which the TradeUnions expressed to us on matters of finance and general Board structure;  their views on other subjects are set out in Appendix A,  but their comments have not led us to make any specific recommendations on those of the matters to whichthey referred which are within our terms ofreference, &quot;&apos;&quot;STANDBY&quot; AND &quot;SURPLUS&quot;INFRASTRUCTURE CAPACITY1.8 4,27 After a detailed investigation we have2.20-23 concluded that it is highly unlikely that &quot;standbycapacity&quot;  additional to that required for theB railways&apos;   commercial and social services couldbe proved to exist as a permanent element of any.     foreseeable railway network.     There defintely issurplus capacity in the system,  however,   andWe Recommend that,  for the reasons set out at length in paragraphs 2.20 to 2.23,  it would be right to pay a grant to the Board,  fixed in advance and on a tapering basis,  to assist in the elimination of this surplus and the rationalisation of the system.
OTHER OBLIGATIONS deriving from THE PAST_Road Bridges and Level Crossings4.28 We have concluded that,   although thereis a good case in equity for transferring roadbridges over the railway to local or highway authorities,  on the basis that they should beregarded as part of the highway,  the case in lawis less good,   and the practical difficulties are too large to be ignored.    We therefore Recommendthat ownership of the bridges should remain withthe Board,  but that account should be taken ofthe costs of their maintenance,  which amount toabout  l-^m.  per annum,  in the capital reconstruction which we recommend.4.29 We also Recommend4.29.1      that the Board&apos;s presentpayment of  40,000 per annum in respect of trunk road bridgesshould be discontinued;4.29.2    that the Board&apos;s presentresponsibility for the surfacesof all over line bridges shouldbe borne by the appropriatelocal authority;4.29.3    that the Board&apos;s present duties in respect of the maintenance ofbridges should be brought up-to-date ,   and4.29.4    that the powers of the InspectingOfficers of Railways in relationto railway bridges already owned by local authorities should beextended.
responsibility for their Museum at Swindon tothe Swindon Corporation but,that,  failing this,they will have no alternative to continuing tobear the costs falling to them under the termsof their existing agreement with the Corporation.Railways Savings Banks2.17 4.35 We Recommend that account should2.29 be taken   of the interest burden on these SavingsC18 Bank deposits in the capital reconstruction whichwe recommendTransport Police2.18-19 4.36 We have concluded that there is aC19-C24 case for some public contribution towards thesecosts,  to the extent of about  600,000 per annum,and We Recommend that this should be taken intoaccount in the proposed capital reconstruction.Costing of Unremunerative Passenger ServicesD12 4.37 We Recommend that the costing basisused for the calculation of grants for these services from Passenger Transport Authoritiesshould be the same as that adopted for the calculation of grants to be paid by the Minister.LEGISLATION4.38 Legislative provisions will be neededas follows  : -4,38.1   An amendment of Section 1 of theTransport Act,  1962,  to providefor the amended size and composition of the new Board,  including aprovision giving the Minister a powerto appoint one or more members ofthe Board as Deputy or Vice-Chairman
4.38.2 The repeal of Section 2 of the transport act,   1963,  providing for the setting upof Regional Boards,4.38.3 A provision requiring the Board to putforward a general scheme of organisation for the Minister&apos;s approval within a specified period.4.38.4 Provisions to give effect to our financialrecommendations .4.38.5 Provisions to give effect to our recommendations on bridges over railwaysand museums and historical records.APPRECIATION4.39 Although we shall be submitting one or more further reports to you later in the year,  the completion of this report and the Interimone which we submitted in January provides an appropriate opportunityfor us to express our thanks for the assistance we have receivedfrom our two Joint Executive Directors,  Mr.  Hammond andMr.  Lazarus,  and from the Secretariat.    A very heavy burden ofwork has fallen on their shoulders,  not only in the drafting andcirculation of the numerous papers and minutes of our meetings butparticularly in the preparation of this report.    They have performedtheir tasks to our entire satisfaction and we are most grateful to them.Signed on behalf of theJoint Steering GroupJohn MorrisChairmanD. BarlowSecretary6th July.  1967
VIEWS OF THE RAILWAY TRADE unions on MATTERS OTHER THAN FINANCE and management STRUCTUREA.l. We explained in our Interim Report  (paragraph 2.8)that we hoped to have Union views on a number of matters,  andwe have now had written evidence from all three Railway Unions,and have held a separate meeting with representatives from eachUnion.    We have had views from each Union both on finance andon management structure,   and have taken account of them inthe recommendations which we make in Sections 2 and 3 of themain part of this Report.     There are a number of other matterson which the Unions have put views to us which we think theMinister and the Chairman would wish us to report,   and these are set out in the succeeding paragraphs.ClosuresA.2. All three Unions were in favour of a halt to furtherclosures pending the determination of future policy.    ASLEFthought that closure of lines and withdrawals of service should behalted pending the establishment of &quot;a sound and rational basis for costing&quot; .     They thought that joint consultation should play agreater part in the consideration of closures,  and that the valueof feeder lines to the main line services should receive greater emphasis.     The NUR stressed the importance of correct costing of closures,   and thought that the subsidies to bus operatorswhich the Railways are required to pay as a condition of closureshould be taken into account.     TSSA pointed out the harm done to the railway image by continual closures,  and the need toconsider whether branch lines could not be saved by the kind of cost-cutting exercises now being carried out in East Anglia.A.3. We explained to the Unions that in fact  :-APPENDIX. A
A. 3.1    Cooper Brothers have said that the Board1 s presentcosting principles are generally sound,A. 3.2   there is no evidence that the elimination of branch lineshas deprived the railways of an appreciable amountof profitable traffic,   andA. 3.3 passenger closures since the spring of 1963 are savingabout  17m.  per year.A. 4. ASLEF  suggested that restricting the level of service on unremunerative lines was harmful to the image of the railways,but on the other hand in our Interim Report we recommended(paragraph 11 of Annex A)  that the Minister and the Chairmanshould consider whether the Board should proceed with specificchanges which would result in substantial savings in cost.A.5 The NUR thought that there was a case for a contribution by local authorities towards the cost of providing railway services,because the value,  for example,  of houses in areas served bythe railways is enhanced by improved railway services.    Wehave been informed of the development of the policy outlined in the White Paper  (paragraph 27)  for part of the responsibilityfor the retention of passenger services to be devolved onto localcommunities.    We do not think that this is a matter on which wecould usefully comment further.     We have,  however,   said inSection 2 of this Report that whilst further thought needs to begiven to the means of meeting the cost of replacement bus serviceswe are of the definite view that the Board should not longer berequired to do so once the new finance provisions apply ( see also paragraph 11 of Appendix D).A. 6. We were informed of the agreement that had beenreached with the Unions that they should receive more detailed figures about the cost of railway services proposed for closure.The Ministry representatives agreed at the meeting with ASLEFthat the Ministry would consider how they could take account of major points raised by the Unions about individual closures.
Road/Rail Track CostsA.7. ASLEF stressed that road/rail competition should berationalised,  with particular reference to railway track costs.The Ministry representatives have provided us with a summary ofthe previous arguments on this issue,   and at our meeting withASLEF they put forward the view that overall the total costof the road system   (including various ancillary costs such asthose of accidents)  was heavily outweighed by the total licenceduty and fuel tax derived from all road users.     The Ministryalso explained that they did not think that the case for saying that heavy goods vehicles and buses did not make an adequatecontribution had been proved.    We know that this is a matter which is very much under consideration in the Ministry,  and donot think that it would be appropriate for us to make any furthercomment on the issues involved.A.8. We have,  however,   recommended in Section 2 of thisReport that specific account should be taken of the costs ofrailway-owned over line road bridges in the capital reconstruction of the Board .Control of Withdrawals of Freight Services and Closures of freight StationsA.9. ASLEF recommended that these should be made subject to the control of the Minister,  because of their importance for the overall transport policies which the Minister was now working out.     At our meeting with ASLEF,  the Board pointedout that their policy of freight concentration,   and the use of linertrains, had in fact meant that more freight traffic was beingcarried on certain services.    At the same time,  the railwaysrecognised that there were other freight traffics which would bedeclining .A. 10. We do not think that the case has been proved thatcloser Ministerial control over withdrawal of freight services and
closure of freight stations would serve any useful purpose,  and wehave decided not to make any specific recommendations.    Weexplain in Appendices B and D to this Report that the ministry and the Board are jointly pursuing certain questions relating tothe allocation of track costs for freight services,   and their implications for the control of the withdrawal of freight services,which arise from the Group&apos;s work on the problems of surplusinfrastructure capacity.Joint ConsultationA. 11. This is one of the subjects being considered underthe auspices of the Minister of Labour,  and is not within the termsof reference given to us.    We confine ourselves,  therefore,  toreporting that in the evidence given to us there was generalstress on the need for improving the way in which the machineryfor joint consultation was used.     ASLEF said that whilst certain modifications were necessary,  they thought that the present system was right.    But harm had been done by this machinery being used for consideration of closure cases.    TSSA took the same view that only minor modifications were necessary.    But it was recognised that recent changes,   and the number of closures hadthrown a great strain on the system .     None of the Unionssuggested to us that any substantial modifications would be necessary.Staff Participation in ManagementA. 12. TSSA thought that there should be more consultationwith the staff,  but that it would be wrong for the Unions to have any share in management decisions.     There should be members with trade Union experience on the Board,  because of the individualcontribution they could make,  but there should not be directTrade Union or staff representation on the Board.A. 13 . This is a matter which is currently being consideredby the Government in relation to all the nationalised industries and we do not think that we are required to comment on the viewsput to us.    But we should explain that in looking at the overall
problem of the Board&apos;s management structure we have concentrated on the shape and size of the Board,  and have not thought itnecessary for us to recommend how Trade Union representations should be dealt with.    This seems to be mainly a question forthe Minister when she comes to make appointments to the new board.The necessity for Adequate Public services a. 14 In their evidence the NUR pointed out the importanceof clean and comfortable trains,  a conveniently timed service,speedy services,  courtesy and assistance from the staff,comfortable station facilities and punctuality of trains.  These-mustbe provided at an economic price.     They also thought that furtherelectrification was important.     TSSA thought that a unified farestructure and well prepared timetables were important.    They alsostressed the need for the removal of derelict station buildings.A. 15. These all seem to be matters which properly liewithin the management responsibility of the Board,  and we wouldnot wish to comment,  except to emphasise that,  as set out generally in our recommendations in  Section 2,  and apart from theunremunerative passenger services,  which are to be grant aidedon broad social and economic grounds,  the need for the future willbe for the Board to plan to provide services which are attractive to the public and which can be run at a profit.Need for a Separate Police force (a).16. The NUR thought that the present Transport Policetended to act on behalf of the Railway management in matters concerning individual railwaymen,  and that there would be advantages in the Police being independent of the Railways Board.A. 17. This is not a question which we have been able toconsider in any detail,  but it seems to emerge from the work doneby the Joint Team that there are very strong reasons why theexisting Railway Police should be maintained.    The views ofthe NUR on what is essentially a narrow aspect of the police
functions do not,   in our view,  go near to outweighing thearguments in favour of the force being continued.Advantages of ElectrificationA. 18. As already stated the NUR regard this as important in order to provide a good standard of service for the public.TSSA thought it important for the good image of the railways.A. 19. No separate comment is necessary,  other than to refer to the various places in this Report in which we have stressed theneed for forward planning in order to ensure that,  for the future,investment in major capital schemes is only approved in caseswhere the Board and the Minister are satisfied on the financialreturn to be obtained from the investment.Need to Improve Career ProspectsA. 20 . TSSA referred to the importance of career prospects,and thought this could be achieved by improvement of the quality and conditions of work.    Their main aim was that the best manpossible should be acquired for a particular post,  but so faras practicable the expertise already available within the industry should be fully utilised.    Whilst recognising the need for movement between the various sectors of the nationalised transport industry,they were in principle against senior managers being recruited from outside industry.A. 21. At the meeting with TSSA,  the Board representativespointed out the need for injecting new blood into the railways fromtime to time,   not least for training purposes.    We accept the needfor selecting the best available people for the top managerial posts,and clearly this cannot always be done by picking people alreadywithin the railway industry.    But it is important,   not least forthe purpose   of raising morale,  that it should continue to be seen by all those within the industry that there is no bar to the promotion of able railwaymen to top posts.
Retention and Strengthening of the Financial Management services a.22. TSSA thought it important that this central service should be maintained and strengthened,  and that even when NFOcame into existence,  there should be no attempt to split this centralservice.     This was particularly important in the light of thegreater use and complexity of computers.A.23. We have included recommendations in Section 3 ofthis Report for the control of the central finance services.     CooperBrothers are due to report to us in the near future on managementinformation and financial control,  and we hope to put forwarddetailed recommendations in the autumn.    We would expect thatthe administrative arrangements eventually agreed for the NFOwould allow appropriate co-ordination in   this field.Labour ProductivityA.24. TSSA thought that this would be achieved by recuitingan improved quality of staff.     They also pointed to the problems for supervisors of the bonus payments for wages staff.A.25. These are clearly matters which fall within the Ministerof Labour&apos;s enquiry,  and we do not think that we should comment.
160APPENDIX B&quot;STANDBY&quot; AND &quot;SURPLUS&quot; INFRASTRUCTURECAPACITYSUMMARYB.l. We referred in our Interim Report Annex A Part III tothe Special Committee which we had set up to study in detail the concept of standby capacity which was specifically included in our terms of reference.    We said then that we were agreed that wewere concerned with standby capacity in infrastructure (i.e0formation,  track and signalling,  etc.)   and not with any standby interminals,  depots or wagons and carriages.    We were also agreedthat the real question was how far,  if at all,  would the proposedfuture railway network,   as broadly agreed between the Minister andthe Chairman of the Board,  contain standby capacity which wasadditional to that standby capacity required  (a)  on commercialgrounds,  and (b)  for the social services.    In other words,  andthis seemed to the Group    a most important point to emphasise,  wewere looking for surplus which was additional to that which therailways would need for sound commercial reasons (e.g. to cope with predictable peaks or to assist operational efficiency. )    Wewere also aiming to identify the nature of such surplus,  why itexisted,  and,  if any part of it was likely to persist, the reasons why.B.2. In the light of details investigations carried out on their behalf,  the Committee finally agreed that it was highly unlikely thatstandby. capacity as set out above,   (i.e.   additional to that requiredfor commercial and social services) ,  could be proved to exist asa permanent element of any foreseeable railway network.    We    (accept this view.
B.3. The Committee were agreed,  however,  that theredefinetely was considerable surplus capacity in the system,  thecost of which the Board would be unable to bear unaided if thecontinuance of the deficit was to be avoided.    The essentialdistinction is that standby capacity would have permanence:surplus is essentially temporary and capable of removal.    this surplus was mainly a matter of excess track capacity,  and wasrelated only to a minor extent to excess route mileage.    In other words, it was more relevant to look at the width of the individualroutes within the system,  rather than at its total length.B.4. As described in detail in paragraphs B.12 to B.14below,  we accepted the Committee&apos;s recommendation that a programme of work should be settled to identify this surplus, sothat its cost could be assessed,  and a programme could subsequently be agreed for its elimination.WORK OF THE STANDBY CAPACITY COMMITTEESurplus in the System as a Whole &apos;*B.5. An initial approach adopted by the Committee was toassume that standby capacity was maintained by the railways inthe form of a number of routes which were additional to thosewhich would be provided by a fully commercial system.    Thus itwas thought that the difference between the 8,000 miles of routewhich would   have been likely to result from the approach containedin the Board&apos;s report,   &quot;The Development of the Major RailwayTrunk Routes&quot;,  published in 1965,   and the 11,000 mile systemsubsequently agreed between the Ministry and the Railways,  mightdisclose a quantifiable amount of standby capacity.     Considerationof these 3,000 miles of route and of the routes on the remaining8,000 miles,  disclosed that the Committee should be looking atroute capacity rather than route miles as such.
Examination of Specific RoutesB,6. The Board suggested that it might be helpful for theCommittee if special studies were made of a number of individualroutes of widely varying characteristics.    Three such studieswere made by a Ministry economist working on data provided byBritish Railways Board.B.6.1      The first route studied was the East Coast main line from King&apos;s Cross to Doncaster.    The study identifiedsome surplus capacity,  which would permit the running of an additional 36 express passenger trains,  or 18slow freight trains per day.    Its cause was the need tohave a signalling system which would pass expresspassenger trains at very frequent intervals during peakperiods.    In consequence,  capacity was available forthe rest of the day,  but it had not so far been possibleto sell this capacity to users.    It was implicit that thenet revenue from peak passenger services  adequatelycovered the cost of providing this surplus capacity.B.6.2     The next route studied,  Plymouth to Penzance,  was a&quot;secondary&quot; route on which the long term decline in summer holiday traffic had rendered some of the trackcapacity superfluous to present requirements.    It was found,  however,  that the regional management has plans for completely revised train services on the route,  witha consequent reduction of the track mileage,   and anincrease in track utilisation.  The route,  which is atpresent nearly all of double track is proposed for reduction to mainly single track with appropriate passingloops.    The resulting train and track capacity isconsidered adequate for present and future needs.    Thiswas a case where surplus capacity had been identified,
but by re-arranging and reducing the train services,it would be possible to eliminate nearly all of thesurplus capacity.     Some investment would be requiredfor the singling project,  but the potential savings were very high in comparison with the investment required.B.6.3     Finally,  a study was made of the Weaver Junction to Glasgow route,  as it would be after electrification.This is a route on which the railways would havealmost complete freedom to adjust the capacity to suitfuture commercial and operating requirements.  even with this freedom,  it was proposed to install surplus capacity,  so that the day-long rate of utilisationwould be only just over 60%.    As with the East Costmain line, this high level of capacity was caused bythe need to signal the route to carry short-run peaksof traffic at certain times of the day.    As these wouldin themselves be profitable traffics,  even including thecost of the extra capacity they required,  it was concluded that the existence of the surplus capacity on the routewould not impose a financial handicap upon the railways.B.7. It was implicit in these three reports that it is possibleto tailor the infrastructure capacity of a route to the expectedvolume and mix of traffic at least in the long term.    Any surplusis,  therefore,   almost entirely a matter of commercial choice (e.to cope with profitable peaks)  or of history.    There may well becircumstances in which it is cheaper to leave the surplus,   at anyrate for a time, than to incure the expenditure required to eliminateit.
Distinction between Standby and SurplusB.8. The Committee finally agreed,   and we accept,  thatthere is certainly surplus capacity in the existing network,   andthis creates a financial problem since,   as the Board have consistently maintained,  to leave the whole responsibility withthem will merely ensure the continuance of the deficit.     TheCommittee therefore came to the conclusion that the best wayforward was to try to agree about the size and cost of this surplus infrastructure capacity,  to decide how long it would take to eliminate it,   and then to agree on a method of payment whichwould provide an incentive to the Board to get rid of this surplusas soon as possible.     The Committee agreed that,  given time,there should be no difficulty in calculating the extent of the surplus,though they recognised that it might vary over time in the light ofchanged traffic levels.Proposals for Identification of Surplus CapacityB.9. The Committee agreed that the extent of surplusinfrastructure would depend on the number and types of trains tobe run.    It could not,  therefore,  be divorced from operating and commercial considerations.    Only the Board would be in a positionto identify this surplus infrastructure in the light of the profitability of the traffics concerned.    Most of it would probably be found tobe on the &quot;secondary&quot; system,  but some would be on the &quot;primary&quot;system.    Most of it,   also,  would be in the form of double or multipletrack,  some of which could be reduced,  thus lowering maintenancecosts without reducing the route mileage.B.10o On lines used only by grant-aided passenger services,the Committee assumed that the full cost of the minimum necessarytrack capacity for these services would qualify for the social grant.Any existing capacity in excess of the minimum requirements  shouldbe identified separately and included in the calculation of surplus capacity,  with plans for its elimination.
B.11. Special problems arose in the identification of surplus capacity and the allocation of costs for grant purposes on linescarrying freight as well  as grant-aided passenger services,   andalso on  &quot;freight only&quot; lines.     The allocation of track costs,   wherea line is shared between freight and passenger services,   is a difficult question,   and it may not always be right to accept therecommendation in the original report from Cooper Brothers onCosting principles,  which advocated a continuance of the Railways&apos;present practice of calculating this on the basis of total train weights,As set out in Appendix D,  we are hoping to be in a position tomake firm  recommendations about this later in the year.RecommendationsB.12 The Committee therefore recommended that the followingplan of action should be taken by the Board  :-B.12.1     they should identify all existing surplus capacity whether on the secondary or primary system;B.12. 2    they should identify those lines on the secondary system which would be needed for social passenger services,but on which,   whilst they are so used,  the board would also run freight services.    In respect of these,the Board should consider whether the freight services were likely to require additional infrastructure andwhether they could meet its cost;B.12.3    they should estimate the cost of the continuing maintenanceof each element of surplus capacity and the capital cost(if any)  of its elimination;B.12.4    they should prepare a programme for the elimination of surplus capacity (taking into account the commitment toan 11,000 mile system).B.13 A capital investment programme should then be agreed with the Ministry for the elimination of the surplus.    A grant shouldalso be agreed, on a diminishing basis,   which would,  in the first year,  pay for the actual cost of maintaining this surplus.    The grant would be paid annually at a level which would be fixed in advance,
and which would be reduced year by year at a rate which assumed that the agreed elimination programme could be maintained.    Theeffect of this should be that the Board would be relieved of all the costs of their non-commercial surplus infrastructure provided thatthey succeeded in cutting it out as quickly as the programmeenvisaged.    The Board would then be left with a network which,after taking   account of the social subsidies,  should be able to playits part on a commercial basis in the country&apos;s transport system.It would be a much slimmer network than at present but it would retain the margin needed for commercial reasons,   and theCommittee did not believe that any additional surplus capacity need,or should,  be maintained.IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMITTEE&apos;S RECOMMENDATIONB.14. We accepted all these recommendations,  and decided toset up a further Committee to assist the Board in the formulation of their detailed proposals for the identification and costing of surplusinfrastructure and the preliminary assessment of its cost.    Theremaining paragraphs in this Appendix described the progress thathas so far been made with this work.B.15. There are three separate stages involvedB. 15 .1     The preparation of the broad estimate,   which we have included in Section 2 of this Report.B.15.2    Further work designed to produce,  by the autumn,   amore reliable estimate.B.15.3    The preparation over the next 18 months of a detailed assessment of surplus,  line by line,  the calculation ofits cost and the preparation of a plan for its eliminationover a stated period.Preparation of a Detailed Assessment of Surplus,  and its cost.Definition of SurplusB.16. It is assumed that it will be necessary to maintain and provide services over a specific route mileage determined by the
Network for Development, published in March 1967.    In thatcontext surplus track and signalling capacity can be defined asthat which can be eliminated at no cost,  or at a cost which will show a reasonable return on any necessary investment,   and yetstill leave sufficient capacity to operate such services  as arecommercially desirable and those services which the Ministerdecides should be retained on broad social and economic grounds.Establishment of SurplusB.170 To establish the extent of this surplus,   a criticalexamination must be made of the need for all track and signallingcomprising the 11,000 route mile network in relation to the trafficlikely to be  available on a commercial basis  and for social needs,as well as the methods by which this traffic will be moved.B.18. We  assume that the proposed Bill will become lawduring 1968,   and that the Government will decide to commence thepayment of grants in respect of this surplus from 1st January,1969.    We refer,  in future,  to this date as the &quot;prescribed date&quot;.We think it is a reasonable assumption that it will be feasible forthe Board,  before the prescribed date,  to produce a sufficientlyaccurate assessment of surplus,   and its cost,  on which the total     Iamount of grant can be calculated.B.19 The Board have made it clear that so far as commerciadesirable traffics are concerned account must be taken of theprecepts contained in the report on the Development of the RailwayTrunk Routes,  for the concentration of the maximum volume ofthrough traffic over the minimum of routes to reduce the cost per unit carried.B. 20. Even the best estimate of surplus capacity,  however,can be no more than an approximation of a theoretical position which could exist at some point in time.  It can never truly reflect the actual position on the track as changes in train speeds,  speed
mix,   and methods of operation will take place continually toimprove efficiency and productivity;   the demand for rail transport will also change,   and these factors will vary the actualdegree of surplus capacity.     It will be necessary before the&quot;prescribed date&quot; to make an assessment of surplus as it willbe likely to exist on that date,  or to be created over the period during which grants will be payable  (see paragraph B. 21 below).We assume that this will be five years,   and we refer henceforward to this five year period,  ending on 1st January,  1974,   asthe &quot;prescribed period&quot;.    This assessment will be required forthe purpose of calculating the size of the grant.    But we recognisethat this is necessarily a somewhat artificial picture,   and that inpractice the Board will need to review the extent of any surplus capacity as a continuing process.B.21. We are agreed that the Board will be required to assess not only the current surplus  at the prescribed date,  butalso that surplus which will be created by the changes in the levels of traffic,   and changes in operating methods and signalling over thenext few years and which,   at least as to the major part,  they expect to be able to eliminate over that period.     For this purpose the Board will estimate the likely pattern of operations by the endof the prescribed period in 1974,   and use this estimate as the basis for their calculations.    They will  also include all surplus which is currently in existence at the time that each individual line is surveyecA record will be kept of all surplus removed prior to the prescribeddate,   and the grant will cover the balance of surplus remaining.B.22. The Board have made it plain that while they accept their obligation to reduce track and signalling facilities to a minimumcommensurate with the services to be provided,  the identificationof surplus and its removal cannot coincide in time.     To achivethe necessary reductions it will be necessary in many cases toresigned,  to install track circuits and automatic level crossingbarriers,  to re-lay and re-align track and eliminate points andcrossings.     There is a limit to the physical resources  available
for this work in   design   offices,  in contracting firms,  in railwayworks and on the track itself,   and the Board regard it asunrealistic to suppose that resources can be concentrated to eliminate surplus capacity from the network  at a very rapidpace.     The most convenient time  at which to simplify a railwaylayout is when re-laying of the track becomes necessary orwhen signalling assets have reached the end of their useful life and must be replaced.     But there may be economic and financial reasons why earlier change is necessary.B. 23 . A decision about the priority to be given to the work involved in eliminating surplus will have to be reached by theMinistry and the Board direct when the full assessment of surpluhas been completed,   and when it is possible to compare the resfrom expenditure on the elimination of surplus against the expectereturn on investment for the development of the main routes and facilities.     The Board set a high value on the use of the availablresources for modernising and developing main routes to improvefficiency so that the best service can be given to the greatestnumber of the population and the largest sectors of industry.   Tbelieve that,  in terms of cash contribution to viability,  with the limited physical resources available,  investment in track andsignalling on a trunk route,   associated with electrification,  shouldachieve more and produce a much better net return to the railwthan investment in the engineering work required for the eliminatiof surplus.     But they recognise that it will be necessary to revithe priorities when the detailed assessment of surplus is availabland we agree that this assessment should be produced as quicklas possible.    When it is available,  the Board and the Ministry whave to explore alternative policies  and estimate their effect.
Grant for SurplusB.24. When the surplus has been identified by the methodsdescribed above,   and to the extent that elimination will not havetaken place by the prescribed date,  the amount of the grant forsurplus infrastructure to be paid initially  (i.e.  in 1969)  will bebased on : -B.24.1    the annual cost of the maintenance of track  andsignalling installations; and b.24.2   signalling operation costs,for those surplus facilities which will exist on the prescribeddate,  or which the Board estimate will be created during theprescribed period.    Pending settlement of the new capitalstructure for the railways it will not be possible to determine the future interest and depreciation element in the cost of surplus.For the time being,  therefore,  in the assessment of the cost of surplus,  interest and amortisation as it would be in presentconditions,   should be shown separately.Method of Calculation for different categories of lineB.25. The Board have informed us of the methods which they propose to adopt for the identification of surplus and the assessment of its cost and have explained that for this purpose it will be essential to divide the rail network into several different categoriesrelated to its use and the type of service operated.     We endorsetheir method of approach.Assumptions Used for the Estimate of the Order of magnitude Figure_B.26. We have explained in paragraph B.18 that we think it&apos;s a reasonable assumption that the detailed assessment can be substantially completed by 1st January,  1969.    But it clearlycannot be done in any shorter period.     In order to produce anorder of magnitude figure,  short cut methods had to be employed,and we accept the Committee&apos;s view that these methods are acceptable within the time constraint.
B. 27 0 The figures of the cost of surplus as estimated bythe Board,  together with the justification for a grant,  have been included in Section 2 of this Report,  dealing with the Board&apos;soverall finanical situation.     The Board,  with assistance from theMinistry of Transport economists,  will refine these figures so faras possible over the next few months in order to produce the be:available estimate before transport legislation is introduced into parliament.    We must emphasise,  however,  that there is boundto be a large element of uncertainity until the Board haveidentified in detail when surplus exists or can be created.
APPENDIX COTHER OBLIGATIONS DERIVING FROM THE PASTC.l. We have explained in paragraph 1.9 that the JointTeams have completed the work to which reference was madein our earlier Report,  where we gave a fairly full progressstatement in Part IV of Annex A.     The following paragraphs setout our final conclusions and recommendations,  except in so faras they involve finance,   in which case they have already been included in Section 2 of the main Report.ROAD BRIDGES AND LEVEL CROSSINGSC.2. As recorded in our last Report,   we asked the Team togive further consideration to the difficulties which we envisagedarising from  their earlier recommendations for the completetransfer of responsibility for these bridges to local authorities andthe Joint Team was reconstituted on a wider basis.BridgesC.3. In principle,   existing highway over line bridges shouldbe regarded as part of the highway,  and it is clearly inappropriatethat financial responsibility should remain with the railways.Although it would seem logical to transfer the bridges to highway authorities,  this is impossible because of the way the Rate  support grant is distributed.     It would,  therefore,  be necessary to transferthem to the larger local authorities.     But the Rate Support Grantis based on complicated calculations which would make it impossibleto compensate the local authorities in an equitable manner.(Figures submitted to us show that the compensation for thetransfer of these bridges would vary as between one authority andanother from  100 to  500 per bridge per annum).C.4. We have had to conclude that,   although there is a good case in equity for transferring the bridges,   in law the case is lessgood,  and the practical difficulties are too large to be ignored.In reaching this conclusion we have also had in mind that these
bridges represent only one-sixth of all the bridges for which theBoard are responsible,   and that in any case it would be sensible,on manpower grounds,   (as well as for safety reasons), to leavethe responsibility for the physical maintenance of these bridgeswith the Board,  since in practice,  even if they lost responsibilityfor these bridges,  the Board could hardly make any reduction intheir maintenance staff.C . 5 . We therefore recommend that ownership of road bridgesover the railway should remain with the Board,  but that as setout in Section 2,  account should be taken of these costs,  which amount to about  1-^rn .  per annum,  in the financial reconstructionwhich we propose.C.6. We also recommend that the Board&apos;s present paymentof  40,000 per annum in respect of trunk road bridges shouldbe discontinued.    We also suggest that,  even if the bridgesthemselves are to continue in the Board&apos;s ownership,  their presentresponsibility for ihe surfaces of all over line bridges should be borneby the appropriate local authority.     Finally,  the Transport Billshould bring up-to-date the Board&apos;s present duties in respect ofmaintenance at present based on minimum legal liability,   and thepowers of the Inspecting Officers of Railways in relation to railway bridges already owned by local authorities should be extended.Level CrossingsC.7. So far as level crossings are concerned,   we have concluded that the method of crossing operation,   and the fact that control must remain with the railways,  make it quite impossible to seek any financial contribution from the local authorities to the operating costs of public road level crossings,  although we note theMinistry&apos;s proposal to introduce legislation empowering localauthorities to contribute to the capital cost of their improvement.C . 8. In view of the extent to which level crossing costs havebeen inflated as a result of the growth in road traffic,   and thechange in its nature,  and also in the light of the additional
responsibilities which we are informed the Minister proposes toput on the Board in respect of accommodation and occupationcrossings,  we think that it would be right to relieve the Board ofa figure of the order of  lm .  per year.    We have recommended inSection 2 of this Report that this is the figure which should betaken into account in the calculations leading to our proposals forrecapitalisation.PENSIONSC.9. We explained in our Interim Report (Annex A paragraph20 to 22)  that the main questions to resolve were whether,  andif so how far,  the Board should be relieved of superannuation and pension liabilities relating to staff previously employed on social or abandoned lines,  and its obligations which result fromdecisions of the Board&apos;s predecessors.    There was also theproblem of the interest burden on superannuation and pension funddeposits and provisions which were no longer represented by anyviable assets.    We realised that in facing these issues we were asking whether the Board should,  in effect,  be regarded as anew body,   starting afresh from the current date,   with only the liabilities that they had chosen to impose on themselves for thefuture,  or whether it was right that they should be saddled withsome part at least of the legacy of the past.C.10. We suggested at that time that if the arguments forreleasing the Board from its obligations should be accepted in full,this might represent a sum of the order of  15m.  to  20m.  per year.    To do so,  however,  would be a most unfortunate precedent for other industries in a similar position.C.11. We have now looked into the figures in more detail,  andthink it may be helpful to set them out under two separate heads asfollows:
C.11.1    The Interest BurdenUsing 1965 figures the Board had to payC . 11.1.1     Interest on Superannuation and pension Fund portion of Provisionfor Retirement Benefits.  3.6m p. a,C.11.1.2    Interest on Fund balances heldon deposit by British railways board.  6.2m p.a,C.11.1.3    Interest on balance of BTC(Male Wages Grades)  pension scheme.  lm      p. a.Total  10.8m p. a.The capital sums to which these interest charges relate(about  270m.)  are not represented by cash,  but byfixed assets in which,   at one time or another,  themonies have been invested.     They are an integral part of the capital structure of the Board and theinterest charges to which they give rise cannot beconsidered separately from the question of the overallinterest burden of the Board&apos;s capital liabilities.C. 11.2   The Pensions Obligations resulting from the decisions,and practices,  of the Board1 s predecessorsThese obligations include the following :-C. 11.2.1    Future charges to revenue in respect ofa deficiency  (not yet quantified)  emerging fromthe application of realistic assumptions on wages,   etc.  to the valuation of the funds.The present capital value of these deficienciesmay well amount to a further  50m .
C . 11. 2 . 2 An unquantified figure reflecting the extentto which the Board may be involved in further deficiency payments attributable towhat the Board consider to be the undulygenerous provisions of the LMS pension scheme .The Joint Working Team have estimated that these andother pension obligations of which the Board consider theyshould be relieved (these include charges to revenue inrespect of the liquidation of  Superannuation Funddeficiencies,  the difference between the rate of interestcredited to funds deposited with the Board and a realistic rate of interest,  the difference between thecontributions actually being paid by salaried staff and what they would be paying under the contribution ratesprescribed in the new pensions scheme,   the cost of future deficiencies and the cost of payments undernon-statutory customary practices)  might amount toabout  8m.  to  9m.  per annum,  but this depends toa considerable extent on the rate at which anydeficiencies in the Fund were to be liquidated.C.12. These sums together add up to a total of about  17m.to  20m. per annum.    As set out above,   something over half ofthis relates to the interest burden on sums invested with the Board,the remainder to the burden on the Board resulting from decisionsof their predecessors.C.13. In addition to the foregoing there is a capital obligationestimated at  20m.   (resulting in an annual revenue charge of 1.6m.)  in respect of the back-dating element of the new wagesgrade fund and continuing obligations of  0.15m.  a year in respectof the extension of the benefits of the new fund to staff who retired between 1st January 1967 and the start of the new fund inAugust 1967 .    There are also deficiencies on other funds of the
order of  20m.  which are being currently met by charges to revenue at the rate of  1.5m.  a year.     This figure together withthe  1.6m.  mentioned earlier and the  0.15m. ,  have been allowed for as expenditure chargeable to revenue in the long-range revenueforecasts.C . 14. We accept the arguments which we mentioned in our last Report that it would set a dangerous precedent to make any specific grants in relief of the Board&apos;s pension obligations.    Theseare clearly obligations which have to be met,   and the only questionis whether the payment should and could be made in future by theBoard.    We recommend in Section 2 of this Report that account should be taken of these obligations in the financial reconstructionwhich we propose .C.15. So far as can now be assessed  (although these figures will need further study)  the total capital value of the pensions obligationsis of the order of  370m.  as compared with  275m.   in the balance sheet at 31st December 1966 .     The capital values adopted for thereappraised superannuation obligations assume an interest rate of 5%compared with the current rate of 4%.     The future annual interest burdwill therefore be of the order of  19m.   compared with the present figure of  11m.    Against this increase of  8m .  can be offset the avoidance of deficiency charges to revenue of some  3m .   leaving  5m,increased charges to be taken into account in the forward revenueestimates and the assessment of the debt to the Minister.MUSEUMS AND HISTORICAL RECORDSC . 16 . Since we submitted our Interim Report the Joint Teamhave been investigating the feasibility of implementing their main commendation,   that it would be in the interests of the railways board,   and beneficial from the standpoint of museum policy generally,that the Board should build a new Transport Museum,   for transfer to the Department of Education and  Science as an outstation of the science Museum,   with the funds realised from the sale of theClapham site.
C.17. After receiving their further report our main conclusions and recommendations are as follows:-C. 17 .1   It would not be possible to set up a new purpose-builttransport museum,   the primary purpose of which was toreplace the museum at Clapham,   within the financiallimits imposed by the earlier recommendation that the funds should come from the sale of the Clapham site.C. 17 .2 The conversion of an existing   building would enable a new museum to be provided out of the moneyreleased - which would probably amount to about 517,000 - by the sale of the sites of the presentmuseums at Clapham and York.     Neither the railways board nor the London Transport Board have a building available in the London area,  but the railways board have suggested the conversion of a motive powerdepot at York which would be well fitted to serve asa transport museum,   and which could be satisfactorilyconverted within the limits imposed by available funds.The Department of Education and Science would,   subjectto approval by Ministers,  be prepared to assume responsibility for a museum provided in this way,  and theMinistry of Public Building and Works would accept responsibility for its maintenance.C.17.3  If the proposed new museum at York was administered by the Department of Education and Science,  and thepolicy of charging for admission was continued,  total net costs would be about  15,000 a    year less than those at present incurred by the Railways Board on the existingtransport museums at Clapham and York.     Sincemuseaum  costs go to swell the railway deficit,  a move to York would reduce the total cost of the museumsto the Exchequer,  provided that the Department ofEducation and  Science were to continue the present
charging policy.     (To discontinue this charging policy would increase the present annual costs of thecollections to the Exchequer by about  10,000 p. a.)C . 17 .4 The conversion of the York depot would provide enoughspace for all those railway exhibits which,   in the viewof the  Science Museum,  merit preservation in anational transport collection.     The London transport board have indicated that they would prefer to take theirown relics back into their keeping rather than see themremoved to York,  and we understand that this should result in a decrease in the London Transport Board&apos;annual expenditure on relics.C.17.5 We recommend that those exhibits which would not qualify for inclusion in a national collection should,   inaccordance with the established practice,   in the firstinstance be offered free of charge to local museums and recognised preservation societies,  and those for whichhomes were not found should be sold.   &apos;* Any sumsrealised in this way should be added to the funds availablefor setting up the new museum .C . 17 .6  The Department of Education and  Science would notbe willing to assume responsibility for the museum atSwindon.    We therefore recommend that the railways board should attempt to negotiate the transfer ofresponsibility for the museum at Swindon to  SwindonCorporation.     Should this prove impossible,  we thinkthat the Board have no alternative to continuing to bear the costs falling to them under the terms of theexisting agreement.C . 17 .7 Whilst it would be physically possible to accommodate the records at present held in the Railways Board&apos;sRecord Office in London in a small extension,   costing about  60,000,  to the proposed York Museum,  it is
improbable that this could be done within the agreedfinancial limits.    But in view of the small sum concernedwe recommend that the occasion should be taken totransfer the historical records to York,   even if this cannot be done entirely within the financial limits set by the proceeds from the sale of the Clapham andYork sites .C. 18 .8 The Standing Commissions on Museums and Gallerieshave been consulted and are broadly satisfied with theabove proposals .C. 17 .9 We finally recommend that provision should be made inthe forthcoming Bill to enable these proposals to becarried out,  and that the necessary arrangements mightbe left to the Board and the Ministry.RAILWAYS SAVINGS BANKC.18. We included four specific recommendations in ourInterim Report (Annex A paragraph 31) .    We have dealt in  Section 2of this Report with the implication of the interest burden on theseSavings Banks deposits.     No other point arises on this subject,apart from  recording that, the Board have already largely implementedthe recommendations which we made.     Following the centralisation andcomputerisation of the existing banks at Darlington a new BRSavings Bank has now been established and the former banks closed.TRANSPORT POLICEC. 19 . We set out a brief statement of the arguments for and against some element of Exchequer grant for the Police in our last Report,   and said that our study of this item was still continuing.In the event,  the Joint Team was strengthened so as to includeinter alia a Treasury representative,  and the Finance Officer fromthe Home Office,  and submitted a further Report.
C . 20 . We are clear that while it is a matter for the railways board to consider whether they want to maintain a Police Force,and that an element of the force is entirely a commercialresponsibility of the Board itself,  at the same time it could besaid that some part of the benefit from the particular services ofthe Police devotedC.20.1 to the detection of crime andC . 20 . 2 to general public services(to which we referred in paragraph 32 of Annex A to our earlierReport)  accrued to the general public and afforded relief to thecivil forces.C . 21. It has proved impossible to provide a precise assessment of Police services and their benefits and any apportionment mustnecessarily   be a matter of judgment.     Some of us have argued that apart from any fall out benefit from the services of the TransportPolice as a whole,  the particular benefits accruing from the servicesdevoted to the detection of crime and the general public services were sufficiently substantial to merit financial recognition.C.22. Others of us disagree with this view,  and do not thinkthat it has been established that,   if the Board decided to limit theirpolice services to what would be desirable on commercial grounds,this would make a significant reduction in the British TransportPolice and its cost.     It is in their view clearly unreasonable to describe any fall out benefit to the community at large as being&quot;substantial&quot;.    Moreover,  there are fall out benefits in the otherdirection,   i.e.  to the Board from the activities of the civil Police.C.23. We have finally concluded that we must accept that thereis a case for some public contribution towards these costs.    Themain reason for this is that the Transport Police clearly performduties over and above those which are proper to a commercialorganisation.     In the past it has been expected that public bodiesshould assume some social obligations without remuneration,  but we
take it that it is now established Government policy to recompensethe railways for expenditure incurred for social reasons.     no precise basis for apportionment can be arrived at,  but we suggestthat calculations should be based on 50 per cent of the cost of theforce attributable to CID and to general public service functions.This- would amount to about  600,000 per annum,  i.e.  about20% of the total cost of maintaining the British Transport Police.C.24. We have therefore recommended in Section 2 of thisReport that the continuing services by the British TransportPolice to the general public should be recognised by including inthe proposed capital reconstruction of the Board a specific element in respect of these Police costs.
UN REMUNERATIVE PASSENGER services.l. We explained in our Interim Report that the P-EConsulting Group had been engaged in the preparation of a form- of questionnaire,   all or part of which,  depending oncircumstances,  would need to be completed by the british railways Board in respect of each service before an applicationfor a social grant was made,   and which could then serve asthe actual application form for such a grant.     Subsequently,  this work was developed by Cooper Brothers,   and they have nowproduced a form of questionnaire which we have provisionallyapproved,   and which is being tested in practice for a sampleexercise covering some 25 unremunerative passenger services.D.2. The purpose of the questionnaire is  :-D.2.1      to provide the Ministry with information on : -D.2.1.1       the present service and its operatingmethods;D.2.1.2      the present usage of the service andits financial results;D. 2.1.3      the Board&apos;s proposals for changes inthe service and its operating methods;D.2.1.4      a forecast of the financial results forthree years ahead.D.2.2     to enable the Board to demonstrate that the service isbeing,  or is planned to be,  operated at an optimumlevel - that is,   at the minimum deficit consistent withmeeting the local demand.APPENDIX D
D.2.3     to provide the Ministry with the basic information toassist them to make an assessment of  :-D.2.3.1      whether the social need is sufficient tojustify the subsidy;D.2.3.2     whether there is any scope for improving the financial results by reducing the levelof service or improving operating methodswhile still satisfying the basic social need.The assessment will have to start from the present service, butthe questionnaire is designed to lead to a decision being based onthe best available assessment of future needs.D.3. The assessment of social need is fundamental to theMinister&apos;s decision as to whether or not a service should begrant-aided.    The questionnaire provides for the Ministry toreceive basic information on the present usage of the rail servicetogether with a list of alternative transport services.    the consultants have advised that,  in their view,  this basic information should be sufficient in the majority of cases.    In some,  borderline,cases more information is required than the Board has in their possession and the Ministry will have to obtain this from whateversource is most convenient,  including possibly in the most difficultcases mounting a full market survey of passenger demand.D.4. The present and projected financial results will be setout in full,  and will also be expressed in terms ofD.4.1      percentages of earnings;D.4.2     rates per train mile;      and d.4.3     rates per passenger mile.The expression of the deficit as a percentage of earnings will be helpful by showing the extent to which current passengers are infact paying their way.    The expression of a rate per train milewill be useful primarily as a basis for comparison between services with similar characteristics.    The Consultants hope that the figure
expressed as a rate per passenger mile will be particularly-useful as an evaluation of the passenger benefit which wouldresult from the payment of a grant.    Whilst there will clearly be cases where on very strong social hardship grounds it maybe necessary to pay an exceptional rate per passenger mile,this figure should prove a yardstick against which preliminarydecisions can be reached.    It will also be a useful tool for the determination of priorities if,  in the long run,  the total amountof these grants has to be contained within an annual estimate.Cost Escalation and Incentives for Cost ReductionD.5. In their original Report on Subsidies,  Cooper Brothersrecommended that the subsidy should be agreed for a period of3 years and that no provision should be made for escalation of costs.    We accepted this recommendation in our Interim Report.It now emerges clearly that,  if this form of questionnaire is tobe used,  the Board will be required to take into account any possible economies in calculating the amount of the deficit whichis to be grant-aided.    It may, therefore,  be more difficult forthem to meet major increases in costs over the 3 year period.We have not yet found any solution to this point,  but we proposeto return to it when the assessments of the first 25 services havebeen completed.Track and Signalling CostsD.6. In their original report,  Cooper Brothers suggested,and we recommended,  that track and signalling costs should be allocated to services according to the weight and number of trainsconcerned.    In the light of the work of the Committee set up toconsider standby capacity,  we are now considering whether itwould be more logical,  in cases where the capacity of a route is determined solely by the peak needs of a grant-aided passenger service,  for that service to bear most of the costs of the track,and signalling,  with the other services only bearing a proportionof the wear and tear costs.    This would be particularly significant
in cases where a line was used jointly by a commuter passenger service and by other passenger and freight services.    We arearranging that,  in the processing of the sample exercise to whichwe have already referred,  both methods of allocating track costsshould be tried out,  in order that we can see the practical effectof the alternative approaches.    We propose to make furtherrecommendations on this point in due course.InterestD.7. We referred in paragraph 3.8 of our Interim Report,to the need to determine the basis on which an appropriate interestcharge should be made for the essets used in providingunremunerative passenger services.    We are agreed that in respectof these services the grant payable should include interest as a cost ranking for specific grant.    When the grant is paid by theMinistry we recommend that the basis should be a reasonableattribution of the actual interest payable by the Board.    Thisshould be subject to further discussion between the Ministry andthe Board.Capital Losses on Subsidised LinesD.8. We pointed out in paragraph 3.16 of our Interim Reportthat if a subsidised service were withdrawn before the fixed assetshad been fully depreciated,  then the Board would make a capitalloss,   and we said that we  were considering how this should be met.D.9 We  are agreed that in these circumstances the board should be compensated.     Consideration must also be given to caseswhere expenditure on renewals and periodic maintenance has notbeen fully recovered when the decision is taken to withdraw theservice.    We do not,  however,  think that it is for the Group torecommend the precise means by which this should be achieved,and this can be pursued direct between the Ministry and the Board.Cost of Replacement Bus services.10 We pointed out in paragraph 3.23 of our Interim Reportthat we still had to consider how best to cover the subventions tooperators of bus services provided as a condition of the withdrawalof rail services.
D.H We have still not been able to consider a detailedmethod for this,  because discussions are continuing within theMinistry as to the provisions to be included in the forthcomingTransport Bill about bus services generally.    Obviously thebest method for dealing with the comparatively small number of bus services provided in replacement for withdrawn rail services will depend on the general pattern of the provisions to be made about the greater number of bus services for the country as awhole.    We are however clear that it follows from the new proposals for the Board&apos;s finance that the responsibility for thesebus services should be removed from the railways.Passenger Transport AuthoritiesD.12 We have been kept informed by the Ministry about thedevelopment of thinking on the constitution and duties of passenger transport Authorities.    It is clear that,  certainly in respect ofunremunerative passenger services wholly within conurbations,  thearrangements which we have recommended for the payment of grants will not apply,   and that the responsibility for paying grantswill be laid upon these new Authorities.    But oh the assumptionthat this will not affect the overall financial position of the Board,we do not think that it is for us to go into the details of thearrangements which will be required.    We strongly recommend,however,  that the costing basis used for these calculations shouldbe the same as that adopted for the calculation of grants to bepaid by the Minister.Future Programme of WorkD.13 The results of the sample exercise mentioned inparagraph 1 of this Appendix will be available in the autumn,   andwe then propose to review the whole situation,   and to see howfar the recommendations of the Consultants will be adequate fordealing with the identification of unremunerative services,  thecosting of them,   and the preparation of material on which the
Minister can make a decision as to whether the service shouldbe grant-aided on broad social and economic grounds.    we hope that it will be    possible for us to submit a further reportearly in the Autumn,   and the thenceforward the railways canproceed with the submission of cases in respect of all theunremunerative passenger services which fall within the field ofour previous recommendations.    We regard it as important thatthis should be done as quickly as possible so that,  even before a statutory grant scheme comes into full operation,  the Boardmay be able to quote in their annual report more exact figuresof the extent to which the deficit is related to the burden of theseunremunerative,  but socially necessary,  passenger services.
APPENDIX ElLONG-TERM REVENUE FORECASTSSummary of Economic assumptions on which_forecasts were prepared_E .1.1Between 1967 and 1975 total output will expand by  per cent per annum,   industrial production by 3.3 per cent and wages will rise,   in real terms,  by 3 per cent per annum.There will be no inflation and no change in the prices paid bythe Board for materials and services.178m.  tons  in 1966,  will decline to 158m.   in  1969 and about135m.  tons in 1974.  *    Within the totals,   coal for electricitygeneration will rise slightly.     Consumption by the steel industry will be maintained and the remaining uses will decline,   somedrastically - e.g.  domestic.     Production will be concentratedincreasingly on the East Midlands and  South Yorkshire.E.1.3 Steel production,   which was 24im.  tons in 1966,will increase to 28m.  tons in 1969 and 31/32m .  tons in 1974.The changeover to imported  iron ore will continue and be substantially complete by 1974.E.1.4 Oil growth will be   diminished,   but not vitally,   bynatural gas developments.E.1.5 Chemicals will represent an important growth  industry.E.1.6 The population will rise by 2-^/3 million by 1974.Consumer expenditure will increase by 2.2 per cent per annum and car ownership,  at present 9^m . ,  will reach 16m . competition from air will be maintained on main routes over 200 miles and,with a likely decrease in the cost of motoring in real terms,   carcompetition will increase.E .1.2Coal consumption and exports which amounted toE.1.7There will be no Channel Tunnel by 1974.E.1.8The  11,000 mile network will be reached in 1969and maintained until 1974.
E.1.9 There will be no major difficulty in securing an allocation of investment for profitable projects or those essentialto maintain profitable  services.E . 1 . 10       There will be no difficulty in getting rid of freight traffic or services which cannot be made profitable.E.1.11       The relationship with the National Freight organisation will be such that the Railways&apos;   present losses on sundries,  whichis of the order of  20m.  per annum,  will be wholly transferredto that Organisation.*    The  Finance  Sub-Group considered an alternativeestimate on the basis of  120m.  tons in 1974.

/(h)COPY&apos;HO,    1 i 8RAIL&apos;,-.&apos;AY POLICY RLVIB&apos;7JOIffT -5TESRING GROUPInterim Report to the Minister of transport and thepI^airman--of the British Railways BoardSeotion    ____Introduction1.1    The V/iiite Paper on Transport Policy (Cmnd. 3057of July 1966) records the Government&apos;s conclusion thatfor the foreseeable future there would be a need, aspart of the country&apos;s transport system, for asubstantial railway network.    The social and other considerations which led to the decision to stabilise the rail network also made it necessary to devise a new financial framework for the railways.    Accordingly theMinister of Transport and the Chairman of the railways board set tip a Joint Steering Group to review certain aspects of the railway industry.The full terms of reference for this Joint Revieware reproduced as Annex B.The Members of the Joint Steering Group are listed in Annex C.1.2   To assist with our work we appointed two separatefirms of consultants, via. Messrs. Cooper Brothers and company and Messrs. P-E Consulting Group Limited, towhom we gave the remits set out in Annex D.    As a first step we asked Cooper Brothers to examine(a) the costing methods at present employed byBritish Railways, and(b) the methods by which any subsidies forunretnunerative passenger services should be calculated, controlled and paid.Later they were to look(c) at the Board&apos;s financial and budgetarycontrol procedures, and their managementinformation systems.v/e asked P-E initially(a)    to examine sample loss-making passenger services, and to assess what changes in service operating practices and farestructures might lead to an improvement in financial results;
(b) to consider how this kind of examination might best be applied to loss-making services generally, and(c) to look at the Board&apos;s methods and policies for marketing both for freight and passenger services.1.3   P-E have made useful progress with this work,but we have now decided to hand over all theconsultancy work to Cooper Brothers who will complete the remits   originally assigned to P-E.    As a finalstage, Cooper Brothers will be asked(a) to advise on any proposals by the Board onmanagement structure and to make recommendations,(b) to recommend the procedures to be adopted forforecasting the future income and expenditureof British Railways.1.4   Our terms of reference made mention of the continuing obligations deriving from the past whichrest on the Board, including those in respect of roadbridges and level crossings, of superannuation and pensions for past and present employees, and of theBritish Transport Police Force.    .7e concluded that it.;ould be best to have these and other similarobligations examined, in the first place, by JointTeams of officers from the Ministry, the Board, and insome cases the other Departments concerned.    These Teamswere set up immediately after the Joint Steering Groupbegan their work.1.5    ie have met eight times as a full Group, and inaddition there have been a number of meetings of selected members on specific subjects.Section 2.    Summary Progress report.1    It has always been envisaged that it would take us at least a year to complete the work allotted to us.    &apos;;7ethink it would be appropriate to draw attention to thefact that British Railways is a very large complex ofbusinesses employing today over 340,000 people and that because of this, and of the relatively short time thathas so far been available to us, it has not beenpossible for us to assimilate and report at the presenttime on the full ramifications of the problems involved./We-2-
-.7e were, however, asked to provide an Interim Report,by the end of 1966, which would in particular jive theMinister and the Chairman as much as possible of theinformation needed for determining the legislativechanges to be included in the forthcoming TransportDill.2.2   v/e have therefore devoted moat of our attention tothis part of our task, and Section 3 of this Reportjives our main recommendations on the principles to beadoi)ted for calculating, paying and controllingsubsidies for unremunerative passenjer services.This has involved us in a consideration of the costingmethods at present employed,  since on these will dependthe calculation of subsidies.    As indicated in fart 1of Annex A, we are satisfied that the costingprinciples and metdods at present used by the Railways,although open to improvement in a number of respects,are generally soLind and certainly   on an interim basisadequate for calculating the subsidies required.    ;.7ehave also thought it right to give some attention tothe various possible methods of reducing and controllingcosts and increasing revenue on subsidised services.These are described in fart II of Annex A.2.3   Paragraph 23 of the Jnite Paper says that theBoard&apos;s essential task will be to operate economically and efficiently on the new basis which provides forrealistic financial objectives, and to move as soonas. possible to a position of financial eequilibrium.2.4   One factor towards achieving the equilibrium willbe the arrangements made for dealing with the losses onunremunerative passenger services retained on broadsocial and economic grounds, on which the Consultantsare particularly engaged (Part II Annex A).2.5   Another factor will be the treatment of the cost ofstandby capacity which is specifically mentioned in our terms of reference..     V/e set up a Committee of the group to study this complicated rpaestion but their work is notyet completed.    (Part III Annex A)2.6   v/e have also to take into account the effect of any proposals we may develop regarding other burdens .on theRailways which we asked various Joint Teams to investigate.Reports on progress to date are in Part IV of Annex A, andare summarised belowc-&apos;     , /2.6 1
2.6.1    Road Bridges and Level CrossingsAlthough we had hoped, as a result of an earlyreport by the Seam, that it ^ould be possible .to open negotiations with the local authority associations totransfer public over line bridges to County councils and County Borough Councils, we have become concerned about the possible implications for the safety ofrailway operations and the learn have been asked toconsider this further.    In any case we doubt whether,at least for the time being, the negotiations could include level crossings.2.6.2   PensionsThis is an extremely complicated problem and very substantial sums of money are involved.    The working party has examined the problems involved and their implications and the Steering Group consider thatsolution must wait until v/e can see the likelyfinancial prospects of the Board and consider thecapital burdens which it will be sensible to placeupon the railways.2.6.3   Musgeu.met and Histcirjiaal^RecordsBoth should be transferred, to the Departmentof education and science, and housed together on onesite to be provided by the Railways Board if this canbe.done without financial loss.2.6.4. IlalJLj/ax tarings BanksThey should be kept in being, and steps shouldbe taken to increase the membership.    Por this purpose the interest rate should be raised.Mien the National Freight Organisation is set up,Bank membership should be extended to staff of that organisation.2.6.5.    Transport PoliceWe are still continuing our study of whether this force provides tance for the civil police to an extent sufficient to justify a specific subsidy.2.7   Cooper Brothers cannot yet make any estimateof the likely total size of grants for social services.(This phrase is intended to cover grants forunremunerative passenger services retained on broadsocial and economic grounds.    Por convenience thesegrants are referred to as subsidies in this report.)/Until.-4-
Until such an estimate is available, and we havedecided whether to recommend- a grant .in respect. ofstandby capacity (Paragraph 2*5.) and--of --the other financial burdens-on the&apos;.. Railways (Paragraph 2.6), - wecannot gauge how large the gap will be betweenthe Board&apos;s revenue and their remaining costs.    we discuss this further in Section k,2.8   We have not yet made sufficient progress to beable to report on management structure, which in anycase is partly dependent on Ministerial decisions about the National Freight Organisation.    It is oneof a number of matters on which we hope to haveUnion views early in the New Year.    Similarly we have notyet begun our assessment of the Board&apos;s investment programmes and the criteria for investment appraisal.Cooper Brothers have made certain preliminaryrecommendations about financial and budgetary controlprocedures, and the structure and role of the Board!headquarters Finance organisation, and the moreimportant are listed,  ^cessarily briefly, in Part Vof Annex A.2.9   We need only add that our aim has been to providethe gist of our recommendations as shortly aspossible and in the most readable form.   All our.detailed papers and the reports from the Consultants,are already available both in the Ministry and in theBoard.    In this Interim Report, therefore, we haveconfined ourselves to a statement of our main findingsand recommendations to date, with the minimum of supporting material.Section 3.    Methods of Calculating.Paying and controlling Subsidies for Unremunerative passenger service s3.1    We interpret the White Paper to mean that a subsidy ought to be payable wherever the Minister on broad, social and economic grounds decides to retain aparticular passenger service, the revenue reasonablyattainable from which, falls short of the properlyattributable   costs.3.2   The White Paper also refers in paragraph 27 to thepossibility that ldical authorities might assume some, atany rate, of the financial responsibility for suchpassenger services.   We know that this is underconsideration in the Ministry, but for the purposes of this/inxerim Report-5-
-6-Interim Report we have concentrated on the principles and methods to be adopted where the subsidies are paidby the Minister of Transporto   This does not imply that similar principles should not be adopted where the subsidies are to be paid by local or other authorities.3*3   We recommend that subsidies should be based on an assessment of net losses likely to be incurred over a future period of time, rather than on the basis of payment in arrears in respect of actual lossesincurred.   We make this recommendation because we believethat this will present a considerable inducement to theRailways to run their subsidised services as efficientlyas possible so as to reduce actual losses.    Furthermore ifsubsidies are paid on an estimated loss, this willconsiderably reduce the need for audited accounts ofeach service and the possibility of dispute aboutdetailed figures.    It should be possible to satisfyParliament that this   would be an acceptablesubstitute for payment on audited actual results, bearing that mind the incentive it offers to the Board to reducelosses on the subsidised services.3*h   We have concluded that once a subsidy has beenagreed in principle, it should, as far as possible,cover all the costs which the Board incur in respect ofthat service (including some part of joint costs) andwhich they are not able to recover from&apos;the receipts from the service.3.5   We recommend that terminal and track and signallingcosts incurred on facilities used only by subsidisedpassenger services should be charged to those services.3-6   vYe refer in paragraph 3 of Annex A to the furtherresearch which is to be undertaken to determine howcosts vary with the volume of traffic.    This will inevitably be a lengthy process but will help us tosee how far,  in respect of any of these unremunerativepassenger services, there are true &quot;joint costs&quot;,(defined by Cooper Brothers as those associated with thesituation where the production of one product enables theproduction of another to take place at no extra cost)(Annex A Part I Para. 2).    Costs which vary with outputshould certainly rank for subsidy.    It is arguable thattrue joint costs should remain the responsibility of theBoard but v/e do not accept this view because it would mean that, in practice, the Board&apos;s remunerative services would/have
have to carry the full joint costs and thus cross-subsidise the unremunerative.     Pending the completionof our studies into joint costs and the developmentof a more precise formula for calculating subsidies for individual passenger services, we intend toprepare total figures as a basis for examining theBoard1s general financial prospects.    For this purposewe propose to treat all costs (other thanadministration) as fully variable and apportion themto the services concerned on the basis used by theBoard for passenger profitability studies.3*7   As regards general administration costs, werecommend that it would be appropriate to allocate tothe subsidised services a proportion of those coststhat are properly attributable to passenger traffic.3*8   V;/e recommend that the subsidy payable should includedepreciation, and we further recommend that this shouldbe assessed on a replacement cost basis, and not onhistoric costs.    We also recommend that subsidies should include an allowance, on a basis which we hope todetermine in a later report, for the appropriateinterest charge on the assets used in providing theseunremunerative passenger services.3 = 9   v7e agree with the Cooper Brothers1 recommendation that it would be inappropriate,  in calculatingsubsidies, to take any account of contributory revenuealthough, in deciding whether a service should beretained, and subsidised, both the Board and theMinistry will no doubt have to take into account theamount of contributory revenue that may be at risk.Contributory revenue is the off-service revenue ofjourneys partly on and partly off a service.3*10 ;&apos;Ve regard it as important that the principles tobe adopted for the calculation of subsidies should be consistent with those adopted generally for costingwithin the railways,  as otherwise any arrangement would be open to misunderstandings and criticism.It does not follow that the financial accounts shouldaccord in all respects with the costing formulae;    inparticular, depreciation will be charged foraccounting purposes on the basis of historic costs.3.11 We recommend that three years should normally be theperiod for which subsidies should be fixed in advance.If the period is kept to three years, this will belong enough to provide an incentive, and short enough for7* /it not
it not normally to be necessary to include any provision for review of individual cases during that pgried.   If oosti rigs shove the is ruling .a&amp; thi.tiffliB whin thi sufeiidy ma fixad, than the Beard willhave to cope with these, and should not be able toask; for any increase in subsidy until the terminationof the three year period except in the circumstances described in 3*lh and 3*15*    The dates for review of subsidies for particular services should be staggeredto ease the administrative burden of assessment and review, and in order to set up this arrangementinitial subsidies may have to be paid for shorterperiods than three years in a proportion of cases.3*12 Requests for subsidies should be submitted service by service, by the Board.    In each case the board should submit to the Ministry sufficient details (see part II of Annex A) to show that the services arebeing operated efficiently and that all means of reducing costs, while providing an adequate standard ofservice, have been fully explored.    They should also givewhatever information they have of the demand-   for those services,  and the extent to which this demand will be met by the proposed service to enable theMinister to decide, in the light of all other relevant considerations, on the merits of the case for subsidy on broad social and economic grounds.   Where there is a major traffic reorganisation in contemplation,  inconurbations for example, additional information may need to be sought.3.13    -Me recommend that in addition to careful scrutiny of the Board&apos;s submissions, the Ministry should selectfor detailed review a sample from the cases submittedto them.    This review should not include a check ofthe calculations, but this would be done in a proportionof cases by an independent accountant who might be theBoard&apos;s auditors.3olh We recognise that for very large services,particularly in conurbations, it may be necessary toprovide for a review if circumstances changesignificantly during the three year period.3.15   The Minister must have control over the frequency and standard of service, and the maximumfares, on any subsidised service.   The Board should beentitled to ask for a review of the subsidy if there iso /an increase
CONFIDENTIAL -       ^ggan increase in the deficit on any service as a directresult of the exercise of the Minister&apos;s control.3.1 6 Furthermore, because any capital investment on sucha service will affect the future level of subsidy, theBoard should be required to refer to the Ministry for specific approval any proposed capital expenditure overa stated amount,  including any renewals, which is madein respect, or in partial respect, of a subsidisedservice.    If a subsidised service is withdrawn beforethe fixed assets have been fully depreciated, then theBoard will make a capital loss, and we are considering how this should be met (e.g. by writing off theunexpired balance against capital account).3.17 Subsidies should be paid by the Ministry to theBoard at ip-weekly intervals.    These    sums should be calculated as being l/l3th part of the annual agreedamount for each service,    $here the period fixed for a subsidy has come to an end, and a decision has notyet been taken by the Ministry as to whether thesubsidy should he renewed, at the same or any differentlevel, then pending such an agreement the subsidy shouldcontinue to be paid, at the previous level, with any necessary retrospective adjustment when the new subsidyis agreed.3.18 The Board should be required to give the overallestimated financial results, in respect of subsidisedpassenger services, in their Annual Report.    The time thatwould be required to ascertain these figures wouldprobably make it impossible to include audited figures in the Accounts.3.19     We think it reasonable that the Ministry should besupplied with figures, at agreed intervals, in respect ofeach subsidised service,  to show the extent to which theservice is being used.    These figures would not relate tothe financial results, but could take the form, forexample, of passenger counts.3.20     Once the Board has reached its target offinancial equilibrium, a general review of the financial,provisions dealt with in this section will be necessary.3.21      V/e suggest that as far as possible the legislativeprovisions should be widely drawn.    The essentials are -(a)    that the Minister should have power, inrespect of individual unremunerative servicesAD9
(i)    to decide that they should be continued on broad social and economic grounds,(ii)    to agree with the Board the level ofservice to be provided,(iii)    to decide on the level of subsidy tobe paid for a period of up to threeyears ahead,(iv)    to call for information about theextent to which such services are infact being used-(b)    that the Board,  in addition to supplying thedetails mentioned in paragraph 3*1 8,  shouldbe under an obligation to refer any proposalsfor major capital expenditure in respect ofany such service to the Minister.3.22     All the above recommendations relate to legis-lative proposals.    In the meantime, and as soon aspossible, v/e recommend that calculations on the basisset out in paragraph 3-3 should be carried out, that theMinistry should reach decisions on individual service as though subsidies were to be paid, and the amountsconcerned should be noted in the Annual Reports,  inorder that the extent to which the Board&apos;s deficitrelates to services which, for the future, will be specifically subsidised by the Ministry&apos;can be readilyseen.3-23     There remain certain other questions arising outof service withdrawals, which we have still to consider..The main one is how to cover the subventions to operators of bus services provided as.a condition of the with-drawal of rail services.Section h.   Financial Prospects terms of reference is to review the financial prospects ofthe Board in the light of current developments and thenew policies indicated in the White Paper.deficit, as viewed through their statutory accounts,will be of the order of  132 million.    We accept that apart of this results from the present national economicsituation, particularly as it affects the heavy industries, and but for this the Board are confident thatthey could by now have achieved a further reduction inthe deficit.    But it is useful to quote the presenth.1One of the most important tasks implicit in our+.2The Board estimate that their 1966 revenue10/figure
figure in order to show the scale of the problem.It has not yet been possible to assess thereduction in future deficits which will be broughtabout by Exchequer grants or by payment by other authorities in respect of specific loss makingpassenger services.    There may also be a case forother grants, e,g, for standby capacity,,    But it isclear that there will still be a gap - possibly alarge gap - between the total of the Board&apos;revenue, including these various subsidies, andtheir total costs.    It seems prudent at this early stage to draw attention to the existence of thisgap, and the need for some overall assessment of theearning capacity of the Board1s assets.k.3   It should also be borne in mind that the Board1acapital investment is continuing at the rate of over 100 million a year.    It is true that much of this isprovided out of current depreciation provisions andthe sale of surplus assets and to this extent doesnot add to the Board1s interest burden.    But thiscontinuing necessary investment is a factor whichadds to the importance of assessing the profitability of the railway activity rather than the reverse.h.h   The aim should be to attempt to view the wholeof the Board&apos;s business as it will be in future years in the light of the government&apos;s policies, taking account of future increases in efficiency, including those which should result from the present Review.We^are still considering how best to make a realisticassessment of the Board&apos;s future earning capacity in order to be able to report fully on this in our main report.    Whilst we have not yet decided ondetailed methods it seems likely that the review muststart from an appraisal of the Board&apos;s major trunkflows over the system as a whole, product by product.This should not be beyond the combined resources ofthe Board, the Ministry and Cooper Brothers.h.5   We shall also be considering whether any regionalstudies could usefully be undertaken in particular,in relation to our examination of standby capacity.h.6   Other studies which we are putting in hand andwhich are relevant relate to the potential revenues tobe obtained from train load traffics and to the viability of part of the wagon load traffic.    The/results
results of all these studies should be availablein time to assist in determining what provisions should be included in the Transport Bill about anyresidual deficit grant powers and about the Board&apos;scapital structure.Section 5     Main Report5.1 We intend to submit our main report during thecourse of the summer.Signed on behalf of the Joint Steering-GroupJOHN MORRISChairmanB. E. BARLOWSecretary10th January, 1967.12CONFIDENTIAL
ANNEX APart I.    Costing Principles and Methods1.     7e have had the benefit of a very full report fromCooper Brothers, which covers the whole of the ground in great detail,    vie have not yet been able to give it all the study which it needs, and, as set out below,in one important respect further research is neededbefore final conclusions can be reached.   But whilst they suggest that certain changes are desirable, their over-all conclusion is that the present costing principles and the ways in which they are applied are generallysound and that, at least on an interim basis, themethods now used to calculate movement costs for passenger profitability studies would be appropriate forsubsidy purposes.2.     The difficulties of railway costing arise mainly from joint costs (defined by Cooper Brothers as those associated with the situation where the production ofone product enables the production of another to takeplace at no extra cost) and fixed costs (those which donot vary with changes in the quantity produced).    in recognition of this problem, British Railways havedivided their operating costs into two oategories:-(a) Direct costs - which are considered to be bothvariable and specific (that is they can be attributed directly to the traffic conveyed);(b) Indirect costs (track and signalling andgeneral administration) - which are normallytreated as being both fixed and joint.3.     We agree with Cooper Brothers that it is necessary,if the classification of costs is to be improved, thatcosting research should be undertaken to determine(a) how, and on what time scale, costs vary with changes in either the volume of traffic orother measures of railway output;(b) what factors, other than output, affect thelevel of cost of each activity./It
It will be particularly important to ascertain how farcosts vary from the average.    In looking at thiscosting information we shall also need to consider howfar the various presentations of costs meet the needsof managers who have to use these figures,4.     Cooper Brothers have recommended that interestshould not be treated as a cost, hut should be recovered as iart of a &quot;profit contribution&quot;.    we accept that the present method of assessing interest,which involves allocating to certain assets the sumactually paid by the Board in interest at the present,is unsatisfactory.    We also accept that it should be distinguished from other costs.   But we do not thinkthat it is appropriate to think in terms of a profitcontribution for an industry which is not intendedto make profits, and which has such a long way to go before it can achieve equilibrium.    It will certainlycontinue to he financed through fixed interest capital and not equity shares.    In these circumstances, wethink that interest should be charged at a current-rate, and that as far as possible it should be assigned to specific items needed for particular operations.5.     Furthermore, we think that depreciation, forcosting and subsidy purposes, should continue to be assessed on a replacement cost basis, and not onhistoric costs.    This seems essential if the full costof operations Is to he taken into account, and if thoseassets of the railways which are to be retained are tobe kept in good order in perpetuity.S.     The present accounting and information systemsdo not provide the information required for costingpurposes, and it is necessary for the Traffic CostingService to ascertain costs either by analysis of the overall working results or by ad hoc studies.    Bothmethods hove considerable disadvantages, which wouldbe largely avoided if the budgets could be used forcosting purposes to the maximum extent possible.Cooper Brothers believe that it should increasinglybe possible to calculate from the budgets the total and/unit-1k-
unit costs for individual locations and track sections,distinguishing &quot;between short-term variable and long-term costs.    We are agreed that they should be askedto explore this in detail.-15-
Part II.   Methods for Minimising the Net Deficit onUnremunerative Passenger services.     P-E Consulting Group have carried out a review ofa number of the services which are currently running at a loss, and for which closure has been refused bythe Minister, or her predecessors.    Their main objectives were to consider possibilities for reducing costs (e.g. by reducing the amount of track,using conductor guards on trains, simplifying ofprotection arrangements at level crossings, etc.) andalso for increasing revenue (e.g. by adjustments offare levels and by providing the service best suited to the needs of the travelling public, having due regard to economy.)8.     The work done so far by P-S shows that, in respectof five services, all of which are largely rural intype, the loss at the time when closure   was refusedcould be substantially reduced.    Much of this reduction is attributable to steps which have eitherbeen taken, or are currently being planned, by british railways, but the Consultants made further suggestions which are now being considered by the Board.    Not all of these, of course, may be feasible.9.     The most immediate task which is now being pursued by the Consultants is the preparation of a form ofquestionnaire, all or part of which, depending oncircumstances, would need to be completed by theBritish Railways Board before an application forsubsidy is made and which could then serve as theactual application form for such a subsidy.   Apartfrom details of the current service and patronage,this form would include whatever/information wasreadily available on potential demand and any .proposed alteration in service.    Under standardheadings relating to means for increasing revenue orreducing cost the Board would indicate that consideration had been given to all practicable meansof reducing net loss and would estimate the financialresult achievable during the subsidy period.    We have/still-16-CONF1DE confidential 
still to consider whether this form, which would involvethe Board in a certain amount of discussion with localauthorities and G-overnment Departments, would provide sufficient information about social need, or whether further specific enquiries may he necessary in somecases. have also still to consider what partshould be played in the consideration of theseapplications by bodies such as the Transport UsersConsultative Committees.10.    further assessments are now being carried out bythe Consultants, primarily in order to check their proposals for the drawing up of such a questionnaire, endalso to enable them to see how far their procedures are appropriate for the more densely used services inconurbations.   V9e have asked them to give particular attention to the identification of those factors which affect costs and revenue, and an evaluation of theextent to which these costs may be variable indifferent circumstances.11.    Cne immediate recommendation, which results fromthe work by Consultants, and which we think should bebrought to your e, rly attention concerns services whichore currently proposed for closure,   at present, theBritish Railways Board feel themselves inhibited, once aproposal for closure has been published., under Section 56of the 1962 Act, from making any changes which alter thecharacter of a service even although considerablesavings in cost may be possible.    (It is important tobear in mind that the publication of proposals has a major impact on public opinion and there is a real danger that, if aiscussions are protracted, existing and potential customers may be irretrievably lost).   Werecommend the Minister and the Chairman to considerwhether the Board should submit specific proposals tothe Ministry in those esses where sensible changes can bemade which would substantially reduce costs.   The minister would then have to take a decision in the light of an assessment of likely public reaction./PART III.-17-
PaRT III.    Standby Capacit12.   This concept is specifically included in our termsof reference, and v/e have set up e. special Committee to study it in detail.   We are agreed that we are concerned only with standby capacity in infrastructure (i.e,sformation, track and signalling, etc.,) and not with anystandby in terminals, depots or wagons ana carriages.We are also agreed that the real question is how far, if at all, will the proposed future railway network, as nowbroadly agreed between the Minister and the Chairman ofthe Board, contain &quot;standby&quot; capacity which is additional to that required (a) on commercial grounds, and (b) forthe social services.   In other words, and this seems tothe Group a most important point to emphasise, we arelooking for surplus which is additional to that which anytransport undertaking needs for sound commercial reasons(e.g. to cope with predictable peaks or to assistoperational efficiency).   We are ^lso aiming to identify the nature of such surplus, why it exists, and, if anypart of: it is likely to persist, the reasons why.13.   The Committee has not yet reached any firmconclusions, and there is little that v/e can report in the interim.    But the subject must be mentioned at this time,since it could, inter alia, have a bearing on the socialsubsidies in certain circumstancess  (if, for example, apart of tr..ck costs were coveredby 2 grant for standbyona the loss on the subsidised service thereby reduced).Ik.    In their reijort on costing, Cooper Brothers recommendthat in order to calculate unit costs for - location, theactual costs for a period should be divided not by theactual volume of output likely to be achieved during thatperiod but by what they call &quot;the normal&apos;&apos; volume of output i.e., the reasonable output which could beachieved on a regular basis in that location if the traffic were available.    (This, according to therecommendation, would not apply to track and signalling,where the expected level of output should be used).   Tothe extent that the costs which might be recovered onthat basis would be les&amp; than the actual costs, becausethe traffic flowing was less than the potential traffic/which-18-
which could flow without further cost, this would heattributable to the surplus capacity inherent in thatlocution and the accounts would show the size of thesurplus.   This ana other possible alternative approaches to the cost of the surplus in the infrastructure and itsrelevance to the &quot;standby&quot;  question will require further exploration.-19-CONFIDENTSAL
Pi-.RT IV.    Other Ob lip; at ions derivinp; from the -past15.   We have already said that joint Teams were set upto look at the various obligations, deriving from thepast, which rest on the Board at present.Road Bridges and level Crossings16.   The total cost of over line bridges in 1y65 was 1,506,000, of which some  900,000 was to revenue account, and. therefore an addition to the deficit.l&apos;or the 2-1 years up to i960, the Ministry had agreed topay the Railways some  2m. per year towards the cost of road bridges and level crossings, because of the extentto which this    had been inflated by the growth in road traffic.   The payment was stopped in i960, because it was thought administratively more convenient to deal withthis through the revenue deficit.    In addition to theabove figures the Board pay  h0,000 per ,;nnum to theMinistry in respect of their relief from liability forthe trunk ro .d bridges which were transferred to theMinister in lyhb.   They also have to find about 327,000 per annum for the road surfaces of bridges.As regards protected level crossings over public roads,of which there are some 2,800 at present, their totalcost in 1965 was just under  1-^m.17.   The present statutory framework of responsibilityfor bridges and level crossings is obviously complicated and unsatisfactory.   The main disadvantages are thatthere is a lack of clearly defined obligations, greatadministrative complexity, failure to reach satisfactorystandards of provision, and administrative difficultieswhich often prevent the removal of bridges which areno longer necessary.   In these circumstances the JointTeam recommended that there would be much to be said forthe transfer of responsibility for public overlinebridges to County Councils and County Borough Councils.18.   The Team thought, however, that, at least for thetime being, there should be no attempt to transfer anypart of the responsibility for level crossings.   The risein costs is mainly due to the increase in railway wages,/not to20
not to an increase in road traffic, and localauthorities would have no effective control over thelevel of costs,   furthermore the legal provisionsgoverning the powers of local authorities to contribute to modernisation costs are extremely complex, and negotiations would be extremely difficult.19.   Whilst in principle we agree with the recommendation that it would be more appropriate for the costs of publicoverline bridges to be borne by local authorities, thereare considerable difficulties about ^ complete transferof responsibility for these bridges.   In particular theremust be some doubt whether local authorities would beable to maintain sufficiently high inspection standards,taid there would be difficulties about arranging for inspection, and work, to be done with safety, for railwayoperations and for loci authority personnel.   1 e do notthink that these practical difficulties have yet been sufficiently explored, and we have asked the Team togive further consideration to them.20.   pensions the problems in this field are more difficult.    Themain questions to resolve are whether, and if so how far,the hoard should be relieved of superannuation endpension liabilities relating to st ff previously employedon social or abandoned lines, and its obligations whichresult from decisions of the hoard1s predecessors. -There is also the problem of the interest burden onsuperannuation and pension fund deposits end provisions which are no longer represented by any viable assets.   Werealise that in facing these issues we are v siting whethertbe Board should, in effect, be regarded as a new body,starting afresh from a current date, with only the liabilities that they choose to impose on themselves forthe future, or whether it is right that they should besaddled with some part at least of the leg- cy of the past.21.   If the arguments for releasing the Board from itsobligation should be accepted, in full this might representa sum of the order of  15m. to  20m. per year.    to relieve the Board of a sum of this size would, however, be/a most21
1 Q olada most unfortunate precedent for other industries in asimilar position.22.   We have decided that this is an issue which wecannot tackle on its own, aid that we shall have to deferany positive recommendation to you until we can see the likely financial prospects for the board as a whole.23.   huseums and historical Recordsvie are satisfied that the Transport Luseums have a useful scientific, educational .jid cultural role to play.The Joint Team think that the greater part of theexhibits in them should be preserved, and we considerthat provision for the future of such exhibits ,,s arepreserved should be such as to assure their continuingdevelopment.24.   The Department of Education and. Science would be willing to assume responsibility for the Transporthuseums (which they would administer as satellites ofthe Science Museum) if the early rehousing of theClaphc..m exhibits in more suitable premises could be assured.   There may be difficulty in finding a newmore suitable site, and no final decision can be taken until a site has been found, and the costs evaluated.Furthermore, at that stage, it will be necessary toconsider whether the Department of auucation and science&apos;are prepared to continue the present B.R. policyof charging for entrance, as any change in this would havea material effect on the cost of the proposed transfer,but in principle we are agreed tnat a transfer to that department would be sensible, that a move from Claphamis in any case desirable, and. we would hope that the sole by the board of the Clapham site would provide themwith sufficient funds to enable them to provide betteraccommodation for the transport collections beforehanding over responsibility for them to the Department ofEducation and Science.25.   ^-s regards the historic.! Records, we are satisfiedthat they are of no va!ue to the board in running their business, but we accept that the bulk of them meritpreservation on grounds of general educational usefulness/and as22
and as illustrating an aspect of social history.   Wethink there may he some scope for reduction in the amountspent on preserving the records, by centralising theEnglish records in one building, but we accept thatthey are not suitable for inclusion in the Public RecordOffice.26.    If the Department of Education and Science takeover the museums, then we recommend that the opportunity should be taken to house the records on the same site asthe transport exhibits.   We think there would be much tobe said for this on educational, administrative andfin. .nci. 1 grounds,, ana this would be acceptable to theDepartment of Education and Science.27.   The British -Railways Board are now, as a matter of urgency, looking for a possible new site for themuseums and historical records.Railways Savinas Banks26.   as a first step, we have looked at the trend ofdeposits over recent years.   Deposits fell by  2.9m,,from 1963 to 1965.   They fell by a further  2.7m. inthe first six months of 1966 to  37.3m.   Por the whole period 1959 to 1965 withdrawals exceeded new deposits tothe extent of  lorn.   After crediting interest totalling 13m. the fall in total deposits amounts to a little over 3m.29.   The Team&apos;s researches show that the costs ofadministration would not diminish in proportion to thereduction in the total amount of deposits.   Equallyadministrative costs would not be affected to any majorextent by an increase of the order of 15 to 20% in thenumber of accounts   deposited, and now that much of the calculation is done by computer, computer costs would notbe materially affected by an increase of up to l+OJo.30.   These circumstances provide strong arguments why theRailways should try to increase the present size ofdeposits.   Furthermore, and of e^ual importance, they area source of relatively cheap capital for the Railways aswell ;/:s an incentive to savings amongst Railway staff.23
31.   In these circumstances we recommend:(1)   That the existing basis of operation of theRailways Savings Banks is left basicallyunchanged.(2)   That positive steps be taken by the Board toencourage an increase in membership of theBonks and of the extended use of payrolldeductions as a regular means of savings.(3)    That the interest rate payable on depositsshould be adjusted to bring the bank into line with other comparable bunks.(h)    That in addition to Railways Board employees,employees of a National Freight organisation should in future be eligible as depositors inc..n enlarged &quot;Transport&quot; Savings Bunk.Transport Police32.   It appears that the services of the Transport Policemay be regarded as falling into three distinguishable(but not exclusive) categories:(a)    The protection of property in which are33.   The Railways Board have claimed that some element of grant for both (b) and (c) above would be justified.   Theyhave emphasised that ne :.rly 20% of the Transport police are in the CID and without them crimes on the railways would merely be reported to the Civil Police Forces for investigation \)j them.   The Transport Police CID thus(c)(b)included the Safeguarding of the premises and.property of the Board, -and of goods in transit andthe property of travellers. ,This is clearly the sole responsibility of the Board.The detection of crimes which is mainly a function of the Criminal InvestigationDepartment (GID) .General public ser ices, such as the control oftraffic in tae vicinity of main railwaystations, the marshalling of crowds, generalhelp to members of the public and the maintenanceof public order./provide2h
provide relief for the Civil Police Forces, and alsorender direct assistance, for example, in 136 5 by makingabout 72 5 arrests.    Furthermore they are.able to copebetter in circumstances where knowledge of transportoperations is essential.   As regards services for thegeneral public, some 2kk of the Transport Police areemployed in this field much of which is common with thatcovered by the Civil Police (e.g. control of immigration).3k.    On the other hand, it con be argued that theRailways provide a police force largely for soundcommercial reasons, and that their public image, and thecost or losses, would be materially effected by any reduction of their police activities.35.   Our study of this item is still continuing.25
Part V&quot;.    Financial and Budgetary Control Procedures36.    Cooper Brothers have had a preliminary look at thebudgeting and management information systems of british railways, and have given us certain preliminaryconclusions, which are sufficiently important todeserve some mention in this Interim Report.    It isalso right to record their view, with which we entirelyagree, that in view of the fact that the presentprocedures were introduced only three to four years agogreat strides have already been made by the Board.37.    Cooper Brothers&apos; preliminary recommendations areas follows:(i) As far as practicable &quot;responsibility&quot;budgeting should be extended so that individualarea and depot managers within a division maybe involved in the budgeting process,(ii) There should be a greater degree ofco-ordination between the:(a) budgeted sales in terms of both receipts and volume of activity;(b) estimated physical resources required to achieve the expected sales;    and(c) expenditure budgets which should representthe cost of providing the resourcesrequired.(iii) There should be an analysis of the differences between budgeted and actual results for activities or locations in order to showseparately the effects of:(a) differences between the actual level of output and that envisaged in the budgets;(h) changes which are outside the control ofthe manager concerned;    and over or underspending for which the manager is responsible.(iv) In order to compare actual expenditure incurredwith the expenditure which should have been incurred for the level of output actuallyachieved, it will be necessary to divide costsbetween those that may be expected to:/(a)26
(a) vary within the budget period, with changes in the level of output;(b) remain unchanged, at least during thebudget period.If this attempt is made to determine thevariable elements of the costs of activities,and if budgeting is extended to individuallocations, then it would be possible to makegreater use of the budgets for costingpurposes.(v) They entirely support the philosophyunderlying the developments in managementcontrol information proposed in the Board&apos;soverall plan of September 1964.    The principleof comparing the value (in terms of standardallowances) of output produced with the costof the resources used in its production should however be extended to otheractivit ies.(vi) They regard it as important that the controlinformation systems now being planned shouldbe designed to be integrated to the maximum extent possible with the budgetary control system.    In turn, this integrated budgetarycontrol/management information system should,as far as possible, be designed to meet therequirements of the traffic costing serviceand, thereby reduce the need for ad-hoc samplestudies to ascertain the costs of individualactivities.(vii) Cooper Brothers have finally recommended somestrengthening of the Railways HeadquartersFinance organisation, and greater centraldirection.38.    7e have not yet been able to take a final view on these recommendations, and indeed over much of thefield it would be dangerous for us to attempt to do sobefore we have a further report from the Consultants.7e are ensuring that they, in consultation with the/Board27
Board, carry out a detailed investigation of the steps that would he required to carry into effect those oftheir outline recommendations which we decide to accept,the advantages that this would provide for managerialdecision-making, and the cost.    V/e will report furtherwhen this work has been carried out.    We are alsoasking them to look at all the variations in procedurebetween and within regions, and to recommend how far greater uniformity of practice may be desirable.28
C Q NIP i n P WTIAIv.vl*iriUCIN I IMLANNEX BTerms of Reference for the Joint review o      The Government has reached the conclusion that forthe foreseeable future there will he a need, as part ofthe country&apos;s transport system, for a substantialrailway network.      In order to restore    stability to an industry which has been the subject of continual change and uncertainty, and to enable management and staff to concentrate on the development of the system in theinterests of the public and of trade and industry, theGovernment has decided that the basic size of therailway network should be determined now.     It will consist primarily of routes linking the main centres of population and of industry and commerce, with additionalroutes to serve major freight traffic flows and toprovide essential passenger services for commuters andothers.     There are still some lines, services andstations whose retention in modern conditions can nolonger be justified, and their future will be decidedunder the usual procedure as soon as possible to avoidprolonging uncertainty,2.      The Government and the Railways Board are determined that this stabilised rail system shall play a full partin the transport system of the country and do so withrapidly increasing economic efficiency.      Capital willbe provided for the replacement of rolling stock and the modernisation of traction systems and of track andsignalling wherever this can be justified in economicterms.     Investment will be concentrated on the maintrunk routes carrying heavy flows of traffic, but otherfeeder and commuter lines will also be adapted to modernneeds.3.     The social and other considerations which have ledto the decision to stabilise the rail network also makeit necessary to substitute a new financial framework forthat imposed by the Transport Act, 1962.     It has become clear that the requirement contained in the Act for theBoard to &quot;pay its way&quot; by the beginning of 1968 is/entirely-29-
entirely unrealistic and would, if pursued, force it into action which in many cases would be against theinterests of the community and inconsistent with the plans for transport and other services which theGovernment is developing.     It must therefore heamended to provide more realistic and appropriatefinancial objectives and a new financial framework and discipline.Jr.     Against this background the Minister of transport and. the Chairman of the Railways Board have agreed toundertake a review of certain aspects of the railwayindustry.     For this purpose they have set up a -JointSteering Group under the chairmanship of the joint parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Transport.5.     The Joint Steering Group will be assisted by an expert working party, consisting as necessary of independent accountancy and management consultants and including economists from the Ministry&apos;s new DirectorateGeneral of Economic Planning and- by a number of jointMinistry/Railways Board teams investigating particularsubjects.     The tfcerms of reference of the review as awhole will be as follows:(a) To establish an acceptable basis for costingand to identify those categories of services(both passenger and freight) which are notcovering costs;    to isolate those categorieswhich are potentially viable;    to examine theremaining loss-makers and to isolate those with no prospects of becoming viable;    and to costin detail the annual loss on each passenger service which is unlikely ever to becomeviable so that the Government can decide whether it should be grant-aided on broadsocial and economic grounds;(b) to consider any steps in the field of pricing policy or elsewhere which may be necessary toimprove the prospects of those services whichare already remunerative and those which arepotentially viable;/(c)-30-
(c) to examine the Board&apos;s methods of costing andfinancial control in the light particularly of the new proposals for meeting the cost of essential but unremunerative services and ofother changes proposed in the White Paper;(d) to assess whether and, if so, to what extent the cost of the railway infrastructureincludes an element of &quot;standby capacity&apos;;(e) to examine the Board&apos;s investment programmes and the criteria for investment appraisal;(f) to examine the continuing obligationsderiving from the past which rest on theBoard, including those in respect of roadbridges and level-crossings, of super-annuation and pensions for past and presentemployees, and of the British Transport police force;(g) to consider the suitability of the Board&apos;smanagement structure and procedures for thefuture operation of the system in the lightof the contents of the White Paper and the changes which may stem therefrom;(h) to make consequential recommendations,including suggestions for possiblelegislative changes;and to report to the Minister of Transport and theChairman of the Railways Board accordingly,,-31-
