US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)65C(67) 140 COPY NO.25th July, 1967CABINETWATER7/&quot;AYS POLICY:   USE OF THE BRITISH WATERWAYSBQARD&apos;S WATERWAYS FOR RECREATION AND AMENITYMemorandum by the minister of TransportOur White Paper on Transport Policy (Cmnd. 3057) set out our proposals for the future of the waterways owned by the British WaterwaysBoard (BW3).    We undertook to consult local authorities and a wide range of other interests concerned about the preservation of a network ofwaterways for pleasure cruising,    I now propose to publish a white paper setting out the results of this consultation and our proposals about the future pleasure cruising network and about other recreationaland amenity uses of the waterways.2.       The Home Affairs Committee have approved the draft white paper, subject to minor amendments, and invited rne to circulate a revised draft to the Cabinet for information.     The attached draft takes account of the points made by the Committee.3.       I would propose to publish the White Paper in the first part ofSeptember at the same time as the BW3 publish an illustrated bookleton the amenity use of the waterways.   The two publications willcomplement each other and will, I hope, enable me, jointly withthe BWB, to give the new waterways policy a good send-off.B.A. C.Ministry of Transport, S.E.1.25th July, 1967
BRITISH :/,M,,R&apos; .AY8-. ,a;CE , WTIQK D^D jaWW TfYInt^oj^PJfcion1.     The Governments general plan for the future structure ofBritish Waterways was announced in last year&apos;s White Paper on transport Policy (Cmnd.3057 Chapter VIII).    It was based on the broad factual analysis in the British Waterways Board&apos;s report;,The Pacts about the Waterways&apos;&apos;&apos;.    In the interests of safety,efficiency and economy the whole system of nationalised inland waterways is to remain under the single management of the Board.Those canals and river navigations which can form an economictransport undertaking together with such allied facilities asdocks and warehouses will be operated by the Board as a commercialdivision of their undertaking.    The non-commercial waterways areto be managed, separately for amenity and other purposes.2.     Earlier last year in the White Paper on &quot;Leisure in the countryside&apos;1  (cmnd..2923) special attention was drawn to thenation&apos;s considerable potential for all kinds of recreation inthe extensive network of inland waterways in England and   ales.It was recognised, that to cater for pleasure cruising on thesewaterways continued subsidy would be needed and those who use the waterways for recreation would, have to show which facilitiesthey wanted to support.The Gpy errm entjs^ Caonsultat ions3.     The Government&apos;s immediate task, since the publication ofGnuid.3057 has been to discuss, as promised., with all the interested bodies what sort of waterways network, and how big anetwork, it would, be justified in maintaining for use by pleasureboats.   The inescapable fact here is that whatever is done withthem the2 /non-commercial
REST21non-commercial waterways will cost the taxpayer at least 600,000% year&apos; .   And to keep open for pleasure cruising all thenon-commercial waterways now available for that purpose would cost a further W3i;.0,C00.* This was made clear in &quot; he Facts aboutthe Waterways&quot;-   But another important fact is that if a waterwayis no longer maintained for navigation and works are carried outwhich make no allowance for the passage of boats, then the costof eventual restoration can become prohibitive.    The Governmentsaid in Cmnd. 3057 that they thought it wrong to allow this to happen to those waterways which seem likely to have a valuablepart to play in providing for the country&apos;s future leisure needs.Throughout the discussions that have been going on this has been the guiding princ principle.k.   The Government&apos;s consultations over the last twelve months have been conducted in close collaboration with the BritishWaterways Board.    The consultations have been extensive andexhaustive.    Any organisation likely to be interested in therecreational ana amenity potential of the waterways has been invited to put its views forward.   Almost all have done so andthose consulted range from Regional Economic Planning Councils,Sports Councils, local authori ;ies, trade associations and national societies to local clubs,   as well as all this manyhundreds of individuals have responded, to the Minister ofTransport&apos;s request for comments and ideas.    Wany of the suggestions received were about details of day to day management of the waterways ana these are now being considered by the Board.2.Round figures, 1965 prices./5.
5. The central issue in the consultations was of course the siaeof the pleasure cruising network to be retained.   Paid here opinion was predictably unanimous.   The clear consensus among all the interested organisations is that, first, apart from some pruning ofdisused arms and lengths of canal here and there, all the waterwaysnow open for powered pleasure cruising should remain open.    great stress was laid on the need to retain waterways forming part ofthrough or ring routes and it has been urged that it would be wrong to close any navigable routes to pleasure craft at a time whenincreasing leisure and a rising standard of living are likely toput- all our facilities for recreation at a premium.    Second, thegreat majority of those consulted think that to review the networkat the end of five years and at intervals thereafter (as proposedin Cmnd. 3057) would discourage private commercial investment anddevelopment by making the future of individual waterways uncertain.xiiir.dly., it was strongly represented that some waterways not nownavigable should be restored for pleasure cruising.6.     The Government has given all these arguments very carefulconsideration and weighed them against the limitations of thecountry&apos;s financial resources.&apos;k I-etwork of ^&quot;Cjrui^ewaysJ^7.      -Pleasure cruising on inland waterways and. rivers is no longer apastime within reach only of the well to do.    The Government welcomesthis and believes that in the next few years more and more people will want to use and. be able to afford to use the waterways for sparetime relaxation and quiet holidays.    Therefore, the government intend, at the outset, to retain for pleasure cruising substantially the existing network available for this purpose.   The Britishaterways Board will be given the new and positive duty ofmaintaining these waterways to a standard of navigability suitable/for.
G3J.Droj.S3H220for powered pleasure craft.    It is thus the Government&apos;s intention that for the first time, this recreational purpose of the nationalised waterways should he recognised by public Act ofParliament,8.     The Government propose that forthcoming legislation shouldmake special,provision for two distinct groups of waterways.    Thofirst will be those which are to form part of the Board&apos;commercial division.    The waterways in this category are listed in Appendix A.    These waterways will be maintained primarily for commercial transport and will not be formally classed as part ofthe cruising network, but, of course, pleasure craft will stillbe able to use them as they do no?;.    The second kind ofwaterway (those listed in Appendix B) will be maintained primarily for powered pleasure craft.    They can no longer usefully form partof a commercial transport system and they will be known as cruisingwaterways - or &quot;cruiseways&quot;.9.      There are a number of waterways not included in either ofthese groups which will need individual study and consideration before their future can be settled,    Some of these waterways arestill navigable either wholly or in part and the Board will begiven discretion to allow vessels to use them or any parts ofthem subject to whatever conditions may be necessary.    An exampleis the Birmingham area where the &quot;cruiseways&quot; will include asingle through route giving connections to the rest of the system in all directions.    The rest of the complex known as the birmingham Canal Navigations will not be classed as cruisingwaterways.    But the Board may continue to/allow4.Q313raXS3^
allow boats to use some or all of them - several are importantsources of industrial water supply - until their future can bedetermined in the light of detailed and expert studies.10.    The effect of all these arrangements is that well over 1,300miles of waterways will remain open for pleasure cruising.    All thelong distance through   routes and circuits now enjoyed by inlandwaterway enthusiasts will still be available.    The British  WaterwaysBoard are issuing a new illustrated booklet to publicise the variedcharm and attractions of the &quot;cruiseways&quot; and the navigable riverswhich link with them.The future Security of the System11 .   Cmncl. 3057 said that the Government would review the whole ofthe cruising network after five years and thereafter at regular intervals.    It is not now proposed to institute a formal review ofthis kind either at the end of five years or at other set intervals.The reason for this decision is that the Government recognises thatuncertainty about the future of a waterway might deter prospectiveprivate investors and so hinder a waterway&apos;s development for recreational-tion, e.g. by the building of marinas or the provision of cruisingcraft for hire.12.   But the Government will initially have to make a substantial grant-in-aid so as to enable the Board to maintain such an extensive network of cruising waterways.    Obviously the funds available for this are not/unlimited5.
unlimited and the grant, like any other Exchequer subsidy, willhave to he kept under review as part of the normal process ofnational housekeeping.    What this means is that the future ofthe cruising network must depend very largely on how far peopletake the opportunities for leisure and recreation which it offers.The Board will naturally do everything it can to promote thenetwork1s use by the public and to maximise the revenuederived from this use.13.    There must, however, he suitable machinery for the closure of a waterway if this becomes necessary in thenational interest.    Equally it must he possible to add to thecruising network if this proves the right thing to do.    all who may be concerned in any such moves must have their interests safeguarded.    In all these matters the minister will have the advice of a new permanent consultative body (see para-graph 14- below).   But, as wo 11 ao this, the forthcoiaing legislation will   enable her to publish a proposal for, say, transferringa waterway from the commercial to the cruising category or foradding a restored waterway to the network by means of a draftstatutory instrument.    It will be possible to lodge objectionsto the draft instrument and the Minister will have, power tohold a public enquiry if she thinks fit.    If in the end theMinister decides to make an order it can still he annulled bya resolution of either House of Parliament.    Under this proce-dure there can he no sudden or arbitrary closures.Consultative Machinery14-    One of the outstanding features of the discussions theGovernment has had over the last twelve months about the futureof the nationalised waterways has been the many constructiveideas put forward by the voluntary bodies and individuals whoknow and love the waterways.    The Government wants to encouragethis kind of thinking and to see that it is, whenever possible,6. /Put
put to practical use.    The Government, therefore, intend toset up as soon as possible and before the forthcoming legislation is introduced a standing Inland Waterways Advisory Council.    TheBill will provide for this to become a permanent statutory body.Its Chairman will be a member of the British Waterways Boardand the other members of the Council will be appointed by theMinister for their personal qualities and qualifications.15.    The functions of the Council will be broadly to advise theBoard and the Minister on any proposals to add to or reduce thecruising waterways (including, of course, proposals forrestoration);    to consider any complaint about persistent failure by the Board to maintain a significant length of a cruisingwaterway in a suitable condition for use by pleasure craft;    and generally to consider and make recommendations to the Board orthe Minister about the use or development of the cruisingwaterways for amenity or recreation and about services orfacilities provided on them.    The Council will be able to considermatters of this kind at the request of the Board or the Minister,or on representations that may be made to thom&apos;&apos;by outsidepersons, or on their own initiative.Re si oration - Shheme s16.    In recent years voluntary societies have.put forward, anumber of schemes for restoring lengths of disused canal to navigation.    Many of these schemes are highly attractive becausethey would re-open waterways running through lovely countryside.On the other hand the capital cost of such schemes can be very high and each restoration, when carried out, brings in its traina new and continuing liability for maintenance.    Despite this the Government is keen to encourage volunteer efforts to develop the amenity network of waterways.    One of the main jobs of theAdvisory Council will be to examine the merits of all proposedrestoration schemes in consultation with the British Waterways/Board
Board and any local authorities which may he concerned.    in doing this the Council will pay special attention to the needfor realistic estimates of capital and continuing costs and itwill take account of any financial aid likely to he available and the prospects of revenue to ho gained from the ro-openedwaterway.Help from IiOcal Autjiortticss17.    Many forward-looking planning authorities, notably theGreater London Council and the canalside London Boroughs, havebean showing active interest in the potentialities of the waterways for local amenity and recreation.    It is already opento them to further this end in a variety of ways, e.g. by giving assistance, under the Physical Training and RecreationActs, in the provision of facilities for clubs, by using their powers under the Public Health Acts to develop parks andpleasure grounds for recreational purposes or by the creationand maintenance of public walks along towing-paths.18,    The Government will he prepared to consider any expansion ofexisting powers which the local authority associations may haveto propose in this connection.Angling, Canoeing and other interests19.    Cruising in boats is by no means the only form of recreationon the waterways.    Coarse fishing, a sport enjoyed by many peopleyoung and old, some of very modest means, has been popular onthe canals for many years and the interests of anglers must not he overlooked.    Canoeing is becoming increasingly popular withthe younger generation.    Some of    the waterways are of great interest to naturalists.    There is a clear risk of conflict hereunless all waterway-users exercise mutual consideration.    Allthese interests will he taken into account in planning the futureof the amenity waterways and the Minister will have this great variety of interests in mind when making appointments to theAdvisory Council. yA
A rKelL. i^iajytgJ1.&apos;- JToj^ifoe^aJ; e r w ays20.    In the waterways this country possesses a priceless asset,an asset whose value will grow as the demand for leisurefacilities intensifies.    The Government now intend the BritishWaterways Board to have a new and positive role to play in thedevelopment of this potential, recognized by statute for thefirst time.    This is In effect a new charter for the waterways.But to get the most out of this charter legislation and official action will not he enough.    The Government is confident that many thousands of ordinary people will welcome its plans and it looks to all those who enjoy the waterways to help inseeing that they are fully, Imaginatively and adventurously used as the great amenity network they are.
