;DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S GOVERNMENT)C(67) 127 COPY NO.  4___10th July, 1967CABINETROAD HAULAGE policy memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIn C(67) 122 the Minister of Transport presents her proposalsfor a new system of licensing heavy lorries, including those of &quot;own account&quot; operators,    I feel bo\ind to state briefly why I am convincedon the evidence so far presented that these proposals would beinjurious to productive industry and to the national interest,2.      There is, of course, no dispute about the ministers objective of using the new facilities of British Railways to the best advantage.On the other hand it is also common ground that British industry needs to place a new emphasis on every aspect of distribution and marketing.It came out clearly at the Prime Ministers Conference in June thatspeed and flexibility in delivery and distribution were crucial in thisrespect, particularly for exports.    Another vital public interest isthe attraction of new industry to Scotland, Wales and other development areas, and. this is very dependent on managements1 being convinced thatdifferent parts of productive processes which are geographicallyseparated can be geared together conveniently and flexibly.     I havefrequently found the desire to have its own internal transport under itsown control is crucial in a firmrs decision whether or not to set up in a development Area.3.      The essence of the Ministers proposals for &quot;quantity licensing&quot;is that, over and above the freight traffic that the railways will attract by their sheer competitive advantage, an additional volume oftraffic should be diverted to them by refusing licences to road hauliers.Where the railways object to licence applications, the onus will be onthe hauliers to convince the licensing authorities that considerations ofspeed, reliability and cost justify the use of road transport.4.      It has been calculated that the traffic diverted to the railways in this way may reduce the railways&apos; deficit by   6 million or, say4 per cent.     This saving would be worth having.    But, in my judgment,the issue is whether the inevitable imperfections of any licensingprocess will not result in costs to British industry outweighing thisadvantage.    I am strongly in favour of the railways whining back allpossible traffic?  but it should be done, not by restrictive compulsion,but by the railways attracting custom by efficiency and reliability,as we would expect any other public or private enterprise to do.-1.
5.     It also seems to me that the licensing authorities will face atask of  great complexity.    In two long discussions in the ministerial committee on Economic Policy (EN) and subsequent meetings between officials, the departments concerned with industrial efficiency have sought to elucidate how the authorities would deal with importantdifficulties.    Some of the main ones were set out in EN(67) 48.    Forexample, how would the authorities quantify the value to be attachedto the ability of road vehicles to meet the demand for journeys, atirregular times and at short notice, or to plan round trips withdeviations from the main freightliner routes with provision for delivery of part-loads and Maackloadmg&apos; ?   More generally, will it be possiblefor them to attribute a precise cost/benefit to factors such as the flexibility and timing which control of his own fleet gives an &quot;own account&quot; operator, or to allocate overhead costs of hauliers to particular operations in a way that will provide a true cost comparison between road and rail?6.      These judgments will often involve assessing not only theeconomics of the road hauliers&apos; business but the economics of theircustomers1 business as well.    While it may be true at present thatsome road hauliers and their customers are insufficiently aware of theadvantages that the railways offer for some types of traffic, it is a bigjump to say that the licensing authorities will in general be competent to make sounder judgments than the businessman about the costs and efficiency of an important aspect of his business.7.      In answer to these points the Ministry of Transport have ineffect said no more than that the fears expressed are exaggerated andthat the licensing authorities can be relied upon to deal with thesematters with wisdom and discretion.     Paragraph 6 of Annex D to theMinisters1 paper, however, shows clearly that, after detailed examination, the main doubts of the other Departments concerned have not been resolved.    For this reason I cannot accept that the risks of going ahead on the lines proposed are justified by the advantage tothe railways, nor that the railways could not be helped to market theirproduct in some less costly and cumbersome way.8.     In addition,   industry, and exporting industry in particular,are not simply concerned with cost comparison.    Tney are equallyconcerned in many cases with reliability, regularity of transport andthe maintenance of delivery dates.     There has been too much genuineexperience of delays on the railways for many firms to be willing toallow their transport arrangements to be outside their own control:and the Minister of Transports proposals are therefore likely to provoke a loud and sincere outcry from a wide section of industry,i. e, they will be represented with some reason as running counter to much of the Government^ advice to industry on efficiency, themovement of exports, delivery dates etc.9.     It would be far wiser, in my view, to help the railways to winback traffic by showing that their own performance justifies it, and thereby to winning their customers1 confidence.D. P. T. J.Board of Trade, S. W. 1.10th July, 1967
