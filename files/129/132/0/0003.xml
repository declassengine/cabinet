C(67) 123 COPY NO.   U &apos;&amp;7th July, 1967ARAB ATTITUDES AND BRITISH ECONOMIC INTERESTSIN THE MIDDLE EAST    &quot;Memorandum by the Secretary of State  or Foreign affairs at our meeting on 20th June (CC(67) 40th Conclusions, Minute 2),I was invited to circulate a memorandum assessing the manner in whichthe attitude of the Arab countries to the supply of oil to this country might develop and the consequences for our economic interests.2.       The assessments in this paper and its annex are necessarily no more than informed guesses, since they depend on a series of variablefactors which cannot be accurately predicted and over some of which wehave little or no control.     But British policy will have its own bearing on these factors.    It is therefore important to consider the relationship of possible policies to our economic interests.British policy,       The three occasions in the past 20 years on which our oil supplies and general economic interests in the Middle East have been dangerouslythreatened by political developments have been the Arab/Israel wars of1948, 195 6 and 1967;-(i)  In 194G our economic stake was not so vital and our politicalposture, although not regarded as favourable by the Arabs, was lessunfavourable than that of any other great power.    Our economic interestsgreatly expanded during the succeeding period,(ii)  In 1956 we deliberately took the Israel side and incurred intenseodium in the Arab countries.    Our political position suffered permanentdamage.    Nevertheless, by a policy of lying low and disengaging from political involvement to the extent that was possible, we recoveredremarkably quickly,    Our economic interests in the area have expandedconsiderably during the past 11 years to our great advantage,(-&quot;-&quot;-)  I&quot;- 1967 for reasons varying from spontaneous public reaction to united Arab Republic (UAR) policies to downright misrepresentation andmalice we became identified to a wholly unreal degree with the Israelside and this has done much damage to our position in Arab countries.Memories of 1956 aggravated this.-1-)OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT)
4.       In, both 1956 and 1967 our national interests, political and economic,would have been endangered if Israel had been defeated and Nasser&apos;shegemony in the Arab world firmly established;  it would also have been difficult for us to maintain a purely neutral position if Israel was beingoverwhelmed,    But Israel has now demonstrated her ability, by her own efforts, to secure her existence, and her right of passage through theStraits of Tiran is again assured.    With United States diplomatic support for Israel on these points, there is no serious danger that either of these rights will be threatened for the foreseeable future, whether there is a peace settlement or not.    Nothing that v/e do can fundamentally improveIsrael&apos;s position;  nor is it likely to affect substantially the chances of a peace settlement.    Apart from Arab attitudes, the chances of a settle-merit turn on the acceptance or not by the Russians of the need to cometo an agreement with the Americans on terms which can be pressed onthe Arabs and Israelis.    We are unlikely to have more than a marginalinfluence on the outcome of such a dialogue if it takes pl3.ce, and, sincethe terms are likely to be unpalatable to both sides, we cannot gain by being associated with it.    (We may be compelled to take somediplomatic part e. g. in detailed negotiation in the United Nationsif some general United States/Soviet understanding is reached).5.       But if our actions and our attitudes to the Arab/Israel problemare unlikely to affect the chances of a settlement., they can very substan-tially affect our economic and other interests in the Middle East,     Thereare limits to the extent to which v/e can take a position based on acalculation of national interest alone;  these limits include both publicsentiment about the issue of principle involved in the right of a smallcountry to survive and special pressures in this country.    But, except to the extent to which v/e can take a position based on our interests which involves leaning if anything towards the Arab side, our interventions inthe Arab/Israel problem will work counter to the salvaging of our economic interests in the area.    If we follow the post-Suez policyof disengagement, there may be a better chance of restoring our situation than there was in 1957 because:(a) We have after all a far better case for our actions in the past six weeks than v/e had over Suez;  this should gradually come to berecognised,(b) Although it is too early to strike a balance with any certainty,the post-war position of Nasser in the Arab world is weaker insteadof stronger.     The same may prove to be true of the Russian position,though the Soviet Government will do everything within their power to redress this and they have active allies in the Arab world,6,       The Americans are differently placed (see paragraph 8 below),but there are signs that our need (as opposed to that of the Americans)to cultivate the moderate Arabs is now better understood in Washington,and recognised as being indirectly in the American as well as in theBritish interest.7,       The critical factor in the future of our economic interests is thus not so much whether the Arab/Israel problem will continue to disturb the area, but what role Britain will continue to play.    Themore retiring our role, the better our prospects seem likely to be,and vice versa.
American Policy80       The United States Government are differently situated for thefollowing reasonss-(a) They are not so vulnerable to economic pressures as we are,and the Arabs (and Russians) know it,(b) The domestic political pressure which the Israelis can bring to bear is stronger.(c) American influence over the Israeli Government and Americanability to provide aid as part of any settlement are things ofwhich the Arabs must take account, however hostile they feel.These factors taken as a whole give the Americans more scope than wehave for manoeuvring independently of Ajrab attitudes.    Arab hostility to the United States is at present greater than to us;  but the Arab need to ccme to terms with the United States is stronger.    Moreover, in thelast analysis it is Soviet fear of a military confrontation v/ith the UnitedStates which imposes limits on Soviet support for the Arabs of a kind which could bring matters to a ^rink1,Soviet Policy9.       In the long term, Russian policy in the Middle East is likely tocontinue to be directed towards:-(a) The maintenance or creation of pro-Soviet regimes in the area andthe encouragement of local Communist or &quot;National Liberation&quot;mo v e ment s ,(b) The erosion of Western influence, including the economic interestsof the United States and Britain,In the pursuit of these aims the Prussians will be subject to two importantlimitations(a) The wish to avoid a military conflict involving the United Statesreferred to above.    During the crisis their role was undoubtedlyone of caution and restraint as soon as they appreciated that this risk was a possibility.     They are unlikely to wish to see therecreation of a situation in which the Arabs might draw them into a conflict with the United States over Israel.(b) The fact that even if they can afford to sustain the UAR economyfor a period (and it is questionable whether they can take this on as a permanent commitment) they certainly cannot also afford the scale of economic support which will be necessary to tideother Arab countries over a prolonged period over which oilrevenues and other trading connections with the West areinterrupted.
10.      So far the Russians have shown few overt signs of looking beyondthe short-term tactical need to re-establish their credentials with theArabs.     The Israeli victory and the subsequent accusations that theyfailed to come to the assistance of the Arabs dealt a considerable blow to their prestige.    But the effect of this should not be exaggerated.     TheRussians probably consider that the damage to Western interests In thearea has been, and is likely to continue to be, very great.    This short-term Soviet aim of consolidating their position with the Arabs is likely toover-ride other consideraiions for some time, and during this period they/ill continue to exploit and stimulate Arab hostility to Britain and theUnited States.    Moreover, if it is correct that they wish to avoid anotherArab/Israel war, they will probably see less risk and more politicalbenefit to themselves in continuing to deflect Arab hostility primarilyagainst &quot;Western interests even after the present phase of consolidationis over,    Soviet policy, directly or indirectly, will encourage themaintenance of punitive measures on the oil trade and/or passage through the Suez Canal.     They v/ill also presumably continue their&apos;foothold in africa policy, exemplified by their arming of Somalia,and their interest, which must be assumed, in the future of the Yemenand Aden.11,        There are some factors which may 5n due course modify RussianMiddle East policy at least in part.    It is possible that if the dislocationcaused by the policy described were prolonged without any correspondingpolitical benefits, we could expect an Arab reaction against the Russians,The Russians may also become aware that they can only hope to deliverpolitical satisfaction to the Arabs in the shape of an Israeli withdrawalif they can come to some arrangement with the Americans,12,       Moreover, anticipating this reaction and as a result of thereappraisal of their policies in the area which they must also beundertaking, the Prussians may decide that their interests will bebetter served and the economic burden less by placing greater emphasis on Algeria, Syria, Iraq and/or other Arab countries rather than by continuing to back Nasser.Israel Policy13,       It is to be expected that the Israelis v/ill pursue a firm policy,i, e. no substantial concessions without a quid pro quo in the way ofpeace negotiations or acceptance of Israel&apos;s right to exist.    Sinceeconomic warfare against us is the most substantial weapon in Arabhands, this will tend to harcien Arab action against our economic interests on the pretext of British sympathy with and the belief in British influence over Israel.    There are nuances to this:  if the Israelis are provocativeon e. gs Jerusalem or the Yfest Bank, then the Arab will to maintainpunitive measures against us will be correspondingly strengthened;unless we succeed in dissociating ourselves convincingly from Israel&apos;section.    On some points we shall be able to do this, but there.will belimits and they may arise soon.Inter-Arab Policies14,      Much v/ill depend on the development of relations between theArab Governments,    For some time ahead, we must abandon any hopeof modifying the attitude of total hostility on the part of the &quot;revolutionary&quot;
Arab countries;  the UAR, Algeria, Iraq and Syria.    But domesticpressures may cause even them to modify their punitive economic measures; and these and other pressures - e.g. Asian and Africaneconomic interests - may cause the UAR to reopen the Suez Canal.In the main, however, we must assume that this group will do all theycan to hurt us, and will use all the means of pressure at their disposal to induce other Arab governments to do likewise.    In this they will haveSoviet and other Communist support.15.    Our hopes of easement therefore depend basically on the non-revolutionary governments and the extent to which they are able to act independently of the UAR Government.    It is in any case in thesecountries that the preponderant part of our economic interests - oilsupply, oil investment and trade - are situated: the two importantexceptions are the Suez Canal and Iraqi oil.16.   As time passes, we can expect disenchantment with Nasserand recriminations between the Arab Governments about responsibilityfor defeat to weaken Arab solidarity and the will to maintain a state ofaffairs which hurts the Arabs at least as much as it hurts the targetsof their hostility,     There is some evidence of this happening already:from the start the UAR, Algeria and Syria have taken a more extremeline on oil stoppages17.    A key element will be the position of President Nasser.    If hedisappeared, then there would almost certainly be a strong trend towards a less heroic and less cavalier attitude to the Arabs1 own economic interests.    At present, his disappearance does not seem likely to happen; but it is not impossible and, short cf it, the trend of his prestige and influence seems likely to be downward, unless hecan produce some new political success.18.    Nevertheless, it must be expected that the deep Arab sense ofhumiliation resulting in wholesale blaming of others and affectingnon-revolutionary as well as revolutionary governments alike, willcontinue to be a strong influence on governments&apos; actions for many months.     This will be so, even though emotions may cool and materialfactors begin to re-exert their influence,19.    The attitudes of Governments are only part of the problem.    Wemust also take account of popular pressures on moderately disposed,governments.     The propaganda of the UAR and the other revolutionaryArab governments will continue to incite anti-Western hostility amongmass opinion and industrial labour and to encourage subversive activity.This has been important in recent weeks when oil stoppages have often been either the direct result of action by organised labour or becausegovernments have found it necessary to appease popular feeling byacting themselves.    Although the more moderate Arab Governmentsseem to be regaining control of the general situation in their countries,they will have to pay great heed to these dangers for many months.They must therefore be expected to be cautious about any return to more normal relations with the West which could excite popular passions,stimulate strike action or facilitate subversion and sabotage.    Howeversuccessful these governments are in maintaining general control, wemust still allow for at least sporadic outbursts of popular actionagainst Western interests,-5-
20.    Finally, the attitudes of the Arab Governments will to a largeextent be affected by the course of events and the policies of othergovernments.     These are discussed above.     The two biggestunknowns are the future of Nasser, and the immediate direction of soviet policy in the area:  in particular the extent to which the Russianswill decide to continue to back Nasser or, as a result of their ownreappraisal, put more money on Algeria and other Arab horses.This memorandum assiunes that early progress towards a definitivesettlement of the Arab/Israel problem is unlikely, and that it willremain a disturbing political element for the foreseeable future,though without a renewal of hostilities.21.    The annex to this memorandum attempts to relate these Arabattitudes to our specific economic interests:  oil (which is looked atmore widely than the narrow question of supply to the United Kingdom),exports generally, arms sales, the Suez Canal and sterling.Conclusions22.    The conclusions are in fact set out in paragraphs 4 ana 5 above.We have an important and vulnerable industrial and financial stake inthe Arab countries.     We therefore have a strong interest in rebuildingour relations with these countries.    But the degree to which we canfollow a purely seL.-interested course of this kind is limited by public feeling on the merits of the Arab/Israeli dispute and by specialpressures existing on this subject in Britain.    We are therefore in a highly vulnerable position.23.    Given that the Israelis have shown an outstanding ability todefend themselves without our support, our best policy would appearto be that of the maximum practicable disengagement from this dispute.    We cannot wholly disengage, e. g. from discussion under united Nations auspices.    But in general, in our present militaryand economic situation, where we cannot intervene decisively, west and to lose more from activity which may be misunderstood (andexploited by Cairo Radio and the Soviet Government) than we gain fromthe wisdom and experience we may contribute to the problem.     this may not sound an heroic stance but it corresponds to the realitiesgoverning our economic interests in the area.G.

ANNEX To. C(67)123OilThis annex looks at oil matters more widely than just inthe context of supplies to the United Kingdom.     As regards our other economic interests it deals with our direct interests inthe Arab countries and only marginally with the wider implications-tions for our economy and the balance of payments, which would call for study by other departments concerned.2o    The United Arab Republic, Syria and Algeria can be expectedto continue to press the other Arab countries to make maximumuse of economic weapons, oil being the most powerful, against those countries which in their view oppose or do not sufficientlysupport the Arabs in their confrontation with Israel.       Kuwait,1 vSaudi Arabia, Libya (even though at present its oil exports have only been partially resumed) and the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms canbe expected, with varying degrees of determination and skill,lattempt to return fairly quickly to something approaching normalrelations with the West.      Saudi Arabia is the government most likely among the oil exporters to take an independent line,  and[the Gulf Sheikhdoms can be expected to follow her lead, at asafe distance.     Kuwait is less reliable owing to the regime&apos;spredeliction for nationalist gestures.      Of the other arab countries,  Iraq is the most likely to be influenced by the TT.A.E.dine in spite of the fact that it is in the worst position of all to forego its oil revenues for any length of time.       Even inllraq, however,  there is bound to be a reaction against theJpro-Nasser line as the economic effects begin to be felt;indeed exports have already been resumed on a selective basis.P&apos;    The likely effects on our oil interests are best considered/in the
I the short and the longer terms.      In the short term there isia good hope that Libyan exports will soon return to normalIcept to the United Kingdom and the United - States.      If shefcepted U.K. and U.S. destinations this would put her in the sameIsition as all the other oil producers.     Assuming that there isi change of government in Iraq., our best guess is that thelaqis are likely to be the least reliable and the most selectiveI regards oil exports and in any case they cannot ignore theUrians1 physical control over the pipelines from North Iraq toMediterranean.In the other oil countries the ban on exports to the U.K. andi3. may well not be removed for many weeks.     This is what thebe moderate governments have judged to be the least they couldfet away with as a gesture of solidarity and a safety valve forpular pressures.       Fortunately its practical effect is limitedpee we can replace supplies of Arab oil with non-Arab oil.twills however, have some balance of payments effects which Treasury and the Ministry of Power are keeping under review.)In the short term,  therefore, the supply situation as regardsab oil should not be too serious as long as there is a sufficientW?ee of international cc-operation to deal with it.      However,fen if the problem of Nigerian oil supplies is resolved satis-ptorily, there will continue to be a supply problem, primarilytanker availability,  arising from the closure of the transit&apos;ites.     This will almost certainly last for some months.     Onp of this the possibility of interruptions of exports by popularIlction must be allowed for.     For the next few weeks at least itS1iuld probably be pradent to assume that at any one time strikes,INonst rat ions or sabotage or a combination of these will reduce/current
Irrent availability of Arab oil supplies by, say, 1.5 millionfarrels a day (75 m. tons a year).k   A separate study is being made by the Departments concernedfour dependence on Arab oil supplies in the longer term.Turning from the supply problem to the future of our invest-Ints, our oil assets in the Arab countries are likely to beiffected adversely in the longer term, though it is impossible to1I precise about this.      The assets most in jeopardy are those of le Iraq. Petroleum Company (IPC) in which British Petroleum and[ell together hold nearly a half interest.     At the very least,ie chance of the IPCs settling its long-standing dispute withle Iraq Government in a fashion which would open the way to con-considerable   expansion of its activities is now very much&quot; slimmer and4 be lost for good.I   Our oil assets in the other Arab producing countries runess risk of expropriation or similar drastic action.     However,he fact that during the last few weeks the oil companies haveJpen subjected to direction and control by the concessionary govern-Ipts to an unprecedented degree and with impunity so far asIuective Intervention by the parent governments of the companiesI concerned,  may encourage the concessionary governments to bejpilarly assertive in future even in less abnormal circumstances,manifestation of this is likely to be increased pressure oncompanies from concessionary governments for a larger slice of le cake, to the detriment of our balance of payments:    i.e0 an^celeration of the process of erosion of the profitability ofjp production operations which we had already accepted asIgevitable.      There are also other foreign interests e.g. French,/Italianiehe
- k -Italian and Japanese, who might be ready to take advantages thrownopen by our difficulties.;British Exports to Arab CountriesST1I,    Annexed to this paper is a table showing British exports toIyirab countries (including arms) in 19&amp;5 and 1966, with a project-lion for 1967 of the likely figures of exports had the crisis,She fighting, and its consequential effects not intervened.     Thisshows that British exports to the Arab countries were likely in;1967 to be nearly  220 million.     The table divides the countriesInto two groups:    the first being the four &quot;revolutionary&quot;lountries,  the second group the others.      In the first group thefigure of  1+7*5 m. for exports to the &quot;revolutionary&quot; countries is likely to be greatly reduced by the reduction in purchasinglower from the stoppage of oil and the suspension of receipts from Canal dues.     This will apply even if the countries concerneddo not maintain a ban on British imports for the rest of the yearjr most of it.     On the other hand, there will to some extent bepressures to buy spare parts for goods already imported and consumers&apos;  and merchants&apos; pressures to continue to buy from tradi-lional suppliers.      If the ban continued to be strictly applied forIfee rest of the year, our exports to the &quot;revolutionary&quot; countriesRpr 1967 would probably only amount to  20 - 25 million of which1-5.6 million would have been exported prior to the end of April.I the ban were raised fairly quickly our exports for 1967 mightBill come to something as high as, say,  35 million.W&apos;  The remaining countries, i.e. the &quot;non-revolutionary&quot;^countries in group B, will not necessarily all behave in the sameMost of this group of governments will wish to avoidposing any restrictions but will have to take account of popular/opinion
I 41I - 5 -ipinion and pressure from the &quot;revolutionaries&quot;.     How successful;hey are in this will depend on events, other governments&apos;ittitud.es, and our policies.      In any case as a result of warlamage, lack of confidence during the crisis period, some losses in oil deliveries and other factors, our exports to thesecountries are likely to fall well below  171 m. this year.1ms SalesLI,   It is no easier as regards arms sales to work out with anyprecision either what would have happened had there been no war or what is likely to happen now there has been one.      There is little doubt that the Saudi Arabians and the Lebanese will wish,provided it is politically feasible for them, to continue withthe arrangements made (Saudi Arabia for the air defence schemeand the Lebanese for the Bloodhounds).      Of the rest the onlycountry with significant contracts outstanding is Iraq - 1,760,000 for miscellaneous ammunition and spare parts;    it is unlikely that they will wish to cancel these contracts although,;Since money will be short, they cannot be regarded as a good risk.12.  As regards the question of what contracts might yet be signedinuring the course of 1967 of any consequence, the effects of theMv on our interests may not be very severe, provided political^conditions are favourable for &quot;non-revolutionary&quot; Arab states tojtrade with us.     Apart from the possibility of selling JetProvosts for Iraq, which might be worth  1 or  2 million,  our luc-&apos;rative markets lie in the moderate or less radically orientatedpab states, namely Libya, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.     The airjWefence scheme for Libya is due to be presented shortly and it / ;:Seems on the whole unlikely that the Libyans will turn it down onl^litical grounds, unless the pressures on them are severe./The same
far-le same would probably apply as regards Lightnings for Kuwaitthe air work part of the air deal for Saudi Arabia.      (We havellso the possibility of selling naval equipment to Libya andlaudi Arabia.).3,  At a very rough guess, which must be treated with greatIserve, we might quantify the losses to us of arms sales as aIsult of the war as of the order of something under  1 millionijen if Syria, Sudan and the U.A.R. cancel existing orders.     Theesses as a result of a further deterioration in our relationsiith the &quot;moderate&quot; Arab countries are unquantifiable, but could very c considerable..&apos;iez Canalm,  The closure,  and prospects of continued closure of the Suezanal, have important implications for our commercial interestsver and above its effect on oil supplies and oil prices.     So longis the Suez Canal is closed to all shipping a competitive advantageffn the markets of East Africa,  South Asia, the Par East andlustralasia is given to our main competitors in the region, i.e.i;pe Japanese, Australians and the South Africans.      If the Canaljpere opened but still closed to U.K. and U.S. ships,  the competitive position of onr own exports would not be so seriously affected,Assuming that they could find shipping space on other f lag c arriers,lit there would obviously be a prospect of loss to BritishSipping earnings unless all the British ships concerned could bepofitably employed on journeys to other destinations.     A closureft the Canal to British and American goods,  irrespective of thep-ag of the ship in which they were carried, would, of course,j&amp;ace British goods at a substantial commercial disadvantage/against
Igginst virtually all competitors in virtually all Asian,nstralasian and East African markets,Iterling BalancesI5,   Continued denial of oil to the U.K. by Arab states, any more;eneral difficulties experienced by our oil companies in thosetates, a prolonged closure of the Suez Canal, and an effectiveEmbargo of U.K. exports to Arab countries would be bound to affectConfidence in the pound because of the extra strain which theyould throw on our balance of payments.     We must also bear in mind the possibility that the Arab states might decide to link withShe oil boycott a massive withdrawal or switch of holdings of sterling,     The Arab Governments which hold large reserves interling would probably be reluctant to lend themselves tolanoeuvres of this kind, which would involve them in considerable financial loss, but they might not be able to hold out againstpressure from others.     A large Arab withdrawal from sterling mightIf course produce a chain reaction which could put us in aifficult position.     The Treasury would no doubt wish to expressviews on this question.
