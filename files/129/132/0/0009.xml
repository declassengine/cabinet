C(67) 129 COPY HO.10th July, 1967CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE;  education memorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and ScienceIn the Chancellor!s paper C(67) 125, paragraph 10, I am invitedto suggest cuts in education amounting to  45 million in 1970-71,2,       I am not clear as to the grounds for this invitation.    It is basedon the assumption of a total cut in spending of  500 million, - But mycolleagues will recall the I proposed an alternative figure to this of 300- 350 million;  this v/ould allow personal consumption to growat 2 per cent a year, the same as the average for the period of 196.1-66.At our &quot;Second Reading&quot; debate on 27th June, &quot;the balance of opinioninclined towards a reduction smaller than the  500 million proposedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot; (CC(67) 42nd Conclusions),     Thisbalance was not disturbed at the further meeting on 6th July.3.       Quite apart from this, the Chancellor&apos;s suggested figures of 45 million is unacceptable on a number of grounds.(i)  He says that an increase in the price of school meals cannot beregarded as available to meet the cost of the education programme.But the school meals and milk service is an integral part of the education service.    It has been considered as part of educational expenditure inevery PESC exercise.    And it is so regarded in the present Civil Review -see C(67) 102, Section III, paragraph 7,     The decision last November toraise the price of school meals was taken in the context of the educationalbudget as well as a proposed scheme of family endowment (CC(66) 58thConclusions, Minute 4),    I cannot accept that the rules should be alteredat this stage,(ii)   The cuts proposed by the Chancellor do not compare like withlike.     In the case of roads and housing, they are cuts in a total which includes &quot;further proposals&quot; over and above the basic programmes sofar agreed by the Cabinet (see C(67) 125, paragraphs 4 and 7).    I estimate that these further proposals have the effect of increasing the basic programme for roads and housing by about  40 million in each case.By contrast, the basic programme for health is unchanged, that for education down by  20 million (because of revised forecasts of thenumber of teachers), and that for social security also down.    In other words, education and social security have already made some contribu-tions (if fortuitously) to the required savings:  roads and housing start with an overdraft.    To put it differently, the chancellor s suggestion for education largely ignores the &quot;further proposals&quot; which have been and must be made in education of the same kind as those already takenCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
into account for roads and housing.     They include Plowden educationalpriority areas (ray paper C(67) 9) and the Open University (my paperIVlISC 124(66) 1).    They also include (C(67) 102, Section III, paragraph 6)some further expenditure on Plowden, new medical schools (the ToddCommission v/ill report early next year), something to enable morestudents to get into the universities and smaller sums for researchcomputers, educational technology and retraining of teachers.    these further proposals, to some at least of which we have public commitments,should be included, as with roads and housing, in the basic total fromwhich any cuts are made.(iii) The Chancellor refers to student loans.    But Annex Bo ofC(67) 100, which was agreed betv/een my Department and the Treasury,records that substantial savings could not appear in 1970-71,    Thusstudent loans are irrelevant to the Chancellor&apos;s problem, which isbasically that he faces a 6. 9 per cent increase in public expenditurein 1968-69;  thereafter the prospective increase (even before cuts) isonly 2. 6 per cent per annum, which is lower than the expected increasein GNP (and of course the Chancellor also proposes to keep a contingencyallowance of  250 million - see C(67) 103, paragraphs 10 and 13).(iv) I would regard it (quite apart from the merits) as politically outof the question to go back on raising the school leaving age in 1970&quot;71and break a pledge frist made by the Conservatives which we have repeatedly endorsed (as has Mr. Heath only a fortnight ago).Moreover the Party would hardly think the leaving age less urgentthan colour TV or local radio or BBC pop or P1157 or Concord or theChannel Tunnel, all of which we seem to be able to afford.4.       I am of course ready to play my part and find a reduction in thePESC item &quot;Education (with school meals and milk)&quot; as part of whatevertotal cut the Cabinet decides on.     But  45 million, -without even taking into account my further proposals, is totally unreasonable.    &quot;7e must bear in mind the words of the First Secretary (DEA Progress Reportfor July) &quot;Education is an essential support for economic growth,    Itplays a vital part in meeting the needs of the economy for skilledmanpower of all kinds, contributes to the advance of industrialtechnology, and improves the general efficiency and competence of the whole population&quot;.C.
