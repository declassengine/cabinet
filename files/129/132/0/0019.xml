C(67) 13924th July, 1967CABINETCOPY NO.PUBLIC SECTOR prices memorandum by the Minister of power the First Secretary of State in C(67) 137 proposes that thereshould be some temporary reduction in the gas industry^ financial objectives so that it can minimise its price increases.2.       Price increases in the nationalised industries are bound to bemore or less embarrassing in the context of prices and incomes policy.On the other hand financial weakness in these industries hasimplications which may be equally embarrassing if not arrested in time.The treatment of gas and electricity prices illustrates this dilemma.Electricity price increases3.       In March I proposed that electricity prices should be raised byabout 7 per cent in line with a gross return of 11, 5 per cent on net assets,as compared v/ith the 12.4 per cent required by the industry&apos;s present financial objectives.    This would have brought in a balance of revenue,after interest and depreciation of 5.4:0 million in reduction of Exchequerborrowing.    It was however instead decided, in view of other demands on the Exchequer, that the industry should be asked to raise prices byabout 11 per cent in order to achieve the full 12. 4 per cent return on capital and so bring in a balance of revenue of about  80 million(Pl(67) 10th Meeting).    I made it clear at the time that increases ofthis size were bound to have implications for gas prices.    I subsequentlyannounced the decision on 12th May.Gas Industry price increases4.       JLast month the gas industry asked my advice on the level offinancial performance they should aim at in the next financial year.Without price increases the industry^ total balance of revenue afterinterest and depreciation was expected to be at most  1 million in thecurrent year, to be followed in 1968-69 by a deficit of not less than 7 million.    In view of the expected heavy costs to the industry duringthe transition to natural gas, and as the logical corollary of the decisionthey had taken on electricity prices I recommended in Pl(67) 49 that theindustry should be required to aim in 1968-69 at a net return corresponding to the electricity industry&apos;s gross return before depreciation of12,4 per cent.    This objective could be expected to lead the Boards to-1-IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
propose price increases averaging up to l\ per cent to bring in 32 million.    Maintenance of the existing objective would require anincrease of 5-f- per cent to bring in  23 million but I favour the higherincrease both because of the need to equalise competition with electricity(we were committed to progressively aligning the financial objectives of the industries in the White Paper on Fuel Policy (Cmnd. 2798),paragraph 91), and because the odium will be no greater for themarginally higher one than for the lower.5.       The dangers of not strengthening the gas industryTs financialposition at this moment are serious, and I could not agree that their financial objective should now be lowered to the point of simply breakingeven on the assumption that the immense returns forecast from sales of natural gas will all materialise as planned.    In the next couple of years the industry will be faced with a heavy marketing operation to expandsales and to achieve the absorption of natural gas at the high rates whichwe have in mind0    The Boards will have so to arrange the structure oftheir tariffs as to offer extremely keen prices to industrial consumerstaking natural gas.    This will inevitably lead to pressure for concessions on existing contracts while existing gas-making plant isstill in use.    This pressure will be difficult to resist, and the Boardsmay be compelled to lose revenue as a result.    That would be the worst of all moments (it would be wrong to take account of the possible proximityof a General Election) to have to raise prices.    Prices would be much better raised now,    I therefore adhere to my proposal that the gas industry should be required to aim at a net return of 6. 8 per cent in 1968-69, withthe effect that prices would need to be increased by a.n average of up to?! per cent.6.       Of course it can always be said on these occasions that theindustry might improve its productivity.    There is alv/ays room for improvement in productivity.    The gas industry is alive to the need for it, and their efforts in this direction, including their employment of management consultants where necessary, will continue.    In the past five years the industry^ productivity has increased by 5 per cent a year.Between 1962-63 and 1968-69 its costs have fallen from 22. 3 pence to21.4 pence a therm, but it would be unrealistic to hope for furtherdramatic reductions in the next year or two.    If the industryhs positionis not to be seriously weakened, a price increase now is in my opinionimperative.7. Lastly, if by not raising gas prices we weaken the competitive position of electricity, the enormous investment already made in that industry may well be unremunerative.conclusion.       In view of our earlier decision on electricity prices, I do not think we can reasonably avoid taking a parallel decision on gas,    I accordingly recommend that the industry should be required to meet a financial objective of 6. 8 per cent net of depreciation next year, which will entailincreasing gas prices by an average of up to l\ per cent this autumn.R. M.Ministry of Power, S.W.1.21st July, 1967-2-
