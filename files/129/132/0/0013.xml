DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY !S GOVERNMENT)65C(67) 133 COPY NO.___20th July, 1967CABINET^NDUS^^LEjCI^NSION:-bill memorandum by l\&amp; First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Economic AffairsThe Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy has been considering proposals by the Minister of Technology for the early introduction of an Industrial Expansion Bill.    Briefly, this would bean enabling Bill giving general powers to introduce, and finance,measures designed to promote industrial efficiency, extend orsustain productive capacity and support technological advance.Examples of the kind of scheme which might be promoted under theBill are the acquisition of the Beagle Aircraft Company (which hasalready been agreed but not implemented), and measures to sustaininvestment in the Machine Tool Industry during periods of recession.2.       Schemes falling within the general purposes of the Bill wouldbe submitted to Parliament in the form of Orders subject to affirmative Resolution.     The Bill would provide that government financial assistance for approved schemes might be in the form of grant, loan, guarantee or, in agreement with the other parties concerned, by equity participation and would require the method and amount of financial assistance to be set out in the Order for eachscheme submitted to Parliament.    The Bill would not confer anycompulsory powers.    It is contemplated that the Government would,when the Bill was introduced, submit to Parliament proposals for a select Committee which could examine schemes promoted under theBill.3.      The object of the Bill would be to provide a faster and more flexible Parliamentary procedure for Government assistance to industry: not only in order to avoid taking up excessive parliamentary time with individual Bills for individual projects but also to ensurethat, for example, swift counter-cyclical action could be taken whenit was needed and was not prevented by lack of Parliamentary time atthe critical period.     At the same time, the proposed SelectCommittee would enable Parliament to scrutinise all government measures taken under the powers conferred by the Bill and should provide an effective answer to criticism that this enabling Bill woulderode Parliaments powers of supervision and control.-1-
4c     A large majority of the Committee on Economic Policy favoursthese proposals - and no member is actively opposed to them - on theunderstanding that the enabling powers would be available to ministers of all Departments with sponsorship responsibilities forindustries and not to the Minister of Technology alone.     The Committeerecognise, however, that such a Bill will be controversial both withinParliament and in Industry, and that careful advance preparation byway of discussions with Industry is clearly essential.    The Committeealso consider that an explanatory White Paper, of which a draft isalready being prepared, should be presented to Parliament very shortly before the Bill is introduced? a long interval betweenpublication of the White Paper and introduction of the Bill would belikely to give rise to unnecessary anxieties about, and thereforehostility towards8 the Bill.5.      Timing, however, presents a problem.    Full discussion and consultation with Industry will inevitably take some time and the drafting of a general enabling Bill of this character, which provides the necessary powers without going so wide as to give rise tounnecessary anxieties, will not be straightforward^    On the otherhand, one of the schemes which the Minister of Technology wishes to implement under the Bill, when enacted, is the acquisition of theBeagle Aircraft Company.    The terms of the Governments agree-ment with the vendor require that legislation to enable theGovernment to acquire this Company should be laid before parliament by the end of this year and should be enacted within 9 months of firstreading.     There are also two other aircraft schemes requiringlegislation - financing Concord production and acquisition of aGovernment interest in the merged Airframe Industry - which couldbe effected under the Bill and, although these are not so urgent asBeagle, powers will almost certainly be needed by mid-1968.6. In these circumstances, the Ministerial Committee on economic policy have concluded that:-(a) The Minister of Technology should now be authorised toarrange for the drafting of an Industrial Expansion Billon the lines described above, which would give enablingpowers to Ministers of those Departments havingsponsorship responsibilities for industries.(b) I should arrange forthwith for consultations with both sides of industry and with the National Economic development council abo\it the proposed Bill.(c) An explanatory White Paper should be issued very shortly before the introduction of the Bill.(d) The Committee should examine the position further towardsthe end of September, in the light of progress of the consultations with industry and of the drafting of the Bill,to determine whether(i)      the Industrial Expansion Bill should be introduced atthe beginning of next session;  or-2-
(ii)      the introduction of the Industrial Expansion Billshould be deferred, and consequently a separate Billto acquire the Beagle Aircraft Company should beintroduced at the beginning of the session,70      I ask my colleagues to endorse these conclusions,    I will put before them in due course the recommendations of the economic policy Committee on the timing of the introduction of the industrial expansion Bill,M.S.Department of Economic Affairs, S.
