FAMILY endowment memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerWhen the Cabinet last considered this (CC(67) 36th Conclusions,Minute 4) they were then on balance in favour of an accross the boardincrease in family allowances with, suitable adjustments in taxation.But the amount of any increase and the way in which the money was raised were left open,2.       Since then I have devoted much time and effort to a thoroughreview of all the facts and the ways of dealing most effectively andat tolerable cost with the problem before us.    In so doing I have hadno wish to question any final decisions the Cabinet may come to.     Themore however I have looked into all this and the more I have probed thepros and cons, -the more firmly convinced have I become of what thesolution should be.    So firm are my convictions that I feel bound toput these to my colleagues.3.       I am in no doubt that the most effective, most politicallyacceptable, and the most economical answer is a housing allowance(HA) scheme of which details are in Annex B,     Let the facts speakfor themselves,4.       Briefly the scheme would help low income families with their housing costs.    Families with one child or more with incomes at orbelow the qualifying level would get actual &quot;rent&quot; (i, e. rent and rates or in the case of the owner-occupier, equivalent outgoings) or 30s, aweek whichover was higher.    If income was above the qua3ifying levelthe amount paid would be tapered off.    For example, a three-childfamily with income up to about  12 per week would get 30s. or actualrent in full if higher.    Such a family earning  12 per week would have their income brought up to a minimum of  13 10s,    Family allowances(and up to  2 war pensions) will be paid in addition.5,       This scheme would cost  30- 35 million a year.    It would achieve the following:-(i)  It would bring up to present supplementary benefit (S3) levelsor above about 86 per cent (it is assumed here and elsewhere-that theresults of the Report on Circumstances of Families published on 5th July are still broadly true.     In any case there are no other figures to go on) i. e, 138, 000 of the 160, 000 families with incomes below these levels (such families are known as &quot;deficient&quot; families).WENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC 1/lAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)G4C(67) 128 COPY NO.____10th July, 1967CABINET
(ii) It would give help to a further 300,000 families with incomes at or above these levels,(iii) SBs are being improved in November,    This may v/ell mean that more than 160, 000 families will then have incomes below S3 levels (thehigher the level of SBs the more &quot;deficient&quot; families there are likely tobe).    Even then the HA scheme should bring more than 70-80 per cent of &quot;deficient&quot; families up to the improved SB levels,(iv) It would help greatly with &quot;wage stop&quot; cases i. e, people who arenot allowed tc draw SBs in full because they normally earn less than this.The number of people who suffer in this way would drop from about26, 000 at the moment to about 12, 000,(v)   Of the 22, 000 families who would not be brought up to presentsupplementary levels, no two-child families would be left with an income below these levels by more than 10s. per adult or 5s. perchild,6,       Compare this with a scheme for increasing family allowances(FAM) by 5s. or 7s, per v/eek,     This would bring up to present SBlevels only 35 per cent and 44 per cent respectively (instead of 86 percent) of families  who now have incomes below these levels and a much lower percentage - perhaps only 25 per cent and 35 per cent - of thoselikely to be below the improved November SB    levels up to those levels.The number of &quot;wage stop&quot; cases would be only marginally cut insteadof more than halved,     16-20 per cent i. e. about 30-35,000 families(instead of none as under the HA scheme) would be left with incomesbelow present SB levels by 10s. or more-per adult and of thece20 per cent would be below by up to 30s. per adult.7.     Look too at the comparative costs.    The HA scheme costs 30-35 million a year.    A 5s. or 7s. increase in FAM costs about 62 million per annum or  87 million per annum net of tax and otheradjustments - two to three times the cost of the HA scheme and lessthan half the efficiency in helping those with low incomes.     TheMinister of Social Security has just published the Report on FamilyCircumstances.     This shows the plight of &quot;deficient&quot; families i, e. thosebelow SB levels who cannot draw these benefits or cannot draw themin full.    We shall be judged by our success in helping these families and not by how far we give marginal help to large numbers of families with higher incomes,8,     A table showing the comparative effects of Ithe HA scheme and5s, and 7s, increases in FAM is at Atmex A.9.     Some comparative examples are:-(1)   Under the HA scheme a 3-child family with an income of 13 per week would get a minimum of 29s. extra perweek.    By contrast a 7s. increase in FAM would give14s, per v/eek whatever the rent.
(2)     Under the HA scheme a 2-child family earning  12 perweek and paying 50so rent would get 44s. extra perweek.     By contrast a 7s. increase in FAM would give only 7 s. extra per week.(3)     Under the HA scheme a 5 -child family earning  16 perweek and paying 50s. rent would get 5 0s. extra per week.A 7s. FAM increase would give 28s extra per week,10.     These examples speak for themselves though my colleagues willnotice in particular that:-(a) 1-child families are eligible for help under the HA schemebut get nothing from increases in FAMj(b) the HA scheme helps poor families with a major element -rent and rates - in their living costs and deals with thefact that it is a variable element. A little help spreadevenly regardless is bound to give more to some whoseneeds are less and not enough to those whose needs aregreater!(c) under my scheme the poorest get most.    The alternative schemes do better than mine fcr the better off,11.     I know that some of my colleagues continue to see objection toan income test.    I respect their views0    But let us not be misled intothinking that it resembles the Means Test of the 1930s in any way.There is growing public opinion that help should be concentrated whereit is most wanted.    There is little or no evidence that people object tothis and plenty that they do not.    Witness the success of the Minister of social Security^ new Supplementary Benefit Scheme.    There is reallyno evidence that a scheme such as I favour has any effect on incentivesor on a man&apos;s self-respect - I believe that these are outdated and out-worn beliefs.    It is certainly not the case in Council Rent RebateSchemes.    A family that is no longer crippled by paying rent is more likely to have new hope and resolution.     There will always be a few who do not and will not strive for a better standard of living than any Statesupport can give.     But for those who cannot better themselves becausethey are handicapped or infirm surely it is right that their individualneeds should be carefully and sympathetically considered.12.     In my view the case for a housing allowance scheme comparedwith any other approach is overhwelming.    The case on public expendi-ture grounds is also conclusive.    Indeed the latest estimate is that thepercentage increase of Supply expenditure 1968-69 over 1967-68 lookslike being by far the highest annual increase both at constant and current prices ever known.13.     Nevertheless if in spite of all the disadvantages and the increasing unpopularity of a straight family allowance system mycolleagues feel we must go for an increase in FAM across the boardthen I should not contemplate an increase of more than 5s. or 7s. foreach second and subsequent child.     This would mean bringing FAM in total up to 13-15s. for second children and 15-l7s for all subsequent children.     A 7s. increase would far more than restore the purchasing
3 EB C RET74power of FAM as originally introduced.    An increase of only 3s,, 7d.would restore family allowances to their value in 195 6 when they werelast increased.    A 7s. increase would roughly match the rise in average earnings since 1946.    We have also to set what we do against the recent increase of 10s. in old age pensions.    On public expenditure grounds anoutgo of  62 million net for a 5s0 increase in family allowances would bedifficult enough let alone of  87 million net for a 7s. increase.14.     I would propose to raise whatever money is required by somecombination of a reduction in child allowances, a reduction in the reduced rate band of income tax coupled perhaps with an increase in personal allowances and possibly some addition to corporation tax orother adjustments.    I cannot accept a straight exchange between family allowances and child tax allowances.15.     I cannot so early in the financial year be sure what the precisecombination should be but it would enable the cost to a greater orless extent to fall on the whole body of standard rate taxpayers and notonly those with children,     We must of course be concerned not only withthe relative position of families with lower incomes and families withrather higher incomes i, e. vertical relationships, but also with therelative position of those with children and those without children atall levels of income, i. e. horizontal relationships.16.     I must also report that any scheme which attempted to relatefamily allowances and child tax allowances would present serious difficulties.    The conditions of entitlement to the 2 allowances differwidely.    Also FAM is a weekly payment; tax allowances are given on ayearly basis.    Reduced child tax allowances cannot be fitted exactly toa FAM increase.    Some people receiving National Insurance or industrial injuries benefits including widows would find themselvesgetting the same cash payments for children but having their tax allowances cut.    Quite a lot of people e. g. those with student children would find their tax allowances cut and get no increase in FAM.    To try and deal with these inequities would cost a lot of extra money and be very complicated.17.     There remains the question of an interim increase in family allowances for which power is being taken in the National insurance bill.    There is wide expectation of some increase.    If the cabinet decide that some increase there must be, I am sure we can go no further than to give 5s. for 4th and subsequent children.     This would cost about  13 million in a full year and seems as much as we ought to do as   apermanent increase.Conclusion18.     I therefore strongly recommend my colleagues to approve:-(a) a housing allowance scheme as proposed above at a cost of  30-35 million per annum together with(b) a 5s. increase in family allowances for 4th and subsequent children at a cost of  13 million gross perannum with effect from end October neist.-4-
19c      There would have to be talks with, local authorities about tyingin their rent and rate rebate schemes with the HA Scheme.    But I see no reason why a satisfactory settlement could not be reached.    this problem arises also in the case of Supplementary Benefits and the Ministerof Social Security has just written to the Minister of Plousing stressingthe need to deal with it.    SBs and the HA Scheme could be covered atthe same time.20.      If there are details of the HA Scheme which my colleagues wantlooked at further the Ministerial Committee on Social Services might beasked to do this as a matter of urgency.J. C,Treasury Chambers, S.

Table therefore shows most favourable effect of an increase in family allowances.Average &quot;rent&quot; for a family is about 40s.   Most &quot;rents&quot; fall between 30s. and 50s.Under my proposals an interim FAM increase would be payable in addition to anyhousing allowance; but the Minister&apos;s proposal would subsume any interim increase in the main one later.k*oss income includes family allowances at current level of 8s. for 2nd child,10s. for 3rd and subsequent, which would continue to be paid over and aboveof the benefits above.
ANNEX BHOUSING- ALLOWANCE scheme.     Ths essential purpose of the scheme would he to help low incomefamilies with their housing costs, one of the main factors incausing hardship,2.     Families with one child or more &quot;below the age limits for family allowances and whose incomes were at or below the qualifyingincome level (see below) would obtain benefit equal to the actual&quot;rent&quot; (i.e. rent and rates or, in the case of the owner-occupied,equivalent outgoings) if this were reasonable, or 30s a week,whichever was the higher.   If income exceeded the qualifying level,the amount paid would be reduced on a tapering basis.3.     The main features of the scheme would be -(a)   Qualifying income leyjgl.      9 a week for a married couple, or  6   15s for a single person, with one child, increasedby  1 a week for each child after the first and by the amountof national insurance contributions (l5s 8d   a week for anemployed married man from November this year).   -family allowances and war pensions up to  2 per week would be disregarded, other income would be taken into account.03)   Tapper.     Benefit would be reduced by 6d for each Is. income in excess of the qualifying level for the first  2? 9d. Inthe Is   for the second  2   and shilling for shillingthereafter.(0)   Application for an allowance would be made in writing normallyby the husband, to a central headquarters.   It would consist of -(i)   a printed form filled in by the employer certifying theintention would be to make this form as simple aspossible, drawing on the experience of, e.g. localauthority rent or rate rebate forms).The initiative in making a claim would have to rest with the family concerned, but a publicity campaign.could be mounted toencourage applications from those believing themselves to be eligible,(ii)husband&apos;s earnings in the previous six-month period;a form completed by the husband containing other relevantdetails, e.g, other income, dependants, rent, etc. (The(I)
benefit would be assessed for six months at a time by reference to the above factors.   Use of earnings in theprevious six months would permit the averaging out offluctuations or other unusual features and would avoid creating any immediate disincentive;, e.g. to work overtime.Payment.    The payment orders would be cashable by eitherhusband or wife on a weekly basis at the Post Office.Re-application.   It would be necessary for the husband to re-apply at the end of the period if he wished to goon receiving the allowance for the next six months.Instructions for re-applying could be included in thepayment order book.   It would be necessary to provide an up-to-date certificate of earnings from the employer andto refer to any other changes in circumstances since theprevious application.Verification.     As indicated, a fresh certificate of earnings would be required from the employer every sixmonths.   Rent would be checked initially (from the rentbook itself or from a landlord&apos;s certificate), but notthereafter unless a change was notified by the claimant(this on the assumption that any changes are likely tobe upwards).     There would be a sample check (perhaps10 per cent) of other details, including number ofchildren (by reference to PAM records), other income, etc.;,  &apos; -Cost.     The cost, assuming a 90 per cent uptake, is estimatedat about  32 million.     For the future, cost would risewith any general rise in rent levels and fall with anygeneral rise in the level of low earnings.   After the initial period of implementation it would require a staffof about 700 to run the scheme.   Centralisation of thework would avoid further strain on local Ministry of social Security offices.
