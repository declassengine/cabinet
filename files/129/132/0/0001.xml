HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT)Qiklllil COPY NO. -6il4th July; 1967CABINETDEFENCE AND THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTSNote by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister I circulate, as backgroundinformation for the Cabinet in relation to C(67) 117, the attached memorandum by the Secretary of State for Defence which has beenconsidered by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee.(Signed)   BURKE trend cabinet Office, S.W. 1.4th July, 1967
DBraCZi AM) THE BALANCE OF PAYM&amp;KTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for defence in discussion of public expenditure, defence - andparticularly the stationing of forces overseas - has often&quot;been singled out for attack as an activity which not onlyuses a large amount of national resources, &quot;but alsoimposes a heavy &quot;burden - approaching  300M a year - on thebalance of payments.     I have felt for some time that thiswas a distorted picture and I attach a note which explainswhy the burden in the present financial year will be no more than about  100M - an amount which will be almostbalanced by receipts of foreign exchange from the sales ofarms.2.     This conclusion results from making allowance for allthe offsets which we have been able to achieve.     It shows the importance of securing satisfactory offset arrange-raents for foreign exchange expenditure in Germany and onthe purchase of equipment.     It also shows the value offoreign exchange earnings from the export of arms.3.     It does not provide an argument against reducingdefence expenditure to the minimum level consistent withthe tasks which the Services are required to perform.But, in my view, it strongly suggests that there is no great difference between defence and other forms of public expenditure in the burden they place on the balance ofpayments.h*     The note also shows the dangers of thinking in termsof the gross expenditure of foreign exchange on stationingcosts.     It points out, for example, that the figure wehave used for the foreign exchange cost of stationing forcesin Malta overstates by more &quot;than two and a half times theburden on the balance of payments.5.     I recognise that these conclusions must be used with discretion, especially since we must do nothing to make more difficult the offset agreements which contribute tothe result.     But I would ask my colleagues to take note of them as an important contribution to our current dis-cussions of defence policy, and of government expenditurein relation to the balance of payments.D..H,Ministry of Defence,28th June, 1967.
ANN5X 6PEP! NCE. ..ND. TH3 L/J?C3 0? PAYIvf NTSIt is generally believed that the defence programmeimposes a heavy hurden on the &quot;balance of payments. Thefigures which have normally &quot;been used to illustrate thisshow the following   picture for 1967/68;JLMForeign exchequer.t-.nge cost ofstationing forces overseas 256Cost of &quot;buying equipment from abroad       7k330Offset by net receipts from head-quarters transactions (e.g. 61Government sales of equipment,               --R &amp; D levies)Net foreign exchange cost 269The conclusion drawn from these figures is that defence iscosting the balance of payments S269M.2.     These figures are misleading because they do not allow for a number of offsets;   the net burden of defence on the balance of payments is very much smaller.     Theobject of this note is to assess, so far as this can bedone, what the figures should be.Stationing&quot; Costs3.     Stationing costs have hitherto consisted of*a. our forces&apos; net drawings in overseascurrency through paymasters;b. the overseas currency cost of oil forthe forces jc     remittances to pensioners e.g. in Nepal;dc      the cost of the joint agreement with the australians on ranges and facilities.This definition was adopted because it was useful to theTreasury in preparing the total balance of paymentsfigures.     But it does not provide the most relevant basis for decisions on deployment.k.     The main cost basis for decision on deployments, ason everything else, must be the effect on the defence budget.     If, in addition to this, foreign exchange costhas to be considered, the relevant figure is not the grossexpenditure of foreign exchange, but &quot;the extra foreign exchange costs of deploying forces abroad as compared withhaving the same forces at home.     It is true that theforces at home are net consumers of foreign exchange, likeevery other inhabitant of this country who does not directly contribute to exports.     But this element in theforeign exchange cost of the forces can best be regardedas subsumed in the budgetary cost criterion;   we did not,/for example,
?-2-for example, assess the foreign exchange costs of collectingand distributing SET.5,     To measure the extra foreign exchange cost of station-ing forces overseas instead of at home we have to make fouradjustments to the 32561:1 in paragraph 1 above.     First,some minor changes are needed in the division &quot;betweenstationing costs and headquarters payments so that the stationing costs total allows, for example, for receipts from the Hong Kong Government and the proceeds of disposalsin Germany, hut does not include Ministry of Technologypayments to Australia for the provision of ranges and facilities or the notional foreign exchange costs of oil(see paragraph 12),     As a result the  256M becomes  233M.Next two calculated reductions are required:a. we must deduct an allowance for the lower U.K.import bill because 320,000 Service personnel and their dependants are overseas - we callthis the &quot;home saving&quot; element;b. we must also allow for the higher U.X, exportsdue to the expenditure of &quot;die forces abroad.Appendices I and II show how these allowances have been calculated. The following table shovs their effect onthe conventional stationing cost figures:1967/68costs asincorporatedin Annex H of cmnd 3203 butamended as in       &quot;Homepara k and with   Saving&quot;   Exports NetArea	Germany added	      Element	Generated	FigureGermany	80	12.0	1.2	66.8Gibraltar	6	0.8	3.1	2.1Malta	10.5	1.6	U.8	U.1Cyprus	15.5	2.I4.	3.2	9.9Libya	2	0.3	0.5	1 .2Aden	11	1.9	2.3	6*8Persian Gulf	12	2.2	2.0	7.8Malaysia	17.5	3.0	1 .k	13.1Singapore	56.5	9.1	10.2	37.2Nepal	2.5	0.1	-	2MHong Kong	6.5	1 ,8	2.0	2.7Rest of W0 Europe	U.5	0.6	-	3.other	8.5	0.8	-	7o7	233.0	3606	30.7	165o7/ this information reflects the position as seenlast January;   revised forecasts are at present being made-,
6.       The table shows that the effect of these adjustmentsis not only to reduce the total stationing costs to S16.6M,hut also to alter the relative burden from stationing forcesin different overseas areas.     It shows, for example, thatthe figure we have been using for the foreign exchange costof stationing forces in Malta overstates by more than two and a half times the burden on the baljince of payments.7.       The fourth adjustment required is to allow for certainoffsets to stationing costs.     These are:a. receipts under the German offset and relatedarrangements which are expected to yield 569Min 1967/68 (say  56M net after allowing forimport content);b. receipts of  611 from disposals abroad by theMinistry of Defence in countries other than Germany (this is really an adjustment of the type mentioned in paragraph h, but as itcannot easily be allocated, to the particular areas concerned it is included here).3.       The result, after all these adjustments are made, isthat the total net foreign exchange cost of stationing forcesabroad instead of at home will be about  100M in 1967/68,instead of &quot;the conventional figure hitherto used forstationing costs --  256?.!.     There may be other relativelyminor additions and subtractions which could be made, butthe adjustments described above have been calculated on a conservative basis:    allowance for any other factors is unlikely to affect the conclusion that a figure of  100M,and not S256M, is of the right order of magnitude.Equipment Costs9.       The foreign exchange cost of equipment bought fromabroad is estimated at  &quot;7UM in 1967/68,     Against this canbe set:-a..     receipts from those U03. forces stationed inthis country which provide the offset to theHercules/Phantom/Polaris agreements -  hOM,including receipts on Government account;D,     private arms sales under the F.111 offset agreement - about  5M;c. the value of new defence equipment sold on government account -  35M.10,     The net effect is that the expenditure of  7UM on equipment is offset by receipts of about  80M, a surplus ofabout,  51.11,     Under N.&apos;:.T0 definitions, however, receipts from sales of defence equipment by industry are included as an offsetin calculating the foreign exchange burden of defence.These are expected to amount to some  100M in 1967/68, ofwhich only  5M is included in paragraph 9b,/Headquarters-3-
Headquarters net receipts12,     In order to give a clearer picture of the true &quot;burdenof stationing costs and equipment costs, a large part ofthe receipts has &quot;been re-allocated to these headings, as explained above.     In addition the payment by the Ministryof Technology for the use of facilities in Australia,hitherto treated as a stationing cost, is here treated asa headquarters payment.     The result is that the net receiptso:C  61 M becomes a net expenditure of  3M.     The notionalcost of  1 OM for the -foreign excha*nge&quot; cost of oil for theforces has been omitted in accordance with the line takenin paragraph 4,Cojiclusions13, The conclusions from this analysis are that in1967/68:a. the net level of stationing costs is about 100M (paragraph 8);b. on equipment we are in credit (paragraph 9);c. on other Government transactions there is adebit of  31 (paragraph 12);d. on the basis of the NATO definitions of equipment transactions the net debit ona., b. and c. is almost balanced by thereceijits from other sales of def enc e equip-ment by industry (paragraph &quot;11).
APPENDIX ISTATIONING- GO-ITS AND U.IC.  IMPORTSThe table assesses the minim-am saving to the directUK import hill resulting from the fact that some 320,000members of the forces and their dependants are stationedoverseas at the expense of the Defence Budget,20     The figures are calculated on the basis that 2Cfo ofthe increase in total final spending on the U.K. economy is reflected in increased imports.     This is broadly theformula contained in August 1965 edition of EconomicReview in an article entitled &quot;Forecasting Imports&quot;prepared by W.A.H. G-odley and J.R. Shepherd of H.M. Treasury.3.     The figures given in column (1) are stationing costsnet of the pay of locally engaged civilians.     It might be argued that this pay should not be deducted, becausecorresponding services would have to be purchased in the uk if the forces were repatriated, but the deduction hasbeen made in order to reflect the fact that in general themaintenance of living standards overseas is somewhat more costly than in this country.ko     This assessment of the theoretical effect of repatria-tion on UK imports takes account of &quot;first round&quot; efiectson the UK import bill only.     There would in practice be amultiplier effect consequent on this direct increase inconsumer spending, and to this extent the table belowunderstates the net effect on the UK import bill.     On theother hand it could be argued that allowance should be madefor the effect of increased imports on the demand for our exports, but this effect is likely to be relatively small.(1) &apos;* (2)Stationing Costs Estimated increase to less pay of UK imports generated,PJ^.gXS-G-9:.s-.-QAyi.litgJls     by rise in total finalspending	  M	  MGermany	60	12.0Gibraltar	lul	0.8Libya	1.6	0.3Malta	8	1 .6Cyprus	12.2	2.kAden	9.2	1.9Malaysia	15.1	3.0Singapore	kh.5	9.1Hong Kong	9.1	1.8Persian Gulf	10.8	2.2Rest of 17.

APPENDIX IIThe table in paragraph 3 assesses the gain to UKexports which accrues from our overseas military expendi-ture.2.     The figures are based on the knowledge that thecountries concerned have a propensity to spend a relativelyconstant percentage of their GNP on goods of UK origin,and on the assumption that the increase in GNP generatedby the British military presence causes imports from the uk to rise in the same proportion.3.     It also takes account of the multiplier effect where-by a sum of money spent on an economy gives rise to asequence of transactions.:enerates an increasein GKP which is not purely an arithmetical addition,otudies of the size of the multiplier factor in a few ofour overseas theatres have produced varying figures, butfor the purpose of the calculation a modest 1.5 has beentaken throughout in order to avoid any possible overstate-ment of the net effect on UK . sports.C MCountryUK Exportsas % of.N.P.UK overseasexpenditure1967/68ore castAmount of   EstimatedGNP gene-   minimum gainrated in to UKhost economy ExportsGermany	1%	80	120	1 .2Gibraltar	3%;	6	9	3.1Libya	17%	2	3	0.5Malta	30Jo	10.5	&quot; 16	4.8Cyprus		15.5	23	3.2Aden		11	16.5	2.3Singapore	12^	56.5	85	10.2Malaysia	5.5V	17.5	26	1 MHong Kong	1 2%	11	16,5	2.04.

-2-The only one of those areas for which a &quot;broad assessmentcan &quot;be made is the Persian Gulf, for which, on the analogy of Aden, a tentative figure of S2M has &quot;been included.Although there are undoubtedly similar exports generated&quot;by the remaining expenditure (possibly with the exceptionof that in Nepal) no claims have been included in this paper in view of the difficulty of assessing a figure.5,     There are, in fact, several reasons why exports whichowe their origin to UK overseas expenditure are probablyhigher than the figures shown in the table.a. It is likely that UK personnel stationedoverseas have a bias towards UK goods.b. The fact that certain commodities sold onthe local economies are stocked in themain to satisfy the demand of UK personnelgives rise to the possibility that localdemand for such commodities would not haverevealed itself without the presence ofthe forces demand.c     The multiplier factor is probably under-stated in some cases.6.     It is worth noting that the factors mentioned in a.and b. above would, of course, operate in reverse in theevent of withdrawals,  thereby depressing UK exports by anamount which would be greater than the present gain shownin the table.7.     It could be argued hypothetically that the Governmentsof the countries affected might well direct new public spending to offset the decline in GNP and thus, as a by-product, lessen the decline in UK exports.     Though suchan assumption might, in certain political end economicconditions, be valid for an advanced economy such as thatof Germany it is certainly not true for the bulk of theexpenditure here considered.
