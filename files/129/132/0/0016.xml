C(67) 13621st July, 1967COPY NO.    6 cjCABINETTHE OIL. SUPPLY situation memorandum by the Minister of PowerSupplie sThe supply position is improving slightly.    In general, it remains a tanker problem but this is being eased somewhat by the growth of exports from Libya and the Levant pipelines.   There are signs thatLibya is increasing the number of countries (other than the United Statesand United Kingdom) to which it permits exports;  Iraq has confinedexports to certain countries in Southern Europe.    This means that southern Europe, including France - which throughout has drawn supplies from Algeria - will immediately be better off than Northern Eux-ope,including ourselves.    The main oil companies through their supplyprogrammes are adjusting for this as fast as possible;  though tankerrerouting imposes delay, the rearranged pattern of supply is now settlingdown.2.      For the United Kingdom itself, the Arab ban remains in being, andwith Nigerian oil exports stopped, supplies are being programmed to us from Venezuela, the United States of America, and Iran, where production has been stepped up to the limit.    Of our three main suppliers, accounting for three-quarters of our imports. BP are relying on Iran;  Shell on iran and Venezuela;  and Esso on Venezuela and the United States of America.I shall keep in close touch with the companies to see that the United Kingdomgets at least its fair share of deliveries.    So far it is satisfactory thatthey have been able to arrange this despite the ban on United Kingdom and united States destinations.    On exports, I am discussing with the oil companies how best to strike a balance between our immediate needs (tokeep oil here and to import products from overseas refineries) and our long-term interest in keeping export outlets.    The industry will beincreasing product imports?  some useful amounts, I hope, will be drawn from Italian refineries running Libyan crude but this will have to be donediscreetly and perhaps indirectly, to avoid risk of Libyan counteraction.The Russians have again refused to supply us.United Kingdom Stocks3.      The improved supply prospect was reflected in the estimate of stocks as at end-September which I circulated earlier this week(C(67) 134).    I shall have revised estimates in time to report them orallyto my colleagues when we meet.    The end-September forecast, although5 million tons or nearly a third below normal, is not critical, and since-1-gMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
some smaller companies have not yet received programmes from their foreign parent companiess it is, if anything, a cautious estimate.    Wemust bear in mind also that in addition the Government holds in stockabout five days&apos; supply against just such an emergency as the present.Particular Products4.       I attach in an annex the stock position product by product.    Theseare companies&apos; stocks, and they reveal no immediate cause for anxietyexcept over naphtha and fuel oil.    The naphtha position is very serious.In the Western world there is an absolute shortage at the present time.Naftamondial, the Zurich oil traders, have had their proposal to supplyRussian naphtha via Rotterdam turned down by the Russians.    The firstreaction from Rumania has been that there is probably nothing availablefor the rest of this year (but v/e still await their considered advice).United Kingdom refiners are maximising their production but nevertheless the oil industry may shortly have to cut its customers in the UnitedKingdom by an average of 20 per cent.    Consultations are being pressedahead with our tv/o main consumers (the Gas Boards and the petrochemicalindustry) on the use of alternative fuels and how best to apportion the short supplies of naphtha,5.       Fuel oil stocks still give some grounds for concern in view of the much greater demand expected in the winter, when stocks are normallyrun down.    The industry is planning to draw extra supplies from theWestern Hemisphere, and this should shortly be reflected in the forwardstock position.Price s6.       I have had no application for a further price increase, though we know that not all companies were fully covered by the recent increase.Overall, the price increases on the Continent have been of the same order as here but with considerable variations e.g. a good deal higher in western Germany and much lower in France and Italy.    I shall need tokeep a close watch on the price situation to ensure that our domesticprices are right in relation to the companies1 costs in the United Kingdomand to price levels in Europe which could, if they rose steeply, tend todraw off supplies from the United Kingdom market.The Immediate Future7.       Hitherto the oil industry has been concentrating on the immediate and critical task of rerouting supplies to get oil flowing in the maximum possible quantities to this country, and the supply and stocks forecastmade by my Oil Industry Emergency Committee have been related to thecurrent quarter (end-September).    This is a short period, especially with the approach of winter, on which to base decisions on petrol rationing or the restriction of industrial oil consumption,    I have therefore asked the OIEC to provide by the end of this month its bestestimates of the position at the end of the year.-2-
Balance of Payments8.       Officials of the Departments concerned have examined thebalance of payments costs.    Their present estimate is that if thedislocations last f or six months i. e. till the end of November, theadditional cost to the United Kingdom balance of payments would beabout  85 million, of which some  15 million would fall in 1968.    Thelargest item in these costs is the charter of tankers (almost whollyforeign-owned) at very high rates, but the purchase of some high-costoil in the Western Hemisphere is also allowed for.    The estimate takes account of the effects for the business of British oil companies overseas,where Shell hope to recover the extra cost of supplies and perhaps evendo better, while BP are likely to fall short by  10 million or so ofrecovering costs.    My officials are keeping these estimates under continuous review as the situation develops and are consulting with otherDepartments and with the industry on measures which might minimisethese balance of payments costs.9.      I also arranged for officials to consider whether even if suppliesprove adequate, rationing and other restrictions of consumption mightnevertheless be desirable on balance of payments grounds.    Theyestimate that in the period September (the earliest the restrictions couldbe introduced) to November, about  15 million might be saved on oilaccount by the restrictions mentioned in paragraphs 10 and 11, and about 25 million by more severe cuts, especially on industrial fuels.    On theother hand, the effect of the cuts on industry in general, while incapable of close calculation, could easily be so great as to result, through a fallin exports, in a net loss to the balance of payments.    Thus restrictionsare not recommended on balance of payments grounds.Restriction of Consumption10.      This is the position against which we have to judge whetherimmediate action is required to introduce measures to ration motor fuelor restrict industrial oil consumption.Planning for petrol rationing is far advanced and the scheme couldbe launched from the end of this month.    Before rationing becomeseffective a six week period i3 required for the issue of ration books andfor dealing with applications for supplementary allowances.    Rationingcould not therefore become effective before mid-September, and onlythen if we announce immediately that the final preparatory steps are tobe taken and coupons issued.    If we did this it would not of course commitus to ration in mid-September, though it would be widely assumed thatthis was the intention.11.       Restrictions on indtxstrial oil consumption would be handled bythe oil industry under my instructions.    The scheme would be to reducedeliveries to industry by a given amount - probably 10 per cent initially.Before it could be introduced there a.re two further stages of planning tobe undertaken, first, completion of the central planning, which will takeanother two weeks and will proceed in any event;  and second, thepreparation of detailed delivery schedules by the oil industry, whichwould take about foiir weeks.    This scheme also could not be introduced before early or mid-September,
12,       On the basis of the supply and stock position and the industryJsforecasts to end-September I do not think it is necessary to go ahead atonce v/ith the issue of ration books in preparation for rationing petrolfrom mid-September.    Stocks of petrol at the end of September are estimated at only Z\ weeks below normal and, if rationing were introduced,the savings from the cuts envisaged would amount to a reduction of no more than 4 per cent or thereabouts in total sales of oil products.    Withdemand declining in the winter months there might even be a risk that a surplus of petrol v/ould arise resulting in a cut back in refinery runs anda reduction in the supply of other very important products including naphtha.13.       On industrial fuel, the central planning by the oil industry forrestriction of consumption should certainly be completed, and I can thenreview early in August whether the supply situation makes it necessary toproceed with the detailed scheduling of deliveries in preparation forrestrictions.Future Uncertainties14.       The broad rule of thumb is that some shortages are liable to occurwhen overall stocks get down to 7 or 8 weeks supply,,    I have asked forthe industry*s specific advice on minimum stock levels so that I can judge the need for restrictions with greater precision.    But there areof course unpredictable factors to be taken into account such as thepossibility of a very bad winter and of further deterioration in the oversea,s supply position.15.       On the latter possibility, this is more a matter for the foreign secretary,    An extreme case v/ould be if Arab oil exports would againcease altogether, as they did for a short period in June.    A less extreme case would be the reclosure of the Levant pipelines and of the Libyanexport terminals.    Syria has a record of capricious behaviour, and in libya although the Government is increasingly in control of the situation the workers are subject to Egyptian and Algerian influence.    Tf this didhappen, the consequent tanker shortage v/ould reduce supplies to western europe as a whole severely.    Supplies, moreover, would be lost whiletankers were being rerouted.    Altogether, if these sources were lostfor, say, a month, a stockdraft of 10 to 14 days1 supplies might be needed to help meet normal demand.    It Nigerian oil were to begin flowing again in the last quarter of this year, the position would of course be verymuch improved,Conclusion16.       The general supply and stock situation has improved slightly inthe last week or so.    The exception to this is naphtha, on which urgentdiscussions are taking place with the oil, gas and petrochemical industries.I am quite clear that on present information there is no need to decidenow to introduce either petrol rationing or restriction of industrial oilconsumption; nor do I chink it necessary to start the issue of ration booksso as to be able to introduce rationing by mid-September.    However, thesituation remains precarious, and v/e shall need to review it again assoon as we have the oil industry^ forecast of the position at the end ofthe year.    If it shows a deteriorating trend it may be necessary to takethe final steps in preparation for restricting consumption,    I v/ill reportto the Prime Minister on the situation early in August when I have thecompanies1 end year forecasts,-4-
17c      As to the balance of payments aspects of the problem, the dangerof damage to industrial production from restricting supplies would seemto outweigh the savings on foreign exchange expenditure on oil supplies.I do not therefore think that we should introduce rationing on this account,since it might do more harm than good.    We shall however have toconsider very carefully what guidance to give to the oil industry on itsrestocking problems so as to strike the balance between security ofsupply and further strain on the balance of payments.    Officials are working on this.18.       I invite my colleagues to agree that I should proceed on theseline s.R.W.M.Ministry of Power. S.W.1,20th July, 1967-5-SEGREi
