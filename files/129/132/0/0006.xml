C(67) 12610th July, 1967CABINETTHE Oil, SUPPLY SITUATION AND THE UNITED kingdom note by the Minister of PowerSupply interruptions to date.       For about a week after 6th June oil was not being loaded at allin the Middle East save in Iran and some of the Gulf Sheikdoms.    Exportsthen slowly restarted from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the otherSheikdoms.    In the last week exports have begun once more from Iraqvia the Levant pipelines and from Libya, but only to certain destinations.In Libya loadings are still impeded by labour unrest.    The Suez Canalof course remains closed.    Except for Oman (see paragraph 11) allArab oil states have a ban on exports to the United Kingdom and theUnited States of America, and some of them to Western Germany.    Inthe last week Nigerian exports have been stopped.The normal system of supply2.       Annex I gives some broad statistics of the normal oil situation.3.       The px-oduction and movement of oil is not arranged between governments save for the comparatively small amounts of Russian oiland the provision of Algerian oil for France.    The great bulk of supply is organised by the oil companies, each with its own crude supply andtanker fleet and in competition in the markets with all the other suppliers.This is a massive operation: for example, the Shell Group world-widefleet alone, both owned and chartered, which is co-ordinated from theirhead office in London, numbers about 450 tankers amounting to over15 million deadweight tons (d. w. t. ).4.       The spread of crude oil sources, together with their centralisedco-ordination, means that the industry has considerable flexibility tomeet supply problems.    Each company looks at its supply system area by area (for example taking its European market as a whole) ratherthan country by country.    The main movement into Europe is of crude oil, but there is also a movement of product in and out of Europe, and within Europe between individual countries, in order to balance demand and supply for specific products.G 4COPY NO.      u JDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)
Effect of the interruptions5.       The underlying problem is one of tanker capacity.    The shut-off of oil - at the time of writing, most (still) of Iraq and Libya and also of nigeria - could be made up from other sources.    But the closure ofthe Canal (normally taking 170 millions tons of oil a year) and, until this week, the closure of the Levant pipelines, means that the tankerfleets are not enough to bring round the Cape all the oil available for loading in the Persian Gulf.    This is notwithstanding the recall ofvessels from lay-up and other employment - BP alone has charteredover Zj million d.w. t. additional to their normal fleet of 8 million tons.The situation has been complicated by the refusal (or reluctance) of anumber of Arab states to accept United Kingdom flag tankers.6.       To make the best use of tanker capacity, some of the tankersen route to the United States of America at the time of the stoppage werediverted to Europe, and companies are now getting additional supplies from Venezuela and the United States of America (a much shorter haul,though the oil itself is more expensive).    The build-up of additional supplies is a matter of weeks rather than months.7.       Despite the measures taken, Western Europe is estimated tohave suffered a shortfall of about 30 per cent in June.    The shortfall in July will be not far short of this, but should reduce in August to about10-15 per cent.    In September, there should, on present estimates, bea further improvement to about normal levels.OECD8.      Effective co-operation between oil companies is important inorder to maximise supplies to us and to Europe.    Standing arrangementsexist to secure this under the aegis of the Organisation for economic co-operation and Development (OECD), as a result of which the USA isable to give anti-Trust clearance to American oil companies to pooltheir resources with other companies.    There has been a delay inactivating this machinery, due largely to French obstruction, but thearrangements are now going forward (Annex II).The United Kingdom position9.      In spite of the Arab ban on loadings for the United Kingdom, ourown position has not been markedly different from that of other countriesin Western Europe save France.    Algeria has throughout maintained .supplies to France, which is now aided further by the release to them of exports from Iraq (through the Levant pipelines) and from Libya bypermission of the Governments of those countries.    Iraq and Libya oil isnow being allowed also to other countries - Italy, Spain, Greece and turkey.    While the ban on the United Kingdom remains, the restartof these exports does not help us directly, but it does do so indirectlysince the shorter hauls will increasingly release tanker capacity.
SECRET 6 310.     On the other hand, the stoppage of Nigerian oil now adds afurther difficulty in programming supplies for the United Kingdom.With the Arab ban on supplies to us our sources were reduced toVenezuela, the USA, Nigeria and, in particular, Iran where production has been maximised to 20 per cent above normal.     The industrydiverted to us supplies from those four countries, switching to othersthe Arab oil we used to get.    Now the industry has had to re-routetankers yet again in order to secure replacement supplies for Nigerianoil.    But with the release of tankers resulting from the easing of theposition described in paragraph 9, our position is not likely to beworsened once the re-routing takes effect,11.     A small but useful production is now starting in Oman whereShell have a concession.     The Sultan has no objection co exports tothe United Kingdom.      By the middle of September this should beproviding about 10 per cent of our normal supplies.     The shorter haulsfrom the USA and Venezuela will be used to an increasing extent.Blocjnl12. I shall report orally to the Cabinet on the possibility of suppliesof oil from countries of the Communist Bloc.13.     At the beginning of June, I reactivated the Oil IndustryEmergency Committee (OlEC) which advises me in emergency on oursupply and stock position.    Although this is a special committee ofthe industry, members of my Department take a direct part in its work.Stock levels are reassessed weekly.     The 7th July assessment is;-26th        3rd 31st        31st 30th&quot;LUB^.

When stocks fall below 7-8 weeks, local supply difficulties and difficulties with particular products begin to arise.     Overall, theindustry is hopeful of no run-down in stock in September, but thesituation will be tight because the stock at end-September will be6j million tons below normal for the time of year.15.     Within the total stock, the position of individual products varies -see Annex III attached.    The product of immediate concern is -naphtha,a kind of gasoline which is a vital feedstock for the gas and chemical industries.    It was already in short supply world-wide before the crisis.Loss of refinery production (due to lower crude oil arrivals) and theswitch to different crude oils have forced the leading supplier (Shell -Mex/BP) to cut deliveries by 15 per cent during July  and August.The stock forecast for end-September shows that Naphtha will then be only 4 weeks.    My Department is investigating urgently with the oil companies how to cover the shortfall; Russian oil will I hope play a part.Fuel oil at l\ million tons will be 2jr million tons below normal, but the oil industry plan to increase both production and imports.     We will need to encourage the industry to bring in sufficient supplies from Septembernot merely to prevent stocks falling further but to improve them in orderto help meet the higher winter demand which is normally partly met by drawing down stocks.R.M.Ministry of Power, S.

APEX II    &apos;OECD1C     At the time of Suez, arrangements were made under the OECD for specialco-operation by the oil companies to maximise supplies and for the fairapportionment between European countries of the overall shortfall.     TheOECD has since maintained emergency arrangements for similar measures in another crisis.2.     The United Kingdom chairs the OECD Oil Committee and called a meetinglast month, as the agreed arrangements provide should be done in a supplyemergency.     The French, however, opposed the meeting on the grounds thatit might exacerbate the Arab Governments further;   their real reason was nodoubt their general policy of dissociating themselves in Arab eyes from theUnited States and the United Kingdom.   The position was made worse by united States insistence that they needed a formal OECD declaration ofan emergency to froe their companies from anti-trust restrictions onco-operation between them and non-United States companies.     Tho OECDCouncil eventually passed a resolution which avoided formal declaration ofan emergency but still enabled an oil industry advisory body, includingUnited States companies, to be set up,    France, Turkey and Germanyabstained, the latter on grounds that they could not risk offending ArabGovernments under Russian pressure to recognise East Germany.     The oil industry body met on 7th July;   in the event French and German companiesjoined,3.     The OECD Oil Committee is to meet early in the week beginning17th July when it will receive advice from tho industry body on tho supplyoutlook for member countries.     The setting up of the industry body will help tho companies, including the American companies, to co-operate more effectively in maintaining supplies generally, especially through poolingarrangements, (and to the United Kingdom in particular).Ministry of Power,Thames House South,Millbank, S.W.1.8th July 1967
