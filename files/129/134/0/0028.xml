RACE RELATIONS legislation memorandum by the Minister of labour I wish to make suggestions on three points in the Home Secretarylspaper (C(67) 196).I    The Crown (Paragraph 10)2a       The Bill is to bind the Crown,    Is it intended that this should cover the police?    It hardly seems right to cover other services forwhich Ministers are responsible if the police (including the MetropolitanPolice) are not covered.3.       If the Crown is to be bound it will be necessary to provide forspecial procedures for handling complaints.    It would not be appropriate for me to handle employment complaints against other Ministers;   and forcomplaints against Ministers who provide services a procedure modelledon that of the Parliamentary Commissioner would probably be appropriate.4.       To include procedural modifications in the Bill would weaken itsimpact.    Would it not be preferable, therefore, for the Crown to submitits actions to the scrutiny of the Race Relations Board, not in the Bill,but by the more usual practice of a Government undertaking?JX   Small Employers (Annex I, Paragraph 10)5.       I agree that the Bill should not apply initially to the smalleremployers so as to give the machinery for handling complaints a chance to get run in.    But would it not be desirable to make it clear to all employers that they will eventually be covered by providing, in theBill, that the lower limit will be reduced to five employees after twoyears and removed altogether after three?HJ    Machinery for Handling Employment Complaints (Annex I, Paragraph 20)6.       It is essential that the machinery for handling employment complaintsshould have the confidence of industry, and in particular of the confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress.I think the best way of achieving this would be to appoint the Presidentof the Industrial Court ex officio Vice-Chairman of the Board and tomake him responsible for the machinery for handling employmentcomplaints,,Ministry of Labour, S.W.1,19th December, 1967DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67) 199 COPY NO.^_19th December, 1967CABINET
