COPY NO.SCOTTISH TEACHERS&apos;   salaries memorandum by the Secretary of State lor ScotlandScottish teachers&apos;  salaries are due to be revised with effect from april 19680     It will be necessary for the management side offer to befed early in January in the negotiating committee,, and I seek thecement of my colleagues to my proceeding on the basis set out in thisiorandum.Under the new machinery set up under the Remuneration of Teachersatland) Act 1967 my position is the same as that of the Secretary ofIte for Education and Science in relation to teachers&quot;  salaries inland and Wales, he., through my representatives on the management sideave control of the overall cost of an offer to the teachers but I havecontrol orer the way in which an increase is distributed.     I am boundagreements reached and, failing agreement, I am also bound by thegsiings of the arbiters unless national economic circumstances requireit effect should not be given to an arbitration award, in which eventIrmative resolutions are needed from both Houses of Parliament.I have come to the conclusion that the right cgement side offer based on an overall increaselary bill, with authority to go up to 8 per centbring about a settlement.     The offer on salarieompanied by proposals, on lines already endorsedeme of supplementary payments to certain teacherstribution of the teaching force in favour of thee cost of this inducement scheme is equivalent tothe salary bill.      It is to these two proposalslould like to have the agreement of the Committee.course is to have theof 7i&quot; per cent, in theif this were seen likelys as such would beby the Cabinet, for as in order to improve the worst-staffed areas:about 0.75 per cent,taken together that IWith effect from 1st April 1966 Scottish teachers were given anl^ease of 13 per cent, over salaries fixed in 1963.     This settlement[s imposed by me in face of one involving an overall increase of 15 perfit. recommended by the Scottish Joint Council.     Teachers in EnglandP Wales had been given an average increase of 13 per cent, with effectl0ra 1st April 1965, and the National Board for Prices and IncomesB.P.I.) were asked to report whether, on an overall comparison, theper cent, increase proposed by the Government for Scottish teachers8 such as to put them generally into a fair relationship with teachersEngland and Wales.     In May 1966 N.B.P.I. reported iyi the sense that one basis of an overall comparison there were no grounds for varying thetPer cent, award, and this award was made final in regulations issued in^ 1966 with effect from 1st April 1966 to last until 31st March 1968.1 .3IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
In their report (No. 15, Cmnd. 3005) N.B.P.I. challenged thelidityof the concept of an overall comparison &quot;between salary increasesScotland and. in England and Wales and suggested instead that futurettlements should be based on analysis of the particular problems of the separate education systems.     They also recommended that the timing oflary revisions in the two countries should be brought into phase.The forthcoming revision relates to the salaries of teachers employededucation authorities in primary and secondary schools and in furtherucation colleges.     The current basic scales are set out in the Appendix;addition to basic salary teachers in posts of responsibility receivelowances of varying amounts related to the measure of responsibilityvolved.     The salaries of teachers in colleges of education aretermined by me in the light of separate negotiations but traditionallye measure of increase has been the same as the overall increase settledr teachers in schools and further education colleges.in considerartions the teachers&apos;1&apos;  side claim has just been tabled:    it involves ancrease of some 20 per cent,, and there is obviously no prospect ofeting a claim of this order.     The problem is to devise a basis for theuagement side offer which is rational and defensible and consistent withe needs of the situation and with considerations of incomes policy.An essential feature must be a significant upward revision of Scale 7,ich runs from  680 to  1 ,3/4.0 (1k increments).     This scale manifestlyfolves a salary which is indefensibly low.     Hitherto teachers paid on itve in the main been women non-graduate three-year college of educationined teachers in primary schools (15^200 at present);    in additioncondary school teachers of technical subjects with no more than basicalifications have been paid on it (some 300 at present).     From thisssion, however, men are now admitted to the three-year course forimary teachers and it is most important to encourage recruitment fromis source *     It is plainly impracticable to seek to perpetuate thelatively low salaries payable on this scale.     The employing authorities11 certainly consider a significant improvement of Scale 7 essential;j wanted to improve it in 1966.     Because of the large number of :achers involved an improvement of Scale 7 is inevitably costly.Some improvement must also be given on the other scales, includinge further education scales.     I could not defend leaving the othesrles as they are when English teachers got 7 per cent, this summer and in we set so much store, last time, on keeping the teachers in bothttntries. broadly in line.     I would have liked to bring about sometipnalisation of the structure of Scottish salaries, both in schools*ols&quot;in...further education, hut this would be too costly at present.We are, of course, publicly committed to go ahead with the scheme ofucement payments for teachers in schools designated as schoolsPiously affected by the staffing shortage.     This involves an additionsalary at the rate of  100 per annum to the teachers concerned - atal of k,000 out of k1,0000it The local authority associations&apos; representatives cannot be expected[agree to the making of an offer unless it can be seen to bear somelationship to the realities of the situation and to be such as can befended in arbitration..     As I have said, the essential elements in this a significant improvement in Scale 7S a lesser improvement in theer scales, and additional moneys to implement the scheme of inducementents in the shortage schools..     If the cost of the inducements schemeto be met out of the amount otherwise available for a general salaries2.
rision I am clear that neither the local authority associations&apos;presentatives on the management side nor the teachers will accept myoposals.     It must he kept in mind that although these inducementspments are in my view extremely important, it is inherent in theirture that they benefit only a small minority of teachers and offer notraction to the great majority of education authorities, since theynefit only the few in whose areas there are critical shortages,ither the local authority associations on the management side or theachers would accept any suggestion that, in effect, teachers generallyould bear the cost of the scheme.     There has all along been anpectation that the cost of the scheme of inducement payments would bet separately and additionally..   The improvement of Scale 7 for which I must provide involves pitchingat something like  750- 1 ,U50 (the Burnham basic scale is  800- l ,500),i this means an overall increase on this scale of about 10 per cent,asonable improvement on the other scales means an increase on average of out 6 per cent, on them.     The overall increase in the salary bill forimary and secondary teachers is on this basis about 7*5 per cent,is seems to me to match very reasonably the 7 per cent, increaseithorised for teachers in England and Wales in terms of the arbitrationard effective from 1st July 1967.i,   I have in mind that the increase I propose should be for two years,e., to 31st March 1970.     This v/ould mean postponement of the time whenlary revisions in Scotland and in England and Wales are brought intoase as recommended by N.B.P.I.     I am not in principle against a one-ar settlement for Scottish teachers but I would be opposed to this if; meant pitching the measure of increase at an appreciably lower figurean I have proposed above since this would make it impossible to deviseviable management side offer.     I would myself prefer to see the salaryittlements brought into line after a reference to the Prices and Incomeslard of salaries in both countries.inclusioni.   I ask my colleagues to agree that, through my representatives on theInagement side, 1 should proceed on the basis set out above, i.&apos;e. that theInagement side offer should be related to an overall increase in theilary bill of 7g per cent., with authority to go to 8 per cent, if thisI seen likely to bring about agreement in the negotiating committee;m that this should be accompanied by the scheme of inducement paymentsia shortage schools as an additional item amounting to about O.75 per centI the salary bill.W.R.tottish Office,aitehall,ondon, S.W.1 .^December^ 19.67 *
