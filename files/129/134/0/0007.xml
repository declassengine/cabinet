BRITISH EUROPEAN AIRvAAYS RE-EuUIFidENTIdemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeBritish European Airways (BSA), having been refused permission to buy the Boeings they wanted, asked last February for authority to order30 of a new type of British aircraft, the BAC 2-11, with an option on afurther 10,     This proposal called for a great deal of study;  but the main issues as explained in the memorandum by officials (Appendbc to C(67) 176)are now sufficiently clear for me to make a recommendation to mycolleagues,    A decision is now urgently required both by BEA, whoneed to know whether they will be able to start introducing t he JidAC 2-11in 1972, and by the manufacturers of the BAC 2-11 and its possible rivals,2,      I believe that we should agree to let BEA have the BAC 2-11,    Ihave been influenced in this view not only by BEA&apos;s needs, but by widereconomic considerations.    Indeed, BEA&apos;s case by itself, strong thoughit is, might not carry the day for the BAC 2-11.    However it is in my viewsufficiently reinforced by industrial, technological and balance ofpayments arguments.3,      BSA themselves have powerful arguments on their side:(i) In 19S6 tliey were denied the aircraft of their choice (the Boeing727s and 737s).    The Minister of Aviation then indicated in the House,however, that the recoxximendation as to the British aircraft to be boughtinstead would be left to BEA.    Although the BAC 2-11 did not exist at thattime, there is no doubt that it is a better aircraft for their purposes,commercially and operationally, than any other British aircraft in thefield.(ii)  Operationally, BEA need an aircraft intermediate in size betweencurrent types of around 100 seats and the Airbus of 270 seats, both as astep towards the Airbus and to operate alongside it.     The BAC 2-11 of200 seats is the right size.(hi)  Commercially, a BEA fleet with the BAC 2-11 will attract moretraffic and hence (a.s explained in the memorandum by officials) will leaveBEA, in 10 years&apos; time, with a deficit of  20 million less than would afleet with the Trident 3B.(iv)  The BAC 2-11 will enable BEA. to continue as the leading Europeanoperator, even though in competition with airlines using American aircraft;and, as a consequence, to maintain high morale at all levels?  this isimportant if we are to press the airline for high productivity.-1-COPY NO.ivlENT IS THE PR.OPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MA. JEST VS GOVERNMENT)14th November, 1967CABINET
(v)  The probable alternative is the Trident 3B, which no-one else willbuy, which v/ill be less attractive and economic to operate, which v/illdeprive BEA of its pre-eminent position in Europe, and so lead to a generallowering of morale.4.      In a wider context, the BAC 2-11:(i)  Is the only new British aircraft with a prospect of export salesbringing in foreign currency.     The most likely figure (paragraph 14 ofthe official paper) is 60 overseas sales bringing in  130 million of foreign currency.(ii)  V/ould be the vehicle for the R3 211 aero engine which is expectedto be an outstanding example of &quot;new technology&quot;;   it provides the only means entirely within our control of keeping Rolls-Royce in the world market for civil aero engines, which have in the past been large foreign currency earners.    As is shown by the attached letter from Rolls-Roycethey very strongly support the BAC 2-11 project.(iii) The BAC 2-11 with the Rolls-Royce engine v/ill be substantiallyquieter than any of its rivals.    It would thus provide the first conspicuousstep in achieving our aim of reducing aircraft noise;  the Trident 3B, likethe Boeing 727, is a noisy aircraft.(iv) The airframe of the BAC 2-11 will provide development and production work for the British industry under its own and not Frenchleadership.5.      I recognise, however, that there are arguments against the bac 2-11,    These, with my comments on them, follow:(i) On 3EA&apos;s present plans for buying the BAC 2-11 they would havea smaller demand (15) for the European Airbus than under anyother course open to them.     Bub the only figure for BSA&apos;s demandfor the Airbus which has been discussed in negotiation with, theEuropean countries is 20.    It should be possible for BEA to recasttheir requirements by taking a smaller number of the BAC 2-11 anda larger number (say 20) of Airbuses.(ii) To the extent that the BAC 2-11 sold abroad, it might reduce thedemand for the Airbus from other uncommitted airlines.    Butthe BAC 2-11 is in closer competition with the Boeing 727 than with the Airbus and it is difficult to imagine that, if it is notdeveloped, its potential market v/ill not be filled by Boeings ratherthan by the Airbus,(iii) If wo develop it, the French would say that they doubted ourseriousness in pursuing the Airbus project and so that projectmight be wrecked.    But if we were able to announce both the bac 2-11 and a decision that, subject to the Airbus provingsatisfactory, BEA would take at least 20 of them, we shouldsurely go a long way toward removing French apprehension.(They themselves, after all, have allowed Air France to buyBoeings without being committed to the Airbus).
(iv)  Finally there is the weighty argument that the cost of the 3AC 2-11(in discounted terms some  GO million) is excessive in relation tothe benefit to 3EA (in discounted terms only  10 million to 20 million).    I recognise that if BEA&apos;s interests only were involved, these figures might be decisive despite the beneficial effect of the BAC 2-11 on BSArs status, and efficiency as anoperator.    But it is not only BEA&apos;s interests that are involved.I am much concerned at the magnitude of the risks that v/e shallbe running by staking so much on the Airbus.    (The proposedEuropean mini-Airbus seems to me altogether too nebulous a project to affect significantly our present decision).We cannot be certain that the Airbus project will be continued afternext summer.     The history of collaboration in European aircraftmanufacture does not inspire any great confidence, and anotherabortive venture at this stage would harm rather than promote ourargument about technological contribution.    If we deny BEA the bac 2-11, we should, if the Airbus is not a success, have no alternative but to equip thern for the future with American aircraft.Further, and even more serious, Rolls-Royce may have no firmbasis for developing a new technology engine - I understand thatthe rival American airbus manufacturers are now unlikely to reach a decision whether to use Rolls-Royce engines before next June.The BAC 2-11 would at the least represent an insurance policy -although an expensive one - both against failure of tho Airbusand for Rolls-Royce^ projects of developing a new technologyengine.    At the best it may well have a substantial value of itsown in preserving British leadership in two important technological-logical fields,6.      There is one other consideration that must be mentioned.    I haveno power to direct the Board to purchase any given type or number of aircraft.    BEA would no doubt comply if I were to ask them in writing to follow a specified course provided we settled at the same time thefinancial arrangements which will implement the undertaking given bythe then Minister of Aviation in August, 1966,    But v/e must be concernednot only with the artificially contrived financial results but with the operating realities they mask and BEA will certainly wish to make itclear where the responsibility lies.    Sir Anthony Milward has told methat he will insist on having such a request for publication.7.      I invite my colleagues to agree that we should make the BAC 2-11available to BEA.C. A. R. CBoard of Trade, S. V7.1.9th November, 1967
ANNEXTEXT OF A LETTER DATED 3RD NOVEMBER 1 967 FROM SIR DENHIN&amp; PEARSONOF ROLLS ROYCE TO SIR ANTHONY MIL17ARD OF BEAFollowing our telephone conversation, I am writing to outline to youour latest position and thoughts on the BAC 2-11,Ever since the requirements for a range of substantially largersubsonic aircraft became apparent, we have expressed a preference for thesnaller of the two ranges of engine size for the obvious commercial reason that the world market was likely to be substantially larger for the smallerengine.We always knew, of course, that in the event we would goenthusiastically for whatever size of engine was chosen by those aircraftconstructors who specified a Rolls Royce engine.     As of today the onlyaircraft project which has firmly specified a Rolls engine and for which government funding is available is the European airbus with the RB 207.As you know, we are trying very hard to sell the smaller size of engineas well and have made plans that have satisfied our potential pustomers ofour capacity to do both sizes.The Ministry of Technology are fully aware of these plans and havedetailed proposals from us for the development of both sizes of engine for application to the BAC 2-11 and an American three-engined aircraft in thecase of the RB 211.In addition to putting in firm proposals to the Ministry of Technologyfor the development of the RB 211 for the BAC 2-11 , we have strongly supported the ease for the BAC 2-11 with all the Ministers and Officialswith whom we normally deal in the Ministry of Technology.     I have alsospecifically written to the Minister of Technology confirming our support for the BAC 2-11.     Some of the arguments we have used with the Ministry of technology for support of the BAC 2-11 are as follows:1.   The BAC 2-11 fills a &quot;window&quot; in the present likely airlinerequirements.     We have supported this view by providing theMinistry of Technology with our detailed market survey.2.   We have emphasised the reduction in noise compared with ourrentaircraft.
3,.   we have stressed our belief that it is unlikely that an Americanconstructor would launch this size of aircraft in the foreseeable future, as we consider there is no likely American requirementdeveloping for some considerable time,4.   The launching of the KB 211 would definitely be of assistance toRolls Royce in their present competition for the three-enginedAmerican aircraft.     We have refuted the possible argument thatthis would be detrimental to our chances by our firm belief thatthe engine decision is now firmly in the hands of the Americanairline operators, rather than the constructors and that theformer ?;ould welcome the added assurance arising from a firmGovernment decision to proceed and another aircraft using the engine.5.   That Government money spent on developing the BAC2-11 would bringpositive returns in terms of export business, whereas money spenton any alternative aircraft for BEA is exceedingly unlikely todo so.There is no doubt that the Ministry of Technology&apos;s anxiety is that support of the BAC 2-11 v/ould weaken the chances for the European airbus.My own view is that the only way to minimise these anxieties is forBEA to commit themselves, concurrently with the launching of the BAC 2-11,to the purchase of a substantial number of European airbuses under the same conditions that Air France have committed themselves, i.e. that the finalspecification is satisfactory.In conclusion, I would want you to know that I have said nothing inthis letter, apart from the preceding paragraph, which we have not already said at one time or another to the Ministry of Technology.-ii-
