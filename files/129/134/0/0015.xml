jCDMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)65cm) 185 COPY NO.2 8th^ November, 1967CABINETPASSENGER TRANSPORT AND TRAFFIC;DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Minister of transport the attached White Paper on Passenger Transport completesthe series of White Papers outlining policies which will be implemented in the forthcoming Transport Bill.    The policies described have all been approved at various times by the appropriate ministerial committees ever the past year.    The main elements of the policiesset out in the White Paper may be summarised as followsj-(i)      The establishment of Passenger Transport authorities with members appointed by the local authorities intheir area.    These new statutory bodies will have theresponsibility for planning and in part providing thepublic transport requirements of our great conurbations.They will be set up immediately in the GreaterManchester, Merseyside, West Midlands and Tynesideareas.    Later they may be set up also in other areas.(ii)      The acquisition by the Transport Holding Company (THC)of the last big block of privately held bus companies,thus bringing virtixally all the main network of ordinarybus services into public ownership of one sort or another.    This purchase has now be^n completed by theTHC subject to the passing of the necessary legislation to extend their borrowing powers.(iii) The creation of a new National Bur. Company to run thenationally owned bus services in England and Waleswith a specific duty to co-operate with passenger transport Authorities in the reorganisation of bus services.(iv) The operation at the desire of the Secretary of State forScotland of a separate Scottish Transport Board whichwould be responsible for bus services and shipping services in Scotland.
(v)      The introduction of grants towards capital investment .in public transport.    There will be a 75 per cent grant for major schemes of investment in fixed capitalfacilities such as new or improved rail lines in the cities, new tube lines, bus stations and so forth.There will be a lower rate of grant (25 per cent) for thepurchase of new buses of improved design.    There willalso be an increase in the grant already made to the operators of the ordinary bus services as a refund ofpart of the fuel duty which they at present pay.(vi)      A scheme for the support of bus services in remotecountry areas which will be paid for as to half by thelocal authorities in the area and half by the Government.This will implement the main recommendations of theJack Committee which reported in 1961 on this problem.(vii)      The removal of the present anomalies which prevent localauthorities from arranging for concessions for their old people on local buses.     The payments for such con-cessions will however have to be met by local authoritiesif they introduce them and will not fall in any way oncentral Government.(viii)      A revision of the regulations affecting the hours of driving for bus and coach drivers which have remainedunaltered since the 1930s.     The date of introduction ofthese changes will have to be carefully considered inorder to avoid dislocation of public transport facilities.(ix)      The extension of the programme of research anddevelopment on which we have embarked.(x)      The placing of much clearer responsibilities on localauthorities for the management of traffic in their areas,with less detailed interference from centralGovernment.    But local authorities in the towns andcities will be expected to prepare urban transport plans which will fit in with their general development plans and will form the basis for decisions about investment in public transport facilities, roadworks and traffic management schemes.2.     I should call my colleagues&apos; attention to the consequence whichwill flow from the decision to establish a separate statutory Scottish transport Board.,     The THC Board had not known of our intention todo this when they approached me with the proposal to buy the BritishElectric Traction (BET) Group bus interests.    They regarded thepurchase as defensible on commercial grounds to bring all the majorbus companies under a single control.     However, they regard thetransfer of the Scottish Bus Group to a separate statutory body as sodamaging to the strength of the National Bus Company that they insisted that they would only proceed with the purchase of BET if I gave thema direction to do so.    I have power to issue such a special directionbut I should point out to my colleagues that it has never been used
before on a major matter.     In accordance with the decision of the ministerial Committee on Industrial Policy on 15th November i therefore promised THC such a direction if the Government proceeded with its plans for a Scottish Transport Board.    The purchase of theBET under a direction could however have political implications whenit became known - as it would have to be.3.     The y/hite Paper has been delayed because of the need to knowwhether or not the purchase by the THC of the BET Bus Group wouldbe achieved.    The successful conclusion of the negotiations last weekhas enabled our policy on passenger transport throughout the countryto be set in a satisfactory context.    In particular, it has made it possible to drop the provisions for compulsory acquisition of privatebus companies which were likely to create serious difficulties in the effective working of the new Passenger Transport Authorities,4. I ask my colleagues to agree to the publication of the white paper as soon as possible and to confirm that they wish s. Scottish transport Board to be established even though this involves giving a direction to THC.B0 A, C.Ministry of Transport, S. E. 1.27th November, 1967-3-

restricted18I pThe jiodern jRc^le of Pub1ic transport,    One of the most precious achievements of moderncivilisation is mobility.    It enriches social life and widensexperience.    To build mobility into the urban and rurallife of this crowded island without destroying the other elements of good living must be one of the major purposes oftransport policy.2.    If this is to be achieved, far-reaching changes inattitudes and administration will be necessary.    Theprovision of transport - whether public or private - can nolonger be considered in Isolation from other developments.It must be built in to the whole planning of our communitylife so that no factory is sited, no housing estate or1 overspill&apos; developed, no town re-planned without the implications for the movement of people and goods having been studied and incorporated from the outset.    In other words,transport must become the servant of the planners, not theirmaster.3.     It is for this reason that ministries, regional EconomicCouncils and local authorities are undertaking studies oftransport needs.    It is for this reason, too, that the new type development plans envisaged in the Minister of Housingend Local Government&apos;s proposed Town Planning legislation will treat the basic transport planning of the area as partof its general planning of the structure of the area.    Normust the needs of riiral areas be overlooked, where thedecline of public transport threatens to isolate many people in remote communities.4.    The problem is, however, most acute in the built-built-up areas.   Great Britain is basically an urban country;    nearly half our people live in large towns and cities and about80,- of them in urban areas.    The quality of urban life depends/toSlESTRSGTED
to a large extent on the excellence of the transport servicesavailable both to those who live in cities, and to thosewho seed to come there for work, shopping or pleasure.    Thefreedom to move easily about the city - to go places and see people - is something of great value in itself.    Yet thisfreedom can, if ill-used, do great damange to the quality of urban life.5.     She nature and hind of urban transport systems must bebased on our ideas of the hind of cities we want to develop.But city planning must be based on a realistic appraisal ofwhat can be provided in the way of transport investment.    Itis useless to devise a structure for a city on the basis that nearly all journeys will be made by car or taxi if thisdeaands an investment in highways so huge that the resourcesof the country cannot provide it.    So general planning andtransport planning must be carried out hand in hand.6.    All the studies carried out so far from the BuchananReport on./ards suggest that our major towns and cities canonly be made to work effectively if a new dynamic role is givento public transport as well as expanding the provision for private cars.    Unless we recognise this we shall pull down the centres of our towns in an attempt to remove congestion,and at the end of the day we shall find congestion still with us, and the character of our towns destroyed.    We haveneither the physical s ace nor the economic resources tore build our cities in such a form that all journeys can bemade by the use of private cars,    and in any case we must provide for the large number of people - the old, the young,the housewives, the poor, - who do not have the use of cars.7.    The provision of an attractive and efficient system ofpublic transport is therefore vital to deal with theiraraediate and pressing problems in our cities.    But we must/also
also see now far public transport could offer new opportunities in the renewal of our urban areas.    Theeattern of growth of London was largely determined by thebuilding of the suburban railways and tubes;    the structure of many provincial cities reflects the pattern of the firsttram-ways,    hew ra id transit systems for our major citiescould provide an attractive basis for new aatterns ofdevelopment.
II.   Tho principles off. organisation,    Pour main consequences flow from this approach.    In ahcfirst place the basic planning of local public transport isclearly a function of local rather than central government.It is local authorities who arc responsible for the planning of their areas ancl the development of their local roadnetworks;  and they cannot do those jobs effectively unless they also have control over the public transport in their area o2,    That is why the Government has rejected the idea ofestablishing nationalised area Passenger Transport Boardsresponsible to the minister of Transport and organising localtransport services independently of the local authoritiesin their area.    A clear distinction must be drawn betweenthe national transport network (designed to handle movement between cities) and the short-distance local movement of people which needs to be a local responsibility.3.    Secondly, investment in local public transport must begrant-aided by central L-r overrun en. t just as investment in theprincipal road network in the cities and towns receivesspecific capital grants of up to 75, - from the Exchequer.Otherwise the renewal and extension of public transportsysteins will be hold back, while the money available is concentrated on road schemes which are grant-aided.    but here again responsibility for deciding what public transportdevelopments are needed must rest in the first place on local communities.^    Thirdly, all the transport matters for which localauthorities are responsible - the improvement of the localroad network, investment in public transport, traffic management measures, the balance between public and privatetransport, - must be focused in an integrated urban transport/plan,
olan,which in its turn is related to the general planning for each area.    Otherwise a series of unrelated schemesv,ill come forward without a unifying policy; and it will bedifficult for central Government to see which investment-j,    fourthly j local public transport is no longer an appropriate activity for private companies whose duty is totheir shareholders.    Indeed it has long been recognised thatthe basic passenger transport services could only be effectively provided through public ownership - whether local or national.    Post of the major cities have establishedtheir own public transport services.    London&apos;s transport wasintegrated in a public Board in 1933&quot;    Since 19-U8 the british transport Commission and later the nationally-owned TransportHolding Company, as owners of the Tilling and Scottish Or/hipsof bus companies, has been by far the dominant provider  of bus services outside London and the big cities.    Today T.!I. &apos;, ,own la?000 buses and coaches and have a large share (averagetop) in the companies of the British PIectrie TractionGroup, which own 11,000 buses and coaches.    In all, 80;j of stage bus passengers in Great Britain are carried by publicly owned undertakings, and there is a substantial public stake in a great part of the remainder.    Less than 10p of suchpassengers are carried by wholly privately owned companies.6,.   The completion of this process of bringing the basicnetwork of local passenger transport services under public ownership and control will make possible a radicalrationalisation of the pattern of public transport.    It willalso enable the finances of public transport to be considered on a wider basis than the narrow financial interests of individual operators.    In particular the finances of rail and bus operation need to be considered together and not inentirely separate compartments.projects should be given priority.Ah.
7,    finally, the planning of public transport can only bedone intelligently over areas which make sense in transportterms.   This means that planning must cover not only alarge city or town but also the catchment area from which large numbers of people travel to the centre for work,shopping or pleasure.    Such an area is far larger than thatof any existing individual local authority outside London.Indeed it is clear that one of the major factors making for the reorganisation of local government is the need tocreate local authority units big enough to tackle the sort of problems, like transport, which they ought to tackle if local government is to survive as an effective force.    &apos;:nysuch change in local government structure in England anddcotland must, of course, await the report ox the LoyalCommissions on local government.    But the reform of localgovernment is a complex matter and may well take several years.    In the meantime the traffic situation in some ofthe major urban areas is so serious, and the prospects for public transport deteriorating so rapidly, that there organisation of the transport system cannot wait.
111. The reorganisation of nublic transportSections III to VI of this Paper set out tne Government&apos;su-fooosals for implementing these principles outside London.2,   First, powers are to be sought in the Transport Bill to seta0 by Order, Passenger Transport Authorities in any area whereit seems to the &apos;. inister they are required for the effectiveorganisetion and planning of public transport.     The traffico/oblems of the manor conurbations are already critics! and theircontinuously built-up area.:, call for unified planning of transportsnder a single Transport Authority.     Yet at ore sent they are served by a multiplicity of operators, large and small, whichinhibits the satisfactory - 1 arming of public transport in thesrea.    In the Greater Manchester Area, for example,  there are noIsss than eleven municipal bus operators with fleets ranging in size from over 1,200 down to 19.     In these areas,  moreover,suburban rail services play a substantial part in the movement of:3ak hour traffic;    and the full integration of the planning of rail and road services is a oressing need.     Here too the role of newfixed track transport systems to serve the whole area needs to be investigated thoroughly and cpiickly.     To meet these needs newtransport authorities must be set up to take responsibility overwhole area and for all kinds of transport, real, tube, busand ferry, as well as any new forms of rapid transit which may befeveloped.     It is therefore proposed as soon as the Billtecoaes law to proceed with the establishment of Passenger-transport Authorities in Great Manchester, kerseyside, the .7estglands and Tyneside.      Consultations will be held with the localwiorities concerned on the delineation of the area to be covered-y the -.&apos;f   . in each case.In much of the rest of the country the problems are less: and the future pattern of local government even lees clear,iste improvements can, however, be made by the effective/coordination
coordination of bus services on the lines of the agreements atpresent operating in Bristol, Plymouth and elsewhere.     the promotion of such agreements will be helped by the proposedacquisition by the T.H.C. of complete control of the B&quot;&quot;T Groupif bus companies.This will enableasingle national busundertaking to beestablished operating virtually all the basicnetwork-k of local bus services outside tne main cities innglsnd and daleso .The National Bus Company  /ill cooperatenth Passenger Transport Authorities in the organisation oftransport services in their areas.     And in the rest of thecountry it will rationalise the services which it operates andcooperate very closely with municipal bus undertakings.Ms coordination will be fostered not only by the TrafficCOiiiiiissioners&apos; licencing control, where appropriate, but alsothrough the degionol Passenger Transport Coordinating Committees.k.   In Scotland all the buses outside Glasgow, &quot;&quot;dinburgh, Dundeeand Aberdeen are already run by the ocottish Bus Group owned bythe T.H.C.     The Scottish problem is therefore different in naturefrom the problem in &quot;hagland and dales and separate proposalsfor ocotland including the establishment of a Scottish transport Board are described further below.
IV Pass^eijger^r&amp;jiswrt Authoritiesf.    The procedure for establishing Passenger transport authorities - and a description of their powers and functionsis set out in detail in Annex A.    The constitution of theIVIV-S is designed to secure two ends:    first, the controlof oolicy and finance by a body responsible to the localauthorities   in the area concerned and secondly the delegation 0p gay -:co ^ay management: to a professionaljxecative a -pointed by the controlling authority andanswerable to it.    The relations between the Authority andthe Jxecative will be similar to those between a ministerand a nationalised industry.    The Authority will be composed almost wholly of people appointed by the localauthorities.    It -/ill appoint its o aa Chairman, with theapproval of the Minister.    Since the Authority and theGovernment will oe working closely together on many aspectsof transport policy, with the help of substantialhtcheouer grants,  the ainister will appoint two or three members of the authority, but not more than one-seventh ofthe total member ship o2.     The Authority will appoint the  executive on such terms as it may decide.    It will settle the broad linesof lolicy,  including services and fares.    It will be forthe Authority to choose, therefore, whether it wishespublic transport in its area to be self-supporting or&quot;hether, in the interests of wider transport considerations,it wishes to assist it through precepts on the localauthorities in its area.    The Authority will be free to^rant concessionary fares throughout its area.3o     The viability of public transport will clearly beaffected by the extent to which it is related to thegeneral planning of the area which is the responsibility
R.ES i n 8CTED19of the local authorities who are appointing the members ofthe P.T.--0   The Authority and the  Jxecutive must thereforeoltii public transport as part of a unified plan for land use,highways and traffic managementodesjonsib.il it ip,s,,o  the ^jxecutive .g,     A major task for the Jxecutive will be to prepare a plan for approval by the Authority setting out its proposalsfor the development of a system of public transport capableof serving the needs of the area.    It will also be responsiblefor the  provision of services, either by operating themitself or by entering into agreements with British Railways,with the national Bus Company or other operators.    One ofits most urgent tasxs will be to reorganise the bus under-takings       in the area,    as an essential first step it -/illtake under its control all the municipal bus undertakingsconcerned.    Reorganisation  .111 also be made easier by thefact that all, or nearly all, of the other major bus under-takings will be in public ownership under the control of theNational Bus Company Aaich will bo given a statutory duty to cooperate with the P.      s.    This development now makes it unnecessary to give them the compflsory powers ofacpiisition originally visualised.A     The Passenger Transport Jxecutive will not however be just a bod/ to organise or ran bus services.    Its primaryjob iiill be to plan the public transport system of the area as a whole in the context of tne development and trafficplans of the local authorities.    The Jxecutive must compriseaen of vision and wide experience;    and they must employstaff skilled in the latest techniques of transport planning and development, not only by road but by all means oftransport.    It will be the job of the  Jxecative to work outyith the local authorities a practicable balance betweenprivate and public transport;    to integrate the bus and rail/service s
services in the area even though they are operated by different undertakings;    and to evaluate the costs and benefits of major new investment in public transportwhether in fixed track system reserved routes for buses orother use.6.     A first plan for the develop development of public trans ?ortanst be prepared by the dxec representative for approval by theAuthority and for publication within two years of theappointment of the   acecutive.    Such a plan set in the context of the develop pnont elans of local authorities will help the Sinister in deciding on the capital grants to be made tothe ibcec rtive for investment in major ne./ projects..Orj^organisation of the Executive &apos;s Own Undertaking7o     It will be the duty of the   Executive to regroup the municipal undertakings transferred to it (and any otherbus services which it may ac uire by voluntary negotiations)in a way which will enable them to operate with maximum efficiency.    The total number of buses owned by the-xecvcive in Greater ilanchester,   ;erseys.!.de and the   .estMidlands will be of the order of 2,000 or even more,although there is no evidence that tnere is any particular -optimum si^e of bus under talcing (the optimum size almost certainly varies considerably in different conditions)there is a general concensus of view in the bus industry that the problems of effective management steadily increasewhen the number of buses in an undertaking rises above,000.   Tnere is therefore no intention that the  Executiveshould organise the bus undertakings which come under itsownership in a single monolithic structure.    On the otherhand many of the existing municipal undertakings are clearlytoo small to be retained as individual units and  :ould betetter combined with others into units of a reasonable but still manageaole size.
3.    Although it will be for the Authority and. theExecutive to choose the organisation scheme which they think fit, there would clearly be advantages in grouping their assets in a number of subsidiary undertakings of a sizewhich can be effectively managed..    in the circumstancesof the conurbations this would, probably be of the order of500 - 1,000 buses.    These subsidiary undertakings could be organised as Companies wholly owned by the  hcecutive.    Theexecutive would natnrally control the general policy of the subsidiary companies and &apos;.vould make sure that there was fullintegration in the way in which they worked together.   but within such a general policy there would be plenty of room for the management of each undertaking to adopt policiesappropriate to its own local conditions.9.     Such an arrangement would, ensure that there was close contact between the subsidiary undertaking and the local community wnich it served.    It would be open to thedxecutive to appoint to the Board of Directors of these localundertakings some persons from the local authorities in theArea, particularly those which had previously been runningtheir o .n bus under takings.    In this way the existinginterest and pride in the local bus services would bemaintained in the new system;    and the undertakings them-selves would be more responsive to local needs.    Thearrangement would also ensure that each   subsidiary has a close link with those responsible for the traffic policies inits area, which can have so marked an effect on theefficiency and attractiveness of the bus services.10.   Seconclly the arrangement would ensure a much bettersystem of financial responsibility for the individual partsof the dxecutive&apos;s undertaking.     ^ach subsidiary would beexpected to produce its own financial accounts and wouldhave its own financial objectives set by the  Jxecutive/and
and the /authority.    The cost of operation may very wellvary widely over the whole area and it would he most undesirable for these variations to be mashed in an overallaverage for the whole of a very large undertaking.    Ifcosts in a particular part of the Area are relatively lowthen it will be right for the travelling public in that area to enjoy the benefits of such lower costs.-11.   This means that although the Authority will establish a general fares policy for the area as a -whole there is noreason why the individual and detailed fares scales ofparticular areas should be identical.    There should be room for local variation in the light of local conditions and costs.12.    In this way the   xecutive will be able to secure the substantial advantages of grouping the bus undertakings which it ovais in units of an effective and manageable sizewith clear financial responsibilities and yet retain thoseadvantages of management, centralised purchasing and othercommon services which spring from single ownership and control of broad policy.Agreement, ^ith the national Bus Company13.   The National Bus Company will own several individual companies operating in each of the first Passenger Transport;u?eas.   The Company will have a statutory duty to cooperatewith the Executives in the reorganisation of bus services in their .recs.    This could be achieved in some cases bytransfers of bus services between the two undertakings.- lternatively there will need to be working agreementsdesigned to solve the problems of severance while avoiding the irritating restrictions watch are often placed underthe present system on the way in which people inside and outside the area can use the different bus services.    The/agreement
agreement between the rJ.3.C. and the hcecutive must be ofa kind which provides for full integration on a financial basis satisfactory to both parties.id.   Although the agreement  ,ill not need the approval ofthe Minister details of it will be submitted to theMinister as part of the reorganisation plan for the areareferred to above,    full control of services in the area which will be exercised by the   executive in place of the traffic Commissioners    ill not be given to the   hcecutiveunless the Minister is satisfied that a reasonable agreement has been made with the national Bus Company.Agreement with British Railways15*   The suburban services operated by jjritish Railwaysplay a major part in the provision of public transport inthe conurbations particularly for the movement of commuters.These services must be integrated into the general pattern of transport for the area.    The  Acecutive will therefore begiven a specific duty to prepare an agreement with british railways wuich will set out the part which suburban railway services are to play in the comprehensive transport plan forthe area.    This agreement will need the approval of the? o i. o i-la16.   The precise nature of the agreements made by thehcecutive with British Railways will vary from area to area.The level of fares to be charged must be a matter forthe executive who will fix it in the light of their generalpolicy for transport in the area     (talcing account of 3.Rferes on related services).  Clearly a ?.T.A. will not beable to draw up an effective transport plan unless it is ableto influence the fares policy for all types of transport inits area.    It might, for instance, wish       to stimulaterail travel by fares concessions which would aid to the lossesmade on the services.    lioreover, it would not have the same/incentive
incentive to reduce the loss on rail services by integratingthem more effectively with other forms of transport if it did not have financial responsibility for that losses    Theultimate goal must therefore be for the P.T.A. to take responsibility for paying grants for any continuing losses onthe suburban rail services it decides are necessary as partof its comprehensive transport piano    But progress towards this goal will necessarily be slow and will only take placein the context of Government policy designed to give localauthorities greater financial help for public transport thanthey have at pre sent o    For this reason the Government willbe making special grants to executives in connection withtheir agreements with BoRe - details of which are set outinSection VIIoAgreements with other Bu^Jlpperators17o   Although the majority of sizebale bus undertakings willbe publicly owned, most of the small undertakings may remainin private hands.    The Executive cannot be expected to plantransport services in its area unless in,the last resort itcan control all area bus services.,    It is  therefore proposedthat powers at present exercised by the Traffic commisioners should be exercised by the executive018.   There will however be full protection for the positionof existing operators.    They will have the right to go on providing the services which they are now providing;    but theExecutive will be able if they think it necessary to revoke the permission to continue with a particular bus service ifthey are not able to secure the proper organisation of thebus services in the area without doing so.    But in such casesthe operator would be entitled to full compensation from theExecutive for any reduction in the value of his businesscaused by the withdrawal of his right to operate a particularserviceo    And if the withdrawal was such that it endangeredthe viability of the business he would be free torequire the Executive to buy the /wholeRFSTRICTPn
Eiole business at its market value and at any rate at notless than the value of the net assets owned &quot;by the business.19,   Once the Executive has worked out its plans forreorganisation they would be expected to make arrangements with individual bus operators similar to those described above with the national Bus Company.    These agreements would have to protect the position of the operator;    andthere would be provision in them for appeal to some independent person over disputes about their interpretation,preferably to the Traffic Commissioners who are experienced in such problems.Machinerppjfo^r Pegotiat ion and^ Cipnsul tat,,iprkP!d:JA--^Qd^ker^?0,   The Transport Bill will be laying on the Railways board the National Bus Company and the Scottish Transport Board a duty to consult the Unions with a view to setting up thenecessary machinery for consultation and negotiation withtheir workers on terms and conditions of employment,measures affecting safety, health, welfare, and proposalsfor improving efficiency.21.   A similar duty will be placed on Passenger Transportexecutives under which they will make agreements with theUnions to set up suitable machinery for the discussion ofthese matters.   And the Executive will have to report to theAuthority on the progress with such agreements.    Itspolicies will be set out fully and publicly in its statementof general policy.22.    In deciding on the persons to be appointed as membersof the Authority the Minister will take into account thedesirability of including among the members of the Authoritya person with special knowledge of the organisation ofworkers particularly perhaps in the Passenger Transport/industry
Industry.    It will be for the Authority and the Executivethemselves to decide how best to establish good relationsbetween workers and management in the individual.public transport undertakings owned by the Executive.    But theMinister would hope that they would see that the men andwomen involved would be able to discuss not merely the&quot;how&quot; but also the &quot;why&quot; of the changes which they are asked to accept as an essential means of providing the improved Public Transport system needed in the PT areas.Financial Position of PT Executives23.   The financial position of the Passenger transport executive will depend in the first place on the efficiencywith which they organise both their business and theiragreements with other operators.    The merging of thevarious municipal bus undertakings   will presentopportunities for reduction in the total cost of manage-ment, and for savings from the rationalisation of services.Nor will the PTE, whose role will be a planning one;require a large HQ staff.    In the longer term rationalisation-tion of garage and maintenance facilities, centralisedpurchasing ana standardisation of vehicles and supplies should also provide a source of significant economies.2k.   Moreovers for the first time public transport will beenjoying capital grants towards the cost of new transport facilities, including the cost of new buses, together witha reduction in fuel tax (see Section VII below) and these will inevitably reduce operating costs.25.   One of the most important factors affecting the running-costs and attractiveness of bus services is the traffic conditions in which they operate.    These are under thecontrol of the constituent local authorities of the PTA andit will therefore be within their own power to create the
conditions in which the service offered to passengers canbe improved and the strain on bus workers relieved.    so great is the importance of effective traffic management to the viability of bus services that the Minister ofTransport proposes to place full responsibility for traffic management on local authorities as described in Section X26.   The finances of PTAs will also be strengthened by theright it is proposed to confer on the Executive to carryon any activities in which they are qualified or equipped,to engage.    Pull details are given in the Annex .   these powers will enable the Executive to provide every type oftransport service and associated facilities needed to complement the basic public transport system and so improveits attractiveness and convenience for the travelling-public.27.   A major factor in costs is the level of wages andother payments made to employers.   At present there aresignificant differences in wage levels and conditions ofemployment in the various undertakings both municipallyand nationally owned.    The principle of commons conditionsof work for those engaged on comparable work is obviouslyright.    But it may well be thought that the conditions ofwork for bus staff are by no means identical throughoutthe whole of a Passenger Transport Area and it may be thatthere will be a case for paying premium rates in certain parts of the area, where conditions of work are mosttrying and consequently it is particularly difficult toobtain enough staff.    Clearly progress towards uniformity of conditions must depend, like all increases in pay, onthe rate of increase in productivity in the bus industry./&apos;J8.
28.   The Government does not therefore accept that theestablishment of PTAs and the transfer of municipal under-takingsto PTEs will lead to an increase in the cost ofpublic transport or to higher fares than would otherwisepe charged.    Whether public transport in these Areas isable to cover its costs or requires a rate precept willdeuend partly on the quality of the people appointed tothe Authority itself, partly on the management skills ofthe Executive they appoint, and partly on the readiness of the constituent local authorities to see that the traffic conditions in which buses operate are such that they can do their job efficiently.
v. miokpl bus company1    Although this is not ;l\vays recognised, - very large port of the network of ordinary bus services throughout the countryl! s for nearly 20 years been provided by undertakings which arenationally owned or in which there is a large public shareholding.Companies which are wholly owned by the nationalised TransportHolding Company (T.H. C.) own over 14*000 buses and coaches.     TheI.H.C. also owns an equal share with the British Electric TractionCompany (e1 ch owning from one-half to one-third of the shares) in nearly all the companies in the British Electric Traction Groupshich own about 11,000 vehicles.     although there are indeed some25,000 other privately owned public service vehicles in thecountry, only about one-cjuerter of them are mainly engaged in theoperation of ordinary &quot;stage&apos; bus services;;    the remainder areconcerned with long-distance coach services, tours end excursionsand contract hire work.     And although there are hundreds of smallcompanies engaged in this kind of work, only four privately con-trolled companies operating &quot;stage1  bus services outside the B.E.T.Group have more than 60 buses.2.   The Transport Holding Company took  the view that the controlty a single body of all the main bus companies would enable thatyto participate with each Passenger Transport Executive in thenecessary reorganisation of bus services without damaging theEconomic and financial viability of the bus companies which providet of the services outside the large cities.     The Governmentscared this view believing that the essential reorganisation ofpublic transport services based on the establishment of Passenger(fmsport Areas can be carried through most effectively if all thei3rge bus companies operating stage bus services in England and&apos;&apos;&apos;&quot;ies :re brought under national ownership by the purchase by agree-&apos;-efrt of the remaining privately owned shares in the major busc*panies./Otherwise,
Otherwise, safeguarding of the financial interests of theindividual private shareholders could he 3 serious obstacle to0 radical reorganisation.3,    With the authority and approval of the Government the T.H.G.nas therefore made arrangements for the purchase of the sharesowned by British Electric Traction Company, in bus  companies inthe B.E.T. Group, for some  &quot;35m. , which represents the T.H.C.estimate of the value of the underlying assets.      The T.H.C. willte offering to buy the other privately owned shares in these companies on a comparable basis.     The T.H.C. has also acquiredin recent months control of two sizeable independent bus com-panies in Yorkshire (the West Riding automobile Co. , and theExecutors of S. Ledgard) , and v/ill be prepared to consider thepurchase of other large privately owned bus companies if the shareholders wish to sell.     The Government will introducenecessary legislation for the extension of the borrowing powers cfthe T.H.C.4.    It is intended to establish a statutory National Bus company to which will be transferred all the T.K.C.  interests in busundertakings in England and Wales including their interests infirms manufacturing buses.     The T.H.C. has in any case to be reorganised since its road haulage interests are being transferredto the National Freight Corporation.      It is therefore more con-venient to establish a body specifically responsible for passenger transport.     Like the T.H.C., the National Bus Company will be runQn commercial lines.      It will continue to operate through locallytased subsidiary companies.      It will be expected to pay Its way,providing out of revenue for the interest on its capital loaned byExchequer and the renewal of its assets.     The financial duty^he N.B.C. will therefore be basically the same as that ofiSenger Transport Executives./The T.H.C.
l  T.H.C. interests in the operation of bus services in ScotlandppL be transferred to a separate Scottish Transport Board as described below.j    The T.H.C. and its successor body the National Bus Companywill use the opportunity created by the full control of the B.E.T.companies to rationalise the provision of services between their various subsidiaries in a way which has not proved practicablegnen the Tilling Group of bus companies was wholly owned by theU.C. while the B.E.T. Group was effectively controlled by aseparate company.     Although there has been progress in somesreas, there is a good deal of scope for economies by reorganis-ation of services and depots.The National Bus Company will have power - as the T.H.C. hod -to acquire voluntarily bus undertakings which fit in with the restof their services;    but small private operators in many areas willcontinue to play a useful part in the provision of servicesparticularly in country areas.      The N.B.C. will co-operate withother bus operators (and indeed with the Railways Board and thelondon Transport Board in respect of their services)  in order toensure the provision of the necessary public transport services forthe community in as efficient a way as possible.The National Bus Company will have a specific duty to co-operatesith each Passenger Transport Executive, when set up, in carryingtrough the necessary reorganisation of public transport in the5reas concerned.     As described above the subsidiary companies ofthe N.B.C. in each area will make agreements with the Passengerlransport Execut ive;    these agreements will provide for fully^tegrated operation in and near the area over which the ExecutiveVe a responsibility for planning public transport.Such agreements should not of course merely freeze the existingPattern for the provision of services.      Changes will need to be particularly in the great urban areas where the first Passenger/Transport
kgflsport Authorities and Executives will be set up.     some services at present provided by companies which will belong to theNational Bus Company may be more conveniently provided in future byins undertakings owned by an Executive.     Or the reverse may be theg,se.    What is important is that the agreement between theExecutive and the N.B.C. companies should not destroy the basis onwhich the N.B.C. companies can operate profitably.     The N.B.C.companies will be maintaining a wide range of country servicesoutside the main towns on which the level of profits is inevitablylow;  and they will need a proportion of more profitable urbanservices if the &apos; mix&apos; of their services is to lead to a financialviability.     If these companies were deprived entirely of their right to provide urban services, then the people living in countrytowns and villages served by the N.B.C. companies would find them-selves either deprived of services altogether or expected to payfares raised to wholly unreasonable levels.      These considerationssill need to be taken into account in the arrangements made betweenExecutives and the N.B.C.Where they are operating services for passengers wholly withina Passenger Transport Area the N.B.C. companies will operate underthe terras of their agreement with the Executive and not as at present under the jurisdiction of the Traffic Commissioners.     The nature ofthe services to be provided and the level of fares to be chargedmil therefore . depend on the terms of the agreement and will have toe related to the general fares policy laid down by the Authority to&apos;0&apos; followed by the Executive for its area.The agreements must however be such as will enable the N.B.C.iPahies to fulfil their financial responsibilities.     The N.B.C.*panies cannot, however, be expected to enter into agreements^ich would entail their operating at a loss, and so form a back-)r method of gaining Government money to subsidise the operation0^ocal transport services.      If under their policy the Passenger/to be
t0 be held down, or certain highly unprofitable services to becontinued, then the policy must be applied to N.B.C. companies operating in the Area as well as the Executive&apos;s own undertakings.11   The establishment of the National Bus Company provides anopportunity to clear up some anachronisms in the nationalisedtransport field.     The Railways Board have retained certain jointinterests with the local authorities in bus undertakings operatingto Halifax, Huddersf ie Id, Sheffield and Todmorden.     These interestswuW be more sensibly vested in the National Bus Company and thissill be done..2, More important, British Railways also have the responsibilityfor securing the provision of bus services required to be provided as a condition of the consent of the Minister of Transport to theiithdravvsl of rail passenger services.     This responsibility incany cases involves the Railways Board in the negotiation of con-tinuing contracts with bus operators which involved the payment bythe Board of subsidies to those bus operators of more than  500,000in 1966.    When the acquisition of BET undertakings by the THC is complete, over three-quarters of these subsidies will be pcyable to companies which will be owned by the NBC or STB and which they willrunning as part of their general network of services.3&apos; The negotiation of contracts for bus services is not an activitywioh is proper to the functions of the Railways Board.      It istherefore intended to transfer to the NBC or STB the obligation tolp,nge for these bus services where these are provided as an-ssential condition to the Minister&apos;s consent for closure of pas-.e&amp;ger rail services.     The exact services provided will naturally6 subject to such amendments and variations as Ministers may from to time decide and the Traffic Commissioners approve./U.in
j4   The estimated cost of the provision of these services hasbeen taken into account in settling the financial duties of thegC and. STB.     The Company and the Board will not necessarilyprovide the services themselves or through a subsidiary company ifthey find it more economical to contract with another operator forthe provision of a particular service.      The N.B.C. and S.T.B. willalso take over from the Railways Board the responsibility for the contracts with private operators in respect of existing railreplacement services and will in future negotiate the renewal ofsuch contracts themselves unless for good reasons any individualoperator is not prepared to have his contract with the railways board transferred to the N.B.C.  or S.T.B.15. The rational Bus Company is being established to make easierthe reorganisation of bus services to meet the needs of each area.It will not he a centralised board but in effect a holding company for a large number of local subsidiaries which will be responsive to local conditions and problems and will cooperate closely withthe communities they serve.     Although it will act commercially its financial responsibilities will not be such as to inhibit it from taking a broad view of proposals for reorganisation whether in a-passenger Transport Area or with a municipal bus undertaking out-S1(te&apos;    In short the establishment of the Company will provide aS8und oasis for developing on a rational basis the provision of services throughout England and Wales.

The pattern of services mustbe flexible enough to respond to movements in population,the development of industry and of tourism, increased carownership, and the different needs of the Central Belt andof the sparsely populated areas.    In addition to rail andbus services, shipping and air services provide essentialcomponents of the Scottish transport system, especially inthe Highlands and Islands.EXISTING- fplTTBfuh2.     fassenger transport in Scotland is to a large extentalready in public ownership, although through a number ofdifferent agencies.    Apart from the municipal services inthe four cities, the main bus services are provided by theScottish Bus Group, which is a subsidiary of the TransportHolding Company.    The Holding Company also&apos; shares in the ownership of David AacBrayne limited, whose shipping and road services in the West Highlands are assisted by the Secretaryof State for Scotland.    Certain shipping services in Orkneyand Shetland, as well as the new air service to the NorthIsles of Orkney are assisted in the same way.    shipping services in the Clyde are provided by the Caledonian SteamPacket Company, a subsidiary of the British Railways Board.j^^O sep ORGAITIJ ATI on.     The Government consider that the overall planningobjectives for Scotland will be achieved more effectively,especially in the field of transport investment, if thewhole of the road and sea passenger network in public owner-ship is developed by a single organisation responsible to the/Secretary

Initially this organisation will take over the Scottish Bus Group, theTransport Holding Company&apos;s shares in LiacBrayne&apos; s, theCaledonian Steam Packet Company, and the ships at presentchartered to the subsidised shipping companies by theSecretary of State.   The Government hope that the current discussions about a possible lease of the glasgow corporation&apos;s transport undertaking to the Scottish BusGroup will soon be successfully concluded.    The Board willalso have power to acquire by agreement any other under-takings needed to provide an effective passenger transport system; and to provide ancillary facilities such as hotel.;,car parks and piers.HMCIAL ARRANGBIISRTS4.     The Board will operate mainly as a holding company,the various bus and shipping companies being operated assubsidiaries with the fullest possible measure of commercialfreedom.    It will have an obligation to balance its accounts,to the same extent as the national Bus Company (see section V) .&apos;   Essential shipping services will where necessary continue to receive assistance under the highlands and Islands Shipping Services Act, I960, which it isproposed to extend to cover the Caledonian Steam PacketCompany services in the Clyde.

The 3TB will take over responsibility for any bus service required as a result ofa condition of consent to a rail closure, for the samereasons as are described in section V.    Cervices other thanbus services provided by the Board and its subsidiaries aillbe subject to consideration by the Transport Users consultative committee for Scotland, which will be able to make recomaenda-tions to the Secretary of State on the same basis as to theMinister of Transport in respect of the services of other nationalised transport undertakings.OTPTR SERVICES60     The services of the railways and British &quot;uropeanhirways will not be directly affected by these proposals.In view of the functional relationship between the Stranraer-Larne service and other cross-channel services to Ireland,the balance of advantage lies in the operation of this service continuing with the railways.    The future ofhacBraync&apos; s road haulage- services will be a matter for subsequent discussion between the Scottish Transport Boardand the National Preight Corporation.Gpj-C^INh^ON7o     The ocottish Transport Board and the National bus company will be expected to co-operate in matters of common concern, such as research and procurement policy.

TheTransport Bill will empower the Secretary of State to set upPassenger Transport Authorities and Executives in Scotland,but a decision will be deferred for the time being on whether this power should be exercised   and, if so, in what areas.

vTTJjg; A. CLaL ASSISTANCE FOR PUBLIC PTSSIEGLR transport,   Public transport &quot;both in our cities and in the countryside cannot be expected to play its necessary rolewithout new measlres of financial support.    The governmentstated in the 1966 White Paper on Transport Policy that itintended to take powers to provide financial help for public transport.    Proposals have now been worked out in detail, rantstowards Capital hxnenditure in^Pub^2.   The Government will take powers in the Transport Bill tomake grants towards the cost of fixed capital investment in public transport - just as grants are at present giventowards the cost of major highway construction and improvement.This major new development in Government policy is intendedto correct the present imbalance in Governmental financial support for transport in urban areas, where improvements tothe primary road system attract Government grants butexpenditure on public transport facilities does not.3.   The grants will be made towards the cost of approvedprojects&apos;for the provision, improvement or development&apos;of public transport in cities and towns *    Eligible projectswill include:-(a) major improvement    or extension of railway.;,  lines -track,  stations,  signalling systems, re-equipmentwith stock special to the project and associatedinvestment for local railway services;(b) provision of new &quot;fixed track:! rail and bussystems (e.g. tubes or underground railways,monorails, busways);(c) construction or major improvement of;(i)   bus stations and depots,(ii)    terminals and vessels for local passengerferry services,(iii)    interchanges, including car parks, for people transferring to and from publict ran sp o rt systems./The
The costs of preliminary work and the preparation of proposed pro ects will be eligible for grant.Ij,   In 1&apos;england the Minister responsible for making grantswill be the Minister of Transport, and in Scotland and kalesthe Secretary of State.    The rate of grant will be 75/-of the approved cost of major projects seen as tnosedescribed in (a) and (b) above (i.e. the same rate as for grants for major road investment).5,   In deciding whether a project shall be approved for grant the Minister concerned will expect it to be set inthe context of local policies and plans for handling thetransport needs and problems of the area.    Grant will notbe approved for isolated projects which cannot be clearlyrelated to general planning.    Investment in public transportprojects - particularly fixed track systems - is long termin its nature,  and the investment once made is irreversiblefor several decades.    These projects must therefore fit in with plans for the structure of the area,  the land usepattern, the road and rail network, the balance between public and private transport - in short with the basicplanning of the locality.    The land use/transportationstudies in the conurbations will provide a basis forassessing major projects.6,,   The financial return on the investment will clearly be one of the considerations in deciding whether a project should attract grant.    But in evaluating it the minister will also take into account the total benefits which would accrue to the community including any reduction in congestioncosts the value of savings in journey time, not only for those using the new or improved services but of alltravellers in the area,  and all other factors taken intoaccount in social cost/benefit analysis.    Investment in/local
local public transport map well be highly advantageous inthese terms even if the extra reven .e attributable tothe improved services would not cover their full cost(including the high capital charges often involved).7.   The new grants will be of particular value in helping to finance the coat of new; railways and tubes in Londonand the main conurbations, where complete reliance on busesfor public transport is not a practical approach.    the grants will also be of value for fixed track systems (includingspecial roads for buses) in Pew Towns if they are ;judgedthe right solution.    In other free-stauding towns busesusing the ordinary highway will continue for the foreseeable future to provide the great bulk of public transport with only a limited contribution from localrailway lines-.    But even here,  as with the railways, thegrant system will help with providing interchanges and improving terminals so as to make public transport more attractive - and more efficient.    In these cases too the projects must be shown to fit in with the transport planning of the area.8.   application for grant will normally be made by the bodyresponsi. le for the project.    This may be a national body- the Railways Board, the London Transport Board, theNational Bus Conrpany, the Scottish Transport Board - or alocal body - a fassenger Transport executive or localauthorities for bus stations or interchanges.    In a passenger transport ^rea the hinister will expect a project to besubmitted, by or through the Pxecutive so that it can be related to the overall planning of public transport in thearea. And, whether in a Passenger Transport Area or not, the project will have to be properly related to the generaltransport planning of the area and will have therefore tobe the subject of full consultation with the local planning authorities.    There will.also be provision to/empower
empower local authorities to contribute to the capital costof projects of benefit to their area.9,     The contribution by the Government to public transportunder this scheme will be substantial and is likely to  nowsteadily through the ne..t decade.    The first projects forconsideration will be in London, where the Government hasalready agreed to the Brixton extension of the Victoria line and will be considering the project for grant under thescheme.    But soon projects are likely to be coming forwaidfrom the .&apos;;:ain conurbations.   The Panchester Rapid Transitdtudy, commissioned by the fillister and the manchester corporation last year, has been published, and thisdescribes    the kind of public transport developments whichmay be needed in a typical conurbation.   The next stage willbe to proceed with the detailed planning of an undergroundrailway providing direct rail access to the heart ofhanchester.   This and. other rail developments will be assessed in the 3LLNLC Transportation Study which is nowbeing undertaken by a joint Ministry and local authorityteam.   Similarly on kerseyside preparatory work is going ahead on the proposed fcersey Railway extension under centralLiverpool, and this proposal too will be assessed in the Lenduse/Transportation Study for that area,h- . BUe GRANTS10.   The capital grants for fixed investment in public transport will not be of major importance to bus operation.Yet in all areas outside central London the bus is likely tocontinue to provide the bulk of short distance public transport services and in many areas it will be the onlyavailable form of public transport.   .Any moves to help and improve public transport must therefore include a radicaleffort to increase the attractiveness of bus services by/comparison
comparison with the private car, and to increase as faras possible the economy and efficiency of the operation of bus services.11.   It is clear that these aims can be achieved only by aconsiderable increase in expenditure on the re-equipment of existing bus fleets with new vehicles.    The cost of this -equipment programme can be so large that individualoperators need financial incentives to encourage them to embark on it.    The rapid extension of &quot;one-man operation&apos;of buses is essential to hold down costs of operation in the face of rising labour costs and    the fall in passengers.If &apos;one-man operation&apos;  is to be introduced as quickly as itshould be, this will require the replacement - earlier thancustomary - of existing buses not suitable for suchoperation..    Mid the additional capital charges can swallowup a large part of the savings in the early years.    In the cities the installation of fully automatic equipment for farcollection would greatly facilitate one-man bus operation.This too would involve substantial additional capitalexpenditure.12.   Apart from this, developments in bus services may wellrequire an increase in the use of specialised types of busesfor specific purposes - limited-stop commuter services,feeder services to stations, standee buses, small buses fortown centre use.    This again may well justify replacement ofexisting buses before the normal date.13.   Moreover if buses are to compete more effectively withthe private car passengers must be offered higher standards of comfort:  quality of ride, warmth, air-conditioning,convenience of boarding and so forth,    And bus drivers inthe future will need additional facilities, such as fullyautomatic transmission, for helping their work, particularly/when
when they are operating with a conductor0   All this .will raise the cost oP the individual bus0lli.   The G-overnment proposes therefore to take powers tointroduce a grant scheme for the purchase of new buses.The rate of grant will be 2o,a of the approved cost.15.   These new bus grants will be made only for buses of types approved by the minister of Transport, appropriate for use on ordinary stage services.    (They will not applyto luxury coaches and long-distance express buses).16.   The aim of the new scheme is to encourage the purchaseof standardised buses of high quality.    It is a majorweakness in the manufacture of buses for the British marketthat each operator tends to produce his own detailedspecification varying not basically but in many details fromthe buses ordered by other operators.   This makes largeproduction runs impossible and so increases costs.    Basicspecifications for a limited range of models will be laiddown in consultation with manufacturers and, operators, and only vehicles conforming to these specifications will normally be eligible for.grant. Grant will also be payable forexperimental vehicles in approved cases, so as to stimulatenew development.17.   The Minister may lay down certain conditions (apartfrom compliance with the safety conditions of theConstruction and Use Regulations and international standardrecommendations) for buses to be eligible for grant.Discussions will be opened immediately with bus manufacturers and operators on the conditions of eligibility for grant.13.   The scheme will apply to buses delivered to operatorsfrom 1st October, i960.    As soon as the conditions ofeligibility have been settled, the Minister will be preparedto consider grant applications for buses for which orders have already been or will be placed for delivery after that/ date.
date,   nil bus operators - Passenger Transport Executives,municipal bus undertakings, the nationalised sector, and private operators - will be eligible for the grants.Operators will normally have to make a refund of grant ifthey sell the bus, or cease to use it on stage services,within five years of its delivery new.19.   The Scheme will be introduced for a period of seven years.   It may be extended beyond this period if the needstill exists to encourage faster replacement.20.   Expenditure on new buses primarily for stage services is at present running at something like .320m. a year.    Thisis based on an average life of about 15 years.    If replace-ment is speeded up the total expenditure will increase.The economies of standardisation should offset some increasein the costs due to higher standards.   The Government&apos;sassistance to the bus industry through these grants islikely to be at least .55 million and probably more a year -a substantial contribution towards the capital costs.BU3 FUEL OR/JSTS21.   Representations have been made repeatedly by busoperators that fuel duty represents a heavy burden on bus services which ought to be removed.    Stage bus services have of course been insulated from recent increases in fuel dutyby the payment of an offsetting grant by the Minister ofTransport now totalling lOd. a gallon.   The Government hascarefully considered the representations of bus operators;but has concluded that it would be wrong to exempt stagebus services entirely from taxation on the fuel they use.Bus operators have access to a track which has been  provided at the public expense and for which they make no directpayment.    In economic terms it is right that bus operatorsshould meet a charge broadly equivalent to the cost ofproviding the track facilities which they use.
22.   The Government does not consider it desirable in thelight of&quot; their policy of assisting public transport to seen to raise fuel taxation on stage bus services in excess ofthis,   horeover the weight of fuel duty has had an unfortunatside-effect on the design of buses.    Operators have sought to keep fuel consumption as low as possible and this hasled to the use of power/weight ratios for most busesconsiderably lower than that for many buses used in other-countries -    In present traffic conditions buses need betterpowers of acceleration, automatic transmission, powersteering and other characteristics which tend to increasefuel consumption.23.   The Government has therefore decided to increase thegrant paid to operators of stage bus services by a further9do a gallon bringing the total to Is. 7d. a gallon.   Theadditional payment will be made in respect of fuel used on and after 1st April, 19&amp;B - subject to the passage of thenecessary legislation.    The Government would not ho a eve .consider it reasonable for the industry to press for afurther reduction below this level.    The additional grantwill be worth1 some .37 million a year to the industry./Subsidies
RES rRIC Edi ii tt)SUBS IDLES T0 7ARDS OPERATING COSTS24,   The capital grants for fixed assets and for buses, andthe further grant to offset fuel duty, represent a largeGovernment contribution to help public transport.     Theywill be available to public transport operators throughout thecountry within the terms already described.      It is unclesir-&apos;able as a general principle for the central Government toprovide grants or subsidies out of national taxation to meetlosses incurred in the operation of local urban services,except in the special circumstances set out below.25.   The reason for this is that whether a local public transport system operates at a loss or a profit will dependbasically on local factors.     Some - such as the efficiency of the management of the undertaking - will be within thecontrol of the operator.     Others - such as the traffic conditions under which buses are within the control of thelocal authorities.     Much will depend on the extent towhich the local community demands - and is prepared to face the cost of maintaining - off-peak and Sunday services whichare very lightly loaded.      It follows that any subsidies whichare to be given to meet operating losses of public transportoperators ought to be provided by local communities.     Thisis why Passenger Transport Authorities are being given power&quot;to precept on the rates of local authorities.Suburban Rail Services in Passenger Transport Areas26,   However, as explained in section IV above the passenger transport Authorities and Executives in areas where rail-ways are particularly important for local passenger move-ment (notably the main conurbations) will be required to   i assume responsibility for deciding the services which shouldtoe provided by British Railways in the context of the/comprehens ive
comprehensive transport plan for the area.27.   The present suburban rail services in the mainconurbations outside London are losing in total severalmillion pounds a year.     These losses are at present met bythe taxpayer through the British Railways deficit.      Itwould obviously be impossible - and quite wrong - to expect the Passenger Transport Authorities, and through them thelocal communities, suddenly to take over responsibility forfinding sums of this magnitude.     Moreover, the passenger transport Authorities will, at the very beginning, have little choice but to continue the existing pattern of services.28.   But in the course of time the Passenger transport authorities and Executives will be taking many decisions which will fundamentally affect the cost of providing these services.      As part of the integration of bus and railservices they will decide to expand some rail services,create new ones - and perhaps to curtail others.     Thelevel of suburban rail fares will be settled by theAuthorities as part of their general policy on fares.      Somerail services which are at present not paying their way may become profitable if bus services are organised so as to makeit more convenient to use rail.      In the long run, therefore,&quot;the size of any losses on suburban rail services in the conurbations will be determined by local decision.      it follows that the cost should ultimately be borne on thegeneral accounts of the Executives.29.   But help will be needed at first.     Therefore theGovernment proposes to make grants to Executives in respectof the costs of rail services covered by the agreement.In the first year of the Executives&apos; agreements with the/Railways
Railways Board the grant will he 90% of the estimated cost.The level of grant will he tapered over a period of years inthe light of progress with the Authority&apos;s integratedtransport plan and of the money level of other forms ofGovernment help to public transport.Rural Bus Services30.   The second area in which Government assistance will begiven towards the cost of operating particular local services is the scheme for rural bus grants.      This scheme is intendedto do something effective to implement the Report of the JackCommittee of 1961.     The Government proposes to give powers tolooa.1 authorities to make grants to operators of bus services in rural areas where the essential services could not beprovided on a commercial basis.     Provided that the termslaid down by the Minister or the Secretary of State concerned are complied with, the appropriate Department will make a payment to local authorities of 50% of the grant paid to thebus operator.      This scheme is designed to deal with thesituation in remote country areas which can no longer sustaina bus service on a commercial basis simply because the numberof people who need or want to use  it is so small.      In theGovernment1 s view it would be wrong for areas like these tobe deprived almost entirely of access to public transporteven though the number of people who would be seriously affected may be relatively small.      For general socialreasons, it is right that the Central Government should contribute, towards the cost of maintaining some bus services in these outlying areas.31. The National Bus Company and the Scottish transport board will continue to maintain many services in country/ areas
areas which do not cover their full cost of operation.     Butthere are others where the receipts may be so low that neitherthe National Bus Company, the Scottish Transport Board norprivate operators can be expected to maintain them without some form of grant or subsidy.32.   But it is for the local community to decide whether aparticular service is so important to the needs of the areathat it is worth providing a continuing subsidy to keep itgoing.     Applications from operators will therefore have to bemade to the local authorities concerned who wall have to reach a decision.      If the cost of subsidising the service is small(less than  500 a year) the Minister concerned will give thelocal authority 50$ of the cost of subsidy without prior approval.      In other cases a specific application by the localauthority for grant will be considered on its merits.     Thegeneral criteria to be followed will be worked out inconsultation with the local authorities.33.   Local authorities will be given powers, to make grants notonly towards operating costs, but also for other suitablepurposes, such as buying vehicles.     The whole system shouldhe flexible and as simple as possible.     At the same time, Itwill be necessary to make sure that grants are not given for services for which the demand is so limited that the benefitsderived from the expenditure are too small.      And it will benecessary to review services after a period to see whether theyare worth-while.      In many cases these services to outlyingvillages can best be provided by private operators who may wellrun a bus service in conjunction with other activities.     Theservice may well be best provided with a relatively smallvehicle.     The Government itself is experimenting with the use/of minibuses
of minibuses on some postal services which will at .the sametime carry a few passengers.      It is also proposed to simplify the procedure for obtaining a licence to run bus services with small vehicles so that these operators will find it easier toundertake the job.34.    It is expected that the cost of the Rural Bus grants scheme will build up slowly;    much will depend on the viewstaken by individual local authorities as to the scale on whichthese country services should be maintained.      It is not expected however that the eventual cost will rise beyond about 4m. a year, in which event the Exchequer would be contribution-ing  2m. of this.     The Exchequer contribution will be a specific grant.Ferry Services35.   Arrangements similar to those in respect of bus services will be made to assist ferry services which benefit people living in rural areas.     The principle of grant-aiding such services has already been accepted in legislation affecting theScottish Highlands and Islands (whose special position is dealtwith in section VI).     Local authorities will be empowered togive grants towards capital or operating costs and may receive a contribution from the Exchequer.     As the circumstances ofthe ferry services concerned vary more widely than those of bus services no fixed percentage for the Government&apos;contribution will be laid down.     In other respects theadministrative arrangements will be the same as for the RuralBus Grants Scheme.Conclusions36.   The schemes described above represent a new and large scale programme of Government assistance to local passenger/transport
transport services.     They may well amount to at least  20m.in the first year, rising thereafter as the preparation of approved major capital projects goes forward, over and aboveanything which is now being contributed.     They should providea powerful incentive to develop and re-equip public transport and to increase its operating efficiency.
VIII. TRAVEL CONCESSIONS1    In 1964- one of the first acts of the new Government was toitfree local authorities from the restrictions which had beenloosed on their freedom to give travel concessions to old-people, the blind and disabled, and children on their own busundertakings.     Many took: advantage of this.      But the effectdas teen to produce many anomalies since local authorities arestill unable to arrange for such concessions on non-municipalbuses operating in their areas.     This means that many localauthorities cannot provide their residents with any concessions.The transfer of many municipal undertakings to the passenger transport Executives requires a new approach to this question.After full consultation with all those concerned, the Governmenthas decided that local authorities should, have powers to arrangenith the Executives for concessions to be provided on their services in the Passenger Transport Areas ;    and also to makesimilar arrangements for concessions on local journeys with busoperators outside these Areas.     These powers for localauthorities will apply to concessions for old people, the disabled, and the blind, but not concessions for children sincethe level of cheap fares for children is customarily providedfor by operators who will be controlled in this matter by the traffic Commissioners or the Passenger Transport Authorities.3-   If they arrange such concessions the local authority willexpected to meet the cost to the operator of giving them.(Pie Minister will lay down a basis on which the cost should be calculated;    and provision will be made for settling any disputeabout the cost in a particular case, normally by the Chairman oftraffic Commissioners.^   The cost of concessions given by local authorities on their^1 bus undertakings, even if it is met from the rates, does not count in calculating the total amount of the rate support grantJjthe Government to local authorities.      In removing the present/anomalies
lollies the Government will also wish to avoid any distinction between the cost of the concession on municipal&apos;: undertakings and on other bus undertakings.     The cost to localauthorities of all concessions under the travel concessionsDivisions will therefore not be taken into account in calculating the aggregate of rote support grant.5,   The Passenger Transport Executives will, with the consent oftheir Authorities, be free also to introduce concessionary faresthemselves on any of the services operated in their area.      Itsill he for the Authority to decide whether or not the cost ofgiving such concessions throughout the Passenger Transport area should fall on the general accounts of the Executive or should beret by a rate precept.      In the long run Passenger transport authorities may well wish to see a common pattern of concessionsacross the whole of their area; and this possibly will be an advantage of inclusion in a Passenger Transport Area.     Butthe Authorities will inherit a very mixed selection of concessions, some wholly free and some at reduced rates.      Itsay therefore be right in the first place for them to make arrangements with individual local authorities pending theisvelopment of the consistent policy.5-   The position in London is being dealt with separately sincem new arrangements for Passenger Transport Authorities do nota??ly in London.restricted:
IX. BUS DRIVERS HOURS\ ,     The Government has in the past year been discussing withthe public transport operators and the representatives of thebus workers concerned the application to the road passenger transport industry of the review of legislation controlling the legal limit on the working hours of professional drivers.This legislation has remained unaltered since the 1930s.2.     Major changes in the present legislation on drivers&apos;hours both for lorry drivers and for bus drivers will beincluded in the Transport Bill.   The main provisions will be thesame for both but there will be a number of variationsdesigned to meet the specific operating conditions of the passenger transport business.3.     The main provisions in relation to bus drivers will be-as follows:-(i) The maximum length of the working day will bereduced from 1k hours to 11 hours;    but in order toenable- the bus industry to meet the needs of passengersat the morning and evening rush hours there will be aspecial provision for stage services that the 11 hourswork may be spread over a period of not more than 1 2-g-hours in total.   Appropriate spreadover provision willalso be made to meet the special circumstances ofexpress and excursion work.   Not more than 9 hours ofthe time in any working day may be spent actually drivingthe vehicle.(ii) Before starting a cay&apos;s work the bus driverwill normally have to have a period of 11  hours restrather than 10 as at present.    (Though on one day aweek the period can be  reduced to 9i hours rather thanthe 8 hours at present.)
(iii) Not more than 60 hours of work may he done ina week and the driver will have to have at least onefull root day of 24 hours off duty each week.(iv) These requirements will be applied to the driversof large passenger -vehicles whether or not they arelicensed as buses.4.     Many bus and coach drivers are working hourssubstantially in excess of these limits.    In particular, thepractice of working on the rest day in a 6-day week or evenon both rest-days in a 5-day week is widespread because ofthe shortage of bus drivers.    It is clear that to bring thehours worked in the bus industry into conformity with thenew rules is likely to require either a very largo number ofadditional bus ^drivers or a very considerable improvementin the effective work carried out by the existing drivers.Otherwise bus operators will be forced to make substantial reductions in bus services including cuts in peak hourservices.5.   The Government naturally has no desire to introduce changes which will result in serious inconvenience if not actualhardship -to the travelling public.    On the other hand theexisting hours of work are unreasonably long in relation tovehicles carrying largo numbers of members of the public.The Government considers that it is necessary to achieve in thebus industry conformity with the new rules at the earliestpossible date.    However in determining when it is possiblefor the new rules to be introduced the Government will haveto have full regard to the ability of the bus industry toprovide adequate services for the travelling public.Discussions arc-continuing with both the bus operators and representatives of the bus workers on how best to overcome the problems.. &apos; ,/X.  PLANNING POP TRAFFIC
X   PLAiTPING gQRjrgAjglC.1,    The first part of this   .&apos;hite Paper emphasised, that land use and transport in our towns must be planned together as partof an integrated whole, and that an urban transport plan is needed in every major town or city.    To do this effectively thepov/ers of local authorities in relation to traffic matters mustbe improved to make them as flexible and effective as possible and the central Government must play a more positive role.2,    The proper role of the Government is not the detailedsupervision of the actions of local authorities which is carriedout today.    The responsibility for deciding how to handle the impact of traffic on the effective working and character oftheir area must be with local authorities.    It is the role ofthe Minister of Transport (in partnership with the Minister of housing and Local Government) and the Secretaries of State forScotland, and   ales, to remove obstacles to comprehensive andimaginative action by local authorities, to create the rightlegislative and financial framework, and to assist In experimentsand in the dissemination of results.    This is the basis of thepolicy described below&apos;, which includes:-(a) the preparation of Urban Transport Plans by localauthorities for submission to the Minister concerned;(b) the extension of highway capital grants to certain types of expenditure on traffic management;(c) widening the powers of local authorities in respectof the management of traffic and the control ofparking;(d) making local authorities responsible for the traffic management and parking arrangements in their areas,and eliminating the need for Ministerial approval oflarge numbers of traffic regulation orders made by them;(e) simplifying the procedure for the making of orders./Urban
pphflr^Transport Planst),    The Minister of Transport will shortly &quot;be asking localauthorities in English County Boroughs and other local authoritiesin towns of over 50,000 population outside Greater London toprepare as soon as possible, (and certainly by the first halfof 19^9) plans setting out how they propose to handle thetransport problems in their areas between now and the mid 1970&apos;s;similar requests will be made by the Secretaries of State inScotland and Wales.   These plans must deal with a situation inwhich the amount of traffic seeking to enter and circulate withinlathe town will inevitably grow faster than the capacity of theroad system.   Unless effective action is taken there will be growing congestion, town centres will become less easilya a &apos; : . ;accessible and. their value as focal points for the life of thecommunity will be seriously damaged,    dconomic losses arisingfrom congestion will mount.   Road safety will be impaired.   the pressure of moving and parked vehicles will increasingly damage the environment.    Positive policies and strong local action willbe needed to avert the harmful consequences that will otherwiseaccompany the benefits of growing car ownership.k*    The plan will have to seek deliberately to strike the rightbalance in each area of the town between the claims of movingtraffic, of accessibility to places in the area, of road safety and of the environment,    it will have to take accountboth of the needs of people in the area and the necessity toprovide for efficient movement of goods.    It must hold the scalebetween the needs of people on foot and those using vehicles.   Atetter balance between the use of public transport and privateicars,is, itself, a means of easing traffic congestion.    ThePlan must therefore be concerned with the interests of busPassengers at least as much as those who choose to use theirp.0-&apos;n cars.
5,    The plan will eventually need to be geared to the long-term Structure Plan for the area which in England and  /ales willbe prepared under the new legislation on town and country planning to be introduced by the Minister of Housing and Local Government;similar legislation for Scotland will be brought forward in due course.    But it will have to deal with the problem of planning for traffic over the next few years, before many of the new structure Plans will be ready and before major re-developmentcan in most cases be carried out.6,    The plan will be submitted to the Minister of Transport orthe Secretary of State,    It is not intended that it should be a formal statutory document since this would only delay preparation and inhibit change;    in any case ample safeguards surroundthe making of the individual traffic regulation orders needed toput it into effect.    The plans will be statements of policy andguide lines for action which must be kept continuously underreview as circumstances change.    The Departments concerned willoffer comments upon them and will seek to help with guidance.The nature of these plans will also have a considerable bearing on the attitude of the minister of Transport or Secretary ofState to applications for capital grants towards the cost ofhighway improvements and transport facilities.Il^tjjp^for jtoaf&apos;fJ-c management7.    Under the present system of grants for improvements toprincipal roads traffic engineering installations which cangreatly improve traffic conditions are often ineligible for specific grant aid.    The system will therefore be altered soas to give local authorities specific financial help towardsintroducing comprehensive traffic management schemes.    Detailsof this proposal are being discussed with the local authority associations./widening
jfadgrnng.. the concept of traffic regulationTiie powers of local authorities to regulate traffic under the3oad Traffic Regulation Act, 1967 (which merely consolidatedgaIqier legislation) are too narrowly conceived.    They wouldnot enable satisfactory urban transport plans to be carried throughejn the first place they are very largely concerned with promotingtraffic movement and only in a very limited and ineffectual wayto the whole problem of the urban environment and the needs of the the people Who live and work in the town.9,   The Transport Bill will therefore provide specifically thatthe various measures of traffic regulation open to localauthorities can be adopted for the purpose of preserving orimproving the amenities of an area as well as for other purposes.At the same time the Bill will place a specific duty on localauthorities to use their traffic regulation powers with full regard to the effect on the amenities of any locality which wouldbe affected.   Accessibility is,  of course one of the amenities of an area, and the proper needs of the community in terms of free movement in a town and access to its facilities will need to-be given full we ight.10.  Secondly,  the existing legislation does not have sufficientconcern for people on foot in towns.    It is therefore proposed toextend the powers of local authorities to regulate traffic inorder to facilitate the movement of people on foot as well asvehicles;    and. to place on them a duty to use their powers inorder to secure convenient and safe movement of pedestrians asf&apos;ell as wheeled traffic.   Equally pedestrians who are thoughtless% endanger the lives of others as well as their own.    The powers0f local authorities will be extended so that they will be ableyhere necessary to control the use of roads by pedestrians asr&apos;ell as vehicles, for example by prohibiting them from usingroads, bridges and tunnels designed solely for wheeled traffic.A1 *
-II,   Thirdly, the present powers give no recognition to the majorrole which must be played by public transport in solving thetransport and traffic problems in our cities.    A specific dutywill be placed on local authorities in using their traffic powersto have regard to the importance of helping buses to move freely,and to secure the safety and convenience of people using them,so that they can be given the opportunity to provide a more attractive alternative to travel by private car.12.   A thorough-going parking policy is needed to ensure that thevolume of traffic seeking to enter and circulate in the congestedcentral areas of our cities is sensibly related to the capacityof the road system, particularly during peak hours.    It isessential that the optimum amount of parking space should beprovided in the right places and subject to controls on its usethat are appropriate to local circumstances.   The Transport 3111will therefore place on local authorities a general duty tosecure the provision of suitable and adequate parking facilities,on and off street.13*   Local authorities&apos; powers to control parking have so farusually been regarded as a way of reducing the amount ofobstruction caused to moving traffic by vehicles parked on the highway, or to&apos; share out scarce parking space.    Parking controlhas been applied in relatively small areas of particularlysevere congestion.    Over the next few years, parking control will be needed over quite wide areas in all cities and indeed in many small towns.   Control may be exercised in a variety ofv/ays;   it may involve payment or not.    These are matters for local authorities to decide for themselves.    But to achieve the best solution in particular circumstances, local authoritiesneed wider and more flexible powers than they have at present./ih.
\\\.   The Transport Bill will therefore give powers to localauthorities to introduce parking controls with much morediscrimination and flexibility than at present.    In particular they will all have powers similar to those now available in london to set up parking areas where parking \7ould be permitted only tothose to whom a special permit had been issued, and to makecharges for this facility.    This will be particularly helpfulwhere parking control schemes have to include residential ares which because of their nature do not contain adequate garagefacilities for the residents.    Similarly, local authorities willbe given the power to issue certificates or other means of identification for particular vehicles which ought, for special reasons, to be exempted from the provisions of traffic regulationorders and in particular on waiting in particular roads.15*   Local authorities also ought to have more flexibility inthe use of parking meter profits.   At present, these can beused only for the provision of off-street parking.    This is a desirable use as long as the total amount of parking space in acity centre - particularly for all-day parkiflg - is not raised to a level which leads to severe congestion;    for it is in citycentres that meter profits are usually highest, and these arethe very places where there may well be a need to limit off-streetparking space.    In such places it is not sensible to provide additional parking spaces which would attract traffic in excessof the capacity of the road system.   moreover, the effect ofthe present law can be to encourage the use of meter profitsto subsidise off-street parking charges in places wheresubsidy is least justified on transport grounds.    The bill will therefore provide that local authorities may also useParking meter revenues either for the provision of public transport services or for carrying out highway improvements(including traffic engineering) in the area.    It is not however intended to allow them to be used merely to offsetgeneral local authority expenditure.
Greater, responsibility for local authorities is,   The Bill will also provide for a substantial reduction inthe degree of detailed, control exercised by the CentralGovernment over the particular traffic regulation or parkingschemes of local authorities.   At present, a great many schemesrequire the approval of ministers.    In future, the consent ofa Liinister will be needed only in a few specific cases.    Themost important of these will be:-(l)   orders which prevent access by vehicle to premises ina road for more than 8 hours in 2k (though, as in thepresent law, orders prohibiting the loading orunloading of goods at the kerbside would not on that account require Ministerial approval.)    This would apply for example, to a street which was made intoa pedestrian precinct for a large part of the day.(2)   Orders fixing speed limits on principal roads or a speed limit below 30 m.p.h. on any other road.    Inthese cases a Minister would need to ensure that areasonable balance was struck between local safety and vehicle movement.(3)   Orders made by a local authority applying to a trunk road.    Most orders applying to trunk road trafficare made by the appropriate Minister but an areascheme of parking control might include a trunk road;and Ministers would therefore be concerned.The effect of this will be to remove the need for Ministerialapproval of about 1,000 orders a year including ones which:-(a)    prohibit, restrict or regulate the use of a roadby any specified class of traffic (except as inparagraph 16 above);/(b)
&amp;ESTRSC1 iDr(b) prohibit or restrict overtaking;(c) prohibit the use of roads by through traffic;(d) create street playgrounds;(s)   designate street parking places, with or without charges;(f)    create areas of general traffic control without parkingcharges (except as in sub paragraphs 16(1) above).17.   At present Ministerial consent is also required for everyindividual pedestrian crossing.    In the Governments view localauthorities should take this responsibility themselves, except on trunk roads.    It is therefore intended to fix, for each localauthority, a puota for all pedestrian crossings in their areabased on population, which may be exceeded only with specialauthority, and to give general advice upon the types of crossingsavailable, their costs and. usage.     Jlthin the limits of the quotalocal authorities will be free to site crossings where theythink fit.   The object of cpuota control is to avoid a repetition of the situation which had  arisen  by 1951, when thenumber of crossings reached a point at which they became ignoredby drivers.18.   Ministerial approval is now required for the installation of some 17 different types of prescribed traffic sign,  includingtraffic lights.    As soon as possible regulations will be madeto enable local authorities to put up themselves all road signsof approved pattern other than traffic signals, except ontrunk and principal road.s.    The installation and alteration oftraffic lights will continue to require Departmental approval,because of their growing complexity.19.   The need at present to secure Ministerial approval tocertain individual orders is widely regarded as a method of protecting the interests of individual or particular groupsagainst unfair treatment by their local authorities.    The/Government
government considers that discretion to use general reservesowers where necessary is preferable to mandatory detailedcontrol of individual order-making by local authorities.   TheBill will therefore provide not only for powers for ministers to revoke and vary orders made by local authorities but alsopowers to direct them where, in a Minister?s view, there is urgent need for action.Simplification of procedure20.   The Transport Bill will give Ministers power to make regulations governing the procedure for making orders, (e.g. suchmatters as the form of the orders consultation and public noti-fication) including those procedural matters which are at presentfixed by the Road Traffic regulation Act,  1967 itself.   Thepresent procedures are in many instances cumbersome and preventspeedy and effective action.    On the other hand the proceduremust give adequate time and opportunities for all those whoconsider they would be affected by an order to make clear tothe local authority the nature of their objections so that thelocal authority can consider whether changes should be made intheir proposals.21.   A thorough review of the existing procedural requirements is being undertaken by Ministers and the drafting of new regulations to determine procedure will be discussed with localauthorities and other interests during 1968, so that the newprocedural regulations can be brought into effect soon afterthe Transport Bill becomes law.    These procedural regulations will be supported by administrative instructions to guidelocal authorities in the making of traffic regulation orders and to serve as a code of practice on such matters asconsultation with those whose interests might be affected bythe proposals./Traffic
22.   It Is n0 use making traffic orders if they are not going tobe reasonably well observed or, in the last resort, effectivelyenforced.    The Transport Bill will therefore require localauthorities to consult with the Chief Officer of Police beforemalting any traffic regulation order.    This will ensure that thepolice are able to give their views on the effects of the order and on any difficulties of enforcement which may arise from thenature of the order.23.   But of course there are only a limited number of policemenavailable.    It is therefore important that fuller use should bemade of traffic wardens, a recent reinforcement of great value to the police.    To enable this to be done, the Transport bill will seelc an extension of the powers and functions of trafficwardens, on the lines recommended by the Police Advisory board for dngland and  ;ales at the end. of last year.    In performingtheir present functions of enforcing the laws relating to parking,and of regulating road traffic,  traffic wardens are to have thesupport of the same legal sanctions as constables have when theyperform these duties.    They are also to be given new powers to direct traffic, and to require people to give their names andaddresses in certain circumstances.    They are also to be able todeal with certain aspects of vehicle excise law.    But they arenot to have the powers of a constable to arrest people.Greater, London2lu   Many of the powers and duties to be included in the transport bill already apply to the Greater London Council.

XI Rosearch and Devolofffiyent1,    Over recent decades little fundamental research work hasbeen done in Britain on the &quot;problems of improving systems of passenger transport in our cities.   The Ministry ofTransport is now mounting a substantial programme of work tomake good this neglect:.2,    Arrangements have been made by the Minister of transport and the Minister of Technology to combine the resources of-the two Departments in developing a programme of new research ona joint basis;    and a substantial pert of this programme willbe concerned with urban passenger problems.     A full-timeTransport Research Assessment Group has been sot up consistingof a consortium of scientists and engineers from the road research Laboratory,  the Royal Aircraft Establishment,  the atomic Energy Authority and the British Railways Board.    TheNational Development Corporation is also cooperating closely in these arrangements...3.    Within the framework of the general programme individual projects have already been started.    In cooperation with industry work is under way to assess the feasibility, bothtechnical and economic of a novel system of Guided Buses,A more complex project is concerned with the feasibility ofa fully automatic self-routing system of taxi-trains (anetwork of small cars without drivers controlled by a centralcomputer.)    This project is a method of examining thefundamental problems of the use of fully automatic vehiclesnot on a. single track (which will be done in the Victoriatube line in London) but on a general purpose branching network.4.    In addition to the programme undertaken by the Governmentthe National Bus Company will have a specific duty to promoteresearch into problems of road passenger transportoperations;    and the Passenger Transport Executives willhave power to engage in research and development work.    TheMinistry of Transport will seek to assist bus operators to mounta much needed programme of operational research. /5. The
5.     Tho Ministry is also engaged on 0. substantial economicresearch programme much oi which is relevant to passenger transport problems in the cities.    Mathematical models (andassociated computer programmes) arc being developed forforecasting flows of people and goods both within urban areas and for regions as a whole.    The object of-this work is to provide a better basis for investment decisions and forevaluating pricing proposals.    The Ministry has recently taken over the analysis and forecasting work on the South east lancashire - Northeast Cheshire Transportation study,6.     Tho Ministry is also elaborating tho work already doneon tho factors which influence the choices which people make as to whether to use rail, bus, or private car for particularjourneys.    Public transport operators have been much hampered,as have town planners, by the. lack of knowledge as to the significance of speed, reliability, comfort, and cost in determining tho choices which people make.    The Ministry has there fore commissioned studies in several cities which willattempt to secure information on these matters by the useof refined statistical techniques.7.     Tho Ministry is also continuing work on the analysis ofthe costs of operating buses in various conditions.    Inparticular an analysis is being made of the relationship between the labour costs of vehicle operation and the peaksin vehicle use on specific routes.    It is intended tocontinue this kind of work in full cooperation with busoperators including the NBC and the PTE&apos;s.8.     In addition to the fundamental scientific and economicresearch work so far described the Ministry is seeking to cooperate with public transport operators in any projects ofgeneral importance.    Tho Manchester Rapid Transit Study whichwas largely financed by tho Ministry has produced a greatdeal of information on tho economic and environmental factors involved in the choice of a. new urban rapid transit lino./The
The first report of the Working Party sot up to study theproblems involved in the operation of buses withoutconductors has outlined the main fields in which further work is needed;    particularly the lay-out of the vehicles and the design of the equipment for fare collection.    Thesematters will be pursued,9,     Fundamental research into basically now systems of urbantransport will inevitably take many years to produce resultsand may at times appear fanciful;,    but it must be carried out and a load must be given by the Minictry.    In operationalresearch the Ministry would like to see the public transportoperators themselves taking the lead in cooperative ventureswhich the Mini,::try could support.    But throughout the research programme close links must be built between the ministry the operators and the manufacturers of transport equipmentif the results we need are to be obtained - and obtainedspeedily.
ANNEXESTkBLISHMGNT OE PASSENGER Tic v&apos;SPORT AREAS ANDFUNCTIONING OE PASSENGER TRANSPORT AUTHORITIESAND EXECUTIVES1.     This annex sets out the procedure for establishingPassenger Transport Areas and the way in whichAuthorities and Executives will function when theyhave been set up.Designation of the Area2.     There will be many considerations to take intoaccount in fixing a Passenger Transport Area.     before reaching a decision the Minister concerned will seek theviews of the local authorities in and near the area beingconsidered.     The views of operators of stage bus services and of British Railways will also be taken intoaccount.3.     In the first place, the Area selected should be oneover which local transport services need to be plannedas a whole.     Where the Area includes *a major conurba-tion or city,  it should also include the places around it from which there are substantial movements of commutersto work either by bus or by train.     As far as possiblethe boundaries of the Designated Area will be drawn to correspond with existing local authority boundaries.But it may sometimes be necessary to include part only of a county district within the designated area.4.     In deciding on the Area the Minister concerned willhave regard to any recommendations made by the royal commissions on Local Government so as to minimise anyproblems which might be created over Passenger TransportAreas following any re-organisation of local government.In Wales the Secretary of State will have regard to theproposals in the White Paper on Local Government in/Wales
Wales (Cmd. 3340)Constitution of Passenger Transport authority.     The Minister concerned will make an Order design a-ting the Area and providing for the establishment of twobodies - a Passenger Transport Authority and a passenger transport Executive.6.     The Order will set out the constitution of theAuthority.     It will specify the number of members of theAuthority who will be appointed by county boroughs, countycouncils and county districts (in Scotland county and towncouncils) all or part of whose area falls within the designated Area.     In England and Wales one member atleast of the Authority will be appointed by each countyborough, and provision will be made for joint appoint-ments by county councils or county districts where this is appropriate.7.     In addition to the members appointed by the localauthorities in or partly in the Area the Minister con-cerned will appoint a few members not exceeding one-seventh of the total membership.     Since it is the inten-tion to keep down the Authorities to a workable size, thenumber of members to be appointed by the Minister willprobably be two or three out of a total membership of fifteen to twenty-five.      The Authority will appoint itsown chairman with the approval of the Minister.8.     In deciding the number of appointments to be made bythe various local authorities or group of authorities theMinister will take into account the product of a pennyrate of each local authority area and any other relevant factors.9.     Local authorities will be free to appoint anybodywhether he is a member of their cuncil or not.     However,/if the
if the person appointed is a member of the council atthe time of his appointment and subsequently ceases to bea member, he will have to vacate his office as1 a memberof the Authority, although he may be reappointed.Members or employees of Executives and directors (ifthey are also members of the Executive) and staff ofsubsidiaries will not be eligible to be members of an authority.Appointment of Passenger Transport Executive10.    The Executive will be responsible for the actualplanning and provision of local passenger transport services in their area in conformity with decisions on general policy taken by the Authority itself.11.    The first task of the Authority will be to appoint the members of the Executive.     The Executive will be a body corporate consisting of a Director Generalappointed by the Authority and between two and sixother members appointed by the Authority after consulta-tion with the Director General.     Membership of theExecutive will normally be a full time&quot;appointment.Transfer to Executive of local authority undertakings12.    The Minister concerned will provide by Order, assoon as possible after the Executive has been appointed,that the municipal bus undertakings (and any municipallyowned ferries) will be transferred from local authoritiesin the Designated Area to the Executive.     All the assetsused wholly or mainly in connection with the provision ofa municipal transport undertaking will be vested in theExecutive together with all liabilities related to the carrying on of the undertaking.     If there is any disputeabout which assets and liabilities should be transferred,the matter will be settled by arbitration.13.   People employed by the municipal transport under-takings will be transferred to the service of the/Executive
Executive on terms similar to those normal withtransfers arising from local government reorganisa-tion.    Their pension rights and similar rights will&quot;be transferred at the same time, and. there will heprovision for compensation for those who sufferloss of employment or diminution of emoluments.1k.    Through the transfer of the municipal busundertakings, the Executive will immediately acquire a nucleus of professional staff which will enablethem to carry through the responsibilities whichwill immediately fall upon them.A 5.
15&apos;   Preparation of a Policy statement the first task of the -authority and the Executive willbe to prepare a statement of the policies they intend tofollow and of the action they are taking, or propose totake, in discharging their functions.    The statement willset out in particular:(a) the broad division between bus services which theExecutive is operating, or propose to operate,and those which are being operated, or proposed for operation, by the National Bus Company orother operators;(b) the organisation which the Executive intends toadopt for its own undertaking5(c) the nature of the agreements made or proposed withthe National Bus Company or other bus operators;(d) progress over any agreements with the railways board for providing rail services to meet localtravel needs;(e) the financial position and prospects of theExecutive;(f) the machinery established or proposed for negotiation and consultation with staff;(g) the state of preparation of the plan described insection IP;(h) machinery for securing co-ordination between:(i)    the planning and operation of bus services in the area;(ii)    the preparation and execution by theconstituent councils in the area of plans and policies for traffic regulation orparking.
16.   fhe statement will have to he published within a year of the establishment of the authority, or such furthertime as the minister may allow.Transfer of control of bus services tg^J^17.   During the period of preparation of the policystatement the Executive will operate in conformity withthe Road Traffic Acts the municipal bus services whichhave been transferred to it.    It will therefore need toobtain the approval of the Traffic Commissioners for theArea in the same way as any other bus operator to proposed changes in services and fares.   Nor will it in this periodhave special powers in relation to other bus operators.18.   When however the minister has seen the policy statement and is satisfied with the way in which the Authority and theexecutive intend to proceed, the Minister will make an Orderfixing a date after which control of bus services in the passenger Transport Area will be transferred from the traffic Commissioners to the Executive.19.   After that date all bus operators providing &apos;Area bus services&apos; will only be able to operate either under a consentfrom the Executive in respect of each of their services orunder an agreement with the Executive.20.   This requirement will apply to all bus services whichrun wholly within the Passenger Transport Area.    It will apply to services going into the Area from outside only tothe extent that they carry passengers who are both picked up and set down within the Area.    The Executive will not have any power over a service which merely seeks to set downwithin the area passengers picked up outside, or to pick uppassengers inside the Area to take them to places outside.Such services will continue under the jurisdiction of the traffic Commissioners, and will not be &quot;Area bus services&apos;./21.
21.    The position of all operators who are running &apos;Areabus services&apos; at the time of transfer of control to theExecutive will however he fully safeguarded.    TheExecutive will he required to give consent for the operatorto continue to run the service on the same terras andconditions as in his road service licence at the time ofthe transfer of control.    This consent may he later revokedby the Executive after not less than 9 months notice, but,if so, the Executive will have to compensate the operatorfor any loss suffered by the withdrawal of the consent.And the operator will have the right also to require theExecutive to buy his whole road passenger transportbusiness if he regards withdrawal of consent as so serious as to make it unprofitable for him to continue to runbuses at all.22.   It is not however intended that operators should continue for long operating under consents.    It is   envisaged that theExecutive should either terminate the consents and take overthe services itself, or should make a long term agreementwith each operator governing the provision of services inthe Area.    This agreement would be intended to integrate theservices provided by the operator into the general framework of services provided in the Area.    It would include provisions which would properly protect the position of theNational Bus Company or other operators and it could providefor pooling of receipts or expenses.    There should beprovisions in each agreement for matters under dispute to besettled by an independent person - preferably the traffic commissioners.23.   Even more Important, it is contemplated that these agreements will apply not only to Area bus services but tothe general nexus of services provided by the National/Bus
Bus Company or other operators in and near the Area.    It is most undesirable that the Area boundary should become abarrier to the sensible organisation of services inside and outside the Area.    Services crossing the boundary need tobe integrated into the services within the boundary.Restrictions on the picking up and setting down of passengers on buses entering the Area from outside shouldnot be introduced except where these are for the benefitof the passengers themselves.24.   For Area bus services the Traffic Commissioners andthe ministry&apos;s Area Mechanical Engineers will continue to beresponsible for ensuring that the vehicles used by alloperators, including the Executive, comply with theconditions of fitness and for inspecting the buses to ensurethat safety standards are maintained.    The Commissionerswill also continue to be responsible for the enforcement ofthe regulations affecting drivers&apos; hours, licensing ofdrivers and conductors and other matters.25.   The Executive will be entirely free to apply to the traffic Commissioners for road service licences to run busesbeyond their own area.    In deciding on such applications,the Traffic&apos; Commissioners will treat the Executive inexactly the same way as any other operator.26.   The control of bus services within the Area by theExecutive will not extend to excursions and tours but onlyto stage and ordinary express services.    The number ofexcursions and tours provided wholly within an area willnot be very great.    There seems no advantage and considerabledisadvantage in giving the Executive any monopoly or controlover these services.    They will continue to be licensed bythe Traffic Commissioners in exactly the same way as theyare now whether the services are provided by the Executive ora private operator.
27.    There will however be no restriction on theextent to which an Executive or its subsidiariesmay seek licences for excursion and tour work; andthey will bo free to compete fully with otheroperators for their share of this profitablebusiness.Agreements eith the RaiE &apos;ays-Bojaa?d28.    In the main conurb-tions, and in some other areas,the suburban railway services run by the Railways board have a particularly important contribution to make tothe public transport system.    In these places it  is vital that bus and rail services are fully integrated.In such areas, therefore, the Minister concerned willplace a special duty on the Executive to review therailway passenger services provided by the Board in and near the are,a&apos;, and then to enter into an agreement withthe Board under which the Board will provide such rail-way passenger services as the Authority decide arerequired to meet local travel needs.    This agreement will cover all the local services to be provided forthe Area and not merely those which the Board them-selves would not wish to provide on a commercial basis./29.
29.    It is intended that the methods forcalculating the costs of individual rail servicesshall be determined by the Minister of Transport1and that these should be the same as will be usedfor calculating the Minister of Transports ownpayments to British Railways for unrernunerative railservices.    This is important to safeguard both theRailways Board and the Authorities and Executivessince such a large part of the costs of any individualrail service are composed of &quot;indirect&quot; and &quot;joint&quot;costs.    Wherever possible, the precise nature of theagreement between an Executive and the Board will besettled between them, in order to take account of the costs of the service, the estimated revenue, and theeffect of any measures which the Executive may have in mind and which would be likely to effect the viability of the service.    The Minister will havepower to settle any disputes arising in connectionwith the agreement and to give directions accordingly(in the case of agreements for services in Scotlandand Wales after consulting the Secretary of State).It is not the Minister&apos;s intention to put theBoard in a &quot;cost-plus&quot; position in respect of these services.; they must have a realistic inducement torun1the services efficiently and to attract as manypassengers as they can.    But the calculation of costsmust be on a uniform basis in order to ensure thatall the railways&apos; costs are taken into account, andthat they are not left with a loss which they haveto try to recoup from revenue on other services.In particular, these costs will have to include asufficient allowance for the replacement of necessaryassets, interests and a fair allocation of &quot;joint&quot;costs./terms
terms on which the Board will provide services , itwill bo necessary for the Executive and the Board tohave the matters in dispute settled by an independentprocess.    It will therefore be provided that citherparty may refer the matter to the Minister of Transport,who will have power to issue directions with respectto it,    (In Scotland and &quot;/ales the Minister will consult the Secretary of State first).3%     If the Board satisfy the Executive that the full cost of providing the services in the agreement islikely to be in excess of the revenue, it will be nece-ssary for the Executive, with the Authority&apos;s sanction,to make payments to the Board in respect of it.    TheMinister will be taking powers to make grants to an executive towards any payments made by the Executive tothe Railways Board under such an agreement.    The minister will of course only do this if satisfied that the termsof the agreement are reasonable.    It is not intendedhowever to lay down any statutory conditions about thenature of the agreement.    This will bo settledadministratively.Relationship between the Authority and tho Executive32.      The Authority will be responsible for deciding thogeneral policies to bo followed by the Executive.    TheExecutive will bo responsible for actually planning and providing the public transport services   of the Areaeither through its own undertakings or througharrangements with other operators.33, Tho main moans by which the Authority will exercise its control of policy are s-(a) appointing the Director General and the othermembers, of the Executive,(b) controlling the general level of faros and/the amount
the amount of money to bo raised &quot;byprecept from local authorities, both ofthose doing reflected in the Executive&apos;annual budget, which it must approve,(c)      controlling the Executive s capital development.    The Executive will haveto obtain the authority&apos;s approval for major capital investment (which also willrequire the Minister&apos;s approval) for long-term borrowing, and for the disposal ofany part of the undertaking.34.     In addition the Executive will require theAuthority&apos;s approval for a number of other mattersincluding the agreement with British Railways, theconcessionary fares to be granted on services in thearea, the compulsory purchase of land (which will also require the Ministorfs consent), the.promotion ofParliamentary Bills by the Executive, the submission of reports and plans to the Minister and the oppoint-mont of Auditors for the Executive&apos;s accounts.35.     The procedure for approval of the annual budgetwill put the responsibility firmly on the Authorityfor deciding whether or not the Executive should aim to meet its costs, including the costs of agreements with the Railways Board, from its trading income alone(i.o.  from faros and revenue from ancillaryactivities).    The Executive will prepare estimates of income and expenditure for submission to theAuthority before the beginning of each financial year.If the Authority so decide provision can bo made inthe estimates for the Executive to provide services on a scale or at fares which result in an estimatedloss for the year, but the Authority must then issue a precept on the rating authorities in the Area toraise an amount equal to the estimated loss.    ThoExecutive will bo under a statutory duty to earnsufficient income to moot its expenditure, and socannot carry out any policy envisaging a trading lossunless tho Authority agree to provide for tho loss bymeans of a precept.36.     Tho Authority must settle the amount of theprecept before the beginning of tho financial year so asto give the rating authorities enough notice to include/the
the amount in their roto demands.    If during thecourse of the year the Authorities decide that circumstances have so changed that the Executivecannot reasonably ho expected to fulfil the original estimates then the Authority will give a guarantee tothe Executive to raise the sum &quot;by precept issued inthe following financial year; meanwhile to meet thedifference the Executive will raise money bytemporary borrowing.    This procedure will avoid the needfor supplementary precepts and enable local authoritiesto know in advance the total amount they will have topay in ?. particular year.37.     The Authority will in these ways have full control over the policy framework, both financial and operational, within which the Executive gets on withits job.    The Authority will not concern itself withthe day-to-day operation of transport services.Nevertheless cases may occur whore the Executive isnot willing to provide a particularly mircmunerativeservice which the Authority none the loss considersto bo essential to the social needs of the Area.    Insuch cases, the Authority will have power to direct theExecutive to provide the service, but the Executivemay in these cases require the Authority to precept forthe loss in providing it.38.      The Minister concerned will have power to fix byOrder either generally or for a particular authority the maximum sum which may be raised by precept.Before making the Order the Minister will consult the relevant local authorities.Powers of the Executive39.      The powers of the Executives will be widely drawnso that they arc not handicapped by being unable tocarry out activities in which they are qualified orequipped to engage and for which they have thenecessary resources.40.      They will have power ta run bus services notonly within its own Area but to any place outside(it will of course require road service licences for bus services outside its area in exactly the same way as anyother operator).    Subject to this it will bo free if itso desires to operate long-distance bus services or to/run
run excursions and tours.    In certain specialcircumstances it may also run bus services betweenpincos both of which are near its Area but in factoutside it.41.     Tho Executive will have powor to let passengervehicles on hire and to engage in contract carriageoperations but, if it docs this it must publishsoparato information about the extent and financial results of this activity.    And if tho Ministerconsiders that an Executive is parrying on thistypo of business on the basis of charges which areunduly low, tho Minister can direct the Executive to change its policies or even to drop the businessentirely.    It may be also of advantage to tho travellingpublic for the Executive to enter into agreements withtaxi.firms or to supplement the taxi services in thoArea, but they will have no power to acquire taxifirms compulsorily and will bo subject to theusual licensing procedure.42       The Executive will have power to run rail andferry services within its area or to places near itsArea.    Examples of such activities would be a nowunderground railway and the ferries across the mersey.    Tho Executive will not have power to engage in on long-distance rail or sea services.43.      Tho Executive will also have power to carry out a wide range of ancillary activities which arcnaturally related to their main function of securingthe prevision of public transport.    Examples are(a) the carriage of luggage, parcels and othergo ods in thoir buses;(b) providing interchanges such as bus stations and car parks associated with the public transport system;(c) running refreshment rooms, left luggageoffices and other amenities required by(d)     constructing or repairing anything requiredfor the purposes of their business.letheir transport services;
44.     The Executive will have power to continue tocarry on any activity which was being carried proportionate tho time of transfer by the municipal busundertakings in its area.    Eor example somemunicipal undertakings run. a parcel service in thoarea, while others carry out servicing -aid repair of vehicles owned by other municipal departments.    It is obviously sensible that an Executive should bo ableto go on doing so.45.     The Executive will have power to acquire byagreement land or undertakings needed for its business, and to develop their land cither for itsown business  or (with the consent of the Minister)for athor purposes.    The Executive will howeverrequire the consent af the authority and the minister if it wishes to soil or lease any part of itsundertaking to other transport operators.46.      The Executive will have power to formsubsidiary companies to run public transport services or other activities rather than operating thorndirectly itself.47.      The Executive will therefore have wide powersend great flexibility both in the manner in which ituses then and in the organisation of its ownundertaking.    This will enable each Executive towork out arrangements which fit in tc its ownlo c a 1 c ond i t i on s.4 8.      Long-1 era p la liningThe Executive will.be required to prepare andpublish within two years, or longer if tho minister so allows, a plan for tho future development of the passenger transport system in tho Erea.    This plan will have to be worked out in close consultationwith the local planning authorities; the main elements in the public transport system - such asrailway developments or rapid transit systems - willalso appear in part of the  Structure plans&apos; which local planning authorities will be obliged to prepareunder following planning legislation.
COPY NO : WiCABINETADDENDUM TO C(67)185Ministers may find it helpful to have the attachedsummary section of the White Paper on Public Transport and traffic.     It is intended to incorporate it as Chapter XIIin the White Paper.Ministry of Transport, S.E.1.28th November 1967.
1,     The planning of public transport, particularly in ourcities, must be a responsibility of local rather thancentral Government.    It must be carried out in the conte tof transport plans prepared by local authorities.    (Section I).2.     Transport planning must be done over areas wider thanthose covered by any existing local authorities outside london.    Operation of the basic network of local passenger transport services is best carried out by publicly ownedbodies rather than by private companies responsible toshareholders.    (Section II).3.     The reorganisation of public passenger transportoutside London will be achieved by a twofold approach.First, powers will be taken to set up Passenger transport authorities - responsible to local authorities in their areas - where these are needed for unified planning oftransport.    Such Authorities will be set up immediately in greater Manchester, Merseyside, the west Midlands andTyneside.    (Section III - paragraph 2).h.     In the rest of England and   ales, the establishment ofP.T.As must depend on the clarification of the future shape of local government.    However the establishment of a NationalBus Company which will take over from the Transport holding company nearly all the main bus companies outside the bigcities will enable effective co-ordination of bus services to be achieved.    (Section III - paragraph 3).
5,     Passenger Transport Authorities consisting mainly ofmembers appointed by local authorities will themselvesestablish a professional Passenger Transport Executivewhich will be responsible for securing an integratedtransport system for the Area.   The executive will takeover the municipal bus undertakings in its a^-ea andreorganise them in sensible units with close local contacts.(Section IV para. 1-3).6.     A main task of the Executive will be to prepare a .:.SLanfor the Area to be approved by the Authority, which will cover all local transport services - road, rail, and ferry.This will involve detailed working agreements with both theNational Bus Company and with British Railways.    (Section IVparas, k - 19).7.     Control of broad -jolicy will lie with the Authorityitself which will in particular have to decide whether ornot operating grants are to be made to assist public tranoporin the ,..rea financed by precepts on the local authorities inthe -Area.    (Section IV particularly paras. 23 - 28).t).    The National Bus Company will be established to takeover the bus interests of the Transport Holding Company.    Itwill continue to operate as a commercial body through itsindividual subsidiaries.    Its financial responsibilitieswill be to break even year by yeai .   The Company will takeover responsibility from B.7,, for securing the provision of bus services to replace withdrawn railway sex-vices.    It will-operate closely with all other public transport operatorsparticularly PoT-As:. (Section V).
o      In Scotland a separate Scottish Transport Board will Beestahlished, responsible for bus services and local shipping services in Scotland.    It will take over- the interests or theTransport Holding Company in these fields together with certainshipping interests of British Railways.    (Section VI)10.   The Government is introducing large scale new measures for Government help for public transport.    The most importantwill be capital grants towards major new projects for investment in public transport in cities and towns such asthe improvement or extension of railways or the provision ofnew tubes, monorails etc.    (Section VII paras 1-9)11.   A new scheme for capital grants towards the purchase ofbuses for stage services will be introduced.    The grant willbe 25% of the cost and will be used, to encourage sfandardi-sation.     (Section VII paras 10-20)12.   The present grant to offset fuel duty on stage bus services will be increased from the present 1Od a gallonto l/7d a gallon so that the duty broadly reflects areasonable contribution towards the cost of providing theroads on which the buses operate.     (Section VII paras 21-23)13.   Tne Government will introduce special grants to P.T.4stowards the cost of any subsidies they have to give british railways for the maintenance of suburban rail services.These grants wall be tapered off over a period of years.(Section VII paras 26-29)14.   The Government will introduce grants to help bus services in remote country areas.    Half of the cost willhe met by the local authority,  the other half by thecentral Government.    A similar scheme will apply to ruralferry services.    (Section VII paras 30-3h)
-15,   Tiie powers of local authorities to make concessions for old people, the blind and disabled, on municipal bus under-taking s will be extended to arrangements for such concessionswith any operator of bus services.    Passenger transport authorities will be free to introduce general concessionsover the whole of their area if they think this desirable,(Sectiaa VIII)16.   A reduction in the length of tine for which bus driverscan be on Uuty each day and each week is being introduced.Discussions are continuing on how to achieve this without serious inconvenience to passengers or interruption of bus services.    (Section IX)17.   Ministers are asking local authorities in our towns andcities to prepare urban transport plans setting out how they propose to handle transport proble -is in their areas overtne next 5 to 7 years.    (Section X paras 3-6)18.   The system of highway capital grants will be extendedto grants for certain types of expenditure&apos; on major- traffic management schemes by local authorities.    (Section X para 7)19.    The powers of local authorities to achieve traffic management and control of parking will be widened;    and theneed for Ministerial approval of many of their regulation,orders will be abolished.    The powers of Traffic Wardenswill be widened.    (Section X paras 8-23)20.    The Ministry of Transport is embarking on a substantialprogramme of technical and economic research into theproblems of passenger transport particularly in urban areas.    (Section XI)
