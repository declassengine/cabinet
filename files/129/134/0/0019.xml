OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)65C(67) 190 COPY NO. _-11th December^ 1967CABINETBRITISH EUROPEAN AIRWAYS RE-EQUIPMENTMemorandum by the President of the 3oard of TradeLast month, I invited my colleagues (C(67) 177) to agree to british european Airways1 (BEA) request that they should order 30 of a new typeof British aircraft, the BA.C 2-11 (vv-ith an option on a further 10).    before a final decision could be reaached, devaluation occurred and made itnecessary to re-examine my proposal.    The outcome of this -examination is set out in a revised memorandum by officials at appendix.    This shows that the new exchange rate has had a markedeffect on most of the calculations, and strengthens the arguments which led me to recommend the BAC 2-11, in the first place.2.       Before corning to the details, I make a preliminary observation.First, devaluation does not alter the need for positive action tostrengthen the balance of payments.    It is so crucial to make a successof devaluation that we must over-insure;  that is, we must take micro-economic steps to aid exports in addition to the macro-economic effects of devaluation.    Secondly, devaluation in no way alters the need to be onthe lookout for every opportunity to use public sector expenditure to help the balance of payments and the BAC 2-11 decision should be judged inthis light.3.       Now as to details.    First, and most important, is the probable effect of devaluation on the export sales of the BAC 2-11.    For foreignoperators it should now be cheaper to buy and so cheaper (by about10 per cent) to operate than the Boeing 727/200, and we can think in termsof potential foreign exchange earnings of  300 million or more.    Bypaying (as compared with the alternative of the Trident 3B) an extra 46 million Exchequer finance for the BA.C 2-11, we could earn on thebasis of 150 sales an extra  258 million of foreign exchange, bothfigures discounted.    It is hard to see where in the economy  46 million could earn as satisfactory a return in terms of foreign exchange.4.      Thirdly, the increase since devaluation in international air fareswill greatly improve the operating results of BEAj at the end of 10 years,instead of showing an accumulated deficit, they will be well in surplus.The Exchequer will therefore save substantially because of devaluationwith any of the fleets under consideration; but BEA will be some 30 million better off at the end of the period if they have the BAC 2-11than they would be with the Trident.-1-CONF1DENT1AL
5.      Fourthly, the price advantage of the RB 211 new technology engineover its rivals has already been increased following devaluation.    rolls royce have already stated that, in their view, the chances of selling the rb 211 in the United States of America would be decisively helped if thatengine is first launched in the BAC 2-11.6,       Lastly, the consequences of devaluation for the European airbushave not yet been fully worked out with the French and Germans.    i donot myself believe that the two projects are mutually exclusive, or thatour decision to proceed with the BAC 2-11 will, by itself, lead to theabandonment of the airbus.    Both are speculative, but there should be substantially larger and earlier, foreign exchange earnings to be had from the BAC 2-11 than from the airbus0    Moreover if the Europeanairbus is not purchased but BEA have the BAC 2-11, then they will havean aircraft sufficient for their needs over the next 10 years.    Withouteither of these aircraft they will, like Air France, need an american aircraft larger than the Trident 3B well within 10 years.7.       To approve the BAC 2-11 rather than the Trident 3B means thatan extra  79 million would be required from the Exchequer ove- thenext five years.    Our primary object now, however, is to encourageexports.    It v/ould be reasonable not only to apply resources to thispurpose, in the form of the BAC 2-11, but by doing so to demonstrate Governments intention to take advantage of the new situation todevelop our technological resources and sell the product overseas.C.A.R.C.Board of Trade, S. W.l.11th December, 1967-2-
APPENDIXB.E.A.  RS-EgUIPMENTJoint Memorandum by Board of Trade and*    Ministry of Technolocr/pOff icialsMinisters will recall that in the summer of 1966 BEAwere refused permission to purchase a fleet of Boeing aircraft.It was announced that BEA would buy British aircraft and thataircraft under consideration were developed versions of theVC-10, the Trident and the BAC 1-11;    the Government wereprepared to give launching aid for the types selected andwould &quot;take steps to ensure that BEA is able to operate as a fully commercial undertaking with the fleet it acquires&quot;.2.     The BEA requirement fell into two parts.     The first wasmet by the purchase of an improved and larger version of the bac 1-11 - the BAC 1-11/500.     The second and larger require-ment was for an aircraft to match the Boeing 727 which is being acquired by continental competitors and to provide the largercapacity aircraft which will be needed as traffic grows on manyroutes at home and abroad.     Without further aircraft BEA willbe badly short of capacity to meet the growth in traffic from about 1969 until the airbus is available in 1973, but theaircraft they acquire will continue to be needed for manyyears after the airbus is available.3.     To meet this requirement for a larger aircraft intermediatebetween the jet aircraft now operated by BEA (e.g., Tridentwith about 100 seats) and the airbus (about 270 seats) therewere in August 1966 only the VC.10 which might be modified for short-haul use (175 seats) and an enlarged Trident which hasnow emerged as the Trident 3B (146 seats).     Meanwhile theBritish Aircraft Corporation have proposed a substantiallynew aircraft the BAC 2-11 (203 seats).     BEA asked in February1967 for permission to buy the BAC 2-11 on the ground that itwas the right intermediate size (about 200 seats) on the wayto the airbus, and had the attraction of being first in thefield of a new generation of quieter aircraft with goodoperating economics.4.     Of the five possibilities theoretically before us, twoappear to be ruled out in practice.     First, we assume that ministers will adhere to their previous decision not to permit the purchase of Boeings, even though Air France and Lufthansahave been allowed to acquire them.     Secondly, there seems no case for a modified VC.10, to which consideration was givenearlier, since this aircraft is rejected by BEA on operationalgrounds, and has no advantage on financial grounds.5.     Accordingly, in more detail, the paper discusses(a)   various possible fleets;1
CONFIDENTIAL 301Since any aircraft purchased are integrated with thewhole of BEA1s operations it is not possible to isolate their particular costs and earnings;   one hasto work on the total fleet.(b) the consequences for BEA&apos;s operational efficiency in financial terms;(c) aid to BEA;(d) incidence of Exchequer expenditure;(e) launching costs;(f) effect on the aerospace industry;(g) consequences for the balance of payments;(h) noise..6.     The figures on which this paper was originally based havebeen altered by devaluation and they have been reworked byBEA, the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Technology.     Thesignificant changes are:-(a) The nett present value of BEA&apos;s investment is substantially less unfavourable and the improvement is greater with a BAC fleet than with a Trident fleet.(b) The nett present value of the total investment isalso improved both as reflecting BEA&apos;s improvedposition and by virtue of contributions by the manufacturers.(c) The balance of payments calculations are affected bythe improved export prospects, particularly of the bac 2-11.     The Implied preference involved in the bac 2-11 is reduced.Possible fleets for BEA7.     BEA have reaffirmed unequivocally since devaluation thatthey still want the BAC 2-11.     They have, however, re-evaluatedother possible courses.     The various &quot;mixes&quot; of aircraft forwhich a detailed analysis has been made, which are unalteredby devaluation, are shewn in Table I.    The main assumptionswhich BEA have made and discussed with Departments are set out for reference at Annex A.     These have been altered, and arein some respects, open to qualification.     As far as Tridentsare concerned it will be seen that a fleet with a reducednumber of Tridents and a greater number of airbuses has been included as well as the &quot;mix&quot; that BEA themselves would prefer.The new aircraft of whatever sort would be absorbed graduallythroughout the 1970s.TABLE  IALTERNATIVE BEA FLEETSTypes of Aircraft	Seats	BAC 2-11 Fleet	Trident Fleet	Seduced Trident Fleet	Existing Types FleetBAC 1-11 (18 on order)	97	23	21	21	25Trident 2 (15 on order)	106	21	17	17	25BAC 2-11	203	34	-	-	-Trident 3B	146	-	47	30	-Airbus	267 - 	15 ONFIBENl	18 SAL	31	42
Consequences for BEA8.     (a)   Effect on BEA&apos;s investment and profit and lossaccountThe results now expected by BEA, on the assumptions theyare using, with each of these fleets are shewn in Table II.This is done in two ways.     First is shewn how long BEA would expect to make losses;   what their accumulated deficit wouldbe at the end of that period;    and how far that would bereduced, by 1978/79, by subsequent annual surpluses.     Secondthe nett present value of these results is shewn in terms ofdiscounted cash flow with the internal rate of return this represents.     It is to be observed that the figures representnett results of very large sums of revenue and expenditure over the years *TABLE II  millionB.E.A. FINANCIAL FORECAST	A c c o untancy Terms			D.C.F.

The problem is different because B.O.A.C.had a heavy accumulated deficit;    the objective here is toavoid such an accumulation as a millstone round the neck of.E.A. and the Government.     It is important to give B.E.A.aid during the next few years when otherwise, even taking account of devaluation, they would be accumulating a deficit,and to avoid the implication that the deficit (or the aid)is directly related to the economics of the British aircraft.3
10.    Against this must be set the fact that over the 10 year period B.E.A. will, with the B.A.C.  2-11 or the Trident 3Bfleets expect to show a profit.     The profit will, however,only accrue in the latter part of the period, and on B.S.A.&apos;s figures,  even with the best fleet, B.E.A. would be in deficit for about 6 years.     Provided there are adequate means ofrecouping the aid when B.E.A. can afford repayment, devaluatio]does not provide an adequate ground for saying that the government&apos;s pledge no longer need apply.     It remains truethat even the B.A.C. 2-11 solution would be less profitablefor B.E.A. than the Boeing fleet it originally chose,although the margins are very much narrowed as a result of devaluation.11.      The method proposed, after discussion with B.E.A., isthat their existing borrowings should be reduced by a givensum and that a special &quot;fund&quot; of the same amount should be created for the purpose of sustaining their revenue accountduring the period of anticipated losses.     This transactionwould not require the provision of additional Exchequer money.But because it would involve writing off part of theCorporation^ debt to the Exchequer, it would require legislation.   Although the creation of the special &quot;fund&quot;reduces the interest payable by B.E.A. and receivable by theExchequer, B.E.A.&apos;s need to borrow during the same period is reduced to the same extent and, thus, the call on Exchequerfunds remains the same.     A predetermined sum would betransferred from the &quot;fund&quot; to the revenue account each years as to afford B.E.A., on the basis of present forecasts of operating conditions and out-turn, the opportunity to achieve a reasonable margin of profit.    From these profitsa reserve would be gradually built up.    At the end of theperiod for which aid is required B.E.A. could be expected tobe able to operate in a fully commercial fashion withoutsupport.     It would then be open to the Government either toreclaim the reserve (which could be done under existing powers) or to convert it into interest-bearing borrowingsor equity capital.12       These matters will have to be settled before BEA finallycommit themselves to the purchase of aircraft.   negotiations are continuing about the exact size of the fund involved butthey should not exceed the following amounts for thevarious fleets discussed.B.A.C.  2-11 Fleet  23MTrident 3B Fleet  35MReduced Trident 3B Fleet  50MExisting types Fleet  55MThese sums do not, of course, modify the financial figures given in paragraph 8,  since they represent no more than themethod to be adopted, for helping BEA to deal with the   shortfalls shown there.    The Board of Trade are resisting BEA1sclaim to be compensated to the full amount of the differencebetween the fleet they acquire and the Boeing fleet.j3.     Relative National cost the figures in Table II are the results for BEA on theassumption that launching costs are borne by the Government.Table III shows these costs, combines them with the value ofBEA1s investment as in Table II, and shows therefore thetotal nett present value of the investment.4

The above figures of nett launching cost take account ofthe levy receipts expected from increased sales, subsequent to devaluation.     They also reflect the contribution the manufacturers have now agreed to make to these launching costs.Exchequer Expenditure15.     An analysis has been made of the incidence of the fundingby the Treasury of B.E.A. and of the aircraft industry (inits civil role) over the next five years in respect of thedifferent B.E.A. fleets considered in this paper.     In this context it is the gross launching cost (not discounted as above) that ,is relevant,  120M for the B.A.C. 2-11 and 15M for the Trident 3-B.     The results are shown in Annex Band for completeness cover Concord development and production which is of no relevance to B.E.A.SUMMARY OF B.E.A.&apos;s POSITION16.     These tables show that the B.A.C.  2-11 is rightlypreferred by B.E.A. on financial grounds - in nett presentvalue terms it is  13M better than the full Trident fleet or 27M better than the reduced Trident fleet - as well as becauseof its advantages in size and quietness.    Equally they makeit clear that the B.A.C. 2-11 is the most expensive investmentwith launching cost taken into account, involving an additional cost in discounted terms of some  40-45M and in Exchequer terms,an outlay of some  80M(undiscounted) greater from 1967/8-1971/2.It provides, however, the balance of payments advantages discussedbelow.Cost and Balance of Payments effects on B.A.C. 2-11 andTrident 3B17.     The calculations below take into account, as far as theycan at present be assessed, the effects of devaluation on the costs, prices and sales of aircraft.5
18.      Launching costs for the Trident 3B will because of devaluation rise by a small amount to  17.4M but the costtothe Government has been reduced to a ceiling figure of 15.225M by the contribution of 12.5 per cent which H.S.A.has now offered.     In addition royalties of about  ^M mayhave to be paid in respect of the booster engine.19.      B.A.C. have not increased their estimate for theB.A.C. 2-11 and have now offered to contribute 10 per centtowards the airframe launching costs provided they receive an initial order from   B.E.A. for not less than 20 aircraft.On the formula they have adopted, this works out at about 7.5M and reduces the estimated cost to H.M.G. for airframeand engine to some  120M.     This is not a ceiling figure,since B.A.C. are not prepared to accept an upper limit toour 90 per cent contribution.     It does, however, include a contingency margin of  10M and is probably a safe figure.B.A.C. would propose to recover their contribution overapproximately the first  40 sales;        H.M.G.&apos;s contribution would be recovered over about 250 sales.20.      The price to B.E.A. of both aircraft will remain unchanged.21.      B.A.C. and H.S.A. propose to increase the export priceof the aircraft to allow for the higher costs of imported materials and equipment, but, provided wage levels do notrise in the United Kingdom, there will be a net price improve-ment of 9-10 per cent to overseas operators.     The Ministryof Technology believe that in consequence the operating costs of the B.A.C. 2-11 to overseas operators should be 10 per centcheaper than the Boeing 727-200 while the operating costs for the Trident 3B would be about the same as the Boeing.22.     These improvements will increase the export prospects of the aircraft but officials consider that both companies are over-optimistic in their assessment of export sales.B.A.C. estimate 200-350 aircraft sales but officials considera more realistic estimate would be 150-200 including100-150 exports.23.   H.S.A. forecast 30-100 export sales for the Trident 3B.Officials think this is optimistic and rank the prospectsas only small.   However about 20 import saving sales mightbe achieved.Prospects for the EB 2-11 Engine24.     On past experience the export potential is greater forengines than for airframes.     It is therefore of the utmost importance to give Rolls-Royce a secure basis for developingat least one of their new technology engines, RB 207 or RB 211.The RB 207 will go into the airbus, but we shall not be sureuntil the middle of next year that the airbus will go ahead.The RB 211 is on offer for an American Lockheed or Douglasairbus, but it faces strong competition from American engines.In these circumstances, the BAC 2-11 provides the one presentapplication for a new technology engine entirely within our control.25..     Rolls-Royce1 s chances of winning contracts for theEB 211 in the American Airbuses are improved by devaluation6
and therefore the possibility of relieving the BAC 2-11of some of the engine launching costs should be greater.However, before devaluation, the RB 211 already had a priceadvantage over its American rivals and, whilst a reductionin Rolls-Royce price must be in the Company!s favour, itis not possible to assess the extent to which chances haveimproved.Airbus26.     For the Airbus the United Kingdom share of development costs before devaluation was 50% (made up of 37.5% for the airframe and 75% for the engine).     After devaluation,assuming United Kingdom internal prices do not rise,maintaining the United Kingdom share in terms of francs,will be approximately 46%.     To restore this to 50% in termsof francs would mean transferring some  7M   of work to theUnited Kingdom.27.     In the general context of all collaborative projectsthought is being given to the way in which this situation on the Airbus, together with implications on shares of levy on sales, should be handled in consultation with the Frenchand Germans as is provided for in the Memorandum of understanding.28.     Because of devaluation the price of the Airbus to BEAwill be increased by some 10%.     To overseas customers theprice could either be held to provide a larger levy or bereduced.   Which of these alternatives is best cannot bedecided before the contractors have provided comprehensiveinformation about costs and prices, as they are required todo, in April next.     However, in general, it is clear thatdevaluation improves the chances of making the Airbus a viable project.Aircraft Industry Policy29.     Aircraft industry policy is now firmly based on part-nership with Europe, since we do not rate very highly the chances in future of selling large civil aircraft in world markets, in the face of increasing American and Russiancompetition, unless they have as a starting point an assuredmarket in Europe.   This was the basis of the decision to start the airbus.30.      The BAC 2-11 would run counter to this policy.      OnBEA1s plans, assuming they buy the BAC 2-11 in the numbersnow proposed,  they would not require more than 15 airbusesby 1980.     Unless BEA were prepared to adjust this figureupwards - and Sir Anthony Milward has indicated a readiness,if necessary, to consider some adjustment between numbers ofthe two types - it would be difficult to achieve theassured market of 75 aircraft which we regard as a minimum for continuing the airbus project, particularly as Air Francehave already been allowed to buy Boeings as an intermediateaircraft.      To the extent that the BAC 2-11 sold abroad itwould constitute a threat to airbus exports.31.      The Trident 3B would also, to a less extent, run counter to the European policy.    If BEA have no new type of aircraftthey will have to take something like 40 airbuses;    theiroptimum Trident fleet would leave a demand for only 18 air-buses and even the reduced Trident fleet which has beenconsidered calls for no more than 26 airbuses.     But no exportsof the Trident 3B that would further prejudice the airbusmarket are expected.7
32.     As a continuation of a European policy we should, inthe view of the Ministry of Technology, plan towards a200-seat aircraft of advanced design (a &quot;minibus&quot;) as acollaborative project entering service in 1975 or later andaimed at a wider market than the purely national BAC 2-11.Conceived as a Boeing 727/200 successor,  and sufficientlyup to date in concept to go on selling into the 1980s in the face of competition,  such as aircraft might hope to achievesales of 200/250 in all, earning for the United Kingdomforeign currency to a nett present value of  150/200M.We should lay claim to design leadership (since the Frenchare leading on the airbus).     The minibus, following the airbus, might possibly be the start of a European family of aircraft and therefore lead to continuing export sales.33.     The policy will, of course, not be without difficulties.There can be no assurance that the technical improvementsnecessary for a successful minibus will prove feasible, or that other countries can be persuaded to join in or accept our leadership.     It is likely to be in direct competition with the American design.     The French have agreed that officials should discuss this project, and are thought to have accepted the philosophy of a European family of aircraft,but we know that French finances are already strained by thecurrent aircraft programme.     Alternatively they may proposea smaller aircraft of some 100 seats capacity, and this willhave to be considered on its merits.Manufacturing considerations34.     The BAC 2-11 would be designed and built by BAC atWeybridge where a sharp rundown of design work is threatenedon completion of the BAC 1-11.     All things being equal, weshould aim to maintain this team, since it is the only onewhich has achieved real success in the major civil aircraftfield.     However, in the absence of the BAC 2-11 we mightemploy the nucleus of the team in preliminary studies toestablish the feasibility and economics of a minibus concept(at a cost in the order of  1-2M a year).     The Trident 3Bwould be designed and built by HSA at Hatfield.     Without itthere would be a shortage of work at this factory until the airbus gets underway.     HSA might decide to close productionthere (and build the Airbus at Chester) in which case therewould be several thousand redundancies at Hatfield during thenext 12 months, starting immediately.Balance of Payments35.     A summary of the balance of payments implications isgiven in Table IV below including figures for the predevalua-tion forecast of 100 total sales for the BAC 2-11 (includingBEA).     The totals show the very large positive balance if the bac 2-11 fleet were chosen, and the significant deficit ifBEA were left to adopt the &quot;existing type&quot; fleet.8

Figures for the import content of the domestic productionof each fleet include airbuses in excess of the minimumrequirement of 15 since this is the least number neededbefore 1977/78 for any of the fleets.2.     The addition shown to BEA&apos;s foreign exchange earningsarises because BEA&apos;s overall results would be improvedcomparatively with the BAC 2-11 fleet, both becauseforeign travellers are expected to prefer it with itsquieter engines and because of its somewhat lower costsabroad in relation to capacity.3.     In the figures account is taken of the expected import saving element in sales to United Kingdom independentairlines.     For example, the BAC 2-11 figure of  307Mis based on expected export and import saving sales (withspares) of 116 aircraft (on top of which are 34 home sales to BEA, making 150 in all).Aircraft noisethe aircraft underThe BAC 2-11 andcon-the36.     The noise characteristics ofsideration are set out in Annex C,airbus are the only two types which would incorporate advanced technology engines, intrinsically much quieter than those in use now.     The Trident 3B, like the Boeing 727-200, is not significantly different from current aircraft.
37.      If BEA buy the BAC 2-11 in the numbers they propose,by 1973 something like 40% of BEA1s movements to the Londonairports or about 16% of the total of all airlines, wouldbe with these quieter engines.     Similarly, maximum deploy-ment of the airbus would have attraction from this point ofview.     Existing types of aircraft, or * stretched&apos; versionsof them, would precede the new noise certification schemeand at least initially, not be affected by it.     It has tobe recognised, however, that noise suppression will havegrowing importance during the lifetime of the aircraft now tobe ordered and it is possible that the Trident 3-B which,like the Boeing 727, is well above the criteria to beapplied, will have to be re-engined or retired well beforethe end of its service life.38.     BEA are well aware of the advantages to them ofquieter engines, and have assumed that they would obtain ahigher utilisation of the quieter BAC 2-11, especially at night, than of the Trident 3-B.     BEA are also aware of thedanger of restrictions on the Trident 3-B and Sir AnthonyMilward has made it clear that, if he is compelled to take it,he will want a guarantee that it will be exempt from the noise certification scheme.     Clearly no such guarantee canbe given and it may be necessary instead to promise herealso to make good any losses incurred as a result of noisepolicy.39.     In addition to the advantage to BEA, an attempt has beenmade to evaluate the amenity benefit of the BAC 2-11 to thepublic.   At busy airports, like Heathrow which is BEA&apos;s mainbase and where there is a high rate of air transport landingsand take-offs with a general high noise level and intermittentbursts of high intensity, the presence of some quiet aircraft will only marginally affect amenity nearby.     At less busyairports the relative importance of some quieter aircraft willbe greater but the loss of amenity due to noise at thoseplaces is, in total, very much less.     Furthermore the numberof movements that BEA will make with their new aircraft at these places is small in relation to their activity at heathrow.     Overall, the value of the improvement in amenitynear airports where BEA operates is considered to bemarginal in relation to the other sums involved in choosingan aircraft for BEA but so far as there is an advantage itlies with the BAC 2-11.BEA&apos;s position40.     Finally, it is necessary to have regard to BEA1s positionin all this.     By refusing their first choice, the Boeing727 and 737, the Government have already once overruled their judgment.     If now HMG refuse to make the BAC 2-11 availableagainst their considered preference (and furthermore insist onreducing the number of Trident 3-Bs below what they regard as the optimum) HMG1s judgment will have been substitutedfor that of the BEA Board.     BEA is a national asset and HMGare bound to attach importance to their success in carryingout their statutory responsibility to provide an efficient andeconomic airline.41-.     On the other hand the BAC 2-11 had not been conceivedat the time BEA were refused permission to buy Boeing aircraft.The alternatives under consideration then were much lessexpensive in launching aid than the BAC 2-11 and it was thesesmaller sums the Government was prepared to pay when it madeits decision.     While the BAC 2-11 fleet gives the bestinternal rate of return on BEA&apos;s investment on their10CONFIDENTIAL
assessment none of the fleets of British aircraft examined by BEA ensures an 8% a year return on capital invested inBEA, even after devaluation, the criterion laid down in therecent White Paper on financial objectives for the nationalised industries as the minimum return on new investment.Summing-up42.   While the figures in the tables in this paper are reasonably reliable as a guide to the relative values ofthe fleets considered they are not entirely solid in absolute terms.     In particular, the total capacity in aircraft theairline needs to meet forecast traffic demand cannot be certain and, indeed, could be influenced by the conclusionsof the Edwards Committee.     It is not necessary to decide the precise numbers of aircraft to be purchased now.     When the type to be bought has been chosen BEA would, in accordancewith usual practice, place an initial order for feweraircraft than they expect to need and take options, whichmay be turned into firm orders later, on additional aircraft.43.     There is no dispute that for BEA the BAC 2-11 is the bestpurchase;    it presents the only worthwhile prospect of earnings from export enhanced since devaluation;    that it isattractive from the point of view of noise;    and that it isthe only project wholly within our control that will providea basis for Rolls- Royce new technology engines.     On theother hand this is the most expensive solution although these advantages might perhaps justify a heavy expenditure on.launching costs if this were also desirable on industrialgrounds.   Against this has to be set the judgment of theMinistry of Technology that to develop the BAC 2-11 would seriously prejudice, if not even put an end to, the airbusproject and the prospects of an integrated European aircraftmanufacture on which we are predicating our present policy for the aircraft industry and our future hopes of sellinglarge civil aircraft in world markets.44.     if we do not proceed with the BAC 2-11 it would bepossible to go to the other extreme, refuse to develop theTrident 3B- and leave BEA with no alternative to making do with the existing types, i.e. Trident 2 and BEA 1-11/500.This, because we shall have no launching costs to meet,gives a relatively good present value for the whole invest-ment, and would have the effect of maximising BEA1s need forthe airbus.     But it is not only financially less attractive to BEA than other courses but would leave them with moreobsolescent and too small aircraft to meet the competition of airlines which are acquiring larger American aircraft and a very difficult transition to the airbus.45.     Accordingly if we do not proceed with the BAC 2-11,  thebest alternative to be offered to BEA, in the view of thetwo Departments, is the Trident 3B.     If that course ischosen it is necessary also to decide whether BEA should beallowed to acquire what they regard as the optimum &quot;mix&quot; ofTridents and airbuses, or whether, as the Ministry of technology would wish, the number of Tridents should bekept to a reasonable minimum so as to maximise BEA1ssupport for the airbus.     The reduced Trident fleet whichhas been considered is shewn in Table II to leave BEA witha deficit after 10 years some  24M greater than would thefull Trident fleet, and to have present value, as shewn in11
Table III, some  14M worse than that fleet.     It could onthe other hand lead BEA to order 31 airbuses instead of eighteen and the advantage of the larger seating capacityof these more economic aircraft would show increasinglyin the later years outside the period surveyed by this paper.46.     if it were decided not to proceed with the BAC 2-11the Ministry of Technology would propose a small study contract to cover preliminary design investigations into a minibusand with the aim of conserving the nucleus of a team atBAC, Weybridge, which would lead on such a project.Board of Trade, S.W.I.8th December, 1967.12
B.E.A.&apos;s ASSUMPTIONSBoEoAc have based their calculations of the fleet they requirete main assumptions set out below.1.   Fleets are based on matching expected traffic growth,international and domestic.    This is taken as 10^&amp; falling to 8% annually for international passenger traffic and atvarying amounts, according to the fleet chosen, falling to7% for domestic traffic.   Freight is assumed to increase at 20% annually.2o   All jet operations as soon as possible are assumed on international routes and parity of equipment and opportunity with independent airlines is assumed for the1970s on domestic routes.3.   The results assume actual anticipated cost and revenue forthe first three-four years at expected fares and wage rates.   In subsequent years fares and wage rates areassumed to move in parallel.k.   The results are much affected by the extent to which B.E.A.consider they will be short of capacity, or unable to operate matching services with their competitors, in theearly years.   All fleets, including the Boeing fleetoriginally asked for, would be expected to become profit-able, though to differing extents.5.   The notional Boeing fleet assumes payment of Import Duty.6.   Adjustments for devaluation(a) International fares:    Passenger fares and cargorates, expressed in sterling, have been raised by12-kfo on average.   It is assumed that an increase ofin passenger fares in April, 1969? previouslyforecast, will not now take place.   Mail rates have risen automatically by 1h per cent but may be reducedby negotiation.    It has been assumed that over thenext 10 years the increase will average 10%.(b) Traffic:    U.K. originating holiday traffic will be adversely affected in 1968/69 by the higher fares andholiday prices abroad, the maintenance of the  50overseas travel allowance and uncertainty during thebooking season of the effects ef devaluation and theaccompanying economic measures.    On the other handincoming tourist traffic and business traffic isexpected to be increased.    Overall internationalpassenger traffic in 1968/69 is now forecast to be only 3% more than in 1967/68;    6% less than was fore-cast before devaluation.   It is expected to recoverto the rate previously forecast by 1971/72 and tocontinue as in the pre-devaluation forecast until1977/78.    No change in the previous forecasts for international cargo and mail are expected;    increasedcarriage of exports being offset by reduced carriage of imports.43ANNEX A
Bnard of Trade CommentBoEoAo&apos;s traffic forecasts made before devaluation are considered, reasonable though cautious.   Their cost and revenuefigures are more open to doubt in detail, but it is consideredthat in the earlier years they indicate fairly the likely trendslith each fleet and the relativities between them.The adjustments that B.E.A. have made to take account of theeffects of devaluation seem to be pessimistic.   No traffic increasehas been forecast in the 1970s from the higher personal disposableincome per head, after allowing for price changes, that will result from the success of devaluation and the Government&apos;s other economic policies.   B.E.A. agree that if their traffic grows faster by oneper cent a year after 1971/2, as a result of devaluation, the netpresent value to them of the additional traffic, after deductingthe cost of carrying it, is about  7 million.   Furthermore, theassumption that an increase in 1969 dn European international faresto meet rising costs will not occur and that fares will continue tolag behind costs for a decade without affecting the volume oftraffic must be questienable.    The net present value of the fareadjustment, or the traffic generated without it, might be about 25 million.The financial consequences of these assumptions are substantialbut may not materially affect the differences between the fleets.14
