DOCUMENT is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government).ci LLiZ2 copy no.  y ?j15tja Ncyyember, 1967cabinetbritish railways board salaries memorandum by the Minister of TransportMy colleagues will be aware of the urgent need to reconstitutethe Board of the Railways in order that it may quickly get down to workon the tasks outlined in the Morris Report on the reduction of the deficit and on preparations for the formation of the National freight corporation.    I expect soon to receive the resignation of the presentChairman.    So, with other retirements which have already been agreed.,I shall be in a position by the end of the year to effect an extensivereconstitution of the full-time membership of the Board.2.     The immediate need is a new Chairman.    An ending of the present uncertainty and speculation about the succession is essential to therestoration of the very depressed morale of the Board and also of itssenior officers.    Other new appointments are also needed both tostrengthen the Board and to replace members who are being retired.These must be made in consultation with the new chairman. * For allthese reasons I want to get him appointed immediately.3.     I propose to appoint Mr. Peter Parker.    After a very thorough examination of a number of alternatives I am convinced he will bring tothe Board the qualities that we need.    It is already clear that he willbe able to establish an effective working relationship with the Vice-Chairman of the Board, Mr. Johnson, who as a railwayman of long experience will provide exactly the right balance to him.4,    Mr. Parker is in principle ready to accept the chairmanship.He is not, however, prepared to accept the present salary of 12,500 because it would leave inadequate headroom for the salarieshe considers it essential to pay the deputy chairman and other membersof the Board and chief officers.    He has himself been offered a salary of  15,000 for the post of an ordinary full-time board member of the steel Corporation.    He considers that it would create a most unfortunateimpression, especially in view of the low morale at BRB headquarters,as his very first act he were to accept a salary which effectivelymade it impossible to attract Board members of the right calibre andto reward chief officers who, under the Joint Steering Group&apos;srecommendations, will have greatly increased responsibilities.    In hisopinion, we need to offer full-time Board members at least  13,000and probably more.    He also believes that the new post of deputy chairman and Chief Executive recommended by the Joint Steering Group,for which Mr. Johnson is the obvious choice,, is of such vital importance-1-
in the new organisation that it should command a salary of  17,500.This would lead to a salary for the chairman of not less than S 20, 000.In view, however, of the difficulties that the payment of such salarieswould cause at the present time, he would accept appointment at a salary of  17,500.    He attaches great importance, however, to the deputy Chairman being paid  15, 000.5,     I am convinced that Mr. Parker is right.    It was clear from thesoundings I took of other potential Chairmen that the general view wasthat the right salary band for chairman was about  20,000 to  25,000,with corresponding uplifts in the salaries of other Board members.The soundings already taken by management consultants in relation to possible  candidates for the key posts of &quot;Vice-Chairmen for finance and planning make it clear that we shall have to pay something like 15, 000 for them.    Two of the suggested named were the FinanceDirectors of Courtaulds and Associated Electrical Industries.     Theyare paid  18, 000 and  20, 000.6.     If we start off the reconstitution of the Board in a half-heartedmanner v/e will defeat our own objects.    I recognise that we will haveto take more time in deciding the appropriate salaries for full-time members other than the Chairman and Deputy-Chairman.     But the urgency of getting the two top salaries more nearly right, and of getting the new Chairman appointed, are such that we cannot wait for the outcome of a general review of nationalised Board salaries.7.     I seek my colleagues agreement, therefore, to Mr. Parkerbeing paid a salary of  17,500 per annum and Mr. Johnson  15,000,on a personal basis in each case.    I should also like to tell Mr. Parkerthat the salaries for full-time Board members are likely to be reviewed in the immediate future.B. A. C.Ministry of Transport, S. E, 1.14th November, 1967.-2-
