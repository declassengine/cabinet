J/IENT IS TKE PPx-OPERTY OF HER BRITANITIC MAJESTY rS GOVERNMENT)C(67) 183 COPY NO.    8 620th November, 1967CABINETBRITISH RAILWAYS BOARD salaries memorandum by the Minister of transport the Cabinet did not consider the two papers, by the chief secretary and myself, on the sala.ry of the British Railways Board(BRB) Chairman and Deputy Chairman (C(67) 181 and 179).    But theywere considered by a small group of Ministers.    I was invited to see Mr. Parker, and with all the earnestness at my command to invite himto accept the chairmanship of the BRB at the tariff salary ( 12, 500).    iwas authorised to assure him that this salary, and that of the deputy chairman ( 10,000) would be reviewed.2,      I saw him the same afternoon and later took him to see the PrimeMinister.    We did not prevail upon him.    He said he thought that for himto accept would be disastrous to any hopes of getting full support fromsenior railway management, or of strengthening it by bringing in high-calibre people from outside to fill key positions.    If he did not succeed in attaining those preliminary objectives, there was no hope of hisbringing round the railway industry so that it could implement theeconomic and social objectives set out in my White Paper (Cmnd. 3439).He said he attached, if anything, greater importance to the salary he had proposed for Mr. Johnson ( 15, 000) than to ids own33.      It is the intention that Mr. Johnson should fill a new post ofDeputy Chairman and Chief Executive in accordance with a recommenda-tion of the Joint Steering Group which the Government has accepted.    Whatis in question, therefore, is not an increase in salary but the rate of pay for a new job which involves a promotion,    At present the job of theChief Executive is being done by two Vice-Chairmen and at least oneof the functional members of the Board, and the Chairman himself isalso devoting part of his time to it.    It will be an essential corollary of the move towards a non-functional Board, as recommended by theJoint Steering Group, that these various executive tasks should be concentrated under the control of one man.4.      Today I again saw Mr. Parker and Mr. Johnson, to see whetherthey would be willing to reconsider their decision in the light of the newsover the weekend.    I proposed that in the changed circumstances theyshould accept the tariff salaries, on the basis that there would be an earlyreview of top salaries in nationalised industries generally, the results ofwhich would operate as soon as possible,    I cut no ice with either.
5,      Iv.tr. Parker said that he fully appreciated the Government^difficulties and was anxious to do all he could to help.    Nonethelesshe felt that he c ould not make a success of the job on the basis i had suggested.    It was of overwhelming importance to create the rightconditions for efficient management and it would be fatal to start onan unrealistic basis.    It was generally recognised, not least amongraihvayrnen, that very substantial increases in top nationalised industrysalaries (outside the Steel Corporation) were long overdue.    The point was strongly made that ordinary working railwaymen and middlemanagement have had increased rewards for increased effort, but these have not extended to top management.6,     For his part, Mr. Parker would be prepared to accept a temporaryabatement of 12J- per cent even though this would leave him with a salary( 15,300) little more than he was offered as an ordinary member of the steel Corporation.    Ke was, however, very insistent that Mr, Johnsonshould be offered a salary of  15, 000,    As I have explained in paragraph3, this is not an increased salary for doing the same job;   iv.tr. Johnsonis being asked to take a new job with very much greater responsibility.Mr. Parker stressed particularly that the proposed salary for mr. Johnson was essential to enhance the standing of the mostenior railwayman and also to help gain the acceptance of otherraihvaymen for a new comer as Chairman.7.     It is clear that Mr, Parker will not accept anything less than he has proposed.    If we cannot offer this, I am without a Chairmanfor BRB and cannot be certain of keeping lir. Johnson.    So I ask mycolleagues to accept the recommendations in my last paper, - subject only to a temporary abatement of 12-g- per cent of Mr. Parker &apos;s salary.iJ,Ministry of Transport, S.E.1,20th November, 1967
