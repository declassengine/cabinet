:ENT IS THE PROPERTY OF KER BRITANNIC PxAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO._15th November, 1967CABINS british RAILWAYS 3CARD SALARIESP.er.ior andum by the Chief Secretary,  treasury in her memorandum on this subject (C(67) 179) the I minister  ofTransport proposes that the salary of Mr. F&quot;eter Parker, as the newChairman of the British Railv/ays Board (BR3), should be  17, 500 ayear, and that of Mr. H. C. Johnson, as Deputy Chairman,   15, 000a year,2.      I do not think it would be right to agree to these salaries.    Inrecent years successive Governments have followed a clear policy of paying, with certain exceptions, members of nationalised boards on a standard &quot;tariff&quot;.     The current &quot;tariff&quot; rate for Chairmen of majornationalised industries is  12, 500 a year.     This is the salary paid tothe Chairmen of the National Coal Board and the Electricity Council,and to the present Chairman of the BRB.3.      Exceptions have been made when it has been essential to securethe services of a particular man from outside the industry, v/ho has been receiving more than the current &quot;tariff&quot; rate.    In such cases, personalrates have been paid.    However, the present cases are not of this type,Mr. Parker1 s current salary is  11, 500 a year;  and Mr. Johnson receives 10,000 a year, the current &quot;tariff&quot; rate for Deputy Chairmen of the major nationalised boards.4,      The salaries agreed for members of the British Steel Corporationearlier this year are, of course, not a parallel.     There it was necessaryto secure the services of men already receiving remuneration well abovethe current level of nationalised board salaries, and with protected salaryrights under the Nationalisation Act.5,      ivloreover, the Cabinet recently invited me (CC(6?) 62nd Conclusions,Minute 3) to consider the whole question of salaries of members of nationalised boards, including the reorganised BRB, and to put proposals to my colleagues.     This I hopo to do shortly.     But in rny view to decidenow to increase the general level of salaries for the BRB would seriously prejudice our consideration of the wider issue.    It would be difficult orimpossible to treat other nationalised industries differently from therailways.    hi effect we should be practically settling the whole question in isolation and without proper consideration of the issues.
6.      I do not under-estimate the difficulties that will face the reorganised BRB, as set out in the Minister of Transports memorandum.But they are difficulties that should be considered in the wider context.In my view, the right course is to pay Mr. Parker and Mr. Johnson thecurrent &quot;tariff&quot; rates ( 12, 500 and  10, 000 a year respectively) and toteilthem in confidence that v/e are considering the general problem of nationalised board salaries.     The salaries of the BRB would, of course,play an important part in our consideration.J.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.15th November, 1967
