,uivlENT is THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS GOVERNMENT);(67) 17565COPY NO.7th November, 1967G A3 INIINDUSTRIAL, EXPANSION BIldL: DRAFT WHITE PAPFRMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Economic affairs attach a report by officials on the outstanding policy issues onthis Bill as invited by my colleagues on 26th October, 1967(CC(67) 61st Conclusions, Minute 6).     This incorporates certain conclusions reached at a meeting that I held with the Ministers most directly concerned and recommendations on certain other points whichwe referred back to officials for further examination and legal advice,,2,      I also attach a revised draft of the T7hite Paper prepared by officials.    The only substantial amendment has been to the sectionfrom paragraph 12 onwards.     The reference to the industrial reorganisation Corporation and the National Research and development corporation (paragraph 17) would have to be cleared with them before publication,3.      I agree generally with the recommendations at the end of thereport, subject to the following points.    First, in paragraph 4, last sentence, I think the Advisory Committee should instead be limited tocommenting upon aspects involving discrimination and indicating ways of mitigating it.    Second, in paragraph 9, we must bear in mind the weight of opinion on our own side against leaving the nationalised industries out of the Bill altogether.     Third, I consider that thelimit on expenditure (other than on Concord and Cunard) should be capable of extension twice by Order, i. e. to a total of  200 million.Department of Economic Affairs, S.W.I.7th November, 1967
INDUSTRILL . BXP/JNSIO.N,,BILLRegport by..0fjCicialsThe Secretary of State for Economic Affairs was invited toarrange for officials to make recommendations on the outstandingpolicy issues on this Bill and the draft White Paper(CO (67) 6lst Conclusions).     These recommendations were con-sidered at a meeting (referred to in this report as &quot;the ministerial meeting&quot;) held &quot;by the Secretary of State for economic affairs and attended by the Minister of Technology, the chief secretary to the Treasury and the Minister of State, Board ofTrade.     This meeting reached conclusions on certain points and referred others back to officials for further examination and legal advice.2,    We have taken as our starting point that the Bill is intended;to enable the Government to give financial support to industrialprojects which will benefit the economy but which will not beundertaken unaided by the companies concerned because the risk is too great or the return inadequate to command sufficient financefrom commercial sources.      (The way in which this criterion is to&quot;be provided for in the Bill is being considered.)     To be eligible,projects must have one or more of the following purposes:-gb bbbJbSb&quot;b&apos;:&apos;&apos;; JggBs!lii&apos;ft(a)   to promote efficiency or (b) to support technological advanceor (c) to create,  expand or sustain productive capacity.MyXsory Committee3.    The technical and financial appraisal of schemes, and theconsideration whether there is unfair discrimination, will bedifficult and important, and the members of the Committee will havetote chosen with care.     The Ministerial meeting concluded that itwould be unwise to limit its composition to members of the Industrial^organisation Corporation (1958-59) and National Research development corporation (NRDC) and the White Paper should leave open the possi-Ulity of other appointments.
^    We envisage that the Advisory Committee would arrange for theappraisal of projects referred to it &quot;by the Government to he under-taken by a team drawn from the staff of the 1958-59 and the ITRDC, from outside consultants or from a combination of both.     The Committeewould be given guidelines by the Government as to the scope of itsencmiry and the factors to be taken into account;    and in the pro-cess of evaluation would consult departments and make use of such information as the Government could make available.      The appraisalwould establish such matters as the sum needed (and on what terms)to make the project financially viable, the quantifiable economiccosts and benefits not reflected in the financial analysis and,where necessary, the technical feasibility of the project.     Inappropriate cases, the Committee would say whether it thought thata proposed project involved unacceptable discrimination betweenfirms,5,   Reference to the Committee will have to be made in the Bill inorder to enable payment to members, if necessary;    and the Bill willalso need to enable the 1958-59 and NRDC to give such assistance to theCommittee and to Ministers as is necessary for the Committee&apos;s functions.6,    The White Paper should state that it is the general intentionto refer projects for advice, but that there may be exceptional cases where this would be clearly inappropriate.      It will not, forexample, normally be necessary to seek a further appraisal by thisCommittee where the project or scheme of development has alreadybeen exhaustively examined for the Government by an independent committee of enquiry; and there may be other unforeseen andexceptional cases where the Government would find it inconvenientor inappropriate to refer the project to the Advisory Committee.&quot;ie &apos;ffiite Paper should also state that the Government would reviewtne arrangements for evaluation and advice in the light of experience.      (This would leave it open to the Government to2.
consider later whether there is a case for building up within thegovernment the staff and knowledge needed to undertake the appraisaltask.)r    The Minister of Technology has proposed that the powers underthe Bill should be available not only to finance individual pro-jects but also to enable a Minister by Order under the Bill to setup a Board to advise on and perhaps supervise a series of relatedprojects to be undertaken within a single industry.      The minister would then finance these within the sum authorised by the Order.This may prove a convenient procedure to adopt for the purposes ofthe Bill in certain cases.     But we consider that such Boards shouldbe set up only in exceptional cases where;  (a)    there is a continuingindustrial operation to be carried through comparable with the actionnow being taken in shipbuilding;    and (b) there has been a preliminar-ary enquiry on the basis of which the Government has announced apolicy of support under the Bill.     We agree that if there are to be such Boards they should not have spending power of their own -other than (possibly) power to pay staff.       The Minister would, ofcourse, need to prove, within a general Order, particular expenditureproposals.M^jftries. to be .covcred.8.   The Ministerial meeting decided that the powers under the new legislation should be available to support eligible projects in any industry (including transport, distribution and other services) inthe private sector.      It would not, however, be the intention to use these powers in duplication of those which Parliament may already have provided for the desired purpose under separate legislation,e*g. the agricultural support legislation and the shipbuilding industry act.      (The latter has only recently been enacted and shipbuilding should, therefore, be explicitly excluded from the3.
^     The Ministerial meeting also decided that to bring the nationalised industries fully within the scope of the Bill would run counter to the philosophy underlying the new legislation whoseprincii3al purpose is to support private industry.      The mainactivities of the nationalised industries should, therefore, be excluded in terms from the scope of the Bill.      It was, however,thought desirable to have power to support the ancillary activitiesof nationalised industries as these are more closely comparable with activities in the private sector and are so treated for thepurposes of investment grants, etc.     There is some doubt whetherit would be necessary to take express power to support these acti-vities under the new legislation since the power would exist inany case so far as joint projects between a nationalised industryand a private sector company were concerned, and other ways of supporting wholly-owned subsidiaries of nationalised organisationscould be found in many cases.      If, however, Ministers wish to be certain that the power will always be available if required,  itwould bo desirable to draft the Bill in such a way as to make thisexplicit,     The manufacturing power of nationalised industries is,however, a highly sensitive question on which the CBI has in thepast made strong representations to the Government.      The inclusion in the Bill of a provision explicitly authorising the Government tosupport the ancillary activities of nationalised industries would,therefore, be likely to arouse further controversy with industry;and this would need to be weighed by Ministers against any disadvan-tages which would arise if such provision were not included.10.

CONFIDENTIAL 112AnnexDRAFT.. WHITE JPAPERINDUSTRIAL. EXPANSIONIntroductionOur national industrial policy is directed to promoting the efficient use of resources doth in the public and private sectors.     The success of this policy requires the maintenanceof a close working relationship between the Government andindustry.     A vigorous and successful private sector withina competitive economy is essential if a satisfactory rate ofeconomic growth - permitting higher standards of living and improved social conditions - coupled with a healthy balanceof payments are to be achieved.     At the same time it isgenerally recognised, here and in other advanced industrial countries that, although competitive market forces are a necessary spur to efficiency and provide an essential basisof investment decisions and the allocation of resources,they cannot by themselves be expected in every circumstanceto secure national economic objectives and the optimum useof resources, because of the possible divergence betweensocial and private costs and benefits.     for this reason,there has been a steady growth in the scale and variety ofGovernment measures affecting the private sector, whetherby the use of financial incentives to influence investmentdecisions in certain broad directions, or by support for particular projects.     The rapid advance of technology andthe increasing problems presented by the scale of inter-national competition are now giving rise to new needs in industry which call for a still more flexible response bythe Government.2,     Government and private industry have a common interestin industrial excellence and commercial success.     government policy is designed to facilitate the efforts of those
enterprising managements which are striving to meet the challenge of technical change and competition in world markets and to maintain and improve the efficiency andprofitability of their companies.     In the ordinary coursesuch companies will, continue to rely on their own resources,augmented &quot;by general schemes of fiscal incentives, or to command support from commercial sources and existing financial institutions.     The Government have no intention of dbispljaaingthese sources of finance.       Nevertheless, the Government mustbe equipped to provide measures of support where this isnecessary to secure the realisation of wider economic benefits.Existing partnership between Government and industry.      Support of this kind is not new.    In the past, direct government support for specific projects in the private sector has been given to older and less profitable industries and to industries meeting some national purpose, such asdefence or regional development.     More recently, theGovernment have provided finance for new and technologicallyadvanced projects where the potential benefits to the economywere greater than the returns which the companies concerned could expect to receive in the short term.      The programmes of assistance to computer and micro-electronics developmentare examples of this approach.     Another kind of special action,exemplified by the Ministry of Technology&apos;s pre-production orders for machine tools, is to facilitate the introductionof advanced equipment which is likely to be profitable, but which appears to involve too much risk for the customer until there has been experience of the new equipment.     Here theGovernment is reducing the marketing risks for the producer and the innovation risk for the customer.k*     This has taken place at a time when the Government and both sides of industry have been concerned to evolve effectivemethods of economic planning.     Within this setting industrial2.
policy has concentrated, first, on providing a series of measures designed to shift resources of manpower and capitalfrom less to more productive employment and to even out the geographical distribution of industrial activities;   and secondly, on providing assistance for structural change.Measures have been taken to encourage investment in modernplant and machinery in the manufacturing, extraction and construction industries;    to increase the benefits availableto industrial enterprise in Development Areas;   and to supporttechnological research and development in civil as well asin defence industries.5.     In particular, the resources of the N.R.D.G. have beenenlarged so as to enable it to support the development andexploitation of commercially promising projects within its scope.     The I.R.C. has been set up to promote, and where necessary to finance, the structural changes which moderntechnology and international competitive conditions require.At the same time the Minister of Technology has been given authority to engage in or support research and development and to further the application of the results.      These variouspowers have been used to good advantage as in the help givenby the N.R.D.C. in the fields of data-processing andantibiotics, by the I.R.C. to reorganisation within theelectronics industry and by assistance from the Minister of technology to automation schemes.nejedjFpr.jfurjther development of the partner,shigpo.     But it has become clear over the past year or so thatthese provisions are not enough to enable the Government totake the action needed to further their policy of seeking toensure that necessary investment in the interest of theexpansion of our industrial capabilities is not held back.7.    A main purpose of the Ministry of Technology from the start was to identify key points of growth and to bring abouta more rapid application of advanced technology.      The Ministry3.
has wide powers to support research and technological development, but the scope for exploiting the results ismore limited.    If the Government are to play their full part in the industrial expansion which technological development now makes possible, they must be able to operatemore directly and mor^ flexibly in support of industry tohelp overcome obstacles in the field of production and marketing as well as in research and development.    In the wider context of the reorientation of research and develop-ment policy, the Government consider there should be closerlinks between Government research establishments andindustrial companies which can exploit and market theresults of research so that they should be able to drawmore effectively on the resources of these research estab-lishments;    on occasions also, the Government may need toestablish a new industrial capability by themselves or in association with others.8.     One of the problems facing the national economy isthat investment programmes need to be sustained to providefor the future growth of demand.    Any decline in the levelof industrial expansion may lead to disproportionate falls in orders in the investment goods industries-    As a result,the industries concerned may have to reconsider theirexpansion and development plans.    If these are cut back and the employment of engineers and. skilled manpowerreduced, the capacity of these industries to meet investmentdemand when it eventually recovers will be inadequate.    Ifthe Government are to be in a position to support investmentat these times, they must be able to take steps, in additionto action under the Investment Grant Scheme,  to provide thenecessary assistance to appropriate key sectors of industry.The need for action of this&quot;kind in the machine-tool industry has recently been under discussion, but within existingh.
powers it has been possible to help only by increasing the pre-production order scheme.   Experience has shorn that other measuresof support, whether for this or other important sectors of indus-trjTj could not be speedily implemented without s eparate legisla-tion in each case.9,    The main task of the I.R.G.  is to promote industrial reorganisation although it may, if requested to do so by theSecretary of State for Economic Affairs, contribute to the develop-ment of individual enterprises.    The Government have close and regular contacts with the Corporation and intend to use its facil-ities to the full and to seek its advice whenever appropriate:,There will, however, be cases involving industrial developmentwhere action by the I.R.C, will not, for one reason or another,be suitable.    For example, there may be a need for long-termpublic participation arising from Government industrial or social policy, particularly regional policy, which the I.R.C. would not normally consider appropriate to its role.    The reorganisation ofthe shipbuilding industry is an example of an operation where adifferent approach was called for.10.   The further development of the Government&apos; s positive role aspartner with industry is therefore creating, new needs for legis-lation to deal with particular situations.    In the absence of newgeneral legislation, separate bills would be required to cover theneeds of the aircraft industry, for example, the financing of concord production.    The Government a re also considering proposalsfor the development of an aluminium smelting industry in Britain.This is a further example of the type of project which, under present arrangements,  would require separate legislation.11.  But the Government are not concerned solely with legislative authority for proposals which have already been worked out&apos;&quot;ith industry or are under negotiation.    They are also concerned*0 he able to respond promptly to further needs as they emerge.^ is important that, in exploring further possibilities,Especially those holding promise of future export growth, neitheriT.CONFIDENTIAL

Where a successfulbreah-through in development or production which is of particular value for the economy can he realised, hut where for special reasons adequate funds are not available from the company1 s own resources or through commercial channels, the Government shouldbe able to supplement those sources of finance speedily and effectively.l  Industrial,Expansion Bill12.   What is needed is a faster and more flexible procedure for implementing the G-overnment&apos; s side of its partnership with industry.   The Government therefore propose to introduce legislation to authorise the minister of Technology and other ministers with responsibilities for industries to provide direct assistance to projects designed to promote efficiency;    to supporttechnological advance;    or to create,  expand or sustain productivecapacity.13.   The Minister concerned, with the consent of the Treasury,would be empowered to give financial support which might, accord-in&amp; to circumstances , take the form of loans, grants, guarantees,the underwriting of losses or the purchase of equity shares toprojects falling within the purposes of the Bill.   For theMinister of Technology this would be a widening of the scope ofhis powers under the Science and Technology Act, 1965, forcarrying on or supporting scientific research or the dissemination0- the results of scientific research, and under the CivilAviation Act, 19d9, to support the design,  development and production of civil aircraft.    The new legislation would enable-fee Minister to support the design, development and productionof other products,  in addition to civil aircraft.^.   The powers under the new legislation would be available to
CONFIDENTIAL Hstfoport eligible projects in any industry (including services) inJhe private sector, except for shipbuilding for which there hasbeen recent legislation.    The Government do not, however,  intend to use these powers where the sane object could be achieved under existing legislation relating to the industry in question, forexample, the agricultural support legislation.   /The Bill would cover the ancillary activities of the nationalised industries,but not their main activities^15.   It is proposed to include in the Bill a limit to the totalof financial assistance which may be made available to industry under it;    and a separate limit relating to the productionexpenditure on Concord.Operagbion^pjC^the New Powers,16,   The Bill will not confer any compulsory powers, either directly or indirectly,    for the Government to use compulsionwould clearly not accord with their purpose of launchingsuccessful projects in partnership with private industry.    it follows that the Bill will not confer any powers to acquireshares in any industrial undertaking otherwise than by voluntary agreement.    The Government do not intend to acquire shares freelyon the market, and. would purchase holdings only in agreementwith the firms concerned.17.   The powers under the new legislation would be used only forprojects which would not take place -without Government support and here the Government judged it to be in the national interest10 give that support.   It is not intended to use them as a generalsubstitute for investment grants in industries which do not qualify under the Industrial Development Act, 1966.   projects to De considered for support would be carefully selected andihe provision of Government finance to them would be subject to110 less stringent examination than that applied to investment^ the private sector or in the nationalised industries..    TheGovernment would, submit these projects to a comprehensive
evaluation and a new advisory committee would be set up, containingmembers of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation and theNational Research and Development Corporation and drawing ontheir staff, to which it would be the Government&apos; s generalintention to refer projects for advice.    (There may be exceptional cases where such reference would be clearly inappropriate, as,for example, where the new legislation was used, to implement the recommendations of an independent Committee set up toexamine the problems of a particular industry.)    These arrange-isents for evaluation and advice would, be reviewed in the lightof actual experience.18.   The role of Parliament in the evolution of a closerpartnership between Government and industry is of critical importance.    In order to ensure that schemes put forward underthe new legislation are subject to proper scrutiny by Parliament,the Bill will provide that, before making use of new powersgranted under it, the Minister concerned would be required to define the scheme or specific proposal in an Order to be laidbefore Parliament and to obtain the approval of the House ofCommons for proceeding with it.19.   In exercising the powers under the new legislation, theGovernment would take full account of regional needs and pay aueregard to international obligations.CjgiiclAisi^on20.   In the Government&apos; s view the proposed measure is bothnecessary and urgent if schemes for industrial expansion are not so be delayed.   The Bill will provide the framework for a furtherstage in the development of Governments partnership with industryf0p tne encouragement of increased investment and more rapidapplication of modern technology.
