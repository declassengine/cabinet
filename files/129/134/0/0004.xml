COPY NO.7th November, 1967CABINETTHE TRANSPORT OF FREIGHT; DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Minister of transport in January, 1967 I put my proposals for the establishment ofa national freight organisation to the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy.    My proposals were approved subject to consultationwith the transport trade unions; and the Committee in February agreedthat, in the light of these consultations, I could announce theGovernment^ intentions in the debate on Transport ^Policy in the house the following week.2,      In July the Cabinet approved my proposals for revision of theroad haulage carriers1 licensing system (CC(67) 48th Conclusions,Minute 2), and in September I reported the results of my widespreadconsultations with industry and the unions to the Ministerial Committeeon Industrial Policy.    That Committee agreed to the modifications I proposed.3.      On these two main features of my proposals my consultations with all those directly interested on both sides of industry, includingthe Trades Union Congress and the Confederation of British Industries,have revealed a wide measure of acceptance, with the exception ofquantity licensing which, although accepted by the unions and particularlywelcomed by the rail unions, has, as expected, been opposed by the road haulage industry.4.      The working out of these two sets of proposals forms the basis for the White Paper on our policies for freight transport, which Ipropose should be published in advance of the forthcoming transport bill which I am hoping to lay before Parliament at the beginning of next month.    The White Paper, a copy of which is attached, also includes,in paragraphs 65 to 68, a reference to the new charges to be imposed on lorries in jroopsst of abnormal loads and wear and tear, agreed bythe Cabinet in the course of the Public Expenditure review on 20th July(CC(67) 50th Conclusions, Minute 3).    I propose to announce this newcharge on 9th November, before publication of the White Paper which Iwould hope would be on 14th November or soon thereafter.B. A.

TH&quot;.&quot;. TRANSPORT OF FREIGHTI:     INTRODUCTION-I       The basic objective of Government policy must be to improve the efficiency of the whole transport system.    Nowhere is thismore urgent than in the field of freight.    Cuick, convenient and economical means of moving goods are vital to industry.    At thesame time wider social and economic interests must not be overlooked.    Only in this way will the nation&apos;s resources be put to their best use.2.     The White Paper on Transport Policy, 1966-;, described thedistribution and expected trends of freight traffic and outlined the Government&apos;s new plan for freight.    Since then, in the light:.&apos;-&apos;&apos;vof further statistical studies in the Ministry and of the wide-ranging consultations which have been held, the Government hasevolved its freight policy in greater detail.    This Paperdescribes the proposals on which the forthcoming legislation willbe based.3.     As the 1966 V/hlte Paper showed, rail freight traffic has declined over the years, mainly because of a large and continuousreduction in coal traffic, although this trend was offset between1963 and 1965 by the railways&apos;   share of growth in the trafficgenerated by the steel Industry during that period.    By contrast,road transport has been growing fast with the rapid growth in theindustries that are big users of road transport.    In 1966 the fallm rail ton-mileage was resumed primarily because, in addition to-the continued decline in coal traffic, there was a sharp fall in steel traffic.  (See Appendix l).    Although the use of road transportincreased less last year than in previous years, it is clear thatthere is going to be a further rapid rise in demand as soon as industrial&apos;Cmnd. 3057
production picks up again.    The Government recognises that the flexibility which road transport offers means that this sectormust continue to play a vital, ana indeed a dominant, role, in theservice which the transport industry provides to the community.Because of the changes that are taking place in the type of service which industry needs, the dependence on road transport is increasingand will continue to increase.    But the growing pressure on roadspace, together with technological changes in the railwaysthemselves, emphasise the importance of making the fullesteconomic use of the railways where, in their modernised form,they can give ?.n efficient service and can save road space andcongestion costs.1.     The drive to cut costs and increase efficiency throughout industry has accelerated the trend towards handling and movinggoods in larger units.   &quot;&apos;ith through transport becoming the keyto efficiency and economy, the importance of container  service for non-bulk goods is growing rapidly.     ;&quot;ith the steady expansionof freightliner services during the past year British kail isadapting itself to play its full part in these developments.Similarly, new regulations to increase the maximum permittedlength of articulated goods vehicles, to be laid before parliamentshortly, are designed to help them carry containers of the largestinternational standard size mere safely.    Containers enable thetransport of goods to be treated as one integrated movement from origin to destination, net only by road raid, rail for domestic traffic, but alse by road/rail, sop, ana even air,internationally.    The full impact of the introduction ofcontainer operations has not yet been felt;    this will happen inthe early 1970s.    On the short sea routes to Pur ope there isalso the alternative of roll-on/roll-off services.    These toonre expanding;    and in the longer term the building of the
Channel Tunnel would also affect the pattern of movement of the growing trade between the United Kingdom and durope.5,     These technical developments highlight the need to ensurethat wasteful competition and duplication within the pub!idly-owned transport system are eliminated.    Rood and rail services which perform the same function must be integrated to improve their efficiency, -and those which should be complementary must operate ina framework which encourages co-orbd nation;    The road haulage industry must be freed from the outdated restrictions of the licensing system under which it operates;    but it must at the sametime reorganise itself to meet the challenge cf the higher standards which, the ration sow demands of it.     Similarly,the commercial and social aspects of the- railways&apos;   obligationsmust be clearly differentiated, ana the White Paper on Railwayi-policy-&apos; ,  jus t - published, shows how this is to be achieved.6. :   The trend of traffic away from the railways at a time whenthey are adapting themselves to handle it more efficiently, theneed for a new framework within which road and rail transportcan work together ana the simultaneous introduction of new conceptsand techniques for the through handling of freight, in which thereis a clear role for both road and rail, all point to the vitalimportance of integrated planning of the total transport system.Such planning must embrace all the processes in the transport chain:shipping, docks, inland transport and air services.    The nationally-owned road/rail services are a vital link in this chain.They must be reorganised to take full advantage of the new techniques for handling freight and to meet the challenge of thecontainer age.The Objectives of Freight Policy7.     Thus within this broad field the Government has set itself3.;Cmhd. 311.39
objectives: -to offer the customer a more efficient freight service in the public sector - including a comprehensive,efficient and more economic door-to-door road/railservice, facilitating and exploiting the use ofcontainers;to.eliminate wasteful and. inefficient competition between publicly-owned rone and rail services for thesame traffic;to use existing road and roil assets and manpowermore efficiently through the reorganisation ofstructure ana management and the adoption of new techniques and other improvements in productivity, aswell as through the co-ordination&apos;of new investment;to make the maximum economic use of our railways aswell as our roads by promoting the transfer of allsuitable traffic from congested roads on to therailways;    and at the same time to make available to industry generally the full benefits of the newfreightliner system;to improve the safety and efficiency of road haulageby means of a modern and effective system of carrierlicensing and a revised and improved control ofdrivers&apos; hours of work;    and . .to secure the willing cooperation of transport workersin these developments by associating them more closely with managements at all levels.
Th-n Form of In^rajtion8.     One way of securing the integration of the publicly-ownedtransport services would be to set up a new national transportauthority to which both the railways and the rationalised sector of the road haulage industry would bo responsible.      There are,however, grave objections to this.     In the first place, as theIntroduction to the 1 966 White Paper pointed out, the problems of integration in the freight field are quite different from those for passenger transport, where the needs of the customer demanda more individual service and where, therefore, regional andlocal considerations necessarily play a greater party   in con-sequence the solutions the Government is proposing are different,too.9.     Second, it will be apparent from the report of the JointSteering Group an; exed to the white Paper on Rail./ay Policy that very substantial problems over a wide field of its activitieswill demand the full attention of the Railways Board in the nextfew years.     These tasks will be urgent, exacting and over and above those arising from the integration needed in the freightfield.     If a national transport commission were to beestablished, with authority over the whole freight field, it would,whether it was given the direct responsibility for the operationof services or not, have to divide its energies between solvingthese railway problems and planning the organisational structureneeded to provide the most efficient freight service in thevarious fields where road/rail integration was required.10.   Moreover, a new authority would take some time to find itsfeet and to work out a scheme for reorganisation.      In doing so itwould inevitably go over much of the ground already covered by theGovernment with the help of outside experts.     At a time when theneed is urgent for reorganisation of our inland transport system to meet the coming challenge of co; tainer operations, valuabletime would in fact be lost.-5-
11,   The lesson of the British Transport Commission between19i4.7 and. 1962 was not that the concept of integration was wrongbat that a body of that size and range of responsibilitiesfound it difficult in practice to get to grips with the basicproblems of reorganisation to achieve road/rail integration.The Government intends that the publicly-owned freight servicesshall operate on strictly commercial lines.    But,  if this isto be done, and be seen to be clone, it is important that thevarious freight activities should be broken down for operatingpurposes into units which make functional sense and which can beheld financially accountable fer^the work that they do.    Only inthis way will it be possible to cost their work precisely andopenly, to eliminate undesirable cross-subsidisation and to achieve real economies by integrating like with like.12.    The nature and degree of the integration required between road and rail must vary accordingly to the type of business.    Insome types of freight activity - removals, for example - there is little or no rail element.    In others,  such as the parcelsservice or the liner train services,  there are obviousadvantages to be gained by integrating road and rail.    The first step, therefore, must be to differentiate the specialised freightactivities so that reorganisation can be carried out in ameaningful way.    It is equally urgent to do this on the roodside as on the rail.II:     Trie NATIONAL FREIGHT corporation the Field of Responsibility13.    It is for these  reasons that the Government believes thata separate and distinct body is needed to integrate thepublicly-owned freight services.    The forthcoming legislation willprovide for a new National Freight Corporation, which is to be a free-standing corporation responsible to the Minister.    its first task will be the further rationalisation of the functionalgroupings of the Transport holding Company&apos;s freight activities
as a precursor to integration with the corresponding railactivities where this would be sensible.    To this end it willtake over from the THC all its general and specialist road haulage services, together with its shipping services.    It willtake over from 3K3 the assets - depots, vehicles, warehouses,containers and other equipment (but not the trains).- employedin the freightliner and sundries services, and the BR3&apos;s othercartage vehicles.    This will enable it to take responsibilityfor all the movements which originate by road leaving the 3RBresponsible for both the marketing and operation of freight traffic - full train loads, company trains and wagon-loadtraffic - originating by rail and moving wholly within the railsystem.Id,    In this way integration will be concentrated on the areas where it will be most productive: general merchandise and parcelsand suneries.    These are the fields where rationalisation of road and rail services is most urgent if the railways deficit is to bereduced. In 1966 the BRB lost . 25nu on itssundries traffic and,  in preparation for the. legislative changes which it is hoped that Parliament will approve, 3RS and IHCare already engaged in discussions to bring the sundries serviceof the BRl and the parcels service of the THC together underunified direction so as to produce an expanding, efficient andmore economical service.    The Joint Planning Organisation whichthey have created,  in consultation with the trade unions, willin due course be incorporated within the health.15.    The BRB is also incurring a heavy deficit in the handling of general merchandise -  36m.  in 1966.    Here the basic need isto reorganise old-fashioned methods.    The carriage of unsuitabletraffic by rail must be eliminated and better methods must be developed of collecting, bulking ana distributing both
consignments of wagon-load size and those traffics whichpresent themselves in smaller quantities.    These are the trafficswhich incur most of the losses.    An important element in thisreorganisation will be the provision by the HE!C of a modern and efficient through service from door to door, using road forcollection and delivery, with traffic grouped at the terminalsfor trunk movement in bulk by rail,  thus exploiting to the full the new rail freightliner services for the carriage of traffic in containers.15.   The Transport holding Company has been conspicuouslysuccessful in tackling the problems of handling general merchandiseand parcels traffic of this kind.   At the same time the .853 hasbeen developing the imaginative freightliner concept as the most efficient method of trunk haulage for a wide range of merchandise.The combination in one organisation of the THC&apos;s experienceof traffic collection ana distribution and the be&apos;s freightlinerconcept will pave the way for a vigorous new service tc industry,commerce and the public^   Using &quot;both the THC&apos;s- vehicles and the BRBf scartage fleet to best advantage the flexMLity and door-to-do or facility of rcadnhaulage will be combined with the speed and economy of rail over long distances.The Arrangements for the Frcthtliner Service17.   The key to this road/rail development will be a FreightlinerCompany which, as a subsidiary of the NFC, will have the commercialresponsibility for the marketing and management of the freightlinerservices.    Transfer of this responsibility to the NFC is essential in order to enable the Corporation to make the most efficient[find economic use of road or rail for the trunk haul.    However,since the railways wi 11 still have a direct interest In thedevelopment of the freightliner service, as an important meansattracting a substantial volume of trunk haulage to rail, and.In order to ensure that both organisations have a clear incentive to develop the service to the maximum economic extent, the 8.
legislation will provide for the British Railways Board to havea substantial,  inter6st&apos; in&quot;this. Preightlirer &apos; ..    .&apos;    a company, consisting of a US% shareholding and an appropriatenumber of seats on the Board.    The Board will be appointed bythe Board of the health, the Railways Board nominating the 3RBmembers.18.   The Freightliner Company will have commercial freedom in determining its charging ^policy.    It will normally employ a standard charging system available to all but will be free inthe usual way to incorporate discounts for quantity, regularity,etc.   As well as selling through ser ices direct to the consignorit will offer a transport advisory and contract service to industry.    It will also sell space on the freight liners toother hauliers.    The freightliner terminals will continue to beopen to the private haulier and to the own-account operator without discrimination either as to the charges levied or the services provided.19.   The aim ef the Company will be to exploit the fullpotentialities of the freightliner.    Through its stake in theCompany the BR3 will be associated with the formulation ofpolicy for the conduct and development of the service.    tlointownership will not only facilitate joint working between the 3R3and the NFC, and the free exchange of information between them,but will enable them to work more closely together on planning and investment.    This will be important because the decisions onthe mode of transport in which investment is to take place will beexpected to take account not only of the a ta tut cry financial dutywhich each undertaking will have, but also of the need to sendfreight by rail where it is economic to do so.    This will be reflected in the statutory duty which the NFC will have to make
the maximum economic use of rail.    The two undertakings willbe expected to invest in new freightliner services wherever thereturn on capital to them jointly would be better than if the investment were not made and the traffic continued to gothroughout by road.    The Railways Board will levy a charge for providing and hauling the trains, which will be negotiated on acommercial basis, &quot;since the Railways Board will have a financialduty to break even and must, therefore, in relation to the freight liner services as elsewhere,  cover its long-termavoidable costs and secure an adequate contribution towards itsindirect costs,  including track costs.    In addition, profit madeby the Freightliner Company will be divided between the BRB andthe NIC in proportion to their shareholdings in the Company.20.    These arrangements will give the two undertakings a strongincentive to invest in the freightliner network to the maximumeconomic extent, and, once the investment has been made, to makethe fullest use of the service.    It will pay both undertakings to fill the train.The Structure of the RFC21.   The role of the RFC Board will be to set the framework withinwhich its various subsidiaries will operate, rather than to manage them.   Freight transport is not a single, indivisibleindustry:    its numerous parts vary enormously.    Flexibility isI therefore essential, and the new Board will be given the task ofI devising the structure most appropriate to its many sidedI activities.    Its duty will be to expand vigorously as a commercial3 enterprise and it will seek every opportunity, as the TEC has done,I to acquire new businesses by voluntary agreement and to Integratethem with its functional subsidiaries.    The Board of the RFCwill pay particular attention,  over the.whole field of its activities,  to financial matters, the selection of management and10.
its performance, conditions of service of all the staff andindustrial relations generally, and public relations.    Therewill be coordinating machinery within the NFC to ensure thatcommon policies are followed on these matters and that the subsidiary units do not act against each other&apos;s interests, andso that of the NFC as a whole.    There will also be arrangementsnt national level to permit co-ordination with, other operatorsend the provision of central marketing services for the largestinuustri al us e rs .22,   For these purposes a small, non-executive Board is requiredto plan the overall strategy of the undertaking ana to co-ordinatthe policies of the subsidiaries.    Its composition, and the subsistructure of the NFC, will reflect the Government1 s aim ofsecuring closer association of the xvorkers with the processes ofgoverning and organising undertakings of this kind.    The most effective ways of doing this are matters for discussion betweenthe RFC and the trade unions concerned.23,   In this way the NFC will be developed to provide a comprehensive, country-wide, road/rail service in conjunctionwith 3R3, with links to Ireland and Europe, by both containerand roll-on/ roll-off service.    On the deep sea routes, too, newcontainer ships are coming into service with cargoconcentrated for through transport with minimum handling.The NFC will develop road and rail inland transport links toserve these ships and the new and expanding network of inlandclearance depots,  in which the RFC will have a stake.Hnancial^ Targets2k.   The IF;, will have a financial duty, similar to that givento other nationalised industries, of at least oreaking even,taking one year with another, after making proper charges to revenue, including proper provision for depreciation or renewal of assets.    Specific targets will be set for the NFC on the
IHlines set out by the Government in its recent White Paper&quot;Nationalised Industries:    A Review of Economic and financial objectives&quot; .* The road haulage and shipping activities taken over from thTHO and the freightliner services taken over from the 3RB willbe operated on a commercial basis from the start and are expectedto make a positive contribution to the Corporation&apos;s overallfinanci al re sult s .25.   But there is one area where it will be Impossible for theWD &quot;to break even in the early years.    This is the sundries service which the Corporation will take over from the BR3.    The railways board already have in hand a major reorganisation of this trafficincluding the rationalisation of depots, the trunk haul of sometraffic by freightliner, and the transfer of some traffics to roadthroughout where this is more economic.    This reorganisation isexpected substantially to re duce last year&apos; s  25m. deficit on sundriesbefore the NFC takes the service over, and it will then be theresponsibility of the NFC by further rationalisation, higher productivity, and in due course by integrating the service withthat of 3RS Parcels Ltd., to eliminate the loss altogether.It will inevitably take some years for the NFC to achieve thisend.   In the meantime continued assistance will have to be given&amp;y the exchequer, at least in the early years, to meet- this loss.26i   It is therefore proposed that,  subject to an overall limit to be imposed by the Transport Bill, the NFC should be given a grant in respect of the full loss on this sundries service, as estimated annually in advance, in each of the first three yearsafter Vesting Day, two-thirds of the estimated loss in the fourthyear and one-third in the fifth year.    On this basis the NEC would have to finance an increasing part of any loss on the sundriesI service in its fourth and fifth years, and any losses thereafter,; from  its profitable activities and from accumulated profits.I 12.j :;Cmnd. 3^37
The effect would be to concentrate Exchequer assistance on theperiod when it is most needed and subsequently to provide themaximum incentive to eliminate the remaining and probably mostintractable element of the loss.The Transfer Arrangements27.   On Vesting Day, for which the target date is 1st January, 1969,the NFC will formally take over responsibilities  ty for the servicesdescribed in paragraph 13 and the assets and staff to run them from the THC and the BEB.    But before then much will need to-be done, and stild more pan be done.Interim Measures28.   In furtherance of the undertaking in paragraph 96 of lastyear&apos;s White Paper, that an early start would be made oncoordination, the BEB and the THC at the beginning of 1967 setup a Joint Parcels Organisation which has already led to closerinter-working between be Parcels Limited and the new SundriesDivision which the 3S3 have set up.   Under the aegis of this organisation close and continuous cooperation has been institutedat all levels throughout the two services.    In&apos;the J.P.O.there is joint consideration of investment, tariff harmonisation,inter-working arrangements, conditions of carriage, vehicle andequipment standardisation, administrative matters,  includingdocumentation and procedure, and training.    Close liaison has alsobeen established between the J.P.O. and the transport tradeunions.    In addition, the THC and the BEB have recently set upa Joint Freight Organisation to promote closer inter-working inthe general merchandise field, i.e. between the THC&apos;s road haulagecompanies and the BEB&apos;s freightliner and wagon-load businesses.Arrangements for closer coordination in the shipping field are^so being put in train.13.
29.   ...11 this will provide a solid foundation from which todevelop the rationalisation of services after, and also, in sofar as the 1962 Transport act permits, in advance of Vesting Day.The establishment by the BRB of the Sundries Division enables the relevant staff and assets to be clearly identified.      In due course, the Division will be converted into a subsidiary com anyof the BRB under powers to be s right in the Transport Bill, sothat control of the staff and as,.ets can be transferred simplyand without delay to the NEC on Vesting Day.      Similar action will be needed in the case   )f the freightliner staff and assetsso that the NFC can achieve a smooth take-over and start to operate efficiently straight ?way.Subsequent reorganisation  satisfaction on30.   dven so, the reorganisation and rationalisation which isalready going on in the sundries service, and the expansion ofthe freightliner service, will still be under way on Vesting Day.For this reason, and in particular to allow the NFC further timeto reorganise the various companies which it will inherit, sothat it can provide an integrated   attern of services in line with the principles set out in paragraph 21 above, it will benecessary to make provision in the Transport Bill both for theNFC to be able to reorganise itseown structure, subject wherethe change is substantial to the consent of the Minister ofTransport;    and also for the BRB and NFC to transfer staff andassets between them or their subsidiaries, again subject to theMinister&apos;s consent.      The Minister will also have power, subjectto affirmative resolution of Parliament, to make ordersre-allocating functions between the BRB and the NFC.14.
III:     THE FREIGHT INTEGRATIQi? COUNCIL31.   In order to assist the Minister of Transport to promoteintegration over the whole freight field, a Freight Integration council will be established by statute.    this will be a small body consisting of the Chairman of 3RB, the Chairman of the NEC,two representatives of the trade unions representing road and rail workers and two Independent members, under an independent chairman.    The independent members will be people of standing who can bring relevant specialised knowledge to the Council&apos;s tasks.The Council will have a secretariat of its own provided and paid for by the Ministry of Transport.32.   The Council&apos;s primary function will be to review and toreport to the Minister periodically, or at her specific request,on the application in practice of the policy and arrangements forfreight integration described in this White Paper.    This will be particularly important during a period when the network of nationalised freight services will be undergoing extensivereorganisation ana development.    The Council will also supplement the arrangements already described for coordination between the   BRBana the NFC, particularly in the investment fie Id c The F&quot;0I.C. will seek to find generally acceptable solutions to issues on which the two under-takings have failed to reach agreement,,  whore It also fails it willbe able to refer the matter to the Minister with its advice0    Inaddition the Council will be able to propose measures that it considers would promote the inte.; ration of freight transport inthe public sector.    It would also examine any matters concerning freight integration referred to it by the Chairmanof any of the other nationalised transport undertakings.    TheMinister will meet the Council to discuss its reports andrecommendations, or any ether matters of common concern, as appropriate.15.l-jj Lo e-^; l\C j
The Minister&apos;s powers 33.   The existence of the P.I.C. will not affect the Minister&apos;spowers in relation to the BP.3 and the NFC, which will follow thenormal pattern for nationalised industries in relation to suchmatters as investment and finance.    However, in addition to those powers and the power to give the Boards directions of a general character in relation to matters which appear to her to affectthe national interest,  the Minister proposes to take powers togive specific directions to the NFC and the BRB on matters which appear to her to require such directions and which arise fromrecommendations made to her by the F.I.C.   Powers similar in formalready exist in relation to matters reported to the Minister bythe Transport Users Consultative Committees.3k.   The transfer to the NFC of the sundries services, and ofthe commercial responsibility for freight liners, will still leave the Railways Board with the great bulk of their presentfreight traffic, that is, with some 2,00m o   tons a year on the oasisof the 1966 figures.    A substantial part of this business isalready moving economically in full train loads on through runs, but som120m. tons passes in smaller units of one or more wagon loads and much of this is unremunerative, mainly because of the extensiveand   costly     marshalling and shunting which is necessary en route.   This very substantial proportion of the BRB&apos;s trafficpresents a major challenge tc the railways.    It must be reorganised and rationalised to ensure that it travels in themost economic way, and this must be a Railways Boardresponsibility.    Some will be better converted into full or parttrain loads;    some should be transferred to the   freight liners;and some would move more efficiently by road throughout.IV:   . THE ROLF OF THE RdRAILWAYS
Even when as much as possible of the wagon-load traffic has beenreorganised in these ways there will still be a substantial volume of business which will continue to pass in consignments of wagon-load size and, for this, the Railways Board willreorganise and rationalise their service so as to improveand simplify the pattern of&quot; movement.    Because it will assume responsibility for the traffic which would go most economicallyby freightliner or by road throughout, the RFC will be closely associated with the Railways Board in working out the new arrangements for wagon load traffic.
SECRETV:    ROAD HAULAGECarrier Licensing;IIntroducjbinny.t    If road and rail are to play their proper roles in the nationalheight plan, and so to meet the transport needs of industry to thefullest extent, radical changes are needed in the system of carrierlicensing.     In last year&apos; s White Paper the Government accepted theliew of the Geddes Committee &apos; that the present licensing system was inlany respects wasteful, ineffective and unduly complicated, hut held that instead of abolishing licensing altogether it was necessary to devise afiew system which would he an effective instrument of a modern nationalfreight policy     The Government also considered that decisions on changes in the licensing system should await further Ministry researchIinto the relative costs of carrying goods &quot;by road and rail,jjlo.    The Ministry&apos; s. research into trunk route transport costs,  the main purpose of which is to obtain information on the likely returns from roadEnd rail investment arising from alternative transport polioie s, is a continuing operation of which the first stage is now nearingfoaplction.   Although several major questions are still being studied,the research has already provided valuable guidance&apos; on four specificproblems relevant to road transport policy.   An intensive study of roadtrack costs is now complete,  the main conclusions of which form the background against which the Government proposes to introduce the newcharges for heavy goods vehicles described in paragraphs 67 and 68.Hie study will be published in the Ministry&apos;s coming report on trackcasts.   An assessment has also been made of the spare rail capacityon routes where significant quantities of traffic now move by roadinch would be suitable for carriage by rail.    Thirdly, the relativejjosts of container movement by road and rail have been fully examined,IPth particular regard to the distance at which rail transport becomesaore economic   than road, and the factors which affect this break-evenI Point.   Lastly, the freight forecasts produced in the course of thissearch have enabled detailed estimates to be made of the inter-urban141 eight flows which will be suitable for freightliner operation.rriers&apos; Licensing - Report of the Committee, 1965.
IZIn the light of this research the Government considers that thenew system of carrier licensing which is now proposed should contain-orovision for promoting the fullest economic use of rail where this can be done without imposing additional costs on industry.37.   The present licensing system, which was set up by the Road and rail Traffic Act,  1933* was designed to regulate competition withinthe road haulage industry,  in view of the depressed conditions arisinfrom rapid unregulated expansion;    to give some protection to therailways by allowing them to object, along with other road hauliers,to the grant of licences to public haulage operators;    and to protect the safety of the public and of the drivers by providing sanctions against operators of unsafe lorries.      But the system no longereffectively achieves these objectives, and the objectives themselvesneed to be reconsidered in the light of modern needs.38.   Regulation of competition between public hauliers is no longer necessary.      The Government fully accepts the conclusions of the geddes Committee in this respect.      Road transport is still an expanding industry, but it is incomparably stronger and more vigorousthan it was in the 1930s and is likely to remain so.      There is noreason to suppose that the road transport industry cannot now standon its own feet without the need to regulate the amount of availablelhaulage capacity.      In any case,  the present licensing system hasturned out to be largely ineffective in controlling total road haulagjcapacity and imposes an unnecessary administrative burden on much ofthe industry.39.   For the reasons already mentioned,  the need to give some protec-tion to the railways is still a valid objective of licensing.      TheGovernment believes that the principal means by which the railways&quot;ill secure a larger share of the available traffic will be byimprovements in their services and the greater effectiveness that&quot;o-ordination with the N.F.C. will give.     The first of these changes/is
is already taking place.     New techniques&apos;- the freightliner, thecompany train - and hard selling are already capturing traffic fast.But there is a long way to go before the railways have the trafficfor which they are fitted.     Meanwhile there is spare capacity on therailways and congestion on many roads.      It is,  therefore, plaincommon sense to keep some form of quantity licensing as one of themeans of encouraging industry to use rail transport where it can get a service which in overall terms of speed, reliability and cost is atleast as good as that which road transport can provide.      It is truethat the Geddes Committee doubted the value of licensing as a meansofpromoting greater use of rail.      But the Committee could not take account of the new and improved services, particularly the freight-liner, now being introduced on the railways.     Although these newservices will attract much traffic of themselves,  an additionalincentive which only licensing can give is needed to encourageindustry to use them to the full.LO,   The protection of public safety by the promotion of high standards of vehicle operation and maintenance is even more importantnow than it was in 1933.      Roads are more crowded,  vehicles more powerful and the incentives which can lead to breaches of the law for financial gain remain.     Yet the existing system gives little scopeto licensing authorities to inquire into the suitability andcompetence of intending operators, and the disciplinary powersavailable to deal with operators who break the law have provedI quite inadequate.Mi.   finally,  the present system is far too diffuse and extends to anlurmecessarily large range of vehicles.     Of the 1,500,000 vehicles nov.I authorised under A,  B or C licences, over half are under 30 cwt.h licensing is concentrated only on the larger vehicles it willI become far more effective in achieving its objectives, and at the-same time a large number of light vehicles will be freed altogetherrom an out-of-date and unnecessary control./TheI - 20 -Hdd-aw p.- SECRET
h.2.   The Government therefore proposes to introduce a new carrierlicensing system adapted to present day needs,  the main features ofwhich are:-(a)    the complete exemption from any form of carrier licensing of goods vehicles not exceeding 30 cwt. unladen weighty(la)    a system of quality licensing applicable to all goods vehicles over 30 cwt.  and designed to improve road safety;(c)    a system of quantity licensing limited to goods vehiclesover 16 tons gross weight,  and designed to promote thefullest economic use of rail transport, where suitableservices are available.Exemption of vehicles not exceeding 50 cwt. unladen weightU3.   There are over 900,000 goods vehicles not exceeding 30 cwt.which are at present subject to carrier licensing.      They are nearlyail operated on own account, and are mostly light delivery vans andtradesmen&apos;s vehicles used for local runs only.      There are no economic grounds for subjecting them to licensing.      Also, most ofthese vehicles are operated in towns and the accidents in which theyare involved tend to be less serious than those involving heaviervehicles;    the number of deaths from accidents per vehicle mile iskefi higher for lorries over 30 cwt. than for those of 30 cwt. and below.     Moreover, vehicles Lip to 30 cwt. will still be subject tothe same annual tests as private cars and also at any *time to roadsidespot checks by Ministry of Transport examiners.      It is proposed,therefore, to exempt vehicles not exceeding 30 cwt.  from carrierlicensing altogether, and to concentrate the new system on theoOO,000 heavier goods vehicles.Quality licensingkk.  Whatever developments take place in rail transport, road haulageW1;ll continue to play a dominant and expanding role in the movement ofipeight0      One of the principal aims of Government policy,  therefore,- /is to21   -
is to promote the highest possible standards of safety and working conditions in the industry     To this end the Government proposes tointroduce a new type of carrier&apos;s licence to he held by everyoperator of goods vehicles over 30 cwt. - the so-called 11 quality&quot;licenceo     To receive such a licence an applicant will have tosatisfy the licensing authority that:(a) he can and will provide or secure adequate maintenancefacilities for his vehicles, keep proper control over their loading and arrange satisfactory checks on thehours worked by his drivers;(b) his financial resources are commensurate with his proposedscale of operation and,  in appropriate cases,  that he hassufficient business in prospect to maintain reasonablefinancial stability;(c) he holds a new type of personal licence (a &quot;transportmanager&apos;s licence&quot;), issued by the licensing authority,and entitling him to manage the vehicles of a transportundertaking, or employs the holder of such a licence in aposition of responsibility.The licensing authority will also take into account the applicant&apos;spast record,  if any,  of vehicle operation.,^5.   The rights of existing carriers to object to the grant of a licence to a public haulier will be replaced by a new right ofobjection designed to bring to the notice of the licensing authorityany relevant facts which he ought to know when considering anapplication^     The right will be exercisable by trade unionsrepresenting workers in the road goods transport industry, byemployers1  associations representing operators of goods vehicles, by*,e Police and by certain local authorities.     They will be able tootdect on the grounds that the applicant could not satisfactorily^ the criteria which the licensing authority must consider beforegranting a licence,- 22 -/The
The licensing authorities will have wide discretion in applyingthese new tests.     The past record in the industry of most existingoperators will he such that they can he granted a licence with theminimum of investigation,,      Equally there will he some who can expect the most searching enquiries to he made0     All new entrants to the industry will similarly have to undergo close scrutiny-Licensing authorities will refuse a licence to anyone who cannotmeasure up to the new standards, hut in cases where there is realdoubt or uncertainty about an applicant (and this will of necessityapply to many newcomers to the industry who have no past operatingrecord) the licensing authority will be able to grant a short-termlicence for a year or so to give the applicant time to prove himself.Otherwise licences will normally be granted for a full term of fiveyears.kl.   An important new feature of the system will be the individuallicensing of the person responsible in each undertaking for theday-to-day management and maintenance of the vehicle fleet.      Insmaller concerns this will often be the owner himself, or one of thepartners, but for larger fleets there v/ill be a separate transport&quot;anager for these functions.      In the very large undertakings, withmultiple operating centres,  there will usually be a transport manager&quot;for each depot or group of depots.     In deciding how many licenceiholders must be employed by each operator, regard v/ill be had to thesay in which individual firms are organised,  the size of theirvehicle depots and the places where they are situated.It is the ultimate aim that applicants for a transport manager&apos;slicence should have to produce evidence of their professionalcompetence by passing appropriate examinations,  and discussions as to how progress might be made towards this objective will be started;ith all interested organisations.      Once a system of examinations isla force the Government hopes to be able to hand over theMinistration of transport managers&apos;  licensing to a separateProfessional body organised and supported by the industry itself.- n7 /The new
lq(   The new system will provide strong disciplinary powers againsta defaulting operator.      First, whenever there has &quot;been a breach ofthe law relating to vehicle operation,  the licensing authority willbe required to consider suspending or removing from the qualitylicence one or more of the operator&apos;s   lorries, orsuspending or revoking the licence altogether.      In considering thisquestion the licensing authority will also take into account any previous breaches of the law relating to vehicle operation committed by the operator.      In serious cases of mismanagement the position ofthe holder of the transport manager&apos; s licence in the organisationcould &quot;be called in question;    his own licence would be at risk unless he could show that he was not responsible.5O0   There will be a right of appeal to the Minister for operatorsand transport managers who are refused a licence or whose licences:?3revoked or suspended by the licensing authority, and also for objectors who are dissatisfied with the licensing authorities&apos;decisions on operators&apos;  licences.Quantity licensing,51,   There is a considerable amount of traffic which travels over the longer distances by road.      Appendix 1 shows that road transport onhauls over 100 miles amounts to some 16,000 million ton-miles,  or about 1+0% of road ton-mileage.      It also shows that a substantialplume of bulk traffic - coal,  iron and steel,  and some extractedpaterials - moves by road both for the longer and the shorter distances^jpinistry of Transport studies have indicated that some q,500m. ton-piiles of traffic of a kind now moving by road could go by rail in the-early 1970s, rising to some 6,000m. ton-miles by 1980.     AlthoughMOBm. ton-miles would be only some 10% of road ton-mileage itpresents an increase of about one third in rail ton-mileage.      Its on the long distance general merchandise traffic and on the bulktraffic now moving by road that quantity licensing needs to be?Qncentrated in order to promote the fullest economic use of rail./The Government2k
&quot;SECRET78:c52,   The Government is therefore proposing to limit quantitativeontrol over road haulage to all goods vehicles of more than 16 tonsotoss weight engaged in hauls of over 100 miles, or in the carriage ofcertain specified bulk materials such as coal, various extractedmaterials,  and iron and steel (mainly in the unfinished and semi-finished categories) over both long and short distances.,      Own-accountvehicles above the same gross weight will be included in the newquantity control.53s   At present some 190,000 public haulage vehicles of all sizesare subject to quantity control.      But the present form of quantity(control, based on proof of need,  is ineffective.,      The newcontrol Will apply only to the L0,000 publickulage vehicles which are over 16 tons     gross weight,(and/Will bring in an additional 60,000 own-account vehicles above that weight.     In practice, some of the 160,000 lorries over 16 tonswill be engaged exclusively in carrying on journeys of less thanIflO miles goods other than the prescribed bulk commodities.      Theselorries will not he affected by quantity control.jjlj.,   A limit of 16 tons gross weight (which is approximatelyEquivalent to 5 tons unladen weight) has been chosen because lorries&quot;over this weight carry about half the tonnage and account for half theton-mileage moving by road over 100 miles,  and thus carry much of the traffic which will be suitable for the freightliner service.      Theyplso carry much of the bulk traffic moving over all distances.(fhe 100 mile limit will apply to the distance over which any individualconsignments are carried;    vehicles will not be restricted to journeyspthin 160 miles radius of a given operating base.15&apos; Goods vehicles under 16 tons will be exempt from all quantitycontrol and will be free to undertake any kind of work.     Althoughlicensing authority will impose a limit on the number of vehiclesfuthorised in an operator&apos; s quality licence, this limit will reflectim the operator&apos;s capacity to maintain a fleet of given size./For
For vehicles both below and above 16 tons the old distinctionbetween carria e lor hire and re ard and carriage on own accountsill disappear, except in those few cases where a licensing authoritydecides to restrict a licence to own account operation because he considers that the applicants reco d does not justify extension ofhis activities to include carria - e for hire or reward, or that suchextension would overstrain his resources ior maintaining his Vehicles56. ;\n application for a quantity licence    ill be made (as under thepresent system) to one of the independent licensing authorities.Ihe operator will have to state, in so f r -s  it is practicable to doso, the type of goods he intends to carry and the areas within whichor between   hich he intends to. operate.    The licensing authority will send a copy of the application to the National freight corporation (It eight liner Company) and the -British railways Bo rd.If will be    pen to objection only by one or other (or both)    of theseteo bodies.    If the traffic in question can be carried by freightlinethe potential objector will be the freightliner Company;    if it cank carried 6the wise by rail, the potential objector will be theB.H.B.     Objections will be made to the licensing authority anda copy will go to the applicant,    there is reason to think thatarrangements similar to the present informal road/rail neg.otia.uina&quot;achingry will continue in being, and so minimise the number of&quot;objections that need to be heard by the licensing, authorities.&quot; licence will be issued automatically if there is no objection.5h The sole basis for an objection to the issue of a quantitylicence will be that rail or the combined road/rail service offered,0y the N.F.C. can provide a service which overall is as satisfactorythat 0* the applicant; taking into account a combination of speedlability and cost in relation to the needs of the consignors and nature pi the particular traffics concerned.    (Cost in this/ conne ction
Connection will mean cost to the consignor.)     The test will,iLrefore, he on an economic basis;    it is not the Governmentsention that the licensing system should be capable of being useda means of diverting traffic to rail  uneconomically*     Infiort, the system is designed to promote carriage of the traffic bylil where this can be done without detriment to the consignor.,6, An objector will have to give supporting reasons for hisInjection.      If, in the licensing authority&apos;s opinion,  a prima facieIse has not been made out, he will have power to dismiss theRjection without a hearing and grant a licence to the applicant.1fa prima facie case has been made out,  the licensing authority111, as under the present system, hold a public inquiry.59, At this inquiry the licensing authority will call for evidencerora applicant and objector relevant to a comparison between the-proposed service and the rail alternative in terms of the criterion(i speed,  reliability and cost described above, and each side will be[Jole to develop  its&quot;    case orally before him.      The applicant will bele to refer to the relevant rates and time schedules of Britishil or the N. F. C &apos; s Freight liner Company which will be introduced inevidence at the hearing and which will be a matter of fact.      Thejector, on the other hand, will only have,  in the case of anplication by an own-account operator,  the applicant&apos;s own assessmentthe speed, reliability and cost to him of operating his own transportgjpieet his own needs.   It would bo unreasonable to place on the objector thip of proving that this assessment was inaccurate.      Moreover,  theIpernment considers that if, when all the evidence has been producedjti examined,  the licensing authority finds that neither the applicant&apos;?Fse nor that of the objector is conclusive, the need to ensureIpinaam economic use of rail transport should tip the balance towardse objector.     At this stage,  therefore,  the onus of proof must rest-the applicant.      At the conclusion of the inquiry the licensing/authority27SlCi aPf
authority will grant a licence,  subject to appropriate conditions,only if, and to the extent that, he is satisfied that rail doesnot provide a service which is as satisfactory as that of the appli-eant in terms of speed,  reliability and cost.60o   In considering contested applications, licensing authorities,111 be able to draw upon detailed information provided by thecurrent Ministry research into the relative costs of carrying goodsby road or by rail.     They will also be empowered to call upon expert advice, e,g. on accountancy, from independent assessors.      special provision will be made by means of short-term or emergency licences to ensure that the system is sufficiently flexible to avoid inter-ference with urgent and unexpected demands for the movement of goods which cannot be met by rail or by the use of vehicles under 16 tons0There will also be provision for appeals by applicants and objectorsto an independent tribunal against the decisions of licensing1 author it ie s .6lo  Apart from rights of appeal, both applicants and objectors willhave safeguards in cases where a licence has been granted or refusedon the basis of evidence or undertakings which  arc   not borne out by subsequent events,      The safeguard for an applicant who has been; refused a licence will   be that he can  . reapply,  with obviously[enhanced chances of success,  if the railways&apos;  services proves to be&quot;significantly inferior,  or their charges significant^ greater,J than he has been led to expect.      In the reverse case, it will   be*open to the railways to send the necessary evidence to a licensing authority who .. can   then,  at his discretion, call on the licencepolder to show cause why his licence should not be revokedc      TheRational Freight Corporation will be required to apply for quantity-cences in the same way as a private haulier,  although it will inaact have a statutory duty to make the maximum economic use of rail0? the trunk haul.      Licensing authorities will have discretion to&apos;eiuire the N,IhC.  to produce evidence in support of an application/for a28f
gor a quantity licence to show why the traffic in question could, notps carried by rail 0Ig2,   These arrangements,  in the Government &apos;:s view,  overcome the1 difficulties envisaged, by the Geddes Committee of using the licensing system to influence the distribution of traffic betweenIfoad and rail.     The argument has been frequently heard,  since theGovernment V/s proposals were first published in July,  that the normal;orces of competition are sufficient to ensure that all traffic which[is suitable for rail will go there without any need for additional[pressures from licensing.      The Government believes that, in the longI run, rail will secure its proper share of the available trafficprimarily by improvements in the type and efficiency of the servicesIit offers a       At the same time, there&apos;will often be a naturalreluctance by consignors to alter their habitual arrangements for thetransport of their goods, unless the advantage of the rail alternative is obvious and substantial.      Inertia and habit will play their partmd some consignors may not even be aware of the advantage to them ofthe new rail services, nor of the true economic cost of their present arrangements.     The arrangements now proposed, which are firmly basedIon the principle that licences will be withheld only when rail islive rail as satisfactory as road,  will also have value in encouragingI some consignors to make a conscious comparison between the actualcosts to them of road and rail trunk haul in relation to differentpasses of traffic.      Nevertheless,  the Government intends to befsatisfied. that the new freightliner service has proved Itself inpractice before quantity licensing is introduced.      It is therefore proposed that the Minister, of Transport should be given powers in thetransport Bill to bring the system Into force by Order on anpointed day, when she is satisfied that the freightliner servicesp?e developed sufficiently to justify its introduction./Transitional29
^gnsitional arrangementsgji.  The present system of A, B and C licensing will remain in foroeuntil quantity licensing is introduced.      It will run in parallelfor some time with the proposed system of quality licences whichwill he introduced as soon as possible after the Transport Billbecomes law.     After the appointed day when quantity licensing is introduced,  operators of vehicles over 16 tons gross weight whichare used for purposes requiring quantity licences will have to apply for them when their existing A, B or C licences expire.     Anoperator may surrender his A,  B or C licence after the appointed day, hut before it will normally be due for renewal, and apply for a quantity licence if he wishes to do so.     Otherwise, existinglicences will normally be allowed to run their full term.      But a five year licence issued in 1968 would run until 1973,  and the system could not be brought fully in force within a reasonable period if all existing licences remained valid until they expired.     TheGovernment therefore intends to take powers to limit the duration&apos;,of licences current when quantity licensing is Introduced, if thisshould prove necessary in order to confine the period of transitionwithin reasonable limits.      In exercising these powers,  licensing authorities will be entitled to take into account any hardshipj&quot;which might result by allowing reasonable time for readjustmentito the new licensing system.Drivers&apos; - Hours^. The legal limits on the working hours of professional driversisve played an important part in protecting public safety since they;fcre introduced in 1930.      The tired driver can be a menace to110self and to others,  and without the safeguard of realistic limits)n his hours the professional driver is prone, not only to tiredness&apos;0wards the end of the day, but also to a cumulative build-up of&apos;atigue which can be especially dangerous.     The present limits:ave remained unchanged for 33 years.     Yet traffic conditions to-day-re very different.     Following widespread consultations withrePresentatives of vehicle operators, workers in the industry and/other
other interested organisations, major changes in the milesgoverning drivers&apos; hours will he included in the forthcomingTransport 3ill.    Details of the proposals as they relate to goods vehicles are contained in Appendix 2.Abnormal loads charge65.   Most motorists have suffered from the frustration and delay caused by slow-moving heavy lorries with abnormal oroverhanging loads.    Police time is Involved in providingescorts, and despite careful routeing the congestion causedis often considerableo    In some cases the loads might have beensent by sea or rail, or broken clown into smaller units.    Inother cases the nature of the load or Its destinationprecludes the use of alternatives to road transport.66.   The Government believes that the introduction of a specialcharge for the movement of such loads will encourage consignorsto look for other ways of moving them.    It will also give somecompensation to the public for the social bests imposed by theremaining abnormal loads which must continue to move by road?It is therefore proposed to include in the forthcoming Transport3ill provision for payment of a specific charge by operators of vehicles carrying abnormal loads.    The charge will be assessed on a mileage basis and its amount will also vary according to the dimensions and weight of the abnormal load,from one shilling a mile for a load only just within the abnormal category to as much as  15 a mile for the very largestand heaviest type of load*    It will be collected by the offices of the licensing authorities.31Ca Ira i?rB       !F*
Road Haulage Charge67o   Lorries impose heavy wear and tear on road surfaces.   As aresult, roads have to be built to higher constructional standardsthan would otherwise be necessary, or maintenance has to-becarried out more frequently.    In general, the heavier the lorry,the greater the cost in providing roads adequate to its needs.Ministry research into track costs, the report on which isbeing published, has shown the high proportion of road maintenance and construction costs that is attributable to heavy goods vehicles.    Other European countries have recognisedthis fact in the charges they are proposing to apply to the useof heavier lorries (see Appendix 3)*68.   The Government has therefore decided that, in addition tothe contributions that all vehicles already make to generalrevenue, operators of goods vehicles over 3 tons unladen weight should, pay a specific charge per vehicle which willreflect the extra costs imposed on the road.s by heavy goods vehicles.   The charge will be collected by the Ministry ofTransport and will be separate from the vehicle excise duty.It will be an annual charge at a rate rising with vehicle sizefrom  50 and up to a maximum of  190 a year for vehiclesover 8 tons unladen weight.    This proposal must be viewedagainst the background that the Government is committed toa continuing programme of heavy expenditure on roads.32
VI:    THE WATERWAYSIn    In certain parts of the country commercial traffic on the inland waterways is still playing a small hut nevertheless usefulip*rt in the transport of freight, particularly of &quot;bulk commodities,,L foreshadowed in Chapter VIII of the 1966 White Paper thosenationally-owned waterways which could form an economic transportundertaking will, with their allied transport facilities such as(docks and warehouses, be operated by the British Waterways Board ona commercial basis and,  with a more realistic capital structure, wilbe separately accounted for.     These commercial waterways have nowbeen listed in Appendix A of the recent white Paper on BritishWaterwaysT     Every effort will be made to promote and develop the[transport uses of these waterways wherever this is economically[justifiable .VII:    COASTAL SHIPPING70,   In terms of ton-mileage, coastal shipping carried 16% of all(freight movements in 1966 compared with 22% by the railways.Coastal shipping is particularly suitable for moving bulk commodities-ties where the producing and consuming centres are both on or neartidal water or the broader inland waterways.     About 85% of all[coastal cargo has hitherto consisted of coal and oil,  and a numberof large and more efficient ships are being built for these trades,which are making a significant contribution to reducing costs.      Thetonnage of coal continues to decline,  as the country&apos; s fuel needsj change, but the industry has shown enterprise by developing newI trades such as gravel dredging and supplying the North Sea oil rigs.(Specialised ships have also been built for moving heavy and bulkyjloads which would ctherwise congest the roads.More than 30% of dry cargo and 50% of the oil carried coast-Use by sea is carried in British ships.      Many of these ships alsocarry exports and imports in the short sea trade and therebycontribute directly to the balance of payments.     The Government^cognises the contribution which coastal shipping can make to thenational transport system./Coastal;Cmnd. 3hoi 331SECRET
j2.   Coastal shipping is included in the scope of the Committee of inquiry which the Government has set up under the Chairmanship ofLord Rochdale to review the efficiency and competitiveness of theshipping industry.    The Government will give close attention toany recommendations about coastal shipping the Committee may make.VIII:    AIR FREIGHT73.   As explained in last year&apos;s White Paper air freight is a somewhat specialised (and domestically comparatively small)traffic.    International air freight is, however, of very great and growing importance, especially for high value,  compact or fragilegoods,  or those needing very quick: delivery.    In 1966 nearly 550m. worth (or over 10%) of U.K. exports or re-exports were carried by air.    The freight traffic of British scheduledairlines grew on average by 23% a year from i960 to 1966, which waswell above the world average growth.    Further rapid growth isexpected in future, with the introduction of the larger jet aircraft with improved freight capacity and of freight aircraft with improved economics.    The use of containers and pallets,standardised handling equipment and other techniques to minimisehandling and permit through services, together with an increasedawareness among exporters, agents and consignees of the benefits of air freight, will all play their part.    Accordingly it is clearly-iijgv&apos; -&apos;&apos; jgg;important that there should be close liaison and co-operationbetween the N.F.C. and the  operators, agencies and authorities concerned with providing air as well as shipping transport.Through services, and the appropriate links between surface andair facilities (including those between inland clearance depotsand airports) must be developed.    Similarly all reasonablestandardisation, interchange and co-operation must be encouraged.
The Edwards Inquiry set up recently by the Government to review the civil aviation industry will be making recommendationsnits Report, which is expected next Spring, affecting,  among other things, the inter-relation between air and surface transport in the U.K.   Freight services will no doubt be given due attention&apos;oy the Committee in its study.IX:     THE TORTS75,   The changes in the techniques for handling and transportingfreight call for radical adaptation of the facilities in our ports.On the one hand there is the extension of bulk-handling to newcommodities and the continuous growth in the size of bulk carriers;on the other, the growth of the through unit load concept forgeneral cargo - both roll-on/roll-off services, in the main forthe short-sea trades, and the newer standard container servicesusing specially developed cellular ships.    Modernising our ports and adapting them to the new techniques calls for massive capital investment.    Port investment has already risen from an average of 18m. a year in the period up to 196k to  35m. in 1966 and anexpected  h5m. this year;    it is expected to continue at at leastthis level for the next few years.    The programme will be keptflexible to match the speed of technological advance.76.   The full benefit of modernisation of the ports will only beobtained if the planning and operation of their facilities are closelyintegrated with both Inland transport and shipping.    The Governmentis improving road access to the ports, and the freight liners will serve all our main freight ports.    But the new unit load systems, andparticularly the use of containers, can be exploited to the full onlyh loading and unloading can be carried out as near as possible to the origin and destination of the goods and if traffic can be concentratedto provide large regular flows handled by far fewer vehicles, berthsfind ships than conventional cargoes require.    These factors have led/to the35.
0 the current development of inland depots in the main industrialentres for the loading and unloading of containers and theirJf ranee through Customs.      The Government welcomes the developmentf these depots, which are &quot;being provided jointly by private andaoiic enterprise,  through consortia which include the containerhip operators,  the B.R.B.,   the T.H.C.  and in some cases the portuthorities,  and other inland transport interests, because theduced handling and reduced transport of small loads to the dockshould lead to the lowering of transport costs for a large proportionfour exports and imports.&apos;, These plans for modernisation to meet changing circumstances arenly a first,  though essential,  step in the provision of a modern,fficient ports system.      In the longer term,  as outlined in the 1966&quot;bite Paper,  the Government intends to introduce legislation for theeorganisation of the ports on the basis of public ownership.      Tobtain the fullest benefits from the integrated through movement ofreight unified control of our ports is essential. ^   The need is forstrong central directing body with power both to prepare plans and0 ensure that they are carried out, whilsc being itself chargedith the full responsibility for its policies.      The Governments^visional proposals for a National Ports Authority, with Regionaloft Authorities under it, were circulated to the many interestsoncerned, as a basis for discussion,  in early July;    their commentsill be thoroughly considered before final decisions are taken.PRODUCTIVITY AMD EFFICIENCY7 In transport more than in most industries there are problems instaining high standards of productivity.      The great variety ofi0pk and the difficult and changing conditions in which transportPerates, particularly in towns, make especially e xacting demands onf^gementa     But, even more important,  transport is a labour-Stensive industry.      It will,  therefore, be vital to ensure the/closest
losest co-operation between management and workers in the developmentf new methods of working and the use of better equipment0      Improve-snts in productivity are needed not only to provide better andheaper transport services, but also to provide the resources forproving conditions for transport workers.     It is the Government&apos; sntention that steady progress should be made with the rationalisationf conditions of service for the staff of the various undertakingsransferred to the National Freight Corporation so that staff engagedn similar duties enjoy comparable pay and conditions.      But the pacewhich standards generally can be improved must depend on the ratet which it is possible to improve productivity.5, Then again,  in the port industry,  although some time will beeeded for the initial problems to be solved,  decasualisation haseen a major step towards modernising the conditions of employment.A the way will now be open for a wider extension of productivitygreements designed to increase throughput and reduce costs by the ore efficient use of new machinery and methods.0, If these technical developments, with their important implications-ions for the workers concerned, are to be vigorously pursued,  it isssential that the workers in these industries should have a muchloser association with management.     The exact forms of consultationJyvary from one sector to another but the key principle is that them and women involved should discuss, not merely the &quot;how&quot; but the*/&apos; of the changes they are asked to accept.     Consultation mustWore embrace, not merely negotiation of terms and conditions ofaPloyment, or measures affecting the safety, health and welfare of*ers, but also proposals to improve efficiency in all its aspects,4 the workers&apos;  representatives must be given the informationpessary for them to be able to participate effectively in suchHussions - as provided in the Iron and Steel Act,  1967.      In theainS Transport Bill,  therefore,  a duty will be laid on the B,R.B05and B.W.B.  to consult the unions with a view to setting up the/necessary
lessary machinery and to report to the Minister, within a periodpecified hy the Minister,  on the progress made.     Consultationsre already being held on the application of these principles to lie port industry as part of the coming reorganisation,,
XI t   MdNfOf 5E,      Appendix 1 gives an estimate of how the road transport industry will continue to grow.    Moreover, whilst the stimulus to the greater use of rail from the proposals in this white paper will be vital to the future prosperity of railways, theamount of traffic likely to transfer from road to rail throughthe combined influence of the quantity licensing system and theexpansion of the freightliner network is likely to amount onlyto about one third of the growth otherwise expected in roadfreight ton-mileage.    Consequently, the trend of manpower in road transport will be little affected.82,   But railways and docks present a more difficult problem.The serious decline in many traditional rail traffics, and the increasing use of containers for general merchandise traffic,for instance, will clearly have very big effects on the demand formanpower on the railways and, iia the latter case, in the docks.Although the problems that will arise are primarily for theindustries concerned to resolve, it is the Government&apos;responsibility to ensure that those who are employed in these industries do not live in continual uncertainty about the future.* close watch will be. kept on trends in manpower and each industry will be required to produce a manpower budget.    In the case ofthe railways the outcome of the discussions taking place on pay and efficiency and on productivity null have to be taken intoaccount as well as the effects of changes in traffics and of technological improvements.     Firm estimates of long-termmanpower requirements must await accurate assessment of these developments.    In the case of the docks the Government lias, withthe help of the National Ports Council,  the National Docks labour board, the port authorities, the employers and the shipping industry, undertaken a preliminary study of the trends over theflcxt few years of demand for and supply of both registered
jockers and other port workers;    a broad assessment of theposition over the next five years should be available shortly.The Government will work with those employed in both industries in the task of preparing plans for the future and in particular on the arrangements for any necessary redundancy and retraining.It will pay particular attention to regional or localdifficulties as they arise.5CII; Leo- M-.CK83.  Research is of fundamental importance if full advantageis to be taken of the application of the latest techniques oftransport;  communication and control and if new techniques are tobe developed which permit cheaper and more efficient ways of handling and moving freight..   Much valuable work is going on in both the public and private sectoss of the transport industry.For example, the 3R3&apos;s Research Department is currentlyinvestigating, among: other things, the further mechanisation of-freight handling, the dynamics of vehicles so as to improve theirriding behaviour (and to avoid derailments) and the development of higher speed freight vehicles-which need less maintenance.    Theirlonger term work on the development of an advanced passengertrain and en automatic train control based on track-to-traincommunication will also benefit their future freight operations.To ensure continuous and balanced technological developmentacross the whole transport spectrum greater emphasis must be puton speculative research for the longer-term.    The nationalisedtransport undertakings - have an important responsibility in thisfespect and it is accordingly proposed that the forthcominglegislation shoul 1 impose upon the BRB, BTDB/BWB, tons and the NFG -a-Clsarauty to promote research and development.    At the same time rrangements have been made between the Ministers of Transport?-no. Technology for a joint transport research and developmentho.
 pgr same, using resources from both departments.    The Nationalesearch Development Corporation, the Atomic &quot;Jnergy Authority and ii 33B are co-operating closely in these arrangements, with theJong-terra aim of stimulating the development of new transport;ysteras and equipment to meet the future demands of both passengersnd freight.    Furthermore,  to ensure that research is notunreasonably constrained, the minister of Mransport proposes to[take specific powers to give financial assistance for thejroaotion of transport research and development.4.  ,.s the 1966   kite Paper indicated, the Ministry is alsoarrying out a substantial economic research programme with thejeneral aim of providing a firmer economic basis to guide-acisions on transport policy.    Reference has already been made in para. 36 to the contribution which the first stage of the Inter-Wan Transport Costs Model has already made in the field ofcarrier licensing.    There have,  in audition, been valuable by-jroducts, in contributions to current policy matters.    For example,the research has played a useful part in the consideration of the justification for further railway electrification.    It has alsoteen used in estimating the effect on road haulage costs of changesin drivers&apos; hours, and of higher vehicle speeds.      ork on theIrons port Costs Model is being extended to include an examinationof the significance of coastal shipping, air freight and pipelinesfor road and rail transport.    Other research has been useful inpeasaring trie labour intensity of the road, haulage industry,  asH^;t of a wider investigation into changes in the industry&apos;s costs.&quot;5. -mother major economic research project within the Ministry^ concerned with the impact of containers on the flows of importsan&apos;- exports.

mathematical model of port hinterlands has been developed to improve forecasts of the port facilities required for general cargo which is not suitable for carriage in containers. The Ministry has also commissioned a study on the practicability of a pallett pool for U.N. domestic and, if possible, international freight traffic, and on its potential value. The total amount of research work in the field of transport economics - both by the staff of the Ministry of Transport and by outside organisations on its behalf - is far greater than ever before and is still increasing. A substantial part of this research will, moreover, be reaching fruition during the next few months. The Government will continue to foster this work.

XIII: CONCLUSION

The demand for transport is an ever-growing one and the industry must be dynamic. In fact its performance over the different sectors has been uneven. An industry which contributes over 10 per cent of the country&apos;s gross national product and employs some 9 per cent of its labour force is bound to have many and varied problems. But the Government is determined that a better service shall be provided to the nation, and is convinced that the way to achieve this is by a more rational and better co-ordinated use of the available resources. The proposals outlined in this White Paper involve substantial changes in the organisation of the public sector, and a new challenge to the road haulage industry. But they are flexible enough to permit account to be taken of increased knowledge, changes in demand and technological developments. They are an essential stage in the process of preparing the transport industry to meet both the present and the future needs of the community.

aenent trends2.    The earlier trends continued in 19.66 hut with a smaller growthinroad transport, and an apparent slight fall in total ton-mileage by all modes.    This year, on the figures available to date,it appears still to be declining as a result of the interruptionin the rise of industrial production and the continuing fall in coal traffic.Table 2 Inland freight transport ton-mileagestrends and sharesdeTOW MILSS (thousand million)19621963196419651966% SHARE1962196319641965196611pinglinendrways33.616.110.80.40.^&apos;35.015.410.60.50.139.016.110.70.70.141.015.410.90.80.141.514.810.60.90.1552618157251715924161602316i6122161al61.1&apos;.1.666.668.21001001001001003.    The share of road transport has been growing and that of railfalling mainly because of the growth in activities that are largeusers of road transport in contrast to the considerable fall in coaltraffic and the modest growth in iron and steel traffic.    As Table 3indicates, the bulk fuel and steel traffics account for some 85 percent of the total freight tonnage and 70 per cent of the ton-mileagemoving by rail./Table 343

Inpse of coal, total ton-mileage will be sharply reduced as theffimn /rasultpres subject to re-check
ailing demand coupled with a shorter average length of haul dueIely to the siting directly on coalfields of coal-fired power stationsently under construction.    Although demand for oil and steel will the demand for transport of these commodities will not keep pace,substitution of natural for oil-based gas, the loss of other marketsatural gas, and factors connected with the location of new refineriesall affect ton-mileage.    Nuclear power will make only minimal demands[transport.   With steel the continuing change-over from home to importedlocational changes, concentration of production and a progressivelotion in the tonnage of imports required per ton of steel produced,all tend to reduce the transport ton-mileage required per ton ofd.  Present indications are that the aggregate transport ton-mileagedel and steel traffics could fall from 28,000m. ton-miles into some 24,000m.&quot;in 1975.[Thus total transport demand in 1975 would be as follows:-Thousand millionton milesi 1966 1975Fuel and steel 28 24Other 40 52[Total Jj^ 76[es in 1Q75Rail carryings of fuel and steel traffic will probably fall from&apos;00m. ton-miles in 1966 to some 8,000m. in 1975.

Its share of total ton-miloage would remain at 22 per cent as in 1966.i) road transport ton-mileage would increase by some 8,000m. ton-miles, or nearly 20 per cent.    Its share of total ton-mileagewould rise to 65 per cent.% road ton-mileage on hauls over 100 miles would still be rather higher than in 1966s    the transfer to rail envisaged would be rather more than offset by growth in tho remaining road traffics.h6
Drivers&apos;  HoursThe principal changes in the existing law on drivers&apos;  hourswhich will be Included in the Transport gill are as follows;-(a) The maximum permissible length of a driver&apos;s workingday will be reduced to 11 hours from the present totalof lk.    The new 11-hour limit will include an allowance of no more than 9 hours actually at the wheel of a vehicle, compared with the II hours out of the presentlk which a driver can spend at the wheel or working inconnection with his vehicle or its load.(b) The minimum daily rest period will go up from 10 to 11hours, and will have to be taken immediately beforestarting a day&apos;s work.(c) To combat the build-up of fatigue, a new limit of 60hours&apos;   total work in any week will be introduced,together with a new requirement for at least one 2h-hourrest period each week.2.    Measures will be taken to streamline the work of enforcingobservance of the law and to increase the effectiveness of theexaminers whose job this is.    All goods vehicles, except thelightest not exceeding 30 cwts. unladen weight will have to carryrecording instruments (tachographs) designed te give accurate and permanent recorcis of driving time and other information aboutvehicle operation.    Drivers will carry a. new personal log book forrecording their hours of work and rest, unless they are engagedsolely in driving the lightest vehicles.    Examiners&apos;  powers to scrutinise records relating: to driving and working time will be strengthened, and defects in the law which have made enforcementunnecessarily difficult in the past will be remedied.iiy,
I&apos;(  Drivers who have to drive only as an ancillary activityto seme other main occupation - for example the trade--man whouses a van to carry his tools from job to job, or theshopkeeper who spends an hour or two each day delivering orders to his customers - and who are not subject to the same dangersfrom driving fatigue as a full time driver will be released fromcomplaince with the law by a provision that anyone who drives forless than 4 hours each day in a week will no longer be reckoned as a driver for the purposes of these rules.Ij.,    A new and much-needed flexibility will be built into thelaw by allowing the minister of Transport to make suitable arrangements for those drivers whose job involves emergency work(for example in running fire or ambulance services or in keepingvital public utilities functioning)  to be excused from those parts of the rules which might otherwise make it impossible forsuch services to be provided.    And the Minister will have powerto allow some extension of the working day (though not of thenumber of hours of actual work within the day) in those fewinstances where this is essential to enable particular transport services to be run properly.5.    Reforms on this scale will call for a big effort frommanagement and unions within the industry to ensure that they canbe carried through without major increases in operating costs and without undue hardship to drivers.    Increased productivity whoe the key factor and evidence of real progress towards this objective by both sides of the industry will be essentialbefore it is possible to bring the new lav/ fully into effect.-48.
h9Road Haulage charges the Government&apos;s proposal    to introduce a new road haulagecharge as a contribution to the wear and tear on roads caused by heavy lorries is in line with the systems in operation orproposed in Germany and Prance.2      Germany has long had a ton-mileage charge as well as thenormal excise tax based on vehicle weights,,      It is now proposedthat the ton-mileage charge should be substantially increased forvehicles carrying goods on own account, rising from about  250at 3 tons unladen weight to  1,500 at 8 tons unladen weight.3,     In France there is also an excise tax based on vehicle weights.An entirely new charge is now proposed which is linked directly with the weight of the vehicle and the load it transmits to theroad through each axle.    The new charges will vary from about  50per annum for lorries of 5 tons unladen weight to about  500 perannum for those of 8 tons unladen weight.
