OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF KER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C(67) 17814th November, 1967CABINETBRITISH EUROPEAN API7 ABC RE-EC. UIPMENTL-Icmoraadum by the Minister of TeclmolonyOn the facts set out in the paper by officials (Append!::-to C(67) 176),I believe that the BAC 2-11 should be rejected on two grounds - its cost,and the fact that it runs counter to our aircraft industry policy.2,      When launching costs are taken into account, the national cost ofa BAC 2-11 fleet for British European Airways (BEA) is likely to be dearerthan the possible alternatives by some  40 million or more (discounted);this means appreciably higher Exchequer expenditure during the next fiveyears.3,        While, if all went well, the BAC 2-11 v/ould undoubtedly commandsome export sales, particularly among airlines who are satisfied users of the BAC 1-11, these sales would probably not be large;  the greaterpart of the Governments investment in launching the aircraft would almost certainly be lost.4.      If large civil aircraft projects are to prove worthwhileinvestments, we must in future undertake them in collaboration with other countries, so as to widen the market and spread theR&amp;D costs.    This was the foundation of our recent decision onthe Airbus.     The BAC 2-11, which could not be started on the basisof a wide assured European market and shared R Si D, would eat intoAirbus sales and v/ould also rule out the possibility of starting duringthe next few years another collaborative project which could form, withthe Airbus, the beginnings of a European family of civil aircraft.     Thisis the only way open to us in the future of combating American - and perhaps Russian - competition, of continuing to earn worthwhile amounts of foreign currency, and of assuring the position of Rolls-Royce in the longer term in the big engine field.     To further this policy, I shallshortly be putting proposals to the Treasury for starting exploratorywork at BAC on the design of an advanced 200-seat aircraft which couldform the basis for a joint project to complement the Airbus.5.       The BAC 2-11 could only be justified if we decide here and now that our European civil aircraft procurement policy is going to fail.This policy remains a valid one even if we do not enter e.c. at thepresent time;  as a step towards merging British and Europeantechnological resources, it should improve our chances of entrylater.-1-copy NO.    fij)GO N F 3 D 2 N Tl At
6      If we decide against the BAC 2-11, BEA&apos;s best British buy wouldbe the Trident 33.    In terms of operating costs for BEA, it should beas good as the Boeing 727/200, the aircraft which BEA originally wanted to buy.    It v/ould form a logical extension of their present Trident fleet,and is a useful intermediate size between present types and the Airbus.BEA estimate that their earnings during the next ten years would be slightly lower with the Trident 3B than with the Boeing 727/200, but thedifference is less than 2 per cent, which is within the margin of error ofthe calculations.7,      BEA need a decision urgently.    Both BAC and Hawker Siddeleyhave been keeping open our option by continuing design work on the bac 2-11 and Trident 3B at their own expense.     They will not continueto do so.    We must therefore take a decision now, otherwise wc may ultimately find ourselves forced into buying Amierican.8.      I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that if BEA re-equipment is to go beyond their existing types, it should be on the basis of the Trident3B.A.W.B.ministry of Technology, 5.77.1,13th November, 1967
BRITISH EUROPEAN AIRWAYS RE-EQUIPMENT-THE BAG 2-11Addendum to Memorandum by the Minister of technology the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) yesterday offered tocontribute 10 per cent towards the airframe launching costs of the bac 2-11 provided they receive an initial order from BEA for not les3than 20 aircraft.    On the formula they have adopted, this works out at about  7.5 million and reduces the estimated cost to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment for airframe and engine to some  120 million.    This isnot a ceiling figure, since BAC are not prepared to accept an upper limit to our 90 per cent contribution.    It does, however, include a contingency margin of  10 million and is probably a safe figure.2,      Rolls Royce had earlier offered to bear 30 per cent( 14 million) of the engine launching costs, with an upper limit to theGovernment contribution.    This followed the pattern of similar offersfrom them for the RB 207 in the European Airbus and the RB 211 forLockhead, and is taken into account in the project estimate of 120 million above.3.      The BAG offer (worth say  5 million in discounted terms) doesnot significantly affect the financial appraisal in earlier papers.    Thoughcoming at the last moment, it can perhaps be charitably regarded as amark of confidence by BAC in the project, but not a particularly big one;it falls far short of the 50 per cent which we normally expect an aircraft manufacturer to contribute towards launching costs.    E, inaccordance with what BAC believe is Government policy, we boughtthe company, their contribution converted into work-in-progress wouldbe purchased as part of the net assets of the undertaking, and they wouldargue that the fact that the BAC 2-11 is a going project enhances the valueof the undertaking as a whole.4.      The balance of argument is therefore still, in my view, againstthe BAC 2-11.A. W. B.Ministry of Technology, S. W.1,15th November, 1967
