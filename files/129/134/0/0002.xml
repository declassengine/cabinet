5 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT)C (67) 17231st October, 19675COPY NO.CABINErRESUMPTION OF DIPLOivlATIC RELATIONS WITHTHE UNITED ARAB republic memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs this memorandum sets out the reasons why I consider it desirablethat diplomatic relations should be resumed between the United Kingdomand the United Arab Republic (UAR).2, Whether we like it or not, the UAR is still the most influentialArab state. It is certain to remain so. Its attitude will be crucial toa satisfactory Middle East settlement and to the reopening of the suez canal, which is of primary importance to us. It cannot therefore bein our interests, or that of our friends, that we should be deprived of early and regular access at a high level to the UAR Government and hence of the opportunity to influence their policies.3.       Our resumption of relations with the UAR would have an effecton the Arab countries that broke with us in June.,    Iraq and Sudan wouldprobably soon follow in the UAR&apos;s footsteps.    Algeria might also do so,though the Syrians probably would not.    In all of these countries theUnited Kingdom has substantial material interests.4,       That it cannot be in our interests to be without relations withthe UAR is also true in a wider context than that of the Middle East:the UAR is a leading power among the non-aligned nations.    OtherAfrican countries which broke relations in December, 1965, overRhodesia, could also be influenced by the resumption of Anglo-UARrelations.    So long as we have no Embassy in Cairo we are denieduse of one of the most important posts for obtaining information aboutdevelopments in Africa and influencing their course.5.       There are in addition bilateral problems that can only be solvedif we maintain at least correct relations with the UAR.    In thisconnection Sir Harold BeeleyTs mission to Cairo has already producedone valuable result in that the UAR authorities have agreed to the resumption of military overflights between Aden and the United Kingdom.6.      Nor at this time should we ignore our capacity to influence for good events inside the UAR.     The war of the summer left the Egyptiansmore than ever dependent on the support of the Soviet Union,    One ofthe UAR Governments motives in making the first overtures for a resumption of relations (see paragraph 8 below) was certainly thatthey felt themselves in dangerous isolation from the West,     Our
resuming relations with them would do something to move them back in thedirection of non-alignment and would give encouragement to those Egyptianswho wish to resist the increasing penetration of Egypt by communist influence, to which Sir Harold Beeley has drawn my attention,7.      Since as a general proposition I consider it to be in our interests that we should have diplomatic relations with the UAR, I took steps lastyear to make it clear to the Egyptians that if they wanted to resume rela-tions with us they v/ould be knocking at an open door.    considerable progress had been made by the spring of this year.    Five of the african states, including the UAR, that still had no relations with us had agreedthat relations could be resumed on 1st July,    The June war then inter-intervened.8.       Once the immediate emotions engendered by the war had subsided,the Egyptians gave various indications that they would like to get on better terms with us.    For example, at the beginning of September theyrestored the British Overseas Airways Corporation^ staging rights at Cairo.    More significantly, the Editor of the Cairo daily Al-Ahram,who is close to President Nasser and certainly would not act withoutofficial approval, v/rote in the Sunday Times of 10th September that inhis view it was time for a dialogue to begin.   Meanwhile, PresidentNasser played the decisive part in the victory for moderate policiesat the Arab Summit Conference at Khartoum,9.      I decided that it would not be right to ignore these indicationsor to miss any chance of influencing President Nasser to maintain a moderate course, which may become increasingly difficult for him.I therefore sent a personal message to President Nasser proposing a resumption of diplomatic relations, and I agreed with the UAR ForeignMinister in New York on 23rd September that Sir Harold Beeley should visit Cairo.10.       On 21st October Sir Harold Beeley was able to reach agreementwith President Nasser that diplomatic relations at Ambassadorial levelshould be restored in the first half of December.    It was encouragingthat the UAR made no attempt to extract any concessions from us inreturn for this agreement, and that President Nasser in effect apologisedfor the lie about our collusion with the Israelis,11,       It was agreed that no announcement about our agreement shouldyet be made, since President Nasser said that he needed time to&quot;condition&quot; other Arab countries.12,       The UAR&apos;s economic condition is bad.    When relations arerestored we shall want to negotiate about the UAR&apos;s obligations to us,including the release of resequestrated property, compensation for nationalised property, commercial debts and the repayment of an export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) loan.    Even with good-will, the UAR will find it very difficult to repay us.    But it should bepossible at least to resume normal trading on the basis that we do not increase the UAR&apos;s net indebtedness to us.    Otherwise our commercialrivals will steal a march on us.
13.       Critics say that by rnakiijtg friends with Nasser now we are buildinghim up and encouraging him to be intransigent.    Alternatively they saythat he will not last long and we should be in no hurry to commit ourselves to him rather than to his successors whoever they may be.    I believe suchcriticisms to be misguided.    There was no connection whatever between sir Harold 33eeley&apos;s mission and the incidents of 21st and 24th October whenthe destroyer &quot;Eilat&quot; v/as sunk and Suez shelled.    We might, indeed, wellbe in a better position to prevent further incidents of this kind, if diplo-rnatic relations were resumed.    Sir Harold Beeley was not empoweredto, nor did he, negotiate on the broader issues of Arab/Israel problems.14.       Sir Harold Beeley found President Nasser fit and apparently infull control, though there must be doubts about his future in the longer term.    But whether or not President Nasser remains long in control doesnot, I think, affect the need for an early resumption of diplomatic relations.    The UAR will certainly remain influential in the arab world;  geography makes it crucial for the reopening of the Sues Canal.If President Nasser were to fall we would be in a better position to influence his successors if we had diplomatic relations.15.      Why resume diplomatic relations now?    In my view it isparticularly important now, when a settlement of the problems ofthe Middle East must in large part depend on the UAR&apos;s continuing the relatively moderate line it adopted at the Khartoum Summit, thatwe should be in a position to use our influence and to do some serioustalking with the Egyptians at the top level.    Our ability to play a worth-while part in the current efforts in the United Nations Security council will be enhanced by this.    Re-establishing diplomatic relations is not an anti-Israel gesture; indeed the Israelis cannot reasonably object toit when they themselves constantly say they want direct talks with theArabs including the Egyptians.     In fact, the recent sinking of the &quot;Eilat&quot;and the Israel retaliation at Suez point up the need for urgent progress towards a settlement, to which we can contribute far more effectivelyif we are talking to both sides,16.      A further point in favour of diplomatic relations now is the factthat our own withdrawal from South Arabia coincides with UAR withdrawal from Yemen, which removes a major area of contention between us.    the disappearance of these two problems, which have in the past obstructed any satisfactory relationship between ourselves and the UAR, will afford apossibility, which v/e should not let slip, of a real improvement in the atmosphere both bilaterally and in relation to Middle Eastern problemsas a whole.17.      Why relations at Ambassadorial level?    Why not just a Charge&quot;d&apos;Affaires?    The answer is that it is only at the highest level in the uar today that it is possible to influence thinking or get decisions.We have had a &quot;British Interests Section&quot; in Cairo for almost twoyears, and we still have one;  but although routine consular, commercial and other matters can be dealt with fairly well at this level, there is nosubstitute for an experienced Ambassador who can talk frankly to PresidentNasser if we are going to be able to help in solving Middle East problems and getting the Suez Canal open.
18,       I recommend that my colleagues endorse the policy of working forfriendly bilateral relations with the UAR and welcome the proposal to resume full diplomatic relations in the first half of December.G.3.Foreign Office, S.W.I.31st October, 1967
