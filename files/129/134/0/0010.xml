DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)0(671.180 COPY NO. jBJj^15jhJ^yember, 1967CABINETVIETNAMMemorandum bvjdie Secretary of Statefor .Fcgeign 5 urd r.&apos;sI attach at Annex a Memorandum setting out the history andbackground to the Vietnam conflict and the current attitudes of theprincipal participants^,    I invite my colleagues to consider our Vietnampolicy in the light of the essential facts as identified by this memorandum and of the alternatives open to us.The Essential Facts2.     The North Vietnamese are at present determined to fight on inSouth Vietnam to secure g-(a) a regime in Soutn Vietnam which is in all respects theircreature (i. e. the Liberation Front to take exclusive power);(b) the withdrawal of United States forces by attrition, that is bycreating a situation in which increasing popular frustrationin American and the movement of world opinion will compel the United States administration to break off the war!  or(c) alternatively, negotiations exclusively on their own terms whichwould secure the objectives in (a) and (b) above03.     The South Vietnamese and United States Governments, with theother Vietnam belligerents? have decided that the survival of the Southand its people in independence and safety requires armed resistance,with equal determination, to the attack from the North; and arepursuing a defensive war while constantly re-stating their readiness tonegotiate a solution which would leave South Vietnam in peace,,4.     Both sides in the conflict are deeply engaged in fighting a warwith geographic and political limitations.    The North Vietnamese areunable to mount a military effort in the South which would swing themilitary balance in their favour; and the United States are precludedby world opinion and the stresses of the presidential electoral campaignfrom all-out military escalations such as the land invasion of the Northor additional measures of air and sea warfare, aimed at bringing thewar to a swift military conclusion.-1-
5,     Each side is aware that there are channels for direct communica-tion with the other side.    These channels have been used, on a number of occasions j but have served only to establish for each side that there isno acceptable alternative to continuing the fighting until there is a changein the political or military situation,,    Both sides believe this cha.nge will come, to their own advantage, but until it does they are determined tocontinue fighting.6.     In this present situation there is nothing which we, or any other non-involved Government,- can do to mediate or to arrest or alterdevelopments.    But we have a duty and a capacity to maintain a continuedreadiness to act in the cav.Be of peace when asked to do so by one of thecombatants.7,     In the United States there is widespread concern over the conductand continuation of the war- and a public, debate in the classicalAmerican manner on what should be done to dispel this concern.  its essential components are frustration, war weariness and a desire to end the whole hivolvement in Vietnam,    But while probably a majoritycriticise the Administration^ handling of the war, the desire to be&quot;out;! in a way which v/culd hand over South Vietnam to the North,i. e. through an abdication of American responsibilitiess is held by onlya small - but vocal - minority.    An equally vocal minority is demandingall-out escalation as a means of finishing the war quickly.8,     Meanwhile the Communist powers are mobilising a skilful world-wide propaganda campaign, which they believe will work in north vietnam:s interests, to assert that while North Vietnam ?s owa intervention in South Vietnam is blameless, the military policies cf the United states are totally immoral    The majority of those concerned in the currentinternational wave of demonstrations against the Vietnam war are neither Communists nor fellow-travellers.    But the demonstrationsthemselves are being orchestrated principally by the World Council ofPeace (WCP), cue of the original Soviet Communist front organisations,which dates from 1948, and takes its cues from Moscow.    The WCPset out to stimulate demonstrations on 21st October (&quot;International PeaceDay on Vietnam&quot;) in Britain and the United States and other countries inEurope, Latin American and Asia,    Co-ordination was provided by a continuing Committee.1 set up by the International Conference on Vietnamwhich met in Stockholm in July this year.    For all practical purposes the WCPcontrolled and stage-managed the Conference, and stilleffectively runs the Continuing Committee1.     The WCPJs propagandaapparatus throughout the world was turned on to promoting and sub-sequently publicising the demonstrations on 21st October.    It is nowadvertising the Continuing Committeetst plans for the future, which include the celebration of 10th December as Human Rights Day, and20th December as the anniversary of the foundation of the national liberation Front of South Vietnam.
j. 5 J.The Three Alternatives9.     We have three alternative policies which we could adopt;-(a) We could align ourselves unswervingly behind the UnitedStates Administration to the point of uncriticial supportat all times.(b) We could express public criticism of the American position,ranging from complete dissociation to a demand for the bombing to stop,, in the hope that this would advance theprospect of a negotiated settlement.(c) We could recognise that there is nothing we can do for thepresent, but meanwhile maintain our capacity to giveprivate advice to the Americans and to maintain contact with other powers, against the day when both sides mightwant our services.I review each alternative in turn.Course (a)?  Unreserved support10.     Uncriticial alignment behind the Americans would be an act offolly.    We would reduce our ability to play an independent role else-where, as well as in the Vietnam context;  we would destroy our ability to offer advice and to criticise in private; above all this would be to actagainst the weight of British public opinion including that sector whichbelieves that the Americans are in the wrong situation even if theirmotives are rightoCourse (b); Disapproval11,     If we believe that the South Vietnamese have the right to resista takeover, we cannot condemn the Americans for helping them.    in considering what action we could take, the critical point is whetheraction by us will lead directly to a decent settlement of the problem.Any step recognised as the sine qua non of a decent settlement will inthe long run be excused, if not applauded.    But the same step, if itfails to produce a decent settlement may be vilified and regarded asthe cause of subseqtient disasters; and here we must accept that ourdissociation or disapproval would not bring North Vietnam to negotiations.    Furthermore the Americans themselves and the world in general would regard public criticism, by Her Majesty*s government at the present time as synonymous with condemnation; and this wouldalso place us in one sector of the domestic turmoil in America,    Bydoing this we would lose the confidence and respect of the present andfuture Administrations there; and by estranging ourselves from thepresent Administration - on whom falls the burden of deciding on aVietnam policy adjusted to domestic requirements and the military andpolitical situation - wo would damage perhaps h-reparably our under-standing with the United States in other fields and areas of the wo?Id.
12.     In these circumstances there is a strong probability that thepresent Administration and any likely successor in 1968 would, to say the least, cease to exert themselves at all in favour of British interests.Whether it is a question of protectionism against British goods, defencecontracts, refraining from discrimination against our imports to thevitally important United States market, trade with Rhodesia or votes atthe United Nations on Gibraltar, there would be a strong urge to punishour alleged &quot;defection&quot;, and we need not expect any effective sympathyfrom United States pressure groups or Congress.    There would undoubtedly be adverse effects for us both in practical terms and interms of the overall political success of our policies.    In prosperoustimes these might not be much more than marginal considerations.Iam more concerned over two deeper considerations.    One is our balance of payments and the other is the balance of power.13.   If after all that has happened we now take an anti-American lineon Vietnam, it is hard to believe that the United States administration will take a helpful line in respect of our financial, economic and commercial problems, and it is impossible to suppose that theContinentals will - or indeed can - provide an adequate substitute for american help.    A.nd it is not merely our balance of payments problemnarrowly defined that is at stake.    Our application to join the e.c. andour chances of solving the offset problems are both willy-nilly bound up with the international financial situation and our bargaining strength in it.14,     The world balance of power its also at stake.    Personally, I donot believe that America is likely to become consciously isolationist.But there is undoubtedly a risk that if she thinks she is defeated in vietnam, and particularly if she thinks that this result has been broughtabout by her principal allies, she will follow a sporadic and unpredictableforeign policy, withdrawing here and over-asserting herself there.    Thiswould be a dangerous situation.    We could not be sure that the Chinese and Russians would properly interpret American actions and wouldresist unwise temptations.15.    Finally, at a time when our own power has declined we shouldnot lightly resign such influence as we have and can have with the most powerful nation in the world,,    Apart from anything else, a loss of influence with the Americans automatically entails a loss of influence with others, including, particularly, the Russians.    (The relationship with Britain has a certain special interest for the Soviet Governmentprecisely because what we say is taken seriously by the Americans. )Countries very seriously affected by such a change would be our commonwealth partners, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and singapore.    If we lose influence with the Americans we lose influence with them.    It will be worse still if they believe we have contributed toan American defeat in Asia. pjj-lg,e (c)s The middle course16.     The policy I believe to be right is to avoid involvement at the wrong time (for us) but yet to retain (for us) the capacity to talk to the americans frankly and to the other powers involved from a position ofdisinterest except in the overriding objective of a negotiated settlement.This policy would avoid ranging ourselves on the side of those who have-4-
hitherto offered no reasonable alternative to a cessation of militaryactivities by the one power which can prevent South Vietnam beinghanded over to the rule of force.    Equally it would continue to secure for us a position from which we can act when any of the parties engaged inthe war believe that eur services could help towards a settlement.    this time has not yet come.    The North Vietnamese do not need us.    TheSoviet Government frankly take the view that the Geneva Co-Chairmenhave no role to play at the moment.    The South Vietnamese, thoughgaining in stature, are only gradually approaching the point where an initiative for direct North/South talks could add a new diplomaticdimension in the situation.    The Americans know that we are always readyto help with peace moves when these are practicable.The Moral Considerations17,    Over and above all the foregoing, there are the moral considera-tions in this conflict; and these are frequently misrepresented.    I haveno doubt that none of us wishes to see South Vietnam captured by theNorth and its inhabitants submerged in a totalitarian regime.    TheSouth Vietnamese have a right to freedom and a right to decide theirown future for themselves.    The result of a total American withdrawalnow would be immediate subjugation of the South because by ideology,training and adaptability to the local situation, the Noridi is infinitelybetter equipped to achieve this than the South is to resist it.    to capture the South has always been the Northfs objective since the 1954Geneva Agreements robbed them of military success.    For the UnitedStates to resist the takeover is no more to be condemned than was their leadership in resistance to armed attack in the Korean war.    the objectives of the Communist side are unchanged; to secure territory and peoples.    Only their methods are different and have therebybrought about a different type of intervention by the powers&apos; capable of organising resistance.    Moreover, as I have shown in the Annex, theAmerican help for South Vietnam has always been in clear response to an Escalation1 of the takeover-attempt; as the situation has developed in complexity, so has the measure of the United States1response to it.    If, however, we believe that the South have the rightto look to their friends for help, then the degree of help they have sought and secured cannot be a matter of criticism or condemnation.18.    To condemn the United States at present is to condemn the majorpower in the conflict which has publicly proclaimed a policy aimed at sercuring for the South Vietnamese the right to order their own affairs;and which hss reaffirmed constantly its readiness to negotiate a settle-ment which will achieve this end.     I do not believe my colleagues would have us condemn the continuous search for ways to end thefighting and start negotiations.    This is the American policy; but ithas foundered on the determination of the leaders in Hanoi to sit it out until the Americans, they hope, will be inescapably obliged tocomply with North Vietnamese requirements.19.    Nowhere is the Northts skilful use of the &apos;double standard1technique for distorting a moral issue clearer than in their campaign against the bombing.    While they themselves fight on in the Southwith every means at their disposal, including the most repulsiveatrocities, they have succeeded in mobilising a selective condemnationof one method of American warfare - bombing - which can play a significant part in both halves of Vietnam in checking the North-5-SECfSET
Vietnamese /Viet Cong effort.    Quite apart from the fact that acceptance of this thesis is to play the Communist game, I believe it ismorally indefensible to suggest that the bombing alone is to be condemned,with the implication that other forms of slaughter are in some waytolerable,20.    Furthermore, we are not fighting in Vietnam;   and therefore we are not qualified to pass judgment on individual methods of warfarethere, though we can deplore all use of force as a means to settle disputesOur right and duty of intervention is based on our responsibility for achieving peace.    It follows that, if we accept that the United States is justified in using force to help prevent the North Vietnamese forcibletake-over of the South, we cannot claim the right of military judgment on the utility of bombing North Vietnam as one instrument of this force.Nor can we insist on a cessation if, in the military judgment of thecombatant concerned - the United States - this would lead to militarydisadvantage and more casualties.    We can, however, argue for, and demand, a cessation of bombing if in our judgment this will succeed in achieving progress to a negotiated settlement, since this is our overallaim, and we have taken every opportunity (including my discussions with President Johnson and Mr. Rusk in September) privately to urge the Ameiicans to re-examine their bombing policy as carefully and asfrequently as possible.    They have declared their readiness to ceasebombing when the cessation will lead to talks.    At present it is the refusal of North Vietnam to meet the American readiness which is theobstacle to our own policy as well as to that of the United States,21.    Finally I think we should remember that the conflict looks very different in Asia than it does from the other side of the world.    the australians and New Zealanders believe it right to be fighting alongside the Americans; to pass moral judgment on the latter would be to judgeour Commonwealth partners as well.    It is a fact, too, that in none ofthe non-Communist Governments of South East Asia is there anoutspoken demand for the United States to quit with the Vietnam issueunresolved.   This holds good for South Vietnam itself, Burma,Thailand, Laos, Malaysia and Singapore&apos; I believe also for Indonesiadespite her middle-of-the-road public position.    Even Prince Sihanoukof Cambodia has reservations about an American withdrawal from Asia.Conclusion22.    In sum, I recommend to my colleagues that we should maintain,and if possible improve, our present policy of committed detachment;that we should view the present period of self-examination in the UnitedStates with sympathy and make it clear that we understand theirdilemma;   and that we should make our attachment to a peaceful settlement the foundation of our readiness to mediate if asked to do so.Above all I believe we should eschew a position of moral condemnationof the United States because it would not be based on valid moralprinciples; it would not shorten the war; and it would not be practical politics.G.B.Foreign Office, S.

The first American presence in Indo-China wasDstablished in 1951 with the formation of KAAG(Military Assistance Advisory Group) consisting of some200-300 men concerned with, supervising IT. S,. military aid to the French.    In 1954 this was reformed as an advisory Group to the South Vietnamese Government,3.     Prom 1954 to 1959 North Vietnam relied mainly ondiplomacy and propaganda to unite the whole of Vietnamunder Communist rule.    Communist sabotage and theassassination of officials continued at a low levelin the South.    However, in the middle of 1959 therewas a sharp increase both in the number and scale ofsuch incidents,  and evidence from captured documentsreveals that the movement in the South was being directed clandestinely by members of the Lao Dong party(North Vietnamese Communist Party).    Our evidence alsosuggests that infiltration of trained Insurgents fromthe North was running at a rate of more than 400 per month through 1959 and I960.4.     In September I960 at the third congress of the LaoDong party, the First Secretary? Le Duan, laid thebasis for the formation of the South Vietnam Liberationfront by calling for a broad national united front./V7e
We know from evidence to which reference must not be publicly made that in early November Hanoi orderedtheir leaders in the South to prepare the ground forthe announcement of the formation of the national liberation Fronts    to draw up the first draft of amanifesto for the party central committee to consider;and to recruit personalities for appointments in theFront, Nguyen Huu Tho, the present chairman of the liberation Front Central Committee, being mentioned by name.   On 11 December Hanoi informed the South of thedate for the public announcement of the Front which was finally made in Hanoi on 29 January 1961.5.     During 1961 infiltration continued at a level ofabout 500 men per month and terrorist activities &quot; :continued to rise,2,000 village officials beingassassinated by the Viet Cong.    That these subversiveterrorist activities were supported and organised bythe North was recognised in 1962 in a special reportby the International Control Commission, the Polishmember dissenting (Cmnd. 1755).6.     At this time the American presence in Vietnam wassmall, there being only 685 military instructors inMAAG in 1961, whose    presence was noted by the I.C.C.(the Polish member dissenting) as not contravening the geneva Agreements.   However in the. same year themilitary situation in the South deteriorated so thatin December, in response to an appeal by PresidentDiem, President Kennedy agreed to increase american assistance to the South Vietnamese defence effort./7.- 3 -
SECRET- k -7.     We calculate from American reports, which are mostly based on prisoner interrogations,  that Toy theend of 1962 the number of trained personnel who hadinfiltrated from North Vietnam into the South was some 28,000 with infiltration continuing at the rateof about 1,000 a month.    At that time there were12,000 American advisers in South Vietnam.8.     In 196k, North Vietnamese torpedo-boats attacked the U.S. destroyer &quot;Maddox&quot; in the international watersin the Gulf of Tonkin,  and subsequently repeated the attacks.    Following a resolution by both Houses of congress, authorising the President to repel any armed attack on United States forces and to prevent furtheraggression,  the United States took retaliatory air action against North Vietnamese gun-boats and bases.In February 1965, U.S. barrack areas at Pleiku andQui Nhon in South Vietnam were attacked, which led tothe first systematic American retaliatory air actionagainst military targets in North Vietnam.    In May1965 the first formed units of the North Vietnamesearmy (as opposed to individual North Vietnameseoperating with the Viet Gong) were identified asoperating in the South.   Finally in June 1965 GeneralWestmoreland was given authority to use U.S. troopsin offensive operations in South Vietnam.    The basisof the present situation was thus laid.    Our ownestimate from total intelligence sources, mostlyAmerican but including sources to which referencemust not be made publicly, is that there are now about53,000 regular North Vietnamese troops operating inthe South together with 190,000 Viet Cong fighters and/6C,000
60,000 political and administration personnel.    Infil-tration from tho North fluctuates according to weather and military plans, but the monthly average rate throughthe present year has been about k,000.    American troopsnumber h60,000 with 55,000 allied troops end 320,000regular South Vietnamese troops.9.     It follows from the foregoing chronology that theUnited States and South Vietnamese have taken their action in response to hostile activity by the north vietnamese against both the territorial integrity andpolitical independence of South Vietnam.    The north vietnamese have no grounds for claiming that their action was in self-defence , while the South Vietnamesehave every reason to claim that theirs is and the UnitedStates equal reason to justify their assistance.Current Warfare10.     The two most criticised activities of the war arethe American bombing and North Vietnamese terrorism.American bombing has been gainst targets related to theVietnamese military effort in the South.    Great careis taken to minmise the civilian co::ualties and,although it is difficult for us to know what casualties have occurred, our assessment is that these aresurprisingly low even for raids on targets within or near Hanoi.il-    North Vietnamese and Viet Cong terrorism is betterdocumented.    It is both indiscriminate and directed against the local administration in the South.According to published American figures, between/1960- 5 -
-     6    T&quot;     &apos;i960 and 1965 (before any U.S. troops were committed to combat) 35,000 members of the South Vietnamese forces had been hilled, 8,000 Government officials and civilians assassinated and       000 civilians kidnapped.According to our     count, derived from publishedAmerican figures, in the two years 1965 and 1966,if,625 civilians were killed, 7,742 wounded and 7,814kidnapped.   For the first six months of this year thefigures are 1,317 killed, 2,328 wounded and 1,777kidnapped.Current PositionSouth Vietnamese12.     The South Vietnamese Government have stated thatthey have no territorial ambitions nor any desire to change the politic::.! regime of the North.    Put theyresist the claim that the National Liberation Front isrepresentative, lot alone the sole representative;,of the South Vietnamese.    The recent Presidentialelections, where 82 per cent of the registered electoratevoted on eleven candidates,  bear this out.    Significantabstentions would have indicated a support fortendencies, Viet Cong or neutralist,  that were not represented among the candidates. This did not occur.13-     Although many problems of international law areraised in the case of divided states like   Vietnam,it must be noted that as one of the successorGovernments to that of one of the French Union States(the other two are Laos and Cambodia), the Governmentof the PlOpublic of Vietnam has been internationally/recognised
recognised by more than 60 states including the majorVie stern powers.    South Vietnam has the right, whichhas long been established in international law andis recognised by Article 51 of the United nations charter,  of individual and collective self-defence.In.resisting the present North Vietnamese attack on her and in requesting the United States to assist her(formally in December 1961),  she is exercising these rights.    Though the South Vietnamese are not membersof the United Nations, the Americans, as required by article 51? have kept the Security Council generallyinformed of their actions in Vietnam.AmericanIk.     In addition to specific assurances given by successive American Presidents (by President Eisenhowerin a letter to President Diem on 23 October,  1954,&quot;by President Kennedy in a letter to President Diem onIk December,  1961 and in a White House statement on30 October, 1963;    by President Johnson in anaffirmation in the Senate on 27 November, 1963 and on several subsequent occasions), the United States have declared that their support for South Vietnam is inaccordance with their obligations under the SPATOTreaty,  South Vietnam being a &quot;protocol state&quot; coveredby the treaty.    (This position was affirmed in theCongressional resolution of 7 August, 1964.)    Wehave made it plain, however, that we do not view ourSEATO obligations in the same way as do the UnitedStates, and in any case South Vietnam has not formally/invoked- 7 -
SECRET- 8invoked SEATO help.   Even if she did, our view is that .it is open to each party to put its own interpretationon the treaty requirement to &quot;act to meet the   commondanger      and thus that each individual member wouldhave to decide for itself how to respond.15,     The Americans say that they hove no wish to change the North Vietnamese regime:    are concerned onlyto help the South Vietnamese to bent off the north vietnamese attack;    wish for no bases in Vietnam;    wishfor a negotiated settlement to end the fighting;    andare content that this should be on the basis of the geneva Agreements.    They have said that they are ready for unconditional negotiations, for a public conference,or private talks, are ready to precede talks with mutualmilitary restraint v,ith or without a formal cease-fire.They are publicly committed by the Manila Communique(October 1966) to withdraw their forces not later thansin months after the end of violence and the withdrawalof Communist forces to the North.    They have offered to spend large sums of money on the rehabilitation ofthe Mekong area, including North Vietnam if Hanoidesires it, eater the cessation of hostilities.16.     They have attempted to explore the ground onwhich negotiations might take place both by directconfidential channels and by Intermediarites,   Directlow-level contacts have token place on a number of occasions but they have never developed to the pointof offering a prospect of negotiations./IT.
- Q -- ^  -XI,     In addition, the U.S. have initiated fivebombing pauses, one 37 days long, in the hope thatone of them would lead to a cease-fire and negotiations.With the disputed exception of U Thanfs initiative in Rangoon in 196U, the Americans have encouragedthird parties in their efforts to bring about acease fire and negotiations.North Vietnamese18.     The North Vietnamese hold firm on their &quot;four points&quot; (U.8. withdrawal;    respect for GenevaAgreements;    adoption of Liberation Front programme;peaceful reunification) and on the claim, most recentlyrepeated both by their Prime Minister,  Pham Van Hong,and the official North Vietnamese newspaper,that the Liberation front is the sole genuinerepresentative of the people of South Vietnam,    their current attitude to the possibility of negotiation Isbased on the interview given by their foreignMinister in January this year in which he said that;&quot;only after the unconditional cessation of U.S.bombing and all acts of war against the D.R.V.could there be talks between the P.H.V. and theUnited States&quot;.19.     In addition, the North Vietnamese maintain that there can be no equality of treatment for the aggressor (in their view the United States) and the victim and that there can be no reciprocity betweenthe two sides.    All proposals so far put forward/have,
- 10hove, in North Vietnamese eyes, suffered from thisdisability and have, therefore, been rejected.Equally, all efforts to discoverwhether north vietnam would, in fact,  start talking after a cessation of bombing have failed.    In New York &apos; in SeptemberMr, Gromyko would only say in private that if the rev;erc an unconditional cessation &quot;the situation wouldhave changed&quot;, and &quot;conditions would be more favourable&quot;.Pre cent American Attitude20.    As a result of this North Vietnamese attitude and international criticism of the bombing, PresidentJohnson has moved from his position in February thatbombing would stop when North Vietnamese infiltrationhad stopped to a publicly stated willingness to order a cessation of bombing &quot;when this will lead promptlyto productive discussion&quot;,  provided only that whilediscussions proceed the North Vietnamese would not take military advantage of the bombing cessation or limi-tation.    The North Vietnamese have made no responsiveshift in their policy.British Attitude21.     British responsibility is two-folds-- As a major power concerned with thesecurity of South Fast Asia as a whole;- As a Co-Chairman of the geneva conference of 1954 and 1962.
SECRET-II -22.     for the first, it is accepted by our friends andallies that our military non-involvement in Vietnamdoes not mean teat wa have abandoned all concern withthe security and stability of the whole region.    nor does it inhibit us from giving aid and support to SouthVietnam and the U.3. presence there,  because it Is inour general interest that there should be a strong andviable South Vietnam so that the people of South Vietnamshould be capable of deciding their future,  and thequestion of reunification, free from foreign inter-fore nee .   We therefore believe that South Vietnam&apos;sresistance to encroachment   from the North is right.23.     for the second, it has to be accepted that the geneva Co-Chairmanship Imposes a responsibility withouteffective power.    The Geneva machinery is basicallya means of reaching and giving effect to a settlement,and the Geneva Agreements themselves are in many partstext rally obsolete after 13 years.    The geneva conference can reconvene only if its members willattend;   and so far not even the Soviet Co-Chairman,let alone China and North Vietnam, have conceded thatthe time is right to do so.    The essential value ofthe Geneva machinery is that it remains in existence,by tacit understanding between all concerned,  againstthe day when it can be used;    and that we test itperiodically to see whether this day is near.
