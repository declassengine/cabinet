$UMENTC(67) 187 COPY NO.        g g28th November, 1967CABINETTHE APPROACH TO europe memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs at the last meeting of the Six there was a general feeling thatthe crucial question - whether to open negotiations with Britain - wouldhave to be faced at the next Council meeting of the Six Foreign ministers on 18th - 19th December.    De Gaulle&apos;s press conference has brought the crunch nearer.    (The text of what he said is at Annex A).2.       The alternatives are:-(a) to leave the Six to take their decision without advice from us.This might lead to a further period of uncertainty, and to theproposal by the Six of some alternative to negotiations for full member ship j(b) subject to the result of the consultations referred to inparagraph 4 below, to urge the Five to insist on fixing a date in January for the opening of negotiations, and so force the issue with the French either on 18th - 19th December or at the beginning of January;(c) to continue urging an early decision, but without insisting onthe January date. We would then not be maintaining with theFive that, if we had to wait a little longer, our position wouldbe untenable;(d) to let the Five and the French off the hook, by indicatingreadiness to consider alterxiatives to negotiations for full membership, such as(i)  a form of association, or membership by stages;  or(ii) pre-negotiation discussions.3.      I do not like either (a) or (d).    The alternatives in (d) aredangerous (they are considered more fully in Annex B).    They wouldmean facing a further long period of uncertainty.    All the steam would go out of our European policy.    (a) would be likely to lead to the same result.    And we shall not avoid giving advice to the Five withoutappearing to have lost interest in the outcome.    (c) is a continuation ofour present policy, which I believe is beginning to expose the Governmentto criticism.-1-IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)
4.      I therefore favour (b).    I should like the authority of mycolleagues to urge this course on the Five during the next two weeks.We shall have to press them hard, for some of them will go to greatlengths to avoid a showdown with the French.    I should like to begin by putting the idea to Dr. Lams when he comes here on 5th December,Subject to his advice, I would then pursue the idea with MM. Brandtand Nenni when they are here on 9tb December.    Because of the dangerof a leak, I would say nothing to the Luxembourg Foreign Minister(here on 1st December) or M. Rey (here on 4th December).5.       Nor can we deal with the issue of membership of the community in isolation.    Irritation with France over her attitude to the Gold Pooland the discussion of the future of the Alliance in the NATO Council on13th - 14th December will be very important pieces in the game.    Byfacing these various issues in isolation, we allow de Gaulle to choosehis time for piecemeal attacks and to defeat us in detail.    It will be important to know how the United States views French policies, and tohave her support and perhaps assistance over NATO and gold.    I have this in hand.6,       It is possible that de Gaulle can be forced to give way.    And ifhe gives way on one major policy issue, his front may give elsewhere.Alternatively, the course which I recommend could lead to a Frenchveto on negotiations, more or less disguised.    (But the Five will notin the end want to share French responsibility).    We shall then atleast know where we stand for the immediate future.    If we are unableto join the Community now, we shall have ensured that bitternessagainst France will hold up its progress for what may be a long time.And we shall then be able to consider the alternatives and decide future policy in an atmosphere much more favourable than that under courses(a) or (d).G.B.Foreign Office, S.W.1.28th November, 1967
ANNTTK A.Tex.lL,o f^t hejn.French, Prgsjlent&apos;s, statementH?ii.Pfcii^The following is a complete translation of General GeGaulle&apos;s statement on Britain and the Communities:Prom the moment when there were men and there were states,any great international plan has rested on seductive myths.That is quite natural since inspiration is always at the origin of action,    And sos as regards the unity of Europe,, how fine itwould he, how good it would he if Europe could &quot;become afraternal whole where each people would find its prosperityand its security.    The same is true for the world.    Howmarvellous it would be if all the differences of race,language, ideologies, riches, all the rivalries, frontiersthat have divided the earth since the beginning could,disappear.    But however attractive dreams are, the realitiesare there.    And it is by following these realities or not thatpolitics can be a fertile art or a vain Utopia.    It is in thisway that the idea of linking the British Isles to the economic community; consisting of the six continental states, gives riseeverywhere to wishes which are in theory very justified.    Butit is a question of knowing whether this could be done atpresent without tearing up or breaking what exists.,    For ithappens that Great Britain, with an insistence and a hastequite out of the ordinary, and on which perhaps the recentmonetary events have thrown a certain light, has proposed theimmediate opening of negotiations between herself and the Sixwith a view to her entering the Common Market.    At the sametime she has said that she accepts all the dispositions whichgovern the Community of the Six - which would seem a littlecontradictory with a request to start negotiations.    For why should one negotiate about clauses which have been entirely/accepted
accented in advance. In fact we are seeing the fifth act of adrama in the course of which the various attitudes of theUnited Kingdom with regard to the Common Market have succeededone another without resembling one another. The first act wasthe refusal of London to participate in the formulation of theTreaty of Pome which, it was thought on the other side of theChannel; would come to nothing.    The second act showed the deephostility of Britain towards the construction of Europe as soonmakeas the larter began to/its appearance.    And I can still hear theexhortations, I think I have already mentioned it before, theearning which my friend Mr. Macmillan, then Prime Minister,addressed to me in June 1958 in Paris.    He compared the common market with the Continental Blockade and threatened to declareagainst it at least a war of tariffs.2,    The third act was the negotiation at Brussels conducted byMr. Maudling for a year and a half.    This negotiation was designed to bend the Community to the conditions imposed by-Great Britain,    It was brought to an end when Prance made itclear to her partners that this was not the question at issuebut precisely the opposite.3.    At the start of Mr. Wilson&apos;s Government the fourth act wascharacterised by a lack of interest In London regarding theCommon Market, by the maintenance around Great Britain of the sixother European countries which made up the Free Trade Area andby a great effort to tighten the internal links of theCommonwealth.    And now unfolds the fifth act in which GreatBritain this time puts forward, her candidacy and in order thatit should be accepted embarks on all the promises and all the pressures imaginable.    In fact this attitude can be quiteeasily explained.    The British people no doubt see more and more clearly that in the great movement which is carrying the world/forwards
forward j before the enormous power of the United States - the(towing power of the Soviet Union, - the newborn power of thecontinental countries - the new power of China, and taking intoaccount the more and more centrifugal forces which appear in theCommonwealth., their systems and their habits,  her activities andeven her national personality are henceforth at stake.    Andafter all, the grave economic, financial, monetary difficultiesin whose grip she finds herself make themselves felt day afterday.   And from there comes a tendency to discover in her owndepths a framework, perhaps European, which would allow her,help her to save and to safeguard her own substance^ whichwould allow her to play once again a leading role and whichwould relieve her of a part of her burden.lb    There is nothing in that which is not salutary for her,and in the long run,  there is nothing but satisfaction in thatfor Europe, provided that the British people, like those whom they wish to join, desire to and know how to bring upon them-seives the fundamental changes which would be necessary in orderto ensure their own stability.    For it is a radical modificationand transformation of Britain which is necessary in order thatshe can join the continentals.    Phis is obvious from thepolitical point of view, but - to speak only of the economic sphere today - the report which the Brussels Commission submitted on the 29th of September to the Governments of the Six showswith the greatest clarity that the present Common Market is?incompatible with the economy as it exists at present - of britain, whose chronic balance of payments deficit is proof of&quot;permanent disequilibrium, and shows features concerningproduction, sources of supply, credit policies, working-conditions, which she could not alter without transforming her own nature.
GO N n DE   j^trI?    The Common Market is also incompatible with the manner in which the British provision themselves, as much by their ownagricultural produce, very highly subsidised, as by the foodproducts they purchase cheaply throughout the world, notablyfrom the Commonwealth, which makes it impossible for Londonever in fact to accept the levies laid down in the financialRegulation which would be crushing for Britain.    The common market is, moreover,  incompatible with the restrictions laiddown by the British concerning the transfer of capital which,by contrast, circulates freely between the Six.    The common market is incompatible with the state of sterling which has beenhighlighted again by devaluation, as well as by the loans which preceded and accompanied it.    Stealing&apos;s condition together withthe pound&apos;s character as an international currency and the enormous external balances which encumber it, prevent it atpresent from joining the solid united and secure group whichcomprises the franc,  the mark,  the lira,  the Belgian franc andthe florin.    In these conditions, what could be the effect ofwhat is called the entry of Britain into the Common Market?If there was a desire, despite everything, to impose this, itwold obviously mean the collapse of a Community which has been constructed by and. which functions by rules which do not allow for such a monumental exception,,    Furthermore, certainly I should add that this Community could not withstand the introduction of astate which precisely by its currency,  its economy and its policydoes not at present form part of Europe in the sense in which weHave begun to practice it.6*    To allow Britain to enter, and by consequence to become involved in a negotiation to that effect now, would be, for the six - given that everyone knows what this involves - to granttheir consent in advance to all the tricks, delays, pretences/which
jjiich would tend to disguise what would &quot;be the virtual&apos;destruction of an edifice which has been built at the price ofco many difficulties and amidst so much hope.    It is -true thatill! recognising the impossibility of letting the Britain oftoday enter the Common Market In its present form, one might allthe same wish to sacrifice the Common Market for an agreementrith Britain.    It is true that, in theory,, the economic systemshich is at present practised by the Six is not necessarily theonly one that Europe could practise.    One could imagine, forexample, a free trade area spreading over the whole of the west of our continent.    One could also imagine a sort of multilateraltreaty of the kind which emerged from the Kennedy Round,regulating between ten, twelve or fifteen European states theirrespective reciprocal quotas and tariffs.    But in both thesecases, one would first have to abolish the Community and breakup its institutions.    And I can say that prance is certainly not asking for that.    However,  if one or another of her partners, asis after all their right, should make the proposal, Prance would examine it with the other signatories of the Pome Treaty.7,    But what she cannot do is to enter at present into a negotiation with the British and their associates which would lead to the destruction of the European structure of which she isa part.    Moreover this would net at all be the way to construct a Europe which is building herself by her own effort and forherself in such a way as to avoid dependence on an economic,Ecnetary and political system which is alien to it.    In ordertiac Europe may be able to form a counterweight to the immensepower of the United States it must at all costs avoid weakeningitself and on the contrary must strengthen the bonds and rulesQf the Community.    Indeed those who, like myself, have proved% their action the attachment and the respect which they have/for
for England, hope deeply to see her- one day choose and accomplish,the immense effort which would transform her.    Indeed to help herin these matters France is quite prepared to enter into some arrangement which, under the name of association or some other,y/ould encourage henceforth commercial exchanges between thecontinentals on the one hand and the British, the Scandinaviansand the Irish on the other.8,     It is certainly not in Paris that one is unaware of the psychological evolution which our friends from across the Channelappear to be showing, or that there is failure to recognise themerit of certain measures which they have already taken, orothers which are projected in order to achieve equilibrium,their interior equilibrium and their external independence.Bat for the British Isles really to moo-^ themselves alongside the Continent, a very vast and very deep transformation is stillrequired,9.    Everything depends therefore net en a negotiation whichwould for the Six be a renunciation telling the knell of theirCommunity, but en the will and action of the great English people who would make of themselves one of the pillars of EuropeanEurope.
AMIX 3Association and Pre-negotiations as Alternativesassociation&quot;During the next few weeks, the suggestion may be made moreformally than hitherto that, rather than pursue the obi activeof full membership of the Community, consideration should begiven to some relationship falling short of full membership.,fhis might take the form of association with the Community,  cr&quot;gembership by stages&quot; (which would involve cur becoming a fulliSEber only after a period, and,  inevitably,  sab j act to accepting the progress the Community might make in the meantime).    Forthe sake of brevity,  &quot;association&quot;  is used in this paper to describe any formal relationship with the Community short of full membership.2.   Hitherto we have rejected association as an alternative to full membership.   The prime Minister, at his meeting withpi. Pompidou and Co live in London in July 1966, rejected theidea that Britain might be a &quot;country member of the club&quot;.    in subsequent talks with   the French ana with ethers we havelaiatained a negative line.    The purpose of this paper is ccconsider what cur reaction should bo in the event of a proposal,or more formal suggestion,  that we should consider associationtether than full membership.association might be proposedAssociation, as an alternative to full membership, might^proposed by the French, cr alternatively by one cr more ofwo five or tho European Commission.V    If France proposes it,  it will be because France does notf?nt us to become a full member of the Community.    But it cannot1,0 assumed that in conseaaienco franco would agree to our association. The French Government have alternated ever thein their preference between association and full membership
for Britain in order to try to avoid appearing too negativej,0Ut whatever Britain seemed tc want at the time. In Marchp1,M. Couvo said that membership was the only solution.    InJanuary 1963? do Gaulle said that nothing prevented our association.    In July 1966, M. Pompidou said that the matteryioidd do truly at issue if Britain decided to undertake thesains burdens and responsibilities as other members.    Todayfranco is suggesting that association would be  the better courseo5,    If association is put forward by one of bhe Five, or bythe European Commission, their votive will be to appease france and  to avoid a crisis in the Community.    Each one of the FiveGovernments have told us that they welcome our application forfall membership;  and that, provided we accept the Treaty andits rules (which they recognise we hay .; done) , full membership is the right course for us and for Europe.    The european commission, in their &quot;opinion&quot; of 29 September, have also accepted that full membership is the right course for Britain.6.    So we must conclude that a proposal of association,whether made by Prance or by one of tho Five or the european commission, will not have as its motive the achievement of asatisfactory relationship between Britain and the Community,hence will put it forward because she seeks to exclude us fromthe Community. The five and tho European Commission will put itforward because they sack to appease Prance.ffhat could association mean?7- A proposal for association put forward in the next few weeksis unlikely to be clearly defined.8*    The name itself is not important.    If a satisfactoryrelationship could be established which foil short of full membership in however large or small degree, we would bo wellsdvised seriously to consider accepting it whatever name mightbe given to it.5&apos;    Throe factors must largely determine our reaction,    first,tile theoretical variety of forms of relationship falling short/of
of full membership is almost infinite.    /&quot;Some of the main onespvc been set oat in SUR0(67) 104 on 21 August,J7   But one thinglill be common to all variations: Britain&apos;s position in the institutions of the Community will bo less effective than thattfafull member.    Second, because of the differing national interests of the Six, and because the theoretical variety offorms of association is infinite, the Six would have the greatest difficulty in agreeing and negotiating a detailed proposal forthe content of association.   Third, under the Pome Treaty theCfDEission would be the body with which the associationagreement would have to be negotiated;.10. raragraphs 11-17 below relate these three factors to our purpose in deciding to seek full membership of the Community.11. When tho Prime Minister announced H.M.G.&apos; s decision to seek full membership of the Community in the House of commons on 2 May, he made it clear that the two main reasons for thedecisions wore(i)    despite short term economic disadvantages, the longterm potential for Europe and therefore for britain in the creation cf a single market of approaching300 million people;(ii)    ensuring that Europe plays in world affairs a part which&apos;the Europe of today is not playing.Hie Prime Minister has since emphasisea   un:importance cf&quot;economic union&quot; in Europe as a condition cf creating viableEuropean industries in the technological field.12.  When the Cabinet decided to apply for full membership itrecognised, in addition to those considerations (the longer term economic advantages; and the &quot;decisive&quot; political advantages), a further consideration: if we were going to join,the sooner the bettor.    This was because cf the important decisions which tho Community were likely to take in the next twop three years; and the need to become a member in order tcInfluence these and other decisions, in the economic field and 1^so in that of political union./13.
\ &apos; How would those policy objectives bo served by an attempt5 associate with the Community, rather than to join it as a fall member?L First; whatever varieties of association might in theory bejpssiblo, the following points are relevant to all..:(a) association could not take the form of a free trade area.    None of the Six would be prepared to go backto 1956.    At the least, therefore, association wouldinvolve accepting some of the common external tariff.It would therefore involve some degree of commoneconomic and commercial policies as between theCommunity and the associate.    The associate could not enjoy an equal voice in decisions affecting commonpolicies unless it was given an equal position with full members whenever decisions were taken in theCommunity&apos;s institutions.    Association with a fullvoice in the institutions would be equivalent to full membership.    VvitioUt a full voice, the associate&apos;sstatus would be that of a colony. Consequently, themore acceptable the content of association would bo tous, the less acceptable it would be, by definition,to Franco.(b) even If a satisfactory arrangement were possible togive the associate a fair voice in the fields coveredby the association agreement, there would be two further problems. Community decisions are oftenbargains resulting from concessions in differentfields (e.g. industry and agriculture). A country witha voice in only limited fields would be at a severedisadvantage.    Secondly, there is the problem thrownup by the development of the Community in other fields,or by new decisions in existing fields: in technology and monetary quest lens-, or in the establishment of anew agricultural regulation (eg. mutton).   This/problem
problem incidentally demonstrates the fallacy ofimagining that full membership could bo &quot;automatic&quot; atthe end of a period of association: no government orparliament could commit itself to accept and operatefar-reaching economic, and even political decisions in the taking of which they had no voice, and of thenumber and direction of which they could have noprior knowledge,(c)    in consequence, Britain&apos;s freedem of action would bolimited by t he terms of association without thecounterpart of being able to limit the freedom ofaction of the Six through the enjoyment of a fullvoice in the institutions,    With the passage of time,and the development of the Community, it wculd becomedifficult tc join and equally difficult to withdraw.15.  Second:   As long as we are applying, for full membership onthe basis of acceptance of the Treaty of Rome, and the rules-adopted under it, the negotiation of our accession is comparatively simple, since it must take place on t ho basis ofagreed texts.    But as scon as something snort of lull membershipbecame the object of negotiation, the room for differences between the Six,  in view of their conflicting national interests,*oul(3 be endless and the time likely tc be taken by the Six in working out common positions on points of detail would mean avery much longer negotiation.   Moreover, on this basis the Fivefould no longer bo united; and Prance would have much more scope-or blackmailing the Five into accepting French terms as theconditions of a successful negotiation than would be the caseUnder negotiations for full membership where the room for&quot;-argument (considerable though it may be)  is much more limited.^&apos;   Thirds, the fact that the Commission would be tlrv body^signatcd by the Community to negotiate on its behalf with-Attain would mean further delays and would put our cwnNegotiators in a more difficult position.   There would bo further/delays
Slays because of tho time required for the Commission to reportfeho Council and got a now mandate at every.stage; and ourjegctiators would at each stage be required to expose their ownffticl without being able to uncover that of the Community.17,  There would be ether disadvantages in showing interest ins3gociation, of whatever form.    Onco it ware accepted byBritain that association was a legitimate objective, the presentatmosphere of crisis within tho Community would disappear and thefive as well as France would feel free to make progress in theCommunity1 s internal development without waiting for the outcome of prolonged negotiations with Britain.    Our position during these developments would be tho worse for the fact that it could to argued that since Britain would not necessarily have toaccept the outcome immediately in the particular field underdiscussion, there was no reason to delay the internal developmentof the Community.    On the other hand, tho inevitably prolongednegotiations, and uncertain final content, of association wouldman continuing uncertainty for British industry and foreigninvestment.   The period of uncertainty which we face may well beshorter, and will certainly not be longer,  if wo continue toaanand &quot;full membership or nothing&quot;.    And this latter coursegiyes a greater chance of holding up the development of theComaunity while we wait.delusions13.  In the light of the above we must concludes(i)   whoever puts forward a proposal for association forSrita in as an alternative for full membership will do so for motives which are not designed to help us;(U)   the Six would find tho greatest difficulty in agreeingon the detailed content of their proposals; and forthis reason, and because of the nature of the negotiations,a very long time would olapso before the outcome would be known;meanwhile tho Community would foal free - freer than it/is
is today or would bo while we sack full membership -tc intensify its internal development;II)   end at the same time British industry and foreigninvestment would face a longer period of uncertainty;(v)   whatever form association took (assuming that the Sixcould agree to it taking any form at all) the essentialcommon clement of all forms would be a position for britain in the insitut ions of the Community whichwould be less effective than the positions enjoyed by full members, oven in respect of common policies which Britain would have tc apply at once;(vi)   if the purpose of association wore to prepare for fullmoaborship, the number of decisions taken without ourvoice being properly heard would, because these decisions would have to be applied by us as a conditionof full membership, postpone the day of full membership,perhaps indefinitely;(yii)   wo should be denied for an indefinite period theadvantages - political,  economic and institutional -which determined H.M.G. to apply for membership; and weshould have allowed the Six to circumscribe our ownfreedom of action without any corresponding influence on theirs.19.  If, therefore, a proposal cf this kind is put forward inthe coming weeks, we should not be deterred from our presentlino.   Our line should be that we have applied for full member-ship under Article 237 in accordance with the advice given to us% five out of the six governments (France, too,  if we take theS(lvice given by M. Couve in 1961 and M. Pompidou in 1966.)pis has been recognised hy the Commission as well as by the Fivellc bo the right course and the Commission has proposed thatt?negotiations should now open. The Six agreed at the Rome Summit*0 apply the Treaty in respect of applications for membership,await a reply to our application from the Six as a whole./If
CONFIDENTIAL

If, the suggestion for association is made by the French, we should encourage the Five to refuse to consider it.

"Pre-negotiations" or talks about negotiations

20. In comparison with association, some form of pre-negotiations, whether with representatives of the Six or with the Commission, would have two advantages:

(a) the French would probably not agree. So it could be a useful tactical position for us to adopt vis à vis the Five, that as long as the objective was full membership, we were flexible as to the form in which the problems were discussed;

(b) if the French did agree, full membership (which is what we want) would be maintained as the objective.

21. But it would be difficult, if we followed this course, to avoid certain risks:

(i) it would be hard to avoid uncovering our negotiating position during pre-negotiations, and easier for the Six to avoid uncovering theirs;

(ii) there would be the danger that the Community might seek to use the results of pre-negotiation talks (however unreasonably) as an excuse to go back on their acceptance of full membership as the right solution;

(iii) the Community might feel that, once pre-negotiation talks had started, they would be free to agree further development within the Community without our being involved.

22. The dangers in the previous paragraph would be limited if, as part of the agreement to conduct pre-negotiation talks, the six fixed a firm date for opening formal negotiations. But for this very reason, it is most unlikely that the option would present itself in this form.
