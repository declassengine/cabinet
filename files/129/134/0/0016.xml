C(67) 18628th November, 1967COPY NO,CABINETTHEATRESMemorandum by the Secretary of State forthj^ tbpjne^epartm^ntOn 24th November the Home Affairs Committee agreedunanimously to the proposal in my memorandum on theatres thatthere is no means of effectively prohibiting the presentation of livingpersons, and that the Theatres Bill should therefore follow therecommendations of the Select Committee on Theatre Censorship inmaking defamation in a stage play a ground for an action for libel.Since, however, this problem had been remitted for further considera-tion (CC(67) 53rd Conclusions, Miimts 3), the Committee invited meto report on it to the Cabinet.I.     If any helpful and practicable suggestions are made in parliament for dealing with the representation of living persons we should of course be willing to consider them, but I have not so far been able to arrive atany satisfactory method of dealing with the problem.    One suggestion,put to ms by Lord Goodman, was that the Bill might provide thatThe Queen was not to be represented on the stage, and also thatrepresentation of people in their private, as opposed to their public,lives should be prohibited.    The Lord Chamberlain^ Office do not like singling out The Queen and I could not recommend it.   I find difficulty in his other suggestion also, and I think that he must havedone so too, as he has not succeeded in providing the draft which hesaid he would try to produce.    A distinction between public and privatelife would be hard enough to handle in relation to people in a publicposition.    It would be even harder in relation to private citizens.The Lord Chamberlain is concerned, not so much with, satire relatingto public men, as with the type of representation that purports to be a true record, e. g. of a notable trial, but is in fact false.     The sufferermay be a private citizen, but the events portrayed may be public events and would presumably be held to relate to his public life.3.     The second possibility would be to adapt Mr. Benn LevyTs bill and simply prohibit the representation of living persons or thoserecently dead, whether the characterisation was true or false,benevolent or malicious.    This would cover only representation of aperson by name.     Without more elaborate provision it would not coverrepresentation by a slight change of name or by inference, and I reallydo not think that a provision on these lines would achieve very much.Moreover, Mr. Benn LevyJs proposition (from which he recoiled in his evidence before the Select Committee) is not as simple as it looks.Would it be limited to persons who are (or were at the time of theirdeath) ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, or would it beuniversal?-1-document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
4.     Turning to what would have to be done to provide a watertightprohibition there are the following difficulties;-(a) Prohibition would have to be either absolute or qualified,in the sense that only invidious representation was prohibited.    If absolute, it would be more restrictivethan the present practice of the Lord Chamberlain; but ifqualified it would be left to the courts to decide whetherthe representation was invidious or not, and the procedures for deciding that question would differ so little from the trial or an action for defamation that we might as wellrely on the law of defamation, as proposed by the Committee.(b) In a satirical production it would, as noticed above, be easy to present a public figure under some different name, or ina change of setting, but in circumstances which made itclear who was intended.    If this were to be prevented itwould involve a judgment by the courts in particular caseson whether there had been a representation (or an invidiousrepresentation) of a living person or not, and again thiswould not be far removed from an action for defamation.(c) A playwright could quite easily ridicule or vilify a person,whether he was portrayed as a character in the play cr not,and that could be prevented only by prohibiting references(or invidious references) to living persons, as well as theircharacterisation.5.     These are practical difficulties, but I believe there are alsoobjections of principle.    The Select Committee attached importance toplacing the theatre on the same footing as other media, and to prohibit the characterisation of living persons would be criticised as substitutingone form of political censorship for another.    The prevalence ofpolitical satire was one of the main causes of the original LicensingAct of 1737.conclusion.     I therefore invite the Cabinet to endorse the decision of theHome Affairs Committee on this point.R. H. J.Home Office, S. W. 1.27th November, 1967-2-
