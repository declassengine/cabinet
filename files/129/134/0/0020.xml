DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)G [)C(67) 191 COPY NO. :_12th. December, 1967CABINETBRITISH EUROPEAN AIRWAYS RE-EQUIPMENTMemorandum by the Minister of Technology-Failures of past policy the choice of aircraft for British European Airways (.BEA)involves major problems of aircraft industry policy.    Too often in thepast we have embarked on civil projects without adequate appraisal of market or economic justification!  aircraft have been designed to meetthe needs of British users, with no sufficient base of firm airlinecommitments]   costs have escalated.    The result has been disappointingsales and a failure to recover both industry!s and the Governmentsinvestment.    The VC.10 and Trident are examples of this policy.The importance of an assured market2.       We should not start another major civil aircraft project unless there is an assured market, in terms of some foreign airline commitment,and prospects of a worth-while return on the investment.The growing impact of United States competition3.      American competition must be a major factor in our calculations.They have the largest home market in the world, and their industryproduces 80 per cent of aircraft outside Russia.    Their companiesinsist on securing commitments from two or three major airlines before they start a new project.    They were able to brush aside competition from the VC.10 and Trident, and have been able to restrict even the bac. 1-11 so far feo about a fifth of the market, although it was first inthe field, some 24 months earlier than the Douglas DC. 9 and 46 monthsearlier than the Boeing 737, its two rivals.Why we adopted a European aircraft policy.       There is little chance in future of any European country meeting this challenge alone, and the arguments point inexorably towards european co-operation if v/e are to avoid American domination.    The combineddomestic market in Europe^ though still substantially smaller- than thatin America, is potentially big enough to sustain a competitive aircraft industry.-1-
5.       The total Western World demand for civil aircraft from 1967 to1976 is estimated both here and in America at some  15, 000 million, ofwhich, a properly organised European aircraft industry supported byco-ordinated European purchasing policies could obtain more thanone-third.    The United Kingdom part of this European share could bea half, or some  2, 750 million.    This compares with about 1, 500 million worth cf orders which we might expect to secure in thelight of past achievement by the United Kingdom industry going it alone.6.       Therefore the best long term future for the British aircraft industry, and the best sure outlet for Rolls Royce engines, lies inco-operation with Europe.    This in. turn will strengthen engine salesprospects in the United States of America; Rolls Royce itself could not expect to survive without a European airframe industry.The criteria laid down for the Airbus7.       It was on this basis that the Cabinet decided to enter on the first stage of the Airbus.    The Cabinet rightly laid down conditions as to useof a Rolls Royce engine, with the assured orders from the French,German and British national airlines, and carefully established prospects of a wider market.Progress report on Airbus8.       The first stage is going reasonably welh the framework ofindustrial co-operation is taking shape, and though it is too ea.rly yetfor firm estimates, the sales prospects remain hopeful.    It is quiteuntrue to say that Lufthansa have decided not to buy the Airbus; underthe terms of the international Agreement, each Government has until themiddle of next year to secure a commitment from its national airline.Devaluation marginally improves Airbus prospects .       Though devaluation will make the Airbus dearer for BEA, it shouldmake it cheaper in overseas markets, and thus more likely to succeed.British equipment for the aircraft will also now be more competitive.Our European policy is the right one10.      From all this, I conclude that;-(a) the European policy that we have embarked on is the right one;(b) after the airbus, our next major project should be cast in thesame mould;, and meet similar criteria.    This almost certainlypoints towards a 200 seat aircraft of advanced design,entering service in the second half of the 1970s and aimed ata later, bigger, and more secure market than the BAC. 2-11.-2-
The case against: the BAC. 2-1111.       Our choice of aircraft for BEA must be consistent with thispolicy.    The BAC 2-11 runs counter to it, and suffers from thefollowing drawbacks(a) BAC. 2-11 will prejudice Airbus ;it is likely to reduce orders for the Airbus and jeopardisethat project.    T  there is no European Airbus, BEA will haveto buy an American one in the late 1970s;(b) BAC. 2-11 will prejudice Rolls/ Snecma link:it will, by endangering the Airbus, put at risk the collaboration which is being built up between Rolls Royceand Snecma on the basis of the RB.207 airbus engine, andwhich is aimed at breaking the Snecma /Pratt and Whitneyconnection, and thus at preventing the domination of theEuropean market by American engines;(c) BAC. 2-11 export prospects very uncertain;the project would be a gamble.    If BACJs estimates wereright, there would be no need for 90 per cent Governmentlaunching aid.    Export sales are 5 to 10 years awayy andthere must be considerable doubt whether the price advantagenow offered by devaluation will survive so long^  the aircraftmay prove unable to break the hold on world markets of the boeing 727/200, which goes into service next year;  to theextent that it looks likely to succeed, it will impel the americans to build a rival (perhaps an improvement of the727/200), which could get on the market by 1973 or 1974.    the bac. 2-11 would not be available in quantity for export before that time, because the bulk of the first two years&apos; production would be required by BEA.    It would thus not be substantiallyahead in world markets;(d) BAC. 2-11 involves heavy public expenditure;launching costs to the Exchequer would be an open-endedcommitmen t of some  120 million compared with a maximumcommitment of some  15 million for the Trident 3B.    Thiswould mean some  20 million per year extra at a time when there is heavy pressure to restrain Government expenditure.The attached table shov/s the implied preference or subsidyrates involved in the project.(e) BAC offer on launching costs is not serious;the recent offer by the British Aircraft Corporation tocontribute some  7.5 million does not affect the picturesignificantly.    On the formula which they have offered, their contribution would be recovered over the BEA order and therewould be no ceiling on the Government contribution.    Nor areBAC yet prepared to quote a firm price for the aircraft.    Theyare therefore not at risk;-3-CONF9DEMT1AL
CO     Financial advantage of BAG. 2-11 to BEA is within the margin of errorBEATs earnings with the BAC. 2-11 would be greater, but only bysome 1 per cent or 2 per cent as compared with the Tridentover the 10 years to 1978.Rolls Royce^ interests12.       Rolls Royce need to have an application for their new technologyengines.    This is provided by the Airbus.    If we launch the BAC. 2-11the French may -(a) press to return to the American JT.9D engine, which they havewanted all along, on the grounds that development of the rb.211 might imperil the timely development of the Airbusengine;(b) in the last resort, withdraw from partnership with us, on thegrounds that we have launched a competing aircraft and engine,and form a new partnership within e.c., probably with theGermans and Italians, thus effectively excluding us fromEuropean civil aircraft for the foreseeable future.Devaluation points towards the Trident 3B13.      Devaluation -(a) makes the Airbus project marginally more attractive, and hence makes less desirable any competition to it;(b) improves the prospects of Rolls Royce winning the competition with the P.B. 211 engine for the American Airbuses, and,therefore, reduces the need for the BAG. 2-11 as a means forlaunching the engine.    Development of the engine for the bac. 2-11, so far from preceding and therefore helping,might conflict with the development of the engine for theAmerican Airbuses;(c) makes the Trident 3B at least as economical for BEA as the boeing 727/200;(d) calls for a more stringent review of public expenditure:  thefleet with Trident 3B will be some  79 million cheaper overthe five year period to 1971-2 than the fleet with BAC. 2-11.Case for the Trident 3314.       The Trident 3B:-(a) will be available at least a year earlier than the BAC. 2-11;(b) will be at least as economic in operating costs as the boeing 727/200;-4-confidential 
(c) is the cheapest way of providing BEA with a satisfactoryaircraft.    It will cost the Exchequer some  79 million lessover five years to 1971-72 than BAC. 2-11;(d) will cost a maximum of  15 million to launch, with HawkerGiddeley Aircraft (HSA) carrying the risk of excess costs,compared with the open-ended commitment of  120 million for die BAC. 2-11;(e) has some, even though small, export/import saving prospects;(f) will have similar noise characteristics to the Boeing 727/200;(g) will enable BEA to achieve savings, both in pilot training and operation, from commonality with other Trident fleets.15.       BEA need a decision urgently.   Both. BAC and Hanker Siddeleyhave been keeping open our option by continuing design work on the bac. 2-11 and Trident 3B at their own expense.    They will not continueto do so.    We must therefore take a decision now.16.      I accordingly invite my colleagues to agree that, if BEAre-equipment is to go beyond their existing types, it should be on thebasis of a minimum buy of Trident 3Bs.A. W.B.Ministry of Technology, S.W.1.11th December, 1967
ANNEXBAC. 2-11A.        Implied SubsidiesThe table below gives the Government loss (i. e. launchingcost minus recoveries from sales) expressed as a percentage of export/import saving.    For example, if 150 BAC. 2-lls are sold the discountedloss (at  46 million) will be 18 per cent of the net foreign exchangebenefit ( 258 million).    There is hence an implied subsidy of 18 per cent.All figures are discounted and allow for savings achieved by not havingTrident 3B.100 sales 150 sales 200 sales37% (20%) 18% (9%) 10% (4%)B*        Implied PreferencesThe table below gives the percentage by which the national resources used exceed the foreign exchange benefit (by export earningsor import saving).    For example, if 150 BAC. 2-lls are sold, exportearning/import saving would be some  284 million.    The national resources used v/ould be some  345 million, i. e. 21 per cent higher.All figures are discounted.100 sales 150 sales 200 sales41% (26%) 21% (15%) 11% (3%)NOTES;The figures in brackets assume that the basic cost of launchingthe RB.211 engine is borne by an American Airbus.BEA is assumed to buy 34 BAC. 2-lls in all cases.The implied preference or subsidy now acceptable is, cf course,less than it was before devaluation.-6-CONFJDENT1AL
