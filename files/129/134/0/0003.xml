3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)65C(67) 173 COPY NO. _7th November, 1967CABINETTHE THIRD LONDON airport memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade andthe Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentFollowing Cabinet approval in May (CC(67) 29th Conclusions,Minute 1) of the choice of Stansted as the third London airport, the endorsement by the House of Commons of this decision following a debate on 29th June, and the rejection by the Courts on 26th July of a claim by the Essex County Council that the Minister of Housing andLocal Government was acting ultra vires in the matter, the next formalstep would be to lay, in both Houses of Parliament, a SpecialDevelopment Order (SDO) conferring the necessary planning permission for the development of the airport on the British Airports authority which owns and manages it.    It had been intended to lay this Order,which is subject to negative resolution in either House, in October.2.      There have, however, been a number of developments which make it desirable once more to refer the matter to the Cabinet.    Theseare briefly: -(a) recent studies show that a re-alignment of the runways at stansted, while adding to its money cost, would very greatlydiminish the disadvantages of the site on noise groundsj(b) cost/benefit studies, not previously attempted, have beencarried out by an interdepartmental committee during the past few weeks.    While broadly confirming the advantages ofStansted over the alternatives so far considered, these studies have drawn attention to a further possible site atNuthampstead ten miles north west of Stansted.    Althoughit costs more, this site also appears to offer considerable advantages, at any rate over Stansted on its originalalignment, from the point of view of noise j(c) some members of the House of Lords may press for thequestion to be referred to a Select Committee of that House.3.      These factors in combination, and other more general considerations, raise the question whether, even at this late stage, weshould not reconsider the original Cabinet decision.    The followingcourses of action seem to be open to us.-1-
Re-alignment4.      A full note on this possibility is at Appendix B.    Briefly, at a cost (undiscounted) of some  10 million (mainly arising from the need to build two new runways, instead of one plus the existing runv/ay, andfrom an additional land requirement of about 900 acres), it would almost certainly be possible to re-align the Stansted runways through20   / 25   and so very greatly reduce potential noise nuisance.5.      If we decide that the other possibilities discussed later in thismemorandum should be rejected and we go ahead with Stansted, we must clearly explore this possibility further.    Confirmation of, and decisions on, the precise location of the re-aligned runways might take anothermonth or so and, if agreed, the recasting of the SDO another few weeks.The delay of say two months could however be well justified to publicopinion.    We could, at the cost of some further delay, which might be considerable, take the local planning authority and other local interestsinto consultation on this change of plan.    This we believe to be very desirable.6.      We could therefore postpone the Special Development Order for,say, two months or more to enable re-alignment to be fully considered.This would be worth doing, however, only on the clear understandingthat the choice of Stansted is reaffirmed.    This exercise would bepointless and could be embarrassing if, after several months1 delay,it were decided, after all, to refer the whole matter to an independent committee.Cost/benefit study7.       The interdepartmental committee upon whose report theCabinet^ decision in favour of Gtansted was based went into public sector costs in some detail, but did not apply wider cost/benefitanalysis to their study of alternative sites, and no reference to such an approach was therefore made in the White Paper.    Some criticism has arisen on this score.    A cost/benefit study has, however, at thesuggestion of the Ministers concerned, been carried out by an inter-departmental committee over the past few weeks.    Its report is at appendix A.    Broadly, it shows(a) an overall cost/benefit advantage to Stansted by comparisonwith all other sites;(b) that all the alternative sites hitherto supported by the opponents of Stansted appear clearly to be ruled out leavingonly an entirely new site at Nuthampstead as possiblydeserving of further consideration.8.      It miflht be possible on the basis of (b) to set up an independent committee of inquiry to consider, having Nuthampstead in mind, onlysites in the general area of Stansted.
9.       This would avoid some of the considerable delay which may be involved in reference to a more wide ranging inquiry.    But an internalcost/benefit study, carried out moreover in a very limited time and notyet sufficiently refined to be suitable for publication, would scarcelysatisfy public opinion that further consideration ought to be confined tothe Stansted area.Further Internal Consideration10.       It would, of course, be possible to defer the whole matter forfurther interdepartmental consideration of the choice of site; for example,further refinement of the cost/benefit analysis and further discussion ofthe weight to be attached to noise and amenity.    But there are manydisadvantages and no discernible advantages in this course.An Independent Committee11.       Yet another course would be to set up an independent committeeof inquiry into the whole question of the location of the third london airport.    Criticism of the Stansted decision has concentrated as much on the manner in which it was reached as on the decision itself.    Anindependent committee of inquiry appears to be the only way of reassuringpublic opinion that all the considerations bearing on this immenselyimportant question have been fairly and openly assessed and that thefinal decision is the right one.    Other arguments in favour of this courseare as follows(a) the decision in favour of Stansted was taken without any cost/benefit analysis.    The analysis carried out in recent weeks (Appendix A),and which shows Stansted as still the probable best site, was hurriedlydone and necessarily based on estimates and approximations^    Anindependent committee would commission a really thorough analysis;(b) as the problem is examined, new factors come to light, e.g.the Nuthamstead site and the possibility of readjustment;  the cabinet would be reassured by a critical independent examination of the whole problem;(c) the Stansted lobby is not a factor in the calculation - there willbe a lobby v/whatever the site.    What matters is that public opinion generallyis still far from being reassured.    Indeed, doubts have been strengthened by the criticisms recently expressed by the South-East economic planning Council, the Greater -&quot;London Council, and the report ofconsultants on Foulness.    Only an independent investigation can allaythese doubts;(d) an independent committee would avoid the possibility, which appears seriously to be threatened, of reference to a Select Committeeof the House-of Lords.    This would be a most inefficient and inadequatemethod of re-examining the question and could put the Government in ahumiliating position;-3-
(e) politically, the Government might gain positive kudos (especially at this moment of time) by showing itself frankly and openly willing to respond to public anxiety and criticism; a decision to set up an inquirymight well be hailed as a courageous one.    We should also showourselves sensitive to the regional planning considerations mentioned inthe recently published South-East report;(f) finally^ the crux of the matter might be thought to be as follows.If the independent committee of inquiry should find in favour of Stansted,there would be no problem of delay and the airport would still be readyby the time it is needed (1974-76).    If the committee found for someother site, there might be costs and penalties involved in the delay(though opinions differ as to the likelihood and magnitude of these);but they would be well worth accepting in the interests of having selectedthe right site and not the wrong one.12.      As against this it can be argued that:(a) the cost/benefit study, in which account has been taken of theamenity and noise factor, confirms the choice of Stansted -and re-alignment so reduces its noise and amenity disadvantagesas to bring them very close to those of other sites; and on allother counts Stansted is clearly superior;(b) the only serious competitor to Stansted appears to beNuthampstead and this has no advantage tans ted on thescore of regional planning or on any obvious political ground.Indeed the shift might be regarded as derisory and unlikeStansted, its choice would lead to the closure of Luton Airport(allowed for in the cost/benefit study) and some unavoidableoverflying of Cambridge (at heights and frequency comparable with the overflying of, cay, Hampstead by aircraft usingHeathrow);(c) as a result of the Commons debate and the striking out of theEssex County Council writ there is now a general expectation that Stansted will proceed.    It would thus appear ac the worstkind of v/eakness and vacillation for the Government now to reverse its view (stated in the White Paper;   strongly defendedby Government spokesmen and endorsed by the Commons intheir vote on 29th June) that this is essentially a matter for decision by the Government and that reference to an independent committee is both unnecessary and undesirable;(d)it might be possible to deter the Lords from referring thematter to a Select Committee - there is no precedent forsuch a reference: it would bring them into conflict with the commons.    If they insisted it might be possible to control the terms of reference of the Select Committee (although thiswould require the agreement of the House on an instruction tothe Committee) and on the assumption that it would produce no new material, to reject the findings if they were againstStansted or in favour of a further inquiry;
(e) an independent committee of this kind must lead to considerable further delay.    Attempts to accelerate its proceedings wouldbe at the cost of the democratic process which such an inquiry would be intended to serve.    The committee itself mightoccupy anything from 18 months as an absolute minimum onthe assumption that Stansted was confirmed, to possibly three years if other sites had to be seriously considered and their relative merits and demerits pubLicly argued.And in the end (since no conceivable site will not arousemajor and justifiable objections of one sort or another) there might be no clear-cut recommendation but merely a furtheranalysis of pros and cons on which the Government wouldthen have to decide;(f) allowing for the subsequent processes of ratification byParliament, land acquisition, planning and construction and making no provision for unexpected difficultiesj delays orhesitation at any stagey it seems that if Stansted were confirmedit could probably be brought into operation by 1974 but that ifany other site were selected there would be a serious risk ofslippage until 1976 or even later, perhaps much later. *Aii assessment of the potential effects of a delay of this order for civil aviation and for the national economy isat Appendix C.(g) there may be some difficulty in deploying the important defer ueconsideration bearing on the choice of site before a public inquiry but this would probably not prove to be insurmountable.There could not, of course, be public cross-examination on future defence deployments and their consequences to which,once begun, no limit could be set.13. The balance of argument, in the view of the President of theBoard of Trade, is in favour of referring the whole matter (i. e, the location of the third London Airport) to an independent Committee.*NOTE. It is estimated that it would take from 1^- to 3 years forthe Committee to hear and sift evidence regarding the varioussites and prepare its report, and for the Government toconsider and reach its decision.    If Stansted were chosendetailed planning and land acquisition (some of which could bedone concurrently) could probably be completed in IJLxSi^i!and construction in a further 2jr years.    An inland site, otherthan Stansted, would take an additional 2 years planning and construction; an   estuarial site would require an additional3^j^ears.    Allowing for Parliamentary procedures after theGovernments decision (preparation and laying of the  SDO andpossibly a debate) Stansted could be brought into operation bythe beginning of 1974.    This date could not be met if the inquirytook longer than 18 months.    If a site other than Stansted werechosen, an additional local public inquiry would be required forwhich a further 6 to 12 months should be allowed.-5-COM .FJDSMTJAL
14.     In the view of the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentthe cost/benefit study has not shown any convincing alternative toStansted.    Nuthampstead has emerged as possibly the best of the alternatives because of its superiority on grounds of noise, but thisadvantage can be matched by re-aligning the runway at Stansted.The planning consequences of Nuthampstead are no more welcome thanthose of Stansted.    He therefore considers that there is not asufficient choice of alternatives to make a further investigation of themworthwhile.c p :^CLJJSION15.     We invite the Cabinet to consider and decide between thefollowing courses of action:-(a) Delaying the SDO for upwards of two months in order toconsider runway re-alignment at Stansted (paragraph 6).(b) An independent inquiry into sites in the general area ofStansted only (including Nuthampstead) ( paragraph 8),(c) Further interdepartmental consideration of the third london airport question (paragraph 10).(d) A major public inquiry without restriction on sites to beconsidered (paragraph 13).Or, of course, proceeding at once with the development of Stanstedas at present planned.C.

APPENDIX A  0The Third London Airport:  Cost-Benefit AnalysisReport of a Working Group (Revised 27/10/67)introduction.      Following the June 29th debate in the House of Commons on national Airport Policy,  the Board of Trade in three weeks con-ducted a cost-benefit study of the third London airport decision,to sec whether prima facie&apos; the conclusion from it would supportthe Stansted decision.    At this stage no other Government Dcpart-ment was consulted.    Although from this analysis Stansted was stillamong the best sites, there did not seem to be a clear andunmistakable net advantage in its favour.2.    As a result of a meeting of Ministers on September 27th a working Group was set up, under Board of Trade chairmanship,  to check over and if necessary revise this cost-benefit study.    Thefollowing Departments participated: Treasury, Defence, Transport,Department of Economic Affairs, Housing and Board of Trade.    TheReport of this Group (dated October 17th) has subsequently beenradically revised in the light of discussion with the british airports Authority about likely airport costs.Nature of the Cost-Benefit Analysis3.      Cost-benefit analysis is a way of setting out the full range of relevant economic factors which need to be taken into account in making certain kinds of choice.    These may be divided into(a) public sector paying out costs or benefits,  (b) other payingout costs or benefits incurred by individuals or companies, and(c) notional costs or benefits, which involve the attempt to expressin money terms such factors as inconvience or the reduction ofsatisfaction if some benefit were no longer available.4*      The analysis involved the attempt to estimate in money terms the most probable surface transport costs and benefits (capitalexpenditures, journey costs of airport traffic,  and the indirectcosts and benefits to other users of the transport system), themost likely cost and timing of airport construction expenditures,air traffic costs (due to the diversion of air routes which wouldbe caused at some sites,  to the different air distances travelledaccording to aircraft destination or origin and the location of the airport, and to the interference of the third London airport withother airports - as at Foulness, which would close down Southendairport), defence costs, the benefits from being able to reduce unemployment (at the Foulness and Sheppey sites), amenity andnoise costs (categorised into nine separate amenity considerations),agriculture, and new town economies (which proved not. to bequantifiable).5. .    Costs and benefits were attributed to the particular years inwhich they were expected to be incurred, and the totals in eachyear were discounted back to a common base year (1970) andaggregated.The sites chosen for comparison with Stansted were Sheppeyand Foulness, being the two most favoured estuarial sites,Silverstone, Cranfield and Bedford Thurleigh, being threerepresentative sites on the London-Birmingham axis, Nuthampstead -a green field site north-west of Stansted itself, being about 7-8miles further from London, and (subsequently) Stansted 2, beingthe original Stansted (renamed Stansted l) site with the runwaysre-aligned to reduce the amenity - costs .1
2Conclusions of the Working group.     On the basis of the costs and benefits which could beestimated, as summarised in table 1 at the end of this report,Stansted 1 and Stansted 2 appeared to attract the lowest netcosts and were not significantly different from each other.Nuthampstead was about 15% more costly than Stansted 2, and about17% above Stansted 1;  it is probable that these differences weresignificant given the margins of error to be expected in this study; it is at least very unlikely that with further and more detailed enquiry Nuthampstead would emerge with significantlylower costs than Stansted 1 (there are some greater uncertaintiesabout Stansted 2).    Foulness and Bedford Thurleigh came next withcosts about 45% higher than Stansted 1, and other sites attractedsignificantly higher figures.    (The above results include the expected costs of delay; because the importance of this factorsome further discussion is included in the Annex).2.     The close comparison in identifiable cost between Stansted 1and Stansted 2 arises because Stansted 2 involves higher construc-tion costs (mainly the abandonment of the existing runway) and lower amenity costs than at the original Stansted 1 site.3.     The principal disadvantage of Nuthampstead compared with theStansted 2 site is its higher surface transport cost;  comparedwith Stansted 1, Nuthampstead is more costly on airport constructicand surface transport costs, but is less costly on amenity.(Nuthampstead, as distinct from the Stansted sites, would closedown Luton airport, which has been taken into account.).4.     The amenity differences are based on the calculation that at stansted 1 there are about 103,600 persons at present living withirthe estimated 40 N.N.I.  (Noise and Number Index) contour line,compared with 20,500 at Stansted 2 and about 17,600 persons atNuthampstead. Accompanying these large differences in population are differences in the number of schools, hospitals and other buildings and facilities which would be affected.    In terms ofunidentifiable amenity cost, Stansted has about three times the acreage of parks and woodland compared with Nuthampstead, whileFoulness might be preferable because over 90% of the area affectedis sea or uninhabited marshland.    (Since particular importance isattached to the evaluation of amenity costs at the various sitesa rather more full discussion of this aspect than of the other factors is included in the Annex).5.     Another way or expressing the findings would be to leaveamenity costs out of the totals and to say that the amenity costsat Stansted 1 would have to be evaluated at least  8 m. more thanat Stansted 2 to make the runway re-alignment worthwhile.    If thisamenity cost were attributed on the basis of the number of people who would be within the 40 N.N.I. contour,  this would be the equivalent in the case of Stansted 2 of evaluating amenity at  96per capita and about  300 per dwelling house.    On a per capita basithis compares with an evaluation of amenity of about  80 in thecost-benefit study (all figures being in 1970 present value terms)In the case of Nuthampstead the equivalent value of amenity wouldbe about  230 per capita and  700 per dwelling house.    In the:caseof Bedford Thurleigh and Foulness these figures would rise to abou 500 per capita.    (But,if, of course,  amenity were valued at  500per capita,  it would not follow that Foulness necessarily wouldbecome the least cost site.)6.     The public sector cash flows (discounted to 1970) appear tobe about 12% higher at Nuthampstead than at Stansted 1, withStansted 2 in between.  This overall margin of difference, while thebest estimate which can be made^ in the limited time available, isprobably not statistically significant.
7.     On present information, the British Airports Authority expect that the developments at Stansted 1 will pay for themselves inthe long run, and that landing fees would not need to be increased on this account.    They will, however, require continuing exchequer loans in the early years to finance this investment.    No detailed examination has yet been undertaken by the B.A.A.  since no immediate expenditure undertakings will be required.8.     In the extremely limited time available for this analysismany approximations and estimates have been involved.    In generalmuch better information is available about Stansted 1 than aboutthe other sites.    The British airports Authority do not considerthat their estimates can be taken as reliable to within i 10% and surface transport costs cannot be guaranteed within that margin of error either.    Defence and amenity costs are also subject to possible errors of at least - 10?*.    The identified costs atNuthampstead appear to be of the order of 13% above those at stansted 2 and 17% above Stanstedl;  these differences are probablylarge enough to be significant.3

Notes on Summary Table 1Note that the assumed dates of operation are not the samefor all sites.    These are reasonable expectations based onthe likely delays which would be involved.   According tothe British Airports Authority, it is likely that a &quot;greenfield&apos; inland site of one runway could be ready to receiveaircraft by 1975 (three years from the start of construction)with the second runway by 197 6 and an estuarial site by 1977(five years from the start of construction).It is possible that this figure may be increased by about 4 m. if rephasing of construction is necessary to provide2 runways by 1974.Thurleigh is slightly cheaper to construct because ofexisting facilities, whose suitability for passenger services is as yet unknown.    To allow for this the figure providedby B.A.A. for inland sites was reduced by  2 m. at presentvalues, but it may prove cheaper to build if the existing facilities prove suitable.This is a minimum figure. In fact it would be much larger ifas is possible, the rail tunnels in the Medway towns had to bduplicated (see Annex on Surface Transport Costs).Utilisation because of cross winds would be reduced from99.6% to about 99.2%.    This may have serious implications anda considerable but non-calculable penalty could be incurred.The Ministry of Defence have given firm minimum figures and possible maximum figures for Stanstead, Nuthampstead, andBedford Thurleigh.    The risk of the firm minimum being exceedare rather higher at Bedford Thurleigh than at the other twosites.    Firm &quot;most probable&apos; figures, were given for theremaining sites.    In this tablo^the firm minimum and the&apos;most probable1 figures have been used (see also Annex, whereit is pointed out that the dislocation which would be causedif either Silverstone or Cranfield were chosen would be unacceptable to the Ministry of Defence),These are the minimum present values at the various sitescompared with Stansted which must be attached to noise andamenity to swing the balance against Stansted,    For another way of presenting these values, see number 5 in the&quot;conclusions  above.5

confidential.   Amenity and NoisePrinciples1.   Specific measures of the loss to amenity in each site, if the airport were located there, were estimated separately in money termsEn the following categories:    dwelling houses, schools, hospitals,other public and commercial buildings, golf courses, motor race   tracks(relevant only to the Silverstone site), sea-side resorts (relevantonly to Sheppey and Foulness), and gliding.2.     The basis of evaluation were the facilities listed above whichwould be included within the 40 N.N.I. noise contour (the same contourconfiguration was used for each site), with the exception of &apos;gliding&apos;.For some purposes facilities within higher noise contours were costedmore highly.     The general principle followed was to try to estimate the minimum cost to the community, whether this involved soundproofing,re-providing the facility elsewhere, or having to do without itpartially or wholly.       Thus the minimum cost attributable to the virtual loss of Bishop&apos;s Stortford Golf Course (which would lie withinthe 50-60 N.N.I. noise contour - the Committee on the Problem of Noise(Cmnd. 2056, 1963) thought that this represented an &quot;unreasonablelevel&apos;) would be assessed at the cost of purchasing an assumed 50 acres of land in a comparable area away from the noise and converting it toa golf course (net of the selling value of the existing golf course and facilities).3.     The costs were attributed to the period in time when they were thought likely to be incurred.     The estimated money values werediscounted back to 1970   in order to be comparable with the other data.4.     The largest amenity costs were based on the number of people who would live within the assumed 40 N.N.I. contours, as shown inTable 3.     Stansted with 103,600 people is significantly greaterthan any other site;    Silverstone and   Nuthampstead have the smallestpopulation which would be affected, with 15,500 and 17,600 peoplerespectively.     These figures were used to estimate the number ofdwelling houses, and hence the costs of soundproofing and amenity at each   site.    (As explained below they are based on a   two runwayairport.)TABLE 3APPROXIMATE POPULATION RESIDENT IN AIRPORT ENVIRONS AT THE VARIOUSSITES &apos; ^ &apos; ^Inside the	Within	55 N.N.I.	45 N.N.I.

The sum of  300 per house was used for houses within the 45-55 NNIcontours and of  500 per house within the 55h- range (the figure of 300 was based on the actual cost of soundproofing, thought to be ofjpe order of  200-E220, plus the discounted cost of &quot;getting away from
[it all&apos; more often than would occur in the absence of aircraft noise,(subject to the maximum of  300 which is the estimated cost of &apos;gettingfaway from it all1 for good - i.e. moving from the district).    Houses&quot;estimated to be inside the airport perimeter were valued at their full replacement cost (assumed to be  3,500).     Estimates were alsobade of the cost of soundproofing a certain proportion of schools,jhospitals, public and commercial buildings.16.     These calculations resulted in amenity costs (in 1970 presentlvalues) shown in Table 4, distributed over the appropriate years of(operation.TABLE 4Amenity Cost Estimates	  m.

Some progress was made with consideration of the areas as aI whole, considered separately from the particular amenity characteris-. tics&apos;.     As an alternative method of describing the different sitesthis approach was thought to have some merit.     Table 5 shows the approximate areas, in square kilometres, which would lie beneaththe 45 N.N.I. contour lines classified according to built-up areas(villages and urban areas), parks and woodland, agricultural andindustrial areas, uninhabited marshland and open sea. &apos;&apos;The large areas at Foulness and Sheppey which are eitheruninhabited (or practically so) marshland or open sea are notable,as well as the relatively high proportions of parks and woodlands atSilverstone and Stansted.

The reasons for thinking that the amenity costs may have beenunderstated are as follows:-(l)   The N.N.I. contours could underestimate the noise levels likelyto be generated by the Concord and the Boeing 2707 supersonic aircraftbecause the Concord now seems likely to be noisier than it did whenthe assumptions underlying the contours were decided.(2)    No estimates could be made of the costs to the Community for those people who live within the area covered by the 35-40 N.N.I.contours (more work would need to be done in determining the positionof the 35 N.N.I. line than was possible in the time available).     At35 N.N.I. considerable disturbance from aircraft noise would still be caused.       According to the Committee on the Problem of Noise page 210,at 35 N.N.I. approximately 30% of people reported that the noise&quot;disturbed rest or relaxation&quot; about 45% reported that the noise&quot;interfered with conversation&quot;, and 6 other types of disturbance were reported from about the same percentage of the population at thatnoise level.     Applying the principle &quot;how much would you beprepared to pay per annum not to be disturbed by this level of noisenuisance?&quot; costs above zero would almost certainly be recorded.(3)    Schools and hospitals have been included in their estimatedcost of soundproofing, but soundproofing is not wholly satisfactory and probably understates the true costs to the community.     Subjectssuch as music and drama indoors and outdoor sports become moredifficult to practice and to teach if there is intermittant nuisancefrom aircraft noise.     Noise in hospitals can be especiallydistressing.     In the absence of research into these matters noestimates can be made of the true costs involved.      (it may be relevant to note that Alexandra Hospital of 270 beds in Harlow NewTown, which was built about 3-4 years ago without soundproofing,lies within the estimated 40-45 N.N.I. contour for Stansted 1 butnot for the Stansted 2 site.)(4)   No cost differentials have been included for the general areacharacteristics which would be affected by noise (as described inTable 5 above).     Thus if Stansted has approximately 14 sq. Km. ofparks and woodlands which would be under the 45 N.N.I. noise contour(including some Green Belt land and 1,000 acres of National Trust3TABLE 5
Iforest), while Nuthampstead would have only about 5 sq. Km. (with noifereen Belt land), and the Foulness site would have over 90% open sealand almost uninhabited marshland under the same noise contour, then[t would seem appropriate that some cost ought to be debited tofstansted compared with the other sites.     Moreover, the number ofwildings of architectural merit and fine churches would seem to benuch greater at Stansted than at these other two sites, and againftheir value (net of doubt-counting with earlier calculations) isiot zero.LO.     The principal reasons for thinlcingtthat the amenity figureslave been overstated are as follows :-l(l)   Research is being intensified into methods of reducing the noiseProm jet engines.     When international agreement has been reachedfthe Noise Certification Scheme should result in some reductions inaoise levels below what they would otherwise have been.1(2)   The N.N.I. noise contours, which are only approximations, relateto a Standard Bwsy Rate (SoB.Ro) of 64 aircraft movements per hour,out this rate will not be achieved until some time after the secondrunway is operational, in the mid-1980&apos;s.      (But it is expected thatEventually the airport will achieve an S.BoR. in excess of 120iircraft movements per hour;    the extra flights would take place fromthe twin runways built alongside each of the first two0 )I (3)   The development of short take-off aircraft may in time change the shape of the N.N.I. contours, resulting in less intensive take-offrand landing noise at more distant points from the runway.LI.     It would generally be the case,  if it is thought that thefamenity costs have been underst ated in the study, that the positionpf Stansted 1 would tend to become less favourable compared with the)ther sites, while overstatement would tend to favour location at&quot;Stansted 1.2.

Stansted 113.     It has been assumed that by 1974 the existing runway will beextended and the second runway will be in service;    that passengerterminal capacity can become operational in three instalments in1974, 1977 and 1982;    that expenditures on infra-structure (internalroads, drainage, power sub-stations, etc.) will be undertaken before1974, and that small expenditures on infra-structure will benecessary also in the late 1970&apos;s.      If the second runway were notneeded until 1976, construction costs (in present value terms) wouldbe reduced by about  1.3m.Stansted 214.     It has been assumed that the present runway will remain inoperation until 1976 with some small interim facilities, and that two new runways will be constructed to the east, one enteringservice in 1974, the other in 1976 when the present runway would be scrapped.      Terminal buildings and utilities would be phased as before.      If the second runway were required by 1974 and constructionhad to be re-phased, costs might rise by about  4 m.Sheppey and Foulness15.      It has been assumed that the major work would start in 1972following a period of l-g--2 years for ground stabilisation.     Thefirst runway could not be in service before 1977, with the secondrunway one year later.      The total costs  (non-discounted) are 12m. greater than the cost of an inland &apos;green field&apos; site due to 15 m. cost of stabilisation, offset by  1 m. less expenditure on land and the deferment of some expenditure to 1982.Silverstone, Cranfield and Nuthampstead16.     On the assumption that construction work could begin in 1972the first runway could be available by 1975, the second by 1976, andthe first terminal by 1975.      The costs (non-discounted) are  16 m.greater than Stanstecl due to the cost of the first runway and fromconcentrating construction into a shorter period.Bedford Thurleigh17.     The cost is essentially the same as the last three sites,reduced because a runway already exists (whose suitability for passenger services is unknown).       3 m.  is allowed for this at1970 values, but the credit would be higher if the existing facilities prove suitable.3.    Surface Transport Costs18.     An attempt was made to evaluate the full social costs and benefits incurred in transporting passengers and goods between theirorigin or destination in the United Kingdom and the third london airport in each site.     These comprised (l) the journey costs ofairport traffic, making allowance for the disutility of additionaltravelling time;    (2) capital expenditure, including bringingprojects forward in time and initiating new projects as a consequenceof the airport location;    and (3) the indirect costs and benefits to other users of the transport system, including the costs of increased congestion which arise from the addition of airport traffic,and the benefits which non-airport traffic would obtain from capital expenditure.19.    The capital cost of providing road and rail links to the airport was the largest item.      &quot;Standard travelling costs&apos;, theadditional social cost of travelling to or from a site further fromthe journey&apos;s origin or destination than Stansted, both the cost6
of the journey and the cost of the time taken, were also found to be considerable.     Congestion costs and benefits proved to be rathersmall.     An allowance has been made for road investment affected inmore distant years by the existence of airport traffic, but such estimates were highly speculative.       The figures contained inTable 7 are the best the Ministry of Transport has been able to provide in the time available;    their accuracy cannot in any way be guaranteed.The figures for Stansted are more reliable than the others.20.     The Sheppey road and rail links would involve not only a spurto the island but also extensive engineering works on the railway line from the Medway towns to London.      If it were necessary inaddition to duplicate the tunnels through the Medway towns, thepresent value figure for the surface transport to the Sheppey site of  27.5 m. could increase to over  40 m.     Foulness also would require costly transport links to the island.      Silverstone,I Cranfield and Bedford are all very far from London, and though thetransport links may not prove expensive &quot;standard travelling costs&apos;I are high.     Nuthampstead has similar characteristics to Stanstedexcept that additional road and rail spurs costing about  7 m.I (present value terms) would be necessary.TABLE 7I SUMMARY OF SURFACE TRANSPORT COSTS  (AT 1970 PRESENT VALUES)  millionStansted 1 - 6Stansted 2 - 7Sheppey - 27 to    - 40Foulness - 20Silverstone - 22Cranfield - 12Bedford Thurleigh - 19Nuthampstead - 154.    Defence21.     The Ministry of Defence have checked carefully all theirj   previous estimates given to the Peterson Committee, and have providedI   the following information in the light of current deployment plans.22.     The figures are the estimated costs of adapting other R.A.F.stations to    take the tasks which would be displaced or, where thisI is not possible, the provision   of new airfields.      Adaptations arecos ted at  1 m. each, and the provision of new airfields at  12 m.:each.     Ten per cent has been added to the figure given below to1 take some account of the cost of providing married quarters,telecommunications, movement of personnel and equipment, and the consequential deployments from airfields to be adapted.      Twentyper cent has been added for M.P.B.V7. overheads;    but no allowance has been made for the cost of acquiring land where this would prove to be unavoidable, and no provision has been included for theinescapable costs of disruption.1 Stansted 1 and 223.    A firm minimum figure for the two closures concerned is  2 m., There is a risk that the figure might increase to  14 m. if one airfield which undoubtedly would be affected had to be resited.The expenditure would be spread over 2-3 years, and Wethersfield; would become inoperative some time between 1972 and 1975.7
Nuthampstead24.      The same firm minimum figure is given as at Stansted of  2 m.,but there is a risk that the upper range could go as high as  38 m.if three of the airfields which would be affected had to be resited.The distribution of expenditure over time would be the same as at stansted.Cranfield and Silvers tone25.      Location at these sites would involve about the same costs( 48 m. and  49 m. respectively );    expenditures would have to bespread over the 4-5 years before 1976.      (These figures include 20 m. due to Brize Norton.)     But the dislocation caused if eithersite were chosen would be unacceptable to the Ministry of Defence.Thurleigh (Bedford)26.     The firm minimum cost is    given as  14 m. with some risk (onrather higher probability than at Nuthampstead) that the cost mightrise to  28 m., spread over 3-4 years.Foulness and Sheppey27.     The costs of closing all the facilities at Shoeburyness(including the A.W.R.E.) is estimated to be  15.2 m., on top ofwhich is the M.P.B.W. service charge of  3 m.    This differs fromother estimates because no figure is included for accommodation norfor the &apos;sea wall&apos;, which is thought to be specific to Foulness.Accommodation is excluded because, insofar as new houses would berequired at the alternative site for the firing range, the same number of houses would be released in the vicinity of Foulness.Thus there would be no net additional housing required (assuming that the barracks at Shoeburyness would be suitable for housing the airport construction workers or others).   An allowance has alsobeen made for expenditures on Shoeburyness facilities which wouldbe incurred in any event, whether or not the range had to be moved.28.     The Group were advised that there remains considerable uncertainty whether a new site could be found for the range.     after a 9 month search two possible areas have been identified, but theyhave not yet been verified as suitable.29.     If the airport location were at Sheppey, the defence costs of Shoeburyness are believed to be approximately  10 m., plus  2m.service charge by the M.P.B.W.      This is lower than the cost oflocation at Foulness because it is thought that some facilities at the Shoeburyness site could continue in operation.30,     Unemployment rates within journey-to-work distances of thepossible sites for the third London airport vary considerably.On average over the three year period 1964-1966 Stansted (andNuthampstead) had the lowest rates, 0.68 per cent each, and Sheppeyand Foulness had the highest rates, 2.38 and 2.03 per cent respectively.     Sheppey had the largest number of unemployed, asshown in Table 8 below.TABLE 8Unemployment, 1964-1966average %unemployedaverage averagelabour force     number of( &apos; 000)_unemployedStansted (1 and 2)SheppeyFoulnessSilvers toneCranfieldThurleighNuthamps tead0.682.382.030.720.720.760.6872.6 49481.9 1,94980.0 1,62523.5 16997.8 70492.0 69972.6 494Source:   Ministry of Labour- confidential
31.     Thus if the third London airport were located at Sheppey or at Foulness some of these unemployed would become gainfully employed and would contribute to the G.N.P. according to their wages paid.If the other workers who would be employed at the third london airport were drawn at random from the existing population in the same way at each site, then the benefit to the community would be thetotal wage bill of the labour formerly unemployed in these areas.It was assumed that since these workers had formerly been unemployedthey would be paid  1,000 per annum (less than the average wage atthe existing two London Airports,  1,439).     To allow for theunemployables, the calculation was based on the difference in average unemployment rates over the three years 1964-1966 betweenStansted and the other sites, applied to the total work force at each site.     The present value of the sum of fLiture contributions to the G.N.P. was estimated through an annuity calculation.32.   Foulness and Sheppey, however, have special features.     Ifthe airport were located at Foulness, some 2,400 workers at presentemployed, at Southend airport would be thrown out of work, becausethat airport could not continue in operation.       This would be a loss to the community, but on the reasonable assumption that allthe Southend airport workers would swiftly find alternative employment at the Foulness third London airport, this loss would be cancelled by an equal gain at about the same time, and thereforecan be ignored.33.   But if the location were at Sheppey perhaps not all of theSouthend airport workers would be willing to re-locate themselves at that site on the other side of the river Thames.      If only75% moved, and the remainder were unemployed, then the loss to theG.N.P. would be the wage bill of some 600 extra unemployed.6.    Housing and New Town Considerations34.     Housing and new town considerations are likely to be important in terms of the overall magnitudes of costs and benefits involvedin the study.     This arises because the absolute sums of money in new town development are very large (for instance/&apos; the estimated total capital expenditures involved in the new town proposed forStansted would be of the order of  225 m.),      But the evaluationof the likely costs or benefits in alternative sites remains to alarge extent elusive.     More fundamentally,  in the absence of the relevant policy decisions on the housing development required inrespect of alternative sites no reliable estimates are possible.Stansted 1 and 2, and Nuthampstead35.      If the third London airport were located at Stansted, it is envisaged that there would be a new town of 100,000 persons in thegeneral vicinity, although no site has yet been chosen.     No doubt the same would apply at Nuthampstead.Foulness and Sheppey36.     Although fewer additional houses would be required if the airport were located at Foulness compared with Stansted, because some unemployed potential workers are already housed in thevicinity, it is not thought that in fact there would be any savinginvolved in this.      Any reduction in the number of houses neededhere would be offset by an increase in the number needed elsewhere.Silvers tone and Bedford Thurleigh37.     If the airport were located at either site, the 100,000additional population to service-the airport could be resident inthe new towns at Milton Keyncs and Northampton, and in adjacentlisting towns, and a new town would no longer be required for this9
purpose.     There could be some overall advantage to the communityarising from this, as follows.     Because there are some economies of scale in building a large new town compared with a smaller one,to accommodate most of the third London airport population atMilton Keynes (planned to accommodate 225,000 persons by 1991)could be of some advantage if the rate of building at Milton Keynescould be accelerated to accommocLate the additional population inthe early years.      The benefit to the community would arise fromthe advantages of scale on the one hand and the different phasing of public expenditure on the other hand.      The Group are agreedthat the logic of this is sound, but there are some unsurmountabledifficulties involved in estimation.38.     Also it appears from the Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment Circular No. 36, 1967 &quot;Housing Standards;    Costs and subsidies-, that there are differences in building costs in different parts of the country.      The building costs which would be relevantin the Silverstone area, and in the areas around Northampton,V/ellingborough, and Rushden close to Bedford Thurleigh, are believed to be approximately 5% lower than would apply in the areaaround Stansted, Nuthampstead, Foulness and Sheppey.      This could result in some substantial differences in cost between the sites,but without closer study no   firm figures can be given.7.    Regional Planning Considerations39.     In the Peterson Committee the area to the north-west of london was examined because of its particular attractiveness from a regional planning aspect.     The principal advantages of Silverstonewere thought to be in the context of regional planning, and Cranfieldand Bedford would to an extent have the same attractions.      Theadvantages for regional planning are that development at a siteon the Birmingham-London axis would fit in with other planneddevelopments in the South-Bast region;     and. that they would assistparticularly in helping to provide the employment for planneddevelopment in the South-East as a whole.40.     On the first of these arguments the relevant considerations are the ability of a particular site to be fitted into specific new or expanded town developments both in relation to housing, servicefacilities and industry.     Thus to the extent that Silverstone orCranfield could be phased into the Milton Keynes development the airport would have a regional advantage.      The relative advantages of certain sites have been discussed earlier in the section on new Towns, and other planning costs and benefits are subsumed inthe transport section.     Also,  insofar as a site on the Birmingham-London axis would to a degree act as a &apos;Midlands Airport&apos;, traveltimes for Midland users would be relatively lower and there wouldbe a net gain if users in, say, Kent did not suffer offsettinglosses.41.     The argument relating to the provision of employment is morefinely   balanced.       On the one hand employment for a given numberof people will have to be provided at, for instance, Milton Keynes.An airport would directly provide employment for some of these and it might therefore be easier to reach the total employmenttarget sooner.      In addition firms which were considering a movemight go not to Milton Keynes but to a different area selected forplanned development.     On the other hand such firms might decide to make no move at all if they could not move to the particularplanned development they favoured (for instance if they insisted on going to Milton Keynes rather than Ipswich).42.     Thus the regional planning arguments favour sites whichvould benefit from and which would assist the major developmentsalready planned on the Birmingham-London axis.      Stansted andNuthampstead are much less attractive, as are the Thames Estuarysites to a lesser degree.     The judgements on this are subjective,however, and the quantifiable advantages of each site from the10
planning aspect largely appear elsewhere in the cost-benefit study.8.    Agriculture43.     An airport in any of the proposed locations would involve theloss of agricultural land, both for the airport itself and forrelated new town   facilities.      It is estimated that a two runwayairport would occupy some 3,600 acres of land, and that a fourrunway airport would take an extra 1,200 acres.44.   Wherever the third London Airport is located it will attracta population of the order of 100,000 people, who will be housedsomewhere in the general locality.     We assume that these people would have to be housed in any event, and for comparative purposesassume that they would live in a new town located on ratherpoor agricultural land (value  170).      If the population aittractedto a particular site near a new airport lived on agricultural landwith a value higher than this then the costs to the community ofthis extra population would be the differential cost of land inthat site compared with the hypothetical new town (assuming thenew town authorities would avoid housing developments on Grade 1agricultural land if that were possible).     On the basis ofexisting new towns we estimate that 100,000 people would requireof the order of 6,000 acres of land, net of land for industrial purposes which the airport itself would cater for.45.     An Inter-Departmental Working Group has recently examined and reported (Ministry of Agriculture dissenting) on the valuation of agricultural land for planning purposes.      Its conclusion was that for planning purposes the market value of land should beUsed, uplifted by 25%.      This is equivalent approximately tousing the stream of outputs (net of subsidies), assuming a 2%jrise in the relative prices of agricultural produce but alsoj adjusting for tax concessions.      This method of valuation is applied to the acreage required at the various London airportI sites.46.     At the Stansted sites and at Nuthampstead the fullj6,000 acres would be needed to house additional population.At Foulness, however, part of the labour force necessary to1 service the airport would be provided by the present employment at Southend, together totalling approximately 3,500 persons.Similarly at Sheppey unemployed workers would be employed at&quot;the airport and the net population intake would be smaller byaround 1,500.      At Silvers tone, Cranfield and Bedford, wehave assumed that since the population might be integratedinto the planned development in the area, the differentialicosts as outlined above are nil.47.     The land values used are current selling prices per acreof agricultural land in the relevant areas.      The values used are probably not fully representative but are as accurate as possible-with the available information.11
9.    Air Traffic Costs48.   There are four ways in which the volume and cost of air traffic would be affected according to the site chosen for thethird London airport.    First, if the airport were located anywhereother than at Stansted 1 or Stansted 2 there would be some delaybefore it could become operational.    (The costs of this are con-sidered briefly in the next section, and more extensively inAppendix C.)    Secondly, if the airport were located at Silverstone,Amber One and Amber Two air routes to the north-west would have tobe shifted, and this would impose a cost on all aircraft usingthese routes.    To a lesser degree this would also apply at theCranfield sice.    Thirdly, according to destination, flights to andfrom the third London airport would have to travel a greater orlesser distance according to its location.    Finally, if the airportI ye re located at Sheppey, Foulness, Cranfield or Silverstone therej would be some interference with the operation of other civil air-ports, due to air traffic control requirements.i&apos;49.   Costs under the latter three headings have been estimated andare included in the summary table as &quot;Air Traffic&quot;.10.    The Costs of Delayj 50.   Some estimates of the costs of delay have been incorporatedi in the first summary table attached to the main report.    Because: of the importance of issues relating to delay,  and because of the inherent complexities in making estimates, this is examinedseparately and at some length in Appendix C to the Submission.51.   The benefits of delay are in effect already incorporated inthe summary tables.    Thus if a certain capital expenditure involvedin airport construction were postponed from (say) 1974 to 1976due to the administrative processes of public hearings and compulsory purchase at a &quot;greenfield&apos;  site,  there would bea benefit to the community in the sense that some other projectcould then go ahead earlier.      The benefit of this is includedby discounting the capital expenditure (at 8%) back to 1970 fromU976 instead of from 1974, which has the effect of reducing itsI amount.     Likewise if the loss in amenity due to noise were to occur during a certain period after 1976 instead of after 1974,those who would be adversely affected receive a benefit due to dela;52,     The costs of delay in Appendix C and in the summary table[relate to the adverse effects on airline passengers, on the B.A.A.,;on the airlines and hence on the United Kingdom community as aI whole.153.   If more detailed enquiries and the development of air traffic: showed that in fact Stansted 1 or Stansted 2 should commenceI operations in 1976 rather than 1974,  the date which presentIforecasts suggest, then Expenditures in contracting the airportl;and its surface communication links would be delayed, and in termsI of 1970 present values this would tend to increase the advantageiof these sites.      The advantage to Stansted 1 and Stansted 2 due toipelay in incurring construction and other costs would just out-I;weigh the advantage to, say, Nuthampstead in not incurring theI Penalties of delay on airline passengers, etc., as identifiedpin Appendix C.11.    &quot;Public Sector&quot; Faying Out CostsI.:       The summary table of costs and benefits includes several-I items which are costs to the community but not to the Governmentt0r to local authorities. On amenity costs, for instance, a clear distinction must be made between the sums of money the Government
might be prepared to pay for soundproofing (which on theHeathrow precedent would be  100 per dwelling) and the assess-rnent of overall cost to the community due to noise which, althoughto some extent arbitrary, was an attempt to evaluate the amountof dis-benefit which the community would incur, using the yardstickof money.     Likewise the costs of extra congestion due toairport traffic are not in themselves paid by the public sector(except where the journey times of public servants may beaffected), although extra congestion may result in the bringing forward of, say, a road or rail improvement scheme which wouldinvolve public sector expenditure.55.    An attempt has been made to separate out from the cost-benefitSummary Table 1 those items which involve public sector expenditures;these are given in Summary Table 2.     Houses were included through-out at a soundproofing cost of  100 each.12.    Thurleigh (Bedford)56.     Bedford Thurleigh airport was considered by the PetersonCommittee as analternative to Silverstone on the Birmingham-London axis.      It was thought at that time that Silverstoneoffered advantages over Bedford Thurleigh, and their detailed consideration was therefore confined to Silverstone.57*     Thurleigh aerodrome is located five miles due north ofBedford, on a large plain 290 feet above sea level.     The area asa whole would appear to be suitable for major expansions as a third london airport.      At present the aerodrome is owned by the Ministryof Technology and operated as a research station, in association with the Royal Air Force.      It posssesses a long runway of 10,500feet (compared with 10,000 feet at Stansted).     The aerodrome is approximately ten miles by road from the A.1 which is to be improved to dual carriageway from there to London.      The roaddistance would be 63 miles to Victoria (61 when a link is built to the A.1).58.     We understand that if the Ministry of Technology vacatedthe aerodrome the cost of removal to an alternative site mightbe of the order of  6m.- 8.m.      There are test wind tunnelsapproximately 2 miles from the existing aerodrome, which it istlumght could continue to operate, but if this proved net to bepossible the cost of re-locating these might be of the order of 20m.13.    Nuthampstead59.    The Nuthampstead site is on undulating ground at between400&apos; and 450&apos; above sea level in an agricultural area of smalland scattered villages, due west of Saffron Waldon.     Theproposed runway alignment would be N.E.-S.W.      Part of the siteconsists of a   former airfield, now disused and of no value foraviation purposes.      It was chosen because a runway configurationin the Stansted area which avoided the considerable amenitycosts of the Stansted site itself seemed to have considerable advantage.     The British Airports Authority have inspected the site, and consider it prima facie suitable.60.     The site is close to the A.10, about 5 miles from theA. 11, and would be somewhat closer to the M.11 proposed extensionnorth of Bishop&apos;s Stortford.     It is also approximately 5 milesfrom the Cambridge-Liverpool Street main line.61.     On the particular runway alignment chosen at Nuthampsteadsome flights entering the glide in path from the north stackingarea might at certain times choose a route which would pass over13
Cambridge, at a height of 2-3,000 feet.      Since a majority offlights come from the South and East this may not be a largefactor, but if further attention is    given to the site thisshould be explored further.62.      It should also be noted that location at Nuthampsteadmight close down Luton airport, the estimated costs of whichhave been incorporated    in the study.     In relation to theother items in the account this would not be very significant;in reality much would depend upon the value of the airport inalternative uses, and being close to the city centre it wouldappear to have a high potential value.    (Flying operations are,of course, severely restricted by Heathrow in any event.)14
APPENDIX BComparison of Stansted. with present runway alignmentand Stansted with runways realigned by 25    ianticlockwise)Recent studies have shown that with a greater public expenditure the noise nuisance from a major airport at Stansted could be considerably reduced by realigning the runways.      A preliminaryanalysis has been attempted of the costs and benefits of this possibility both to the community at large and to the Exchequeralone.     The results are given in the following tables:-TABLE 1  - Cost/Benefit study		i1970 present values                m.

p  Notes to tables:1.     Air traffic costs: Realignment of the runways by 250 in ananticlockwise direction means that the airport would be more subjectto crosswinds than under the original proposal.      This is obviouslyL;;  a drawback;    but it has proved impossible to attach a cost to it.K with the existing alignment the airport would be usable on 99.5%of occasions during the year (so far as crosswinds are concerned),while with the new alignment the usability figure would fall to be 99.1% - a difference of about 35 hours in the year spread over anumber of occasions.     Met. Office statistics show that theexcessively high winds occur predominantly between October and march when the traffic levels are not at their highest and therewould normally be spare capacity for diverted traffic at Heathrowand Gatwick though there would be cost to airlines (repositioning)and inconvenience to passengers, especially outbound.      In any case,a change in alignment of as much as 25   may not prove on further study to be necessary to achieve the desired improvement in; amenity.2,     Acquisition of land:    In the debate on a national airportspolicy in the House on 29th June, Mr. Douglas Jay said that only ,800 acres, in addition to the B.A.A&apos;s present holding of 800 oddacres, would be required for the initial third London airportj j development;    this was the last public statement on the subject.If the new airport were to be based on a realignment of the runwayson the lines proposed, the additional acreage required might beincreased to as much as 4,000 acres - 1,200 acres more than thefigure mentioned in June and 900 acres more than would,  in fact, bef.4 required by the latest draft Special Development Order based on current plans. The British Airports Aithority might well in thesecircumstances, however, be able ultimately to release some of theirpresent 800 acre holding(though its use for secondary airportIIJ purposes is more likely).     This is not an important factor interms of cost;    but it might raise some political difficulty in therealignment scheme - especially as some of the hew land that would need to be acquired is land not previously threatened by acquisi-i tion.       On the other hand, the extra land would have been subjectH ;to very high noise levels under the original scheme, and its inclusion within the future airport boundary would improve theinhabitants&apos; prospects of obtaining reasonable compensation.3.     Noise certification:    The scheme of noise certification ofI 1 aircraft likely to be adopted by aircraft-manufacturing countries as a result of the 1965 International Conference on Aircraft NoiseI can be expected to result in a substantial &quot;mix&quot; of markedly quieter[   : aircraft by the 1980s, when traffic at Stansted Airport would bef  ; reaching the capacity of two runways.     The amenity costs of boththe alternative schemes for Stansted may, therefore, prove to have; been somewhat overpitched, in terms of 1970 values, thus reducingI i the absolute gain to amenity from realignment.4.     Night restrictions on jet flights:    Restrictions on night jetflights on the lines of those in force at Heathrow - amounting, of[ course, to a reduction in the night-time capacity of the airport -I I would almost certainly eventually be required at Stansted Airportif developed on the present runway alignment.     They might also beI \ required even with the new alignment because, as at all the&apos;i alternative sites,  an appreciable number of people would still bej affected by noise, although the number would be very much smallerI J tnan with the original Stansted proposal.     However, with the newalignment of runways, it is fair to assume that night jet restric-[     tions at Stansted would be imposed at a later date and always bei 1 less severe.     But it is impossible to make any evaluation of this factor at this stage.2
Costs of Delayintroduction1 .     The costs of delay depend upon the date on which a third london airport should &quot;be fully operational (including supportingterminal complex) and the date on which any airport other thanStansted could be available.2.     The former date depends upon the view taken of the capacity(as improved) of Heathrow and Gatwick to cater for traffic growth in the early 1970s and upon the estimates made of that growth.But it can be said with some confidence that 1973 is the earliest date and 1976 the latest date by which the third airport will be needed.3.     The latter date in turn depends upon the view of the time taken up by a public inquiry with wide terms of reference and byland acquisition, planning and construction on a virgin site(which might be a good inland site or a difficult estuarial site).However, the most likely range of dates on which a new airport,other than Stansted, could come into operation is 1975-1977.U.     If of course Stansted were selected either now or following afurther Public Inquiry lasting no longer than 18 months it couldbe ready by J\31h and there would be no significant  &apos;costs of delay&apos;.5.     If any other site were selected following a Public Inquiry(which in this event would be likely to occupy more than 18 months)the best conclusion that can be drawn from these two sets of datesis that London&apos;s airports would have to turn away one or two years&apos;traffic growth;    while on more extreme views the effect could be either more serious, or negligible.6.     Even those able to travel to and from London would have tobook inconveniently long ahead.   The inability to obtain seats at short notice could, rightly or wrongly, be expected to give rise toa considerable volume of complaint [cf. the situation when there isa marginal shortage of gas or electricity) possibly from business-men seeking to secure export business.7.     The growth of freight traffic might be interrupted;    while thiswould affect both, imports and exports to about the same extent,London&apos;s reputation as a centre for air freight may be damaged, and again there might be complaints about frustrated exports.8.     With facilities for travel deteriorating foreign - and perhapsBritish - firms might tend in the marginal case to favour acontinental rather than British location for new factories.9.     The ease and. speed of communications between the capital andthe development areas may be impaired.&quot;10.   A rationing of movements to and from London would entail inter-national difficulties and probably retaliation against British air-lines.   The relatively minor operation of restricting night jetmovements at Heathrow brings us annually closer to a rupture withthe Italian authorities.11.   While recognising the importance of these factors, they are difficult - if not impossible - to express in money terms.   However,other aspects of the costs of delay can be estimated if somesimplifying assumptions are made.    While it is believed that theestimates which follow offer a reasonable indication of the costs of delay, the nature of the assumptions suggests that the reliability of the results cannot be guaranteed. appendix C
An Estimate of Delay Costs12.    Simplifying assumptions must be made both about the behaviour of the airlines and of passengers during the period when traffic would be turned -away from London and in the ensuing years.   Weshall first assume that Heathrow and Gatwick can handle all traffic to the London area up to 31st December 197k (as also assumed in thePeterson Committee report. Table Lb S.Io/T0L0Ao(66)20) .   Secondlywe assume that a one runway airport would be sufficient to handle the additional traffic during the years immediately after theopening of the third London airport.    While the second runway isnecessary and will enhance the commercial attractions of the air-port its timing is not a factor to b-e considered in calculating the costs of delay.13.    Owing to uncertainties connected with the siting and construction of the third airport, no significant portion of the traffic can be expected to divert to Stansted or any other overflowairport until the new facility is available.    Therefore the traffic which must be turned away from London in 1975 and subsequent yearsuntil the new facility is ready must be considered lost.   However,traffic turned away at this time will be assumed to incur lossesfor a further five years after the new airport becomes available;a longer consequence is unlikely because of the known propensity of long term trends of this kind to re-assert themselves.1h0   We shall assume that there is a direct relation between the traffic which must be turned away during the busy summer periodsand the total traffic which will thereby be lost, for scheduled andcharter services which are rejected at such times will naturallytransfer some of their other business.    The following Table gives the approximate number of terminal passengers and aircraft movementswhich will be lost, based upon Board of Trade &quot;most probable&apos;estimates.Table 1Excess Passengers in London AreaAir TransportTerminal Passengers Movement&quot;&quot;&apos;       CoooT&quot; ( 1000)1975                              290 3.61976                          1,500 17.71977                          2,860 32.k15.   No discreet allowance will be made for possible increased loadfactors, which must be considered a distinct possibility becausefrustrated passengers may be able to re-adjust their journey plansat very small cost by filling up existing services.    It should benoted that passenger/plane ratios are expected to continue toincrease and the numbers of passengers handled at Heathrow andGatwick will continue to rise at an annual rate of over k%*   no allowance has been made for possible technological improvements in air traffic control at Heathrow and Gatwick to allow them to exceedtheir estimated full capacity.    It is assumed that no differentialpricing policy or other financial or operational incentives can bearranged by the B0A.A.  to restrict the unacceptable movements to domestic airlines and charters with predominantly U.K. passengerssince this element is small in relation to total airline costs.    Itis assumed that the U.K. passengers affected by the saturation willI . merely make alternative travel arrangements;    they will still travel and so will incur some additional costs.    The foreign passengersturned away are assumed to be tourists, since we may expect business and other passengers, who have come to England, to make alternative arrangements.    In 1965, according to the London Airport TrafficStudy, on average half of the terminal passengers were non-OAK.residents.    Similar proportions were found at Gatwick, and in the2
3absence of more recent evidence (notwithstanding the submission onthe BoAoAo concerning Trans-Atlantic supplementals, a newphenomenon whose long term continuance is uncertain) thisdistribution   will be assumed for the frustrated traffic160    Since in this study we calculate only the cost to the UKcommunity, the inconvenience costs of the foreign travellers willnot be included;    we are only interested in the loss of foreignearnings from these tourists.    The inconvenience cost to theBritish passenger will be considered by assuming that passengerswill find their way to another airport from which alternativeflights could be arranged, or alternatively that they will suffersome inconvenience by having to travel at a less satisfactorytime.   The admittedly somewhat extreme case where a passenger musttravel by train to Birmingham to catch a plane to Spain will beassumed typical.   Thus the additional cost will be the fare toBirmingham and the increased fare to Spain.    This rather extreme case is taken as &quot;normal1  so as to include the notional costs ofinconvenience and delay caused to other passengers in less extremecircumstances.    On this rather arbitrary basis the extra costs would be approximately  3 per passenger journey.17,   One of the main losses claimed by the B.A.A.  in the event oftraffic being turned away from London would be Worth Americantourists on 1 open-jaw&apos; tour itineraries, that is with the UK aseither the arrival or the departure point of anEuropean tour inwhich other countries are visited as well.    In 1965 almost 80% of american visitors to the UK undertook such itineraries.   Alsoslightly under half of all American visitors to Europe in 1965visited the UK.    It is not known whether the diversion of some ofthis type of tour traffic would cause American citizens not to visit the UK at all.18.   American visitors comprise about 36% of all visitors to the uk travelling by air.   Commonwealth citizens comprise about 12%,and presumably would still aim to visit this country even if theyhad to suffer a diversion;    this would also be largely true of the% who are from foreign countries outside Europe.    The remainingkk%, visitors from Ireland and the rest of Europe, will tend to usesurface transport and suffer some delay or will not visit the UK atall.   Bearing these factors in mind, and remembering that in manycases each visitor represents two terminal passenger movements (in and out), we shall assume - though this is admittedly an arbitraryassumption - that the UK losses the foreign exchange from two daysstay in this country for every frustrated non-UK terminal passenger.This suggests that at least one day is lost at the origin ortermination of the journey and another from the inconvenience of analtered journey.   Foreign visitors spend, on average  2.7 per day in the UK.    Of this 17% will be assumed to be the import content oftheir expenditure, so each lost terminal journey will be assumed to cost  I4.5.Table summary of Costs of Delay and Loss of Foreign EarningsUoKc Foreign 2 Days PerPassengers Inconvenience Passengers PassengerDiverted Cost Q  3 Lost (g  k..5(*ooo)^975              1U5 335 1^5 635^976              750 2,250 750 3,3751977           1 ,1+30 li,290 1 ,^30 6,43519.   No loss of foreign industrial investment in the UK will beassumed since, even if such investments were to be influenced by&quot;the temporary inconvenience of travelling to the UK, the cost wouldbe small.   No permanent loss of scheduled services is assumedbecause: &quot;&quot; --&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; &quot;
(a) London at present is a world air transport nodal point,because of its geographical position and because of itsattractions for business and pleasure;    these basicfactors which account for London&apos;s position are long term;(b) Given the uncertainty engendered by an upset in theStansted decision, foreign airlines are highly likely to direct their next round of expansion towards Paris orAmsterdam;    however, as soon as London has a new inter-national airport, as the B.A.A. have emphasised, it will attract at first a very large share of international air-lines expansion;(c) Airlines are commercial operators and do not make long-term decisions simply because the air traffic situation at London is difficult for a few years.20.   No significant loss of scheduled traffic before 1975 is assumed for the following reason.    Granted that there will be some small losses of traffic before 1975, we cannot possibly measurethem;   we have however assumed them to be included in the post-1975losses, which have been deliberately pitched high by the ratherunrealistic assumption that all additional scheduled traffic willbe lost.21.   The fact that net foreign exchange earnings from civilaviation have been static since 1962 implies that the growth inthe expenditure by UK airlines abroad and by UK residents onforeign airlines is balanced by the growth of expenditure by foreign airlines in the UK and by foreigners on UK airlines.    Thefollowing Table shows the proportions.Table 5Foreign BalancesCivil Aviation  M.1965 1966U.K. AirlinesDisbursement Overseas -   72 -   84Revenues etc. from foreigners 4- 1 25 4- 137Nett 4-   51 -f   53Overseas Air1inesDisbursements in D,K.Revenues from U.K.* 35-   63* 38-   68Nett28-   30Total (Nett) 4-    23 f    23-22.   The saturation of London will, we have assumed, cause theforeign airlines thus diverted not to come to England at all.Thus the overseas airlines figures will be reduced relatively, and since this is a net outflow it would be a gain to the balance ofpayments.    Set against this is the likely retaliation of foreign government on UK airlines as a result of the situation, and thefact that it will be in some cases uneconomic for UK airlines totransfer services from London to regional airports.    Some potentialUK flights therefore will inevitably be curtailed.   We may assume a relatively smaller effect on the foreign exchange earnings of UKairlines.    This account is in surplus and so a loss to the balanceof payments may be expected.   We suggest that in the absence ofprecise data and the relatively small size of the figures concerned,the effects, which may be positive or negative, are negligible.
23.   By 197U freight movements will still be a small minority oftotal aircraft movements, and their manner of operation would seemto imply that very small cost effects would be felt.The Likely Costs to the UK Aviation Sector2k,   The B.A.A. have emphasised the potential losses to their ownnet revenue, and to those of BEA and BOAC.    But from the standpointof the community, it seems that negligible losses would accrue tothe B.A.A.    This is because all that will happen in the event of a delay is that some expansion will be postponed.    Consequentlycapital, labour and other resources which otherwise would have beentaken up by the B.A0A.  would be released for alternative uses.Throughout this study wc have assumed complete substitutability of factors between different uses.    This is a quite reasonableassumption in the case of the B.A.A. because it is a rapidly growingindustry, so all that is involved is a temporary slowing down inthe rate of growth and no actual resources presently used would betransferred.    It would be wholly untenable to argue that the B0A,,A0could make more productive use of the factors which it will releaseif the third London airport is delayed, for one could equally argue that an alternative use may be also more productive.    In brief, itis incorrect to say that the B0A,A. will lose net revenue throughdelay and that this is a loss to the community;    the former may be true, but the community can thereby make alternative use of theresources so released025.   In the case of BEA, BOAC and the other UK airlines these assumptions may be less realistic because their capital is lumpyand must be ordered many years in advance.    Furthermore, given the competitive situation in civil aviation, they may be less in controlof their rate of expansion that would the B.A.A.    It is fair to saythat within the period of delay, the UK airlines may be forced to under-utilise their capital, and this will be our assumption.   Otherinputs may be quickly adjusted, again because this is an expandingindustry (for instance they would hire less additional labour duringthe period of delay) .    The ratio of the current, book value of theU.K. airlines&apos;  assets to terminal passengers handled by them atLondon is at present about  28 per passenger, and we shall assume that assets and passengers grow in stop over the relevant years.Assuming also that the loss of passengers at London will have an equivalent effect on all UK airlined operations, this ratio may beassumed to represent a fair measure of the capital involved whenLondon terminal passenger movements are forgone.   We shall also takea somewhat extreme assumption (not altogether consistent with someearlier ones) that all the frustrated passengers who would have beencarried by UK airlines arc totally lost to them.    This is because wecan safely assume that some passengers are lost, and that althoughothers will be carried by diverted services this would seem to involve an inefficient utilisation of the airlines&apos; resources.   Weshall also assume that the capital associated with this loss of passengers lies idle for the period of delay.   UK operators carrysome 60f0 of all London terminal passengers and would presumably have carried the same proportion of the &apos;frustrated&apos; passengers.    Thecapital assets associated with each of these lost passengers will beassumed not to earn its 8% per annum return.   When the third london airport opens we may assume that the UK airlines will quickly takeadvantage of it and restore their earning capacity.    This then canbe taken to be a measure of the loss borne by the UK airlines, inno way passed on by them to their passengers, because of trafficlost or diverted as a result of the delay.    This represents a costto the community, and is estimated in Table k below.&quot;5

To summarise5 the following costs and benefits have been identified and estimated, given the simplifying assumptionsexplained in the earlier paragraphs:-(i)    Loss of foreign exchange from overseas visitors:-There will be some before 1975 but it is not calcuable;a total loss during the years of saturation, anddeclining losses over the following five years;(ii)    Inconvenience to U.K. passengers:-Some before 1975 but not calculable;    total inconvenienceduring saturation;    none in succeeding years.(iii)    Loss of foreign exchange by U.K. airlines:-Not inconsiderable but balanced by:-(iv) benefit to balance of payments from loss of foreignairline services.(v)    Loss of nett earnings by B.A.A.:-Some but not significant.(vi)    Losses associated with U.K.  airlines:-small in the first year, but rising steeply in later years;(vii)    Loss to British economy as a result of adversecommercial decisions:-Nil.(viii)    Loss of freight revenues and effects on foreign trade:-Nil.27.    In Table 5 these costs have been assigned to the years inwhich they are expected to occur;    the losses from the reduction inthe number of foreign visitors are assumed to dwindle arithmeticallyduring the first five years of operation of the third London airport.28.   The dates of operation correspond to the forecast dates ofsaturation at Heathrow and Gatwick.    The fact that no costscalculated on the basis of the above assumptions are incurred untilsummer 1976 must not be taken to suggest that the airport need notbe ready sooner.    In order to escape these costs the third london airport would have to be fully operational, with many servicestransferred;, by the dates given.    Furthermore, because of theinflexibilities of operations at Heathrow and Gatwick as they
approach, saturation, some traffic will he turned away &quot;before 1976,even on the basis of the forecasts used here.    Ideally the newairport must be ready 18 months before it is absolutely necessary.In the event of it being ready later it could quite clearly be madefully operational more quickly, at a cost.    In addition to these factors are all those concerned with the uncertainties of the timenecessary for construction.    Thus it must be stressed that the costs calculated in this note are based upon a set of assumptions;but, granted that the assumptions are reasonable, they representthe best available guess.29.    It should be noted that the balance of payments costs (whichmight appear to involve double counting with UK airlines costs butin fact do not)  should more appropriately be expressed as the costin terms of domestic real resources which would be involved inturning the terms of trade against the UK in order to prevent the(admittedly small) deficit from emerging.    This would probably tendto reduce marginally the costs as recorded.The B.A.A.&apos;s view-----3G\    It is fair to add that the British Airports Authority assess the loss of foreign exchange earnings and loss of net revenue ofthe two Air Corporations as follows:-Balance of vayments1,11     &apos;    &apos;DiscountedActual to 1970LoA.Po3 available by1975 16 14&apos;  1976 hS 3k1977 9U ShLoss to Net Revenue ofAir Corporations1975 7 51976 20 141977 U1 28(Note:   Adding the above two figures together would involve somedouble-counting.)There may here be perhaps an understandable attempt to prove a case and on any view these figures are pitched on the high side:    forexample, there is a difference of methodology and the BoA0A0 havetaken extreme views on other traffic lost and on the way airlineswould react to impending congestion;    also they have calculated theloss to the nationalised sector of the civil aviation industry as distinct from that to the community as a whole.    Nevertheless it is evident that any assessment of the cost of delay is very sensitiveto estimates of traffic growth, and judgments on the likelybehaviour of foreign tourists and of airlines when air travel toand from London is restricted.7
