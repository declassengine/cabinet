[DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT)C(67) 196 COPY NO.15th December, 1967CABINET65RACE RELATIONS legislation memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentIntroductionOn 19th July, 1967, the Home Affairs Committee approved my predecessor&apos;s proposals to extend the Race Relations Act 1965 to employment, housing, insurance and credit facilities and to a wider range of public places.    The Governments intention to introduce anamending Bill this Session was announced in The Queen&apos;s Speech,Scope of the bill.       Since the Home Affairs Committee discussion, there havebeen extensive interdepartmental discussions at official level anda number of informal meetings between interested Ministers.    Inview of the controversial and novel nature of some of the proposals,I think it right to consult my colleagues et this stage about the scopeof the Bill.3.       I accordingly attach a summary of the provisions in Annex l,Their main effect would be:-(a) To make discrimination on the grounds of colour, race, ethnicor national origin unlawful in places which are open to the public at large or in the provision of services which are available to the public at large.(b) To make discrimination by an employer or a trade union unlawful.Domestic employment in a private household and, initially, employment by employers with ten or less employees, will be exempt.    A special provision will enable an employer to refuse temporarily to recruitemployees of a particular race for the purpose of preserving a balance between different racial groups.(c) To make discrimination in disposing of a house or other propertyunlawful.    The Bill will apply to all local authority housing, to thosewho make a business of selling and letting property and to the privateowner-occupier, with certain exemptions for shared accommodation and lodgings,(d) To make discrimination in the provision of insurance and credit facilities unlawful, with certain safeguards for the exercise of commercial judgment,
(e) To make all discriminatory advertisements unlawful,,(f) To make special provision in the field of employment for industryto establish its own voluntary machinery to attempt conciliation in thefirst instance,(g) To strengthen the role and status of the Race Relations Boardand to empower it to seek injunctions or damages in specially designatedcounty courts sitting with assessors in England and Wales (with corresponding arrangements in Scotland),(h) To bind the Crown, with appropriate exceptions,,(i) To replace the National Committee for Commonwealth Immigrantsby a statutory board.Enforcement4,       Many of the provisions set out in Annex I will be difficult toenforce.    But the enforcement of sanctions is not the primary aim off legislation in the delicate field of race relations.    Its main purpose is more general: to proclaim that racial discrimination is not in thepublic interest and that the Government are opposed to it on grounds of public policy;  to educate public opinion;  to lend support to thosewho do not want to discriminate but are under pressure from others to do so   and to make available effective conciliation machinery.5.       To achieve these aims the legislation must be as comprehensiveas possible.    If we avoid the central issues because they are sensitiveand controversial, many people including the coloured communitiesthemselves, will doubt our sincerity.     We shall then have the v/orstof both worlds.6,       I consider that most complaints of discrimination under the bill will be settled by conciliation and that few of them will reach the courts.There will, however, be some cases where conciliation fails and wherethere is clear evidence of discrimination, perhaps accompanied by financial loss.    For them a remedy should be available in the courts,both as a matter of justice and as an ultimate sanction to give thenecessary backing to the conciliation procedures of the Race relations board and industry.7.       The enforcement arrangements I am proposing differ from those under the existing Act.    Discrimination will be defined to include a singleact, and not only a course of conduct,    The power to seek an injunctionin the courts, which at present rests with the Attorney &quot;General inEngland and Wales, would instead rest with the Race Relations Boarditself which would be empowered to seek both injunctions and damageson behalf of complainants in specially designated county courts sittingwith assessors.    Individual plaintiffs would not be able to instituteproceedings before the courts.    The county court limit on damageswould not apply.    I hope it will be possible to make comparablearrangements in Scotland.
The Private Owner-occupier80       Probably the most difficult and controversial issue is the proposalto include the sale of a house by a private owner-occupier in the provisionsof the Bill, and it is in respect of this that I seek my colleagues&apos; views.This will be attacked by those who will consider it unacceptable to restrict the right of an individual to dispose of his private property as he wishes.,They will argue that people can have good reasons for deciding not toaccept a particular offer for their house and tha.t such people may feelthat they will at the least attract adverse publicity, if nothing worse,in refusing an offer from a coloured person.   It will be said that thelegislation is entering the field of private and personal transactions and moving away from overt and public conduct, that the privatecitizen will be required to satisfy an outside body about a privatetransaction, that injunction procedures will seldom be effective andthat damages will be difficult to quantify,9.       On the other hand, there is widespread agreement that thequestion of housing sales is the touchstone against which our genuinenessin the field of race relations will be tested.    About 50 per cent of allaccommodation is owner-occupied and it is this type of property thatthe coloured communities most want.    A big threat to community relations is the development of residential ghetto areas occupiednot only by new immigrants but also by second generation colouredcitizens of this country.    Any measure we can take to prevent this development or to make it easier for those already in segregated areasof bad housing to move elsewhere will be valuable.    Since most peopleobey the law, the inclusion of private housing in the new legislation wouldbe an important contribution.    I therefore propose that it should beincluded.The Crown10. .     I think it essential presentationally and politically that the Crown,both as an employer and as the provider of public services, should beseen to be bound in the Bill.    There would be suitable safeguards for security and the nationality rules for the public services.    I would also propose to exclude the Crown from court proceedings though there will no doubt be pressure not to do so.Finance and Staff11.       Details of finance and staff are given in Annex II,Conclusion12.      I think the principal weakness of the legislation is that enforcementin the courts will usually be difficult? but against this, the legislationmust be comprehensive if it is to influence public opinion and must include a legal sanction if the procedures for conciliation are to have a chance to succeed.    It is against this background that I invite my colleagues to endorse the. proposals in the attached summary.h, jr. c.Home Office, S.W. 1.15th December, 1967

*It is proposed that the following undertakings should begiven during the passage of the Bill through Parliament:-(a) At least three members of the Board will haveexperience of industrial relations and will beappointed after consultation with the C.B.I.,  theT.U.C. and the Minister of Labour.(b) At least one member will have special knowledge oflocal authority housing and will be appointed afterconsultation with the Local Authority associations and the Minister of Housing.(c) The&apos;Home Secretary will ensure that the machineryof the Board is such that the members who deal withemployment and housing cases will include those withspecial experience of industrial relations and of, housing respectively.Race Relations Board and Procedure for Investigating Complaint20.   As under the present Act, the Race Relations Board willbe required to appoint such local conciliation committees asit considers necessary.      These committees will retain theirexisting functions in relation to all complaints of discrimination under the Bill other than those in employment.In addition the Board will be required to establish machinery which, in the opinion of the Home Secretary, will be competent to deal with cases which cannot be satisfactorily settled atthe local level either by the conciliation committees or inemployment cases, by appropriate voluntary conciliation machinery within industry .21.   The Board will be given powers:-(a) to direct a local conciliation committee as to whichcomplaints or classes of complaints other thancomplaints in employment it should deal with;(b) to perform conciliation functions on the same lines .as a local conciliation committee either(i)   where a conciliation committee or the voluntarymachinery within industry has failed to secure a settlement, or(ii)    where the Board itself decides to investigatea complaint other than a complaint in employment and has directed a conciliation committeeaccordingly;
(c) to make enquiries where it has reason to &quot;believethat discrimination is being practised (otherwise than on receipt of a specific complaint) and, whereit appears to the Board that discrimination hasoccurred,  to try to secure a settlement or toproceed, further as provided by the Bill;(d) to appoint assessors to assist it in the considerationof particular cases, such assessors to have specialknowledge and experience as appropriate of thecircumstances in which discrimination is alleged to have occurred and of relevant local circumstances.22.    Where the Board or a local conciliation committeereceives a - complaint of alleged, discrimination by an employer,a trade union, or an employers &apos; organisation,- it will be requiredto refer it to the Minister of Labour.     The Minister will consider whether there is,  in his opinion,  any suitablevoluntary conciliation machinery established by agreementbetween organisations of employers and organisations ofworkers which can appropriately consider the matter.     Ifsuch suitable machinery exists, the Minister will refer the complaint to it.      If no such machinery exists,  the minister will refer the case to the Board. &apos;- \v23-    The voluntary machinery will make such enquiries as itthinks necessary with respect to the facts alleged in the complaint,  and will endeavour to reach a settlement.     Ifit is unable to reach a settlement within four weeks of receiving the complaint Itself, or fails to reach agreement,it will report the facts to the Minister, at the same timeinforming him whether, in its opinion, discrimination withinthe terms of the Bill has taken place.2k.    On receiving this report from the voluntary machinerythe Minister of Labour will refer it to the Board.25.    Where in the opinion of the voluntary machinery therehas been no discrimination,  there will be no obligation on   .the Board to re-hoar the case,  and no automatic right for
the complainant to have his case re-heard.     Where, however,the complainant alleges to the Board that the voluntarymachinery had dealt inadequately with his complaint, either because it has not given him a fair hearing or because ithas reached a conclusion not justified by tho facto, it willbe open to the Board,  if it sees fit, to discuss tho case with the voluntary machinery, to refer the complaint bach tothem for further consideration,  or alternatively, to make &apos;its own investigations.     If, after receiving a further report from the voluntary machinery or after making its owninvestigations, the Board shares tho view that there has been no discrimination,  it will attempt to satisfy the complainantof this.      If he persists in his charge, the Board will tell him that the case is closed.26.   Where the voluntary machinery reports that it has been unable to reach agreement among itself or to reach a settlement,when in its opinion discrimination has occurred,  or whereafter further investigation (as provided for in pnrngi-aph 25above) the Board itself roaches this conclusion despite areport to tho contrary by the voluntary machinery,  the board will attempt to roach a settlement with the employer or tradeunion concerned.      If it fails it may take further action as appropriate under the provisions of the Bill.27.    Where the Board or a local conciliation committee receive a complaint of alleged discrimination by a private employmentagency, the Board will,  if the complaint does not appear to involve discrimination by an employer, deal with the complaintthrough its own machinery for handling employment cases.where the complaint appears to involve discrimination by an employer rather than by the agency,  the Board will refer the complaint to the Minister of Labour who will refer it to anysuitable voluntary machinery covering that employer.28.    If complaints are made direct to the Minister of Labourhe will refer them to any suitable voluntary machinery or,failing that,  to the Board.      If complaintc are made direct to the voluntary machinery they will be considered by it andthe outcome reported to the Minister.
Enforcement29.     In England and Wales, enforcement v/ill be throughdesignated County Courts, the presiding judges sittingwith two assessors selected from a panel appointed bythe Lord Chancellor.30.      Individual plaintiffs will not be able to instituteproceedings- before the designated Courts.      The power to doso v/ill lie solely with the Race Relations Board.     Where theBoard can establish that discrimination has occurred in contravention of the Bill it will be empowered to seek fromthe Courts an injunction to restrain further acts of discrimination or such other injunction as may in the opinionof the Courts, bo appropriate.      It v/ill also be empoweredto seek damages on behalf of someone against whom discriminationhas been established for provable loss directly resulting fromthe act of discrimination.31.      The designated Courts will have sole jurisdiction, withthe normal rights of appeal.      The County Court limit ondamages will not apply.32u     Comparable arrangements in Scotland will be necessary.Community Relations Board33.      The Home Secretary v/ill be empowered to appoint a community Relations Board to replace the National Committeefor Commonwealth Immigrants.      Its terms of reference will be(a)    to promote and co-ordinate on a national basisefforts to secure harmonious relations betweenpeople of different race,  colour or ethnic or national origin within the c iumunity and,in particular to(l) provide a comprehensive advisory service for local organisations concerned with communityre1at ions, and
i)    provide aninformation service, training courses and coi-- erences;to advise on questions referred to them by thenone Secretary andecommeridations to himon matters which they consider should be broughtto his attention, andto sake such grants to assist such local organisations concerned with race relations as the Home Secretarymay with the consent of the Treasury, approve.5k.    phe Board will have power, subject to the Home Secretary&apos;approval, to appoint such advisory bodies for such purposes has it considers necessary.&apos;.&apos;.&apos;he Crown53.    The Bill will bind the Crown except that it will not beopen to the Pace Relations Board to proceed against the Crownin the Courts.   The Bill will preserve the nationality rules for the Civil Service, the Diplomatic Service and the ArmedForbes and the Crown&apos;s discretion, in dealing with cases wheresecurity is involved;    and will provide special machinery fordealing with cases affecting the Public Services.Researchbo.    The Bill will provide that the Home Secretary may conductor assist other persons in conducting research into any matter connected with race relations and that any expenditure incurred with the consent of the Treasury will be defrayedout of moneys provided by Parliament.
FINANCE AMD STAFFIn his memorandum to the home Affairs Committee (H(67)7^)my predecessor estimated that the effect of his proposals would he to increase the staff of the Race Relations board to about eight officers at Headquarters,  13 conciliationofficers in the field and appropriate supporting staff,and that its current budget of  60,000 a year might rise toabout  1 50,000 -  175,000.     This is still the best estimatebut the Treasury have now agreed to carry out an 0 &amp; Menquiry into the future organisation of the Board to meet its new responsibilities and more precise figures shouldbe available in due course.    ^T-he Minister of Labourestimates that the proposals will not involve any increasein his departmental staff beyond those already engaged onrace relations work.      It is not possible at this stage to estimate the additional cost of the proposed enforcementprocedures through designated County Courts since thiswill depend on the number of cases coming to the Courts.
