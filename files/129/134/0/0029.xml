IIUS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYrS GOVERNMENT)C(67) 200 COPY NO.        jj 520th December, 1967DOCKS:   LONDON WEEKLY GUARANTEENote by the Minister of labour the Prices and Incomes Committee, v/ho considered the attached memorandum today, invited me to circulate it to the Cabinet, and, hiview of the urgency of the situation, to raise the matter at tomorrowrsmeeting.el. J. G.Ministry of Labour, S,W.la20th December, 1967
DOCKS:    LONDON VtEEKLY GUARANTEEMemorandum by the Minister of labour I seek my colleagues&apos; views as to whether or not we should attempt&quot; by reference to the National Board for Prices and Incomes and by a directionunder Section 15 of the Prices and Incomes Act, I966 - to delay further the implementation of the agreement reached last March for a weeklyguarantee for registered dock workers in London of  17 (now  16).background,     Last April., with the agreement of my colleagues (Pl(67)30), I informed the London Modernisation Committee that the Government could not approveimplementation of their local agreement reached in March for the indroductionon decasualisation of a  17 weekly guarantee in London since, in theGovernment&apos;s view, it went beyond the Devlin recommendations for a  15guarantee in other ports and negotiations on a suggested London differentialof  1.    I have re-affirmed this decision in the intervening period in replyto requests for reconsideration.3.     In view of this the London employers have, since decasualisation wasimplemented on 18th September, been voluntarily limiting the guarantee to 16, against mounting pressure from the unions both officially andunofficially for implementation of the agreed figure of  17.4.     Both the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union (t.G.W.U.) and theNational Amalgamated Stevedores and Dockers (N.aos.do) are now pressing for immediate implementation of the  17.   The union leadership see militancyon this issue as the only way to prevent a further damaging challenge totheir authority from the unofficial Liaison Committee, who have threatenedunofficial action if the agreement is not implemented by 1st January^.The to &amp; G.&apos;w.U. London Docks Committee have said that they will apply totheir union&apos;s General Executive Council for plenary powers.    In view ofthis the London employers have informed me that they intend to implement the agreement from 8th January..   This cannot be prevented except by useof the Government&apos;s statutory powers./5.  ..confidential(9/836)
5.     At national level the T. &amp; &amp;.Y/.U. are backing the demand for a  17guarantee in London.   They have included it in a claim recently presented to the National Association of Port Employers (N.A.P.E.) together withdemands for a  16 guarantee in other ports, and an increase to  15 in the basic minimum wage (now  11 Is. 8d. plus  2 modernisation payment).   TheN.A.P.E. are expected shortly to reject all these demands, hut they haveheen unable to dissuade, and have no power to prevent, the London emplc2rersfrom going ahead.Possible Courses of Action6.     The question for decision is whether we acquiesce in implementation of&apos;the agreement from 8th January, or whether we refer the issue to theNational Board for Prices and Incomes and give a direction under Section 15of the Prices and Incomes Act, I966 to delay implementation pending theBoard&apos;s report.7.     The main argument against reference to the Board and a direction isthat it could well be the signal for the liaison Committee, who stillcommand considerable support in London, to call for unofficial stoppagesor other disruptive action which would have a serious effect on exports and confidence.    If that happens, we cannot count on the support of theTo &amp; G.W.U.   Vie v/ould be faced with demands from the employers and thecountry generally to use the penal provisions of the Act against the unofficial strikers.   Any attempt to use these provisions might lead toextensions of the dispute to other docks and further disruption of the economy.8.     The alternative is to allow implementation of the agreement from8th January.   The arguments against this are the difficulty of justifyingit within the incomes policy, and the risk of repercussions and ofconsequential damage to the policy.   On a strict interpretation it isdifficult to accept that the agreement conforms to the white Paper criteria,though as a matter of presentation some justification might be found forthe agreement under the productivity criterion.   The difference between a 16 and  17 guarantee in London is estimated by the employers to add about 60,000 a year - i.e. about a quarter of one per cent - to the wages bill.They regard it as a necessary condition for securing the improvements in working practices which are being introduced.   The P.L.A. have given an assurance that it v/ould lead to no-  increase in charges and a similarassurance would need to be obtained from the other employers.     The riskof repercussions is greatest in Liverpool, though there too, in view of/the recent2(97836)
the recent pay settlement, the cost of raising the weekly guarantee fromthe present nominal  15 to  16 - or even to  17 if demands for parity with london are pressed - would he negligible, and should not result in increased charges.9.     More widely v/e must consider the bearing of our decision in this caseon other difficult incomes policy issues in other industries, e.g. busesand engineering, on which we will soon have to take decisions, and also on the T.G. 17.11&apos; s campaign for a  15 basic minimum wage in the docks and generally.Conclusion10,    The question for decision is whether we regard delaying implementation of this agreement as 30 crucial to incomes policy that v/e are prepared toaccept the risk of renewed disruption in the London and other docks.R.J.&amp;.Ministry of Labour,8, St. James&apos;s Square,LONDON, S.w.1.19th December, 19673(9^836)
