DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67) 197 COPY NO. 015th December, 1967CABINETTHEATRESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department on 27th November rny predecessor circulated a memorandum(C(67) 186) on the question whether the Theatres Bill should prohibit the representation of living persons in stage plays.    Since then:(a) Mr. Strauss, who will be bringing in the Bill with Governmenthelp, has indicated in emphatic terms his opposition to any such provision.    If the Government seek to move such a provision intothe Bill the ensuing controversy will endanger the Bill this Session,as the sponsor v/ould probably withdraw,(b) On the other hand I have discussed with the Lord Chamberlainwhether a general provision prohibiting the representation of livingpersons is needed if only for the purpose of protecting The Queen and members of the Royal Family.    He would like to see a generalprotection included in the Bill - but not one limited to The Gueenand the Royal Family.(c) Lord Goodman, to whose proposals reference was made inparagraph 2 of C(67) 186, has now produced a rough draft clause.It would prohibit the representation of living persons, whether by name or implication, unless the subject had consented, or unlessthe reference was an authentic quotation from a work already published in the United Kingdom in some other medium, or unless the reference was to the subjects public office or public activities,2.       Lord Goodrnanrs formulation does not satisfactorily solve thedifficulties, and if there is to be a provision about living persons Iwould prefer a simple, if arbitrary, provision which would solve .most of the problems, but not set out to solve all.    This could takeone of two forms :-(i) prohibition of the representation of a living person as a characterin a play, whether by name or by implication, without his consent;or(ii) prohibition of any reference, express or implied, in a play to a living person without his consent. Either could be extended toinclude persons recently dead as well as living persons.-1-
The latter is needed if we are to aim for complete protection, because a living person can be injured in a play without being represented as a character in it.    But so stern a prohibition would be open, to the criticism that the new law would be more restrictive than the old, and we could hardly contemplate it.    The main objection to (i), which is much lessextreme, is that it departs substantially from the principle, to whichthe Select Committee attached importance, that the lav/ should be thesame for plays and books.    Moreover, the inclusion of representationor reference by implication, although necessary, would lead to trialswhich would so much resemble trials of actions for defamation that inmy view it would be better to rely on defamation.3.      An alternative course is to make no provision prohibiting the representation of living persons, but to make defamation in a play aground for action for libel rather than for slander (as recommendedby the Select Committee).     This would remove the necessity for theplaintiff to prove that actual damage resulted to him from the presentation.If we follow the precedent of 1952, when defamation in broadcasting was treated as publication in a permanent form (and therefore a ground ofaction for libel rather than slander), defamation in a play will come within the field not only of civil but also of criminal libel0    This wouldprovide some protection, and without unduly restricting dramaticfreedom, as the defence of fair comment on a matter of public interest is available,4.       I have reached the conclusion that the difficulties of a provisionprohibiting the representation of living persons are such that we shouldnot try to persuade Mr, Strauss to accept one in the Bill as introduced a(Hfe would not do it anyway).    We should, however, take into account there actions of the House on Second Reading and if there is a general desireto include some provision to protect living persons we can censider thematter again.    For the present the Bill would simply make defamationin plays a ground of action for libel.    But Mr. Strauss will understandthat there is likely to be pressure for the adoption of some prohibitionof the representation of living persons, and he would be told that theGovernment are not to be taken as committed to rejecting this courseor some other means of dealing with the matter at a later stage of theBill.L. j .
