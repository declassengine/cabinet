It is issued for the personal use of...(S&amp;^*...Mftlswy^TOP secret copy NoC(67) 19313th December, 1967CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE,Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the economic situation remains extremely menacing.     the november trade figures were the worst we have ever had.     In partthis was due to dock disruption, but in part also it was due to an under-lying deterioration of export performance, which started in July and wasgathering momentum at least up to devaluation.2.      Revaluation, however, will not correct this situation in the short-term.    The reverse is indeed likely.     The deterioration in theterms of trade will bite more quickly than export orders will build up.Over the first half of 1968, we cannot therefore expect favourable tradefigures.3.      A reasonable pre-devaluation expectation was that we could becarried through this difficult period by the reflux of funds (and the consequent huild up of our reserves) which would follow from sterlingbecoming a cheap currency and London offering very high short-terminterest rates.    This has not happened.    Sterling is cheap but it hasnot become attractive.    And the effect of the 8 per cent bank rate isbeing more than nullified by the high forward premiums.     In the two weeks following devaluation we gained considerably less than we loston the Friday before it took place.    The massive losses of the rest ofNovember remain unrequited.    And since the beginning of this monthwe have again begun to lose reserves.4.      It is against this background that I put certain general public expenditure considerations before the Cabinet.     The Supply estimates for 1968-69 as submitted to the Treasury provide for an increase of11. 8 per cent above this year&apos;s figure.     Additional expenditure arisingftut of devaluation will certainly tip the increase over 12 per cent.    Inany event the rate of increase would still be substantially the highestsince that produced by the Korean War.     The 1963-64 increase, whichwas part of the bonanza producing the  800 million deficit, was the nearest rival with an increase of 9. 4 per cent.    Last year&apos;s figure,which, in apparently much easier circumstances, produced a chorus of criticism, was 8. 5 per cent.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.
5.      The announcement in February (when it would have to take place)of a projected increase of 12 per cent would in my view create a totallyuntenable situation both with internal and external opinion,.     this announcement would coincide with the next discussion with the IMF, and very likely also, in the absence of any measures to restore confidence,with the need to make a substantial drawing on the stand-by credit.    Inthese circumstances, while the assumptions on which they were basedwould remain false, the fears aroused by the Letter of Intent might become only too real.6.     Nor does the menace of this rate of increase lie only in whatpeople will think of it.    It lies also in what it means in terms of resources.    To make devaluation work we need to shift resources ofabout  900 million.    (This is higher than earlier estimates which included no figure for increased investment.    I think this should be atleast  100 million.     The remainder is made up of  500 million for improvement in the balance of payments - which is the absolute minimum -and  300 million for deteriorating terms of trade. )    This means that nearly all the extra resources we can hope to produce in 1968 will be needed for one of these three purposes.     The Economic Advisers1current estimate is that these will also apply in very large part to 1969.Any increase in personal consumption for next year, and any substantial increase for 1969, given the present public ejxp^expenditure^rogramme, istherefore ruled out.7.     For many the position would be worse than this.    Improvingstandards are inevitable for those who will be brought back into employ -ment or who are now somewhat underemployed but will in future workmore overtime.     The Government is also committed to protect the most vulnerable sections of the community.    For the majority at present infull-time employment the prospect might therefore be one of slightlyfalling living standards for up to 2 years to come,     I doubt if this ispolitically tenable.8.     We must therefore in my view took at the main areas of public expenditure without being bound by past rigidities and commitments.Unless we do this neither the economy nor the Government will recover.This fresh look should apply equally to defence and civil spending.     Wecould not hope to secure approval for a package which regarded present defence assumptions and commitments as inviolable.    Equally therecan be no question of defence carrying the whole burden.9.      In both fields, however, we shall need to go fcr savings whichare clearly identifiable and not merely parings down (which will not carry conviction) within the framework of existing policies.    Here again the needs of confidence are buttressed by those of the resources situation.Whatever we do we will still be left with a formidable increase in expenditure for 1968-69.     This can in my view only be containable if wehave already announced changes which will mean bigger savings in the succeeding years.    And such savings as we make for 1968-69 must not,from the resources point of view, involve pushing expenditure back intothe subsequent year.    On the contrary we shall need more and not lesselbow-room in that year, for 1969-70 is bound to be a year with considerable pressures for a reasonable increase in personal consumption.-2-
10,     There would clearly be disadvantages in trying to rushdecisions before Christmas.    I hope the reserves position can be held for them to be made in early January.    But I thought it wrong to allow the Cabinet to disperse without these basic considerations before it.r,, h. J.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.13th December, 1967-3-
