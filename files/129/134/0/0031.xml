HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67) 202 COPY NO.22nd December, 1967CABINETTHE APPROACH TO europe note by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister and in accordance withhis summing up of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 20th December(CC(67) 73rd Conclusions, Minute 3) I circulate the attached   study of the consequences of our exclusion from the European economic community (e.c.) for our future economic, military and otherpolicies.    This study was, of course, prepared before the outcome ofthe meeting of the e.c. Council of Ministers on 18th-l9th december was known(Signed) BURKE trend cabinet Office, S. W. 1.22nd December, 1967
CONSEQUENCES OF UNITED KINGDOM EXCLUSION FllOk Trig EECThe Cabinet, at their meeting on 30th November (c(67)69th Conclusion,Item4),requested a study by officials of -&quot;The consequences of our exclusion from the Community for our future economic, military and other policies, on the lines suggested bythe Secretary of State for Defence and elaborated in discussion.This study should cover inter alia agricultural policies; defence,including NATO, FEU, and the offset arrangements for the british army of the Rhine, as well as defence procurement; the UnitedKingdom relations with EFTA and EFTA relations with e.c..&quot;2.     This paper proceeds on the assumption that the conclusion reached by the e.c. on our application, whenever it comes and whatever form it takes, will mean in effect that we shall be unable to join the Communityfor,  say, as long as President de Gaulle is in office.    On this assumptionwe examine, as requested, whether we can develop alternative economic andpolitical relationships; whether we might still find it advantageous to pursue &quot;European&quot; policies or whether, if we felt free to disregard thepossibility of shaping some of our policies with an eye to their eventualassimilation to those of the e.c., we might obtain advantages which wehave so far had to forego.   The paper is, thus, concerned with the policies open to us in face of exclusion from the Community and not withthe tactics we might then follow.3.   The basic choice for the United Kingdom will still remain whether toabandon our European policy or to reaffirm our intention to join theCommunity as and when circumstances permit it.   It must be recognised here that a reaffirmation now of our European policy would only mean arestraint on the scope for changing existing policies insofar as viablealternative policies actually exist.   We therefore examine first thevariants of the basic choice before us -(i)   we could seek some alternative grouping to e.c., i,eP we couldattempt to build an Atlantic Free Trade Area (AFTA) or seekcloser Commonwealth association or a permanent and strengthenedEFTA;we could continue as we are, preserving as far as possible our existing trade relationships with the Commonwealth and EFTA,while:(a)   reaffirming our intention to seek membership of EECas soon as this was possible;or(b) taking the position that we intended to leave open for future decision whether or not we would apply for entry to e.c. when this was possible.1-
In the following paragraphs we examine alternative (i) under the heads ofAFTA, the Commonwealth and a permanent strengthened EFTA;    and havingconcluded that none of these courses is likely to prove feasible we go onin the remainder of the paper to consider the possibilities underalternative (ii).Atlantic Free Trade areas.     The possibility of an AFTA (which as a working hypothesis v/as assumed to consist of the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, norway and Sweden, Australia, New Zealand and the Republic of Ireland) was studiedat length earlier this year.     The study was circulated to the Cabinetlast April as C(67) 52.     The conclusion was that in the then existingcircumstances AFTA v/as not a negotiable option.     Subsequent events haveif anything strengthened the validity of that conclusion.     The lack ofinterest of the United States Administration in such arrangements willhave been confirmed by the successful conclusion of the Kennedy Round andthe agreement in principle reached at Rio on a special drawing rightsscheme, though the present state of the gold and foreign exchange marketsmakes prediction of United States attitudes in the longer term hazardous.For the present we conclude from the increase in pressures from protectionistlobbies in the United States, from the continuing interest of the UnitedStates Administration in our joining the Community rather than in looking to America, and from the fact that the United States Administration are unlikely to embark upon such a major political and economic realignment inthe 1968 Election year, that an AFTA is no more a negotiable option now than it was six months&apos; ago.     This conclusion is not invalidated by privatestudies of the economic implications of an AFTA undertaken in recent months,for example by Maxwell Stamp Associates on behalf of the Atlantic TradeStudy, sirce they did not deal at all with the question of whether an AFTAwould be negotiable.Extension of Commonwealth trading linBis5.     As the study prepared for the Cabinet in April 1 967 pointed out(paragraphs 39-A0 of the report attached to C(67) 52), consideration hasbeen given from time to time to seeking ways in which intra-commonwealth trade might be expanded to the advantage of the United Kingdom, but on thewhole the results have not been promising.     Trade with all commonwealth countries currently accounts for about 30 per cent of our exports and itis clearly in the United Kingdom interest to maintain a favourable positionin these markets for as long as possible.     Nevertheless, the United Kingdomposition has been steadily eroded and this process is likely to continue.The conclusion in April was that it might be possible to negotiate freshbenefits for some United Kingdom exports in some commonwealth  /ealth markets if-2-SECPLET
Ministers were prepared, to make fundamental changes in their Commonwealthpolicy, such as imposing mfn rates of duty on some Commonwealth imports andoffering to renegotiate preferences0     On recent experience, however, thereis no reason to expect that most other Commonwealth countries would hewilling to increase preferences or to enter into closer trading arrangements with the United Kingdom:   Canada and Australia, who are the most importantUnited Kingdom markets in the Commonwealth, have &quot;been seeking marketselsewhere and bargaining away the preferences which they give to thiscountry, since they appear to regard the potentialities of expanding marketselsewhere as more important to them than maintaining a preferential positionin the United Kingdom,6.     &quot;Je see no reason to dissent from the oonolusions reached last April,While devaluation should enable British firms to increase their sales in commonwealth markets as in other markets, it will have no effect on thepossibility of negotiating increased preferential arrangements within theCommonwealth.     Whatever we may say and do, Commonwealth countries,especially Canada, Australia and New Zealand, will expect that if a favourable opportunity arises in the future for United Kingdom entry into the e.c. weshall take it,     Furthermore, any possibilities there may be for closertrading links with Commonwealth countries would depend on our willingness to pay the price and accept the consequences involved in importing greaterquantities of Commonwealth agricultural produce.A more permanent role for EFTA?7.    &apos;7e have also considered the possibility of creating a more permanentrole for EFTA,     One of the stated objectives of the Stockholm Conventionestablishing EFTA was the achievement of wider European Union and any proposals to make EFTA a semi-permanent body would be unwelcome to a numberof other members (notably those who are anxious to join the e.c. with us)and would therefore be likely to have a disruptive effect within theAssociation:    and, as in the case of the Commonwealth, the other membersof EFTA will continue to believe, whatever we may say, that we shall makea fresh bid to join the e.c. (and leave EFTA members then to make what arrangements they may) as soon as the opportunity presents itself.     Andfrom our own point of view, even if EFTA could be built up as a eeoi-permanent organisation, it would not be a satisfactory alternative to EECmembership.     EFTA is not large enough;   it does not provide the industrial resources needed to match the other major world economic groupings;   nor would it meet our political requirements as part of a United Europe.-3-SEClRET
8.     Nevertheless, if we wanted to build up the solidity and cohesion of efta, it would be for consideration whether we could take on initiative in such sectors as agriculture, tariff harmonisation and economic union:but we are satisfied that, while it my be necessary to discuss thesematters from time to time, for the reasons given below it would neither benecessary nor desirable to lake any action.     Indeed, proposals of thiskind made by us at this time would not lead to any general consensus withinEFTA and could well prove disruptive.     Proposals for the geographicalextension of EFTA might prove rather less controversial, but as shown below the prospects for making any real progress are very slim.(i)   Agriculture.     We might try to give EFTA greater agriculturalcontent, for example by co-ordinating internal agriculturalpolicies or promoting a greater degree of free trade inagriculture by removing existing duties and other barriers.Such policies are unlikely to b e generally acceptable to theother EFTA countries since they would entail sharp falls ofagricultural income in those EFTA countries which have theleast advanced agricultural industries but the largestproportion of the population in agriculture.     Nor would they be welcome to us:   we have already given EFTA agriculturalexports extensive access to our markets (90 per cent of Danishagricultural exports already enjoy free entry) and further concessions could only be at the expense of our own agricultureand of Commonwealth and other overseas suppliers.(ii)   Harmonisation of tariffs.     A common external tariff for EFTAwould seem likely to lead to a closer relationship between themembers.     But the low-duty EFTA countries like Switzerlandand the Scandinavians, whose economies are narrowly based andtherefore rely on imports for a wide range of manufactures,would not want to raise their tariffs on these goods j   and theless developed members like Portugal and Austria would ingeneral be reluctant to lower theirs*     There would also Thevery serious objections from the point of view of the UnitedKingdom;   we should presumably have to abandon commonwealth preference, and, as a relatively high-duty country within 1FTA,under the rules of the GATT have to reduce our tariffs on importsfrom our main industrial competitors.     While   such extensivechanges in our tariff structure can be justified as part of thecomplete orientation required in going into the e.c., theadditional trade we might secure from a strengthened EFTA (in 1966,United Kingdom gross national product accounted for 57 per cent of the gross national product of the whole of EFTA) would notbe worth the disruption to Commonwealth and other trade,-4-
(iii)   Eqonomio Union.     More intensive work on the removal of non-tariff barriers or the a cceptanoo of fresh obligations leadingin the direction of economic union might possibly produce someadvantages for our export trade.     But the existing provisionsof the Stockholm Convention on non-tariff barriers have alreadycaused us considerable trouble - for example over the exportrebate and currently over the aluminium smelter project.Moves towards economic union with EFTA would further restrictour freedom to pursue flexible economic policies - and inter-ventionist policies - without a worthwhile return incompensation.     Economic union within a small economic groupingof the size of EFTA of which only one or two members apart fromthe United Kingdom have a highly developed industrial economy would in any case be of much less value to us - for example, in developing advanced technology - than eoonomic union with a market of the size and resources of the enlarged e.c..(iv)   C^eo^aplai^al^extension of EFTA.     We have again considered whether EFTA might be extended to include such other countries as Iceland, Yugoslavia, Israel and Spain.     But the latter twohave shown no interest in EFTAj   Iceland is a tiny market whichwould pose awkward problems on fish;   and Yugoslavia which hasrecently liberalised its economic policies to some extent andis in many ways an attractive   market for British goods, could still have serious difficulty in adapting hor commercialpractices, with thoir strong element of central control,, tomake them consistent with EFTA membership09.     There remains the possibility that a formal trade association betweenEFTA and the e.c. might be developed.    While this trade seems likely to expand in any case - although less quickly than it would if there were asingle European market - the prospects for creating new institutionallinks between the two (&quot;bridge-building&quot;) do not seem any more promisingor likely to succeed than they were in 1964-65.     There is every reason tobelieve that any suggestion that the e.c. as a single unit might join EFTA.would be as unfavourably received to-day as it has been in the past,.bothby the French and the convinced &quot;Europeans&quot;,,     We would not, however,rule out the possibility of working out free trade arrangements betweenEFTA and the e.c. for particular sectors of trade, possibly using the precedent of the United States/Canadian arrangement for free trade inmotor cars and motor car parts.,&apos;
FUTURE UNITED IQ1\TGD0M POLICY10.   The conclusion we draw is the same as that drawn from the previousexamination of alternatives in April (C(67) 52), namely that there isno new trade &quot;bloc or grouping which we could hope to establish in the foreseeable future as an alternative to joining the e.c..   In the longer term therefore we can see no alternative to seeking membership of theCommunity as soon as the opportunity presents itself.   We still need toform part of the enlarged Community in relation to our political objectives in a united Europe;   in relation to EFTA which might notcohere indefinitely in the face of the counter attractions of the Communityfor Austria and possibly Denmark; and in relation to our industrial and commercial needs for a wider domestic market, if British industry is toplay a full part in the future development of the advanced technological(and growth) industries; and as an insurance against the development ofmore illiberal polird.es among our main trading partners.   In relation toour defence and overseas policies, membership of an enlarged community would be helpful both because it would give us greater long-term economic strength and because the emphasis for these policies is increasingly onour European role.   Annex A is a fuller note on defence and overseas policyin relation to Europe.11,   In the light of these conclusions about longer term policy we nowexamine the consequences for us of continuing with our present arrangements - economic, political and military - for a number of years;and to consider whether in the face of exclusion from the e.c. we shouldreaffirm now our intention of joining as soon as we can, or whether weshould say that we will decide about that in the light of the circumstances and of our interests when the opportunity for membership becomes open.12,   The significance of continuing our present trading arrangements, whichwe then described as &quot;abstention&quot;, was also examined in April.   Theconclusion then was that in the short to medium term the United kingdom should be able in such circumstances to prosper and enjoy a satisfactoryrate of economic growth provided that world trading and monetaryconditions remained liberal and we pursued internal policies to makeindustry competitive in international markets.   In the longer term, however,we should suffer increasing disadvantages from the lack of the largedomestic market which will become increasingly necessary for the developmentof competitive advanced technology industries, and also from the risk thatthe existing major powers and trading blocs might over the years become less liberal.
13.   The prospects for the United Kingdom of continuing as at presenthave, however, been substantially improved since the April survey was made.   The Kennedy Round hag been successfully concluded.   So faras the e.c. is concerned the Commission have calculated that the mediancommon external tariff for industrial goods will be reduced from12 to 8 per cent and two-fifths of this reduction is due on 1st July I968.British industry has thus been presented with significant newepportunities worldwide and, in particular, with some part of theopportunity which it was expecting from United Kingdom membership of the eec;   in addition its competitive position has been strengthened meanwhileby devaluation.   Our purpose must be to do all in our power to promoteBritish exports in EFTA, in the Commonwealth, in the e.c., indeedworldwide.lZf.   External economic policy should for the next few years be concentratedwholly on the overriding economic priority - the improvement of the structure of the British economy and of the balance of payments.   in seeking to do this we should favourably consider any arrangements -whether in relation to the e.c., the Commonwealth or EFTA - which furtheredthis end; and reject those which hindered it.   If we were confronted witha veto, with no compensating offers of real and advantageous co-operation from the Five, we could do this wholly untrammelled by considerationsarising either from membership of, or candidacy for, the Community.   Anote on United Kingdom economic policy after a veto, prepared by a group of Economic Advisers under the chairmanship of Sir Alec Cairncross, isat Annex B.15.   Concentration now on the policies needed to put the economy right willnot reduce our future prospects of joining the Community.     On the contraryeach of the Six has shown in various degrees concern about the effect onthe future prosperity of the Community of the entry of the United kingdom in its present weakened state.   The present objections on the part ofFrance to our obtaining membership - or whatever other relation we judge in the future to be most appropriate - will be greatly reduced if we arethen economically strong.   This means making full use of the opportunitiespresented by devaluation to improve our balance of payments and reserveposition and to strengthen the efficiency and stability of the economy generally.-7-
16.   There can be no doubt that the achievement of these objectives is both a prime national interest for us and one in which we should have thefullest support of the Six: continued instability on our part is bound to affect them adversely.   The question may arise in some cases whether themethods which we use to achieve these objectives v/ill be such as tonarrow or widen the gap that separates our arrangements from those ofthe Community,   Clearly we must choose those methods best calculated to promote our recovery, and only where there is no significantdifference of advantage in terms of economic recovery can we consider,as a further factor, how far one method or the other would fit withthose used by the Six,   As it happens, their progress in harmonisationof economic measures has not yet gone far save in the agricultural sector.We shall in any event have to face the views of the Six on our post-devaluation policies and measures in the discussions of our economic progress in the IMF and OECD.17.   If, whilst our economic recovery was proceeding and whilst we were still excluded from the Community, we were able to influence the community and prevent it from developing in directions which made fair future entrymore difficult or more costly for us this v/ould obviously be advantageous;but we must recognise that we are unlikely in practice to have moresuccess in this direction than will result from the&apos;1 ever-present internalconflicts within the Community, which will be sharply exacerbated by a french veto on the opening of negotiations, coming as it will on top ofthe long record of French chauvinism in the Community,18.   We should therefore, after a veto, seek as close consultation withthe Five as they will allow; how far they will go may well depend onthe circumstances in which a veto is imposed.   We have concluded(paragraph 10) that in the long-term there is no satisfactory alternative to United Kingdom membership of the e.c..   Nevertheless, at this stage itwould be premature to decide as soon as it became clear that we had no prospect of immediate entry, whether we should reaffirm immediately andunconditionally our intention of joining as soon as we could and offerour readiness to press on meanwhile with collaboration in technologicaland other fields:    or whether to adopt a less precise and more cautiousposition.   The manner in which we were excluded and the strength orweakness of support for us among the Five up to and at the stage of decision would be important and possibly decisive factors in determining-how we should react.-8-
.   ANNEX a defence AND OVERSEA   POLICY IN RELATION TO EUROPEConsiderations of oversea and defence policy do not run counter tothe conclusions reached in the economic field.    We have made it clear thatour security depends primarily on preventing war in Europe, and that we regard the continuation of a politically cohesive and militarily effectiveNorth Atlantic Alliance as vital to this purpose.     Outside Europe we are engaged essentially in a policy of withdrawal and disengagement from ourremaining obligations on a basis agreed with our Allies.     The studiesundertaken earlier this year showed that if we are to be able to oompeteeoononioally with our main competitors, then our defence expenditure must bereduced to a level which is in keeping with our resources;   we accordingly decided on both political and economic grounds to plan on the basis of withdrawl from our main bases in the Middle and Par East by the mid-1970s.The ciroumstances we are now considering are a powerful argument for pressingahead as quickly as feasible on the course we have already set outselvesso as to ensure the early restoration of our economic strength.2.     Our defence links in Europe go much wider than the e.c. countries andour relationship with Prance and in our future policy towards Europe weshall still wish to carry the Five with us in our defence objectives inEurope.     NATO itself includes all members of the e.c. (though France Isnot now a fully participating member), some of our EFTA partners, the UnitedStates and Canada.     In NATO, while we should still do nothing to pushFrance further out of the Alliance, we need have less hesitation in pressing the line that France cannot be allowed to stop the rest of the Allies doing what they want to do and, in particular, we can continue to encourageinitiatives such as those which led to the present revision of NATO strategy,The United States have said, in the context of the possibility of ourexclusion from the e.c., that they would have no objection to a European&quot;caucus&quot; within NATO and we should encourage this.     While progress is boundto be slow, this field is one where a United Kingdom initiative at an appropriate time might prove useful.    We are also members, along with the eec countries, of Western European Union but most of its defence responsi-&quot;b Hit lea and interests have passed to NATO.3.     So far as the deployment of our forces on tho Continent of europe is concerned, all the necessary action is in hand to ensure the redeploymentto the United Kingdom of one brigade and one helicopter squadron, startingduring the current financial year, in accordance with the decision of-9-SECiRET
Ministers in March.    A preliminary report is being submitted, initiallyto tho Ministers concerned individually, on the question of offsetarrangements.     This will show that, so far as we can see, there is no real prospect of covering the foreign exchange costs of our forcesremaining in Germany next year to anything like the same extent as theyhave been covered hitherto.      The possibility of securing our Allies4agreement to further withdrawals of troops in the near future is remote.A.     In the context of longer-term arrangements for covering our foreign exchange costs, and in accordance with our general policy includingtechnological co-operation with Europe, the most promising field is that of equipment projects.     The present programme of bilateral co-operation(.Taguar, Martel and helicopters) with France is based on self-interest.There is alreadyapolioy ruling not to enter into any new bilateral projectswith France;   this derives from the fact that our main co-operativeprojects are all with France and it was for this reason considered unwise to commit ourselves to any further projects with France alone.    As regardsthe rest of the e.c. and other Western European countries, we should do our best not only to persuade them to buy our equipment but also seek, despite the considerable difficulties, to find areas of co-operation where it is inour interests to do so.     The aviation field, where all European countries are feeling the pressure of United States technology and a number of them,excluding France, are facing major decisions about their re-equipment programme, presents the most obvious opportunities.     There is a possiblecoincidence of interests in this field, but it is not going to be easy tofind common ground unless the United States can be persuaded to givebenevolent co-operation rather than competition and unless the european countries concerned are prepared to show the determination, including a willingness to,override national pressure groups, that would be necessary.-10-
ANNEX BUNITED KINGDOM ECONOMIC POLICY AFTER A VETO(Note by the Economic Advisers)Our primary purpose over the next few years should be to get the economy on a sound footing, with an adequate surplus in the balance ofpayments as a firm foundation for continuing expansion.2.     Even before devaluation there were major structural adjustments to be accomplished.     Devaluation enlarges the scale of the adjustments necessaryalthough it also makes some of them easier.     Serious additional burdens, as has been publicly stated, would be involved in an early entry into theCommunity.3.     A veto on our membership of the Community would not fundamentally alterthis picture.     It would mean that we were free to give absolute priority togetting the economy straight without the additional burdens involved Inentry.4.    We can see no fresh initiative in commercial policy that would belikely to be helpful to our recovery in the near future.     Because of devaluation we now have sufficient competitive strength to bring about thenecessary changes in our balance of payments provided we are willing to make all the necessary adjustments in domestic policy.     While there is no reason why we should throw away the advantages we derive in our trading relation-ships with other Commonwealth and EFTA countries, we should regard any economic advantages that might conceivably be obtained by strengtheningthese relationships as entirely subsidiary to the opportunities which areopened up by the depreciation of the pound.5.    V/whatever posture we adopt in relation to future membership of the e.c.,we ought not to embark on changes in domestic policy designed to align these policies more closely with those of the Community unless this would be inour own immediate economic interest.     We have ahead of us such painful and difficult adjustments that it would be foolish to aggravate them byanticipating obligations which we may one day have to fulfil as members ofthe Community but which we need be in no hurry to take upon ourselves.     Wehave in mind obligations in relation to agricultural policy (which would raisethe cost of living);   in relation to taxation (which would have a stronglyregressive effect);   or in relation to overseas investment (involvingpremature relaxations in exchange control).-11-secret
6.     It would both strengthen foreign confidence in the way in which weare managing our affairs and at the same time in no way diminish oureventual chances of joining the Community if we made it clear that in thenext few years our primary purpose would be the strengthening of theBritish economy and that this would override other international objectives.7. Once this has been accomplished we will be in a stronger position to seek admission to the Community and to face the consequent adjustments.-12-
