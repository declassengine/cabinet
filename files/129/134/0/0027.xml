DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYTS GOVERNMENT)C(67) 198 COPY NO. 6 519th December, 1967CABINETOIL PR.ICES:  DEVALUATION AND SURCHARGEMemorandum by the Minister of PowerImmediately after devluation the oil companies informed myDepartment that their costs and the price of oil products would beaffected.    I requested them to make no changes until the effects of devaluation had been examined and a further review of the temporaryMiddle East surcharge had been undertaken.    The companies expecta decision by 22nd December, i. e. within the month provided for inthe early warning procedures.2,       Devaluation and the surcharge are quite distinct.     The formerwill have a continuing effect on oil prices because of the large foreign exchange content in the cost cf supplying oil; the latter is a short-termaddition to oil prices to meet the additional costs arising fromdisruption of the normal pattern of supplies as a result of theArab/Israel war and, in particular, from the closure of the suez canal.    Plov/ever, they need to be considered together in determining whether changes should be made in the current maximum prices of oilproducts.Devaluation3e       In examining the effect of devaluation of oil prices I have taken a normal pre-crisis pattern of supplies, and have assumed pre-crisisfreight rates.     The United Kingdom market is supplied to the extent of55 per cent by foreign companies, of whom Esso has far and away thelargest market share (25 per cent of the total);  and as to 45 per cent by Shell Mex-BP, of which Shell is 40 percent British owned and BPwholly British owned.    Devaluation affects companies differentlyaccording to the foreign exchange content of their costs.    BP requiresan increase of 0. 6dD a gallon to offset devaluation, Shell 09 8d., Esso00 9d. and the suppliers of the remaining 30 per cent of the marketupwards of 1. Od,    The average comes out at 0. 9d, a gallon or about la ton.4,       This average is the amount by which I consider that we should allow pre-crisis oil prices to rise to offset the effects of devaluation.It is not possible to set different prices for different companies and itwould be dangerous to pitch the price increase well below what theforeign companies need to meet their overseas payments commitmentswhen we depend to the extent of 55 per cent on wholly foreign-ownedsuppliers.    Even with an increase of 0. 9d, per gallon, many foreigncompanies will suffer by devaluation; by contrast BP (when supplies
return to normal) and to a lesser extent Shell, will gain by it and have their competitive position strengthened.    But taking the United kingdom market as a whole, an increase of 0a 9d. would fairly reflect the effects of devaluation and would, I believe, be regarded as reasonable by thecompanies.    It would also be in line with the prices at which Esso,Shell and BP, our principal suppliers, supply crude oil to their affiliatesin Europe, an important consideration in dealing with the domestic priceof an international commodity such as oil.Surcharge5.       The surcharge stands at about  2 a ton.    It was introducedspecifically to meet the additional costs of maintaining oil supplies to this country during the period of disruption caused by the Arab/Israelwar.    Except in the case of Esso, the surcharge has not so far fullyrecovered the extra costs incurred by the companies and BP has been particularly badly hit.    Nevertheless, with the reopening of shorf-haulMediterranean sources of supply, costs are falling despite the continuedclosure of the Suez Canal and there is scope for reducing the surcharge.6.       My Department has examined with the companies the effects ofthe crisis on their costc up to 31st December, 1967, and their forecastsup to 31st March, 1968.    The circumstances of the companies differwidely and to meet their additional crisis costs up to 31st March Ssscwould need about 20s. Od. ;  Shell a little less;   BP about 45s. Od. ;  Mobiland the other suppliers of the remaining 30 per cent of our requirementsupwards of 32s. 6d,    These figures take account of recoveries to date,,These estimates would in my opinion justify a surcharge of about27s. 6da a ton, a decrease of 16s, Od, from the present level.    Thisshould adequately cover the additional costs of Shell&apos;s and Esso&apos;s suppliesthough not of the remaining 50 per cents,7,       However, if v/e allow a surcharge of 27s, 6dc in addition to  1 aton for devaluation, some increase in oil prices will be necessary.    Ihave therefore considered whether the surcharge could be reducedfurther to  1 a ton without undue risk to supplies.    This is, of course,entirely a matter of judgment;  with the surcharge at  1, many suppliersv/ould undoubtedly suffer by comparison with their pre-crisis position andmight compare their treatment and opportunities unfavourably with their experience in Northern Europe where in general they are still recovering 2 a ton more than pre-crisis.    Moreover, the companies plan to rundown their stocks this winter more quickly than normally so as to getchartering costs down, a move that will also benefit our balance ofpayments although at some risk to our supplies.    Nevertheless, itseems to me that this is a calculated risk which we should take soas to avoid any increase in oil prices over their present levels.    Indue course, prices should, of course, come down further when the surchange is again reduced and finally eliminated,8.       There remains the question of product prices.    My preferencewould be to leave them unchanged, particularly as the scope for variationis limited.    But if my colleagues attach exceptional importance to evena small decrease in fuel oil price it would be possible to balance adecrease of 0, 25d, per gallon on fuel oil by an increase of 1. Od. per gallon on motor spirit.
90       I invite the Cabinet:-(i)   To agree that maximum oil prices should remain unchangeda reduction of the surcharge to  1 a ton balanced by an increase of account of devaluation.(ii) To note that I shall be announcing this decision on or before22nd December.R.
