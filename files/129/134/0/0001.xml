I RESTRICTED      . *-;S;DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)1 C(67) 171 COPY NO. ^ &apos;J30th October, 1967CABINETBROADCASTING OF PARLIAMENTARY BUSINESS:EXPERIMENT IN CLOSED CIRCUIT RADIOMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilSince the House rejected by a single vote the proposal for a combined experiment in radio and television coverage of House ofCommons debates which had been recommended by the Select Committee,I have been waiting for an opportunity to reopen the issue in a way likelyto remove some of the weakness of the previous plan and so to improve the chances of success.    I believe a suitable opportunity has now arrived.2.      During the Recess we have found it necessary to adapt the wiringsystem of the Chamber for radio so that Hansard can cover morningsessions when required by means, not of verbatim reporting, but of taperecording, which is then translated by a team of girls.    Subject to a test by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) of the microphoneinstallations in the House it should thus be technically possible to carry through the experiment in closed-circuit &quot;piped radio&quot; which the BBC,in its memorandum to the Select Committee, strongly urged shouldprecede any experiment in live television coverage of debates.    the experiment would take the form of piping the live radio broadcast to anumber of points where it could be listened to.    Simultaneously the bbc would supply a small staff which would prepare experimentalprogrammes of a national and regional character including a &quot;Today in westminster&quot; with live extracts from speeches.    These experimentalprogrammes would be played back each night in rooms where members could listen to them.    They would not be available to the general public.After the experiment had run for a sufficient time - perhaps a fortnightor three weeks - I should suggest that the House should be asked to cometo a decision on whether the service should be made permanent and available to the public.3.       The Cabinet will recall that the House of Lords decided that itsexperiment in television coverage should go on despite the House ofCommons1 decision.    Preparations are being made for a few dayscoverage in February, 1968.    I am sure that this will be of very great value in enabling the Cabinet, as well as the House of Commons to cometo a decision in due course on television.    But after consultation throughthe usual channels with the Liberal and Conservative Oppositions I am notrecommending that any further steps with regard to television should be-1-RESTRICTED
4 n   - t-taken in the forthcoming Session.    My proposal, which has the strong support of both Opposition parties, is for an experiment in live radiobroadcasts only, and after that experiment a decision, if possible, toput regular broadcasts on the air during this Sess ion.    Then we can make up our minds at leisure whether action should be taken abouttelevision in the next Session.4.       I accordingly seek authority to move an appropriate resolution in the course of the forthcoming debate on procedure, and subject to theagreement of the House thereto, to make arrangements for(i) an experiment during this Session in &quot;piped radio&quot; to selectedpoints in the House; and(ii)  the BBC, at the same time, to be enabled to broadcast on&quot;piped&quot; radio to Members an experimental series of editedextracts.R. H. S, C.Privy Council Office, S.W.1,30th October, 1967-2-RES7RICTED
