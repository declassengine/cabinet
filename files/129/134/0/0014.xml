OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C(67) 18422nd November, 1967CABINETDEVALUATION:  SOCIAL SECURITY CONSEQUENCESMemorandum by the First Secretary of state the Chancellorrs statement last weekend said:&quot;It is the Government^ firm intention to take, at the righttime, the steps which will be needed in order to protect the most vulnerable sections of the community fromhardship resulting from the change in the exchange rate. 112.      The Cabinet had previously asked me to discuss with theMinister of Social Security and with the Treasury the protection ofthose members of the community who would be most adversely affectedby devaluation P    These include old people, poor families and others who are eligible for supplementary benefits.3.      In relation to old people, it was concluded that for economic reasons it would be necessary to resist the pressure which must beexpected from pensioners generally.    We do not need to decide noweither the amount or timing of increases in supplementary benefits, asit seems unlikely that pressure from price rises will build upimmediately.    But my colleagues should, know that on the assumptionthat the cost of living is likely to increase during the next year by5 to 6 per cent, of which some half would be due to devaluation,increases in the supplementary benefit scales of the order of 4s. a weekmight be needed by the end of 1968 at a cost of some  35 million netin a full year.4.      But supplementary benefits do not help the families of the lowestwage earners in full time employment.    To help them some increasein family allowances would need to be considered.    In terms of bothprices and the need to resist the pressure of wage demands,flexibility of timing in any increase would be important.    The cost ofan increase in family allowances v/ould depend more on what amount would be politically presentable than on the amount which would be strictlyproportionate to a rise in prices for those children in respect of whomfamily allowances are payable.    The latter could be assumed to justifyUP to Is. a week for those children.    A presentable amount, say 3s.across the board, would cost  35 million net of tax at existing rates.There are, of course, many permutations of ways of providing anincrease according to size of family and to the total amount ofexpenditure.    This net extra cost would have to be met out of taxation.COPY NO.
5,      An increase in supplementary benefit scales could be made by regulations requiring an affirmative resolution, and at least threemonths would be needed after the decision to put new scales intopayment.    Action effective sometime between June and Octobex&quot; nextyear would therefore require a decision on amount and timing by April.6.      An increase in family allowances, however, requires legislation.There are two possibilities.    A Bill for this purpose could be introduced at the appropriate time next year.    (I am advised that it would not be appropriate to include provision regarding family allowances in the nextFinance Bill).    But it would be possible to amend the present family allowances and National Insurance Bill, now about to enter the committee stage, to empower the Minister of Social Security to make a further increase in family allowances - by Order subject to affirmative resolution - at whatever proves to be the right time.    A further MoneyResolution would be needed which could be taken on the same day as theremaining stages of the Bill but preceding them.    To amend the Bill inthis way would provide an earnest of the Governments intention toprotect the poorer families and might help in resisting pressure of wage demands and would certainly provide flexibility.    On the otherhand there must be some risk that this would stimulate pressure, e.g.from pensioners, for a similar commitment to protect them against theeffects of devaluation.7.      An immediate decision is necessary about the present Bill.The Cabinet are therefore asked to consider whether this Bill shouldbe amended to px*provide the enabling power described in paragraph 6.M.S,70 Whitehall, S. w. 1.22nd November, 1967-2-
