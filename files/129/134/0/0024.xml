Kg DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(67) 195 COPY NO.15m December, 1967CABINET&apos;industrial EXPANSION BILL,: DRAFT WHITE paper memorandum by the Secretary of State for Economic affairs a meeting of Ministers under the Chairmanship of the first secretary of State considered, on 12th December, a draft of the white paper which had been revised to allow for the different outlook sincedevaluation.    I attach a revised text of the White Paper which takes account of points raised during the ministers discussions.    The textincludes no reference to Concorde, since it has not yet been decided whether this will be handled under the Bill.2,      I was invited by the Cabinet on 9th November(CC(67) 64th Conclusions, Minute 4) to consider further with theMinister of Technology and the Chief Secrecary, Treasury, the limit tobe incorporated in the Industrial Expansion Bill on expenditure otherthan Cunard, Concorde and the National Research development corporation.    There are foreseeable requirements which might leadus to commit up to  105 million by the end of 1968 in support of the airframe merger, the aluminium smelting project, the acquisition ofBeagle, and a merger in the computer industry.     Other schemes arenot yet firm.    We are agreed that it would be reasonable to provide inthe Bill for an initial limit of  100 million, with power to increase thisby Order to an amount not exceeding  150 million.3.       I recommend that we should make provisions on these lines inthe Bill.P.S.Department of Economic Affairs, S.W.T.15th December, 1967
gRAglL: jHI TK.....PAPERINDUSTRIAL EXPANSIONThe Queen&apos;s Speech announced the Governments intention tointroduce legislation! to extend their ability to assist financiallyin the modernisations and technological advance of industry and inthe expansion of its capacity.2,     During the subsequent debate the Government explained thatthese provisions would not be used to displace existing sources of finance available to companies from commercial sources or fromgeneral schemes of fiscal or other incentives.    They were needed to enable the Government to help projects which were in the national economic interest but which, because of a divergence betweennational and private costs and benefits, especially in the shortterm, could not be expected to go ahead solely on the basis offinance from existing sources.    This measure is needed to launchsuccessful projects in co-operation with, private industry,the legislation will not confer any compulsory powers.3.     Specific projects in the private sector have in fact receivedspecial support from successive Governments in the past.    It isgenerally recognised here and in other advanced industrial countries that cases of this kind will continue to arise,k.     Since November 18th, the Government have been reviewing theneed for additional measures in the light of the new situation created by devaluation.   Devaluation should encoureige investment in British industry and,  in particular, in those industrieswhose opportunities for increased exports and import savinghave been enhanced; although particular projects that might otherwise have needed the stimulus and assistance of theIndustrial Expansion Bill may, in these new circumstances, now proceed without Government help, the main reasons for the bill are unchanged by devaluation.1
The need for wider powers5.    First, there is the need for the more rapid application of advanced technology in industry.   The Ministry of Technology haswide powers to support research and technological developmentbut there is very little scope for supporting the exploitation of results.    If the Government are to play their full part in industrial expansion which technological development now makespossible,  they must be able to operate more directly and moreflexibly in support of production itself.6.     Second, there are currently a number of cases where government financial support for industry is contemplated and the approvalof Parliament will be required.    In the absence of new general legislation, separate Bills would be necessary for the acquisitionof the Beagle   Aircraft Company, for further finance for there organisation of shipbuilding, for authorising an additional loan for the completion of the Queen Elizabeth II, and to provide additional capital for the National Research Development Corporation./The Government are also considering proposals, for aluminiumsmelting which, under present arrangements, would require separate legislation to authorise financial participation,;/77.     Third, the Government is concerned not only with legislative authority for proposals which have already been worked out with industry or which are under negotiation but with the ability to respond promptly to further needs as they emerge.    Therehas been and is likely to continue to be a succession of casesrequiring Government help.    The timing of financial assistance will be of critical importance in some of these cases.8,     The fourth consideration follows from this fact.    It istime to establish a rigorous, independent and consistent systemof appraisal for these cases to ensure that Government help isProvided fairly and economically.    At the same time, provision
should &quot;be made for more effective and rapid Parliamentaryscrutiny of individual projects.An Industrial., Expansion bill.     In order to meet these needs, the Government propose tointroduce legislation to authorise the Minister of technology and other Ministers with responsibilities for industry to providedirect assistance to projects designed to promote efficiency; tosupport technological advance; or to create, expand or sustainproductive capacity.    For the Minister of Technology this wouldbe a widening of the scope of his powers under the Science and technology Act, .1965, for carrying on or supporting scientific research or the disseminatiom of the results of scientific research, and under the Civil Aviation Act, 19h9, to support the design,  development and production of civil aircraft.    The new legislation would enable the Minister to support the design,development and production of other products, in addition to civil aircraft.10.    The Minister concerned, with tho consent ,p  the Treasury,would he empowered to. give financial support to agreed industrial investment schemes which might, according to circumstances, takethe form of loans, grants, guarantees, the underwriting of lossesor the subscription of share capital.    It is proposed to include in the Bill a limit to the total of financial assistance whichmay he made available to industry under it.11.    The Bill will not confer any compulsory powers, either directly or indirectly.    For the Government to use compulsionwould clearly not accord with their purpose of launchingsuccessful projects in co-operation with private industry.   It   -follows that the Bill will not confer any powers to acquireshares in any industrial undertaking otherwise than by voluntary agreement.    The Government do not intend to acquire shares freelyon the market.    An object of a Government shareholding in certainprojects would be to provide for a return to the Exchequer if tho3.
profits justified it without imposing too great a &quot;burden offixed interest debt  at tho outset.    In some circumstances thisnight bo achieved by a preference shareholding; in others an investment in ordinary shares might be more suitable.12.   The powers under tho new legislation would be available tosupport eligible projects in any industry (including services)  inthe private sector.    The Government do not intend to use the new legislation where the same object could be achieved under existing provisions relating to the industry in question, for exampleagriculture (to the extent that existing legislation providesfor Government support).    Nor does the Government intend to take action under this Bill which would duplicate work already in theprovince of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation,    TheCorporation has authority under Section 2(l)(b) of its Act toassist the establishment or development of individual enterprises,but the scope for action here is limited by the need to concentrate on the priority task of promoting industrial reorganisation.13.   The powers under the new legislation will be used only forprojects which would not take place without Government support and where the Government judge it to be in the national interest togive that support.    It is not intended to use them as a generalsubstitute for investment grants in industries which do not qualifyunder the Industrial Development Act, 1966.    Projects to beconsidered for support will be carefully selected and the provisionof Government finance to them will be subject to no less stringentexamination than that applied to investment in the private sectoror in the nationalised inudstries.    In the ordinary course,  companies&quot;Will continue to rely on their own resources, augmented by generalschemes of fiscal and other incentives, or to secure support from commercial sources and existing financial institutions.   TheGovernment have no intention of displacing these Sources offinance.
1h.   The Government will submit these projects to a comprehensiveevaluation and an advisory committee will be set up, including members of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation and theNational Research Development Corporation and drawing on their staff, to which it will be the Government&apos;s general intention torefer individual projects for assessment and advice.     TheAdvisory Committee will also be asked to consider whether anyaspects of these projects involve unfair discrimination betweenfirms and what action might be appropriate to meet this.15.    Inquiries into the needs of particular industries - normallyby committee specially appointed by the Government but possiblycarried out by other bodies such as the Economic development committees - may lead on occasion to recommendations for generalschemes of support for the industry concerned, as distinct fromsupport for individual projects.     Where these recommendations are accepted,  the responsible Minister may wish to set up anindependent board to advise him on their detailed application and the Bill will enable this to be done.     If the suggestion for the establishment of an industry board does not stem from some form of independent inquiry it v/ill first be considered by theAdvisory Committee,16.    The arrangements for evaluation and advice will be reviewed in the light of experience.17.    In order to ensure that schemes put forward under the new legislation are subject to proper scrutiny by Parliament, theBill will provide that no Minister will be allowed to make useof the new powers granted under it without first having to define the scheme or specific proposal in an Order laid beforeParliament and obtaining the approval of the House of Commonsfor proceeding with it.18.    In exercising the powers under the new legislation, theGovernment will take full account of regional needs and pay due regard to international obligations.5.
Conclusion19.   The proposed measure is designed to deal with a number ofschemes which are already well advanced.      It is also required inorder to xorovide machinery for helping desirable future schemes which involve industrial expansion and the more rapid applicationof technology.6.
