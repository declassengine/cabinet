SPEECH BY THE PRIME minister the RT. HON.

France &quot;has&quot;always rejected any suggestion of Britain being&apos;&quot; ad with&apos; the Six in an industrial free trade area, understandably because of thendenoe of the French economy on her domestic agriculture.&quot;   After all they have about Britain^ cheap food and its implication for our wage levels, and there-our industrial competitiveness, it is inconceivable that negotiations forNation would not involve evpn more complex, indeed perhaps &quot;interminable&quot;!Mssiohs,    Because&quot;,&apos; unlike an application for full member-ship, where we are fully within the Treaty of Rome and the subsequent decisions taken underaaty, here we should, all of us&apos;,, bo entering into unoharted seas, and with3 to guide us. &apos; - &apos;^application is in.&quot;    It remains in.

Thereforeclebate continue, net only in Britain but throughout Europe.
9 q 0hi if was ray contribution to this debate today, I should like to take up some of thefoments made on Monday and put them in a truer perspective.   I will take themit order.It was said that it is contradictory to propose the opening v/ithout delay ofsatiations rath the Six while declaring our willingness to accept all the pro-Jisions and regulations governing the Community.   If we accept -ftiose clauses in    .Jounce, what, we were asked, is there to negotiate about?liligEiI quote the Treaty of Home.   Article 237 provides that &quot;Any European StateJay apply t0 become a member of the Community.   It shall address its applicationi the Council which; after obtaining the opinion of the Commission, shall give aliEUiiiious decision thereon.The conditions of admission and the adjustments to this Treaty necessitated bylit shall be the subject of an agreement between the Member States and theIjpplicant State&quot; *This speaks for itself, since any agreement has to be negotiated.I It was said that the Report of the Brussels Commission showed that the Commongirket was incompatible with the economy of Britain in a number of respects.te/er:Did the Commission recommend or did they not recommend that &quot;negotiations should be opened in the most appropriate form with the States which have applied for neinbership&quot;?&quot;), It was said, as proof of this incompatibility, that Britain&apos;s chronio balancesf payments deficit proved the permanent dis-equilibrium of her economy.Itaer;What was france s balance of payments dis-equilibrium in the two years aftersigning the Treaty of Rome? vfithout going into the unprofitable question of whatWbalance of payments would have been this year, but for the Middle East, haveFrench Government not seen that the international staffs of the I.I.I.F. and5.E.C.D.. strongly support the view that the decisions we have taken offer a firmRospect of transforming our balance of payments within 12 months?    -        . --&apos;1*  It was said that the British economy was incotapatiltolo because of-itsWoes of supply, credit practices and conditions of work&quot;.On sources-of supply and channels of trade we have stated that we accept tnefteaty of Rome.   And the present menbers of the Community,, acting under that Treaty,have themselves accepted the Yaounde Convention which ensures that developing countries&apos;with whom France - and others - had long-standing trading - indeedhitioal - connections, should be able to trade freely with tho Community.   Uelave mado it clear that we should expect to follow this precedent.Djis brings, me to5.  The reference5to our credit practices.   I am not oil per what the reference18 here.   But if the French President is referring to the working of the City oftadon and considers perhaps that our arrangements for finanoing industry on thetoe taarket of the City of London ore not in accordance with the doctrines offoe. Treaty of Rome, I feel it right to point out that it is the French creditAstern, not ours, which controls the allocation of specially favourable credit,^stry by industry, in accordance with the priorities laid down by theMssariat du Plan.,   In the-same sentence there was, as I have said, a reference to our- &quot;Editions du travail&quot;,fa &apos; 2.
2 Q if the French President was referring to recent strikes in Britain, let meI deplore these as profoundly as General de Gaulle deplores strikes, in his country.     But, t- put this into perspective, let ne also point out that in britain lost, through industrial disputes, for every 1OO0 persons employed,nan-days against 240 in Prance.     Figures to be published tomorrow show thatthe five years 1962-66, our figure was 230 against a French figure of 322 .both of us the figures are too high.     We must both do better.It was said that the Common Market is incompatible with the way in which we ourselves, with our agriculture &quot;subsidised to the hilt&quot;,bier:lot us show at least an elementary knowledge of the facts.     Both agricultures -jsend that of the Comunity -- are substantially supported and look for theirfjtra returns both tc the taxpayer and to the consumer:   but in the Community theHLort is nore from enhanced prices t&quot; the consumer than from the taxpayer.     InHjstatenent to the House on May 2, I made it clear, as I had done before, that weSjito rec&apos;gnise that the Community&apos;s agricultural policy was an integral part ofiConnunity and that we must come to terms with it.     And we recognised too thatrail involve far-reaching changes in the structure of British agriculture&apos;iepoints we had in mind to discuss with the Six were spelled out in the Foreigniaretary1 s statement to the V/estern European Union, Command Paper No,3345, offor great accuracy a copy was given to the French Government.It was said that vie could never really accept the &quot;crushing&quot; levies laidJ&apos;m under the Common Market&apos; s financial regulation for agriculture.Imp:Again I quote what I said in the House in announcing our application - and the^thought was repeated in Command Paper No,- 3345.     These financial arrangementstold, if applied to Britain as they now stand, invalve an inequitable sharing ofis financial cost and impose on our balance of payments an additional burden whichiishould net in fairness be asked to carry.&quot;     But the       . point that the automatictance cf a mathematical formula cf calculating contributions could involvel^itftWe burdens was strongly pressed by Germany in May 1966 and a solution wasIs the French Government really saying that no solution could be found forpain, particularly as Britain&apos;s succession would certainly load to an increasebPranoG1 s net income from the Fund?.&apos; It was said that the Common Market was incompatible with British restrictions* capital movements abroad as compared with the freedom cf such movements among&amp;5ix,FAgain we have made clear that we fully accept the obligations of Communitywship in this field, subject only to a transitional period during 7/hich weihy stages bring our policies into line with those of the Community.
l would add that freedom of direct capital movement within the enlargedsunity is essential to secure our aim of a European-wide industrial andugical base and to give reality to the concept for which we, and others,Impressing of the European Company.   If we are to build up, as we must, thetjistrial independence of Europe, the first call on the capital arising inJ^opg from the thrift of Europe&apos;s citizens must be for that purpose and for thaLj3 of the underdeveloped world and not to be diverted for gain to Manhattan, for purpose of fertilising American technological development at a time when wethat capital in Europe to close the gap.L  it was said that the Common   Market was incompatible with the state ofIdling, as devaluation has again demonstrated.awer:Did not France devalue?   And is it not a fact that Monsieur Couve degrille&apos;s carefully worded statement at Luxembourg earlier this month was widelyIstorpreted in Europe - and further afield - as a call for devaluation of the?Critical referenoe v/as also made to the international loans required byJiritain before- and concurrently with devaluation.International financial facilities were freely offered by the InternationalIScetftiy Community, including France, as a means of ensuring international stability!a financial and trading arrangements.   \/e have made clear that the facilitiesprided on and since November 18 are a means of seeing the devaluation operationtough with a minimum of disturbance to the world and ensuring that there issfficient backing while the effects of devaluation are working themselvesugh the economy.i  It was said that membership of the Common market was incompatible with thestate of sterling because of its character as an international currency and thesuubrance of the vast sterling balances.per;Is the General prepared to respond to the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s offer)discuss on a European basis all aspects of tho international position of sterlingjiBluding the possibility of a European currency?As to the &quot;encumbrance of the vast sterling balances&quot;, Britain had no sterlingpknoe problem before, the Par.   It was originally created during the vl&amp;r.   It waspt of the enduring cost which Britain incurred in the fight to make Europe  free,tws in fact part of the price we have had to pay for those historic days toxwbiohineral de Gaulle has frequently, and indeed movingly referred., - the days whenjfoe France and Britain fought together.We wero told that any attempt tc impose British entry would lead to the-reak-up of a community whose rules would not bear such a &quot;monumental exception&quot;*It is not Britain whose policy on such basic questions as foreign affairs,e and international monetary policy is the &quot;monumental exception   to the1 European c nsensus on these questions.   Nor is it Britain which is nowMeeting the article of the Treaty of Rome which provides that &quot;any European1&apos;toto may apply to become a Member of the Community&quot;.To start negotiations now for British entry, so it was said, &quot;would be for** Six to consent in advance to all the artifices, delays and make-believe whichtend to conceal the destruction of an edifice built with so much effort and^d such hopes&quot;.
^ lino,4 oust re^Oes of success will be imperilled unless we show an equal sense of urgency&quot;Wniaation about prices,,This is based on a static conception of Europe, when, unless all of usSSLe move quickly, we, as Europe, will fall behind.     It is a labouredf7of a European train slewed up by adding more coaches.     what it fails to-that a European train, for which Britain and other countries would provideiLfi motive force, could be much more powerful?   and would continue to move!the&apos; track which will leaS to  ur common objective of a united Europe.rbaVe tried to make clear to all our friends in Europe that those who rely ontatic concept in a rapidly moving w: rid are moving backwards.    We want toJuth. all those in Europe who are forward-looking, in a determined movefoil.Ipe were told that a negotiation with Britain would not be the way to ensureiSoropo was not &quot;dependent on a foreign economic monetary and political system&quot;;flat Europe should be a &quot;counterweight to the immense power of the United States&quot;., what matters here is nt words but action.     Such action as the creation of^Sropean technology for which I called in my Guildhall speech.     But whilejteinis prepared to take an initiative in this field in advance of negotiations,^initiative will become a reality in terms of European industrial independenceLif we in Europe are ready to. take all the steps necessar  to create a singleffiftan industrial market.BOur attention was drawn to the coincidence between the American deficit init balance of payments and the total of American investments in Western Europe:that France &quot;wishes this abuse to be ended&quot;.fc^  V/e are not going to solve our problems in Europe by attacks      one another1 sRace of payments, or on the balance of payments of the United States.     Beggar-my-Bijiour policies ore not the answer, and, if we were to embark on them we shouldHi that not all the cards are held on this side   f the Atlantic.ilkt we havo to do is to build up a vigorous and independent European industry,fiters - Britain has opted for independence.     Aero-ongines - Britain, togetheriiiour European partners, can load the field.     But only if those partners,H&amp;eukrly Prance, will take the same independent lino.     Atomic energy?     We inagain can load the world, but not if bur partners insist on tying themselvesso icon know-how which we in Europe, if we work together, can do without.:!;ar fuel?    Using the know-how of Britain as well as that of our Europeanliners could make Europe boH&apos;h competitive and independent. &apos;s .  .above all, we recognise that none of us can neat the threat to our indus-al independence unless we are prepared to work together within a single and widerinic Community, with a powerful technological base, the&apos;only foundation forptoaio and political independence, for a truly European voice in world affairs.Britain accepts the challenge - the European challenge.     But let everyone hereabroad recognise we have enormous reserves of economic strength and we intend to be% that strength to the full by our own efforts.Btfoat British industry must now show is a sense of urgency about the action thatRetaken to seize the opportunities, to take the decisions that the new situation&quot;ing devaluation affords us.wry industrialist must now force the pace with his export plans, his sales^overseas - and everyone who has the opportunity must now consider how they can^oo for the home market on a fully competitive basis goods for which until nowe depended on imports.ftis is the constructive approach that the nation now expects of Britain&apos;sBjty.    If anyone wants to indulge in criticism, let them reinforce their words&apos;\&amp;n&apos; ty firGt G&apos;&apos;in  out ^ getting their export orders and then by ensuringpeso export orders are going to be met - and on time.
