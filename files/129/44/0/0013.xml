Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1951SECRETCP. (Sly 1315 th January, 1951NATIONALISATION OF PUBLIC WATER SUPPLIES:   ENGLANDAND wales memorandum by the Minister of Health  .While I still feel that the proposals set out in my previous papers (CP. (50) 54and CP. (50) 145), which contemplated a nationalised public water serviceadministered as part of the Civil Service, would be likely to prove the most efficient,I appreciate the views of those of my colleagues who wish to avoid depriving localauthorities entirely of their interest in this service when nationalised, and I havebeen thinking over ways and means by which local authorities would play animportant part in a nationalised scheme.2. My proposals are founded on three essential features: the waterworks ofthe country should vest in the Minister of Health so that he can ensure the proper use and distribution of water resources; each unit of administration should cover a Ivide area so as to facilitate the supply of water to most areas at reasonable cost,and also so as to secure the best use of our technical experts and the most economicaluse of our man-power; there should be financial control at the centre so as toreduce the need for heavy Exchequer assistance. These features must in my view be retained, but subject to this I would agree that local authorities should be boughtinto the scheme to the fullest possible extent.3. I therefore propose the following arrangements for the consideration of mycolleagues:  All waterworks and property of water undertakers to be transferred to theMinister of Health; the arrangements for compensation to correspondbroadly with those approved for the gas and electricity undertakings,i.e., that the local authority property should be taken over without pay-ment other than the taking over of outstanding loan debts, and thatthe compensation to companies should be based on the quoted rate oftheir stock.The Minister to be responsible for the design and carrying out of newsupplies.An Area Authority to be set up for each of the areas into which, as pointedout in the previous papers, the country naturally falls for water adminis-tration purposes; this Area Authority to consist entirely of membersof local authorities in the areas and to be appointed by those authorities.(Group representation of the smaller authorities will be necessary if the size of the Area Authorities is to be kept within reasonable limits.)Area Authorities would be made responsible for the day-to-day adminis-tration in their areas and could be given a good deal of autonomy.They would manage the waterworks serving their areas; the water-works staff would be their servants and not civil servants; they would decide, subject to approval of budgets by the Minister, what extensions of distribution mains there should be in their areas; ordinary runningexpenses would be within their control.(The 53 areas referred to in the previous papers might have to be slightly increased under the altered scheme.)39952Copy No3 cabinet(1)(2)(3)
(4) Subject to specific Exchequer grants, the Minister to recover the wholeof his expenditure, on the taking over of waterworks property or on.new works, from the Area Authorities, in proportion to their waterconsumption.(5) The Area Authorities to be self-supporting, meeting their expenses (i&apos;.e.,their own maintenance costs and their contributions to the Minister)after allowing for income from trade supplies by levying water rates onV. their domestic consumers. The fact that they would have to be selfsupporting in this way would be a check on extravagance in staff andother maintenance costs.4. Financial Effect on Consumers. Because of the comparatively high costof distribution mains in rural areas, the effect of centralising responsibility forwaterworks and spreading the cost over the whole country, coupled with spreadingmaintenance costs over wide areas, would be to bring consumers&apos; charges in rural areas more into line with those in urban areas without any great change in the urban charges. If the Civil Service scheme were adopted and the cost of watersupply (both capital and maintenance), after allowing for income from tradesupplies, were met by a uniform water rate on all domestic consumers, it is estimatedthat the result would be a general water rate of approximately 10 per cent, onrateable value. In the large towns with the lowest rates (including deficiency rates)now paid by consumers the rates are Leeds 9 per cent., Manchester 9 per cent.,Liverpool 9 - 3 per cent, and Metropolitan Water Board 9 - 4 per cent.; in rural areas the rates are commonly as much as 20 per cent, and often a good deal more.Under the proposals in this paper, the charge on domestic consumers would beuniform throughout each administrative area; they would, however, vary from area to area, though the differences would not be large. Generally speaking, the newcharges in the more urbanised administrative areas would be slightly less than under the &quot; civil service &quot; scheme, while those in the more rural areas would be alittle greater. But the rural areas would still gain very substantially under theproposals in this paper, in comparison with the present position, as illustrated bythe estimated charges in the Norfolk and Suffolk administrative areas given in the annex to this paper.5.  Summary. I therefore ask my colleagues to agree :(a) to the transfer of the waterworks of the country to the Minister of Health,who will be responsible for the design and carrying out of all new water-works, and to the setting up of area authorities, comprising members appointed by local authorities, who will be responsible for the day-to-day administration of the water supply service for their areas, who willcollectively meet the waterworks expenditure of the Minister, and whowill be self-supporting meeting their expenses, after allowing for income from trade supplies, by water rates on their domestic consumers;. (b) to the drafting of the necessary Bill with a view to its introduction as soonas Parliamentary time permits and to the opening of discussions withthe Local Authority Associations on the details of the Bill.Ministry of Health, S.WA,15th January, 1951.
