DRAFT STATEMENT ON DEFENCE programme .     At the Brussels meeting of the North Atlantic Councilon 19th December my right hen. Friend the Foreign secretary said that,  in view of the urgent need to strengthen the defences of the free world, His Majesty&apos;s Government had decided to increase and accelerate their defence preparationsstill further and were considering what form and. directionthat increased effort should take.      I am now in a positionto give the House a broad indication of the scale of thenew defence rjrogramme which the Government have adopted.2.      I wish at the outset to reaffirm the -purposes whichthis programme is designed to serve and- support.     TheGovernment do not believe that war is inevitable.     their purpose is to prevent war.      But they believe that peacecannot be ensured unless the defences of the free world aremade sufficiently strong to deter aggression.     It is forthis purpose, and for this purpose only, that the government now think it right to take still further measures to increasethe state of preparedness of the Armed Forces,MAN-power,     As the House knows, the Government1s long-term plan for the Forces has been to build up, through the system ofnational service, trained re-serves in sufficient numbers to provide the necessary reinforcements in an emergency.But there has not yet been time to build up these essentialreserves from national service men who have finished theircolour service.     At the present moment the Forces are withoutthose reserves of officers and men with up-to-date trainingwhich they would require on mobilisation.
It.,     We have therefore decided to call up for 15 days&apos;training with the Army during the current year some235,000 reservists, officers and men.      The great majorityof these will be Class *ZT reservists, who were called up for service before the end of 1948.Of these, some 80,000 will do their training in theTerritorial units and. formations with which they wouldactually serve if war broke out0hO,000 reservists will be similarly called up fortraining in the Anti-Aircraft Command,About 115,000 reservists will be called up for trainingwith Active Army formations in the United Kingdom and with various technical and administrative units which would berequired in war to support our Forces overseas and in thiscountry.In addition, the Royal Air Force will recall for15 days&apos; training about 10,000 officers and men who will berequired to .man the Control and Reporting Organisation in emergency.     The men will be drawn from the Class  &apos;G&apos;reservists, which are the equivalent of the Army Class fZ!.5.     The Class fZ&apos;  and tGI reservists to whom I have referred, being trained men, will receive the normal regularrates of pay and allowances, together with a bounty of by arrangement with the Ministry of Labour, no Class  fZfor &apos; G&apos; reservist will be recalled who would be reservedfor industry in the event of general mobilisation.6.     Legislation will be introduced in the near future togive effect to these proposals.     The men to be called upwill be notified as early as possible,  and each man will begiven the maximum notice of the date on which he is to joinhis unit.     Arrangements will be made to give- sympathetichearing to cases of individual hardship,
7,      This is a selective call-up *     The purpose of the plan is&apos;to select those officers and men whose qualifications and experience in their rank, trade or arm of the Servicefit them to fill the existing gaps in the formations and units as they now stand.     The selection must thereforeinvolve some element of discrimination between man and man;for, if the plan is to achieve its purpose, the basis of selection must be the actual requirements of the Services.The officers and men selected will in fact be those who, by virtue of their qualities and experience, can best fulfil thecountry&apos;s need at this time.8,      We shall also call on some members of the Regular and auxiliary Forces to make their contribution.The Royal Navy will call up about 6,000 men from theRoyal Fleet Reserve for 18 months1 service, with the regular forces,The Navy will also need, for 18 months, about 600officers from the emergency list of the Royal Navy, theR.N.V.R. , or the R.N.V. S.R.      It is hoped that a goodproportion of the reservists concerned will be obtained bycalling for volunteers.The fighter squadrons of the Royal Auxiliary Air force are an essential part of the fighter defence of this country.The officers and men of these squadrons will be called upfor 3 months&apos; continuous training, which will enable themto take their place in the front line in the event.ofemergency.The Royal Air Force will also recall for 3 months&apos;refresher training about 1,000 aircrew reservists of theRegular and Volunteer Reserves.      In addition, about 200regular and volunteer reservists may be recalled for flyinginstruction duties for periods up to 18 months.     It is hopedthat a good proportion of these will be obtained by calling for volunteers^
9.      For the time heing&apos;it will he necessary to continuethe practice which, as the House knows, all three Servicesfound it necessary to adopt at the beginning of the fighting in Korea, of retaining regulars bejrond the normal expiry of their colour service.    But the additional period whichindividuals so retained will be required to serve, after the expiry of their colour engagement, will not exceed 13 months in the Royal Navy, between 12 and 18 months in the Army,and 12 months in the Royal Air Force,    The regular reservistsalready called up by the Navy and Army for the Koreanemergency will be released by those two Services after broadly similar periods of service.10.    The general purpose of all these plans is to make more-effective the Regular Forces now in being, and to ensure thatmobilisation,  if it became necessary,  could be carried out more rapidly and smoothly than would otherwise be possible.This applies particularly to the provision of the units andformations which would be required in the initial stages ofan emergency.    For the Navy,  the measures proposed will enablemore ships to be put into full commission,  and will enhancethe state of readiness of the Reserve Fleet..   They will enablethe Active Army to move more rapidly to a war footing in anemergency, and they will facilitate the rapid mobilisation of certain formations and units of the Territorial Army.For the Air Force,  they will enable the expansion of thefront line to be accelerated,  and provision to be made forthe additional training requirements both of the front line and of the reserves.-k-
PRODUCTION11,      As regards equipment, the Forces have for the  last five years lived largely on their stocks.      Our production programme must therefore be concentrated mainly uponincreasing our striking power,    &apos;If our plan is fullyachieved, expenditure on production for the Services in1951/52 will be more, than double the rate for the current year.      By 1953/5k it will be more than four times as great,By then we shall have quadrupled our annual output of tanks and combat aircraft.     We shall introduce new types of equipment as rapidly as possible.     New types of fighter aircraft will come into service in larger numbers duringthe next two years.     Production of the twin-enginedCanberra bomber will be increased,  and the first order isbeing placed for a four-engined jet bomber.      Combat vehiclesof new design will be introduced,  and there will be notableimprovements in the supply of new types of anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons and equipment.      The programme for building and converting ships to deal with the submarine and mining threats will be greatly &quot;accelerated.     We shall alsosee that the Services have the stores, clothing and equipment required to enable them to be roady for operationsimmediately upon mobilisation.12.      To secure the increased output, new capacity willhave to be created, particularly for tanks and jet engines.Authority has already been given for two additionaltank-factories and for several new production lines forthe most modern types of jet engine.     A further increaseof aero-engine capacity is now being planned.
13*    We Intend to carry out this production programme tothe limit of the resources under our control.    The completionof the programme in full and in time is dependent upon anadequate supply of materials;,  components and machine tools.In particixlar, our plans for expanding capacity dependentirely upon the early provision of machine tools, many ofwhich can only he obtained from the United States.    I am confident that we can count on the support of the UnitedStates Government in overcoming the difficulties of obtaining.the various supplies required for this programme.llu    The effort we are making is, of course, an integral part of North Atlantic defence and full account will be taken of it in any arrangements made, as a rosult of collective-action by the North Atlantic countries, for the equitable*      distribution of the economic burden of defence.13.    We also intend to accelerate as far as we can themeasures we already have in hand for accumulating stocks offood and raw materials, as an insurance against interruption of imports in war.    The limiting factor is not money butavailability of supplies, particularly as regards rawmaterials.    It will be our policy to make full use of the commodity Board machinery that is being set up followingmy visit to Washington.CIVIL DEFENCE. 16,    This defence programme is designed to deter aggression,and we have therefore placed the emphasis upon the strengthening of the active defences.    There must belimits to, the resources which can be applied to defence purposes in time of peace, and we do not propose anygeneral acceleration of civil defence preparations.    We
shall, however, press on with civil defence planning; andwe shall accelerate those civil defence measures whichdirectly support the efficiency of the Armed Forces - inparticular,  communications, the control network and the warning system.    In addition, we shall begin to build upstocks of some of the essential equipment required by thecivil defence services, including the Fire Services andthe Hospitals and Emergency Medical Services.TOTAL COST17.    Over the whole field of military and civil preparations for defence, apart from the stockpiling programme,expenditure in the financial year 1951/52 will be in theneighbourhood of  1,300 millions.    It will take time tobuild up defence production to the levels which we now have in mind, and expenditure on production will be on a risingcurve during the next three years.    If the programme is fully achieved, tho total defence budget over the next threeyears,  covering all the military and civil preparations tutagain excluding stockpiling, may be as much as  h.700 millions,Nearly half of this will be for production.&apos;   ADMINISTRATION18.    This acceleration of defence preparations will involve an increased call on our already strained resourcesof experienced staff, administrative, technical and other.This requirement cannot be met without a diversion of effort from peace-time activities, and my colleagues will consider to what extent they can discontinue or retardpeace-time activities of their Departments in orderto free staff for defence work.    It may also be necessaryfor local authorities to make a similar diversion of effort to defence planning.
ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS19.     I will conclude by giving a broad indication of theeffect of this programme on our economy,,      This heavy and growing burden comes at a time when we already need afurther large increase in exports to meet our rapidly risingbill for imports.      In meeting this situation the Governmenthave one clear aim before them;    to see that we carry asmuch of the load as possible ourselves, now,  and refrain from mortgaging the future by running into debt abroad orreducing the investment on which our industrial efficiencydepends.     This will be a task of great difficulty becausethe industries which will have to carry most of the increaseddefence orders, the engineering and metal-using industries,are the very ones on which we have relied to make the biggestcontribution to exports and to industrial equipment,20.     This means that the measures we must now take willbe far-reaching and will affect every citizen and almost every industry.      There will have to be financial measuresto check civilian demand.      On these I will say nothing;the Chancellor of the Exchequer has them under consideration and will inform the House when he opens his Budget.      But,in addition, there will have to be a series of more dircteconomic measures.     Within the compass of this statement i can give only a broad outline of these, but it will be filled out in detail by Government spokesmen in the comingdebate.21,      Our most immediate task is to turn over the engineering industry, especially the sections producing aircraft, vehicles,radio and radar equipment and machine tools, to defence production.      Some new factories will have to be built,but for the most part we must rely on existing capacity.Much of the new work under the increased defence programme must replace work that is going on.      This will inevitably
reduce the exports of these industries, particularly nowwhen labour and materials are so scarce.      We must thereforecall on the rest of industry, in two ways.     First,  thelighter engineering industries, now producing goods for current consumption, will be called upon to take some of the strain off the heavier engineering industries by producingcomponents and so on under sub-contracts.     Secondly, these and other industries, such as the textile industry, willhave to expand their exports still further.      In this way we aim to maintain at least a balance in our overseasaccounts, at the expense primarily of home consumption,although some reduction in the supply of plant and machinerywill be inevitable.      There must also be some reduction inthe civil building programme, though we shall do our utmost to avoid widespread interference with it.22.     To achieve all this we shall have to reimpose manyof the controls used during the war.     Allocations of some*   raw materials have already been introduced;    others willprobably be necessary, to ensure that defence needs are met.Some less essential production, especially for the home market, will have to be reduced or stopped, by limitation ofsupply orders and the prohibition of certain end-uses.Factory and storage space will be requisitioned where necessary.     Some firms, for their own protection, willhave to be given directions about the volume of defenceorders which they must accept,, and the timing of these inrelation to other orders.      In this way we shall ensurethat the defence programme is carried through withoutintroducing the idea of &quot;an overriding priority&quot; for defence which,  as all our experience in the last war showed,creates more problems than it solves and produces bottleneckswhich very soon interfere with the whole production machine.Finally, if it proves at a later stage that compulsory measures are needed to provide labour in particular places we shall not hesitate to use them,
23.     This programme will have far-reaching effects on the pattern of industry,   , To carry it through effectively andsmoothly, the Government will need the fullest support&apos; andco-operation from managements and men.     They are confident that this will be forthcoming.      Both sides of industry.willbe taken fully into consultation at every stage of theprogramme,21)..     The Government have always recognised that a strong and healthy economy is an essential support for military strength;    and in preparing this programme they have weighedvery carefully its probable effect on the social and economicstandards of life in this country.      I make no attempt tc. deny that it must have its effect on our standard of living:we shall all have to make some sacrifices in the face of rising prices and shortages of consumer goods.     But, though theburden will be heavy, it is not more than we can bear.It will not destroy the remarkable recovery which we havemade in the last few years;    nor will it imperil the futurestrength of our economy.     We are confident that the greatproductive efforts which have made that recovery possiblewill be maintained and increased,  and that all sections ofthe community will give their full support to this nationaleffort to make ourselves strong enough to deter any attack upon our freedom and our way of life.
