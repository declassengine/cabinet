(51) 1415 th January, 1951CABINETORGANISATION OF FIRE SERVICES FOR WAR PURPOSESMemorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor scotland for the reasons explained below we have come to the conclusion that, in theevent of major war in Europe, it will be necessary again to nationalise the fire services. There have been preliminary discussions with representatives of theEnglish and Scottish local authorities, who have reacted not unfavourably. the associations for England and Wales have, however, asked for assurances that the fire Services would revert to local control on the restoration of peace and, in viewof the delicacy of this question both from the constitutional view-point and in thelight of the past history of the matter, we think it desirable to seek the concurrence of our colleagues in the course we propose to take.2. It will be remembered that under the Fire Brigades Act, 1938, the fireauthorities (subject to provisions for co-ordination) were the L.C.C.; elsewhere inEngland and Wales the county borough and county district councils; and inScotland the town or county council. But under the Fire Services (Emergency)Provisions Act, 1941, a National Fire Service was created for war purposes. Inthe course of the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill, the following statement was made by the then Home Secretary:  &quot; It is the very definite intention of the Government that it is a war-timeexpedient only, produced by war conditions. ... It is certainly my very definite view that after the war the fire-fighting forces should again be a localauthority service. ... It is only fair that this should be so. The brigadesare taken over for a war-time purpose; and I do not think there is any reason why, after the war, they should not again become a local service, subject tothe State then making provision for mobilisation on a national basis in theevent of a new emergency.&quot;3. Mr. Morrison made no suggestion that the Fire Services should revert tothe same 1,660 authorities who had control of fire brigades before the war, and as early as 1944 discussions were commenced with the Local Authority Associationsas respects the post-war organisation of the Fire Service. It was found that the associations representing the pre-war fire authorities in England and Wales werenot prepared to entertain any idea of the retention of a nationalised service and pressed for reversion to the pre-war basis. In Scotland this was the majority view.There were, however, strong grounds for holding that modern technical develop-ments necessitated the organisation of a peace-time Fire Service in much largerunits of control, and in 1946 the Government decided that, notwithstanding theviews of the Local Authority Associations, the Service should be transferred inEngland and Wales to the control of councils of counties and county boroughs (with suitable provision for special arrangements to meet the needs of particular areas)and in Scotland to the councils of counties and large burghs organised in elevenareas, within each of which there would be a single operational unit under joint39960
local authority administration or, in the case of Glasgow, under the administrationof the Town Council. The memorandum (CP. (46) W) in which this conclusion was placed before the Cabinet included the following passage:  &quot; 4. We do not think that there can be any doubt that, for purposes ofwar, it is essential that the Fire Service should be a National Service, and wethink that the experience which has been gained during the war justifies theconclusion that, for purposes of peace-time fire-fighting, the most efficientorganisation would be a national one. We think, however, that for peace-timepurposes it would be possible to organise an adequate Service on a localauthority basis, provided that it is organised in larger units than those which existed before the war.&quot;4. Effect was given to the above decision in the Fire Services Act, 1947,and in general fire-fighting arrangements are now satisfactory for normal peace-time requirements; but there are strong grounds for considering them inadequate to meet war-time needs-id) The repeated and concentrated raids on the larger centres of population in1940-41 showed that the resources of even the largest and best organisedlocal brigades were insufficient for dealing with the fire situationsarising: too long a time elapsed before reinforcements could be broughtinto operation at fires and there were far too few officers to controloperations at the multiplicity of fires which rapidly developed.ib) Even more serious fire-fighting problems may be expected in the eventof future incendiary or atomic attacks: in both types of attack firesmay be started over a very large area within a very short period andmay be associated with an amount of structural damage far exceedinganything ever experienced in this country.id) Emergency fire-fighting arrangements must be so planned as to enablereinforcements to be sent on a large scale to any area subjected to a heavy air attack. The greater part of the whole-time manpower andequipment that may be allocated from national resources for the pur-pose of emergency fire-fighting should therefore be organised intomobile fire columns, which will generally be situated outside of themain centres of population, but will be available for duty anywhere in the country. In our view the planning, organisation and control ofthese reserves cannot be handled by any local authority or any combina-tion of local authorities.id) The success of fire-fighting operations depends very largely on the controlexercise^ by officers at the scene of the fire, and fire-fighting calls fora high proportion of officers to other ranks. Experienced officers will therefore be needed in the mobile columns and able senior officers willbe needed to supervise and organise the columns and, if the need arises,to mobilise reinforcements over a wide area. The emergency organisa-tion will therefore necessitate a large-scale redistribution of officers ofexisting brigades and this will call for a degree of flexibility in theorganisation which, in our view, cannot be secured on any basis otherthan nationalisation.ie) The possibility must also be considered that a state of emergency may arise before we have the manpower trained or the equipment necessaryto give effect to these plans. In such a case it may be necessary towithdraw most or all of the fire-fighting resources in some districts forthe better protection of the main industrial centres. To enable this tobe done the rights and duties of fire authorities should be placed onthe Government.5. Our conclusion, therefore, is that plans should be prepared for theorganisation of a war-time service broadly on the lines on which the nationalisedservice operated during the last war and that legislation should be drafted for presentation to Parliament if the necessity arises, which will give substantially thesame powers as the Fire Services (Emergency) Provisions Act, 1941. Until, how-ever, a state of emergency arises or until the Fire Service is nationalised, the mainburden of the work of expanding Fire Services for war purposes will fall on FireAuthorities and their help and goodwill will be required not only in the work of expanding the strength of the Fire Service, but in preparing plans for the controland administration of the emergency organisation, including the procedure to be
established for the appointment of officers in the organisation and the arrange-ments to ensure a quick and smooth transfer of control.6. The representatives of Fire Authorities in England and Wales have specifically -cally asked for an assurance that, if the Fire Services were nationalised, they wouldrevert to the control of the authorities established under the Act of 1947 on therestoration of peace. The representatives of Scottish Fire Authorities regardnationalisation as necessary for war purposes and a minority have expressed theview that if the service is nationalised it should continue in a nationalised form inpeace-time.7. For the reasons indicated in paragraph 5, it is most important that FireAuthorities should co-operate to the full in the plans to be made, and any fearsthey may have regarding our intentions in preparing plans to nationalise the fire service should clearly be allayed so far as possible. Nevertheless, we consider itwould be unwise to make any statement which might appear to commit any future government as to the course of action it may see fit to take in regard to theorganisation of the Fire Services on a cessation of hostilities, which in the light of experience cannot be assumed to mean an enduring establishment of world peace.8. We accordingly propose to inform the Local Authority Associations thata decision to prepare plans for the nationalisation of the Fire Service for emergencypurposes in no way alters our view that the organisation as it has been established under the Act of 1947 provides an adequate service for peace-time needs and that,if powers to nationalise the Service are sought, they will be limited to what is.required for war purposes or in preparation for a state of war and will not affectthe fire service organisation after any war for which they might be used. The point is, however, one on which it is very difficult to avoid prejudicing either the present or the future, and we should be glad to have the concurrence of our colleagues inthe course we propose.J. C. E.H. McN.15th January, 1951.
