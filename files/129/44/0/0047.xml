(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET&apos;   CP.(51) 47 COPY-NO.       3l9TH FEBRUARY, 1951CABINETPACIFIC defence memorandum by the Minister of state the Problem:As my colleagues will be aware, Mr. Dulles, who has been charged by President Truman with the task of preparing the ground for a japanese peace Treaty, is at present making an exploratory tour in the Pacific area.In Tokyo he has had informal talks with the United Kingdom political representative, in which he has disclosed certain proposals regardingdefence areas in the Pacific.     These proposals are very briefly as follows:that there would be a Pacific Defence Council, consisting of the UnitedStates, Japan, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand;    the mainlandcountries of South-East Asia would be excluded, and so would the UnitedKingdom, which, however, might be associated with the Defence Council ona consultative basis.2. Mr. Dulles will discuss these proposals with the Australian andNew Zealand Governments in talks due to begin in Canberra on 15thFebruary.     Although Mr.  Dulles describes his proposals as purely personal,we know that they have been seriously, considered in the State Department,and H.M. Ambassador in Washington has told us that the United States view on them will probably crystallise about the time of Mr. Dulles&apos; visit toAustralia.3. The problem is analysed in further detail in the Annex to this paper.Recommendations:4. I invite my colleagues to agree:-(a) With the view set forth in Commonwealth Relations Office telegramNo.  87 to Canberra, which points out the objections to a Defence Councilexcluding the United Kingdom and the mainland countries of South-East Asia,and urges that instead an attempt should be made to explore the possible alternative means of meeting the very understandable Australian and NewZealand requirement for safeguards, for instance, by obtaining a UnitedStates guarantee of their security (see paragraph 7 of Annex).(b) That the United Kingdom High Commissioners in Canberra andWellington should be authorised to convey to the Australian and New zealand governments the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government on this point.
(c) That, whether or not it can be arranged for Sir Esler Dening(who is due to arrive in Canberra about 14th February) to be associatedwith the tripartite talks there, he should in any case be instructed to convey the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government to Mr. Dulles in Canberra.(d) That H.M. Ambassador in Washington skould similarly be instructed to convey the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the UnitedStates Government.K.G.Y.Foreign Office, S.W.1,9TH FEBRUARY, 1951.
ANNEX- PACIFIC DEFENCEIntroductionOn 2nd January, 1951, the Cabinet approved the proposals in thememorandum by the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence(CP.(50) 318) on the security aspects of the Japanese Peace Treaty(CM.(51) 1st Conclusions, Minute 4).    In this paper the following view was expressed (paragraph 15 of Annex):   &quot;A Regional Defence Pactcovering the Pacific and South-East Asia, would satisfy Australian andNew Zealand demands for security, would permit collective action inpeace and would enable Allied forces to be deployed in accordance withAllied grand strategy in war;   a regional defence pact should thereforebe the military aim.     The attitude of the Asian Powers towards theWestern Powers and American fears of a charge of imperialism are such that a regional pact is at present politically impracticable and must remain a long-term policy. &quot;2. This paper was circulated in January last to the Conference of commonwealth Prime Ministers, who duly noted the views expressed.Mr.  Dulles&apos; view. On 12th January Mr.  John Foster Dulles, who had been appointedby President Truman to deal with the preparations for a Japanese peace treaty, with the rank of Ambassador, had a conversation with H.M.Ambassador in Washington in which he developed his ideas regardingthe Peace Treaty and the interrelated question of Pacific Defence inconnection with the tour of Japan, the Philippines, Australia and NewZealand, on which he was due to start ten days later (see washington telegram No.  129 of 12th January).     From this and subsequent conversa-tions, ithas become clear that Mr. Dulles is thinking of incorporatingJapan in an island or &quot;off-shore&quot; group including also Australia, NewZealand, Indonesia (if she were willing), the Philippines and the UnitedStates (as possessor of the Aleutian Islands and as future possessor underthe Japanese Peace Treaty of the Ryukyu Islands), which countries would meet as a Pacific Defence Council with provision for general consultation on common defence problems.     Mr. Dulles believes that it would be bestfor the United Kingdom not to participate in this organisation, since ithas no possessions in the same group or chain of islands.     Moreover, ifthe United Kingdom were included, he considers that this would make itdifficult to exclude France, the Netherlands and Portugal (the implicationbeing that this would be undesirable as giving the impression that theDefence Council was designed as a bulwark of &quot;colonialism&quot;).      Therewould, however, Mr. Dulles considers, be room for a broader participa-tion, on a consultative basis, including countries which, though notterritorially represented in the area, possessed sea and air power, andthere would be legitimate reasons for the United Kingdom&apos;s participationon this basis.     Mr. Dulles is thinking, not of a formal instrument likethe North Atlantic Pact, but of a declaration to the effect that the islandsmaking up the &quot;chain&quot; were so interdependent that an attack on one linkwould be a matter of serious threat to the other links.     The broad objec-tive is to reconcile a Japanese Treaty which, by allowing Japan again tobecome a prosperous nation, and eventually a first-class Power, would keep her out of the Communist camp, with the very natural requirement ofAustralia and New Zealand in these circumstances for an assurance pfprotection against a resurgence of Japanese aggression.     The foregoing is asummary of Mr. Dulles&apos; ideas on the subject as reported in several interviews
either by himself to H,M. Ambassador in Washington or the UnitedKingdom Political Representative in Tokyo (see paragraph 5 below), orby other United States officials.Views of the Chiefs of Staff4. As soon as it began to appear that Mr. Dulles was. thinking of aPacific defence organisation on these lines, the views of the Chiefs ofStaff were obtained on his proposal.     These were briefly as follows(CCS.(51) 21st Meeting, Minute 2):Advantages.(a) An assurance to Australia and New Zealand of United Statesprotection would be an undeniable advantage, but it could be obtainedwithout resorting to the elaborate machinery of a Pacific Defence Council.(b) The proposal might in time be used, by widening the membership of the Council, as a step towards our long-term military aim of a RegionalDefence Pact, but see paragraph (e) below.(c) The proposal might help to counteract charges of imperialismagainst America.Disadvantages.(d) From the point of view of the United Kingdom&apos;s position as a world Power, the proposal would be interpreted in the Pacific, and else-where as a renunciation of our responsibilities and possibly as evidenceof a rift in policy between us and the United States.     There would undoubtedly be grave repercussions in Hong Kong and Malaya.(e) At present the exclusion of the Asiatic mainland countries would encourage Communist aggression against Malaya, Indo-China,Burma and Siam.(f) The existence of such a Council might cause the diversion of australian and New Zealand forces from vital theatres in war.(g) Any attempt towards initiating a Regional Defence Pact bywidening the membership of the Defence Council would be premature at   -present, as the Asiatic countries are not prepared for it and the powers concerned could not provide forces to make such a Pact effective.Conclusion.In the short term, the Dulles1 proposals for a Defence Cin their present form are unacceptable. Should conditions in theCommunist Asiatic countries become more settled, a more repreConsultative Pacific Defence Council might be a useful first stepa Regional Defence Pact.Mr. Dulles&apos; Talks with Sir A. Gascoigne.5. These views were telegraphed to the United Kingdom political representative at Tokyo, together with a telegram from the ForeignOffice endorsing them on the official level, particularly as regards the suggested exclusion of the United Kingdom, and authorising Sir A. Gascoigneto make full use of this material, on a purely personal and informal basis,in his talks with Mr. Dulles, in which, (on that basis) he was covering theouncilnon-sentativetowards
2i%whole range of the Japanese Treaty and related problems.Sir A. Gascoigne spoke accordingly to Mr. Dulles and succeeded inclarifying his ideas on the lines of paragraph 3 above.     Mr. Dullesalso emphasised that the ideas he had been putting forward were atpresent entirely his own.     This seems to be not entirely correct, as the ideas in question have also been expressed in conversation by other highUnited States officials, but it is probable that the United States Gevern-ment have not yet made up their minds to propose the establishment ofa Defence Council on the lines suggested.Mr. Dulles&apos; Talks with the Australian and New Zealand Governments. .6. Mr. Dulles is due to leave Tokyo on 11th February and to proceedvia the Philippines to Canberra, where he is due to arrive on 15thFebruary.     His plan is, after informal talks with the Australian Govern-   -ment, to proceed to Wellington and so return to the United States.     TheAustralian and New Zealand Governments may decide to hold their talks with him on a tripartite basis, in which case such talks would begin inCanberra on 15th February.     The Australian and New Zealand Govern-ments are holding preliminary discussions in Canberra, starting on 12thFebruary, about the line to be taken with Mr. Dulles.     They attachparticular importance to his proposals on Pacific Defence, and have asked for the earliest possible expression of an authoritative UnitedKingdom view.     In addition, the United Kingdom High Commissioner inWellington reported that the New Zealand Cabinet were to consider thematter on 9th February, and he therefore requested guidance beforehand.Preliminary Instructions to the United Kingdom High Commissioners.7. In the circumstances the question was urgently reviewed, in thelight of Sir A. Gascoigne&apos;s reports on his talks with Mr. Dulles, and atelegram was sent by the Commonwealth Relations Office to the UnitedKingdom High Commissioners in Canberra and Wellington on 6th February(telegram No.  87 to Canberra).     The telegram stated that we recognised the need of Australia and New Zealand to have assurances in the pacific area if they are to send forces to the Middle East and accept japanese rearmament, both of which are of great importance from the point ofview of the United Kingdom Government.     The telegram went on to say,however, that we have grave doubts about the Dulles&apos; proposals in theirpresent form for the reasons set out by the Chiefs of Staff (paragraph above), which were amplified on the following lines :-(a) A declaration of the kind proposed would equate an attack on Japanwith an attack on Australia or New Zealand and involve the commitment of australian and New Zealand forces for Japanese defence.     It would thuscut across Australian and New Zealand commitments to the Middle East.(b) It is very doubtful whether such a declaration could in practiceboth provide for the interdependence and mutual assistance of the countries of the group and at the same time provide against an attack by one member(Japan) on another (Australia or New Zealand).(c) We consider Indonesia&apos;s adherence to the Dulles&apos; plan unlikely.(d) The conclusion of a pact or declaration confined to the Hslandchain&apos; might have serious repercussions in countries not included, par-ticularly in South-East Asia.     The will to resist in Indo-China, Siam and malaya might be gravely affected.     The United Kingdom Government isparticularly anxious that whatever arrangement may emerge from these discussions should not be in such a form as to lead the populations of
:-\  243Hong Kong and Malaya to fear that the United Kingdom might be dis-interesting itself in their defence.     This effect would be intensified if,contrary to our expectations, Indonesia were included in the pact.    Itwould be hig&apos;bly dangerous to give the French any impression of abetrayal as regards Indo-China.    All this might both increase the threatin South-East Asia and leave defences there and south-eastward throughMalaya to Australia weakened.(e)     We want to keep in mind the long-term desirability of a pact orsystem of pacts including the countries of South-East Asia and ultimatelyIndia, Pakistan and Ceylom     This is not at present a practical propositionbut we are anxious to avoid any development which would make progress towards it more difficult.(fj     A &apos;white man&apos;s pact1 on the lines contemplated would operate against our efforts to secure closer co-operation from India, pakistan and Ceylon in South-East Asia, which is what we are trying to do throughthe Colombo Plan.(g)     It does not appear to be contemplated that the declaration should apply to United Kingdom islands such as Fiji and those of the western pacific High Commission.     Their inclusion would not help us in relationto the above difficulties but their exclusion would be equally difficult.8, As regards the position of the United Kingdom, the telegramreiterated that any arrangement which gave the impression of a renunciation-tion of our responsibilities in the Pacific, and perhaps also of a rift in policy between the United Kingdom and the United States, could not be welcome, either to the Commonwealth or to the United States.     The high commissioners were instructed to communicate these views to theAustralian and New Zealand Governments and, while expressing symapathy for their need for safeguards, to ask them, if they accepted our apprecia-tion, to make the foregoing points strongly in their informal talks withMr. Dulles, and to avoid committing themselves with him until there hadbeen an opportunity of consultation with the United Kingdom Government.The High Commissioners were further to suggest that the Australian andNew Zealand Governments might wish to try to obtain the required safe-guards by obtaining a United States guarantee of their security instead ofthe proposed Defence Council.     At the same time, High Commissionerswere told that we should welcome any suggestion by the Australian andNew Zealand Governments that the High Commissioners themselves, andSir Esler Dening, who is due to arrive in Canberra on 14th February,should be associated with the talks with Mr. Dulles.9. On 7th February, H,M. Ambassador in Washington reported thatMr. Satterthwaite, the Deputy Director of Commonwealth Affairs in theState Department, was due to leave about the 10th February to joinMr. Dulles in Australia, particularly to advise on Pacific Defence arrange-ments;   that Mr. Satterthwaite knew what Sir A. Gascoigne had told mr.. Dulles about the United Kingdom Chiefs of Staffls views and was anxious to know as soon as possible whether these views were endorsed byHis Majesty&apos;s Government.     Mr. Satterthwaite went on to say that no decision would be made until after Mr. Dulles&apos; report had been considered and further discussions held with friendly Powers.     Nevertheless., Sir OliveiFranks advises that our own views should be available at an early date, asit seems probable that the American view will crystallise about the time ofMr. Dulles&apos; conversations with the Australian authorities.10. A further point which could be made in amplification of the abovearguments it that the United Kingdom does in fact possess territory forming part of the island group or chain referred to, in the shape of North Borneo, .Brunei and Sarawak. .z
