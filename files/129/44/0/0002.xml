(51) 22nd January, 1951CABINETBALANCE OF CIVIL pay memorandum by the Minister of defence in the course of the Cabinefs discussion on the above subject on 7th December(CM. (50) 83rd Conclusions, Minute 3), I promised to circulate a note givingmy views on the Chancellors proposals considered from the point of view of the armed Forces.^ 2. Balance of civil pay has been issued to civil servants in the last three wars.The Chancellor of the Exchequer has reviewed the arguments for and againstabandoning this policy in any future war and finds them evenly balanced. we ought not to change our settled policy unless the case for so doing is made outbeyond reasonable doubt.3. The case for a change in policy has not been made out. Indeed, thearguments against it seem to me decisive.*4. It is, of course, true that Service pay has been much improved since thematter was last considered; but the main result of this increase is to reduce thecost to public funds of maintaining the present policy.5. It is argued further that by abandoning the present policy we put thecivil servant on a footing of equality with most other civilians called up for service with the colours. On the other hand, a great many other employers would continuethe present practice in spite of a change in Government policy, with the resultthrt. the Government^ standards would fall below those of the good employer.Moreover, we should have created a new inequality between the civil servantswho are called to the colours and those who are not.6. The Chancellor agrees that, if balance of civil pay were abolished, it wouldbe necessary to introduce modifications in the existing system of National ServiceGrants. But his proposals (set out in Appendix I to CP. (50) 274) would not cover all cases of hardship, or allay public anxiety. In particular, the figure of 500 as a maximum grant to be made under the scheme would not be adequatein present circumstances. But if the National Service Grants system were fullyextended the cost of the scheme, and of the organisation which it would benecessary to set up to administer it, would be so much increased as to reduce thevalue to the Treasury of abolishing balance of civil pay.? Moreover, I must point out that it is impossible to dissociate a disagreeable&quot; means&apos; test&quot; aspect from any system of National Service Grants.7. From the point of view of the Armed Forces there are several additionalobjections to abandoning the present policy:  (i) There would be an adverse effect on voluntary recruiting for the auxiliary forces of the men, say, between 25 and 35, who are badly needed inthese early days of building up those forces.(ii) The effect of the withdrawal of a much-prized concession by the Govern-ment would have an adverse effect on the favourable climate of opinion which we are trying to create as regards service in the Armed Forces.39871Copy No.
(iii) For some few years to come the Services will be absolutely dependent on very large numbersj of &quot; Z &quot;reservists to make&apos;up their numbers in thefirst few months of an emergency, before any new National Service act of wartime can produce trained men. There is already much misgivingamong large numbers of these reservists about their continued liability.-c v&apos;.&apos;.&apos;:&apos;- to be called up in an emergency. A large proportion of these men willhave received balance of civil pay in the recent war, and would no.doubt be confidently counting on receiving it if they were called up toserve in a future emergency. It may be expected to constitute a most;unsettling factor for this special but important class if they are nowdeprived of the prospect of balance of civil pay if they are called up again.8. If the Government should decide to abandon the issue of balance of civilpay thsy would be taking up a position which they would be unable to hold inwartime when tH full extent of the hardship to which the new policy gives risewould become apparent. We should then have got the-: worst of both worlds; weshould have incurred the odium of proposing the change now, only to be deniedthe financial saving on the outbreak of war.9. For these reasons I suggest we should be well advised to retain our existing policy.: : ,T   -..... .....\..-.&quot;:   .    r :    :     &apos;: ;.&apos;*&apos; : &apos;.    e. s..&apos; * Ministry of Defence, S.WJI,&apos;2nd January, 1951.
