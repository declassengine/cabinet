CiVa.    2/3 I-5TI     (5p&quot;*his DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET32CP. (51) 29 - COPY NO.23RD JANUARY, 1951CABINETSUPPLY OF NATIONAL SERVICEMEN TO MEETTHE NEEDS OF THE forces memorandum by the Minister of defence i have read the comments by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland in their memorandum(CP. (51) 23) on the proposal in the annex to the memorandum by theMinister of Labour on the supply of National Servicemen (C P. (51) 22) thatthe indefinite deferment of the calling up of young agricultural workers should be discontinued.2. It is true that on the basis of the figures shown in the annex to cp. (51) 22 the measures proposed by the Minister of Labour would produce more men than are required.    But the recent Cabinet decision(CM. (50) 87th Conclusions, Minute 1) to increase and accelerate our defence preparations still further has entirely altered the complexion of the problem.The revised man-power plans which have been put forward  to the Cabinetin accordance with this decision (CP. (51) 16) include a requirement for over200,000 National Servicemen during 1951/52.   This is made up as follows(the earlier requirements are shown in brackets):-1951/52.Navy                                 2,500 (2,000)Army                           1^9,000                    &apos; (119,000)R.A.F.                          53,000 (50,000)0Total                        20h,500 171,000The new R. A. F. figure assumes the retention of all regulars for sixmonths beyond the end of their engagements, and of certain categories forlonger;   and if the present improvement in regular recruiting is notmaintained an additional 2-3,  000 may be needed.(ft    This assumes the retention of regulars for six monthsbeyond the end of their engagements.
3. The revised supply and demand position is therefore likely to beas follows:-1950/51 2351/32Probable Supply 167,000 160,000Probable Demand 174,000 204,500Probable Shortage 7,000 44,500This means that the total shortage to be met between now and 1st April, 1952,is at least 50,000.    If, therefore, the new defence programme - on the progressof which intense interest will be focussed in the coming months - is not to be prejudiced by lack of man-power this gap must be closed.4. The proposals put forward in the annex to CP. (51) 22 -(i)   to change the present policy under which men working in agriculturedo no national service either with the Colours or on the reserve(which would yield 15,000 men);   and(ii)   for the Services to make greater use of medical rejects (which mightyield perhaps another 15,000 men)will not entirely close the gap.   The Chiefs of Staff iUi their report to theCabinet on the new defence programme (CP. (51) 16) have accordingly proposedthat the Ministry of Labour should consider some scaling down of the numbersof men to whom temporary deferments are granted.    This, of course, would only^be a stop-gap:   the men in question would have to give their servicesooner or later.5, My colleagues will see from the foregoing that the Minister ofLabour&apos;s proposal to amend the policy under which men working in agri-culture are completely absolved from national service is one of vital importanceto the defence programme.   In the circumstances which the Minister of labour has described I do not see how we can continue to grant complete immunityto these men at a time when we have been forced to raise the period ofnational service to two years, to recall large numbers of reservists tothe colours, to compel regulars to remain in the Services after they have completed their promised period of service, and are even proposing to recalllarge numbers of Class &apos;Z&apos; reservists for training.E. S.Ministry of Defence, S. W. 1. ,23rd January, 1951.
