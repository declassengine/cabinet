THIS   DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENT245Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1951SECRETfcopy No31CP. (51) 489th February, 1951CABINETSOVIET PROPOSAL FOR A MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OFFOREIGN ministers the text of the latest note from the Soviet Government to the three western powers is given in Annex A to this paper.2. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington has already had a preliminary discussion with the French and United States representatives about the line to betaken in replying to this note and his report is contained in Annex B. The first point that emerges from Sir Oliver Frank&apos;s telegram is that there was general agreement that the Western Powers&apos; reply to the Soviet note should be despatched as quickly as possible. This certainly seems desirable and to this end it is important that theCabinet should consider the matter in order that instructions may be sent toSir Oliver Franks Which will assist him in continuing his consultations.3. When the Cabinet last considered this question on Thursday, 1st February(CM. (51) 11th Conclusions, Minute 6), they again endorsed the line that hashitherto been followed by the three Western Powers in their correspondence withthe Soviet Government on this subject, namely, that we should not enter into any meeting with the Russians on an agenda limited to German questions alone. our last note to the Russians was designed to elucidate whether the Soviet government agreed that other questions which constituted the real causes of international tensionmight be discussed. The present Soviet reply is still obscure on this point. It statesthat, while the question of the demilitarisation of Germany is the most important matter for discussion, the Soviet Government considers possible the discussion ofother questions provided it is understood that the meeting would be a meeting of theCouncil of Foreign Ministers as constituted by the Potsdam Agreement and thatthe questions would be considered in the manner provided for by that Agreement.It is likely that the Soviet Government will argue, as they have argued in the past,that under the Potsdam Agreement the function of the Council of Foreign Ministersis limited to doing &quot; the necessary preparatory work for the peace settlements &quot; andthat, although there is a provision that other matters may from time to time bereferred to the Council by agreement between the member Governments, those other matters must also be related to the peace settlements. We must expect that by such means the Soviet Government will seek to limit the &quot; other questions &quot; to bediscussed at a four-Power meeting to German questions other than demilitarisation,and, possibly, to questions arising out of the peace settlements with the satelliteStates, Italy and Austria. It seems clear in any event that the Soviet Governmentwill seek to insist that the demilitarisation of Germany should be the first item onthe agenda and that the scope of other items be limited as narrowly as possible.4. For the rest, the latest Soviet note agrees that a preliminary meeting of therepresentatives of the four Powers should be held in Paris provided that the task of this meeting is limited to drawing up an agenda and deciding the order in whichthe items on the agenda shall be examined. Examination of the substance of thequestions on the agenda must be left to Ministers, but in this connexion the SovietGovernment agrees that any member of the Council has the right to introduce any proposals he wishes to make on questions that are on the agenda.Memorandum by Minister of State
5. The Soviet note repeats the attacks that have been made in earlier notes on Western plans for German rearmament, but contains more explicit referencesthan the earlier notes to Western rearmament generally and to the alarm and tensionwhich this is causing. It alleges that, while the four-Power meeting originally pro-,posed by the Russians in their first note of 3rd November is being indefinitelydelayed, accomplished facts are being created in Germany and elsewhere. It statesthat the Soviet Government has already stated its disapproval of a policy of accom-plished facts and adds that the Soviet Government cannot but call attention to the&quot; intolerability &quot; of the situation which has been created.6. On the assumption that an early reply is desirable, there are two alternativegeneral courses that might be followed.7. The first would be to base ourselves firmly on the assumption, which infact is probably the correct one, that the Soviet note does not constitute acceptanceof the Western Powers&apos; proposals for a wider agenda. We could say so in our reply, explaining our reasons, stand firm on our earlier attitude and insist that wecan only enter into preliminary discussions if the Soviet Government state quite clearly that they accept our conditions. There is much to be said, in dealing withthe Soviet Government, for standing firm on the position which we believe to be right: it is not to be excluded that, in their desire for a meeting, the Soviet Govern-ment will eventually accept our view.8. A second course, which seems generally in line with the preliminary viewsreached in Washington (see Annex B), would be the following: We could replyrebutting the allegations in the Soviet note that Western rearmament, and particu-larly the rearmament of Germany, is the main cause of international tension. Wecould correct the mis-statements of fact in the Soviet notes, for instance, the sug-gestion that German rearmament is already an accomplished fact and that general eisenhower has been conducting negotiations with the German Federal Govern-ment. We could re-emphasise that, on the contrary, it is Soviet actions and soviet policy since the war which are the real cause of international tension and the reasonfor present Western rearmament plans. We could explain in this connexion thatthe question of the demilitarisation of Germany and the recent defence preparationsof the North Atlantic Treaty Powers cannot be dissociated from the wider context of the great armaments maintained by the Soviet Union since the end of hostilitiesas contrasted with the drastic measures of demobilisation carried out by their allies -jthe building up of large armed forces by the so-called People&apos;s Democracies of eastern Europe; the rearming of Eastern Germany by the Soviet Union; and theconsistently maintained threats, overt and covert, by the Soviet Union and itssatellites to the security and well-being of the peoples of the free world. It couldbe argued that our defence measures cannot be properly understood by referencemerely to a single international instrument like the Potsdam Agreement which was concluded for a limited purpose and which was, in fact, disregarded and violatedby the Soviet Government in some of its. principal provisions almost from themoment of its conclusion.9. We could then take note of the various references in the Soviet note to thedesirability of removing differences between the four Powers and the causes of alarmand anxiety. We could note the Soviet Governments statement that all ministers will be free to introduce any proposals they wish on questions that have beenaccepted for examination. We could then go on to reiterate our own desire for ameeting on a wide agenda, that will deal with the real causes of international tension,and indicate that, just as the Soviet Government will presumably wish to raisethe general question of the increase in armaments, so also we shall certainly do so with particular reference to Soviet and satellite armaments in Eastern Europe andthe Soviet threat to the free world. Having made this statement of our intentions,we would say that we agreed to the holding of a preliminary meeting in Paris to draw up an agenda and would propose a precise date for such a meeting.10. The effect of a reply on these lines would be to place upon the SovietGovernment the onus of refusing after all to attend a preliminary meeting on the wider basis we suggest. It is more likely that in fact they will accept, but that,when they come to the meeting, their representatives will insist rigidly on a narrower,limitation of the subjects to be included On the.agenda than the Western powers could accept.   This being so, it must be recognised that the meeting may well break
down at the stage of the preliminary meeting and no meeting of Foreign ministers will be possible. This course, however, seems preferable to a break-down before any preliminary conference and it is recommended that the second course above should be followed even though it involves the risk of a break-down at the official level,  iK. G. Y.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,9th February, 1951.ANNEX a proposed MEETING OF FOREIGN MINISTERSText of the Reply of the Soviet Government to the United KingdomGovernment^ Note of 23rd January, 1951In connexion with the Note of the British Government of 23rd January, 1951,the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the U.S.S.R. has the honour to state thefollowing.1. The fulfilment of the decisions of the Potsdam Agreement on the questionof the demilitarisation of Germany and the removal of differences in the positions of the&quot; four Powers on this question are of the greatest importance for lessening thepresent tension in the international situation and would undoubtedly contributeconsiderably to the improvement of relations between Great Britain, the UnitedStates, France and the U.S.S.R.Nevertheless the New York Conference of the Foreign Ministers of GreatBritain, the^ United States and France in September 1950, and the ensuing measuresof the Governments of the three Powers have been definitely directed towards the revival in Western Germany of a regular German army and to such an enormousincrease of armaments in Europe and United States, of America as is causing evergreater alarm among peoples who only recently suffered the shocks and disastersof the second world war.It was for this very reason that the Soviet Government as early as3rd November last year took the initiative in calling the Council of foreign ministers for a discussion of the question of the demilitarisation of Germany.Since the British Government, like the Governments of France and the UnitedStates, also declares its desire for a material improvement in the relations betweenGreat Britain, France, the United States and the Soviet Union, and also for theremoval of the causes of the international tension which at present exists, the SovietGovernment considers that in this event there should be no grounds at all forfurther postponement in calling the Council of Foreign Ministers.2. The Soviet Government cannot overlook what has been happening in recent months before the eyes of everyone. If the New York Conference of the ministers of the three Powers merely brought forward the question of the revival of german armed forces and the restoration of war industry in Western Germany since thattime the real significance of this decision of the three Powers has already becomerevealed in many respects.It is known to the whole world that the Governments of Great Britain, theUnited States and France bh the one hand have for more than a month now beenconducting far-reaching negotiations with the Bonn Government Of Adenauer onthe other, the dangerous significance of which is clear to all the peace-loving peoples of Europe.In this connexion it is necessary also to note the fact of the negotiations between general Eisenhower and the Government of the revanchist Adenauer concerning theinclusion of a revived German army as part of the so-called &quot; joint armed forces &quot;and also the appointment itself at the present moment of General Eisenhower as commander-in-Chief of these armed forces which in no way accords with officialstatements concerning a desire for peace.
There is nothing surprising in the fact that because of this very situation in western Germany extreme militarists and revanehistes are raising their heads, andthe Hitlerite lackeys of yesterday among the most aggressive elements are acquiringgreat weight.The present intentions to utilise revived German armed forces as the obedientweapon of a certain group of Powers are founded on shaky ground since under theprotection of the Government of revanchistes of the Adenauer-Schumacher kindsnow in Western Germany, militarists of the Hitlerite succession, enraged by theirfailures and wanting themselves to utilise the situation which has been created fortheir own aggressive imperialistic aims, are strengthening their influence and directdomination more and more.The circumstances furthermore that in a number of European States and in theUnited States of America the increases in armies and the armaments race have assumed unheard-of proportions is naturally in many respects intensifying thestrained international situation and anxiety among the peoples. A situation hasbeen created in which the conference of Foreign Ministers for one reason or anotheris being postponed longer and longer and in addition to this not only is the de militaires-tarisation of Germany not being carried out but on the contrary measures are beingtaken to revive a regular German army and war industry in Western Germany andalso numerous other measures aimed at hurried preparations for a new war.If such a situation continues further the Conference of Foreign Ministers will clearly be confronted with accomplished facts. The Soviet Government has already declared its attitude of disapproval to such a policy of accomplished facts.It is possible that such a policy corresponds to the desires of some or otheraggressive circles, but the Soviet Government cannot but call attention to theintolerability of the situation which has been created.3. In its Note, the British Government states that it considers it necessaryto,ask for an explanation on certain questions touched upon in the previous note of the Soviet Government. In particular, the British Government enquires whetherthe Soviet Government agrees to discuss besides the question of the demilitarisationof Germany other questions also, although the British Government on this occasionis again silent concerning which questions precisely it has in mind. The SovietGovernment considers possible also the discussion of other questions at the sessionof the Council of Foreign Ministers keeping in view that these questions will be examined by the Council of Ministers as constituted by the Potsdam Agreementbetween the U.S.S:R., the United States, Great Britain and France [sic] and in themanner provided for by that agreement. As far as the observation of the BritishGovernment is concerned, to the effect that the Prague Declaration cannot beaccepted as a basis for discussion, the position of the Soviet Government on thisquestion has already been set out in its Note of 30th December, 1950.It goes without saying that the Soviet Government proceeds in this connexionfrom the equal right of all members of the Council of Foreign Ministers to introducefor discussion by the Council any proposals on questions which shall be accepted for examination.4. The British Government in its Note of 23rd January raises the questionof the tasks of the preliminary conference of representatives of the four Powers.The position of the Soviet Government on this question was also set out in itsNote of 30th December, 1950.The Soviet Government considers that the preliminary conference of repre-sentatives of Great Britain, the United States, France and the U.S.S.R. must be-limited to drawing up an agenda including the establishment of the order of examination of questions.Thus the examination of the substance of the questions to be included in theagenda must not enter into the tasks of the preliminary conference.5. The Soviet Government has no objection to the calling of the preliminary conference of representatives of the four Powers in Paris. The Soviet Governmentis sending similar notes simultaneously to the Governments of the United Statesand France.
ANNEX B .PROPOSED MEETING OF FOREIGN MINISTERSText of Telegram No. 367 of 6th February from His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in WashingtonAt Jessup&apos;s request there was a special meeting first thing this morning at theState Department to exchange preliminary views on the Soviet reply, which wasreceived overnight. We all stressed views were personal and without commitment.2. The following points were made and received a measure of general assent: (A) We should despatch our reply as quickly as possible.(B) The reply should start with a short sharp rebuttal of the charges in thefirst two paragraphs of the Soviet Note, laying the blame for the present state of tension in the world on the weight of Soviet armaments andaggressive Soviet policy.(C) Soviet purpose was obviously to enter the preliminary official and subse-quent ministerial meetings, having committed us to the &quot; demilitarisation-tion of Germany &quot; specifically and the German problem generally asthe sole mandatory subjects, anything else to be on the agenda only by unanimous agreement.(D) To counter this and also the imputation that we have not indicated &quot; pre-cisely what questions are concerned &quot; on our side, it was felt that we ought now to give some indication of some of the items we insist onhaving on the agenda. In doing so, we should no doubt wish to reserveour position on the question whether or not the meeting will be a Councilof Foreign Ministers. In this way we might ensure that, when the deputies meet, our representatives can work on a basis laid down inan official communication to the Soviet Government. Our items neednot, of course, be formulated precisely in the terms in which we would wish to see them inserted on the agenda.(E) We should state precise date on which we are prepared to meet in Paris.(F) Jessup seemed anxious to include a reference looking towards an eventualmeeting of the Foreign Ministers in the United States, probablyWashington. We reserved our position on the desirability of includingthis at this stage.3. The Americans were very suspicious of the note, especially with referenceto the agenda, and even feared that we might be lured into a position where wecould not refuse to discuss German items alone. While therefore they more or lessaccepted the inevitability of a preliminary conference and also a full conference inthe end they showed signs of sticking to their original thesis that we were not boundto enter the latter unless there is agreement on a suitable agenda. They may there-fore wish to put in something to indicate this though only with the idea of strengthen-ing their hand in the preliminary conference. The French were, of course, decided in favour of entering the preliminary and the full conference, but they too hadmisgivings on the agenda.4. State Department are very anxious to restrict comment in the three capitalswhich might indicate any difference of view on the Soviet Note. They propose totake the line that it is a typical Soviet document, that there has been a preliminaryexchange of views in Washington, that the note is being studied, and that commentwould be premature, especially as it has not yet been published.May I have early instructions, if possible, in time for meeting on the afternoon of 7th February.
