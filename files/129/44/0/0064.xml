IrHlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT).E C R E TCP.(51) 64COPY NO.   t27TH FEBRUARY, 1951CABINETPACIFIC DEFENCENote by the Prime minister as my colleagues may be aware, talks have just been concluded in Canberra between Mr. Dulles, on behalf of the United States Govern-ment, and the Ministers for Externa.1 Affairs of the Governments ofAustralia and New Zealand, on the general subject of the Japanese peace treaty, with specific reference to the related question of PacificDefence (see CP.(51) 47).2. We have now received from the New Zealand and australian government a copy of a draft tripartite treaty between the United Statesof America, Australia and New Zealand prepared for consideration bythe Governments concerned during the talks in Canberra.     It appearsthat this treaty will for the time being be restricted to Australia, NewZealand and the United States of America, with the possible inclusion,at United States insistence, of the Philippines.3. The question that I should wish my colleagues to consider is whether or not the draft Treaty is satisfactory from the United Kingdompoint of view, and if so, whether His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom should seek to be a party to it.     The political aspects of theproblem are set out in the annexed memorandum. /4. The question has also been examined by the Chiefs of Staff, whose views are contained in Appendix &apos;C to the memorandum.5. I now invite my colleagues to agree that -(a) the draft Treaty is generally acceptable;(b) we should be prepared to accept the exclusion of the UnitedKingdom from the Treaty, but in this event, we should much prefer to see the Treaty confined to the three originalsignatories;(c) the Governments of Australia and New Zealand should beinformed accordingly and their comments sought;(d) further discussion with the United States should be deferred pending replies from Australia and New Zealand.C  R .jri- .1.0, Downing Street, S.W.1,
annex memorandum by the&apos; Prime MinisterIntroduction1. On 12th February the Cabinet had before them a paper by theMinister of State (C.P.(51) 47) on the subject of proposals which had then been put forward by Mr. Dulles on behalf of the United States fora Pacific Defence Council consisting of the &quot;Island Chain&quot; of the UnitedStates, Japan, the -Philippines, Indonesia, Australia and New Zealand.That paper recognised that it was highly desirable that Australia andNew Zealand should obtain a security guarantee from the United Statesbut explained that there were a number of grave objections to thearrangements then contemplated.     The Cabinet endorsed the views expressed in the paper and recommended that every effort should bemade to find alternative means of meeting the Australian and NewZealand requirement for safeguards.    The Governments of Australiaand New Zealand and Mr. Dulles were so informed.The Draft Treaty2. We have received from the Government of New Zealand, andsubsequently from the Government of Australia, a copy of a draft tri-partite treaty between the United States, Australia and New Zealandwhich was prepared for consideration by the Governments concernedduring Mr. Dulles1 talks with Australian and New Zealand Ministers at canberra on the 15th, 16th and 17th February.     A copy of the draft isattached at Appendix &apos;A&apos;.     It appears that the earlier &quot;Island Chain&quot;proposals have been dropped in favour of this simpler and more limitedagreement.     We have, however, been informed that the United states may wish to press for the inclusion of the Philippines as a fourth partyto the Treaty.3. The United Kingdom High Commissioner at Canberra has receiveda letter from the Australian Prime Minister (copy attached as Appendix&apos;B&apos;) in which Mr. Menzies explains the very great importance which theAustralian Government attach to the conclusion of such a treaty and make sit clear that his Government expect the United Kingdom Government to do their best to help the Australian and New Zealand Governments to securethe completion of a treaty on the lines proposed.     The Australian resident minister in London has, on instructions, presented a note similarlyemphasising the Australian viewpoint and criticising, in somewhatexaggerated terms, some of the views expressed in C.P.(51) 47.     Thesecriticisms are on matters of detail and the Cabinet need not be concernedwith them.Views of the Chiefs of Staff4. The draft treaty has been examined by the Chiefs of Staff whose views are set out in Appendix &apos;C.     In brief the Chiefs of Staff regard the treaty as generally acceptable.     They recognise that there is a danger that such a treaty might in some degree divert Australian and New Zealandinterest from the defence of the Middle East to-the Pacific, but they feelthat such limited risks of this kind as there are should be accepted inview of the undoubted strategic advantage which an American guarantee of Australian and New Zealand security provides.     The Chiefs of Stafftake the view that, provided that the&apos; arrangements are confined to the
b.(a)(b)(c)9.(a)(b)United States, Australia and New Zealand, the United Kingdom need notbe a party to the treaty or a member of the Defence Council which it isproposed to set up.     They add, however, that the United Kingdom should seek to be included should the treaty be extended to other, countries, e. g.if the United States insist on the inclusion of the Philippines.     TheChiefs of Staff also suggest that, after consultation with the australian and New&apos;Zealand Governments, Lord Tedder should be instructed to urgeon the United States that the present agreed global strategy should notbe prejudiced.Political Comments5. Having regard to these factors, I agree with the Chiefs of staff that the treaty is generally acceptable.6. As regards the risk of prejudice to our global strategy whichmight be involved, I endorse the Chiefs of Staff suggestion that lord tedder should be instructed to obtain an assurance about global strategyfrom the United States Chiefs of Staff, and that this should be done afterthe Governments of Australia and New Zealand have been consulted.Inclusion of the - United kingdom. From the broad political view the question whether or not theUnited Kingdom should be included is a major one, and. I should thereforelike my colleagues to consider the arguments for and against.Arguments for the inclusion of the United KingdomOur exclusion might tend to give the impression, in countries inSouth-East Asia and even possibly in Australia and New Zealand,that the United Kingdom was renouncing its responsibilities inthe Pacific.It might even be argued that it was symptomatic of a rift in policybetween the United Kingdom and the United States in that area,or of undue subservience by the United Kingdom to the UnitedStates.To give an impression of retreat in the Pacific would do harm tothe United Kingdom&apos;s influence and credit in other parts of theworld by seeming to diminish our stature as a world Power.Arguments against the inclusion of the United KingdomIt is in our interests that a treaty should be concluded, since itmeets Australian and New Zealand security requirements.But it is by no means certain that the United States government or Congress will accept it.     There will be greater prospects ofsuccess if we support Australia and New Zealand, as theAustralian Government have strongly urged us to do, in backingthe draft treaty as it stands.     An attempt to secure ourown inclusion might have the opposite effect.There are ways and means open to us which should forestall anyfalse impressions such, as those foreseen in the preceding para-graph     e. g. by way of a Governmental statement at theappropriate time on the analogy of the statements of friendly
interest arid welcome which were made by a number of other commonwealth Governments when the United Kingdom enteredWestern Union.(c) &apos; The inclusion of the United Kingdom would raise the same sort of difficulties as we foresaw in the &quot;Island Chain&quot; proposals -the inclusion of Malaya and Borneo would emphasise the exclusion of other neighbouring territories and might be expectedto provoke the French Government to press for the extension ofthe pact to their territories.(d) As the Chiefs of Staff have pointed out, it. is right that we shoul drely on the normal processes of Commonwealth consultationto ensure that our interests are represented.     It is a specifically -cally Australian view of the modern evolution of the Common-wealth that individual Commonwealth countries should take the lead on behalf of the whole Commonwealth in areas where they themselves are specially concerned.     In line with this conceptthey recognise that the United Kingdom should take the lead inthe North Atlantic and the Middle East and we have recognisedthat Australia is in the lead in relation to the occupation ofJapcin.     It could be argued that this is not inconsistent with united Kingdom signature of the treaty since Australia would inany case take the lead in so far as arrangements under the treaty would be centralised in Canberra;     But it would be appropriate,and helpful for our general relations with Australia, if, in the context of a Pacific pact, we were to indicate our acceptance of australian and New Zealand leadership in the Pacific andemphasise that we look to them to represent our own interests as well as theirs.10.        The problem would be more difficult if the United States v/ere to insist on the inclusion of the Philippines.     We should try to avoid this ifwe can.     It raises difficulties not only for our own territories but also for other territories in Soxith-East Asia.11.        In any case it would not be appropriate for the United Kingdom to rely upon &quot;associate member ship&quot; under Article VIII of the draft as a means of securing a voice in the Council.Comments on the Drafting of the Treaty12.        From thelegal point of view, there are certain ambiguities in thedraft:(a) The &quot;Pacific area&quot; is not defined-.     This is an essential point which would seem to need clarification.-(b) There are no provisions concerning the constitution (other thanmembership) of the Council to be set irp under Article VII, and no pro-vision for future determination of such questions as the method of taking decisions, and how far such decisions would be binding.(c) There is no definition of the position of countries which retire from the Council under Article X.
Generally speaking, the draft as such seems designed tofacilitate collective action, while studiously avoiding all really bindingobligations..    The looseness of the draft in this respect may have theadvantage from, the United Kingdom points of view of enabling Australiaand New Zealand, if they wish to, to avoid becoming too tied up withdefinite commitments which would prevent them from carrying out their obligations outside the Pacific.     Of these points, only (a) above wouldseem worth bringing to the notice of the Australian and New zealand governments.C.R.A.10, Downing Street, S.W.1,2 7TH FEBRUARY, 1951.

APPENDIX  &apos;B&apos;TEXT OP LETTER DATED 2 2ND - FEBRUARY -FROM MR.  MENZISSTO UNITED KINGDOM HIGH COMMISSIONER IN CAMBERRAI need hardly say that the Commonwealth Govern-ment constantly bears in mind in entering into importantnegotiations with the representative of any foreign country notonly the interests of Australia but the interests of theBritish Commonwealth as a whole and in particular those of theUnited Kingdom.    The talks with Mr. Dulles were from the firstdescribed by Mr. Dulles himself as &quot;exploratory talks&quot;.    Wehave throughout taken the view that there would, be ample time for &apos;consultation with the United Kingdom, before any decisions were reached on the matters under discussion.Secondly.    The proposal regarding a pact ordeclaration including &quot;island chain&quot; countries that is to say Japan,the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand and possibly Indonesiahas throughout been the United States proposal and not an australian proposal.    Clearly a simpler arrangement includingas parties only the United States, Australia and New Zealandwould be preferable from the point of view of Australia.Before the talks with Mr. Dulles opened however we had considerable doubt as to whether the United States would have any real desire to enter into such a limited arrangementparticularly in view of their defence responsibilities inregard to the Philippines and -Japan.    In the result as yourrepresentatives in Canberra have already been informed orally adraft Treaty was prepared for the consideration of the Govern-ments of Australia, New Zealand and the United States of whichthe first paragraph of Article IV is as follows &quot;each partyrecognises that an armed attack in the Pacific area on any ofthe parties would be dangerous to its own peace and safety anddeclares that it would  act to meet the common danger inaccordance with its constitutional processes.&quot;   A copy of thefull text of the draft Treaty is attached herewith.  (Appendix &apos;A .)My Government regards the adoption of a Treaty ofthis kind as of the first importance and takes it for granted that the United Kingdom Government will lend its utmost efforts in achieving this end.    It is my firm belief that the Treaty inits present form does not conflict with United Kingdom interests:so far as Australia is concerned its adoption would of course bean outstanding contribution to the security of Australia andNew Zealand and thus facilitate the carrying out by Australiaand New Zealand of responsibilities in the areas outside  the pacific.I should point out that in a covering letter d-ated18th February Mr. Dulles stresses the fact that he has no authorityto commit his Government to acceptance of the draft Treaty andthat in particular.the United States desires clearly to reserve the position of the Philippine Republic as a possible part.y toany such Treaty.    I am confident that after careful consideration the United Kingdom Government v/ill take the view that even if theUnited States insists that the Philippines should be a party tothe Treaty suoh inclusion will not be prejudicial to United kingdom or Allied interests in the Far East,With reference to paragraph 7 of -your letter I am ina position to inform you that the arguments contained thereinwere put to Mr. Dulles several times by Mr. Spender during the.discussions.    This was scarcely necessary as the same and other
arguments had apparently been put to Mr. Dulles in Tokyoby Sir A.L. Gascoigne with such force that in his opening .remarks&apos; Mr. Dulles made no single reference to the PacificPact of any description whether wide or limited.       Itwas only during subsequent discussion that at the instance ofthe representatives of Australia and New Zealand the arguments in favour of some arrangement under which Australia and New,Zealand could receive the benefit of United States assurance of their security were raised and exhaustively discussed.
APPENDIX   1CThe Chiefs of Staff have considered the draftAmerican/Aus trailan/New Zealand Treaty as set out in commonwealth relations Office telegram No.  105 from United Kingdom HighCommissioner in Australia and in the light of your lettercirculated as C.0,S.(51) 89.They have instructed me to send you their views asfollows:-1. The Chiefs of Staff do not wish to comment uponthe detailed wording of the Treaty which theyconsider should be a matter for experts.2. An American guarantee of Australian and NewZealand security is an undoubted strategic advantage,and this the proposed Treaty provides.    Inparticular, such a guarantee may be the only means by which Australia and New Zealand oould be persuaded to agree to a measure of Japanese rearmament whichthe Chiefs of Staff also consider to be desirable.The Chiefs of Staff would have preferred a straightforward American guarantee without reciprocal obli-gations on Australia and New Zealand and without a formal pact with its accompanying machinery.    they realise however that this could probably never havebeen achieved and in any case is out of the questionnow.The Chiefs of Staff regard the present proposal as the next best solution and generally acceptable,3. The Chiefs of Staff realise that there is inevitablysome danger that this Treaty may result in divertingAustralian and New Zealand interests from the defenceof the Middle East to that of the Pacific,    In thisconnection, however, they point out that:-(a) Such danger is inherent in any Treaty betweenthe Americans, Australians and New Zealanders,The present proposed draft does not seemto carry any more risks in this respect than any other which might be proposed.(b) A certain safeguard is inserted in that it is recognised that &quot;Australia and New Zealand as members of the British Commonwealth of nations have military obligations outside as well aswithin the Pacific area.&quot;(c) The fact that such a Treaty with its impliedAmerican guarantee had been concluded, mightease the task of the Australian and New Zealandpoliticians in obtaining agreement to thedespatch of Australian and New Zealand forces to the Middle East.The Chiefs of Staff consider it important that thefinal terms of the Treaty shall not contain any clausewhich will commit Australia or New Zealand in advance to deploy forces in the Pacific area.
T-he draft is open to &apos;the criticism that the UnitedKingdom is not a principal member of a Treaty dealing&apos;with an area in which we have major strategic interestsalthough we could no doubt be associated with it underthe. provisions of Article VIII, should we so desire.It should be possible to ensure that in war our point of view is adequately represented through theANZAM machinery.    In peace this might not be so easyand we should have to rely on the normal process of commonwealth consultation.The Chiefs of Staff think however that in the caseof a treaty such as this between three sovereignindependent states, it would be wrong to demand that we should be a member of the Council,particularly since this would imply that we were unwilling to leave our interests to be represented by Australia and New Zealand.The Chiefs of Staff would prefer that the membership of the Treaty should not be widened at all,and would be opposed to any interpretation of theprovisions of Article VIII&apos;which would lead to theTreaty becoming expanded into a pact embracing otherPacific Powers.If however there is any question of widening thescope of the Treaty to include other countries inthe Pacific area, then they consider that, in viewof our important interests in the region, we should ask to be included in the Council.
