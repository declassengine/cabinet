&apos;  &apos; &apos; &apos; /-    341 v(THIS DOCUME-NT- IS -THE PROPERTY OF PUS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S-GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(51) 686TH MARCH, 1951KOREARE-CROSSING OF 38TH PARALLEL,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs was invited by my colleagues (C.M.(51) 17th Conclusions,Minute 2) to instruct H.M..Ambassador in Washington to obtain a formalreply to the enquiry which he had addressed to the State Department inpursuance of the Cabinet&apos;s decision of 12th February regarding thecrossing of the 38th Parallel. (CM.(51) 13th Conclusions, Minute 1(3)).2. I had not by me at the meeting of the Cabinet a copy of washington telegram No. 538 of 20th February, the text of which is annexed, but i think that it is quite clear from the last paragraph ofthis telegram that the statement made by Mr. Dean Rusk of the state department represents the formal views of the United States Govern-ment.     This was not perhaps made entirely clear in C.P,(51) 65.In the circumstances I recommend that my colleagues should agreethat there is no need for the present to instruct H.M. Ambassador toobtain a further formal expression of the views of the United StatesGovernment.3. As I informed my colleagues at the meeting of the Cabinet on 5th March, a more detailed statement of United States views on thisquestion will be communicated to His Majesty&apos;s Government very shortly.    I shall report to my colleagues if this statement, when takenin conjunction with that made by Mr. Dean Rusk, appears to require any further representations being made to the United States Government.COPY NO.   31CABINETE.B.Foreign Office, S.W.1,6TH MARCH, 1951.
TEXT OF TELEGRAM NO. 538 OF 20TH FEBRUARY, 1951,FROM H.M. AMBASSADOR IN WASHINGTON TO FOREIGN OFFICEKorea.Following is a summary of views of United States government as given by Rusk at Ambassadors briefing on 16th February. -/&quot;Begins/There are possibly five general courses of action which theUnited Nations might adopt in Korea:1.      The United Nations might continue full military operations in korea in an effort to gain control of all of Korea and unify the country by force.     This course of action would require that the United Nationsmilitary effort be greatly reinforced.    Such reinforcements, however,are not now available, and even with such reinforcements, it is believedthat the enemy has both the apparent intention and sufficient force availableto prevent the United Nations from succeeding in such an effort.2.      The United Nations forces in Korea could be withdrawn, leaving the aggressor as the victor and admitting the failure of the United nations to repel the aggression.    If such a course of action were taken, the peopleof South Korea and their armed forces, which have fought valiantlyagainst the aggression, would be abandoned to a terrible fate.    the repercussions of such a retreat by the United Nations and this demonstra-tion of the weakness of its members would have a most serious effect upon the position of the free world.    It is the view of the United StatesGovernment, therefore, that a United Nations withdrawal from Korea wouldbe a grave mistake.3.     It is conceivable that an extension of hostilities to China mighthave the effect of liquidating the situation in Korea.    The United States,together with the other members of the United Nations, however, desire,if at all possible, to localise the area of conflict to Korea, and the unified Command is continuing to mate every effort to conform to thispolicy, despite extreme provocation.4.     An indefinite military stalemate at approximately the presentline might possibly be effected.    Such a stalemate, however, would impose a continued and serious drain upon United Nations military resources whichare badly needed for other missions.    Furthermore, such a stalematewould require the continuance of large-scale United Nations air attacks and naval action in order to prevent the massing of enemy forces whichmight drive the United Nations forces from Korea.    If such massive air attacks and naval action were continued, it is probable that the enemy wouldbe compelled to try all possible means to bring the Korean hostilities toa conclusion.    It is believed, however, that something approaching astalemate for at least a limited time is not improbable.5.      It is possible that, if there is a recognition that a completemilitary victory in Korea is impossible for either side, the prospect for negotiation and peaceful settlement would /grp. undec^7*        While therewould appear to be no present indication that the enemy is contemplating
; &apos; 343such a peaceful settlement, some form of modus vivendi, accompanied bya supervised cease-fire, might present a means for terminating the hostilities in Korea.     The Good Offices Committee presumably has inmind some such possibility.    Under the terms of the United nations charter and the Security Council resolutions of 1950 dealing with Korea,the United Nations and its member states are under obligation to render assistance to the R.O.K. in repelling aggression.    There is no obligation,however, on the United Nations or its members to commit sufficientforce to achieve the unification of Korea by military means, although had it been possible to bring about a restoration of peace and security in Koreaby defeating the aggressor, the political objectives of unification mightlikewise have been achieved.    The crossing of the 38th Parallel, there-fore, should now be regarded as a question which relates to the mission of the United Nations in assisting the R.O.K. to repel the aggression.The forces of the United Nations are now disposed in a basically defensiveposition.    It is however an aggressive defence, and as such will continueto safeguard the forces of the United Nations by restricting the fullinitiative of the enemy and by upsetting his plan of attack    This shouldbe viewed as a war of manoeuvre and not of capturing or holding terrainas such.     It is vitally important that the enemy not be given any indica-tions as to United Nations intentions, for if he were assured of aninviolable sanctuary in North Korea similar to that which now exists for him in Manchuria, the safety of the United Nations forces would be seriouslyjeopardised.     It is believed, essential, therefore, that the Unified Commandshould continue to have complete authority for air action throughout Koreawhenever the situation demands it;  the same would apply to United NationsNaval action.     Furthermore, the Unified Command must retain freedomof action to conduct such raids, thrusts, and patrol actions as might berequired by an aggressive defence;  the Government of the United Statessees no political objection to operations of this kind across the 38thParallel.     The continuing necessity for the conduct of military operationsacross the 38th Parallel should not, however, be confused with the politicalquestion of whether the United Nations should seek to unify all of Korea by force.     The United States Government does not now have in mind the con-duct of major operations on the part of presently available United nations forces in order to seize the territory of North Korea, and at present amassive movement of such forces into North Korea is not probable.There will be time to consider the question of a major crossing of the 38thParallel when this becomes a more immediate problem, and the UnitedStates Government at the appropriate time will of course consult with theother members of the United Nations participating in military operations in Korea.    A decision on this question at the present time, however, isconsidered premature since we do not know what the enemy&apos;s attitude or military situation will be at that time nor what other factors may ultimatelyrequire consideration in relation to such a decision.    Therefore, notwith-standing the fact that the authority of the Unified Command under the united nations resolutions to conduct military operations north of the 3 8th Parallelis clear, and although that Command has, of course, the responsibility tocarry out the United Nations mission in Korea and to assure the safety ofthe forces entrusted to its command, the United States Government willprovide every opportunity for such consultations and will make every effort to achieve as much agreement as possible./^Ends7This was followed by a general discussion among the united nations representatives which revealed wide agreement with it and Ruskwas asked to reduce it to writing.    He has taken until today to obtainapproval for it but it is now a formal statement of the United states attitude.
