MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES
I circulate for the consideration of my colleagues the memorandum at Annex
)13 the future scale of operations of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey, for
.,rttich I am responsible.
2. The Cabinet last considered policy in the Falkland Islands Dependencies
:luring the Antarctic summer season of 1947-48, on the basis of a comprehensive
memorandum submitted jointly by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the
,etzetary of State for Commonwealth Relations, and my predecessor (C.P. (47) 263).
t he Cabinet conclusions (C.M. (47) 77th Conclusions, Minute 3 and C.M. (48) 2nd
onclusions, Minute 1) are quoted in the first two paragraphs of the Annex to this
piper.
3. The Cabinet decided that the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey should
.1‘ntinue to occupy bases in the United Kingdom Sector of the Antarctic, but did,
not lay down specifically how many or where they should be. At that time, however,
the number was relatively large (seven bases). Experience has shown that it is
desirable to define the commitment more closely, to facilitate planning and
administration; and, for reasons which are fully described in the Annex, my predecessor,
shortly before he left office, came to the conclusion (which I share) that
the number of bases should be reduced to a minimum of four. The Foreign Office
and other interested Departments were consulted but felt that this reduction in the
,,cale of our activities should not be undertaken without a further reference to the
Cabinet; and the Foreign Office take the view, I understand, that a large number
of bases is desirable.
4. To resolve these points it is necessary to examine how the number of bases
occupied is likely to affect our legal title and practical position in the Antarctic
Dependencies; to assess how important it is to maintain our title and position for
.strategic, economic and prestige reasons; and to balance against this the practical
and financial implications of increasing the scale of our activity in the Antarctic
above that recommended in this paper. These matters are covered in detail in the
Annex.
5. I invite my colleagues to agree that a directive should be issued to the
ernor of the Falkland Islands in the terms proposed in the last paragraph of
the Annex, providing for the maintenance of a minimum of four bases. This would
involve some weakening of our position in Graham Land (the mainland part of the
area). On the evidence before me, however, I cannot feel that a greater scale of
activity, which would necessitate considerable financial and other assistance from
the United Kingdom, would at present be justified. I reached this conclusion
some months ago when the Annex to this paper was first prepared. Despite some
reported increase in Chilean activity locally since then, subsequent developments
39416
2
in the international situation generally have strengthened my view that it would be
unjustifiable at this time for us to divert further resources to the Antarctic.
6. There is a further point. It will be seen from the Annex that, in 1948, the
Cabinet also decided that force should not be used to expel foreign parties from
British territory in the Antarctic. Since during the last session of Parliam
attention was drawn to the presence of an Argentine party at Deception Island, is
think it would be useful if my colleagues could indicate whether they agree 1
the previous Cabinet decision about the use of force should continue to hold

ANNEX
SCALE OF OPERATIONS OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS
DEPENDENCIES SURVEY
Purpose of this paper
Policy in the Falkland Islands Dependencies was last considered by the
Cabinet during the Antarctic summer season of 1947-48, in the light of Argentine
and Chilean encroachments which were then taking place. A comprehensive
memorandum (C.P. (47) 263) was circulated in September 1947, jointly by the
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Secretary of State for Commonwealth
Relations, and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, analysing the legal, strategic
and political considerations affecting the attitude and future policy of His
Majesty's Government. As a result of this examination the Cabinet (C.M. (47)
77th Conclusions, Minute 3) decided : —
(a) that His Majesty's Government should continue to maintain their title
to the Falkland Islands Dependencies, making protests to the Governments
of the Argentine and Chile in regard to their encroachments,
but making it clear that His Majesty's Government would accept the
judgment of the International Court of Justice on the question of title
to the disputed areas;
(b) that the policy of maintaining British posts in the Dependencies should
he continued. This policy had been started in the latter part of the
war and is carried out by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey.
2. During the 1947-48 season United Kingdom naval forces were sent to
the area to maintain prestige, but the idea of using these or other forces to expel
the foreign intruders by force was rejected by the Cabinet on 8th January, 1948
sC.M. (48) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 1).
3. The purpose of the present paper is to assess the scale of future operations
of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey appropriate in the light of practical
experience on the spot since 1947 and of current requirements for political,
strategic, and other purposes.
Past and present scale of our occupation
4. The Survey began in the Antarctic season, 1943-44. It was organised and
supplied initially by the Admiralty; for two seasons after the war this responsibility
was transferred to the Colonial Office; since 1948 it has rested with the Governor of
the Falkland Islands, who is of course responsible to the Secretary of State for the
Colonies.
5. The bases occupied by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey at
di4rent times are shown on the attached map. They are known by distinguishing
etters and are (reading from north-east to south-west) : —
South Orkney Islands—
Laurie Island (C).
Signy Island (H.).
South Shetland Islands—
Admiralty Bay (G).
Deception Island (B).
Graham Land and adjacent islands--
Hope Bay (D) (mainland sledging base).
Port Lockroy (A).
Argentine Islands (F).
Marguerite Bay (E) (mainland sledging base).
6. In the season 1943-44 two bases were occupied (A and. B). In 1944-45 a
third was opened (D). In 1945-46 the total was five, bases C and E being added.
In 1946-47 the total was raised to six by the addition of base F, and base C was
transferred to a neighbouring site at base H. In 1947-48, the period of intensified
39416 B 2
Argentine and Chilean activity, the total was raised to seven by the addition of
base G. In 1948-49 base D was partly destroyed by fire and was evacuated,
reducing the total to six. Plans to establish two new bases during that season, one
near the north tip of Graham Land to replace base D and another on Alexander
Land in the south, liad to he abandoned owing to adverse weather. In 1949-50
it was decided to evacuate base E, which had been cut off by adverse weather
during the previous season. This difficult operation was successfully carried out
in February 1950 and the total number of bases at present occupied is therefore five;
that is to say base H in the South Orkney Islands, bases B and G in the South
Shetland Islands, and bases A and F on islands adjacent to Graham Land ; there
being at present no " sledging base " actually on the mainland from which long
over-land journeys can be undertaken. The approved programme for the current
season 1950-51 provides for maintaining the bases mentioned immediately above
with the exception of base A, which is adjacent to base F and of little independent
value as a meteorological station; after the reliefs are complete the total will
therefore be four.
Scale of foreign occupation
7. The Argentine Government maintain three permanently-occupied bases in
our Sector, at Laurie Island in the South Orkneys, Deception Island in the South
Shetlands, and Gamma Island off the west coast of Graham Land. Recently the
Argentine has set up two further posts (one on the west coast of Graham Land
and one in the South Shetlands), one of which is an automatic recording meteorological
station. A recent report from an Argentine source claims the establishment
of another post, algo on the west coast of Graham Land. None of these last
three posts is at present occupied, though it is to be noted that Denmark used
evidence of activity of this kind to strengthen her case for sovereignty over East
Greenland when it came before the International Court at The Hague in 1933.
The Chilean Government have for several years maintained two bases in our Sector,
at Greenwich Island in the South Shetlands and Cape Legoupil on the northern
tip of Graham Land. In January 1951 they claimed the establishment of a third
base, on the north-west coast of Graham Land. As already recorded, Argentine
and Chilean competition since the war grew to a climax in the season 1947-48,
when there were also large naval demonstrations; since then neither Government
has abated its claim to sovereignty or has become less unwilling to test that
claim in the International Court.
Abortive Attempt at an Internat4nal Settlement
8. In 1948 the United States proposed the establishment of an international
regime in Antarctica. His Majesty's Government publicly announced their agreement
to this in principle as a basis for discussion. Owing to the opposition of other
interested Governments the proposal was dropped and there is no immediate likelihood
of an international agreement for Antarctica. Unless and until some
acceptable arrangement of this kind becomes possible, it is important that our
claims to sovereignty should be maintained.
Purpose of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey—the Legal Position
9. The purpose of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey, and all it can
achieve in a political sense, is to maintain our effective practical position in the
Dependencies by means short of force, i.e., by physical occupation and " administration,"
and thus to sustain our legal title.

Factors bearing on the scale of activity desirable
13. Although there. is no immediate prospect of a case c,Inning before the
International Court, the possibility must be borne in mind. 1.,.'-gal considerations
alone would indicate playing for safety and maintaining a large number of bases.
Some limitation is, however, imposed by considerations both of finance and of what
experience on the spot has shown to be practicable in khis remote and inhospitable
area. It is, therefore, desirable to ex3rninf:, -ocn .7 detail the value of the
Dependencies in the Antarctic and the c::f.c.Ti L is in fact worth while
to maintain our title to them and to assert =cal occupation • there.
Value of the Antarctic Dependencies
14. • The value of the Antarctic Dependf.-ocics can conveniently be considered
under the three headings of strategic value, ettoriOnlic val,ue and prestige.
Strategic: Value
15. The Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey was started during the war to
deny naval facilities in this area to the enemy, by reinforcing our own position
there. At the time of the 1947-1948 Cabinet discussions the Chiefs of Staff gave
their opinion that our only firm strategic requirement in the Dependencies was to
retain control of such part of them as was essential for controlling the Drake
Passage (the wide strait between South America and Antarctica) and for denying
bases to an enemy in the seas around this region. The territory necessary for this
purpose was defined as South Georgia plus a proportion of the usable islands in
the South Shetland and South Orkney groups, but the Chiefs of Staff considered
it " most desirable " for us to retain possession of the remainder of the Dependencies
as well. It appears that subsequent experience has caused the strategic
importance of the Dependencies to be rated still less highly. In April 1948, in
response to a request by the Foreign Secretary, the Chiefs of Staff (C.O.S. (48)
53rd Meeting, Item 4) reviewed possible military measures which might be taken
in the following season to secure our interests in the Dependencies in view of
continuing foreign encroachments. They concluded that the only military action
justified would be a prolonged visit, for " demonstration " purposes only, by a
frigate, and a shorter visit by a cruiser (the latter did not, in fact, take place). In
the report by the Joint Planning Staff (J.P. (48) 26), approved at the time by the
Chiefs of Staff, it was stated that, " in view of the low strategic value of the area
(i.e., the Dependencies). we recommend that no expense of (Services) men, money
or material should now be incurred " except for the small naval demonstration
mentioned above. In July 1950 a further review of strategic requirements in the
Dependencies was made by the Joint Planning Staff (C.O.S. (50) 243) and approved
by the Chiefs of Staff (C.O.S. (50) 90th Meeting, Item 3). The conclusion was that
recent experience had shown that it was impracticable to operate unstrengthened
naval vessels in the waters in the vicinity of the South Orkneys, South Shetlands
and Graham Land; and that these territories therefore have little strategic importance.
In making this review however, the Chiefs of Staff also took the view that it
would be desirable to continue to maintain meteorological stations in the Dependencies
and to retain mining rights in case discovery and economic development
were to become practicable in the future. On this point see the following
paragraph.
Economic Value
16. The only proved economic value of the Antarctic lies in whaling and
sealing, which do not necessitate sovereignty over the land areas. On the land,
geological and associated investigations have now been going on for some seasons
but no commercially exploitable minerals have been discovered, and there is no
present indication that valuable minerals are likely to be found. The prevalence
of snow and ice, the inaccessibility of the area, and the very severe living cGri:';i1;i311S
would in any case appear to place formidable obstacles in the way of an
development on these lines. Scientific investigation and research, such 1:1-o, -
always been one feature of the Survey, are of course of intrinsic value; but. l in
in mind the primary purposes of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey, this
factor could not in itself justify maintaining, from local resources, bases at point-;
where they are not essential for political or strategic reasons or where they present
serious practical difficulties.
Prestige
17. The Antarctic Dependencies are totally uninhabited, except of course for
the Survey bases which are artificially established there. Apart from watching
the interests of the occasional whaling vessel operating from South Georgia (and of
a British whaling station at Deception Island if, as is possible, one is re-established
there), there is no question of having to protect British subjects. To that extent
it is possible to distinguish the Antarctic Dependencies from British territories in
other parts of the world to which foreign countries lay claim; although it is also
necessary to remember that too great an apparent passivity in the face of Argentine
and Chilean competition in the Antarctic Dependencies might give some encouragement
to the prosecution of such claims elsewhere, particularly. by Latin-American
Governments. This aspect of the matter has at times attracted some attention
in Parliament. The Commonwealth Relations Office are, furthermore, understood
to take the view that a reduction in Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey activity,
if made at the cost of some weakening of our title, would have a discouraging effect
on Australia and New Zealand whom we have been urging to greater activity in
their own Sectors of the Antarctic. The Foreign Office are understood to attach
considerable importance to the maintenance of BritiSh prestige in the Argentine and
Chile by a sufficient display of activity in the Antarctic; and to take the view that
27 7,
we shall lose prestige both in South America and generally if, while claiming
Antarctic areas for our territory, we not only permit other countries to establish
tJases b spite of our protests but also diminish our own activities in the face of
ompetition for, actual physical occupation. As against this it must be borne in
H nd that the decision has already been taken not to expel the Argentine and
:1iilean intruders from the Dependencies by force (see paragraph 2). Naval
i.":1M3nstrations are another way of maintaining prestige; but, after the experience
' 1947-48, naval demonstrations have been found to present practical difficulties,
Tice January 1949 a mutual self-denying ordinance has been in operation, by
teat between ourselves and the Argentine and Chilean Governments, by
all parties have publicly undertaken to refrain from sending naval vessels
th of latitude 60° apart from "routine visits." The maintenance of prestige
thus devolves on the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey alone. While the
number of Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey bases maintained is no doubt
relevant, it is a matter of degree to be measured against the importance of the
object in view and the cost of achieving it. So long as the Survey exists and maintain
:I at least four bases, which is what is proposed later in this paper, there are
grounds for hoping that our prestige in relation to the Antarctic Dependencies will
not be seriously affected.
Practical Considerations
18. There is by now considerable experience of what it costs in resources,
effort and risk to maintain and relieve bases in the Antarctic. The latest demonstra-
(-)n of this has been the hazardous and expensive operation which was necessary
season to relieve the party on the mainland at Base E. Since then there has
careful and detailed consultation with the Governor of the Falkland Islands,
has been personally in charge of operations for the last two-and-a-half years.
de takes the view that four bases, preferably excluding mainland bases, is the most
which can be regularly maintained in existing conditions and with existing
resources. The reasons which have led to this conclusion, and the implications of
bringing the scale of activity back to six bases (or more) including two bases on the
mainland, as desired by the Foreign Office, are examined in detail below.
Logistics
19. The Antarctic summer season, during which all bases must be relieved
and reprovisioned, lasts no more than three-and-a-half to four months. Distances
are very great; Marguerite Bay (Base E), the remotest base hitherto maintained,
lies about 1,500 miles from the Falkland Islands. By far the greater part of the
personnel and stores must first be shipped from the United Kingdom to the Falkland
Islands, another 8,000 miles (as contrasted with the fact that the Argentine
and Chile can provision their posts direct from the Metropolitan country). Within
the short Antarctic summer the relief ship's itinerary is necessarily governed by the
movement and behaviour of pack-ice which is unpredictable and has in some
seasons hindered relief operations to the point of danger. The ship also has to put
back to the Falkland Islands during the season to refuel. Last season the ship had
already covered 9,000 miles (exclusive of the voyage out from the United Kingdom)
by late March and the essential relief programme had still not been completed.
The Survey only possesses one ship of its own (the m.v. John Biscoe) and there is
no vessel within reach to go to her assistance if she got into difficulties. For these
reasons it would not be prudent to commit the John Biscoe to maintaining more
than four bases in future.
20. Additional bases, especially if they included sledging bases at inaccessible
points on the mainland like Base E, could only be undertaken if a second ship could
be made available. Only ships of special construction, or specially adapted ships,
can operate safely and reliably in Antarctic waters. No such ship is available in the
Falkland Islands, nor are there officers and men for a crew. Ship and crew could
probably only be obtained after a prolonged delay and at considerable expense. A
theoretical alternative would be to place a naval vessel at the Governor's disposal
for the whole of each Antarctic summer. Such naval assistance was in fact available
in the peak season 1947-48 when seven bases were previously maintained; but
for reasons explained earlier in this paper His Majesty's Ships no longer visit these
waters.
21. If Base E, or a similar mainland base or bases, were reoccupied it would
be essential to have permanently at hand the means of air relief which had to be
8 • brought in specially during the last season, in case relief by sea is impossible. The
Survey now possesses the necessary two aircraft, but replacements would have to
be provided for in case of damage or loss. Pilots and ground-staff would have
to be found from the Royal Air Force or the Royal Canadian Air Force. It would
be essential to repeat the arrangement made in the past season to divert an
Admiralty tanker to Deception Island to carry aviation spirit and lubricants. None
of this would be needed if the scale of operations were limited to four bases without
a mainland sledging base.
22. Expeditions involving the relief of remote bases are difficult and dangerous
and demand not only the general planning and direction but the presence on the
spot at critical moments of an officer of seniority and experience to co-ordinate sea.
air and land operations and to take the responsibility for vital decisions. The
present Governor of the Falkland Islands, Sir Miles Clifford, has hitherto under..
taken this responsibility himself. It has, however, necessitated his absence from the
Colony for weeks on end each Antarctic summer, besides the calls on his time
during the rest of the year. In the interests of the Colony itself some limit must
be put to the calls on the Governor's time. If the Governor were absent Or
incapacitated, there would be no one of sufficient standing and experience availab
on the spot.
23. If it were decided to operate the Falkland Islands Dependencies Surv.
on a scale appreciably above that recommended in this paper it would probably be
found unavoidable to strengthen the administrative organisation both locally ar ci
in London, with consequent calls on Civil Service man-power.
Finance
24. During the war and until the end of the financial year 1945-46 the
Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey was borne on the Admiralty Vote. From
1st April, 1946, when responsibility was transferred to the Colonial Office, up to the
end of last season (the Antarctic financial year ends on 30th June), the total capital
and recurrent cost of the Survey has been, in round figures, £550,000. In the first
two years the cost was shared between United Kingdom and local Dependencies'
Funds, but since 1st April, 1948, the entire cost has been borne by local funds. Over
the whole period only about £60,000 was a final charge on United Kingdom funds
and the balance (about £490,000) has been borne by the Dependencies. Expenditure
has therefore averaged nearly £140,000 a year.
25. The revenue of the Dependencies is derived from South Georgia, the only
inhabited territory, and arises very largely from export tax on whale and seal oil.
This industry has been passing through a temporary boom since the war owing to
the world shortage of oils and fats, but prices are already falling and must be
expected to fall further. Revenue reached an abnormal peak of £140,000 last year,
but is likely to contract to a figure substantially less than £100,000 per annum. Out
of the total Dependencies' revenue there must first be met the essential needs ,r)i.
South Georgia itself, which are at present about £20,000 a year without allowi
for the improvement of services there. It must therefore be assumed that henceforiii
£80,000 a year or less is all that will be available to spend on the Falkland Islands
Dependencies Survey. Even so, this would mean that a high proportion of the
revenue drawn from South Georgia tax-payers (i.e., the whaling companies) would
be spent, as now, on purposes which afford them practically no direct service or
benefit, save for a meteorological service, and which are fundamentally an Imperial
commitment. In addition, the Dependencies possess certain financial reserves,
which do not, however, now total more than £100,000.
26. The cost of Antarctic operations is difficult to estimate, and it is impossible
to foresee all the contingencies; estimates are usually exceeded in practice. The
Governor calculates that four bases and no more can be maintained within a total
Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey budget of £80,000 per annum (this figure
includes of course not only the running cost of the bases themselves but the capital
• and recurrent expenditure on relieving them). The approved Dependencies' Budget
for the current financial year estimates expenditure at £103,000, of which £83,000 is
for the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey at the scale of four bases, nearly
half of it going on the recurrent costs of the ship. At this rate, available revenue
should therefore just cover expenditure, and any excesses could probably be met
for some time to come from reserves without exhausting the latter.
•
9 279
27. The cost of increasing the number of bases to six or seven, including two
mainland sledging bases, would include the staffing and running of the additional
b6ses themselves, and the necessary additional sea and air operations described
above, namely, the construction or purchase and maintenance of a second ship
uniess a naval vessel were provided free by the Admiralty), the maintenance,
;-'..nning and, in due course, replacement of aircraft, and the delivery of fuel and oil;
unforeseen emergency expenditure (e.g., hire of an icebreaker from North America)
might also prove necessary. These items would be very costly. Detailed estimates
cannot be made at this stage; but the total additional annual charges might well be
of the order of another £100,000 a year (£30,000 of which would be for the bases
themselves), and it would be unwise to reckon on any lesser figure for the initial
capital expenditure.
28. It will be seen that to maintain the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey
on the scale of six or seven bases, including two mainland bases, would be quite
beyond local financial resources and that these might well be exhausted within
tae first year. There would then be no alternative to calling on a direct and possibly
1:lite large (and recurring) grant from United Kingdom funds, over and above the
.c.cts which the Admiralty would incur if a naval vessel were sent.
Ricks of the operation
29. In the first few seasons after the war the weather was favourable and the
Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey experienced a run of good luck. This was
broken at the end of 1948 when three men of the base parties lost their lives in
accidents and when ice made the relief of Base D a hazardous operation and
completely prevented the relief of Base E. The special relief expedition to Base E
in the 1949-50 season was fortunately successful but success could not be counted on
another time. It may be said that these are normal risks of Antarctic exploration
and that the men are volunteers. Nevertheless, the Survey is a Governmental
operation and it seems doubtful how far Parliament would accept it as justifiable
to perpetuate, for political and prestige reasons and for the sake of uninhabited
territory, operations which may at any time lead to loss of life.
,iing
30. It will be apparent that an expansion on the scale under discussion
could not in any event take place without a considerable period of preparation. An
additional ship, and crews for both her and the aircraft, would have to be found;
staff and stores for the bases would have to be programmed, acquired, and shipped
out from the United Kingdom; reconnaissance (possibly only in summer) would be
needed for new base sites; the administrative organisation would have to be
reviewed; and detailed consultation would have to take place with the Treasury
about financial implications. Such an expansion could not, of course, take place
before next season (1951-52) at the earliest, and might take longer. It is on this
understanding, and without prejudice to the question of future policy, that a limited
programme of four bases was approved for the forthcoming season 1950-51 as
recorded in paragraph 6 of this paper.
elusions and recommendations
31. While His Majesty's Government cannot abandon the Antarctic
' 3ndencies altogether and must keep alive their legal claim, at least to the more
)rtant parts, against the eventuality that the matter may come to the Inter -
.)nal Court, the conclusion suggested by the above review is that is not for the
,tnt essential or desirable to assert ourselves so actively on the spot as seemed
'ssary when the Cabinet last considered the matter in 1947-48. The value of the
,endencies does not, it is suggested, justify at present the diversion of resources
essary to maintain six or seven bases, including one or more sledging bases on the
illand. In financial terms alone, such a scale of activity would soon necessitate
rag on a subvention from the United Kingdom, which the results to be, gained
old not appear to justify in present circumstances. Moreover, financial assistance
ne would not solve the problem; the practical difficulties would still remain.
,e-se difficulties could be avoided by maintaining our occupation unchanged in the
_tatively accessible South Orkney and South Shetland groups, coupled with a
partial, though not complete, withdrawal from Graham Land. Whatever value
39416
10
the Antarctic Dependencies in general may have, the mainland of Graham Land
appears to fall to the bottom of the scale of priorities, while its occupation by the
Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey presents the maximum expense, difficulty
and risk.
32. It is therefore suggested that for the present the interests of His Majesty's
Government in the Antarctic Dependencies could be adequately maintained by
issuing a directive to the Governor in the following terms :—
(a) The number of bases occupied should not fall below four. Of these, on,s
should be maintained at Signy Island (South Orkney group); one
Deception Island (South Shetland group); one at a suitable place on
Graham Land or its adjacent islands, to be chosen from year to year
and the fourth to be located anywhere in the Dependencies, but prF
ferably to a second base in the South Shetland group in order
maintain numerical superiority in that group over both the Argent",
and Chile, who have one permanent base there each.
(b) All four bases may be " static " bases, there being no obligation to maintain
a mainland sledging base and carry out long distance journeys.
The formula would permit of a mainland base being re-established.
should that prove practicable within local resources, but it would not
be compulsory for such bases always to be maintained.
The Governor would (as at present) submit annual programmes to the Secretary
of State for the Colonies, who would henceforth be in a position to approve them
without further reference to other Departments, provided they fulfilled the above
minimum conditions. There would, of course, be nothing to preclude an increased
scale of activity being approved should that at any time appear practicable. These
arrangements would hold good until and unless some major change in the international
or strategic circumstances made a further review by Ministers desirable.
