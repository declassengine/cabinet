THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENT      ^Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1951 &quot; * f*SECRET Co^y No.   g \CP. (51) 7320th March, 1951CABINETSTATUS OF THE FORCES OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATYORGANISATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsAnnexed for approval by my colleagues is a draft multilateral Agreementgoverning the status of forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Powers on NATO,duty in each other&apos;s territory. The draft was prepared by a 12-Power working party, on which His Majesty&apos;s Government were represented, and has now beensubmitted by the North Atlantic Deputies to their respective Governments forapproval or comment by 31st March. I therefore seek the authority of mycolleagues for acceptance of the draft, subject to certain amendments suggested inthis memorandum and to any other drafting or other minor amendements that maybe necessary, by the United Kingdom Deputy on the North Atlantic Council onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. The draft is based largely on a similar Agreement signed by the brussels treaty Powers on 21st December, 1949 (Cmd. 7868), but not yet ratified by any party. If the present N.A.T.O. draft is accepted by all the Governments concerned,it will supersede the Brussels Treaty Agreement (since the Brussels Treaty powers will all be parties to the new one) and ratification of the earlier Agreement neednot be pursued. If this is agreed, I propose to suggest to the other Brussels powers that we should agree to abandon ratification of the latter.3. In general, the terms of the draft appear to be reasonably satisfactory tous, and the Departments concerned in preparing it are satisfied that, having regardto the interests of reciprocity, it should be accepted. Certain drafting amendments,designed to clarify the text, have been suggested interdepartmentally since it was submitted to the Deputies, and can be put forward by the United Kingdom Deputyin signifying His Majesty&apos;s Government^ approval in principle of the agreement as a whole. Some of the Articles need no comment, and I propose in this memo-randum to deal only with those Articles which depart from the text of the brussels treaty Agreement, or raise considerations of special importance to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. The chief of these is Article VII concerning criminal jurisdiction,on which I have thought it desirable to comment at some length.Article I4. The Brussels Treaty Agreement covered only uniformed personnel of the armed Forces. The present draft has been widened, at the instance of the UnitedStates, so as to bring &quot;two limited classes of civilians within the scope of certain ofthe articles.Article III , n   )5. Under this Article, exemption from passport, visa and aliens regulationsis conferred only on properly identified military personnel of the Armed Forces.The danger is thus excluded of an influx into this country, in times of emergency,of unauthorised civilians claiming exemption from immigration control under theAgreement.40325 B
Article VIP6. (i) The United States authorities at present exercise exclusive criminal jurisdiction over their forces in this country, under the terms of the United Statesof America (Visiting Forces) Act, 1942, and two subordinate instruments, particulars of which were given in CP. (50) 42 of 30th March, 1950.(ii) The Cabinet, at their meeting on 27th April, 1950 (CM. (50) 26th Con-clusions, Minute 5), after considering the effect of the Article about criminal juris-diction in the agreement between the Brussels Treaty Powers on the status ofvisiting forces, gave authority for negotiations to be begun with the United StatesGovernment with a view to securing their agreement to a modification of thepresent arrangements. It was contemplated that, if these negotiations succeeded,legislation might then be introduced repealing the Act of 1942, and conferring onvisiting forces from the United States, the Commonwealth countries, and anyother country to which the new Act was applied, criminal jurisdiction concurrentwith that of the United Kingdom courts, on the understanding that in practice amember of a visiting force would not normally be prosecuted before our courts for an offence which was of a domestic character or principally affected military discipline.(iii) These negotiations were begun, but the United States Government hadnot revealed their reactions to our proposals by the time arrangements were madefor the multilateral discussions now in progress, and no further progress can nowbe expected with the bilateral negotiations.(iv) At the beginning of these new discussions, the United States representativeclaimed that under International Law the authorities of a force visiting a foreign country with the consent of the Government of that country were, in the absenceof special agreements, entitled to exercise full and exclusive jurisdiction in respectof offences committed by members of the visiting force. This view was not accepted by the United Kingdom representatives; but the matter was not pursuedas in discussion it appeared that the United States representative was authorisedto accept, for peace-time, a &quot; special agreement &quot; between the North Atlantic treaty powers based on the doctrine of concurrent jurisdiction-provided that arrange-ments were made to ensure that in practice the authorities of the visiting forceretained the first claim to deal with certain specified types of case of particularconcern to them. Article VII of the attached draft agreement (which is based on,but departs in some respects from, the draft of this Article first tabled by theUnited States representative) provides that: -(a) The authorities of the visiting force should have exclusive jurisdiction inrespect of offences committed by members of that force relating to thesecurity of the sending State but not to that of the receiving State, andany other offences contrary to the law of the sending State but not tothat of the receiving State.(b) In respect of offences which are contrary both to the law of the receivingState and to the military law of the sending State, the authorities ofthe visiting force and the Courts of the receiving State should exercisejurisdiction concurrently; and with certain exceptions the Courts ofthe receiving State should have the primary right to exercise jurisdiction.The exceptional cases, in which the authorities of the visiting force wouldhave the primary right to exercise jurisdiction, are:  (i) offences solely against the property or security of the sending state or against the person or property of a fellow member of the force or his wife or child; and(ii) offences arising out of any act done in the performance of officialduty or pursuant to a lawful order by a competent authority.It is thought that the United States Government will insist thatthe words in square brackets form part of the Agreement. Infact, the words add little to the sense of this paragraph. .If, but only if, the authorities with the primary right of jurisdictionexercise that right to the point where the individual is either convictedor acquitted, then the other authorities may not try the individual inthe same territory for the same offence.* The paragraphs dealing with Article VII have been prepared in consultation with the LordChancellor, the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland, and other interested Ministers.

Article VII of the attached draft agreement (which is based on,but departs in some respects from, the draft of this Article first tabled by theUnited States representative) provides that: -(a) The authorities of the visiting force should have exclusive jurisdiction inrespect of offences committed by members of that force relating to thesecurity of the sending State but not to that of the receiving State, andany other offences contrary to the law of the sending State but not tothat of the receiving State.(b) In respect of offences which are contrary both to the law of the receivingState and to the military law of the sending State, the authorities ofthe visiting force and the Courts of the receiving State should exercisejurisdiction concurrently; and with certain exceptions the Courts ofthe receiving State should have the primary right to exercise jurisdiction.The exceptional cases, in which the authorities of the visiting force wouldhave the primary right to exercise jurisdiction, are:  (i) offences solely against the property or security of the sending state or against the person or property of a fellow member of the force or his wife or child; and(ii) offences arising out of any act done in the performance of officialduty or pursuant to a lawful order by a competent authority.It is thought that the United States Government will insist thatthe words in square brackets form part of the Agreement.

(v) It was clear that the United States representative would make no further concessions, and also that the representatives of the other countries would notpersist in maintaining objection in principle to the proposals, although someexpressed doubts as to the definition of the categories of offence in which the sending State could exercise the primary right of jurisdiction. The United kingdom delegation made it clear that their instructions did not permit them to commit HisMajesty&apos;s Government to these proposals and reserved their position. A decision is therefore required before Governmental comments are due on 31st March on thequestion whether these proposals about criminal jurisdiction can be accepted byHis Majesty&apos;s Government, subject to the reservation that they could only be putinto effect if and when the necessary legislation had been passed.(vi) It seems to us that no difficulty arises as regards the proposals in para-graph 4 (a) above. As regards the proposals in paragraph 4 (b) above, however,there are a number of conflicting considerations.  On the one hand-fa) These proposals would involve legislation.   Since such legislation wouldhave the effect of ousting the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom courts in those cases where the authorities of the visiting force exercised their primary right of jurisdiction, it might well be controversial.(b) The particular provision referred to in paragraph 4 (b) (ii) above goes ratherwide. For instance, if an American soldier driving a car down Piccadillyin the execution of his duty knocked down an English civilian, or ifan American sentry, when on duty, shot a civilian, the offender couldnot be dealt with in our Courts if the United States authorities decidedto try him by court-martial.On the other hand (c) The agreement does not in terms require us to confer exclusive jurisdictionon a visiting force, except in the strictly limited field described in para-graph (iv) (a) above, but is concerned with the procedure for thepractical exercise of concurrent jurisdiction. To that extent it seems less objectionable politically; and the proposals, even though they involvegiving the visiting force a primary right of jurisdiction in specifiedclasses, of cases, undoubtedly represent a considerable whittling down of the privilege of exclusive jurisdiction over the whole field whichthe Americans at present enjoy and to which they claim that they areentitled by their own domestic law and by international law.(d) There is small prospect of our persuading the Americans to concede any-thing more, and unless we accept this proposal there is some risk that no agreement will be arrived at- No other country, as far as can be seen,wishes to take a strong stand on this Article. It is understood that theUnited States Government is proposing to use the provisions aboutjurisdiction in this agreement as a model for their forces elsewhere, andwill wish, for instance, to make a similar arrangement in respect of theleased Bases. They contemplate also that these arrangements would necessarily replace their existing arrangements with the Canadian^ Government in respect of United States forces in Canada.(e) There is the very important consideration that we are much concerned as to the arrangements for our own troops abroad, and we have there-fore to look at the agreement in our capacity as a sending State as wellas in that of a receiving State. In the past we have claimed for our forces abroad what amounts to complete immunity from foreign juris-dictions. This not only makes it more difficult for us to resist the more restricted claims embodied in the present proposals, but raises the doubt whether in our own interests it is even desirable that we should resistthese claims.(vii) The Ministers I have consulted are agreed that on a balance of thoseconsiderations it would be right to accept the substance of the provisions set out inArticle VII. The Lord Chancellor, however, reserves the right to draw attentionto a possible conflict between this Agreement and the Council of Europe convention on Human Pdghts and Fundamental Freedoms to which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentis a party. The difficulty, briefly, is whether it is consistent with the convention that a group of persons resident in the territory of the United Kingdom should be excluded from the jurisdiction of its courts, to which on one view access is guaranteed by the Convention.40325        * B 2
(viii) If this is agreed, it would follow that the necessary legislation should beprepared. In addition to providing for the exercise of a primary right of jurisdic-tion by the authorities of the visiting force in the particular cases specified in theagreement and also of exclusive jurisdiction in the appropriate cases, it is suggestedthat the legislation should also cover the various points which were referred to inparagraph 4 (d) of CP. (50) 42, in particular the following: -(a) Provision would be included, on the lines of the relevant Defence Regula-tion applying to the United States forces, ousting the jurisdiction of thecoroner in those cases reserved to the jurisdiction of the visiting force.(b) Provision would be made, on the lines of a Defence Regulation in force during the war, making it possible for a member of a foreign visitingforce who was arrested without warrant to be detained in custody forlonger than the period allowed by the ordinary law so as to give timefor him to be handed over to an escort from the visiting forceconcerned.(c) Provision would be made that the Bill could be applied to any country byOrder in Council, one of the considerations to be taken into accountbeing whether that country was prepared to grant reciprocity, as the signatories of this agreement (including the United States of America)would be.(d) The Act of 1942, and also the Allied Forces Act, 1940, would be repealed.(ix) It would clearly not be right to put the North Atlantic Treaty countries(which include Canada) in a better position than the Commonwealth countries,and it is suggested that the Bill should also extend to the Commonwealth countries and that the Visiting Forces (British Commonwealth) Act, 1933, should be repealed.(x) Attention is drawn to paragraph (10) of Article VII, which provides that each Contracting Party shall seek such legislation as it deems necessary to ensurethe adequate security and protection within its territory of the installations, equip-ment, property, records and official information of the other Contracting Parties.The United Kingdom representatives pointed out that this provision was not altogether appropriate for inclusion in an agreement dealing with the status ofmembers of visiting forces, but other delegations pressed strongly for its retention,and it is suggested that we should not insist on its deletion. It might prove of value in respect of our own forces abroad.(xi) The United States representative originally proposed the inclusion of a paragraph in this Article providing in terms that in war-time the authorities of the visiting force should exercise exclusive jurisdiction. He agreed to the deletion ofthis paragraph; but it was clear that the Americans would expect, in the event ofwar, to renounce this Article under the terms of Article XV, and to exercise,exclusive jurisdiction. It would clearly be difficult to persuade the americans to accept less, in the event of another war, than they enjoyed in the last war, but itseems desirable that there should be no question of asking Parliament now to enactlegislation granting exclusive jurisdiction to visiting forces in time of war. TheUnited States delegation understand that the acceptance of their claim to beallowed to exercise exclusive jurisdiction in time of war would involve amending legislation after the outbreak of war. There is no obligation that any such legisla-tion, if introduced, would necessarily have to extend to all visiting forces.Article VIII7. (i) Provisions under this Article for the settlement of civil claims arisingout of acts committed by members of foreign visiting forces in the course of their duty are as satisfactory as we could reasonably hope to secure. The principles are established in paragraph 4 that when a claim arises from an act done by a memberof a force in the performance of his official duties he can be sued in the Courts ofthe receiving State but will be protected against enforcement of any judgmentagainst him personally. Legislation will be required to give effect to this principle in the United Kingdom. This procedure will not, however, prejudice the claimantsince the receiving State undertakes to pay the compensation awarded. As at presentdrafted, the last sub-paragraph of paragraph 4 excludes from these provisions all claims arising out of the navigation or operation of a ship or the loading, carriageor discharge of cargo. I propose to seek the addition at the end of the sub-paragraphof the words &quot; other than claims for death or personal injury &quot;; this would have the^
effect of bringing such claims within the procedure provided by paragraph 4.Under this procedure claims to which paragraph 4 applies will all be processedand paid for by the receiving State, but the payments incurred will be divided between the receiving State and the other State or States directly involved at half-yearly intervals in the proportions prescribed in paragraph 4 (e), (i) and (ii), ofthe Article. Here again we have to consider our position both as a sending andas a receiving State, though so far as can be foreseen, the United States is likely tobe, on balance, the principal sending State. If we had been dealing with themalone, the ideal solution would have been that claims should be dealt with by ourown claims authorities, who would be reimbursed in full by the United StatesGovernment. This proposal was in fact made in a bilateral approach to the UnitedStates Administration last summer, but the latter saw little prospect of being ableto accept it under their peace-time legislation. The present arrangement will at leastgive us 75 per cent, of the cost of claims against United States forces in this country,and it is arguable that for a receiving State to bear at least some proportion of theliability is both a recognition of the fact that the forces of the sending State have come to its territory for the purposes of collective North Atlantic defence and aguarantee to the sending State that the claims authorities of the receiving State willnot be over-generous in their assessment of claims against its forces. Claims for damage caused by members of a force otherwise than in the performance of their official duties (if not settled by an ex gratia payment by the sending State) can be pursued by legal proceedings against the offender in the normal manner.(ii) The Foreign Office Legal Adviser has pointed out that paragraph 7 of thisArticle is rather narrowly drawn, and has recommended that the last two lines ofthe paragraph should be amended to read &quot;. . . . in respect of the civil jurisdiction of the courts of the receiving State except as is provided by the preceding provisionsof this Article.&quot; The effect of this is to reserve the jurisdiction of British courtsover all other civil suits, e.g., Divorce, not otherwise covered by Article VIII.(iii) Attention should be drawn to a deficiency in this Article, from the pointof view of the United Kingdom, which it was not thought appropriate to make goodin the context of this Agreement. This deficiency consists in the fact that whilethe Article deals with claims by third parties against members of a force or civiliancomponent arising frOm their use of the motor vehicles of such forces, which willbe exempt from compliance with the compulsory insurance provisions of the road traffic Acts, there is no provision for dealing with claims against locally engagedcivilians who may be similarly employed. (Nationals of, or normal residents in, the receiving State are excluded from the definition of &quot; civilian component&quot; underArticle I (b)). I therefore propose that it should be made clear to the other contracting parties that civilians outside the scope of the definition of &quot; civiliancomponent &quot; shall not be permitted to drive service vehicles in the United Kingdomunless and until insurance, in accordance with Part II of the Road Traffic Act,1930, against their liabilities for third parties have been taken out in this country,and that legislation to implement the Agreement in the United Kingdom will bedrawn accordingly.(iv) It will be observed that this Article covers also maritime claims arisingfrom collisions, &amp;c, and salvage services as between vessels used by the ServicesMinistries of the countries concerned and caused in connexion with the operationof the North Atlantic Treaty.Article IX8. This Article deals with the local procurement of labour, goods and services by the sending State. The only paragraph requiring comment is paragraph 6,which requires us to give the most favourable consideration to requests for travellingfacilities and concessions with regard to fares to visiting forces and their civiliancomponents. If such requests are made special arrangements may be requiredin this country by reason of the fact that the British Transport Commission^ futurefares will be settled by the Transport Tribunal, which is an independent judicialbody.Article X9. This Article adopts the principle already in general use for national repre-sentatives on international bodies. The broad effect is that a member of a foreignforce will not be liable to United Kingdom income tax on his Service emoluments(though he may of course be taxed on them in his own country) and will not be
regarded as acquiring residence or as changing his domicile for taxation purposesby reason only of his temporary presence in this country as a member of such force.Article XVII10. This Article providing for accession to the Agreement by any State whichaccedes to the North Atlantic Treaty, has an important bearing on the position of western Germany. In the event that the German Federal Government accedesto the Treaty, we should not want to be committed by this Article to the applica-tion of the Agreement, at the sole discretion of the Federal Government, to ourown forces in Western Germany or to German Forces which might (though thisis unlikely) be serving outside Germany.The Allied High Commissioner is at present studying terms for a contractualarrangement with the Germans on, inter alia, the status of Allied forces inGermany, and I therefore propose to instruct the United Kingdom Deputy on theNorth Atlantic Council to propose an amendment to Article XVIII so as to permitaccession to the Agreement only with the approval of all the contracting parties and subject to any condition which they may impose.Conclusion11. The foregoing paragraphs show, I believe, that the draft Agreementrepresents a reasonable compromise between, on the one hand, the kind of con-cessions we would normally be prepared to grant to foreign visiting forces, and onthe other, those which other North Atlantic Treaty Governments are preparedto concede, and which we ourselves would require for our own forces abroad.I therefore ask my colleagues to authorise:  (i) instructions to the United Kingdom Deputy on the North Atlantic council that the provisions of the draft Agreement may be accepted, subjectto a reservation on the accession of the Federal German Republic andto any drafting or other minor amendments which may be found tobe necessary;(ii) the preparation of such legislation as may be required to implement theAgreement, in particular, that proposed in paragraph 6 (viii) of thismemorandum for the implementation of Article VII.H.
