January 1951The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited,   it is issued for the personal use of ..TOP SECRET Copy No. ^CP. (51) 19ISth January, 1951CABINETCIVIL DEFENCE PREPARATIONSMemorandum by the Home secretary as a result of the Cabinefs decision of 18th December, 1950 (CM. (50) 87thConclusions, Minute 1), various measures for accelerating defence preparations are coming before my colleagues. These include acceleration of some civil defence measures, already approved in principle, and certain new provision for stockpilingfor civil defence purposes. These are put forward in the report from the Defence(Transition) Committee (CP. (51) 18) on measures to be taken by civil departments in conformity with the new hypothesis for defence preparations. But they are of only limited extent, as is shown in paragraph 5 below. In fact the civil defence preparations approved by the Cabinet in July x950 (CM. (50) 50th Conclusions,Minute 2), which are being spread over a period of four years, cover only a very* limited part of the field of civil defence; as a result of the acceleration of the pro-gramme for the armed forces, civil defence preparations will lag even further than hitherto behind the preparations of the armed forces. As the Minister chargedwith general responsibility for co-ordinating civil defence measures, I feel it myduty to report this to the Cabinet and to ask my colleagues to decide whether it isin the national interest to limit our civil defence preparations to the projects already approved by the Cabinet and to the measures of acceleration recommended in cp. (51) 18.The Present situation. Before Acceleration. The main features of the present situation are asfollows:  (a) Civil defence preparations are at present proceeding on the basis of a four-year programme for the period ending on 31st March, 1955.(b) The programme is related to a planning date of 1957, and it is assumed thatin the interval between 1955 and 1957,there would be a rapid increasein the pace and scale of preparations in order that the large gaps whichare not covered by the four-year programme, and will therefore exist in 1955, may be largely filled by 1957.(c) Even those matters that are covered are only partially covered, since theexpenditure authorised in July last, related only to projects placed bythe Ministerial Committee on Civil Defence in the first of their three categories of priority, or approximately  137 million out of a total (forCategories I-III) of some  936 million.3. The following are the main projects provided for in the  137 million of category I expenditure:  (a) Recruitment and training of volunteers for the Civil Defence Services.(b) Emergency feeding arrangements.39993
(c) Telecommunications.(d) Civil defence war rooms.(e) A small amount of hospital building.(/) The civil warning system.(g) Production of new respirators for the general population.(h) Protected accommodation at Government buildings.(/) A beginning with arrangements to ensure the maintenance (or &quot; duefunctioning &quot;) of essential services (railways, gas, electricity, &amp;c.) in war.As regards the remainder of the field, the programme makes no provision for anything except paper planning, and accordingly it would not provide for equipment for the enlarged Fire Service and other Civil Defence Services, for emergency water supplies, for shelter for the public or industry, for buildings for rest centres, for equipment for hospitals, the homeless and evacuees, or for black-out; and theprovision made for hospital building and for the maintenance of essential services is too small to have any great significance.4. As a result of (a) recommendations by the Chiefs of Staff for the inclusionof provision for certain additional projects, and (b) revised estimates by Depart-ments of the cost of certain projects already included, the Ministerial Committeeon Civil Defence, on the basis of a report from the Official Committee, have recommended the addition of some  40 million to the  137 million programme,together with an addition (for which no precise estimate can yet be made) in respectof black-out preparations other than stockpiling. This would not have any sig-significant effect on the general position as described in the preceding paragraph.5. After Acceleration. As indicated in paragraph 1 above, in connection withthe measures for the acceleration of the rearmament programme, the Defence(Transition) Committee are recommending (in CP. (51) 18) certain measures onthe one hand of acceleration of civil defence preparations, and on the other hand of stockpiling of civil defence stores and equipment. The effect of the former (iffound practicable) would be to produce by the end of 1952 the state of preparednesscontemplated for 31st March, 1955, in respect of communications, warning system,war rooms and certain other items, and the effect of the latter would be to makeuseful provision for mobilisation stores and equipment for the Fire Service andother.Civil Defence Services, for hospital, evacuation and homeless services, and tocreate a very small reserve of Anderson shelters.The Prospect6. If all that is contemplated in the four-year programme, with the additionsand accelerations referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, is duly effected, the broadposition at the end of 1952 would be that a civil warning system covering the whole country (but less efficient than that which existed in the last war) would be estab-lished; there would be an adequate system of control and communications for theoperation of Civil Defence Services; and there would be in existence small forma-tions of Civil Defence Services reasonably well trained, but with little or none ofthe equipment required to enable them to operate in war; rudimentary planswould exist for extension of hospital services and for services for evacuees and thehomeless, but there will be grave shortages of equipment and stores; little or no provision would have been made for shelter for the public or industry, for emergencywater supplies or for the maintenance of essential services. By 1954 it might beexpected that the numbers of volunteers enrolled and trained would have been substantially increased and, on the assumption that the measures of stockpilingrecommended for 1952 were further developed, some of the deficiencies of stores and equipment would have been remedied, but in other respects the situation wouldbe no better than in 1952.7. The gaps which would remain would be large and serious. It is not suggested that in any event it would be practicable (owing to shortages of man-power and materials) to fill all these gaps by any given date, but there can be nodoubt that there is a great deal more which could be done. The ministerial committee on Civil Defence, with whom I have discussed this matter, take theview that an increase in the preparedness in the field of civil defence would not onlybe of value in the event of war, but would also supplement the effect of the rearmament programme in providing a deterrent against war. Accordingly, theythink that more extensive steps should be taken than are at present contemplated.
8.  Points for Decision. I ask the Cabinet  -*(a) To approve an increase in the authorised four-year programme from 137 million to  180 million (paragraph 4 above).(b) To decide whether the deficiencies in civil defence preparations over thenext few years can be accepted and, if not, on what hypothesis, asregards planning date and permissible degree of interference with thenational economy, I should make proposals for meeting thosedeficiencies.J. C. E.Home Office, S.W. 1,18th January, 1951.
