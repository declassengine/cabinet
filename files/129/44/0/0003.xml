[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret;P.(51) copy NO., 325TH JANUARY, 1951CABINETNEGOTIATIONS WITH THE NATIONAL UNION of mine WORKERS ABOUT WAGES, HOLIDAYS with pay AND SUPPLEMENTARY pensions memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and PowerIt is important to clarify the position of the Government, theNational Coal Board (N. C. B. ) and the National Union of Mineworkers (N. U. M. )in regard to the claims put forward by the N. U. M, in the light of what happenedat the Prime Minister&apos;s meeting with the Miners&apos; Executive.2. This must be done at once because the N. C.B. are meeting theN. Ui is/:,, next Wednesday (10th January) after several postponements and must know what line they can take.3. Before the Prime Minister&apos;s meeting, the N. Ui Mi. had unofficiallyput before the N. C. B fourteen or more claims involving many millions of pounds.4. One of the claims is, in a way, different from the rest.    It is that the incentive of double-time be paid to men who work on Saturdays, having already done five shifts.   At present, men working the Saturday shift get time and a halfirrespective of their attendance earlier in the week.   So this proposal hasperhaps a more direct bearing on immediate output than the others.    I refer to it again below.5. Of their other claims, the N. U. M, give first priority to an increasein wages for lower paid workers of 2/- a shift, costing about  10,000,000 or l/- a ton.The next two are:-(a)(b)Supplementary Pensions (a scheme the Board worked out would cost about 6d. a ton for the first three or four years),   andA second week&apos;s holiday with pay which would cost about  5,000,000and probably some loss of coal.6. As I understand tine Board&apos;s attitude, they believe that something can bedone which holds out hopes of more production in the rest of the coal winter(i.e. up to the end of April) and in the winters ahead, but they think that a declaration should be made quickly.7. One possibility is an incentive scheme to get full Saturday working,though not necessarily a scheme of the kind proposed by the N. U. M.b. Then there are measures to increase the attractiveness of theindustry and thus help recruitment and check the wastage of man-power.    TheBoard have not made up their mind finally, but if there is a scheme of extraSaturday payments it could perhaps 1 shade off into some wage advances forthe lower-paid workers at the beginning of the summer.
9. Meanwhile it seems likely that the Board will want to tell theN. U. M. on Wednesday that they are willing to negotiate an increase for thelower-paid workers;   also the terms of a pension scheme and arrangementsfor a second week&apos;s holiday with pay, the last two - pensions and the holidays -being in any case justified in the long run.10. The Board&apos;s present intention would be that the pensions schemeand the second week&apos;s holiday would not come into operation until output hasbeen raised to a certain level.    The supplementary pension scheme would start on1st January after the year in which deep mined output had reached207,000,000 tons;   this might possibly be 1st January, 1952.    The second week&apos;sholiday with pay would not start before 1952 and only then if output had reachedan agreed figure.   But the Board would like to be free (though they have not yetcome to a final decision themselves) to make the following further offer:-while there would be no second week&apos;s holiday this year, the Board should earmarka substantial proportion of the money equivalent (say  2 million) for starting offthe Pension Fund.11. The Board would tell the N. U. M.  that (quite apart from any schemefor full Saturday-working, if there is to be one) they were willing to proceed at once with negotiations, taking the wages claim first, on the definite understanding thatthe three claims - wages, holidays and pensions - were to be the only substantialones in 1951, and that the Union, in dealing with their members, made it clearthat the Board were acting with complete fairness and were not exploiting in anyway the willingness of the Union and of the men themselves to co-operate fully inthe crisis.    I am sure that the Board would add the condition that the ban on the recruitment of Italian workers should immediately be raised.12. It should, however, be recalled that last summer the N.C.B. were told by the Government that in accordance with the Government^ stabilisationpolicy they were not to offer more than a certain small increase in wages for lower-paid workers.    The N. U. ivi.  rejected this offer and took their claim to arbitration.Mr. Ebby Edwards argued the Board&apos;s (and Governments) case before theTribunal and lord Porter in effect rejected the N. U.M. claim and awarded a sumnot much in excess of the offer which the N. C. B. had made.   Subsequently, as aresult of strong appeals by the &quot;Labour&quot; leaders of the N. U. M.  (notablyMr. Sam Watson and Mr. Ernest Jones) the N. C. B.  (with the knowledge of theGovernment) added a substantial percentage to the Porter Award.    They did this with great hesitation for they feared it might lead to Lord Porter&apos;s resignation.They are reasonably satisfied, however    (on Mr. Ebby Edwards&apos; advice) that ifacting on their own responsibility they proceeded to negotiate on a claim for a furtherwage advance, they would not be undermining the authority of the Tribunal or therest of the conciliation machinery.    The situation has become so very grave sincethe last Award.13. To clarify the position, the questions which I suggest need to bedecided by the Government  - and they must be decided at once - are:-(1) Is the Government prepared to authorise the N. C.B.. to negotiate a further increase of the wages of the lower-paid workers?(2) If so, is the Government prepared to agree that the N. C.B.  should start the negotiations now ?)      (3) Is the Government prepared to tell the Board that they can startnegotiations for a supplementary pensions scheme on the principles set out in the Annex to this paper?     It would be understood, ofcourse, that if an agreement was reached between the N. C.B. andthe N. U. ivi. , the Minister of Fuel and Power would not withholdapproval.
(4) Is the Government prepared to tell the N. C. B. that they canstart negotiations for a second week&apos;s holiday with pay to beintroduced on 1st January the year after output has reached,say, 215 million tons?&apos;14. In submitting these questions for decision, I should remind mycolleagues of the vital need to increase man-power in the pits and of the pressstatement issued from Downing Street after the Prime Minister&apos;s meeting withthe N. U. M. Executive on Wednesday last, in which the Government expressed theconfidence&quot;that the negotiations at present taking place between theNational Coal Board and the National Union of Mine worker swill be continued in a sympathetic spirit&quot;.P.

ANNEXPrinciples to govern a supplementary pensions Scheme for Miners1. The scheme will probably have to apply to all manual workers in thecoal-mining industry.   The N.C.B. should, however, try to confine it to underground(workers.   (This will be difficult.   Brickworkers in the Board&apos;s employment are inreceipt of pensions as a result of an agreement covering brickworkers generally).2. Cost not to exceed about 6d.exceed about 8d. a ton of coal ultimately.a ton of coal at the start and not to3. Contributions to be about Z/- a week on a 50:50 basis at the start,with provision for linking pensions to output, by an increase in the Board&apos;contribution (the miners&apos; contribution remaining unchanged) as output increases[on the lines indicated in the Board&apos;s proposals.Benefits.(a) Pensions and lump sum payments on retirement at 65 should be linkedto output and attendance, and should be on the scales recommended by the Board.lit should be noted that under the 3oard&apos;s scheme the maximum pension and gratuitypan only be earned by a man who has worked every possible shift for 40 yearspfter the total annual output of deep mined coal has been over Z30 million tons. )(b) There should be provision, as proposed by the Board, for continuedSvork after 65 to carry an increase of pension and gratuity.(c)There should be provision for&apos; a Widows pension.(d) Men leaving the industry before they have done a reasonable periodjf service in the mines should not get their pensions back, but gratuities should belaid to miners leaving the industry after a reasonable length of service and beforecaching 65, corresponding to a return of contributions plus 3% compound interestUs proposed by the Board.(e)tendance.Benefits should be linked not only to total output but to individual(f) Back service credit should be given, but should be limited on the linesoposed by the Working Party.(g) Pensions on retirement on ill-health must be subject to suitablefeguards.Any proposals resulting from negotiations with the N. U. M. must betted by the Government actuary before approval by the Minister.
