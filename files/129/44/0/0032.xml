!STY&apos;S 0The circulation  of this  paper has been strictly limited.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT^    ^TOP SECRET Copy No*32CP;(51) 3224TH JANUARY, 1951CABINETINCREASED DEFENCE expenditure memorandum by the Prime minister the Defence Committee have held a preliminary discussion of theproposals for increased defence programmes which are now before theCabinet.   It may help to focus the Cabinefs discussion if I indicate briefly the provisional views which I have formed on some of these proposals inthe light of the Defence Committee 1 s discussion.PROPOSALS OF THE CHIEFS OF STAFF (CP. (51) 16)2. Man-Power.(a) navy the Defence Committee were disposed to support the proposalsfor the call-up of reservists for the Navy (paragraph 9 of CP. (51) 16).(b) army the Defence Committee endorse the proposal to call up &apos;Z&apos; Classreservists for 15 days training (paragraph 10).The proposal to call up some of these reservists for three months(paragraph 11) is, however, more difficult.   I accept the argument thatthis plan would improve substantially the efficiency of the active Army,both in Germany and at home.   And I do not think that the economicargument against it can prevail.   But I invite the Cabinet to weigh thetwo serious political objections to it:-   (i) the method of selection must bearbitrary and involves unfairness between man and man;   and (ii) the partial mobilisation which it involves might be politically acceptableonly if we created such a climate of public opinion as might lead towidespread acceptance of the view that war is now inevitable.The Defence Committee do not favour the proposal (paragraph 11 (vii))to reduce the embarkation age for reinforcements to Korea to 18 years and months.(c) Royal Air force the proposals for increasing the man-power of the R. A. F.(paragraphs 13 and 14) are not open to the same objections, since theyinvolve only the recall of reservists with a liability for service.
(d) National Service IntakeSubject to the views expressed by the Agriculture Ministers,I am inclined to think that we must now discontinue the policy of deferringagricultural workers (paragraph 18(a)).   We must also call up more-men of lower medical categories (paragraph 18(b)).   I see great difficultyin differentiating between categories of apprentices and students(paragraph 19) and the Services are against reducing the age of registrationto 18 (paragraph 20).   A shortfall of 35,000 must, I think, be accepted.3. Production.     The Cabinet will wish to be satisfied that., giventhe probable shortages of raw materials and machine tools, it is.realistic to assume that we shall be able to achieve the productionprogrammer proposed in tart II jf CP. (51) 16 as well as the minimumexport target set by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in CP. (51) 20.It is essential that we should announce to Parliament (and to the americans) a realistic programme which we can carry through, andnot an ambitious target which we are unlikely to reach in practice.We must also be able to explain the phasing of the programme and theperiod at which its economic impact on industry and on the public will begin to be felt.PROPOSALS OF THE DEFENCE (TRANSITION) CGiViMITTEE(CP. (51) 18)4. The Defence Committee do not endorse the suggestions (i) foraccelerating the preparations for a black-out (paragraph 6(b)) and (ii))for accumulating a stockpile of black-out materials (Annex).With this exception, they support the recommendations in thisreport for accelerating the defence planning of civil Departments generally.I invite the special attention of the Cabinet to the recommendations on the redeployment of administrative resources (paragraphs 18 - 20).These are in line with the recommendation in paragraph 33 of the memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (51) 2 3).CIVIL DEFENCE (CP. (51) 19)The Defence Committee endorse the Home Secretary&apos;s proposal that the authorised programme 2f expenditure on Civil Defence in thenext four years should be increased from  13 7 millions to  180 millions.6. On the second of the questions raised by the Home Secretary the DefencgCommittee took the view that, so long as the Government^ policy is directed towards averting war by strengthening our active defences, it isnot illogical that Civil Defence preparations should be allowed to lagbehind.    They recognised that this might give rise to some political difficulties.    On the 3ther hand, they considered that - quite apart fromthe enormous cost which it would involve - any general acceleration ofcivil defence preparation (such, for example, as the provision of publicshelter) would lead to political difficulties of another kind by giving theimpression that the Government regarded war as inevitable.C.
