THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1951SECRET . Copy No.   3CP. (51) 651st March, 1951CABINETKOREAMemorandum by the Minister of State .-My colleagues may like to have the following brief factual account of recent developments concerning Korea.Re-crossing the 3%th Parallel.2. It will be recalled that on 12th February the Cabinet approved a recom-mendation that confirmation should be obtained from the United StatesGovernment that there would be close consultation with other interested Govern-ments and, in particular, with those contributing forces in Korea, before united nations Forces7 again advanced beyond the 38th Parallel.3. The formal views of the United States Government on this question havenow been made known by Mr. Dean Rusk, of the State Department, at a meeting in Washington of Ambassadors of those countries contributing forces in korea and have been confirmed in a written statement handed to His Majesty&apos;ambassador on 20th February. According to this statement, the United StatesGovernment does not now contemplate the conduct of major operations on thepart of presently available United Nations Forces, to seize the territory of NorthernKorea, and at present a &quot; massive movement &quot; of such forces into Northern Koreais not probable. It was added that there would be time to consider the question ofa major crossing of the 38th Parallel when this became a more immediate problem and that the United States Government would, at the appropriate time, consult with other members of the United Nations participating in military operations in korea. A decision at the present time is considered by the United States Govern-ment to be premature, but they would provide every opportunity for consultationsand would make every effort to achieve as much agreement as possible.4. No formal reply has yet been received from Mr. Acheson to the approach which His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador was instructed to make. The latter has beenasked whether, in view of the statement quoted in the preceding paragraph, anyfurther communication will be forthcoming, and has been warned that we may have some comments on points of detail. In general, however, the statement already made is satisfactory to us, and, taken with the statement made by general macarthur at a press conference in Tokyo on 19th February, to the effect that hewould not use the authority given him by the President for the conduct of militaryoperations arbitrarily to cross the 38th Parallel in force if there were cogentpolitical reasons against doing so, appears to give the assurance for which we have asked, and to meet our requirements.40218
Military Developments5. The progress made, as a result of the reconnaissance in force begun on25th January, has been maintained, and a Chinese and North Korean counter-offensive has been held. Although the possibility of a further Chinese offensiveis not excluded, it now seems likely that a position of stalemate may shortly bereached approximately on the line of the 38th Parallel. ...... ........Political and United Nations Developments6. Although a continued stalemate, such as that referred to in the preceding paragraph, could not be contemplated indefinitely by the United States and our-selves, it is considered that such a position could at least be held for a limited time,and that it might provide the best opportunity for negotiation and a peaceful settlement. Mr. Entezam, the Chairman of the Good Offices Committee, set upas a result of the General Assembly&apos;s Resolution of 1st February, has sent a message to the Peking Government, but we do not know its contents. It is under-stood that Mr. Entezam sent the message in his capacity as President of theAssembly rather than as Chairman of the Good Offices Committee. The reasonfor this was doubtless the Chinese Foreign Ministers recent statement that hisGovernment will have nothing to do with the Good Offices Committee, and thatthe resolution of 1st February was &quot; illegal &quot; and an &quot; insult &quot; to China.7. The Indian Ambassador in Peking has been asked by the Indian Govern-ment whether, since military operations in Korea were no longer going favourablyfor China, this would in his view be a suitable time for an approach to the ChineseGovernment in an attempt to bring the Powers concerned to discussions. It appearsthat the Indian Government were considering, if their Ambassador^ reactions were favourable, that they might then approach us to see whether concerted action couldbe taken with China and the United States to arrange a meeting. Previously theSwedish Minister in New Delhi had intimated to the Indian Government that his information was that the Chinese might now be prepared to enter discussions out-side the United Nations, and that his Government thought that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment might be prepared to make a move. I do not, however, considerthat His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Peking should at this stage be authorisedto make any approach to the Chinese Government. Such action was considered at the beginning of February, when it was felt that a further approach in face of thecontinued lack of initiative from the Chinese side would be undignified and mightonly delay the possibility of a change of heart on the part of the Chinese induced,from their point of view, by the deteriorating military situation. These argumentsare in my view still valid. Moreover, we are anxious that any arrangements fora conference should be made under United Nations auspices, and not, as theChinese appear to desire, outside the United Nations and on their own terms.8. Sweden is a member of the Good Offices Committee and is also repre-sented in Peking, and might, therefore, offer an appropriate channel for communica-tion with the Chinese Government. It is understood that the message fromMr. Entezam, referred to in paragraph 6 above, has been sent through this channel.9. Meanwhile, the Additional Measures Committee, set up by the resolution of 1st February, has held one private meeting, at which it appointed a bureau ofthree representatives (Turkey, Belgium and Australia) to draw up a programmeof work and to maintain liaison with the Good Offices Committee. A preliminaryexchange of views on the type and efficacy of political and economic sanctionsthat might be employed against China is now taking place at desk-level in washington. As regards political sanctions, the American views regarding the recognition of the Central People&apos;s Government and the representation of this government in the United Nations have long been, and remain, at variance withour own. On the type of economic sanctions which might, in the last resort, haveto be employed, American views at official level do not seem to differ greatly from our own, namely, that the only practical action which the United Nations could take would be a limited embargo on strategic goods. They believe, however, morethan we do, in the efficacy of such a measure and, indeed, of economic sanctionsgenerally.10. There seems to be a tendency on the part of the Americans to push ahead with the study of sanctions rather faster than we, for our part, would wish to do.
Foreign Office, S.W. 1.1st March, 1951.It is obvious that the Good Offices Committee must be given all possible freedomof manoeuvre and latitude.,.in which to function. The Americans, of course,appreciate this but they give the impression that they want something cut and dried(for example; a United Nations Resolution on Sanctions) to produce at the earliest moment on the assumption that the Good Offices Committee will fail in its task.11. Both Sir Gladwyn Jebb and Sir Oliver Franks have been instructea tomake it, clear that, as our main purpose is to try to start negotiations with theChinese for a peaceful settlement, the work of the Additional Measures Committeeshould not be allowed to run ahead of that of the Good Offices Committee, andthat it is essential that the latter should be allowed to do all it can to pave the way for negotiations in a calm atmosphere.^JV&apos;&quot;,-&apos;&apos; K.
