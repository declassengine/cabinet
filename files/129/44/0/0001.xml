This appointment iseminently satisfactory. It is a great step forward in the organisationof Western defence and should have a heartening effect on opinion throughout Europe.(ii) There was 12-Power agreement that the present defence effort of the atlantic countries was inadequate and must be stepped up: The Ameri-cans took the lead in announcing a great increase in the American effort and we were able to place ourselves at their side in calling for greater* sacrifices for defence. Alone of all the other representatives at the atlantic Council I was in a position to announce His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment&apos;s intention of accelerating their defence preparations.(iii) There was 12-Power agreement on the conditions of a German contributionto the defence of Europe (the Spofford Plan) and, more important,3-Power agreement that this question should not be rushed.Mr. Acheson, M. Schuman and myself all agreed without difficulty thatit was undesirable to hand any document to the Germans or to put them a question which required the answer &quot; Yes &quot; or &quot; No.&quot; TheHigh Commissioners were merely to discuss the matter with the Chan-cellor on the basis of the Councils report.(iv) There was also 3-Power agreement that the association of Germany withthe defence of the West would logically carry with it an evolution inthe relationship between the Three Occupying Powers and the federal government; and that progress on the part or Germany in defence matters would entitle her to corresponding advances in freedom andequality. We have thus laid down principles for the future developmentof our relations with Germany, on the basis of which the High Commis-sioners can carry on their detailed negotiations with the GermanGovernment.(v) There was 3-Power agreement on the terms of a reply to the Russianproposal for a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers. The text of the agreed reply has now been handed to the Soviet Governmentand published. I made it quite clear that there was a strong feeling in the United Kingdom that a genuine attempt should be madeto negotiate with the Russians and that this attempt must be made by ministers and not by officials. Mr. Acheson gave me to understandquite definitely that the United States did not exclude a meeting of theCouncil of Foreign Ministers. They thought it essential, however, that39854
Foreign Office, S.W. 1,1st January, 1951.preliminary discussion should take place in order to explore Sovietintentions and ensure that a meeting of Foreign Ministers, if it was held,was held in conditions favourable to the Western Powers.;vM (Yi)-lThe meeting of the Brussels Treaty Consultative Council undoubtedlyenhanced the leadership of the United Kingdom in this inner Europeangroup. The confidential explanation which I was able to igiveJof themanner in which it had been decided to handle the German question was received by the Foreign Ministers of Holland, Belgium aha*  uScem-bourg with great satisfaction and with protestations of confidence in us.(vii) There was implicit, if not explicit,, agreement that the French plan for a european Army should be given a fair wind. This prospect of ideasfor integration dominating the evolution of relationships between germany and France may present difficulties for us in the future.I think hiy colleagues will agree that these results were satisfactory. We were successful in obtaining our principal objective in regard to European defence bythe appoiritrnent of General Eisenhower as Supreme Commander and the recogni-tion of the need to increase the Atlantic defence effort. In all public statementsthis rightiy received the first emphasis. At the same time we succeeded in avoiding any action with regard to German rearmament which would have tempted theRussians into aggressive action, and, moreover, by our agreement on the3-Power reply to the Soviet Union, in leaving open an area of negotiation betweenEast and West. Finally, from the purely United Kingdom point of view, we were able to reassert our leadership in Europe.
