THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1951SECRET Copy No.   31CP. (51) 749th March, 1951CABINETPOLICY TOWARDS germany memorandum by Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Cabinet may find it useful at the present time, when preparations are beingmade for a Four-Power Meeting, to have a further general review of the progressof our German policy. They will recall that in my memoranda CP. (49) 237 of16th November, 1949, CP. (50) 80 of 26th April, 1950, and CP. (50) 222 of6th October, 1950, I discussed the problems dealt with at the meetings of theForeign Ministers of the three Western Occupation Powers in Paris in November1949, in London in May 1950 and in New York in September 1950. These meetingsmarked the main stages in the development of our relations with the german federal Government since it was set up a year and a half ago.2. During the whole of that period it has been our policy gradually to buildup the prestige and authority of that Government and to bring it and german public opinion to opt in favour of full association with the West. After the Parismeeting this policy was affirmed in the Petersberg Protocol, the first importantagreement concluded on a basis of contract between the High Commissioners ofthe Occupation Powers and the German Federal Chancellor. After the Londonmeeting the three Governments announced their desire to see rapid progress made towards Germany&apos;s liberation from controls and recovery of her sovereignty to themaximum extent compatible with the basis of the occupation regime; they declaredthat the pace of such progress would be determined by the extent to which theAllies could be satisfied that their own security was safeguarded by the development in Germany of a desire for peace and friendly co-operation with themselves andof conditions in which true democracy governed and the just liberties of theindividual were assured. After the New York meeting, held after the North atlantic council had first discussed the formation of an integrated force for the defenceof Europe in which Germany should participate, the three Occupation Powersdeclared that, in return for certain undertakings from the German Federal Govern-ment consonant with its new responsibilities, they were prepared to amend theOccupation Statute so as to provide for major extensions of the Federal Govern-menfs authority; they further stated that they would treat an attack from any quarter against the Federal Republic or Berlin as an attack upon themselves andthat they would reinforce their forces of occupation in Germany in order to enablethem more effectively to discharge their role as security forces for the protectionof Germany and the rest of the free world.3. The carrying into effect of the New York decisions on relaxation of theoccupation controls has taken longer than expected. One of the two undertakings which the Federal Government was required to furnish related, as explained inparagraph 7 of CP. (50) 222, to its responsibility in respect of the pre-war Germanexternal debt and post-war economic assistance. The German Federal Chancellordecided that before giving this undertaking he must secure the consent of theFederal Parliament. This decision led to protracted discussions on the German side and it is only now that agreement has been reached upon a form of undertakingacceptable to all concerned. The other undertaking, relating to the equitableapportionment of scarce raw materials, had been secured some time ago.  It has40256 b
accordingly now been possible for the Allies to promulgate the promised revisionof the Occupation Statute, as agreed upon in New York, providing for the estab-lishment of a German Ministry for Foreign Affairs, the abolition of the procedure for prior review of all German legislation and other relaxations of Allied controls.Corresponding revisions have also been made in the Charter of the Allied high commission. The relevant documents have been laid before Parliament in twoWhite Papers.4. It is satisfactory that these changes have at last been brought into force.But in fact they no longer in themselves meet the needs of the present situation;as stated in paragraph 12 of CP. (40) 222, they were regarded five months ago,when they were decided upon, as no more than provisional and it was then agreedthat further changes would be required once a decision had been reached on german participation in European defence. Moreover, progress on other mattersdecided upon in New York has been disappointing. It has still not been possible to announce the termination of the state of war, partly because of constitutional delays in the United States but chiefly because the necessary legislation putting an end to the consequences of the state of war in German domestic law has not yet been passed by the German Federal Parliament. No progress has been made with theestablishment of the proposed German mobile police force, because of constitu-tional difficulties, particularly over finance, between the Federal and Landauthorities, arising out of the Allied decision, taken on French insistence, that theforce, while subject to a measure of central control, must be organised on a Landbasis. Nor has final agreement yet been reached among the three Allies either onthe complicated questions of claims, foreign interests and restitution, which werereserved at New York for further tripartite study, or on the important matter ofthe further revision of the controls over German industry contained in the Prohibitedand Limited Industries Agreement of 8th April, 1949. On this last question thedelay has been mainly due to the unwillingness of the French Government hithertoto agree to any important relaxations before agreement has been reached not onlyon the Schuman Plan for coal and steel but also on the nature and timing of aGerman contribution to Western defence.5. Developments in connexion with a German defence contribution have ofcourse had a close bearing upon the question Of the evolution of our political relations with Germany ever since the New York meeting. Those developments have been fully described in the Minister of State&apos;s memorandum CP. (51) 43 of 7th February, 1951. Here I need only recall that even before the New Yorkmeeting the Germans, understanding the lessons of Korea, had been pressing for an allied guarantee of their security. With the announcement of the New Yorkdecisions and thanks to the inevitable but unfortunate publicity that attended the subsequent discussions of the North Atlantic Treaty Powers on the conditions under which a German defence contribution should be sought, the convictionsteadily grew in Germany that the precondition of such a contribution must be, inthe words of the resolution submitted by the German Federal Government to the bundestag in the foreign affairs debate on 8th November, &quot; the complete equality of Germany in this defensive front with the other participating Powers and further that the defensive front shall be of sufficient strength to make any Russian aggres-sion impossible.&quot; The Social Democrat opposition went further and insisted that aGerman contribution should be refused so long as Germany remained subject toan occupation regime based upon unconditional surrender. This line of argumentwas in tune with German opinion which, disillusioned by defeat and taught thatdemilitarisation was one of the main objectives of Allied policy, was reluctant totake up arms, sensitive to the risks and burdens that rearmament involved and increasingly aware that the apparent eagerness of the Allies for German helpprovided an opportunity which might not recur for securing further concessions from them in the political field. Communist propaganda from East Germanysought to play upon these feelings by urging the West Germans to resist attemptsby the Western Occupation Powers to &quot; impose &quot; rearmament and by calling upon all Germans in West and East to work together in pursuit of &quot; unity and peace,&quot; ascontrasted with the Western policy of &quot; division and war.&quot; The German federal chancellor, like most of his countrymen, had no illusions about the motives of theRussians and their agents in putting forward such proposals for the unification anddemilitarisation of Germany. But he expressed concern about the possible long-term effect of this propaganda upon German opinion unless the Western OccupationPowers could hold out hopes of a radical change in their relationship with Germany
if the question of a German defence contribution were pursued. Accordingly, beforethe meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Brussels in December 1950, hereiterated a proposal he had made in August &quot; that the relations of Germany to theOccupation Powers be placed on a new basis and that they be progressivelyregulated by a system of contractual agreements.&quot; He stated that he consideredthe early realisation of this proposal to be urgently necessary in the new circum-stances that had arisen.6. The Foreign Ministers of the three Occupation Powers considered thismatter when they met in Brussels in December after the North Atlantic council had reached agreement upon the establishment of an integrated defence force inEurope and had authorised the Occupation Powers to discuss with the german federal Government the question of German participation in this force on the linesOf a plan adopted by the Council. The Foreign Ministers decided that their first objective should continue to be the implementation of the decisions reached in new York. They resolved, however, that the time had come to institute the further review of occupation controls foreseen at New York and instructed the Allied high commission, while pursuing the question of a German defence contribution, to study also in consultation with the German authorities the changes in the existingoccupation arrangements that might logically attend such a contribution. In making this study the High Commission were to bear in mind that the entry of Germanyinto Western defence arrangements would entitle it to substantial freedom and thatthe goal should be to establish the relations between the Occupation Powers andGermany on as broad a contractual basis as possible, through arrangements whichshould cover all aspects of those relations excepting such problems as can be resolved only in a peace settlement.7. As explained in CP. (51) 43, the exploratory discussions which have sincetaken place at Bonn on the subject of a German contribution to European defencehave revealed that in the opinion of the German Federal Government it will benecessary, in order to ensure the passage through the Bundestag of the necessarylaw authorising any such contribution, to demonstrate not only that Allied forcesin Germany have been substantially strengthened and that the future german forces will enjoy genuine equality of status with other national contingents, but alsothat on the political side arrangements (as envisaged at Brussels) are being madeto replace the Occupation Statute by a contractual regime. I have recentlyreviewed our relations with the German Federal Government in the light of these developments. The results of this review are embodied in the annexed despatch no. 77 of 23rd February to the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Germany.It will be seen that I consider that, while the Occupation Powers must not formallyabandon their supreme authority in Germany until there is a peace treaty, exami-nation of all the matters which might form the subject of contractual arrangements with the German Federal Government should now be proceeded with as speedilyas possible, with a view to the conclusion and execution of agreements on matters which are unrelated to defence and provisional agreement on those matters wherethe execution of the agreement must be made dependent on a German defence con-tribution. The bringing into effect of the New York decisions on revision of theOccupation Statute has now cleared the way for implementation of this policy.A first step towards carrying it out has already been taken with the communication to the German authorities for their comments of an agreed list of thirty-nine items which in the view of the Allied High Commission will require joint examinationfor the purpose of preparing the way for the conclusion of contractual arrange-ments over as wide a field as possible.8. We must recognise that to carry our declared policy forward with the speed and resolution the situation demands will require not only a sustained effort on thepart of the Allies as well as of the Germans but also certain sacrifices from all con-cerned. We have now reached a stage at which we can only succeed in the measurethat we carry with us willingly and by consent both the German people and theFederal Government that we have been instrumental in creating and endowingwith the power to decide Germany&apos;s future in accordance with its view of Germany^interests and the democratically expressed wishes of the German people. TheGermans have much to learn about the normal give and take of international inter-course. But it has not always been entirely the fault of their shortcomings that inthe past the impression has all too often been created in their minds that the Aliiesalways offer too little and too late and that they do not always match their affirmations-tions with deeds. The rate of progress on any problem is bound to be that of the40256 B 2
slowest among the three Occupation Powers. And the cumulative effect of hesitation-tions on the part of one or the other of the Allies on a series of different problemscan well be serious. Thus, while all three Occupation Powers affirm their desire to bind Germany to the West as a free and equal partner, special, and on their own merits perfectly legitimate, interests in one or the other country demand, forexample, that the Americans continue to intervene actively in the fields of decon-centration or restitution, that the French continue to delay relaxation of industrialcontrols until their requirements of Ruhr coke are met, that the RAF. continueto use Heligoland as a bombing target until an alternative site is found. in handling the forthcoming negotiations with the Germans we must ourselves ensureand be ready to insist with our Allies that such special interests, however legitimate,are not permitted cumulatively to foil our agreed policy.9. In particular we must bear in mind that the policy on which we are nowembarked of reinforcing our troops of occupation in Germany will seriously increasethe financial and psychological burden of the occupation on the Germans and bringgrave difficulties in its train unless we take full advantage of every opportunity thatoffers of finding compensating alleviation in every possible field. We must, forexample, make further drastic cuts in the strength of the Control Commission; andthat is only possible if we first decide as a matter of policy to give up further controlfunctions.10. At a time when we are approaching four-Power talks with the Russiansconcerning Germany it is of the utmost importance that our policies shouldcommand general acceptance in Germany and not be handicapped by unnecessaryirritants. And if those talks should lead to agreement on the means of re-creating a united Germany, which must inevitably be placed, initially at least, under some form of four-Power supervision, it will be essential that in order to reduce therisk of Russian interference and mischief-making we should be able to ensure thatsuch supervision is restricted to matters of real moment and exercised in accordancewith agreed rules that enable the German Government to function as freely and effectively as possible. We shall be greatly assisted in achieving that end if in themeantime we can make good progress towards eliminating all inessential powers of intervention from our own relations with the present Federal Government at Bonn.11. If the present preliminary talks in Paris lead to agreement on an agenda fora meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers, I propose to circulate to mycolleagues a further paper containing recommendations on the policy to be adopted at such a meeting in regard to the question of German unity.E.

ANNEXDEVELOPMENT OF RELATIONS WITH THE german federal government policy of His Majesty&apos;s GovernmentMr. Bevin to Sir I. Kirkpatrick, United Kingdom High Commissioner in Germany(No. 77.  Confidential)    Foreign Office,Sir, 23rd February, 1951.I have had under review the question ofthe development of the relations between his Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom and the German Federal Govern-ment in the light of the decisions taken bythe North Atlantic Council in December1950 and of subsequent developments.2. As was stated in my telegram No. 16,Saving, to Paris of 3rd January, the questionof our relationship with the German federal republic must always be considered in thelight of our relations with the Soviet union in Europe and of the overriding importanceof ensuring that the whole of Germany shallnot fall under Soviet Communist domina-tion. Our success in this task depends in thelast resort on our ability to convince theGermans that neutrality between East and west is impossible for them and that close association with the West offers them theonly opportunity of achieving and preservingtheir freedom and prosperity. It was withthis conviction in mind that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have worked steadily over thelast years, first, to establish the federal government; secondly, to foster its authority and prestige, and thirdly to bring the federal government and German public opinion toopt in favour of full association with theWest.- 3. At the North Atlantic Council inDecember last the North Atlantic treaty powers approved proposals for the estab-lishment in Europe of an integrated force for the defence of Western Europe, and reached agreement on the part which Ger-many might assume in the common defence.The Council further decided to invite the occupying Powers to discuss with theGerman Federal Government the questionof German participation in the defence of western Europe along the lines set out inthe Military Committee&apos;s and the Deputies&apos;Reports. The three Foreign Ministers there-upon authorised their respective High Com-missioners, in discussions with the Govern-ment of the Federal Republic, further to explore this problem on the basis of the council&apos;s proposals as well as any changesin the present occupation arrangements which might logically attend a Germandefence contribution.4: In his speech in the House of commons on 12th February the Prime Minister stated:&quot; We have accepted the need for a Contribu-tion from Germany, but the time, method and conditions will require a great deal ofworking out. There is, first of all, the pro-vision of arms. Obviously, the rearmamentof the countries of the Atlantic Treaty mustprecede that of Germany. Second, I think the building up of forces in the democraticStates should precede the creation of Ger-man forces. Third, the arrangements must be such that German units are inte-grated in the defence forces in a way whichwould preclude the emergence again of aGerman military menace. Fourth, theremust be agreement with the Germans them-selves.&quot;5. Agreement with the Germans, as youyourself have pointed out, depends uponthe Federal Government^ satisfying them-selves on three points before they will feel able to secure the vote in the Bundestagwhich will authorise the raising of Germanunits.  These three points are:  (1) The substantial reinforcement of theWestern forces in Europe.(2) Military equality of status for theGerman contingent.(3) The replacement of the occupation statute by a contractual regime.6. It is with the last of these points that Iam particularly concerned here. Your Excel-lency will be aware that the communique
of the three Foreign Ministers of 20thDecember last referred to &quot; changes in thepresent occupation arrangements whichmight logically attend a German denfence contribution.&quot; It is, however, still my viewthat, as expressed in my telegram No. 16,Saving, to Paris, the process of transferringauthority to the Federal Government shouldcontinue whatever form the association ofthe Federal Republic in Western defencemay take, and it is still my belief that the occupying Powers have more to gain by bringing the inevitable changes about grace-fully arid rapidly rather than grudgingly andtoo late.1.1 recognise that the transfer by theoccupation authorities of reserved powers inrespect of questions of defence and otherrelated matters may not be practicable until a decision has been taken by the federal government in regard to their participation in a Western integrated force. There is, how-ever, no reason why the examination of allthe various matters which might form thesubject of contractual agreements with theFederal Government should not be begunat once both by the High Commission and bythe Germans, with a view to the immediateconclusion and execution of agreements on matters which are unrelated to defence and provisional agreement on those matters where the execution of the agreement mustbe made dependent on a German contribu-tion to Western defence. In this connexion,the question of the retention of supreme authority by the Occupying Powers arises. Iunderstand that the Federal Governmentwill be unwilling formally to recognise thatthe Occupying Powers retain a supreme authority which might enable them to revokecontractual agreements made with theFederal Government. On the other hand, solong as Germany remains divided and solong as the present uncertainty in the inter-national situation continues, I am not pre-pared to agree to the formal abandonment ofthe supreme authority until there is a peace treaty. I am therefore ready to leave thisquestion as it stands, to be considered later in the light of the international situation andof the development of our relations with theFederal Government as a result of the con-clusion of contractual agreements in variousfields.8. The development of our relations withthe Federal Government and the closer association of that Government with theWestern Powers makes it important thatthose Powers should, in their dealings withthe Federal Government, bear constantly inmind that our eventual objective is full andequal partnership for Germany. This endcan only be gradually attained, and for itsattainment efforts will be required from bothsides. Your Excellency should continue in public and in private to emphasise that HisMajesty&apos;s Government are prepared to remedy legitimate German grievances andto do all they properly can to remove theremaining obstacles to better Anglo-german relations. But the Federal Government andthe German people should be brought torealise at the same time that, if our relations were to develop harmoniously in the directionof partnership, concessions on the side of the occupying Powers must be accompanied byconcrete evidence that the Federal Govern-ment are equally conscious of the need for both patience and sacrifices on their side.I have here immediately ift mind the questionof the debts settlement and the fulfilment of the New York agreements which is dependent thereon, as well as the conduct ofa German policy which must take account ofthe legitimate interests and requirements ofthe Western Powers.9. Whilst these political conversations arebeing conducted, and it is not the desire ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government to prolong themunnecessarily, you are authorised to continuethe military conversations which havealready been initiated. To abandon themnow would be a gratuitous blow to the prestige of the Federal Government. Butyour Excellency should bear in mind thatthey should not outrun the political discus-sions and that there is no advantage to be gained in bringing them to a head until agreement has been reached on the politicaldiscussions. In consequence, you should doyour best to induce the Federal Governmentand your colleagues to concentrate their attention mainly on the task of replacing theremaining reserved powers under theOccupation Statute as soon as possible by aseries of contractual arrangements.10. If you consider that this necessarilylong process can be eased by the issue of adeclaration of intention by the WesternOccupation Powers you are authorised todiscuss with your colleagues and the federal government the terms of such a declaration and to make recommendations as to itstiming. (In this connexion please see my telegram No. 126.)11. You will be guided by the above inyour conduct of affairs in the High Commis-sion arid in your dealings with the federal government and in conversations with youicolleagues and with individual Germans!
In so far as the attitude of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment towards the rearmament ofGermany is concerned, you should in par-ticular be guided by the Prime Minister^statement of l2th February quoted above.In reply to enquiries you are authorised tosay that His Majesty&apos;s Government have notmodified in principle the attitude theyadopted at New York and Brussels in thismatter but&quot; have made it clear that in their view the timing, method and condition of aGerman contribution will require carefulconsideration. In the political negotiationsregarding the conclusion of contractualagreements, you should be guided by theprinciples stated above, and you have authority to make it clear, at your discretion,that these principles represent the policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government.12. In view of the very great political interest attaching to questions relating toGermany, it is important that any statementsor speeches your Excellency may makeshould be in harmony with the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government. I do not suggest thatyou should discontinue your practice ofmaking the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment known to Germany in speeches in yourcapacity as High Commissioner, but I con-sider it advisable that you should refer the text of such speeches to the Foreign office for approval in advance whenever possible.I am, &amp;c.ERNEST BEVIN.
