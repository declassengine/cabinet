ItHlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF-HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(51) 43 COPY NO. 3*17TH FEBRUARY, 1951CABINETGERMAN REARMAMENTMemorandum by the Minister of state in the course of their discussion of the Soviet proposal for ameeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers the Cabinet considered theeffect of German rearmament as a bargaining factor at any meeting with the Russians and was concerned about the timing of the discussionsnow going forward with the German Federal Government on this subject(CM,(51) 11th Conclusions, Minute 6).     The Minute ends with the sentence:-&quot;The Cabinet had decided in principle in favour of a german contribution to Western defence, but there would have to bevery careful examination of all the issue&apos;s involved before a decision was taken on the manner and timing of german rearmament. &quot;2. I circulate, as an Annex to this paper, a statement setting out thepresent position in regard to German rearmament and showing preciselyto what extent His Majesty&apos;s Government are engaged and committed inthis matter up to the present moment.     The broad conclusion which canbe drawn from this factual statement is that the steps hitherto taken inregard to German rearmament, including the opening of exploratory conversations with the German authorities, do not constitute any finaldecision on the part of the Allied Governments (or, of course, on the partof the German Federal Government) either on the conditions for a german contribution or on the moment at which any agreed plan for raisingGerman forces should be begun.      There is, however, a commitmentamongst the North Atlantic Treaty Powers themselves to the principle ofa German contribution, and the initiation of discussions with the Germanson the basis of the Spofford compromise plan must be regarded as thefirst step in a moral commitment towards the Germans that they shall make a contribution, subject to political and military conditions still to beagreed.     It emerges also from the paper that all the steps taken up to thepresent moment have had the full concurrence of the Cabinet.3. The paper also brings out the fact that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand their Allies still retain their freedom to adjust the timing of anyfurther positive steps towards the creation of German armed forces, andthe question which now requires consideration is whether or not HisMajesty&apos;s Government should take any initiative to delay the moment atwhich a positive move forward might occur.4. There are three points in the future evolution of events whichwould, in my opinion, constitute decisive moments, the timing of whichmust be carefully considered.     These are:-(a)   the reaching of agreement with the German authorities on thepolitical and military conditions for a German contribution;
21 6(.b)     the submission by the German Federal Government to the bundestag of a request for authority to start raising-  forces on conditions agreed with the Allies;(c)     the first actual recruitment of German soldiers.A fourth point of significance would, of course, be a breakdown of theFour Power talks on Germany, but this is not at present predictable.5. Although theoretically the way would not be clear for german rearmament until the Bundestag had been approached, point (a) above would in fact constitute the moment at which the Allies would havefinally committed themselves to German rearmament.     Once they had agreed with the Germans on the political and military conditions (andtheir agreement would at once become known) the initiative would lie with the Germans, and since the latter would then ex hypothesi be anxiousto defend themselves it would be almost impossible for the North AtlanticPowers to put any further brake on the process.6. The point to the timing of which we must give attention is there-fore the conclusion of any agreement with the Germans on the politicaland military conditions of German rearmament.     The processes now inmovement towards an agreement are:-(a) the discussions which the three High Commissioners are nowholding in Bonn with the German military authorities on thescale and method by which German forces might be raised:(b) the discussions which the High Commissioners are holding withthe Germans in regard to the replacement of the occupation statute by contractual obligations:(c) the forthcoming conference in Paris to discuss the european army.No final agreement can be reached until all these three processes are complete.7. The High Commissioners, who are acting in this matter on behalfof the North Atlantic Council, are rightly regarding their discussions at(a) as a matter of urgency and are working for an agreement at the earliestpossible date.     Processes (b) and (c), however, are likely by their verynature to be delaying factors.     Other delaying factors are:-(i)     the impression given by General Eisenhower that he is not infavour of pressing forward unduly with German rearmamentuntil the integrated Atlantic force is more substantial:(ii)     the attitude of the German Federal Government itself.     Not onlyare they insisting that in order to ensure the passage of thenecessary law through the Bundestag Germany&apos;s relations withthe Allies must be placed on a contractual basis and the futureGerman forces given genuine equality of status with other national contingents, but they also state (as recorded in themost recent report of the High Commissioners to the Councilof Deputies) that it will be necessary &quot;to convince the Germanpeople that the Allied forces in Germany have been substantiallystrengthened&quot;.
8, These delaying factors will almost certainly ensure that thepoint of decision to which I have referred cannot be reached until afterthe possibilities of a Four-Power conference have been finally exploredor until the conference has succeeded or failed.     It might be therefore that we can rely on these factors and taker; no positive action to delay the process.9. On the other hand, the Cabinet may feel that this is not sureenough and that we should make known to the United States Governmentour anxiety in regard to the timing of the next positive step forward.     Inthat event, I would suggest that H.M, Ambassador in Washington be instructed to approach the United States Secretary of State with a view to taking stock of the situation, basing himself perhaps on the views expressedby General Eisenhower,     In parallel with such action it might be necessaryto inform the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Germany that he neednot regard the conclusion of the FTIgh Commissioners&apos; discussions with the&quot;Germans as a matter of urgency but should rather seek to spin them out.K.G.Y.Foreign Office, S.W.1,7TH FEBRUARY, 1951.
ANNEX    -The Position of His Majesty*s Government in regard to german RearmamentThis paper is an attempt to set out the precise extentto which His Majesty&apos;s Government are committed in the matterof a German contribution to Western defence and to show themanner in which the Cabinet have been consulted and have given their approval at each stage of the process.2. The question of German rearmament first became a majorinternational issue at the New York meetings in September 1950.On the eve of those meetings President Truman announced theintention of the United States Government to work for thecreation in Europe of an Integrated Defence Force under a supreme Commander, to which additional United States divisions would be contributed.    Prom that moment the story falls intofour stages&quot;: -(a) The discussions during the New York meetings,where the French declined to accept the principleof the German contribution.(b) The further unsuccessful attempts,  culminating inthe meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty.DefenceCommittee in Washington at the end of October, tobring the French into line.(c) The preparation by the North Atlantic CouncilDeputies and Military Committee at the beginningof December of what is known as the &quot;Spofford* compromise&quot;.(d) The acceptance of the Spofford plan by the north atlantic Council at the Brussels meeting in&quot;December and the instructions given to three high commissioners in Germany to start exploratory conversations with the Germans on this basis.3* The French proposal for a European Army v/as made inthe interval between stages (a) and (b).ho The following paragraphs deal with the matter on thebasis of the papers submitted tc the Cabinet and of the cabinet conclusions.The New York Discussions5* The discussions in New York between the United Kingdom,United States and French Foreign Ministers and in the north atlantic Council were reported to the Cabinet in the Secretaryof State&apos;s memorandum CP.(50) 223.    As stated in that paper,Mr. Acheson&apos;s thesis was that,  though the United States intendedto send further substantial bodies of troops to Europe to form part of an Integrated Force under a Supreme Commander, theavailable Allied forces would still be insufficient for thedefence of Europe.    Moreover, if Europe was to be saved fromoccupation by an aggressor, she must, be defended in Germany.For these two reasons it was essential to make use of Germanresources, and this could only be done with safety by the incorporation of German units in the Integrated Force.    Onlythus could the defence of Europe be assured without a revival of German militarism.
2196. &apos; CP. (50)  223 went on to describe how the Secretary ofState, both on his own account and in view of the. Frenchhesitations, had felt that&apos;considerable caution was required.He had explained to his colleagues in New York that in his view the first essential steps were to proceed with the organi-sation of the Integrated Defence Force and at the same time tobuild up the German police;    the question of German participation in the Integrated Force came second, and we should test outGerman opinion on this subject before taking any final decision.This practical approach had not satisfied the Americans and theSecretary of State, after obtaining the concurrence of the Cabinet(CM. (50)  59th. Conclusions, Minute l), had accepted the principleof German participation in the Integrated Force.    In doing so he had made it clear that the first step must be the organi-sation of the Integrated Force itself &quot;so that a position of strength was established on the Continent before the german forces were brought in&quot;.7. The French, however, had not been persuaded in new york to accept the principle of German participation, and as aresult the Americans had refused to give their final agreement to the formation of an Integrated Force.    This refusal wasreflected in the&quot; Resolution adopted by the North Atlantic Councilon that occasion (attached as an annex to CP.(50)  223)? which contained the sentence:-&quot;Since in the view of many of the Ministers the properand early solution of this problem /i. e. German parti-cipation/ is intimately connected with the successfulimplementation of the plan outlined above, that plan is not finalised .at this time.&quot;8. The Cabinet took note of the Secretary of State&apos;smemorandum CP.(50)  223 at their meeting on 9th October(&quot;CM. (50) 63rd Conclusions, Minute 3) and:-&quot;agreed that further pressure should be brought tobear on the French Government to accept in principle the incorporation of German army units in an integrated Force for the defence of Europe&quot;.North Atlantic Defence Committee Meeting in Washington on 28th October, 19509. The next stage culminated in the meeting in Washington&apos;of the North Atlantic Treaty Defence Ministers on 28th October.Immediately before this meeting assembled, the French producedtheir plan for a European Army, which was briefly discussed by the Cabinet on 30th October (CM. (50) 69th Conclusions,Minute l).    The provisional view of the Cabinet was that if theFrench   were* able to persuade other continental Powers ofY/estern Europe to join them in forming a European Army on thebasis proposed, the United Kingdom Government need not raise objection to it, though they would be unwilling to join in promoting it.    Our belief at that time was that the french proposal was largely a manoeuvre to delay decisions on german rearmament or to mitigate its effect on French public opinion.The discussions of the North ^atlantic Defence Committee were seriously confused by this French initiative and no agreement was reached,  the ijroblem being referred back to the Deputiesand the Military Committee, who were asked to seek a solutionof the political and military problems involved.The Snofford Compromise10. There then ensued a series of negotiations in the north atlantic Council Deputies and the Military Committee which resulted, early in December, in reports by both of these bodies which are collectively known as &quot;the Spofford compromise&quot;.    The
Secretary of State gave the Cabinet on 11th December(CM.(5*0)  8hth Conclusions, Minute. 3) a preliminary  -warning&apos; that this plan would shortly come up for consideration,and it may be well to quote the following passage from theConclusions:-&quot;In further discussion the point was made thatthe timing of any announcement of German rearmamentwould have to be considered in relation to theproposal for a meeting of the Council of foreign ministers.    The reaction of public opinion in western Germany would have to be considered.    Evenif the anxieties of the French could be overcome,it was by no means clear that the creationof German military forces would be welcomed in western Germany.&quot;&apos;11. The Secretary of State&apos;s memorandum to the Cabinet of12th December (CP. (50)  311)  set out at considerable lengththe position reached at that point and contained a s umma ry,prepared in the Foreign Office, of the two reports comprising the &quot;Spofford compromise&quot;.    The x^per described how HisMajesty&apos;s Government were already committed vis-a-vis theother North Atlantic Treaty Governments to the principle of aGerman contribution to Western defence on the understanding thatit formed a necessary part of a broad plan in which the americans would nominate a Supreme Commander for the IntegratedForce and undertake to send substantial reinforcements to Europeduring 1951*    It described the delays caused by Frenchreluctance and the deterioration in the situation which had inthe meantime occurred as a result of events in Korea.    Thegeneral thesis of the Secretary of State&apos;s paper was that thesituation had changed since we had accepted the principle at new York and that there were now two practical dangers ofwhich we must take account:-* (a) The first was the risk of a Soviet reaction to any&quot;public and irrevocable decision to rearm Germany&quot;.,The Secretary of State explained that he and theMinister of Defence had put their doubts on thispoint to the Prime Minister while the latter wasin Washington, in case he should feel able in thecourse of his talks with President Truman toexpress them in strict confidence.    The PrimeMinister had decided  that it would be wrong to doso, in view of the satisfactory declarationswhich he had received from the President regardingthe importance still attached by the UnitedStates to the defence of Europe, their intentionto nominate General Eisenhower as Supreme Commanderas soon as the Spofford plan was approved andtheir proposal to send National Guard reinforcements to Europe.    Any sign on our part of drawing backwould,  in the Prime Minister&apos;s view, have beenfatal to the Washington talks and to the renewedAnglo-American partnership which seemed to bedeveloping.(b)    The second was the risk th t if a cut and dried planbased on the &quot;Spofford compromise&quot; were put to theGermans formally they were very likely to refuseit.    A warning to this effect had already been: - put out by the German Chancellor.    For this reason the Secretary of State suggested that we should seek to secure some delay in the formal approach to the German Federal Government, without howeverputting the Americans off the immediate appointmentof a Supreme Commander.   He proposed to urge that before the proposals were put to the German Governmentformally,  the High Commissioners should holdinformal private discussions with Dr. Adenauerin order to ascertain.his views.
99 ilit it)12. The annex to C.P.(5C) 311,  summarising the Spofford &apos;plan, brought out clearly once again the.fact that though aGerman contribution- was recognised as being essential for thedefence of Europe, including Western Germany, as far to theEast as possible, final conclusions on the political framework within which the German contribution should be made could notbe reached until the French had either succeeded or failed over their. European. Army, proposals.    The summary contained thefollowing passage, which is of importance in that it describes the plan which the Cabinet authorised the Foreign Secretary toaccept:-&quot;it-.    While work proceeds towards the solution of thepolitical aspects of the problem, however, certainsteps, upon which there already exists a large measureof agreement, can and must be taken immediately.    Forthis purpose there must be a transitional period topermit:-(l)    the essential -preliminary work on the military organisation to be initiated immediately;(2).   the recruitment of German man-power, the formationof combat-worthy German units and the productionof material under provisional arrangementspending development of a more permanent system;and(3)    the consideration of the broader political problems to be undertaken concurrently but free from the pressure attendant upon the initiation ofmilitary measures,...&quot;13* The summary also recorded the recommendation of the deputies &quot;that the Occupying Powers be invited by the partiesto the North Atlantic Treaty to discuss with the German federal government the .question of German participation in the defenceof Western Europe&quot; on the basis set out in the plan.lk* The Cabinet considered this paper on li+th December(CM. (50)  86-feh Conclusions, Minute 4) and the following wereits conclusions:-&quot;The Cabinet -(l)    Reaffirmed their acceptance of the principle thatGermany should be enabled to contribute to thedefence of Western Europe;    and authorised theForeign Secretary to accept, at the forthcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Brussels,the plan for applying that principle which hadbeen evolved by the Council Deputies and theMilitary Committee.(2)    Approved the suggestions made by the foreign secretary in the discussion regarding the tacticsfor putting that plan into operation by stages,adjusted to the progress made in building up an integrated. Force for the defence of western europe under an American Supreme Commander.(3) Authorised the Secretary of State for Common-wealth&apos; Relations to inform other commonwealth governments.....&quot;
15. As regards conclusion (2) above, the Secretary of State&apos;suggestions regarding tactics may be read in the introductorypassages of CM.(50) 86th Conclusions, Minute 3*    They were broadly.speaking on the lines of his own paper as already described.    He said that if the Spofford plan were endorsed bythe North Atlantic Council he would pro-pose that the GermanGovernment * should at this stage be informed merely that the plan had been adopted bat should not be asked either to accept or to reject it.    Thus, if a meeting of the Council of Foreign ministers were arranged, the Western Powers would be able to discuss the demilitarisation of Germany &quot;without having taken any irrevocablestep towards the rearming of Western Germany&quot;.    &quot;While he wouldnot go back on his acceptance of the principle of german participation in the defence of Western Europe, he would urge that discretion should be used in timing the implementation ofthat principle&quot;.The Brussels Meetings16. The Secretary of State accordingly went to the BrusselsMeeting of the North Atlantic Council with the Cabinet&apos;s authorityto agree to the Spofford compromise plan.    The plan was in factadopted without much difficulty by the Council.    In the event,it was not necessary for the Secretary of State to take the leadin advocating caution in regard to the approach to the Germans,Mr. Acheson no less than the other Foreign Ministers had evi-dently realised that too much speed and formality might leadto a rejection by the German Federal Government of the planworked out by the Deputies.    Accordingly there was general -though tacit - recognition at the Brussels meetings that lessprominence should be given to the question of German participationand that the North Atlantic Treaty Powers should concentrate on setting up the Integrated Force under General Eisenhoweras Supreme Commander and in building up Allied strength.This emphasis was reflected in the communique,  so that in effect the decisions of the Brussels meetings did not appear to con-stitute an &quot;irrevocable&quot; new step towards German rearmament.17. By approving the Deputies&apos;  and Military CommitteeTsreports the Council automatically adopted recommendation No. 1in the former report which reads:-&quot;1.      The Occupying Powers be invited by the partiesto the North Atlantic Treaty to discuss with the german federal Government the question of German participation in the defence of Western Europe along the lines setforth in the Military Committee&apos;s report and in thepresent document, &quot;Accordingly, the Foreign Ministers of the three Occupying Powersmet on the 19th December and&quot;agreed that the decisions of the North Atlantic Councilon German participation in European defence should be; explained orally to the German Federal Chancellor bythe High Commissioners with an indication that they were ready to discuss the matter v/ith him further, but withouthanding- him any document and without conveying theimpression that he was expected to take hasty decisions,&quot;The three High Commissioners were present at this meeting andwere told that they should regard this decision and the reportsof the Deputies and the Military Committee, of which they hadreceived copies., as their terms of reference for the discussions with the&apos; Germans,The High Commissioners&apos; Exploratory Discussions with the Germans18, It is on the above basis that the three High Commissionershave- been holding informal conversations with the German federal authorities in Bonn.    It will be clear that the very fact of the
three High Commissioners having entered into the conversations with the Germans on this basis constituted a step towardscommitment by the Allied Governments in the matter of german rearmament, . The commitment.of His Majestyfs Government upto that point had been a commitment towards other members of theNorth Atlantic Treaty though the widespread publicity which had attended the deliberations and disagreements of the north atlantic Treaty Powers on the subject had of course alreadyput the Germans in a strong bargaining position.    Now, however,  therewas a certain moral commitment towards the Germans in that they hadbeen informed of the agreement reached by the North AtlanticGovernments that there should be a German contribution and hadbeen asked to give their views as to&apos; how it should be organised.19. The conversations in Bonn fall into two parts.    Thefirst concerns the constitutional and political changes whichwould become necessary in the relationship of the Allied powers with Germany by reason of her association with Western defence.The three High&apos;Commissioners were authorised by the foreign ministers at Brussels to explore this matter with the german authorities on the basis that the Occupying Powers v/ould beprepared to consider the replacement of the Occupation regimeby contractual arrangements over as wide a field as possiblejwhile maintaining their Ultimate supreme authority.    The evolution of our relationship with Germany along these lines will be desirableirrespecti/e of the decisions on defence, as part of the declared policy of bringing Germany by degrees nearer to a state of fulland equal partnership in Western Europe.    It will be a longprocess, and the exploratory discussions with the Germans are still at an early stage.20. The second part, which is being conducted by the deputiesof the&quot;High Commissioners with Herr Blank and former GeneralsSpiedel and Heusinger,  constitutes an.exploratory study of thescale and method by which German units would be raised and maintained once political agreement had been reached to raisethem.21. These latter conversations, being of an exploratorycharacter and linked, as explained above, with the broader poli-tical questions which have not yet been solved (i.e. possiblereplacement of the Occupation Statute by &quot;contractual&quot; obli-gations;    outccme of the European Army conference;    and the general problem of Germany&apos;s relationship with N.A.T.O.), cannot them-selves extend  the formal commitments of the Allied Governmentstowards Germany and cannot lead to any definite decisions as to either the scale or the timing of the German contribution.    their purpose is to v/ork out the technical and organizational principles   -on which the German force would be raised once political agreementwith the Germans were reached.    The Foreign Ministers of the threeOccupying Powers undertook at the Brussels meeting of the north atlantic Council not to allow the discussions to go beyond theprinciples and conditions laid down in the Spofford plan -without reference back to the Council,    The chief of these conditions are that the German contribution must not exceed one-fifth of theAllied forces available to the Supreme Commander and that they shallbe organised in units not greater than brigade groups.22.-        It is on the timing of these steps that some uncertaintyarises.    The High Commissioners, basing themselves on the docu-ments comprising the &quot;Spofford compr^mise&quot;, rightly consider ittheir duty to reach conclusions with the Germans&apos;as quickly aspossible.    They are working to bring into operation the transitional period&quot; referred to .in paragraph 12 above, forwhich &quot;certain stepss,.can and must be taken immediately&quot;,including the &quot;essential preliminary work on the military.organi-sation to be initiated immediately&quot; and &quot;the recruitment ofGerman man-power, the formation of combat-worthy German units and the-production of material under provisional - arrangements.&quot;
(these quotations are from the summary of the Spoffordplan which was annexed to C.P.(50) 311).    This sense of speed in the minds of the High Commissioners is entirely justified by the decisions of the Worth atlantic council to which His Majesty&apos;s Government were parties,having regard to the limited purpose and terms of reference of the High Commissioners&apos;  talks.23. There remains, however, the consideration,expressed by the Cabinet in almost every discussion ofthis topic and by the Secretary of State and other foreign ministers at the North Atlantic Council meeting, that cautionmust be exercised in the timing of the actual raising ofGerman forces.    It has not always been easy to defineprecisely what is the step to which this caution should beapplied.    At first it was thought that a decision inprinciple by the Atlantic Powers in favour of a german contribution would constitute &quot;the irrevocable step towardsGerman rearmament&quot; which might be supposed to bring about a soviet reaction.   When this point had been passed it seemed that an approach to the Germans would be the dangerous moment.Now that this approach has been made, but in an informal andexploratory manner, the next landmark may be&apos; the announcementof agreement with the Germans on the political andmilitary conditions to be observed.    Alternatively, it mightbe held that the real point of danger would be the moment when the German Government go to the Bundestag for authority to begin recruiting, or, if not that, themoment when they actually put men into uniform in organisedunits,    A failure of the Four-Power talks with the russians would also, of course, be a decisive moment.2k* His Majesty&apos;s Government and their Allies stillretain their freedom to adjust the timing of future stepsforward.    So long as the discussions in Bonn are continued on a tripartite basis, nothing can result beyond a report back to.the North Atlantic Treaty Powers that agreement has been reached on the military conditions of a german contribution.    There will still remain to be settled thepolitical implications, the effect on the occupation statute, the European Army, etc.    From the point of view,therefore,  of the Four Power talks with the Soviet Union,the Allied Governments are still in the position of not having taken an &quot;irrevocable step&quot; in the creation ofGerman armed forces,  and theoretically they could abandon the whole plan in return for a peace settlement.with Russia.Conclusions25. The conclusions which may be drawn from the abovearei.-(a) that each step taken hitherto has been fullyendorsed by Cabinet decisions;(b) j   that the timing of further steps forward can stillbe regulated at the will of- the North atlantic treaty Powers;(c) that the need for caution in the timing of thesesteps has been recognised implicitly by the north atlantic Treaty Governments (though not all ofthem for the same reasons), and more specificallyby General Eisenhower, who has made it clear thathe regards the build-up of Allied strength as a first-call; -
(ci)        that the exploratory discussions now in processin Bonn cannot,  in themselves,&apos; result in any-new commitment by His Majesty1s Government orin any final decisions.Foreign Office, S.W.1.,7th February, 1951*
