this document is the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s government-.-:-,--*ePrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1951SECRET Copy No.CP. (51) 9llth January, 1951CABINETTHE FUTURE OF THE CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT and national ARBITRATION ORDER, 1940Memorandum by the Attorney-general  should like to put before my colleagues my views on some of the questions raised by the Minister of Labour in his memorandum (CP. (51) 8) on the future ofthe Conditions of Employment and National Arbitration Order.2. So far as concerns paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Ministers paper, dealing with difficulties of interpretation and procedure in connection with the existing Order,I make the following comments:  (i) There can I think be no doubt that although the Minister may, for good cause, postpone the reference to the National Arbitration Tribunalbeyond the normal period of 21 days provided for in the Order, theprohibition against strike or lockout action lapses at the end of the 21-day period if no reference has been made by then. Manifestly the right* to take strike or lockout action could hardly be delayed indefinitely, butif, to take the case put by the Minister, there is &quot; good reason to believethat a few more days&apos; discussion will result in a settlement by agree-ment &quot; the mere fact that a reference has not been made within the 21days and that, therefore, the prohibition against strike or lockout action has lapsed, would not necessarily result in a strike or lockout occurring.(ii) I am a little surprised at the statement that it has hitherto been assumed that in the event of a failure to reach a settlement the Minister was bound to refer to the Tribunal . . . . &quot; and that he would not, in general,welcome a discretion.&quot; This matter was, I think, first brought to mynotice in connection with a case where the Minister had in fact exerciseda discretion to refuse to refer a dispute connected with the employmentof non-Union labour by the British Overseas Airways Corporation andthe point has also arisen in regard to his refusal to refer a dispute con-cerning Kemsley Newspapers, and another between Town Clerks andtheir employing authorities. I had always understood that the Ministerdesired to retain a discretion and I have, on this understanding, advisedhim that it is possible to argue that the Order gives him the right so todo although I think this doubtful. If the Minister does not desire toretain a discretion the action for a mandamus against him in theKemsley Newspaper case should not be resisted.(iii) It is clear that the Order applies to all trade disputes whether supportedby a Trade Union or not. Thus the Order prohibits all strike or lock-out action, official or unofficial. It would, I should have thought, be quite intolerable to prohibit unofficial strike action unless those who desired to strike had, as an alternative right, recourse to the national arbitration Tribunal. The Minister would not, I think, be exercisinghis discretion properly (assuming he has a discretion at all) if he were tomake it a rule not to refer &quot; unofficial &quot; disputes.(iv) The Attorney-General has always had a responsibility (concurrently withthe Minister of Labour) for enforcing the Order and this he must retain:39938
the occasional device of giving a Minister or someone else an exclusivepower to prosecute is recognised to be undesirable. I have on many occasions refrained from prosecuting in deference to the view of mycolleagues that prosecution would prejudice an expected settlement by negotiation, and sometimes for technical reasons. I do not recall everhaving refrained from prosecuting simply on account of the numbers involved.3. I have on previous occasions (cf. CP. (50) 224; CP. (50) 305) indicated my own view about those aspects of the present system which concern the Law Officers.I do not like the present Order and if the criminal law is to be invoked at all I would prefer to see either a completely revised system of national arbitration capable of regular enforcement or possibly, but no doubt less efficaciously, a law delaying strike action either by the necessity of giving notice terminating the contract of employ-ment (as under the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875) or by a secretpostal ballot. But even so, the criminal law as a method of preventing strikes willremain at best an uncertain, uneven, and risky weapon. Its use may all too easilybring about the opposite to the desired result; there may be a widespread extensionof the strike, those prosecuted tend to be represented as martyrs and antagonismis caused against the law and the Police.4. Moreover, the implications of the present Order are not always understood,and it is sometimes considered that, in deciding whether or not to prosecute, theLaw Officers should have regard to considerations to which (however attractive theymay be politically) the Law Officers must in truth always close their eyes. Thus thefact that a prosecution in relation to a strike arising out of a refusal of trade unionists to work alongside non-Unionists might &quot; cause concern in Trade Unioncircles &quot; (CM. (50) 83rd Conclusions, Minute 9) is one which, as the Lord Chancellorpointed out, I am constitutionally bound to ignore. So also the suggestion that before prosecuting for alleged intimidation &quot; I would doubtless satisfy myself thatthe action had not been with the knowledge and approval of the Trade Union &quot;(CM. (50) 84th Conclusions, Minute 1) since action which is otherwise a breach ofthe criminal law is not the less so because approved by a Trade Union. Equallymisconceived is the argument recorded in the same minute that there wouldbe &quot;misunderstanding if criminal proceedings were taken in respect of a dispute which had already been referred to arbitration &quot; since the very objectof the Order is to prohibit strike action whilst matters are the subject of arbitration and the only sanction for the system of compulsory arbitration which the Orderestablishes is that of criminal prosecution.5. But while the administration of the Order is a cause of embarrassment tome with my colleagues, which I would gladly see removed, I realise that the revocation of the Order would not only put an end to a system of arbitration whichhas been generally most useful, but might also be politically unwise at the presenttime. The danger of strike action being used for political or subversive ends has,I suppose, much increased since we repealed the Trades Disputes Act 1927 fiveyears ago. It is, however, in practice most difficult to obtain evidence that a strikeis a seditious conspiracy, and if the present Order were repealed there would, apartfrom the limited under the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act1875, be no provision in the criminal law effective to prohibit strikes in aid ofpolitical objectives. Whether requested or not by one side or the other of industry,I think it would be difficult now to revoke the Order completely.6.   As for amendment of the Order, my comments on the Ministers proposals are as follows:  (i) It seems to me that it would be quite impossible, whilst maintaining thesystem of compulsory arbitration, to revoke the prohibition against strike or lockout action. This would in effect make the order quiteinoperative, since the sanction making arbitration compulsory is thatstrike or lockout action in disregard of the arbitration machinery isillegal. The prohibition is, as a matter of law, an essential feature ofthe Order.... (ii) The penalty could be varied so as to rest on a fine only.   As an alternative,it might be provided that a strike or lockout in breach of the order should render each striker or employer liable to a daily penalty of  1, so long as the strike continued, recoverable at the suit of the individual&apos;   employer against each striker, or by each locked out worker against

This would take the matter outsidethe sphere of the criminal law but would, I dare say, not be appreciatedby the employers, who much prefer the opprobrium for enforcementaction to lie on the shoulders of the Government or the Attorney-General ! It is, in any event, for the Cabinet to consider whether, atthe present juncture, an amendment of the penalties is politically wise.(iii) I would be strongly opposed to the suggestion that only establishedorganisations could report disputes. If the prohibition against strike action were left as it is, this would impose an intolerable limitation onthe right of individuals to strike. If, on the other hand, the prohibitionwere removed, this would encourage unofficial strikes which are exactly the ones against which the Order should be directed.(iv) I have no comment on the suggested exclusion of disputes relating torecognition of non-Unionism. The recent strike in the docks was an example of such a strike, although it related to a recognition disputeoutside the United Kingdom and thus was not within the scope of theOrder. In general, as the law now stands, such disputes are clearlywithin the Order, although it is said that the National arbitration tribunal does not consider that it can usefully decide them.7. If the matter had not been complicated by the present facts of the inter-national situation which may make any action difficult, I would myself havesuggested that permanent legislation should be undertaken establishing a systemof national arbitration on a peace-time basis, rather than as a hangover of war-timeregulations, which, while it prohibited strike or lockout action until the arbitrationmachinery had run its course (not absolutely as at present), made the penalty a civilone, recoverable summarily at the suit of the employers or workmen, with a right inthe employers or workmen and perhaps also in the Attorney-General to go to theCourt and secure an injunction against strike or lockout action in advance of the Arbitrator^ award if (and, in the case of action by the Attorney-General, only if)it was in the interest of the community generally that such an injunction be granted.This power in the Attorney-General to apply for an injunction would not be wholly^new. It probably exists already but is attended by such difficulties and doubtsthat it has fallen into desuetude.8. I hope that the points made in paragraph 3 will be stressed in any dis-cussions which the Minister of Labour has with the Joint Consultative Committeeof the National Joint Advisory Council, and that it will be pointed out that whilst the Order remains as it is I cannot escape my duty to enforce it.H. w. s.
