THIS DOCUMENT IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF HIS   BRITANNIC MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1951CONFIDENTIALCP. (51) 5720th February, 1951CABINETUNITED NATIONS: COVENANT ON HUMAN RIGHTSMemorandum by the Minister of StateMy colleagues may be interested to learn the present position in connexionwith the United Nations first draft covenant on Human Rights.2. Since December 1948, when the General Assembly of the United Nationsadopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the sessions of the united nations Commission on Human Rights have been devoted to drafting an Inter-national Covenant designed to ensure the observation of fundamental rightswithin the territories of signatories. We have been among the leading proponentsof a binding Covenant on the ground that only thus could these rights be effectivelyguaranteed.3. There has, however, been great debate in the United Nations on what rightsshould be included in the Covenant and no substantial measure of agreement hasbeen reached. The latest stage in the discussion was the adoption by the general assembly on 4th December last of two Resolutions. The first of these asked theEconomic and Social Council to request the Human Rights Commission to recon-sider the inclusion of economic, social and cultural rights, and the right to nationalself-determination, and to examine procedures for the receipt of individual petitions.In the second the Human Rights Commission was asked to provide for automaticextension of the Covenant on signature to metropolitan and colonial territoriesalike. These suggestions all run counter to our own recommendations. Theprospect of the Human Rights Commission succeeding in drafting a Covenant satis-factory to us or to many other members of the United Nations is thus not very good.4. Before the Human Rights Commission meets the Cabinet will be asked fordirections on these matters. Meanwhile, since the subject is to come up at the twelfth Session of the Economic and Social Council Ministers will wish to know that the United Nations Secretariat expects that the Council will merely pass onthe Assembly&apos;s resolutions to the Human Rights Commission without discussingtheir substance. This is satisfactory. The United Kingdom Delegation have been instructed if necessary to oppose any discussion of substance and to avoid committing His Majesty&apos;s Government, even by implication, to the inclusion of rights or methods of enforcement other than those we have already accepted.5. The actions of the Delegation at Santiago should therefore not prejudiceany course which Ministers may later decide to adopt at the next Session of the human Rights Commission.K. G.
