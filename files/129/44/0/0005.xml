this  document  is the   property   of his  britannic majestvs   governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1951CONFIDENTIALCP. (51) 56th January, 1951.CABINETTHE CONDITIONS OF BRITISH TROOPS IN KOREAMemorandum by the Minister of defence at the meeting of the Cabinet held on 16th November (CM. (50) 74th Con-clusions, Minute 2 (2)) I was invited to consider, in consultation with the service ministers and, if necessary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, whether further steps should be taken to ensure that the conditions of British troops in Korea during theforthcoming winter would be such as to give no reasonable grounds for public anxiety or criticism. I have reviewed the position with my Service colleagues and I now present this interim report.2. Public anxiety about the conditions of our troops in Korea centred chieflyOn alleged deficiences of winter clothing, particularly as regards the 27th Brigade.This Brigade was originally intended to be relieved by the 29th Brigade Group andno arrangement was therefore made in the first instance to supply it with specialwinter clothing. The men had, of course, serge battledress and greatcoats; nottropical clothing. When, however, it was decided that the Brigade should remainin Korea the United States authorities were asked to help with the supply of winterclothing. Air Vice-Marshal Bouchier reported on 20th November that winterclothing had been flown up to the Brigade, that our troops were at least as wellequipped as the average American Unit fighting alongside them and that there hadbeen no complaints.Quite apart from clothing supplies which the Brigade received from the americans, they would also have been able to draw on the maintenance stores ofthe 29th Brigade Group, which arrived in Korea early in October, and are amplefor their immediate needs.3. The 29th Brigade Group sailed from this country completely equipped withwinter clothing of British type.4. The Royal Navy and R.A.F. have had no particular clothing problem sinceNorth China has always been provided for as a cold weather station, and theR.A.F. is based on Japan, where winter conditions are not particularly rigorous;special electrically-heated flying clothing has been sent out by air for use by aircrewoperating further north. The Royal Marine Commando Brigade are being supplied by the United States Marine Corps.5. There were reports in the Press before Christmas that the troops in Koreawould have to subscribe large sums to cover the cost of their Christmas dinners.The facts are that the arrangements for Christmas fare in Korea, subject to the exigencies of the service, were similar to those which have been made annually formen serving abroad since 1940; they were at least as good as have ever been madefor troops on active service in the field. In addition to the normal free issue, theusual Christmas extras, such as Christmas pudding, turkey, &amp;c, was available at theN.A.A.F.I. and was purchased out of the Christmas grant of 9d. for each man and out of any rebate or other Unit funds available. This, as I have said, is the normalarrangement.39896Copy No.   o
6. As regards amenities in general, the 27th Brigade have no N.A.A.F.I.canteens with them, but make use of Australian canteen facilities. The 29thBrigade Group has its own N.A.A.F.I. unit, which includes six mobile canteens.From these canteens the troops can buy the normal range of N.A.A.F.I. goods,including cigarettes at cheap prices; they also receive a free issue of 50 cigarettes aweek. The Naval Commander-in-Chief has expressed himself as fully satisfied withN.A.A.F.I. arrangements for his ships&apos; companies. Special arrangements have beenmade by the War Office to allow private donors and service organisations to sendwireless sets, newspapers, books, &amp;c, and woollen comforts, to units and individuals..The Command in Korea have been asked whether they need any canteens fromvoluntary organisations affiliated to the Council of Voluntary Welfare Work, whohave been warned that they may be asked to take on this commitment.7. There have been suggestions in Parliament that postal arrangements forthe troops are not completely satisfactory. As the Cabinet are aware, the Post-master-General arranged an air mail service for one Christmas parcel per man to besent free of postage. As another special concession Forces lightweight letters canbe sent free from Korea to the United Kingdom, and the extension of postalconcessions as between Korea and Hong Kong and Singapore, where some of themen&apos;s families are, is being considered. Allegations of delay in the mail service to Korea are now being investigated.8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer announced on 5th December that he was considering arrangements to enable small packages of cigarettes and tobacco to be exported duty free to our troops in Korea. I understand that he is sympathetic inprinciple but that there are administrative difficulties which have not yet been completely solved. It is, however, important to avoid further delay.9. The Commander, British Element, Korean Base, was instructed before he left for Korea to let the War Office know as soon as possible what additionalcomforts and amenities were required for the troops, and towards the end ofNovember a signal was sent to Korea asking for early information as to require-ments. The only request that has so far been received is for certain additionalN.A.A.F.I. canteen units which have now been formed and are on their way toKorea.10. The general conclusion of my Service colleagues and myself is that present arrangements for the welfare and comfort of the forces operating in Korea are satisfactory and that no special steps are needed to improve them at the moment.We shall, of course, keep ourselves informed on the position.E. S.Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1,5 th January, 1951.
