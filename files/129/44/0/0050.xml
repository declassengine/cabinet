THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY   OF HIS   BRITANNIC  MA.IESTVS   GOVERNMENT 253Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1951SECRET Copy no cp. (51) 50\2th February, 1951CABINET.31NATIONALISATION OF PUBLIC WATER SUPPLIES: ENGLAND ANDWALESMemorandum by the Minister of Local Government and PlanningI have followed closely the previous discussions in the Cabinet on thissubject and. I am much impressed with the value of the latest proposals submittedby my predecessor (CP. (51) 13). These give local authorities a major role in theadministration of water supplies, while securing to the central department thenecessary control over the sources of water supply and over their allocation anddistribution.2. The scheme commends itself to me particularly because of the substantialbenefit to rural communities, as illustrated in the Annex to my predecessor^ Paper,which can be achieved with only very small increase in cost to urban communities.But, if this is to be done, all waterworks must vest in the central department since this is the only way to spread the cost of these works over the whole country.3. I would like, before settling details, to discuss this question with the associations of local authorities and to indicate to them the Government^ intentionto proceed along the lines referred to in my predecessor^ paper.This would mean that (1) All private water companies would be nationalised;(2) All waterworks would vest in the Minister of Local Government and planning, who would be responsible for the provision of new supplies;(3) Between 50 and 60 area authorities, comprised of local authority repre-sentatives, would administer the scheme in their areas. They would contribute to the Ministers costs according to their water consumption and each area authority would meet their contribution to this cost andtheir own running expenses by an equal charge on all domestic waterconsumers in their area, with charges to industrial consumers based on consumption.4.   I ask my colleagues to agree to my entering on these discussions.H. D.Ministry of Local Government and Planning, S.W. 1,12th February, 1951.40112
