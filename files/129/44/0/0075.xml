(THIS-D-OCUMENT IS THE-PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY-IS-GOVERNMEN-T-]confidential cp. (51) 758TH MARCH, 1951COPY NO.   3 ICABINETSALARIES AND CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT OF TOWN CLERKSMemorandum by Minister of Labour and National Service.In CP. (50) 316 my predecessor referred to the disputes which hadbeen reported to him on behalf of the Society of Town Clerks under theConditions of Employment and National Arbitration Order, 1940, and indicated the difficulties raised by these reports.   The legal aspects of the matter were also dealt with by the Attorney-General in C. P. (50) 321.2. My colleagues will recall that when these papers were consideredby the Cabinet on 2nd January, 1951 (CM. (51) 1st Conclusions, Minute 6), thegeneral view was that no further action should be taken in the matter until the outcome was known of the Kemsley Newspapers case (in which certain membersof the National Union of Journalists are applying to the High Court for an. order ofmandamus to compel me to refer to the National Arbitration Tribunal anal leged dispute reported by them). \3. It was originally contemplated that the defence in the KemsleyNewspapers case might be based on the Attorney-General&apos;s view that I probably have discretion whether or not to refer disputes to the National ArbitrationTribunals   My predecessor felt, however - and I agree - that to claim suchdiscretion could only lead to embarrassment and difficulties in the administratorof the Order;  and the Attorney-General has therefore accepted the view that myaction in the Kemsley case (which has not yet come before the High Court) shouldbe defended solely on the ground that no trade dispute as defined in the order was in fact ever reported.   Accordingly, the outcome of the Kemsley casecan have no direct bearing on the Town Clerks&apos; disputes and there is now nological reason for making the action to be taken in the one dependent upon theresult of the other.4. Most of the Town Clerks&apos; disputes were reported to my department as long ago as October, 1950.   The Society of Town Clerks have recentlybeen pressing me to announce my decision, and there is little doubt that,in the absence of an early announcement that the cases are to be referred tothe National Arbitration Tribunal, the Society will apply for an order ofmandamus against me.   I have promised that I will endeavour to give adefinite decision next week whether or not to refer the disputes to the Tribunal,,5. It will be recalled that the recommendations of the Joint negotiating committee have aroused a good deal of opposition,,   I have much sympathy with this opposition, and in particular with the view that the machinery of compulsory arbitration ought not to be used to coerce elected bodies such as local Authorities.   At the same time, the Order in its present form placesLocal Authorities in exactly the same position as any other employer and it ison that basis that the present question must be considered.
A.B.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S. W. 1. ,8TH MARCH, 1951.6, As mentioned above, it has been decided in the Kemsley Newspaperscase not to claim discretion for me to withhold the case from the national arbitration Tribunal.   The Town Clerks&apos; cases cannot therefore be with-held from the Tribunal on that ground.   If the disputes are to be withheld,it will have to be on the ground that they are not trade disputes as defined in the Order.7. The Attorney-General has already advised that the disputes are&quot;almost certainly&quot; within that definition.   It seems to me that unless he isprepared to contend otherwise there would be no defence to a writ.   In thecircumstances, I have no alternative but to refer the cases to the national arbitration Tribunal,   Each case will, of course, have to be considered on its merits by the Tribunal and it will be open to the individual LocalAuthorities to argue that they are not bound by the terms of the recommendatiothat it is within their discretion whether or not to accept the proposed scale.
