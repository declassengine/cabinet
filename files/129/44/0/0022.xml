this  document  is the   property   of his  britannic  majesty&apos;s   governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1951SECRETCP. (51) 2223rd January, 1951CABINETSUPPLY OF NATIONAL. SERVICE MEN TO MEET THE NEEDS OFTHE FORCES   &apos;Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service. My predecessor circulated to the Defence Committee on 1st January, 1951,a memorandum on the Supply of National Service Men to meet the needs of theForces (D.O. (51) 1), a copy of which is annexed. In it he recommended that the indefinite deferment of the calling up of young agricultural workers should be discontinued forthwith, and that arrangements should be made to post to theServices, for employment on suitable duties, as many of the men placed in thelower medical categories as the Services can accept. I endorse those proposals.2. Young men in agriculture and coalmining have been granted indefinitedeferment because of the importance of these two basic industries and becausethey have been undermanned. The Agricultural Ministers admit that agriculture is no longer undermanned (CP. (51) 23). There can, therefore, no longer be anyjustification for continuing to grant indefinite deferment to young men in agricul-*   ture, particularly when there is a shortage of National Service men for the Forces.3. Since D.O. (51) 1 was circulated proposals have been made to increasethe rearmament programme. If these new proposals are agreed, the shortage ofNational Service men to the end of March 1952 will be between 50,000 and 55,000..The proposals in D.O. (51)1 therefore, which at most will produce 30,000 additionalmen, will not provide the numbers required for the Forces and additional measures will be needed.4.  As stated in D.O. (51) 1, the only possibilities are:  (1) lowering the age of call-up to 18; and(2) reduction in the number of deferments for apprentices.I agree with my predecessor that the second of these two methods would be amost retrograde step, and I, therefore, recommend-although with considerablereluctance and because there is no alternative that we should lower the age ofcall-up to 18.A.

ANNEX[D.O. (51) 11st January, 1951]cabinet defence CommitteeSUPPLY OF NATIONAL SERVICE MEN TO MEET THE NEEDS OFTHE forces memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service. At the meeting* of the Defence Committee held on 25th October last, I was invited to examine and report on the man-power implications of the proposals submitted by the Chiefs &quot;of Staff in D.O. (50) 81. This Paper deals with the questionhow we can meet the needs of the Forces for National Service men down to the endof March 1952.2. The total numbers of men expected to be available for posting as NationalService men during the current and next financial years are 167,000 and 160,000respectively. Nearly a third of these are young men, generally of 21 or over,* becoming available for call-up on expiry of deferment granted for approved appren-ticeships or studies; the remainder are young men called-up soon after registrationat about the age of 18 years 3 months.These estimates are somewhat smaller than earlier estimates. This is mainly because more young men and boys are enlisting in the Forces as Regulars before they are registered for National Service at about the age of 18 or between registra-tion and call-up. In particular, the R.A.F. engagement of 3 years&apos; whole-time service followed by 2\ years on the Reserve is at present attracting young menbetween registration and call-up at the rate of about 500 a week.3. On the most likely assumptions about the trends of Regular recruiting andre-engagements which can be made at present, the Services expect to need thefollowing total intakes of National Service men during the current and next financial years:  1950-51 1951-52Navy...............        2,000 2,000Army ............      119,000     &apos;     119,000R.A.F.............       53,000 50,000tTotal    ............      174,000 171,0004. In connection with these demands from the Services, I must make theimportant point that, when a young man about to be called-up undertakes a Regularengagement&apos;instead, this reduces the number of men available for posting to theServices as National Service men without necessarily reducing the demands of theServices for National Service men to make up the total man-power they require to fulfil their commitments.* D.O. (50) 20th Meeting, Minute 5.f This figure is based on the assumption that Regulars in the R.A.F. will, during the financialyear 1951-52, be retained for six months after the end of their Colour service. If, by 1st April, 1952,they were not being retained for any period after the end of their Colour service, this figure wouldbe increased by 5,000.40009
5.   The supply and demand position is therefore as follows:1950-511951-52Probable SupplyProbable DemandProbable Shortage167,000174,0007,0006 months&apos;retention ofR.A.F. Regularsduring 1951-52160,000171,00011,000No retentionof R.A .F.Regulars at1st April, 1952160,000176,00016,000Note.-Figures are given above for the whole of the current financial yearinstead of only for the period still to run because it is very difficult toestimate the numbers of National Service men likely to be available except on an annual basis. As the needs of the Services for National Service men have, however, up to now broadly been met, any shortage will show itself in the period yet to run.6. There are only three ways of securing a substantial increase in the numberof National Service men available for posting over the next year or two.These are:  (a) to reduce the number of deferments granted;(b) to post men of a lower medical standard than at present if the services can accept and use such men;(c) to lower the age of call-up.The advantages and disadvantages of these methods are examined in thefollowing paragraphs.Reducing deferments7. Leaving out one or two groups in which the numbers are insignificant,deferment is at present granted to young men in the following broad groups, thenumbers affected in the 1932 age-group being as shown:  GroupCoal-minersAgricultural workersMerchant Seamen ...ApprenticesStudents    ......Period for whichdeferment is granted.Indefinite   ......A pproximatenumbers affectedin an age group8,00020.0004,000&quot;Until completion of apprentice- j ^qqqqship or studies, when they fare called upJ8,000We cannot contemplate calling-up coal-miners and there would be no point&quot;in calling-up young men in the Merchant Navy to serve in the Army or R.A.F.when their place in war would be in the Merchant Navy. As regards the apprentices and students, it is true that deferment is granted, on application, to enable youngmen to complete approved apprenticeships. or studies, without interruption by national Service, irrespective of the importance in the national interest of the kindof training or studies they are pursuing. On the other hand, the arrangements for granting deferment to apprentices and students pursuing approved courses havehad an important effect, as they were intended to, in encouraging industries andprofessions to set up proper schemes of industrial and professional training. Theyhave been widely welcomed and praised in educational and industrial circles and,indeed, recently by prominent members of the Opposition in Parliament. To restrict the scope of these arrangements would, in my view, be, and would certainly be widely regarded as being, a retrograde step. It would, in fact, be by no means easy to draw the line between training and studies for which deferment would be allowedand those for which it would not, in a way which would win acceptance. Moreover,its effect would only be temporary and it would not help in the long run since, if more of these young men were called-up now, there, would, be so many the fewerto call-up on expiry of deferments in about three years time when the shortageof National Service men may well be as acute as it is now. I suggest therefore thatwe Should avoid making any attempt to limit deferments to complete approved&apos;apprenticeships or studies.
8.   The only remaining possibility is to curtail or bring to an end the existingindefinite deferment of young agricultural workers.9. The arrangement that young men in the main agricultural occupations arenot called up has been continued, on a year-to-year basis, since 1946. The regularagricultural labour force in Great Britain increased year by year from 611,000 at mid-1945 to 673,000 at mid-1949 compared with 601,000 at mid-1939. This labour force, assisted by improvements in mechanisation and efficiency, was adequate for the level of production actually undertaken. Between June 1949 and June 1950,however, the number of regular workers fell by 1.1,000 to 662,000. I understandthat, although some progress was made, the agricultural production objectives for1950 were not achieved and that, apart from making up this leeway, the programmes for 1951 and 1952 require further increases in crops and livestock.It is the view of the agricultural departments that, even after allowance has beenmade for the continued increase in output per agricultural worker which may reasonably be expected, some increase in the regular agricultural labour force willbe required if the desired level of production is to be attained. It is acknowledgedthat prospects of recruitment remain fairly good, but the 10,000 European VolunteerWorkers estimated to be still employed in agriculture are being released from controlprogressively from 1st January, 1951, onwards and some will doubtless leave theindustry as will some of the German and Ukrainian ex-prisoners of war when theyare eventually given a free choice of employment. In these circumstances, it isthe view of the agricultural departments that what would amount to about 15,000young men a year should not be taken off the farms for two years&apos; military service involving an ultimate loss to agriculture of about 30,000 young men; they alsosuggest that, in addition to the practical effect, farmers would regard the withdrawalof deferment as a withdrawal of Government support from their efforts to increasefood production which might have serious repercussions on the chance of achieving the cropping programmes which the agricultural departments are urging them toundertake.10. These are powerful arguments, but it is, nevertheless, my view that thearrangement under which all young men in agriculture are granted defermentshould now be brought to an end. The information I receive from my Regional*and Local Officers is that there is now no evidence to suggest that farmers are really short of labour. Although, &quot;as mentioned above, the regularagricultural labour force fell by 11,000 between-June 1949 and June 1950, thenumber of agricultural vacancies for men, which were notified to my Local offices and remained unfilled at the end of the four-weekly statistical periods, has been about 9 per cent, lower on average during 1950 compared with the correspondingperiod of 1949. It is true that this figure must be somewhat discounted because some farmers do not notify their vacancies to my Department though they are constantly urged to do so and if there were a serious shortage, could be expected to but the information as to the general position available to the Ministry is tha$there is no general shortage. -11. This view is confirmed by instances of the unwillingness of farmers toput themselves to any appreciable trouble to improve their labour supply position.For example, when the intention to disband the Women&apos;s Land Army was firstannounced, there was an outcry from the farmers but this soon died down whenit was suggested that the farmers themselves might set up a comparable but similarorganisation to recruit inexperienced girls from urban areas.12. Moreover, my Department receives a constant and considerable flow of letters complaining that young men are going into agriculture only in order to escape doing their national service and that there is no real need to continue the deferment of agricultural workers Its discontinuance might indeed have theimportant effect of assisting the recruitment of young men for the coal-mines.13. / accordingly recommend that the agricultural blanket should be broughtto an end forthwith that is, that young men on the farms who register for nationalservice in 1951 should be made available, if fit, for calling up. I recognise that ifthis proposal is adopted, there will be some cases where the immediate calling upof young men from small family farms would result in difficulty, but the existing machinery for the grant of postponement of calling up on grounds of exceptionalhardship until alternative arrangements can be made should largely meet thesecases.
Medical Standards1.4. I understand that, in view of the general man-power stringency, the service departments are considering, as a matter of urgency, how far they can accept and use for appropriate work some of the men placed in Medical Grades III or IV whoare not at present called-up, and that the War Office and Air Ministry have already made some suggestions. There is no legal obstacle to calling-up these men and,subject to the advice of my Medical Advisory Committee of which Lord Horderis Chairman, I am ready to call-up any men whom the Services are prepared toaccept. I hope that it will be possible to reach early conclusions on this and to implement them quickly. About 18,000 men a year are at present placed in grade III and about 25,000 a year in Grade IV.Reduction of Age of Call-up15. The possibilities under this head are limited to the registration of thewhole or part of one extra quarter of an age-group and are open now only because in 1948, when we were faced with a surplus of National Service men, one of theregular quarterly registrations was omitted. On existing deferment rules and medical standards, the whole of the quarter of an age-group would produce about30,000 men for call-up within a period of three to four months after registration,while about 15,000 more would become available for calling-up on expiry ofdeferments, &amp;c. at various later dates. This step would of itself meet the position for the moment. There is, however, a fairly general view that it would be a goodthing if the age of call-up in the normal case could go higher than the present ageof a little above 18 years 3 months for example, because young men would be moremature when called-up and would have had more time to settle in jobs after leavingschool. To lower the age of call-up to 18 again would, from this point of view, bea retrograde step. It would also be unwelcome to the Services who can make onlyrestricted use of National Service men until they are 18, and I do not recommend it.I have, in fact, already announced my decision to bring the registrations whiohwould normally have taken place early in March and June 1951 forward by a month in each case to early in February and May respectively. I hope, however, that the speedy adoption of the recommendations in this Paper will enable me to get backto normal by holding the next registrations thereafter at the customary dates earlyin September and December 1951.16.   My conclusions are (1) that the indefinite deferment of the calling-up of young agricultural workersis no longer justified and should be discontinued forthwith-that is,young men in agriculture who register in 1951 should be made availablefor call-up. Allowing for medical rejections, this should produce about15,000 more young men a year;(2) that arrangements should be made as speedily as possible for the postingto the Services for employment on suitable duties of as many of the menplaced in Medical Grades III or IV as they can accept.G.
