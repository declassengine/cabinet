THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY^   GOVERNMENT      /Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1951SECRETCP. (51) 2619?/z January, 1951CABINETRECALL OF CLASS &quot;Z&quot; RESERVISTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for WarThis paper contains details of the proposal mentioned in paragraph 10 of cp. (5.1) 16 to recall certain reservists for .15 days&apos; training with their units during1951. It does not deal with the more extensive proposals mentioned in para-graph 11 of that paper.2. Summary of Proposal(i) It is proposed to recall 80,000 reservists, mainly Class &quot; Z,&quot; for the FirstContingent of the Territorial Army and 35,000 reservists, mainlyClass &quot; Z,&quot; for Anti-Aircraft Command. The 80,000 are required tobring the four divisions of the Territorial Army which are requiredfor despatch overseas within the first three months of war up to an effective training strength for the 1951 camps. The 35,000 for Anti-Aircraft Command (including some 2,500 vital specialists) represent themaximum number capable of absorption for training by the TerritorialArmy units of Anti-Aircraft Command in 1951. The recalled reservistswill get the same training as the Territorial unit to which they areposted undergoes at its annual camp. In effect, the Territorial^ obliga-tion to attend an annual training camp, (but not his other obligations)would be imposed on these reservists at any rate during 1951. It is most important that the training given shall be, and shall seem to thereservist to be, effective and valuable.(ii) The 15-day period of call-up will enable the reservist to be tested, gradedand allotted his proper place in his unit. Three days should be spent onreception, medical inspection and grading, 10J days on training and 1-idays on dispersal.(iii) Although technically &quot; Z &quot; and other equivalent reservists might be recalledfor training without legislation, it is suggested that, in view of its unprecedented-cedented nature, a Bill should be introduced to cover the proposed call-up, to provide penalties for failure to comply with call-up notices and tosafeguard reservists as regards their civil employment. It is proposed toprovide that the new Act should operate for one year only but that itmight be extended yearly up to and including 1954 by Order in Council.It is recommended that the Bill should be introduced before the endof January and that an announcement should be made as soon asthe House meets.(iv) Those selected for call-up will be a cross-section of the reservists who havebeen earmarked for recall on general mobilisation who, in turn, wereselected on the broad principle of &quot; last out, first back.&quot; Is is estimatedthat over one-third of those recalled will be men who began their military service after the end of the late war.(v) Provision will be made for exemption in cases of &quot; hardship &quot;: to thosecalled up it is proposed that a form of compensation for disturbanceshould be paid namely, a bounty of  4.(vi) The call-up will be spread over 6 months but the bulk of the reservistswill be called up between mid-June and mid-August. Not more than20,000 men should be under training on any one day.(vii) The cost of the proposed measures is estimated at  2f million, of which ^ million will be the &quot;cost of the bounty.Copy No.32
State of Readiness of the Army3. The deterioration in the international situation compels us to seek new methods of improving the readiness of our Armed Forces.4. This Paper deals with a predominantly army aspect of this problem,, butit will be seen from paragraph 19 that the R.A.F. have a similar problem.5. In order to meet our commitments in land forces for Western europe and the Middle East we have to plan to use the first contingent (four divisions) ofthe Territorial Army within the first three months of war. In addition, Anti-aircraft command, which is largely manned by the Territorial Army, is required to be in astate of full readiness on D-Day.6. The man-power build-up of the Territorial Army and Anti-aircraft command is, however, still in its early stages. Not till mid-1954 will the outflow of ex-national service men doing their part-time service with the Territorial Armybring units and formations up to an effective training strength, and there is a serious shortage of senior N.C.Os.7. If mobilisation should be necessary before 1954 it is planned to make goodthese deficiencies in the Reserve Army and in Anti-Aircraft Command by the selective recall of reservists, predominantly &quot; Z &quot; reservists. These &quot; Z &quot; reservistsare largely men called up for service under the National Service Act of 1939 for the duration of the Emergency and who have since been released from the Colours.They have, however, had no training since they were released, and for the mostpart are completely unknown to the units which they will join on mobilisation.Moreover, they constitute a majority of the war strength of the formations and units they are to join. Without them many of these would be little more than cadres.8. As a step towards remedying these weaknesses, it is proposed that some115,000 reservists, mainly &quot; Z &quot; reservists, should be recalled for 15 days&apos; trainingin 1951. This number is made up of some 80,000 for the First Contingent, Terri-torial Army, and a further 35,000 for Anti-Aircraft Command, which includessome 2,500 vital specialists. The figure of 115,000 includes some 5,000 officers fromthe Royal Army Reserve of Officers, the Territorial Reserve of Officers, the supplementary Reserve of Officers and emergency commissioned officers relegatedto unemployment.9.   The advantages to be gained from these proposals are:  (a) Officers, N.C.Os. and men will get to know each other, the actual individualworth of reservists can be judged and they can be fitted into their places in the team. Medical examination can be carried out. All of these willgreatly speed up mobilisation should it be ordered.(b) Reservists will be brought up to date and units which are at present far too weak to be able to carry out effective unit training will be able todo so. This will have a considerable effect on the state of readiness of units and formations.(c) A gesture of this sort is likely to have a marked effect both in this countryand externally on those people who doubt our ability and intention toplace reserve formations in the field at an early date after mobilisation.(Incidentally, the French propose to call up 175,000 reservists forthree weeks&apos; training in 1951.)(d) There is at least a good chance that some of the best men called up withthese Territorial Army units, realising that they may have to fight withthem, will become Territorial Army volunteers in these units.Scope of the Training Proposed10. Training in the Territorial Army has hitherto had to be restricted gener-ally to the platoon level or at most to company level with sub-units specially built up for the occasion. Effective training of companies or battalions has not beenpossible. The posting in of reservists to make up deficiencies by ranks, trades and special skills will give the units the necessary trained men to carry out effectivecollective training..11. Apart from any question of cost or relative state of readiness, the numberof units selected for receiving reservists has been based on the practical possibilityof available training areas and such factors.
12; The training provided for these selected units will be more realistic andmore&apos; valuable than, has been possible since the reconstitution Of the TerritorialArmy.&apos;/,&apos;,&quot;( &quot;&apos;&apos;i&apos;s\,. if!.&apos;&quot;&apos;&quot;&quot;/&apos;,-iJ&apos; -?   &apos;-&apos;t K::&apos;^&apos;,\:    - &quot;   J&apos; :^01 ,,13. The 15-day period will enable the individual reservist to be fitted into theteam: This implies testing :him, sizing him up and exercising him with the othermen of his detachment or unit: Not only will the unit and the detachment benefit from ithe training, but individual weaknesses i can be detected and many of themeliminated before the next camp training period or before the unit may be called on to mobilise and begin intensive collective training; ^14. It is visualised that the first three days will be taken up with travelling,medical inspection, issue of clothing, &amp;c, verification of documents, and detailed assessment of the man&apos;s military value to the unit and his exact place in it. If the unit equipment is strange to the individual reservist, time may be found during thisperiod to begin instruction in its use. The remainder of the period, less the finalone-and-a-half days for handing over clothing and equipment and for travelling,will be devoted entirely to training.15.   The principal problems in implementing these proposals are:  (a) Legal. Whilst technically it would be possible to recall &quot; Z &quot; and equiva-lent reservists for training it was stated in the regulations governingthese reserves that they would not be liable to attend for this purpose.It is therefore suggested that a Bill should be introduced which wouldinter alia (i) confer on the Service authorities power to serve &quot; training notices &quot;requiring any reservist, up to the age of 45, to undergo a periodof training not exceeding 15 days in a year on the same terms and subject to the sanctions* as are applicable to national servicemen when they are summoned for training during part-time service. The age limit has been included in order to keep to aminimum the number of reservists made liable to recall and because the higher age groups contain the greatest proportionof unfit men. An age limit below 45 would exclude many seniorN.C.O.S and highly skilled tradesmen, very important to thescheme.(ii) Safeguard reservists against dismissal from their civil employment and their rights to a paid annual holiday outside the period ofreservist training to the same extent as national service men are so protected.(iii) Provide for its operation for one year only.  It would, however, bedesirable to take power to extend the new Act year by year upto and including 1954 by Order in Council, subject to affirmative resolutions of both Houses of Parliament. The National service act, 1948, does not extend to men who became 18 years of ageafter 1st January, 1954, but there is power to extend this date by Order in Council. Unless the international situation im-proves it is contemplated that the recall of reservists for train-ing will be necessary in 1952 and possibly 1953 and 1954 on asimilar scale to &quot;that proposed in paragraph 8. After 1954 itwill not be necessary since the Territorial divisions covered willhave been brought up to strength by the inflow of ex-nationalservice men.(b) Reassuring of individuals. As the Bill will impose a liability for recall fortraining on all of the 3 million &quot; Z &quot; and equivalent Army reservists(provided they are not. over 45 years of age) it will be essential to reassure the immense majority of these men, men who will not berequired for training, at the earliest possible moment. Therefore whennotice is given of the Governments intention to introduce the Bill.astatement should be included giving the numbers to be recalled fortraining during 1951. The number for the Army will be 115,000 (gross)in order to allow for medical rejects and hardship cases.* The national service man who fails to comply with a training notice without reasonable excuseis liable to a fine up to  25 if tried in a civil court and to a maximum sentence of two years&apos; detentionor imprisonment if tried by Court-Martial.

As the Bill will impose a liability for recall fortraining on all of the 3 million &quot; Z &quot; and equivalent Army reservists..,       (provided they are not over 45 years of age) it will be essential to:  , reassure the immense majority of these men, men who will not be,,. required for training, at the earliest possible moment.  Therefore whennotice is given of the Governments intention to introduce the Bill astatement should be included giving the numbers to be recalled fortraining during 1951. The number for the Army will be 115,000 (gross)in order to allow for medical rejects and hardship cases.* The national service man who fails to comply with a training notice without reasonable excuseis liable to a fine up to  25 if tried in a civil court and to a maximum sentence of two years&apos; detentionor imprisonment if tried by Court-Martial.t
As the majority of the complicated schedules for holidays with payare completed by civilian employers by the end of January, it is neces-sary that all those who are to be recalled should be so informed atthe earliest possible date. It is visualised that when the Bill is intro:duced they will receive their training notices within a very limited period (probably 21 days) of the Bill becoming law. It is, therefore,proposed that we should announce at the outset that those who do not receive training notices by the end of that period will know that theyare not required in 1951.(c) Method of Selection. The overall system prepared for the selection of&quot;Z&quot; and equivalent reservists for recall on general mobilisation hasbeen based On the broad principle of &quot;last out, first back.&quot;Very large numbers of these reservists have already been screenedby the Ministry of Labour and have been earmarked for recall to theArmy on mobilisation. They have been allocated to all units andformations which will be required to mobilise in the opening stages ofa general mobilisation. These men have been selected with consider-able care according to their regiments or corps, rank and trade on leaving the Army. It is a cross section of these reservists which it is desired to recall for training in 1951.To recall these reservists by any other system than their presentallocation to units would not only cut right across our existing mobility-sation arrangements, but would also fail to provide many of the officers,n.c.os and specialists who are essential to the purpose of the scheme,but who inevitably cannot be found in the more recent age and servicegroups.Of the reservists involved under the present scheme it is estimatedthat over one-third will belong to age and service groups which begantheir service after the end of the war. These were especially fortunatein that they neither served in the war nor incurred a liability fortraining as reservists.The units with which the men will train are widely spread throughout GreatBritain.(d) Hardship Cases. Provision will have to be made to excuse from trainingthose men who can show that their absence from home will causeespecial hardship.   These cases can broadly be classified as follows:  Domestic (family) hardship.Family medical cases, crippled wife, &amp;c.One-man business.Educational   cases,   chiefly  Technical   College  students   withexaminations.It is estimated that there may be some 25,000 appeals fromreservists getting warning notices. Over 50 per cent, of these will becases that can be refused immediately, the remainder will require more detailed examination. It is expected that some 5,000 appeals maysucceed.(e) Disturbance Compensation. While they are training, the men will receivenormal regular rates of pay and allowances and of course their travelling expenses, but it is thought that in addition it will be desirable to provide some form of compensation for disturbance. It is suggested that we payeach man a bounty of  4. This is the same amount as is given to theTerritorial for attendance at annual camp. He regards this as a pay-ment for loss of earnings, though this is not the official view.Cost16. It has been roughly estimated that the cost of training these men on theproposed basis will be about  2J million, of which  500,000 will be the cost of thebounty.Effects on the Country17. In 1951 the training (excluding a few high-grade specialists in Anti-Aircraft Command) will be spread over six months, the bulk of the reservists being called up between mid-June and mid-August.
&apos;        ill.On an average about 15,000 would be serving at any one time. It is not antici-pated that more than 20,000 men would be training on any one day.Urgency18. For the reasons given in sub-paragraph 15 (b) it is of the greatest import-ance that the necessary legislation should be obtained at the earliest possible moment.The Bill should be introduced during January at the latest and an announcement should be made as soon as the House meets.19. These proposals relate only to the Army, but it is understood that theAir Ministry wish to seek similar powers in respect of a number of released R.A.F.personnel..T.
