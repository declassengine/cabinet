/THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTThe circulation  of this  paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal&quot; use of...............A/Crv-TrvO/v- &quot;-Biiro-^TOP SECRET Copy No. &quot;1 ft^CP.(51) 2519TH JANUARY, 1951CABINETDEFENCE PROGRAMMES 1951/54Memorandum by the Minister of defence i have carefully considered the report of the Working Partyappointed to consider the acceleration of our defence preparations asa result of the discussion in the Cabinet on 18th December(CM.(50) 87th Conclusions, Minute 1).     This report has now been circulated to the Cabinet under cover of a memorandum by the Chiefsof Staff (CP.(51) 16) in which they endorse the Working Party&apos;sproposals.     I have had the advantage of discussing the report with mycolleagues, the three Service Ministers, and the observations belowrepresent their views as well as my own.Man-power2. We agree in principle on the necessity in present circum-stances for building up the strength of the Armed Forces.     In particularwe think it important that plans for mobilising our forces in the event ofwar should be improved and perfected.     We believe, however, that someof the proposals in the report are more drastic than the present inter-national situation requires, and that they would be politically unacceptableat the present time.3. The proposals are broadly of three kinds:-(a) The scheme for calling up a number of Army Class Z andAir Force Class G reservists for fifteen daysr training.The Secretary of State for War is circulating a separate memorandum giving full details of this proposal as faras it affects the Army Class Z Reserve.(b) A proposal to retain time-expired regulars for varyingperiods and to call up regular reservists.(c) Proposals for embodying the fighter squadrons of the RoyalAuxiliary Air Force for three months&apos; training and forcalling up certain Army Class Z reservists for periods of up to three months.4. We are in agreement with the first of these proposals, namely the proposal to call up a number of Z Class reservists for training withthe Auxiliary Forces for a period of fifteen days.     This would amountto an exercise in mobilisation and would substantially improve our readiness for war without giving rise to insuperable difficulties of a
-    10rpractical and political kind.     It has been suggested that no men over45 years of age should be called up under this scheme.     We ourselvesshould prefer that no men over 40 years of age should be called upexcept possibly for training with A.A. Command.     We should also have liked to give effect to the principle of &quot;last out, first back&quot; bycalling up only those Z Class reservists who saw no active service during the war, but we are satisfied that if the scheme is to serve its purpose as a mobilisation exercise it will be impossible to limit it inthis way.5. Our air defence system will also be strengthened by calling up for fifteen days1 training Class G reservists with specialisedexperience in order to improve the operational readiness of the controland reporting system, on. which our fighter and A.A. defences are wholly dependent, and of-other key elements of our air defences.6. We also agree with the proposal to extend the period ofservice of time-expired regulars.     We accept the period of twelvemonths proposed by the Army and the Royal Air Force.     The Navy,however, request that the period should be eighteen months;   their primary purpose is to enable the complements of ships in commissionto be brought up to full peace-time strength and to enable further new construction ships and Reserve Fleet ships to be adequately manned -a purpose which will not be achieved without unacceptable reductions inefficiency if the period of men&apos;s service was restricted to twelve months.Nor do we see any objection to calling up Royal Fleet Reservists andR.A.F. Reservists (R.A.F.V.R. and Regular) for a period of regularservice, since these men have a clear liability to recall, for which theyare either paid or receive an annual bounty.     These measures willboth help to meet the principal need, which is for additional numbersof men who are already trained.7. We do not, however, recommend acceptance of the proposalto call up members of the Z Class reserve for periods up to threemonths for training with the active forces.     We believe that such aproposal would give rise to the following difficulties:-(a)     It would cause serious dislocation and loss of effort in industry.(b) Employers would feel the need to replace men who wereto be absent for as long as three months, but would inthe circumstances find it virtually impossible to do so.(c) It would involve differential treatment between one individual and another.     It is true that this objection would apply equally to the fifteen-day scheme, but the discontent wouldbe infinitely greater in respect of a three-months&apos; periodof call-up.8. Moreover, we are not satisfied that the present international situation, serious though it is, justifies us in adopting a measure whichwould give rise to such formidable difficulties.    If it were to deteriorate further, the proposal might have to be reconsidered.9. In view of the great importance of Fighter Command as our first line of defence against attack, we think there is much to be said for the proposal to embody the Fighter Squadrons of the Royal
Auxiliary Air Force for a period of three months in order to increase their operational readiness.     These fighter squadrons are at present40 per cent of the day fighter strength in the United Kingdom.     Theannual period of fifteen days&apos; training supplemented by week-endflying is not sufficient to bring the pilots up to full operational standards and more continuous training is needed for this purpose.      This might,of course, give rise to the political difficulties referred to above, butwe believe that there would be a stronger case for justifying this measure.     We also suggest that an effort should be made to persuadeas many men as possible, including members of the Z Class reserve,to join the Auxiliary Forces as volunteers.     If the ground were suitablyprepared, such an appeal might well achieve considerable success.Production10. We are disappointed to note from Section 2 of the report annexed to C.P.(51) 16 that it does not seem possible wholly to telescopethe 1951/54 production plan so as to complete it by the end of 1952.Even if the necessary raw materials and machine tools were availablein sufficient quantities and at the right time, it appears that such a drastic measure of acceleration is not really practicable.     We must therefore accept the rather less ambitious targets described in thereport.     Even so, very drastic measures are required, and the necessary action will have to be taken with all possible despatch.Summary of Recommendations11. It is therefore recommended: -(a) That regular reservists be called up for service with theregular forces, as recommended in paragraph 71(a) of cp.(51) 16.(b) That the fighter squadrons of the Royal Auxiliary Air Forcebe embodied for three months&apos; training.(c) That certain reservists (from Class Z in the case of theArmy, Class G in the case of the Royal Air Force) becalled up for fifteen days&apos; training.(d) That time-expired regulars should continue to be retained in the Army and Royal Air Force for periods up to twelvemonths and in the Royal Navy for eighteen months.(e) That a special appealbe made, especially to Z Classreservists, to join the Auxiliary Forces voluntarily.E.S.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1,19TH JANUARY, 1951.
