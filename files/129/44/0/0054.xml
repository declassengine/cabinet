(50) 315).H. G.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,\5th February, 1951.ECONOMIC REPORTL-Man-PowerThere was the usual seasonal fall in the working population in December,but over the whole year 1950 it increased by 225,000-96,000 males and 129,000females.2. The strength of the Armed Forces has been steadily increasing from the lowest post-war level reached in May 1950. In the last quarter of the year thenumber of men in the Forces increased by 45,000 and the number of women inthe Womens Services declined by 1,000. The total strength at the end of 1950was 752,000 the highest figure since August 1949.3. The total number in civil employment declined in December by 97,000.The industries chiefly affected were building and contracting, distribution, food,drink and tobacco, and professional, financial and miscellaneous services. Therewas also a small decline of 2,000 in the metals, engineering and vehicles trades, butthe number in these trades was still 117,000 more than a year ago.4. The number of persons unemployed in Great Britain rose from 302,000at the 11th December, 1950 to 334,000 at the 15th January, 1951. The increasea year ago was from 330,000 in December, 1949 to 372,000 in January 1950. Inrecent months unemployment has been about 10 per cent, less than in thecorresponding periods in the two preceding years.5. Unemployment in the Development Areas has fallen in recent months.At 15th January there were 122,400 persons unemployed in Development Areas,compared with 144,200 in January, 1950. Although the number unemployed inthese areas still account for nearly two-fifths of the total unemployed in GreatBritain, unemployment in the Development Areas has in recent months been falling rather more quickly than in the rest of the country.II.-Production6. The Interim Index of Industrial Production reached the record level of150 in October and November (average 1946=100) and will probably averagebetween 147 and 148 for the fourth quarter of the year. The index for the wholeof 1950 is estimated at 140 compared with 129 for the year 1949-an increase of.    40110 b
8  per cent. Nearly half this increase is attributed to expansion in the chemical,engineering and.vehicles trades.Cqal7. During- 1950, the output of coal (deep-mined and opencast) was 216-3 million tons against 215-1 million tons in 1949. (The estimate for 1950 given inthe Economic Survey was 218 to 223 million tons.) Inland consumption amountedto 202-4 million tons against an estimate of 199 to 201 million tons.Coal; output, consumption and exportsMillion tons	1949	1950			Economic Survey estimate	Actual (52 weeks)Production  Deep-mined        ...............

In the first six weeks of 1951, the output of deep-mined coal averaged4,124,000 tons a week, about If per cent, above the level in the correspondingperiod in 1950. Opencast coal, however, only amounted to 176,000 tons a weekagainst 220,000 tons a week last year, so that total output so far this year is only slightly more than in the corresponding period in 1950.9. At the beginning of 1950, the number of wage earners on the colliery bookswas 709,000. The number fell steadily to 686,000 in November and has since risenweek by week; at 3rd February, 1951, it had regained the figure of the previous Julyof 697,000. During the first five weeks of this year absenteeism, both voluntary and involuntary, has been higher than a year ago and the percentage rate averaged15-34 per cent, this year against 12-51 per cent, for the first weeks of 1950. Butthe reason for this is mainly, an increase in the number of possible shifts. Theaverage numtjer of man shifts worked per worker has been much the same as lastyear. Moreover, output per man shift averaged 1 - 24 tons in January against-19 tons in January last year. The corresponding figures at the coal face show asimilar improvement1 3 - 20 tons against 3-10 tons last year.Steel10. The output of steel ingots and castings in 1950 was 16-29 million tonsagainst an estimate in the Economic Survey of 151.-16 million tons. This was anincrease of nearly 5 per cent, above 1949. In January 1951 output was slightly lower than m January last year.11. The output of pig iron in 1950 was 9,633,000 tons compared with9,499,000 tons in 1949. So far this year weekly output has averaged about 183,100tons which was slightly less than the 186,400 tons in the corresponding weeks of1950.12. Stocks of pig iron at steel works and steel foundries at the end of Januaryamounted to 446,000 tons, nearly one-fifth less than the total at the end of January1950. Stocks of scrap at these works are very much lower; they amounted to565,000 tons compared with 835,000 tons a year ago.-Textiles13: Output of cotton, spun rayon and mixture yarn&amp; in 1950 amounted to1,052 million lb. against an estimate of 1,040 million lb. given in the economic survey, Output in 1950 was 6 per cent, higher titan in 1949. In the first weeks of 1951 however it was slightly less than in the corresponding weeks in 1950. The
number of workers in the industry is still increasing but production has been lostthis year because of higher sickness rates.14. Output of rayon yarn and staple fibre reached record levels in october and November and the total for the fourth quarter of 1950 was 98-5 million lb. 22 per cent, more than in the last quarter of 1949. For the whole year, outputamounted to 371-3 million lb. and exceeded the estimate given in the economic survey by 6 per cent. :15. Production of woven cotton and rayon fabrics reached 60 million linearyards a week in October and was only slightly below this figure in November.Production fell to 52 million linear yards a week in December. Throughout theyear output was approximately 10 per cent, higher than in 1949.16. Worsted yarn and woven wool fabrics reached record post-war levels inNovember. Worsted yarn output for the month was 20-62 million lb. and the out-put of fabrics was 42-84 million square yards. The output of both yarn and fabricshas now exceeded the average monthly rate of output in 1937 for two successivemonths.Motor vehicles17. Production of passenger cars and chassis reached the record weeklyaverage of 11,628 in November but declined to 8,872 a week in December. Thetotal for the year was 522,515 vehicles, of these 409,510 were for export. About86 per cent, of the vehicles exported were complete cars and the rest were chassis.18.   Output of commercial vehicles and chassis fell from 5,454 a week inNovember to 4,541 a week in December.   The total for the year was 261,157against 216,373 for 1949. The number for export in 1950 was 164,829, representing^about 63 per cent, of the total produced.Merchant shipbuilding1-9.   The tonnage of merchant shipping completed in 1950 was slightly higher*-than in previous years.  The tonnage of vessels under construction at the end ofthe year was 1,861,000 gross tons, about the same as at the end of 1949.20. The amount of repair work and conversion has been steadily decliningand 1,885,000 gross tons were in hand in November, the lowest total reached sincethe end of the war. There was a slight recovery at the turn of the year and thefigure rose to 2,372,000 gross tons at the end of January.Building21. The number of permanent houses completed in Great Britain during1950 was 198,171 compared with 197,627 in 1949. The number under constructionat the end of the year was 201,408 which was slightly higher than at the end of 1949.22. Although the production of building bricks reached its highest post-war level in 1950, producers&apos; stocks at the end of the year were low:Building bricks (millions)Production End-year stocks1946       .............      3,450 2701947       ......      ......      4,535 3481948..........      ...      4,600 5151949       ...      ...      ...      ...      5,227 1791950       ...      ..........      5,923 16223. Stocks of bricks reached their lowest point in July 1950, when theyamounted to 106 million, but although since then the total has been raised to 162million at the end of the year, this figure represents a little more than one week&apos;sdeliveries at the average rate of consumption for the last six months.III.-Stocks24. Stocks of food and raw materials were declining throughout 1950, Itis estimated that between December 1949 and December 1950 stocks of food and feeding-stuffs fell by 22 per cent, and stocks of raw materials (excluding petroleum and tobacco) by 15 per cent. Stocks of petroleum products showed little changeover the year, and tobacco stocks recovered during the last quarter of the year toa level higher than at the end of 1949.
25. With the exception of fertilizers, all groups of raw materials were affectedby the general decline in stocks; the largest reductions were in stocks of paper and paper-making materials; and in timber.Number of weeks consumption in stocks of certain raw materials	Average weekly rate of				consumption in		Number of weeks		January to March,		consumption in stocks		Thousand tons.					1951	End of	End of	1950	. forecast	Dec. 1949	Dec. 1950Copper ...      ......      ......	6-7	6-5	20	16Zinc......	4-7	3-6	13	10Nickel   .........      ...	0-4	0-4	16	9Raw wool       ............	5-3	5-0	25	18Sulphur...............	8-8	6-0	11	13     \wood pulp	28-2	27-9	11	8Newsprint       ............	15-1	11-7	11	iv. Internal Financial Situation26. The evidence continues to be of a distinctly higher level of demand than six months ago. The seasonal increase in unemployment has been very small thisyear and unemployment in January was 38,000 less than in the two previous years..This suggests the beginning of a high level of demand, and the prospects are that further increases will follow. The rise in prices which has taken place up to now is not, however, evidence of an inflationary pressure of demand at home, but isalmost wholly due to the rise in import prices.Prices, Wages and other indices of the current situation .27. Import prices. Import prices have continued to rise rapidly. The index of import prices (1947=100) was 150 in December, an increase of 13 per cent,since June and 36 per cent, since September 1949. Raw material prices have risen32 per cent, since June.28. Wholesale prices. Wholesale prices have also continued to rise. TheBoard of Trade index (1938 = 100) was 288 in December compared with 252 inJune. Most of the rise has been due to increased prices of industrial materials and manufactures.29. Retail prices. The Interim Index of Retail Prices stood at 116 in Novem-ber and December compared with 115 in October. This was the expected increasefollowing a rise in prices of sausages, potatoes and fresh fruit and a further increasein prices of clothing and household goods.30. Export prices. Export prices advanced two points in November and afurther two points in December. The index (1947 = 100) was 123 in October,125 in November and 127 in December, 10 per cent, higher than a year ago.31. Wage rates. After remaining stationary for the first nine months ofthe year, the Ministry of Labour&apos;s wage rate index rose four points betweenthe end of September and the end of December from 110 to 114 (July 1947=100).This compares with a rise of only one point during the whole year 1949.32. During December 899,000 work people received increases in their weeklyand full-time wages amounting to  223,000. Over the year as a whole increases irtweekly wages amounted to about  2,020,000 shared between 7,350,000 workers;1(The comparable figures for 1949 were  1,076,000 and 5,200,000). Only 1\ percent, of the wage increases were affected by means of sliding scale increases basedon the Index of Retail Prices; the remainder were arranged by direct negotiation,Joint Industrial Councils, Wages Councils and arbitration. .\33. Important wage claims outstanding include those of railway, clothing and-iurniture workers. \34. Retail Sales and Stocks. Retail sales increased a little in November and&quot;sharply in December. Total sales of large-scale shops in November were 8 per cent:&apos;
higher than a year ago; in December they were 12 per Cent, higher. There were also larger increases in sales in many items of trade by independent retailers. for both large and small retailers much of the increase in December was concentrated on furniture and apparel, sales of the latter being 17 per cent, higher than inDecember 1949,, 35. Stocks of large-scale retailers were only a little higher in November and december than they were a year ago. Stocks of non-food merchandise were 11 percent, higher in November and 6 per cent, higher by value in December than a yearago. There was a sharp fall in retail stocks of apparel during December. Whole-sale apparel stocks have continued to fall.36. Bankruptcies: Bankruptcies gazetted during the twelve months endedJanuary 1951 were numbered 1,939 compared with 1,612 in the twelve month sending January 1950. 161 bankruptcies were gazetted during January this yearcompared with 137 in the previous January.37. Orders on Hand. The monthly value of contracts placed by the Ministryof Supply in September, October and November was three times as great as in thethree months preceding the Korean War. There is no sign Of any relaxation bitsteel-makers&apos; order books. The sheet steel position has become more difficultbecause of a shortfall in imports from America and Of increasing demands forrearmament. Shortages ot many non-ferrous metals aife becoming increasinglyacute and prices Continue to rise. Orders for&apos; new ships placed in 1950 Were 1$million gross tons against less than \ million in 1949; approximately half the new orders were for tanker tonnage. There is no falling off in demand for building and civil engineering work.Money and Credit38. Bank loans increased in December to a level about 8 per cent, higher thanin December 1949. Advances to customers by the London Clearing Banks (roughlyrepr&amp;enlirig; frarik accommodation to the private sector) stood at  1,644 million on 31st December. This was an increase of  34 million over the previous month and of  121 million over December 1949. The total money at call, bills dis-* counted, Treasury Deposit receipts and investment (which roughly represents direct and indirect bank acccommodation to the Government) was  3,983 million inDecember compared with  3,984 million in November and  3,985 million in theprevious December.39. Bank deposits rose seasonally during December from  6,25.1 million to 6,368 million, at which level they were  166 million or 2J per cent, above&apos; theprevious December.&apos;40. After rising for the first eleven months of the year security prices fellslightly in December. The Actuaries&apos; Index of ordinary share prices (1938 = 100)averaged 128-6 in January, rose to a peak of 143-6 in November and declined to140-6 in December. Gilt-edged prices have followed a similar course. Two anda half per cent. Consols rose from 69-7 in January to 73 - 4 in October, decliningover the next two months to average of 71 -1 in December. The rate of interest has there fore risen slightly, the yield on Consols having increased from 3 - 40 in october to 3-52 in December. This trend has continued in the new year, the yield nowbeing about 3-60.Vf External Financial SituationExternal Trade41&apos;. In December imports rose to the record level of  239-3 milhori, makingthe total for the year  2,603 million, compared with  2,274 million in 1949. Mostof the rise between the two years was due to the rise in prices since the volume ofretained imports in 1950 is estimated to be about the same as in 1949 arid one-tenthbelow the volume in 1938.42. Exports fell from the record level of  211-8 million in November to 188-9 million itt December. The total for the year was  2,170 million against 1,786 million in 1949. The volume of exports m the fourth quarter of&apos; 1950 wa\s75r pei* cent, a&amp;ow trie^ average for 1947, and for the whole year it was 61&apos; per cent,above 1947 and 16 per cent, above 1949:43. Exports to North America reached the record level of  28-3 millibn inNovember, but fell to  21 - 8 million in December.

Gold and Dollar Accounts. After reaching the exceptional figure of$305 million in October 1950 the sterling area gold and dollar surplus fell backin November and December to more normal levels ($41 million and $51 million respectively). North American sterling balances, whose build-up accounted for alarge part of the October surplus, fell by over  8 million during the two followingmonths, and have continued to fall at an accelerated rate in January ( 14J million).By the end of last month nearly two-thirds of the October addition had been worked off. In spite of this a gold and dollar surplus of about $80 million, including$23 million from E.P.U., was recorded in January. Though no detailed explanationis yet possible it seems likely that increased earnings, particularly from Rest of sterling Area exports, which are seasonally high, are in large part responsible forthis favourable result. A continued short-fall in expenditure on United Kingdomdollar imports, compared with the programme, has also played a part, but this has its adverse implications for our production and the level of our stocks.45. Sterling Liabilities. The United KingdomV sterling liabilities have continued to increase very rapidly, an increase confined entirely to the Rest of the sterling Area, which has added  93 million to its holdings in the two monthsNovember-December. All the main Rest of the Sterling Area countries have sharedin this increase, the largest gainers being Australia, South Africa and Malaya.There are no signs of any real slackening in the movement, which must be expectedto continue as long as most Rest of the Sterling Area countries are enjoying moreor less substantial surpluses in their own balance of payments.European Payments Union46. The overall United Kingdom position in the European Payments union for December 1950 showed a net surplus of  20-5 million, which, together with theinterest on credits to the Union for the half-year, makes a total of  170-1 million for the period July to December 1950. Of this total,  53-6 million has to be written off-against conditional aid and after allowing for the use of  15 - 4 million of sterling balances by other countries to meet deficits with the Union, the United Kingdomreceived  12-7 million in gold or dollars and a credit with E.P.U. of  88-4 million.The United Kingdom net surplus for January is  17-5 million (provisional figure).The amount of gold and credit by which this surplus will be settled depends on theextent to which Italy and Sweden use their existing sterling resources to settletheir January deficits, which were  7-1 million and  7 million respectively.47. Western Germany has been granted a special credit of $120 million (tobe used pan passu with $60 million of gold payments). Her position improvedsomewhat in November ($33 million deficit) and December ($34 million deficit),but with a deficit of $42 million in January she will have used nearly half of thiscredit. The Managing Board are examining the position of other countries wherethere appears to be danger of an extreme position developing. The most urgentof these is Greece, who is running a large deficit. The United Kingdom and Franceare the two chief creditor countries of Western Europe, and they have explainedt^ the Managing Board how they see their surpluses developing and what measures,if any, they propose to take.
