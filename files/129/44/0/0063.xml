THIS  DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTI-.-  /Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1951SECRET Copy No. 3 1CP. (51) 6326th February, 1951CABINETJAPANESE   PEACE   TREATY:    DRAFT   PUBLIC   STATEMENT   on individual CLAIMS AGAINST Japan Memorandum by the Minister of state the Foreign Secretary was invited by the Cabinet on 2nd January to arrangefor the preparation of a draft public statement embodying the Cabinet decision notto pursue individual olaims against Japan (CM. (51) 1st Meeting, Conclusion 3).I attach at annex a draft of a public statement which has now been agreed bythe Far East (Official) Committee. The Committee have recommended that inview of the strong feeling on this subject in the Commonwealth, particularly inAustralia, the attention of Ministers should be drawn to the desirability of inform-ing Commonwealth Governments of the contents of the&quot; public statement, as approved by them, in advance of its being made.As desired by the Cabinet, I have consulted and obtained the agreement of theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Defence and the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies to the draft statement at annex. They also agree with me in recommending, as suggested by the Far East (Official) Committee, that, if theCabinet approves this draft statement, it should be sent to Commonwealth Govern-ments for information a reasonable time in advance of its being made. TheSecretary of State for the Colonies proposes at the same time to send the statement to the Governments of those Colonies which suffered at the hands of the Japaneseduring the war and to invite their comments, if any, on its terms. He would wishany such comments to be given consideration before the statement is made public.K. G. Y.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,26th February, 1951.annex draft of a Public Statement on Individual Claims against JapanWith the indulgence of the House I should like to make a statement on thequestion of individual claims for loss of, or damage to, property and for personal injury, ill-treatment and death suffered at Japanese hands during the war.2. It is not the practice of His Majesty&apos;s Government to make public theinstructions which they propose to give to delegations entrusted with the negotiation of treaties. However, they consider that the present case is exceptional, firstbecause a Japanese peace treaty has been long delayed, and, secondly, because nointernational agreement concerning the payment of individual claims comparable to the resolutions contained in the final Act of the Paris Conference on Reparation40195
has been concluded amongst the Powers at war with Japan. In these specialcircumstances the Government believe that a statement of their attitude at this time will be in the public interest. (I am not referring to any questions relating to theultimate settlement of outstanding pre-war debts.)3.&apos; Individual claims against Japan fall into two main classes; first, claims inrespect of loss of or damage to property, including financial losses, within Japan orin territories over-run by the Japanese during the war; and secondly, claims arisingout of personal injury, ill-treatment and death in respect of both civilians,4 includinginternees, and members of the Armed Forces as prisoners of war. Claims alreadyregistered by individuals with His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom on&apos;a voluntary basis and with the Governments of Colonial and Protected territories in respect of these categories are estimated to amount to several hundred millionpounds.4. It was originally the intention that such claims should be pursued againstthe Japanese Government. This would require a clause in the peace treaty obligingthe Japanese Government to meet claims of the categories referred to above whichmight be made by the nationals of any of the forty-nine States at war with Japan.5. As regards British property situated in Japan, His Majesty&apos;s government intend to continue to press for its restoration intact, and where this is impossiblefor proper compensation which could of course be paid in yen.6. As regards other claims it is necessary to take into account Japan&apos;s capacity to pay in foreign exchange sums of the magnitude involved. The present positionis that Japan remains a financial liability to the Allied Powers. Essential importsof food and raw materials for Japan have cost the United States Government littleshort of $1 million a day for the last five years. On any realistic estimate therefore,Japan would be quite unable to find the very large sums in foreign exchangerequired to meet all the individual claims which would be made.7. His Majesty&apos;s Government have the deepest sympathy with those of allraces who suffered at the hands of the Japanese, particularly with the relatives ofthose who died and all those who suffered injury or ill-treatment. But in the cir-cumstances they have reluctantly reached the conclusion that it is not practicable topress for the inclusion in a peace treaty with Japan of an obligation to pay individualclaims for loss of and damage to property situated outside Japan and for personal injury and ill-treatment wherever suffered.8. It may be suggested that, on the analogy of the action taken by theUnited States Government, Japanese assets now held in the United Kingdom andits dependent territories should be applied to meet these claims. HonourableMembers will recall that, as was stated in the House on 28th April, 1949, the esti-mated net value of Japanese assets in the United Kingdom is somewhere between one and one and a quarter million pounds sterling. It goes without saying that this sum would be wholly inadequate to meet even the claims already registered in theUnited Kingdom. Japanese assets held in British Colonial and Protected territories would be wholly inadequate to meet claims in those territories.9. In this situation His Majesty&apos;s Government have considered to what extentindividual claims in respect of damage to property or hardship or personal injurycaused by Japanese war-time acts could be met from the United Kingdom Ex-chequer. This Government, like their war-time predecessors, have taken the viewthat it would be out of the question for the State to attempt to recompense everyform of loss or hardship suffered by its citizens as a result of the war. The generalpolicy adopted with regard to United Kingdom residents has been to provide fortheir rehabilitation. To this end, provision has been made for certain payments in respect of war damage or loss of personal chattels. Illnesses have been treatedand pensions have been awarded for residual disablement or death resulting frompersonal injury. Certain United Kingdom residents who have suffered damage to private property or personal injury at Japanese hands are already eligible for awardson this basis under existing schemes e.g., Far Eastern Private Chattels Scheme;special provisions analogous to the United Kingdom Personal Injuries (Civilians)Scheme; and the Ministry of Pensions warrants relating to pensions, &amp;c, for members of the Armed Forces. Special steps were taken, and are still being taken,to secure the rehabilitation of those whose health was affected by the appalling
sufferings which they endured in captivity in Japanese hands. This was a clearduty&apos; owed to these ex-captives by their more fortunate fellow citizens. But it is adifferent matter to provide out of United Kingdom taxes some financial benefit inaddition to rehabilitation, treatment and pensions, and it would clearly be difficultto make any distinction for this purpose between the victims of Japanese war-timeacts and those who have suffered as the result of the action of other enemies of HisMajesty&apos;s Government during the recent war. Honourable Members will recall thestatement made on behalf of the Government in this matter by my honourablefriend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for War in the debate on 13thJune 1950. After very careful consideration the Government have decided that itwould be wrong to lay upon the United Kingdom taxpayer the additional burdenentailed in the payment from public funds of awards in respect of individual claimsbeyond those already provided.10. I recognise that these decisions may cause some disappointment to many.His Majesty&apos;s Government have, however, decided that it would be preferable tomake a public statement of the present position and the reasons for their decisions in order not to sustain hopes which they can see no prospect of fulfilling.
