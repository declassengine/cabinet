l(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERT-Y-OF HIS BRITANNIC MA.ESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(51) 72 , COPY NO. 39TH MARCH, 1951CABINETTHE COUNCIL OF europe memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe purpose of this paper is to review the situation which has arisen in the Council of Europe in connection with the revision of the Statute and to putforward the line of policy to be followed by the United Kingdom representative at the forthcoming meeting of the Committee of Ministers, which will beheld in Paris on 16th and 17th March.Re commendations2. I ask my colleagues to agree :-(i)        that His Majesty&apos;s Governments attitude to the various proposalsfor the amendments of the Statute should be based on the policy set out in paragraph 5 below;(ii)        that, notwithstanding the provisions of the Statute, the UnitedKingdom representative at the forthcoming meeting should endeavour to secure that the Committee of Ministers do not amend the Statute except by unanimous agreement;(iii)        that, if necessary, the United Kingdom representative shouldmake a statement at the Paris meeting drawing attention tothe serious consequences which might result if the Committeeof Ministers adopted amendments to the Statute to which HisMajesty&apos;s Government were opposed;(iv)       that, while His Majesty&apos;s Government would not wish to withdraw from the Council of Europe for the reasons given in paragraph 17below, our position would have to be reconsidered if amendments to the Statute were, in fact, adopted in spite of our opposition.The Background3. At its last meeting in Rome in November, 1950, the Committee ofMinisters decided to set up a Committee of Government Officials to examinethe whole question of constitutional revision, taking into account the various recommendations made by the Consultative Assembly for amending theStatute.   The officials were instructed to prepare a report for submission to the Committee of Ministers not later than 1st March.4. The proposed amendments to the Statute examined by the officialsfell into four broad categories:-(i)       those of the Assembly&apos;s recommendations which were specificallyreferred to the officials by the Committee of Ministers;
(ii)  .    proposals for constitutional revision emanating from member governments;(iii)       suggestions put forward by the Secretary-General;  and(iv)       further recommendations made by the Assembly in November,1950, at the second part of last year&apos;s session, i. e. after themeeting of the Committee of Ministers in Rome.The last category included a &quot;Protocol for the Revision of the Statute&quot; basedon proposals made by Mr. R. W.G. Mackay, Member of Parliament forReading North, and sponsored by a special committee of the Assemblyunder the Chairmanship of Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe.5. The instructions given to the United Kingdom representative on the Committee of Officials were based on the policy approved by theCabinet in October last (C. M. (50) 68th Conclusions, Minute 2).   The broadlines of this policy are as follows:-(i)        We cannot agree to any fundamental changes in thecharacter of the Council of Europe as expressed in theStatute in its present form.(ii)       We are concerned, in particular, to preserve the purelyconsultative character of the Assembly.(iii)        We consider that defence in any of its aspects should remain outside the scope of the Council of Europe.c(iv)       We are prepared to agree to the creation of specialisedauthorities under the aegis of the Council of Europe, thuspermitting member Governments who wish to do so to enter into closer forms of association among themselves.(v)       We are also prepared to agree to certain improvements in theStatute designed to enable the Council of Europe in its existingform to function more effectively.6. Broadly speaking, the policy outlined at (i), (ii) and (iii) above appearsto run counter to the views of other member Governments, who (judging fromthe attitude of their repre-s-representatives in the Committee of Officials) considerthat the Assembly should play a greater part in the discussion and management of European affairs and that its powers should be increased at the expenseof the Committee of Ministers.   These Governments are apparently preparedto accept in principle the amendments to the Statute advocated by theAssembly.   Nevertheless, the United Kingdom representative was ableto secure the rejection of some of the more objectionable recommendationsof the Assembly, including the so-called Mackay Protocol (see paragraph above) which seeks to confer on the Council of Europe legislative and executive powers of a far-reaching character.Report of the Committee of Government Officials7. The Committee of Officials has now produced its report (attached at annex) which has been submitted to member Governments and sent to thePresident of the Consultative Assembly for his comments.   Both the report and the Assembly&apos;s comments will be considered by the Committee ofMinisters at its forthcoming meeting.
8, The report of the officials is divided into three parts.   Thefirst two parts set out the points on which the officials were able to reachunanimous agreement (subject in certain cases to alternative texts) andtherefore shows what consensus of opinion exists among member Govern-ments on the revision of the Statute.   The third part lists the proposals onwhich it proved impossible to reach unanimous agreement.The Problem9. So far as His Majesty&apos;s Government are concerned, the first and second parts of this report present no difficulties.   The recommendations which the officials have made for amending the Statute are in accordancewith our policy of improving the general machinery of the Council ofEurope and permitting the setting up of Specialised Authorities closely linked to the Council of Europe.   We do not have to join those SpecialisedAuthorities, and it has been made clear that we should probably not do so,though we would be willing to consider in each specific case whether, andif so how, we could be associated with the work of the Authority.10. The third part of the report is, however, likely to cause us grave difficulties.   The proposals for amending the Statute on which the officials were unable to reach agreement relate to such matters as the competence of the Council of Europe to deal with the political aspects of defence and the granting of additional powers to the Consultative Assembly at the expenseof the Committee of Ministers.   Our representative, of course, opposedthese proposals, which would alter the present character of the Councilof Europe and might well pave the way for changes of a more fundamentalcharacter;  but most of the other representatives were willing to accept them.11. It now rests with the Committee of Ministers to decide what actionshall be taken on the controversial amendments.   Hitherto, the Committeeof Ministers has preferred to work on a basis of common agreement, even where this is not required under the Statute.   This has created an atmosphere of Western European solidarity which has been one of the most satisfactoryfeatures of earlier meetings.   If this practice is continued, as I sincerelyhope will be the case, none of the amendments to the Statute to which we are opposed will be accepted.12. We must, however, face the fact that the Statute itself containsprovisions for the amendment of specific Articles.   There are, in fact, two categories of amendments:-(i)        amendments to five Articles of fundamental importance which require the unanimous approval of the Committee of Ministers;and(ii)        amendments to all other Articles and the insertion of newArticles which require a two-thirds majority only.Moreover, the Statute provides that a Protocol embodying amendmentscomes into effect after it has been ratified by two-thirds of the member governments.   It therefore follows that, if the strict provisions of thev-tatute were applied, amendments which we are unwilling to accept could beadopted and brought into effect in spite of our determined opposition.
E. B,Foreign Office, S. V/. 1. ,9TH MARCH, 1951.13. Most of the amendments on which the officials were unable toreach agreement (including the competence of the Council of Europe todeal with the political aspects of defence) can be adopted by the Committeeof Ministers by a two-thirds majority only.   It is clear from the deliberations of the Committee of Officials that these amendments are supported by two-thirds of the member Governments.   Indeed, the UnitedKingdom representative frequently found himself in a minority of one.Policy to be pursued at the next meeting of the Committee of Ministers14. It is possible that some of the members of the Committee ofMinisters, under pressure from members of the political parties to whichthey belong, may insist that the strict provisions of the Statute shouldbe applied and that all amendments which receive the statutory majorityshould be adopted.   The French representative in the Committee of Officialshas already advocated this course of action which met with some support from the other delegations.15. I am therefore taking steps to bring this question to the notice ofCount Sforza and Monsieur Schuman whose attitude will probably be decisive.I shall take the line that, in a matter so important for the future of theCouncil of Europe as the amendment of the Statute, it is essential that theCommittee of Ministers should adhere to its existing practice of reachingdeci sions by unanimous agreement.   It must, however, be admitted that our case is weak since we have accepted the Statute in its present form,including the provisions for its amendment.   We could, moreover, be accused of trying to create a situation in which we would, in effect, be able toexercise a right of veto.16. It will be necessary to take a firm line at the Paris meeting in orderto ensure that amendments to which we are opposed are not adopted by a statutory majority.   Even so, it is by no means certain that we shallsucceed in persuading the Committee of Ministers to take unanimousdecisions.   Thus a situation may arise in the near future as a result ofwhich we may have to reconsider our general policy towards the Councilof Europe.17. It is in my opinion important that, as far as possible, we shouldnot be forced into a position over the revision of the Statute in which we wouldhave no alternative but to withdraw from the Council of Europe.   Thereasons which have consistently inhibited us from contemplating such a stepare still valid.   The first is the low state of European morale and the dangerof undermining an institution to which many continental people, who have lost confidence in their own countries and themselves, pin their hopes.The second is the fact that the Council of Europe is still the only inter-national political arenaxin which the Germans play a part.   Lastly, ourpresence in the Council of Europe acts as a brake on the extremefederalists and enables us to guide the Council of Europe along more realistic and tiseful paths.
36fiTHIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTANNEXCOUNCIL OF EUROPEREPORT OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE REVISION OF THESTATUTEINTRODUCTIONAt its Sixth Session in Rome in November 1950, the Committee of ministers decided to set up a Committee of Senior Officials to examine the various recom-mendations made by the Consultative Assembly for amending the Statute, and improving the general machinery, of the Council of Europe. The Committee was instructed to complete its task and submit a report to the Committee of Ministersnot later than 1st March, 1951. The text of the relevant Resolution is set out at appendix A.2. The Committee has held three sessions under the chairmanship of M. F.Cavailetti, representative of the Italian Government. It decided at the outset ofits discussions not to limit its mandate to the consideration of the recommendationsreferred to above, but to take into account all proposals for constitutional revision,irrespective of their origin. As a result, the recommendations examined by theCommittee fell into four broad categories:  (1) the Assembly recommendations covered by the Resolution at Appendix A;(2) proposals for constitutional revision emanating from member Govern-ments;(3) suggestions put forward by the Secretary-General; and(4) recommendations and proposals made by the Assembly in November 1950,at the second part of last year&apos;s Ordinary Session, i.e., after the meetingof the Committee of Ministers in Rome.3. In undertaking its task, the Committee was fully conscious of the need toobtain the views of the Assembly on the questions under discussion in so far as this was compatible with intergovernmental discussions of a confidential nature and the constitutional practice of member Governments. A meeting was arranged between a sub-committee consisting of three members of the Committee and aspecial delegation of the Consultative Assembly. This meeting took place inParis on 10th February under the chairmanship of M. de Menthpn, ActingPresident of the Consultative Assembly. The views of the Assembly representatives and the clarifications which they were able to furnish on the various recommenda-tions under consideration were of great value to the Committee and have been carefully borne in mind in the course of subsequent discussions.4. In order to achieve complete co-operation between the two organs of theCouncil of Europe in a task as fundamental as the revision of the Statute, theCommittee has decided, with the full approval of member Governments, to transmitthis report to the President of the Consultative Assembly, at the same time as itis submitted to member Governments, in order to obtain the Assembly&apos;s comments.These comments will be considered by the Committee of Ministers at its next meeting in conjunction with this report.5. Since the Committee of Ministers has hitherto reached its decisions on abasis of common agreement, the Committee of Officials decided that it would not take votes on the various proposals under consideration but would endeavour toreach unanimous decisions; in other words, it would attempt to discover whatconsensus of opinion existed among member Governments on the revision ofthe Statute. Nevertheless, it recognised that the Committee of Ministers was under no obligation to continue this practice when it came to consider this report and that40258: -: -   v&quot; - &apos; 7 &apos;v 1* .,
the Ministers might well decide to apply the strict provisions of Article 20 to all or some of the proposals for revising the Statute.6. In the course of the CommitteeV discussions, it became clear that thereare various schools of thought among member Governments on the future structure and functions of the Council of Europe. Some member Governments are willingto give the Assembly a greater liberty of action and to extend its competence.They accept in principle the amendments to the Statute advocated by the assembly which, they consider, should play a greater part in the discussion and management of. European affairs. Other member Governments maintain that the assembly should remain purely consultative in character, and feel that the present Statuteprovides a satisfactory basis for the functioning of the Council of Europe, although they are by no means opposed to amendments, designed to improve the machineryof the Council, in the light of the experience of the past two years.7. In spite of these different points: of view, it was clear from the general discussion which took place at the first session of the Committee that all delegationswere fully aware that the Council of Europe had an important role to play in european affairs and that the Specialised Authorities, in particular, provided a fieldin which the Council could make a major contribution to the integration of Europe.8. The existence of the two schools of thought inevitably prevented theCommittee from reaching unanimous decisions on all the proposals which it dis-cussed. Nevertheless, agreement was reached on the majority of the questionsunder discussion.9.   Two of the questions before the Committee call for special comment:  (a) Protocol for the Amendment of the Statute adopted by a Special Committeeof the Assembly on 23rd December, 1950.The Committee in the course of two of its sessions gave carefulconsideration to the Protocol. It fully realised the importance of this document, the far-reaching effects of its provisions and the time andstudy which must necessarily have been entailed in its preparation.Certain delegations were prepared to accept the Protocol in principlesubject to modifications in the light of a more detailed examinationOthers, while recognising that the Protocol opened up new horizonsfor the Council of Europe, considered that the guarantees designed to allay the anxieties of certain Governments (in particular the retentionof the unanimity rule for the decisions of the Committee of Ministers)might, in practice, prevent the Council from making effective use of thenew procedure envisaged, which would have the result of disappointingEuropean public opinion.The Committee had, however, to take account of the categoricalopposition of certain Governments to any proposal for altering the consultative character of the Assembly. It therefore came to theconclusion that it would not be advisable at this stage to depart fromthe fundamental principles on which the present Statute was based, butto introduce instead those improvements which were generally recog-nised as necessary in order to perfect the Statute in its present form.Certain delegations considered, however, that when a decision was finally taken on the questions referred to in paragraph 10 (b) below, itmight be necessary to re-examine the Protocol.(b) Relations between the Council of Europe and the O.E.E.C.Among the problems which the Committee was instructed to studywas that of the relations between the Council of Europe and theO.E.E.C. The Committee was informed, however, that the questionof the fusion of the two organisations was the subject of a memorandum submitted by the Swedish Government to the Governments of the member States of the O.E.E.C. and that this is likely to be referred toa special Committee of the O.E.E.C. for examination.Moreover, the question of liaison between the two organisations isalso being studied by the special committees of liaison appointed bythem. These Committees will be submitting a report to the Committeeof Ministers and to the Council of O.E.E.C. in due course.
. In these circumstances, the Committee considered that it could notusefully deal with this question. It recognised, however, that relationsbetween the Council of Europe and the O.E.E.C. were covered in ageneral way by the, provisions of the proposed new article on relationswith international organisations (see Chapter II, paragraph 28).10. In approving this report, the Committee decided that the most convenientmethod of setting out the conclusions would be to divide the report into threesections as follows:   t%Chapter I. Lists the proposals on which agreement was reached and recom-mends the action Which the Committee of Ministers should take:        vChapter II. Lists the proposals on which agreement was reached in principle and submits alternative texts for consideration by the Committee ofMinisters.Chapter III. Lists the proposals on which it was not possible to reach agreement.40258
CHAPTER I.-QUESTIONS ON WHICH AGREEMENT WAS REACHEDil. Admission of New Members Articles 4 and 5 of the Statute. (Recbinmen--     datiori 51) &apos; &apos; &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;The Committee considered that it would not be compatible with the functionsof the Consultative Assembly to allow it to exercise the right of making a decisionon this question. It recommended, however, that the Committee of ministers should accept the principle that the Assembly should be consulted before new members were admitted and before any decision was taken to request the with-drawal Of an existing Member.It was therefore proposed r &apos;    to add at the end of Articles 4 and 5 (a) of the Statute the following sentence:  &quot; The Committee of Ministers shall consult the Consultative Assemblybefore issuing such an invitation.&quot;to amend Article 8 as follows:  To insert after the first sentence &quot; The Committee of Ministers shall consult the Consultative Assemblybefore issuing such a request.&quot;12. Powers of the Committee of Ministers Article 15 of the Statute.  (Recommen-dation 10)The Committee recognised that the adoption of Recommendation .10 was likelyto give rise to constitutional difficulties. It proposed, however, that the Council ofEurope should adopt a procedure similar to that in operation for the ratification of Conventions adopted by the International Labour Organisation. It therefore proposed the addition to Article 15 of the Statute of a paragraph (c) to the following effect:  &quot; (c) The conclusions of the Committee may, where appropriate, take the formof a convention or agreement. In such a case the following provisions shall apply: -(i) The convention or agreement shall be submitted by the Secretary-General to all Members for ratification;(ii) each Member undertakes that within one year of such submission,or, where this is impossible owing to exceptional circumstances,within eighteen months, the question of ratification of the conven-tion or agreement shall be brought before the competent authority or authorities in its country;(iii) the instruments of ratification shall be deposited with the Secretary-General;(iv) The convention or agreement shall only be binding on such members as have ratified it.In addition, it would be necessary to add to Article 20 (a) (1) the words:&quot;.... and (c).&quot;13. Establishment of the Agenda of the Consultative Assembly Article 23 of theStatute. (Recommendation 51)The Committee recommended that the new text of Article 23 proposed bythe Consultative Assembly should be accepted as the first paragraph of this article.The present paragraphs (b) and (c) should be retained with appropriate amend-ments.  The Article as revised would read as follows:  (a) The Consultative Assembly may discuss and make Recommendations upon any matter within the aim and scope of the Council of Europe as defined in Chapter I; it shall also discuss and may make Recommendationsupon any matter referred to it by the Committee of Ministers with a request for its opinion.
,5 368(b) The Assembly shall draw up its Agenda in accordance with the provisionsof paragraph (a) above. In so doing it shall have regard to the workof other European inter-governmental organisations to which some or all of the Members of the Council are parties.(c) The President of the Assembly shall decide, in case of doubt,, whether-anyquestion raised in the course of the Session is within the Agenda of theAssembly.&quot; ; &apos;  &apos;   , 1    %14. Appointment of Representatives to the Assembly--Article 25 of the Statute(Recommendation 54, paragraph 4 (d))The Committee recommended that the Committee of Ministers should approvethis Recommendation. It consequently proposed that the first sentence of para--graph (a) of Article 25 should be replaced by the following text: - &quot; The Consultative Assembly shall consist of representatives of each member elected by its Parliament or. appointed in such manner as that Parlia-ment shall decide, subject, however, to the right of the Governments to makeany additional appointments necessary when the Parliaments are not in session.&quot; &apos;15. Number of Representatives to the Assembly for each Member State. Article 26of the Statute :The Committee proposed to complete Article 26 by inserting the followingin accordance with the alphabetical order:  German Federal Republic ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 18Greece        ......      ...      ...      ...              ... 6Iceland        ..................... 3Saar            ..................      ... 3Turkey        .........      .........      ... 8It is also proposed to replace the words &quot; Irish Republic&quot; by the word&quot; Ireland.&quot;The German delegation proposed that the words &quot; German Federal Republic &quot;should be replaced by the word &quot;Germany.&quot; Certain delegations reserved their positions on this proposal.The Turkish delegate informed the Committee of the intention of his Govern-ment to request an increase in the number of seats allotted to his counry from 8to 10. The other delegations took note of this statement. The Netherlands dele-gate, however, stated that if the request of the Turkish delegate was taken intoconsideration his Government would request an increase in the number of theNetherlands delegates from 6 to 7. The Danish and Swedish delegates observedthat they could only agree to the request of the Turkish delegate on condition that other Governments did not make similar requests for an increase in the number oftheir representatives.16. Extraordinary Sessions of the Assembly Article 34 of the Statute (Recom-mendation 13)The Committee was unable to adopt the recommendation of the Assemblyrelating to extraordinary sessions of the Assembly in its original form; it agreed,however, to recommend that the following amended text of Article 34 beadopted:  (1) &quot; Whenever the President of the Consultative Assembly requests theconvocation of an extraordinary Session of the Assembly, such requestshall be referred to the Joint Committee.(2) The Joint Committee shall examine the request and, if it finds that an extraordinary session should be convoked, shall submit its recommenda-tion to this effect, specifying the time and place of the session, to theCommittee of Ministers.(3) Unless, within such period as may be fixed by the Joint Committee, morethan one-third of the representatives on the Committee of Ministers haveexpressed their opposition to this recommendation, the President of the consultative Assembly may convoke the extraordinary session.
(b) The Assembly shall draw up its Agenda in accordance with the provisionsof paragraph (a) above. In so doing it shall have regard to the workof other European inter-goyernmental organisations to. which some or all of the Members of the Council are parties.(c) The President of the Assembly shall decide, in case of doubt, whether-anyquestion raised in the course of the Session is within the Agenda of the- Assembly.&quot; .&quot;&apos;   .    &quot;       &apos; &apos;14. Appointment of Representatives to the Assembly--Article 25 of the Statute(Recommendation 54, paragraph 4 (d))The Committee recommended that the Committee of Ministers should approvethis Recommendation. It consequently proposed that the first sentence of para--graph (a) of Article 25 should be replaced by the following text:  &quot; The Consultative Assembly shall consist of representatives of each member elected by its Parliament or,appointed in such manner as that Parlia-ment shall decide, subject, however, to the right of the Governments to makeany additional appointments necessary when the Parliaments are not in session.&quot;15. Number of Representatives to the Assembly for each Member State Article 26of the Statute :The Committee proposed to complete Article 26 by inserting the followingin accordance with the alphabetical order:  German Federal Republic ...     ... -   ...     ...      ... 18Greece ......      ...              ...      ...      ... 6Iceland        ......      ......      ......... 3Saar            ..................      ... 3Turkey        .........      ...      .....       ... 8.&apos; &apos; It is also proposed to replace the words &quot;Irish Republic&quot; by the word&quot;Ireland.&quot;The German delegation proposed that the words &quot; German Federal Republic &quot;should be replaced by the word &quot;Germany.&quot; Certain delegations reserved their positions on this proposal.The Turkish delegate informed the Committee of the intention of his Govern-ment to request an increase in the number of seats allotted to his counry from 8to 10. The other delegations took note of this statement. The Netherlands dele-gate, however, stated that if the request of the Turkish delegate was taken intoconsideration his Government would request an increase in the number of theNetherlands delegates from 6 to 7. The Danish and Swedish delegates observedthat they could only agree to the request of the Turkish delegate on condition that other Governments did not make similar requests for an increase in the number oftheir representatives.16. Extraordinary Sessions of the Assembly Article 34 of the Statute (Recom-mendation 13)The Committee was unable to adopt the recommendation of the Assemblyrelating to extraordinary sessions of the Assembly in its original form; it agreed,however, to recommend that the following amended text of Article 34 beadopted:  (1) &quot; Whenever the President of the Consultative Assembly requests theconvocation of an extraordinary Session of the Assembly, such requestshall be referred to the Joint Committee.(2) The Joint Committee shall examine the request and, if it finds that an extraordinary session should be convoked, shall submit its recommenda-tion to this effect, specifying the time and place of the session, to theCommittee of Ministers.(3) Unless, within such period as may be fixed by the Joint Committee, morethan one-third of the representatives on the Committee of Ministers haveexpressed their opposition to this recommendation, the President of the consultative Assembly may convoke the extraordinary session.
(4) The Committee of Ministers may convoke an extraordinary session of the&apos;! Consultative Assembly at such time and place as the Committee, withthe concurrence of the President of the Assembly, shall decide.&quot;17. The Joint CommitteeThe Committee agreed that it would be desirable to give statutory recognition to the existence of the Joint Committee by the insertion of special provisions in theStatute. It therefore recommended that a new Chapter should be inserted in theStatute to the following effect:  &quot;Chapter VI. The Joint CommitteeArticle 1The Joint Committee is the organ of co-ordination of the Council of Europe.Without prejudice to the respective rights of the Committee of Ministers and the consultative Assembly, the functions of the Joint Committee shall be, inparticular:  . (a) to examine the problems which are common to the two other organs;(b) to draw the attention of those two organs to those questions which appearto be of particular interest to the Council of Europe;ic) to make proposals for the draft Agenda of the sessions of the Committeeof Ministers and of the Consultative Assembly;(d) to examine and promote means of giving practical effect to the Recom-mendations adopted by one or other of those two organs.Article 2(a) The Joint Committee shall be composed in principle of twelve members,five of whom shall be representatives of the Committee of Ministers,and seven of whom shall be representatives of the consultative assembly, the latter number to include the President of the consultative assembly, who shall-be a member ex offtcio. The number of members.; may be increased by agreement between the Committee of Ministers andthe Assembly. Nevertheless the Committee of Ministers shall, at itsdiscretion, be entitled to increase by one or two the number of its repre-sentatives on the Joint Committee.(b) The Committee of Ministers and the Consultative Assembly shall be free to choose their own method of selecting their representatives on theJoint Committee.(c) The Secretary-General shall be entitled to attend the meetings of the JointCommittee in an advisory capacity.Article 3(a) The President of the Consultative Assembly shall be the Chairman of thes Joint Committee.: (b) No proceedings of the Committee shall be regarded as valid unless a quorum is present consisting of three of the representatives of the Com-mittee of Ministers and five of the representatives of the consultative assembly.(c) The conclusions of the Joint Committee shall be reached without voting.: :   (d) The meetings of the Joint Committee shall be convened by the chairman and shall take place as often as is necessary and in particular before andafter the sessions of the Committee of Ministers and of the consultative assembly.(e) Subject to the foregoing, the Joint Committee may adopt its oWn Rules ofProcedure.&quot; - ! :&apos;: As consequential changes in Article 10, it would be necessary to add; after thewords &quot; (ii) the Consultative Assembly,&quot; the words &quot; (iii) the Joint Committee.&quot;Also in the last paragraph of Article 10j to delete the word &quot; both.&quot;
18. Number of Deputy Secretaries-General Article 2d on StatusThe Committee agreed to amend paragraph (a) of Article 36 so as to permit the appointment of more than one Deputy Secretary-General. The first two para-graphs of the revised article would then read as follows:  &quot;The Secretariat shall consist of a Secretary-General and such DeputySecretaries-General and other staff as may be required.&quot; The Secretary-General and Deputy Secretaries-General shall be appointedby the Consultative&apos;Assembly on the recommendation of the Committeeof Ministers.&quot; :..::\:- , ;19. Finance-Article 38 of the StatuteAs a result of a question raised by the delegates of Greece and Turkey aboutthe adjustment of the contributions of Member States to the expenses of the Council,the Committee came to the conclusion that such adjustments would not involve an amendment to Article 38 of the Statute. The Governments concerned could,if they so desired, transmit memoranda to the other Member States requestingadjustments in their contributions.20. Financial Control Article 38 of the StatuteIn order to apply to the Council of Europe the same financial arrangements as are in force in certain international organisations, the Committee recommended theaddition to Article 38 of a paragraph (e) to the following effect: -&quot; The Secretary-General shall also submit to the Committee of Ministersan estimate of the expenditure to which the implementation of each of therecommendations presented to the Committee would give rise. Any resolution the implementation of which requires additional expenditure shall not beconsidered as adopted by the Committee of Ministers unless the Committeehas also approved the corresponding estimates for such additional expenditure.&quot;21. The creation of a Ministerial post for European Affairs (Recommendation 9)The Committee recommended that the Committee of Ministers should adoptthe following Resolution:  &quot; The Committee Of Ministers,Having regard to the Recommendation, of the Consultative Assembly forthe creation, within the Governments of Member States, of a Ministerial postfor European Affairs,Resolves:Each Member may, subject to the terms of Article 14 of the Statute,nominate a Minister, Secretary or Under-Secretary of State, who shall beresponsible for the affairs of the Council of Europe in his Government.&quot;22. Appointment of Senior Officials responsible for the preparatory work of theCouncil of Europe (Recommendation 11)The Committee recommended that the Committee of Ministers should adoptthe following Resolution: -&quot; The Committee of Ministers,Having regard to the Recommendation of the Assembly for the appoint-ment, in the Ministries concerned, of Senior Officials responsible for thepreparatory work of the Council of Europe,Resolves:Each Member may appoint in the Ministry or Ministries concerned a seniorofficial who shall be responsible for the preparatory work of the Council of\    Europe with regard to questions which are the concern of that particularministerial department.&quot;The Committee agreed that no further action was necessary on the second partof Recommendation 11, since it had already been implemented:-&quot;In order to facilitate liaison between its Government and the Secretariat-General of the Council, each Member may, if it so desires, appoint an officialto act as its permanent Representative at the seat of the Council of Europe.&quot;
23. Reference back to the appropriate Committee qf the Assembly of RecommendarHons that are not approved by the Committee of Ministers (Recommehda-tibri I5p4 -       t-::y:s,;h-:J&apos;&apos;txM &apos;j:xM::-ttwt:Mm &apos;ftThe Committee recommended that a new Article be inserted in the Rules ofProcedure of the Committee of Ministers, to the following effect:- -w&apos;&quot; Where a Recommendation of the Consultative Assembly is only partiallyacceptable to the Committee of Ministers, the latter shall refer it back to thePresident of the Assembly for further consideration and shall at the same timeappend its comments.&quot;24. Relations with the Brussels Treaty Organisation (Recommendation 19)The Committee recommended that the Committee of Ministers should transmitRecommendation 19 to the five signatory Powers of the Brussels Treaty of17th March, 1948. It noted, however, that these Powers were already studying thisquestion in advance of any decision by the Committee of Ministers.25. Liaison with the countries of North America (Recommendation 20)The Committee noted that there was a difference between the French and english texts of paragraph 4 of this recommendation. According to the Frenchtext &quot; une liaison organique &quot; should be established between the European Organi-sations and the countries of North America; the English text spoke of a &quot; closeliaison &quot; between those countries and the European organisations.The Committee recommended that the Committee of Ministers should adoptRecommendation 20 in the sense of the English text, on the understanding that theinformation to be communicated to the Assembly in the last paragraph should belimited to a general statement in the Report of the Committee of Ministers underArticle 19 of the Statute.The Committee therefore suggested that the Committee of Ministers should adopt a Resolution in the following terms:  &quot; The Committee of Ministers takes note of Recommendation 20, adoptedby the Consultative Assembly on 18th August, 1950, and affirms its desire toestablish close liaison between existing European Organisations and thecountries of North America. It suggests that the Consultative assembly should study the terms and conditions of such liaison and give the Committeeits opinion on this question.&quot;26. Liaison with Overseas Territories or Countries (Recommendation 50)The Committee recommended that the Committee of Ministers should transmitRecommendation 50 to the Governments of the Member States concerned, while at the same time informing the Consultative Assembly that certain measures relatingto that Recommendation had in fact been taken in advance of the approval of theCommittee of Ministers.The Netherlands Government, in particular, had already drawn the attentionof the Government of Indonesia to the Recommendation in question.The Government of the United Kingdom was in agreement with the principleof consultation with the countries of the British Commonwealth and with theproposal that the latter should send observers to the Sessions of the consultative assembly. Indeed, it had already informed the Commonwealth Governments that,while the question of sending observers was for them to decide, the United kingdom would welcome their presence at Strasbourg.27. Written Questions Rule 48 of the Rules of Procedure of the ConsultativeAssemblyThe Committee, to whom this question was submitted by one of the delegations,recommended that the Committee of Ministers should adopt the following pro-cedure with regard to written questions submitted to it by Representatives to theAssembly:  &quot; Such questions should first be examined by the Ministers&apos; representatives who meet immediately before the sessions of the Committee of Ministers,,These Representatives should then determine which questions should beincluded in the Agenda of the Committee of Ministers, and. should decide what other action should be. taken. This procedure might be modified in the light&apos; of experience.&quot;
CHAPTER H.-QUESTIONS ON WHICH AGREEMENT WAS reached in PRINCIPLE, BUT NOT ON THE TEXTS TO BE ADOPTED28. Relations   with   Intergovernmental   Organisations.   (Recommendation   55,paragraphs 1 and 2)The Committee recognised the importance of this Recommendation, whichshould enable the Council of Europe to develop its activities in close co-operationwith intergovernmental and non-governmental international organisations whose work includes questions which are within the competence of the Council of Europe.The Committee therefore recommended that the Committee of ministers should adopt the four articles below, which might constitute a new Chapter XIof the Statute &quot; Chapter XI Relations with Intergovernmental and Non-GovernmentalInternational Organisations&quot; Article 1The Committee of Ministers may, on behalf of the Council of Europe,conclude with any intergovernmental organisation agreements on matters which are within the competence of the Council, such agreements to define theterms on which such an organisation shall be brought into relationship withthe Council of Europe.&quot; Article 2The Council of Europe, or any of its organs, shall be authorised to exercise such functions within the scope of the Council of Europe as may be entrusted to it by other European intergovernmental organisations. The Committee ofMinisters shall conclude any agreements necessary for this purpose.&quot; Article 3The agreements referred to in Article 1 may provide, inter alia (a) that the Council shall take appropriate steps to obtain regular reports from the organisations in question and to send them reports in itsturn;(b) that the Council shall give opinions and render such services as maybe requested by these organisations;[(c) that the Council shall make arrangements for representatives of these organisations to participate without vote in its deliberations andfor its own representatives to participate in the deliberations of these organisations.].&quot;Article 4The Committee of Ministers may, on behalf of the Council of Europe,make suitable arrangements for consultation with international non-govern-mental organisations which deal with matters which are within the competence of the Council of Europe.&quot;With regard to paragraph (c) of Article 3 above, the Committee was unable toreach complete agreement.29.   Specialised authorities (Recommendations 1, 4 and 52)At its session in Rome, the Committee of Ministers had already accepted inprinciple Recommendations 1 and 4, concerning Specialised Authorities. TheCommittee therefore concentrated on considering the provisions which should beincluded in the Statute of the Council of Europe to make possible the applicationof the principle set out in these Recommendations.The Committee considered that it was necessary to distinguish two categories of Specialised Authorities: those due to the initiative of the Council of europe and those set up, outside the Council of Europe, by the Member States among themselves and on their own initiative.The Committee recommends the adoption of the following Articles. their object is on the one hand, to stress, in accordance with Recommendation 1, theimportance for the unification of Europe of the creation of Specialised Authorities;and on the other hand to ensure that such Authorities should become a factor in40258c
the integration, of Europe by denning the terms and conditions for the attachmentof the Specialised Authorities to the Council of Europe and by giving the Councilof Europe the task of ensuring co-ordination between the various authorities.The text of the Articles proposed by the Committee was unanimouslyapproved, with the exception of a few points on which the Committee can onlysuggest alternative versions, which are entered in parentheses.&quot; Chapter X-Specialised Authorities&quot;Article 1(a) The Council of Europe may take the initiative in instituting negotiations between Members with a view to the creation of European SpecialisedAuthorities, each with its own competence in the [politica], economic,social, cultural, legal, administrative or other related field.(b) Each Member shall remain free to adhere or not to adhere to each suchEuropean Specialised Authority.&quot; Article 2(a) If Member States set up among themselves, on their own initiative,European Specialised Authorities, these shall [may] be brought intorelationship with the Council of Europe, after the interests of theEuropean community as a whole have been taken into account.(b) Each Member shall remain free to adhere to each such SpecialisedAuthority or to resign therefrom subject to the conditions laid downin the Statute of such Authority.&quot; Article 3(a) The Committee of Ministers shall [may] invite each Authority to submit to it a periodic report on its activities.(b) Insofar as any agreement setting up a Specialised Authority provides fora parliamentary body, this body shall [may] be invited to submit aperiodic report to the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe.&quot; Article 4(a) The conditions under which a Specialised Authority shall be brought intorelationship with the Council may be determined by special agree-ments concluded between the Council and the Specialised authority concerned.   Such agreements may cover inter alia:  (i) Reciprocal representation and, if the question arises, the appropriateforms of integration between the organs Of the Council of europe and those of the Specialised Authority.(ii) Exchanges of information, documents and statistical data.(iii) The presentation of reports by the Specialised Authority to theCouncil of Europe and of recommendations of the Council ofEurope to the Specialised Authority.(iv) Arrangements  concerning  staff  and   administrative   technical,budgetary and financial services.(b) Such agreements shall be negotiated and concluded on behalf of theCouncil of Europe by the Committee of Ministers after an opinion hasbeen given by the Consultative Assembly.&quot; Article 5The Council of Europe may co-ordinate the work of the SpecialisedAuthorities brought into relationship with the Council of Europe in accordancewith the terms of the present chapter, by holding joint discussions and by sub-mitting recommendations to them, as well as by forwarding recommendations to Member Governments.[&quot; Article 6The provisions of the present Chapter shall apply only to the EuropeanSpecialised Authorities whose aim and scope are within those of the Councilof Europe as defined in Article 1.&quot;]
CHAPTER III.-QUESTIONS ON WHICH IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TOREACH UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT30. Consequence of the Council of Europe with regard to Questions relating to national Defence Article I. paragraph (d) of the Statute. (Recommenda-tion 54, paragraph 4 (a))Several delegations declared that they were authorised to accept the Recom-mendation of the Assembly for the deletion of paragraph (d) of Article 1. certain other delegations, however, informed the Committee that their Governments hadfundamental objections to any extension of the competence of the Council ofEurope in the field of national defence.31. Competence of the Council of Europe in the political field Article 1, para-graph (b) of the Statute.   (Recommendation 54, paragraph 4 (a))The majority of the Committee agreed in principle to insert in paragraph (b)of Article 1 after the words &quot; action in &quot; the word &quot; political.&quot;Certain delegations considered that the insertion of the word &quot;political&quot; inparagraph (b) of Article 1 would have the advantage of allowing the Council ofEurope to deal with certain political aspects of defence questions, paragraph (d) initself setting the limits to what was permissible.Certain delegations, however, made their acceptance conditional on an under-standing that the word &quot; political &quot; could not be interpreted as including questions relating to national defence and that a reservation to this effect should be introduced in Article 1 (b) in the form of an explicit reference to Article 1 (d).Other delegations opposed the insertion of the word &quot; political &quot; in Article 1 (b)as, notwithstanding this reservation, it might give rise to ambiguous interpretationsand thus permit the Council of Europe to discuss the political aspects of defence questions.32. Consultative Functions of the Assembly Article 22 of the Statute. (proposal by M. La Malfa and others)The Committee unanimously approved the principles underlying the proposal of M. La Malfa. As regards the formulation of these principles, certain delegationscould not agree that Members should be under an obligation to transmit to theAssembly any project or proposal of European scope on which they may engage.The majority were, however, in favour of adding to Article 22 two new para-graphs to the following effect:  &quot; The text of all treaties concluded between two or more Member states on subjects within the competence of the Council of Europe, under the termsof Article 1 of the Statute, shall be communicated to the Council of Europefor information [before ratification].&quot; By agreement among the signatory States, the opinion of the Council ofEurope may be requested within a specified period of time. In this case theCommittee of Ministers shall transmit the text of the treaty to the consultative assembly.&quot;33. Appearance in the Assembly of Ministers not Members of the Committee ofMinisters Article 21 of the Statute. (Proposal made by the President ofthe Consultative Assembly in his letter of 4th September, 1950)This proposal was accepted by a majority. The minority considered that since the Committee of Ministers was the organ of the Council of Europe which represented Member Governments, it was the function of the Foreign Ministers toact and speak on behalf of their Governments both in the Committee of Ministers,and, if necessary, in the Assembly. The minority could not, therefore, accept theview that Ministers other than members of the Committee of Ministers should appear before the Assembly.34. Transmission of Recommendations of the Assembly to National Parliaments(Recommendation 14)The majority of the Committee agreed to propose the adoption of Recom-mendation 14 relating to the transmission to national parliaments of recommenda-tions of the Assembly, provided that the words &quot; by a two-thirds majority &quot; shouldbe substituted for the words &quot; by a majority of its members.&quot;
The minority were opposed to this recommendation for the following reasons: -(a) It was an attempt in their view to evade the existing provisions of theStatute which should only be altered by formal amendments; and (b)) It was an infringement of the prerogative of Member Governments and national parliaments.The minority were prepared to agree that the Committee of Ministers should adopt a resolution to the following effect:-&quot; The Committee of Ministers will in appropriate cases and where theAssembly has so requested invite Member Governments to submit to their national parliaments for examination in public debate matters forming thesubject of Recommendations under Article 15 (b) of the Statute.&quot;35. Adoption of Resolutions by the Committee of Ministers (Recommendation 3)The majority of the Committee agreed to propose the adoption of Recom-mendation 3 relating to the adoption of resolutions by the Committee of ministers by a vote &quot;in principle,&quot; subject to the deletion of the last two lines and to thesubstitution of the word &quot; recommendation &quot; for the word &quot; agreement&quot; if theCommittee of Ministers did not accept the Committee&apos;s recommendation in para-graph 12 of Chapter 1 of this Report.The minority opposed this Recommendation on the ground that it was contrary to the intention of the Statute and that modifications to the Statue shouldbe made only by formal amendment.36. Mitigation of the Unanimity Rule for the Adoption by the Committee ofMinisters of &quot; Recommendations &quot; to the Governments Article 20 of theStatute. (Recommendation 54, paragraph 4 (b))The majority of the Committee was not able to support the Amendment pro-posed on this matter by the Assembly.  A minority was in favour of the Recom-mendation.37. Secrecy of the Debates of the Committee of Ministers Article 21 of theStatute. (Recommendation 54, paragraph 4 (c))The majority of the Committee was unable to recommend that the amendmentof the present text of Article 21 should be accepted, on the grounds that the secrecy of the deliberations of the Committee of Ministers was one of the means for pre-serving solidarity between the Ministers, which was necessary for the properfunctioning of the Council. The minority did not consider this reason to be decisive and declared themselves in favour of the Recommendation of theAssembly.Paris, 21th February, 1951.APPENDIX AResolution adopted by the Committee of Ministers at its Sixth Session in rome on 3rd and 4th November, 1950The Committee of Ministers at its Sixth Session in Rome on 3rd and 4thNovember, 1950, adopted the following Resolution:  &quot; The Committee of Ministers examined the Recommendations of theAssembly relating to modifications of the Statute and the general functioning of the Council of Europe.&quot; The Committee recognised that the above Recommendations should bemore carefully studied. To this end it invited the Governments to appointsenior officials with the necessary qualifications to meet together to examinethe whole question. In the meantime, there was general agreement with the, principles contained in the Assembly&apos;s Recommendations Nos. 1 and 4(AS/2/121 and 123).&quot; The Committee of Experts should complete its task before 1st March,1951. It will report to the Committee of Ministers who will then consult thecompetent authorities of the Assembly as to the best method to adopt.&quot;
