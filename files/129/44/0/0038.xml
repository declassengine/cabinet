IrHlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET 1 4 iCP.(51) 38 - COPY NO.6TH FEBRUARY, 1951CABINETWAR criminals memorandum by the Minister of StateGerman war criminals at the end of the war were dealt with in three ways.     The &apos;major&quot; war criminals, a. e. those whose crimes hadno particular geographical location, were tried by the InternationalMilitary Tribunal at Nuremberg, a quadripartite Court.     Lesser war criminals were tried partly by Courts established on a zonal basis inGermany (the fact that many of the purely United States Zone trials were held at Nuremberg sometimes causes confusion), and partly by Courtsestablished in Allied countries, the accused having been either originallyarrested in those countries or extradited from Germany.     This paperdeals only with those war criminals for whose continued detention HisMajesty&apos;s Government bears responsibility, i. e. those sentenced by theInternational Military Tribunal and now confined in Berlin, and thosesentenced by British Military Courts and now confined in the british zone of Germany.2. The prisoners sentenced to imprisonment by the InternationalMilitary Tribunal are held at Spandau prison in Berlin. Any review oftheir sentences should be considered under Article 29 of the Charter ofthe International Military Tribunal, the first sentence of which reads:&quot;In case of guilt, sentences shall be carried out in accordance withthe orders of the Control Council for Germany, which may at anytime reduce or otherwise alter the sentences, but may not increasethe severity thereof.&quot;Since the Control Council is in abeyance, this provision can no longer begiven effect .     But the Governments of the United Kingdom, United States,France and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the original signatories of the London Agreement of 8th August, 1945, to which the Charter of theTribunal is annexed, could no doubt claim the right jointly to review andmodify the sentences.3. The sentences of the prisoners held at Spandau are not at present under review and His Majesty&apos;s Government do not intend to initiate a review.     Such quadripartite discussions as there have been regardingthese prisoners have been concerned with their treatment while in prison(accommodation, exercise, health, etc. ).     It is possible that in the caseof an individual prisoner at Spandau, reasons of health would justify theconsideration of a proposal for the release on compassionate grounds ordetention elsewhere of one or more of the prisoners.     Medical reports are received from time to time and considered in this connection.
4. As regards prisoners held in the United Kingdom Zone, it wasdecided by His Majesty&apos;s Government in 1949 that a general review of sentences should be undertaken and the No.  1 War Crimes Review board was set up under a War Office Directive dated 27th August, 1949.     Theobject of the review was to ensure so far as possible uniformity of punishment among prisoners sentenced by British Military Courts.     Asa result of the Board&apos;s recommendations 58 sentences were reduced outof a total of 372 considered.5. On 20th December, 1949, powers of clemency for war criminals(a former responsibility of the Secretary of State for War which had beentransferred to the Foreign Office), were delegated by the Foreign Secretaryto General Robertson, as High Commissioner.     These powers weredelegated again by the Foreign Secretary to the present High Commissioneron 29th June, 1950.     Since December, 1949, 27 prisoners have benefitedby clemency as the result of consideration of individual cases under theabove powers.     There remain 230 cases, the balance having been releasedon expiry of sentences, as reduced by the usual remissions for good conduct.     The High Commissioner decided last autumn that a further review of sentences should be undertaken this year and this review is nowin progress.6. In the United States Zone responsibility for war criminals is divided between the United States High Commissioner, Mr. McCloy,competent for war criminals sentenced by the United States Nurembergtribunals, and the United States Commander-in-Chief European Command,General Handy, competent for war criminals sentenced by United states military Courts.    A Clemency Board established by Mr. McCloy has completed a review of Nuremberg cases and its recommendations are thebasis of decisions recently announced by Mr. McCloy involving manyreductions of sentence.     A similar review of sentences is still takingplace for those war criminals under the competence of General Handy,who is advised by a War Crimes Modification Board;   so far as he has announced his decisions only in respect of those prisoners under sentence of death.     (Public attention has centred particularly on the 28 prisonersat Dandsberg Prison until recently under sentence of death.     In thesecases the execution of the death sentence had been deferred for a con-siderable time as a result of appeals brought before Courts in the UnitedStates and now rejected.     Of these 28 death sentences, 21 have now beencommuted and the remaining 7 have been confirmed. )7. In the French Zone no general review has been undertakenalthough petitions for clemency are treated individually,8. The following is the position regarding certain special cases:Manstein    -     Manstein was condemned some eighteen months ago andis within the category of prisoners judged by british military Courts in the British Zone;   his sentence, whichwas one of eighteen years&apos; imprisonment, reduced onconfirmation to twelve years, will therefore be reviewedunder the general arrangement for the collective reviewof the sentence of all prisoners in this category.     (Thefact that a sentence is being reviewed by no meansautomatically implies that it will be altered. )    No special treatment will be accorded to Manstein, e. g. he will notbe represented by Counsel before the reviewing authority,since this is not the practice.
Krupp     - Under a war-time law, the validity of which may be challenged, Alfried Krupp-is the owner of the assetsbelonging to the former firm of Friedrich Krupp.     Hewas condemned as a war criminal by a United StatesTribunal a&apos;t Nuremberg, and his prison sentence has nowbeen remitted by Mr.  McCloy.     The original sentenceincluded the deprivation of his property, and Mr. McCloyhas now revoked this on the grounds first, that thisdeprivation was unique among all the Nuremberg sentences,and secondly that it is &apos;not in accordance with legal practice in the United States.   A statement issued in Germany byMr. McCloy said &quot;I can find no personal guilt in DefendentKrupp, based upon the charge in this case, sufficient to distinguish him from all others sentenced by the NurembergCourts&quot;.     As regards Krupp&apos;s property, Mr. McCloy said in his statement &quot;I am making no judgments as to theultimate title to the former Krupp property.     Theproperty.....will be subject to Allied High CommissionLaw No,  27 on the re-organisation of the German coal,iron and steel industries, and is not affected by thisdecision. &quot;    The primary purpose of Law 27 is the pre-vention of the return to pos-itions of ownership and controlof those who have been found, or may be found, to havefurthered the aggressive designs of the Nazi Party.     Theposition of Alfried Krupp in regard to his title to compensation for the Krupp properties seized under Law27 is being further examined in Germany, and I hope tohave further information for my colleagues at an earlydate.     Meanwhile it should be noted that the decision was- one which could only be taken by the United States HighCommissioner.     The United Kingdom High Commissionerwas indeed consulted as to the legal consequences in theBritish Zone which might flow from a decision to revoke the sentence.     He was not consulted about the merits ofthe decision.9. The above is a factual account of the position as regards war criminals in Germany.     There is also to be borne in mind the strong feeling in Germany against war crimes trials and convictions.     Thereis also a general impression among the Germans that there have been serious discrepancies in the sentences awarded by various Courts for similar offences.10. While there is a great deal that is unreasonable in this german attitude, it is nevertheless widespread among respectable Germans ofall classes.     Fundamentally it is based not on any avowed wish toexculpate war criminals, but on two simple contentions:(a) that it is morally wrong for the victors to try and condemnthe vanquished;(b) that the defence of acting on superior instructions shouldhave been given far more weight in respect of service personnel.
11. In these circumstances, whilst we clearly must not allow our-selves to be, deflected from doing what is just and right, it is, neverthe-less, a fact that we have a strong interest in mitigating public resent-merit in Germany^      This interest arises from the development&apos;ofBritish policy towards Germany.    It is now our declared object, and thaiof the French and United States Governments, to bring the federal republic into full political and economic co-operation with the West, and discussions are already in progress with a view to enabling Germany tocontribute to Western defence.     When a factor of serious importanceemerges which hinders the implementation of this new policy towards germany, it is incumbent tin the High Commissioner and His&apos; Majesty&apos;sGovernment to take this factor into consideration and to give it duepolitical weight.     The German attitude to war crimes has been recognised as an important factor of this kind by both the United Kingdom and UnitedStates High Commissioners in Germany.     It is therefore desirable that nothing should be left undone which would help to place the question of war crimes in its true light in Germany and to ensure that no reasonable cause for complaint (e. g.  in regard to possible inequality of sentences forthe same offence) can remain.     It is with the above considerations in mind that the present review of sentences in the United Kingdom Zone is being undertaken.12. It was against this background that Sir I.  Kirkpatrick recently made a statement in Germany about war criminals while informallyanswering questions from correspondents at the British Press Club inBerlin.     No record was made of the High Commissioner^ exact words,but the following is the most accurate account available of what he said:An American correspondent asked Sir I.  Kirkpatrick whether he was aware of a strong body of opinion in Germany that the sentencesagainst the former Admirals Raeder and Doenitz should be revised.     TheHigh Commissioner first dealt with the general question of war criminals.He said that he thought everyone in the room would agree that there wasa need for peace in the world and that we should all strive for peace.If we were agreed in striving for peace, then we should agree that hatredand revenge were bad counsellors.     He said that he was at present engaged in a review of the sentences o&apos;f the criminals confined at Werl,who were under his jurisdiction.     There were some 240 of these prisoners and he hoped to have completed his review of their caseswithin the first few months of this year.     He knew that Mr. McCloy was engaged in a similar review of the sentences of the prisoners confinedat Landsberg.     He could not say when Mr. McCloy&apos;s review would be finished;   the task was a very difficult and lengthy one since it involvedpersonal scrutiny of each case.     The questioner then pressed his question about Raeder and Doenitz.     The High Commissioner repliedthat he and his colleagues had received an appeal from the Senate ofKiel University on behalf of Raeder who was an honorary Doctor of theUniversity.     He had not received a specific appeal for Doenitz.     But hepersonally would be prepared to review also the sentences against the prisoners confined in Spandau, in a manner similar to the review nowbeing made in the Western Zones,     This was a matter which requiredfour Power decision and he proposed to discuss with his colleagues the specific appeal which they had received for Raeder.     The HighCommissioner was then asked whether he would be prepared to review the case of Hess whom he knew so well.     He replied that there was noone whose case he personally would not be prepared to review.
13. It will be seen from the above record that Sir I. Kirkpatrick&apos;remarks were not intended to carry all the implications which the press reports at the time seemed to suggest.     The statement was mainly con-cerned with prisoners under his direct control.     The question of theSpandau prisoners arose only out of the particular case of the petitionin favour of Admiral Raeder, and Sir I. Kirkpatrick made it clear thaton this case he was only expressing a personal opinion.     Equally itis clear that the remark about &quot;hatred and revenge&quot;, though no doubtopen to misconstruction, was certainly not intended to reflect on theNuremberg or other Allied Tribunals.14. I have drawn the attention of Sir I.  Kirkpatrick to the danger of expressing, even on a personal basis, controversial opinions on matterson which no authoriative guidance has been obtained from His Majesty&apos;sGovernment,     I have also reminded him that British and Allied opinion is at present highly sensitive on all questions relating to the possiblerevival in Germany of militarism and&apos;Nazism and that this public feelingmust be taken into account no less than German opinion in framingofficial policy.15. In conclusion I trust that my colleagues will agree that our HighCommissioner in Germany should have reasonable freedom to makespeeches and to give Press Conferences in Germany.     His position andthat of his United States and French colleagues is very different from thatof an ambassador in a normal country - he forms in fact a considerable part of the actual Government of Germany and it is in that capacity thatit is right and proper that he should from time to time explain HisMajesty&apos;s Governments policy in respect of Germany, for the executionof which he is responsible.*K.G.Y.Foreign Office, S.W.1,6TH FEBRUARY, 1951.
