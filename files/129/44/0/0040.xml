THIS DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY   OF HIS   BRITANNIC MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1951SECRETCP. (51) 408th February, 1951CABINETPERSIAMemorandum by the Minister of state in his memorandum on the present situation in Persia, the Foreign secretary undertook to inform his colleagues of the conclusions reached in the discussionsthen in progress between the interested Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company on measures to improve the situation (CP.(51) 28, paragraph 11).2.   These measures fall, broadly, into three classes:-(a) Immediate: to relieve the Persian Governments acute shortage of funds;(b) Short-term:   to establish Persia&apos;s political and economic stability underRazmara, the present Prime Minister;(c) Long-term:  to promote the firm conclusion of an oil agreement which,in regularising the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company&apos;s position, will providePersia with the full financial returns offered by the Company.?, 3. As regards (a), the Company informed the Persian Prime Minister on31st January that they were prepared to deposit forthwith in the Bank Melli(Persian National Bank), as backing for an increased note issue (the most immediateof Persia&apos;s needs), a sum of  10 million. This offer has been accepted.4.   As regards (b) (i) The Company told us in strict confidence, which we have undertaken to respect, that they were ready to make further advances on accountof royalties over and above present royalty rates, either as a lump sumor (preferably) in the form of monthly payments, if this were necessaryto tide the Persian Government over the next few months and thus giveRazmara time to prepare his next move. The Company have nowoffered Razmara, and he has accepted, advances of royalties amountingto  25 million,  5 million to be paid at once and  2 million monthlythroughout the next 10 months. This transaction is for the present being kept confidential.(ii) His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador has been instructed to represent to Razmara(and to the Shah if he thinks this will be useful) the desire of HisMajesty&apos;s Government to assist Persia and their consequent anxietythat her internal position be stabilised as a bulwark against the spread of Communism, that the Seven-Year Plan of economic development bevigorously implemented and that the position of the Anglo-Iranian oil company, the chief source of Persia&apos;s badly needed funds, be regu-larised. In speaking in that sense, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador will bring to Razmara&apos;s attention various developments, both general and affectingBritish interests in particular, about which His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave recently been concerned. He will also urge the necessity of coming to an agreement with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and then takingresolute action to secure its ratification by the Majlis (Parliament).Finally, he will express the hope that Razmara will take the opportunityto speak as frankly in reply and to explain fully what steps he has inmind to take to remedy matters.40097Copy No.     J
5. As regards (c), the long-term measures, the Company are now ready todiscuss with Razmara any proposals for an oil agreement which he may wish toput forward. There are no firm indications from Tehran of the present temperof those Majlis Deputies who have hitherto pressed for nationalisation of the oil industry in Persia and who obstructed ratification of the Supplemental Oil Agree-ment. It is more than likely, however, that, with the recent conclusion betweenthe Saudi Arabian Government and the Arabian-American Oil Company (Aramco)of an oil agreement on what is known as the &quot; 50:50 profit sharing &quot; basis, only an entirely new approach offers real hope of the conclusion of satisfactory arrange-ments between the Persian Government and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. TheCompany therefore do not exclude discussion of an agreement on such a basis. Itis by no means certain that under such an agreement Persia&apos;s financial benefits would be any greater than those she would have obtained under the rejectedSupplemental Agreement; but Persian emotions in this matter have to be takeninto account.6. It is hoped that these measures will prove adequate. Representatives ofthe Foreign Office and the Treasury, however, will shortly visit Tehran to discuss matters further on the spot; and an official of the State Department is expected in London in the second week of February with a view to discussing the positionin Persia as a preliminary to any further discussions with the Americans that maybe thought necessary on return of our representatives from Tehran.K.
