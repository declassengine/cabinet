C\r-c,   2TSll/57 C^p^)THIS  DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY   OF HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1951SECRET Copy No.   3CP. (51) 2323rd January, 1951CABINETSUPPLY OF NATIONAL SERVICE MEN TO MEET THE NEEDS OFTHE forces memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and theSecretary of State for scotland we most strongly oppose the suggestion in the Annex to CP. (51) 22 that wecan afford at this time to stop the special arrangements for deferment of call-upof young agricultural workers. In our view this is quite incompatible with thefacts of the agricultural labour situation and with the considerations that we have still half our Agricultural Expansion Programme to complete; that this second half of the programme will be the hardest in any case; and that the Governmenthave promised full support to the farming community in their efforts to complete the programme.2. We do not seek to dispute the proposition that for the moment there isa rough balance in agriculture between labour supply and current requirements.But we have still a long way to go to attain our production targets. These alreadyassume an increase in the productivity of the labour in agriculture, which is takingplace all the time, and it may be that we shall be able to achieve our aims withoutany substantial further increase in the agricultural labour force. But that is very uncertain at present. What is certain, however, is that we shall lose some thousands of workers from agriculture in the next few months owing to the release ofEuropean Volunteer Workers from control, through wastage amongst theex-Women&apos;s Land Army members who have remained on the land, and throughthe attractions of defence industry. Later on there will no doubt be losses amongjthe exTprisoners of war who are at present restricted to agricultural employment.The likelihood of losses of this kind is recognised in paragraph 8 of the Annex toC.P. (51) 22. It is quite clear that we cannot possibly afford to lose on top of that between 15 and 20,000 young men in 1951 and another 15-20,000 in 1952, for twoyears&apos; national service, which means a standing withdrawal of something like35,000, which is equivalent to 5 per cent, of the number of regular workers in theindustry.3. There is already a tendency for the labour in the industry to decline. Thenumber of regular workers in ,Great Britain, including members of the Women&apos;s land Army, as recorded in the agricultural returns, went down by 15,000 betweenJune 1949 and June 1950. $ feqks as if it wili certainly be less still in June 1951,kuite &quot;apart &apos;frq a &apos;vs^y&apos;-steips &quot;lafcen&apos; in. &apos;^B^ectipa with call-up. Indeed, unless wecan get replacernjents for the losses $at are occurring arjtd that wall continue topccuf for the reasons mentioned in ,the preceding paragraph, we are likely, in anycase, to have to f^ce ;a ^or^age of agricultural labour for our expansion programme in the next two years. &quot;We&quot;understanH  hat the statistics prepared by the Ministryof Labour from the insurance cards indicate a much heavier decline in the agricul-tural labour force over the past two years, but whatever the precise extent of thedecline there is no doubt that the agricultural labour force is decreasingsubstantially.[39936]  40011
4. These are the practical difficulties of the present labour situation. Thereis also the psychological aspect. Any decision for a drastic alteration in the present arrangements for deferment of call-up of agricultural workers would come on top of a series of events which are all the time forcing the farmer to do still more tomake his own labour arrangements the disbandment of the Women&apos;s Land Army,the drastic reduction (and in many counties the elimination) of the county agricultural Executive Committee Labour Pools, and a reduction in the help fromschoolchildren. How could the farming industry be expected to regard this asanything other than a clear indication that the Government is no longer seriouslyconcerned about expanding food production? That is certainly how it would beregarded and the consequent effects on food production from this cause alone wouldbe bound to be serious. That is something that we can afford least of all at thepresent time.5. The Minister of Labour suggests that the industry does not make seriousefforts to meet its own labour problems. Farmers are naturally reluctant, as are other employers, to take untrained and unsuitable labour, and where units are small the introduction of inexperienced labour presents real difficulties. Never -theless, as is shown in paragraph 9 of the Annex to CP. (51) 22, they have increased their recruitment steadily since 1945 and have succeeded in making good the lossof the very large prisoner force available until 1947. We, for our part, have certainly kept up continual pressure on the farmers by reducing, and makingdearer, the special supplies of labour provided under Government auspices. Wecannot but express surprise that the Minister of Labour, while proposing ameasure which would take no less than 35,000 young men out of agriculture, makes no reference to the problem of getting replacements. There is, however, no reasonto believe that any appreciable amount of replacement labour will be forthcoming.Very little labour of any kind is available through the Employment Exchanges.The Minister of Labour in particular passes lightly over the difficulties of the smallfarm. These will be serious indeed, and any drastic alteration of the defermentarrangements would lead to a flood of appeals on the ground that the work ofthe farm cannot be carried on without the man in question, and that the &quot; alterna-tive arrangements &quot; referred to by the Minister of Labour cannot in fact be made.6. We must take exception to the Minister of Labour&apos;s suggestion in para-graph 12 of his memorandum that agriculture has become a funk-hole. We donot believe that this is true save for a very small and quite insignificant minority.Correspondence which may be prompted by spite or envy is not evidence to whichwe should attach much weight.7. Lastly, we must draw attention to the effect of the proposal in the eventof our being committed in a major war. It would mean that considerable numbersof agricultural workers who had passed through their national service would beavailable for recall. It may well be, however, that in the event of a war we should in any case be faced with a man-power deficit in agriculture and it is hardly possibleto contemplate aggravating this by the recall from farms of substantial numbersof former National Servicemen. Our colleagues may remember the difficulties caused early in the last war by the mobilisation of agricultural workers who were members of the Territorial Army.8. We have, of course, considered carefully the National Service problems to which the Minister of Labour draws attention, but it does not seem to us thatthe difficulties there are anything like as serious as those that would be caused bythe suggested remedy of discontinuing the deferment of call-up for young agricul-tural workers. The gap between National Service supplies and requirements is comparatively small, especially if regulars are retained. In any case the Ministerof Labour&apos;s proposals covering the lowering of medical standards and the can-cancellation of the agricultural deferment appear calculated to provide numbers well beyond the size of the gap which he has demonstrated. Indeed, so far as agriculture is concerned, his proposition appears to be that whatever the precise needs of thesituation the agricultural deferment should be completely cancelled on merits. Forthe reasons given, we are quite unable to agree.T. W.H. McN.23rd January, 1951.
