this document is  the  property   of his  britannic  majesty&apos;s   governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1951SECRETCP. (51) 7\0th January, 1951CABINETECONOMY IN THE USE OF COAL: FURTHER measures memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and PowerSummertimeI proposed to the Cabinet on 14th December that Summertime in 1951 shouldbe extended by eight weeks, so as to run from 18th March, to 28th October. TheCabinet decided (CM. (50) 86th Conclusions, Minute 6) to defer consideration of thisproposal until they had before them comprehensive proposals for fuel economy.A Summary of the measures being taken to promote fuel economy is attached(Appendix A). I now ask that my colleagues, in the light of these measures, to reconsider my previous recommendation for the extension of Summertime by eight weeks, and also to consider the following two proposals.2. Broadcasting after 11 p.m.I attach an extract (Appendix B) of last Wednesday^ meeting of the OfficialCoal Committee. It seems to me that though the saving in fuel will be small, to havebroadcasting cease at 11 p.m. will undoubtedly emphasise to the public the seriousness of the situation in the same way as will the banning of shop andadvertisement lighting.3. Mid-week Sport&quot;I attach an extract (Appendix C) of the minutes of a meeting of the OfficialCoal Committee Item 3 (O.C.C. (50) 9th Meeting). The other restrictive measures referred to have been taken, and I would ask my colleagues to consider now therecommendations about mid-week football because of its effects on coal production.Mid-week racing can be considered later; the Grand National is on a Saturday,and the St. Leger is not until September. I recommend, however, that the FootballAssociation be approached now id) to arrange for replays of cup-ties on Saturdays (instead of mid-week), and(b) if the FA. could not agree to this, to reduce the number of replays by arranging for extra time to be played in cup-ties in which scores are levelafter 90 minutes&apos; play.My colleagues will have seen the report that Sir Patrick Dollan is closing down hisFuel Efficiency Committee in Scotland until the Government impose a ban on mid-week sporting events. I have also to answer several questions on this matter when parliament assembles.P. J. N-B.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1,10th January, 1951.Copy No. g 239921
APPENDIX AMeasures being taken to promote Fuel Economy, The drive for economy in the use of fuel will be based chiefly on exhortationand publicity. The following are some of the more important measures beingtaken:  (1) There will be a Press Advertising Campaign beginning in the week ending13th January.(2) The daily and weekly press are being invited to co-operate.(3) There will be a poster advertising campaign if posters can. be printed anddisplayed in*time.(4) The Cinematograph Exhibitors&apos; Association are producing and showinga short film on Fuel Economy.(5) The Women&apos;s Organisations are co-operating, concentrating their attentionparticularly on the domestic consumer.(6) All national and local organisations such as Chambers of Trade, chambers of Commerce, &amp;c. who may have any contacts with consumers or anyparticular class of consumer, are being invited to co-operate.(7) All establishments controlled by Government Departments or LocalAuthorities are being asked to set an example by exercising the mostrigid economy.(8) As from 8th January display lighting, including both advertising and shopwindow lighting, are prohibited.APPENDIX BB.B.C. programmes Committee discussed the suggestion that the B.B.C. should be asked to stop broadcasting at 11-0 p.m. It was pointed out that as well, as saving fueldirectly, this would have a valuable psychological effect in emphasising the serious-ness of the fuel situation to the public generally.The Committee (4) Invited the Ministry of Fuel and Power to take note of their view that theB.B.C. should be asked to stop broadcasting at 11-0 p.m.APPENDIX CMid-week Sport . -The Committee had before them the report of the Working Party on Mid-weekSport (O.C.C. (50) 19).... The Working Party had found difficulty in assessing the effect on coal pro-duction of a ban on mid-week sport in mining areas. There was some reason tobelieve that much coal would be lost if the St. Leger were held on a Wednesdayas at present planned, but on the other hand the attitude of the miners if their sportwas interfered with had to be taken into account. The effect of prohibiting mid-week football matches was more speculative. It would be much easier to prohibitmid-week football as part of a general programme of restrictive measures designedto increase production and limit consumption of coal, than to deal with it in isolation.
The following points were made in discussion:  (a) Whereas the St. Leger was not run until September, cup-tie replays were an immediate problem. The Football Association had experienced greatdifficulty in arranging for all cup-ties to be played on Saturdays when there was last a ban on mid-week matches.(b) The Football Association might be asked to arrange for an extra half-hour tobe played in any cup-tie where there was no result at the end of thearranged period: at present this was done only for replayed matches.(c) Cup-ties which were drawn twice were replayed in a neutral town. It mightbe suggested that such replays should not take place in mining areas.The Committee (1) Agreed that, in view of the difficulties in arranging replays of cup-ties onSaturdays, means of doing so should be discussed With the FootballAssociation, and the Jockey Club should be asked to arrange for the st. Leger and other races in mining areas to be run on Saturdays in1951.(2) Agreed that football matches arranged as part of the Festival of britain should not be rearranged.(3) Agreed to recommend that limitations on mid-week sport should be imposedonly if other restrictive measures were taken.
