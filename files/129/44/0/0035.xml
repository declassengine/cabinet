January, 1951CABINETINTER-RELATION BETWEEN FARM PRICES, RETAIL FOOD prices and FOOD SUBSIDIESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at their meeting on 15th May, 1950 (CM. (50) 31st Conclusions, Minute 2),the Cabinet invited me, in consultation with the Agricultural Ministers and theMinister of Food, to submit for their information a general memorandum on theinter-relation between farm prices, retail food prices and food subsidies. It seemedto me that the appropriate time to circulate this paper was shortly before the february Price Review when it would serve as background to any policy discussions which might be necessary.This memorandum is not concerned with imports of food, and no account istaken of the effect of changes in the price or quantity of imported supplies, although in effect the consequences on retail prices and subsidies from such changes arevery much the same as in the case of changes in the price or quantity of home-produced supplies. To simplify a complicated problem, changes in the cost of distribution of subsidised foods are ignored; this is a perfectly reasonable assump-tion in view of the control exercised by the Ministry of Food over distributionmargins.2. The basic fact is that the Ministry of Food&apos;s &quot; subsidies &quot; take the formnot of outright gifts of fixed sums but trading losses, i.e., the difference between whatthe Ministry receives and what it pays out for the produce and services in whichit deals. The Ministry must either buy home produce or imported produce and assuming imports remaining constant in price and quantity, then any increase inthe prices paid to farmers, for an unchanged output, must involve an increase inMinistry expenditure. This can only be offset by an increase either in Ministryreceipts (i.e., in retail prices) or in Ministry losses (i.e., in food subsidies). Thetotal Ministry loss or subsidy is fixed in the Budget and if this loss is already being incurred, the extra cost to the Ministry of higher prices to farmers can only be recovered by increased retail prices; the subsidy arrangements do, however, permitprice increases to be distributed among the subsidised commodities according tochoice. Equally, an increase in the supply from home farmers of a subsidisedcommodity, even if the price paid to them remains the same, must be followed byan increase either in retail food prices or in the total subsidy. This follows fromthe fact that on every unit of a subsidised commodity the Ministry makes a loss,so that if they sell more of it the total loss is greater.3. The present practice is to fix the global total of the Ministry of Food&apos;ssubsidies (or trading losses) before the year&apos;s trading begins. This means that anynet increases in the quantity and price of some commodities must involve either:(a) an increase in selling prices which, with fixed margins, means an increasein retail prices; or(b) a reduction in buying prices of other commodities; oric) a reduction in the quantity bought of other commodities, which might involve reduced rations.Since the prices of home products are fixed at the February Price Review and theprices of 58 per cent, of imports of subsidised foods are fixed under long-term contracts, there is little room for manoeuvre.40068 B
4. The estimated cost of food subsidies in the current financial year is 409 - 5 million. This is divided into  253 - 3 million on home-produced food and 156-2 million on imports.   Appendix I shows the subsidies in detail on:  (a) Foods produced partly in the United Kingdom and partly overseas.ib) Foods entirely home-produced.  &quot;(c) Welfare foods.id) Foods entirely imported.It also shows the relation between subsidies and the cost-of-living index (all items).The figures used in this paper are those of the original estimate of the Ministryof Food; in the nature of things they are subject to constant changes and it would only confuse the issue to attempt to revise them.5. The subsidy on home produce is variously alleged from time to time tobe wholly advantageous to the producer or (apart from the direct subsidies to farmers included^1)) wholly advantageous to the consumer. Neither view is correct. The former would imply that if there were no food subsidies and nofood rationing farmers could not sell their output except at a level corresponding to the current level of retail prices. The latter disregards the fact that without the subsidies a rise in prices would lead to less being bought so that farmers&quot;&apos; incomeswould decline; it glosses over the extent to which the demand for food is maintained by subsidies amounting to 15s. per household per week, about 85. 9d. of which isfor home produce.6. In the most general sense therefore all these subsidies benefit both theUnited Kingdom consumer and the home producer. While they enable the con-sumer to buy food at a lower price, directly in the case of most of the food subsidies,indirectly through increasing output at artificially low costs in the case of theagricultural subsidies, the effect of the lower price is to enlarge the market to thebenefit of all producers.7. Any subdivision of the subsidies between consumer and producer is boundto be highly conjectural. But one could say that at least that part of the subsidywhich corresponds to the difference between farm prices at home and the pricesof imports, after making some allowance for the fact that consumers are willingto pay higher prices for home-grown produce,(2) is a producer subsidy.8. Within these limitations Appendix II gives some indication of the extentto which the food subsidies may be regarded as producer subsidies. It is estimatedthat, of the total subsidy for home-produced meat, eggs and bacon amounting toabout  85 million, the producer subsidy element is somewhere between  41 million and  51 million, or roughly 50 per cent. In the case of foods such as liquid milk and potatoes which are virtually all home-produced and where it is not, therefore,possible to talk of consumer preference, the producer element in the subsidy is assumed quite arbitrarily to represent the same proportion of the total subsidy(namely one-half) as in the case of meat, eggs and bacon. The broad result of thisrough-and-ready calculation is that, of the subsidy on home-produced food of 253 million (out of the total subsidy of  410 million), about  90 million to 100 million may be regarded as a producer subsidy, to which should be added the direct agricultural subsidies borne on Agricultural Votes (lime subsidy, hill sheep and cattle subsidies, &amp;c), giving a total of  120 million to  130 million. In so faras we may at present be paying producer subsidies of this order, it can be regardedas the price we pay, for strategic and currency reasons, for the maintenance of a healthy home agriculture.9. It cannot be emphasised too much that these figures are very speculative,and subject to wide margins of error. The calculation also ignores the possibility that the measures being taken to stimulate home agricultural production might have their influence on the level of prices paid for imported food. If there had been no agricultural expansion programme we should, in order to maintain rations atanything like the present level, have had to import substantially larger quantities(&apos;) Part of the direct subsidies to farmers are included in the food subsidies, but the greaterpart (about  30 million for lime, hill sheep and cattle, &amp;c.) are excluded.(2) Food is purchased overseas at prices which differ one from the other for reasons otherthan consumer preference, and it might be a more accurate measure of United Kingdom producersubsidy to compare home prices with those of the dearest imported supplies after taking account of consumer preferences. Any revision of the figures through such a change would probably not greatly affect the comparisons.
of food, partly from the most expensive and difficult markets. This pressure on overseas markets would in some cases have meant a rise in the import price.10.   The following points are also worth special mention:  (a) In the past two years producers have borne a substantial part of the rising prices of the &quot; raw materials &quot; of agriculture, such as feeding-stuffs. Ifthere are no further increases of this kind the continued increase inefficiency should result in a reduction in prices for home producegenerally.(b) The farmers&apos; net income, i.e., profits, at present includes a sum (whichstarted at  40 million in 1947-48) intended to help farmers to finance the capital expenditure necessitated by the Agricultural expansion programme, but it is hoped that this can be withdrawn within the nextfew years, involving some reduction in farm prices.(c) If the Agricultural Expansion targets are in general achieved and the target for milk is exceeded, the subsidy bill in respect of home productionmight in the absence of price changes increase by at least  27.? million,of which roughly half would be extra producer subsidy. On the otherhand the abolition of the potato acreage payments and the fertilisersubsidy next year will involve a reduction of  10 million in producersubsidy.\d) In the case of some commodities, particularly milk and eggs, there is a danger of embarrassing surpluses, and if these could not be sold except at lower prices, either heavy additional losses would be incurred or theprices to the farmer will have to be reduced.H.

APPENDIX IIAn Indication of the Extent to which the Subsidies on Certain important commodities may be regarded as Producer Subsidies1. Carcase Meat includes fresh and frozen beef, mutton, lamb, veal, pork andoffals. All these commodities have retail prices varying with grades andtypes. The retail prices for imported supplies are lower than those for home-killedmeat and it may therefore be said that the consumer preference for home-killedmeat has to some extent been taken into account in arriving at the figure of 4f d in annex &quot; A.&quot;  The price differences are illustrated in Annex &quot; B.*&apos;This year the subsidy of  33^ million on carcase meat will be entirely for thebenefit of home produce (indeed, there will be a profit of  1-J million on imported meat.).0If the 1952-53 Agricultural Expansion Programme targets for meat are achievedthe subsidy will be about  5 million higher, assuming that there is no change inprices in the interval.Although present retail prices make some allowance for consumer preference,it is virtually certain that the price range could be widened but for the fact that the ration is based on expenditure, not on quantity as with other foods. It is notpossible in these cases to assess with any accuracy what the full consumerpreference might be. It is possible, however, that even if retail prices were adjusted to take full account of consumer preference the purchase cost of home-producedlivestock would still exceed by some  10 to  20 million the corresponding cost of imported meat.2. Shell Eggs. The subsidy on home-produced eggs this year will be just over 23 million, as compared with  3 million on imports.As in the case of meat the total cost of the subsidy will grow as suppliesincrease, unless there is a fall in first-hand prices greater than any reduction in retail prices necessary to ensure that supplies are sold. If the 1952-53 agriculturalexpansion target is achieved such extra subsidy would be of the order of  10 million.The present price differential between home-produced and foreign eggs isabout 6d. a dozen, but this is probably too low. A differential of Is. wouldprobably be nearer the mark, especially if home-produced eggs can reach the consumers more quickly, and on this basis the gap between losses on home andforeign eggs would be reduced to about  15 million.3. Bacon. The total subsidy on home supplies ( 27 million) is almost exactlydouble that on imports, although home supplies are expected to constitute only about 45 per cent, of the whole.If the expansion programme targets are reached and prices remain unchangedthe extra subsidy on home-produced bacon will be about \l\ million.Even before the war there was no marked consumer preference for home-produced bacon as compared with the bulk of imported. At present the generalquality of imports is superior, largely because of the inferior feeding-stuffs rationnow available and because since the war producers have been encouraged to turnout pigs at higher weights than the curers prefer. As this year&apos;s subsidy on home-produced bacon ( 27 million) is about double that on imported bacon, althoughsupplies are less than half the total, the producer subsidy is about  16 million.The total subsidy on home-produced meat, eggs and bacon is about  85 million,and on the above basis the producer subsidy element in this total is somethingbetween  41 million and  51 million, or roughly 50 per cent.4.   Milk. Excluding welfare milk this year&apos;s subsidy is put at  76 million.Milk production in 1949-50 was already higher than the target for 1952-53(2,015 million gallons as against 1,965 million). As things are at the moment allextra milk is likely to go to manufacture and on average each extra 20 million gallons is costing an extra  1 million in subsidy. (2) In the absence of favourable0) The profit of  1J million on imported meat is itself made up of a loss on Argentine meat,which is more than offset by a profit on meat imported from other sources.(2) This figure would have to be increased to the extent that the average realisation value of milk fell, as a result of the need to sell increased supplies to manufacturers of unsubsidised products,or in competition with cheaper imported milk products.
price changes, and on the basis of current production trends, the extra subsidy willbe  5 million.As we rely on home-produced supplies Of liquid milk, it is not possible to talk of consumer preference. There is little doubt, however, that farmers&apos; prices for milk, like their prices for other livestock products contain a substantial incentiveor production subsidy element, largely due to the high priority hitherto given tomilk on nutritional grounds. It is impossible to measure this except in a quitearbitrary manner. But if we assume that as in the case of meat, eggs and baconthe producer element is about half of the total subsidy, the appropriate figure is 38 million.5. Potatoes. The subsidy this year is estimated at  15^ million, and on thesame arbitrary assumption as in the case of milk this involves a producer subsidy of  7J million. Most of the  15^ million, however, is in respect of acreage pay-ments which will cease after this year. But there is an annual loss varying greatly in size due to the need for the Ministry of Food to take up surplus production.This is the cost of giving the farmers an assured market, and of insuring the con-sumer against shortage. The producer subsidy element in this is assumed for thepresent purpose to be on average about  1 million.6. Wheat, Butter, Cheese and Sugar. -There are at present no appreciabledifferences in the case of these commodities between the subsidies on home-pro-duced and imported. But in the case of home-produced butter and cheese thesubsidy calculations are artificial, and there is really a substantial extra subsidyabove that on imported butter and cheese, although this is reflected in the milksubsidy figure.7. Fertiliser Subsidy. This item which is included in the food subsidy calcu-lations will cost nearly  7 million this year, of which  34- million might be deemedto be producer subsidy. But the fertiliser subsidy will disappear next year.
