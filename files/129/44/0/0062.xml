THIS  DOCUMENT IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1951298SECRETCopy No. 31CP. (51) 6224th February, 1951CABINETOFFICES OF PROFITMemorandum by the Home secretary on 30th June, 1949, the Cabinet asked the Lord President^ Committee tosee what could be done to bring up-to-date the law relating to offices of profit underthe Crown (CM. (49) 43rd Conclusions, Minute 5). The Lord President&apos;? Committeearranged for a committee of officials under the chairmanship of the Solicitor-general to examine the subject in detail: and two reports from that committee* have beenconsidered by a sub-committee of the Lord President^ Committee over whichI presided.2. The draft of a House of Commons Disqualification Bill attached to thismemorandum is based on a Bill prepared for the Solicitor-General&apos;s committee butit has been modified to take account of the decisions reached by my committee. Theeffect of those decisions has not yet been fully worked out in the Bill; and there are other issues outstanding of which some involve little more than drafting but somewill need subsidiary policy decisions. These matters, however, have been left fora later revision of the Bill, as 1 am anxious to bring the broad essentials of the bill before the Cabinet without delay.3. In 1941, a Select Committee under the chairmanship of Sir Dennis Herbertmade a report on offices of profit. They did not find much amiss with the substance of the existing law, but recommended the introduction of legislation to repeal theexisting enactments and to restate the law with certain detailed amendments setout in the report. The Solicitor-GeneraPs committee decided that they could mostusefully start their work at the point where the Herbert Committee left it. their aim was to prepare a Bill designed primarily to clarify the existing law but with such changes of principle as seemed to make the law better adapted to present-daycircumstances and needs.4. The Bill may disappoint those who imagine that the subject could be dealtwith in a short general Bill which swept away all doubts and ambiguities. The Billclears up many uncertainties, but a number inevitably remain, and the Bill is some-what complicated because of the complexity of the subject matter.The Bill does not purport to be fully comprehensive. It does not deal withsuch grounds of disqualification as lunacy, bankruptcy or felony; but the law onthese matters is reasonably clear and is not closely related to the law on offices of profit. Disqualification on the ground of the holding of pensions from the Crownis not dealt with because it was outside the terms of reference of the Solicitor-GeneraFs Committee; that however is akin to office holding, and the law is enforce-able by common informers. The Bill does not deal with the problem of clergydisqualifications because the law on this subject could not be altered without priorstudy by a Select Committee or some similar body. We are, however, under pledge to initiate such a study at some stage.* L.P. (50) 95 and L.P. (H.C.D.) (51) 3.40186b
5. The basic principles underlying the Bill are those which originally gave rise to legislation on.this subject and which are still valid, namely:  (a) The incompatibility of certain offices (such as a judicial office or member-- ship of the Civil Service) with membership of the House of Commons;and(b) the need to preserve the independence of the House from the Crown andthe Government.6. In conformity with the first of these principles, clause 1 of the draft Billdisqualifies the holders of certain specified judicial, civil and military offices. Mostof these offices are paid, but payment is not made the ground for the disqualification-cation.In conformity with the second principle, clause 1(1)(/), coupled with clauses 2and 3, disqualifies the holders of paid offices or places under the Crown, subjectto exceptions in respect of a limited number of appointments and of certain miscel-laneous civil appointments which are only technically offices of profit.7. I have set out below the main issues arising on the detailed provisions ofthe Bill, to which the Cabinet will wish to address themselves.Renunciation of Remuneration8. The draft Bill, as originally submitted bv the Solicitor-GeneraFs com-mittee, would have enabled Members of the House of Commons to hold paidoffices under the Crown without incurring disqualification, provided that they agreed to forego remuneration. This was not based on any recommendation by theHerbert Committee and it was not unanimously supported by the Solicitor-GeneraFscommittee; but it was put forward as a convenient way of overcoming doubts whichmight arise in individual cases and as enabling Members of Parliament to hold a wide variety of appointments to which remuneration, usually small in amount, isattached and which, perhaps, could not disqualify unconditionally without riskinga charge of pedantry.9. My sub-committee took the view that a provision of this kind would be undesirable. There would be widespread suspicion of an arrangement under which an M.P., by renouncing remuneration, could accept an appointment which would attract a salary if held by an ordinary member of the public. Moreover, someCrown appointments confer financial influence which may enable the holder tosecure other well-paid appointments: from this angle it would be said that theclause favoured the wealthy M.P. who could afford to accept an appointment onthese terms. Some members might even regard as unfair a suggestion that the ratefor the job should not be paid.Emoluments in kind10. Another suggestion which my sub-committee did not see their way toadopt was a limitation of the scope of disqualification, in respect of &quot; paid offices,&quot;to offices which attract money payments. The sub-committee realised that to define&quot; remuneration &quot; in words so remote from money as to include quite intangiblebenefits, such as social prestige, might cause great uncertainty; they felt, however,that the possibilities of abuse, if the definition were to exclude emoluments in kind,would be so great as to make it most unlikely that the Solicitor-General&apos;s proposal would be acceptable to the House of Commons. If the scope of the Bill was limited to payments in cash, it would be possible to provide office holders withfood, motor cars or living accommodation without rendering them liable to dis-qualification. Emoluments in kind are always attractive, and never more so thanin times of high taxation. Clause 2 of the- Bill as now framed provides thatremuneration means &quot; any money payment and any other benefit capable of having a money value assigned to it with reasonable facility &quot;; these words represent a middle course, covering emoluments in kind but not making an office a &quot; paid&apos;office,&quot; if it carries no benefit to which: a money value can be assigned, merely onthe ground that it confers, either social prestige or financial influence.Office or Place11. The use in the Bill of the words &quot; office or place&quot; may be criticised.They are taken from the Succession to the Crown Act, 1707, and their meaning has given rise to difficulties. No one can explain in what respect an &quot; office &quot; differs from a &quot; place.&quot; The use of the word &quot; appointment&quot; would simplify the drafting,
put jts^eajning^ would be as doubtful. - It would; be embarrassing^^ajji^;^^ii&apos;^t^foltbclito admit in debate that.the meaning of thene^wb^is; Wa%eM^\t^:i\\sii-of the old phrase: - We therefore recommend theUf$0ia&amp;f&amp; the ^ime1 being&apos; of the&apos; termu&apos; office or place;&apos;&apos; It is possible, thoughn&amp;p$T0^pJw , ^^^b^t^JWpir^gj&apos;May be suggested at the Committee stage, k;&apos; Number of-MiM^tf^td^hs-MinmiOp^ammom^r maiy- gsyea: ; - ;ii,)(ii2i Clause. 4 -limits to sixty^fiye&apos;tfee number of Ministers,permitted to sit inthe House:of Commons at any one time., This exceeds by five the figure recom-mended bythe Herbert ^Committee, but this is necessary in the light Of &quot;Miiiisterialchahgessince 1941; It would be difficult to ignore the Herbert Committee&apos;s recom-mendation that there should be a limit, and the existence of a limit while preventing the Commons being unduly composed of placemen also ensures a minimum repre-sentation of the Government in the House of Lords.Contractors        : -13. The existing law, prohibiting certain types of Government contractors fromsitting in the*House of Commons, contains some obsolete historical survivals; it also, presents some anomalies, one of which is the distinction between contractorsproviding wares and merchandise (who are disqualified) and those providing services for the Government, such as builders (who are not disqualified). There has,however, been no pressure for any amendment of the law and any attempt to dealwith the matter by root and branch alteration would present formidable difficulties.Furthermore the disqualification of Government contractors was outside the termsof reference of the Herbert Committee, and there are no recommendations from them on.which any major changes could be founded. We have accordingly endorsed the recommendation of the Solicitor-General&apos;s committee that the Bill should re-enact the existing law, subject only to a number of comparatively minor amend-ments including one dealing with one-man companies.Enforcement ...;&apos; T4. An Undertaking has already been given in the House of Commons oftSecond Reading of the Common Informers Bill that the Government will introduce legislation abolishing the procedure of common informer so far as it applies to Parlia-meritary disqualifications. The Sixth Schedule gives effect to this undertaking by repealing the relevant provisions of the statutes concerned. As a substitute,clause 8 Of the Bill gives any individual the right to apply to the Judicial Committeepf the Privy Council for a declaration that an M.P. is disqualified. S; -o: &apos; 15.: I should perhaps add that the Bill does not abolish the common informerin the field of clergy, disqualifications. The fact that this field would not be coveredwas made clear by the Attorney-General during the Second Reading debate on theCommon informers Bill.Relief from Disqualification;)it&apos;: :16, Clause 9 gives effect to the recommendation of the Herbert Committeethat jlii^e^^^^]^^(^erlb^1^e^ for dealing with cases of accidental disqualifica-tidn wk^ut thenqed for an indemnity Bill. The M.P. concerned would be requiredto, divest himself :qftfie:!disqualifying office or contract before the House couldrelieve him of his disqiialffication and the only possible objection to the clause is thatits,-operation,^unlikerithe,passage of a normal Bill, would not involve any referenceto the House of Lords. It might therefore be said that there was a danger thatthere, would be -no safeguard against decisions being unduly influenced by party political cprisideratiqns;;,I.,think we could meet this criticism by reference to para-graph .58 pf: the Herb^;committee&apos;s report. :i^n^J^utjTSlfe law,;, relating to the disqualification of local authorities staffs fromsitting as M.P.&apos;s is full of anomalies. The staffs of English county councils are alldisqualified, but the staffs of county and non-county borough councils are hot sodisqualified.&apos; tQuite different provisions apply in Scotland. The Solicitor-GeneraFscommittee recommended that the clerks and deputy clerks of all county, boroughand county district councils should be prohibited from sitting for any constituencywithin the areas of their employing authority. The draft Bill shows^ in square brackets, a disqualification of this kind.40186 b 2

Members of the Iron and Steel Corporation are included in the first schedule of the Bill and are disqualified absolutely from membership of, the Houseof Commons. Clause 3 (3) of the Bill contains a general provision disqualifyingdirectors of&quot; Government-controlled companies &quot; from l^jBmf^^^^&apos;&quot;^&amp;^pT^of Commons. This general disqualification does not extend to the directors ofsubsidiary (or sub-subsidiary) companies of Government-controlled companiesbecause directors of these concerns are not appointed by the Crown but by thecompanies holding the shares in them. In pursuance of this general principie,the directors of the various companies acquired by the Iron and Steel Corporationare not disqualified by the Bill. ! i    ;21. These companies at present have a large number of part-time directorsand, in view of the close link which will always exist between the Government andthe Corporation, it can be argued that if M.P.&apos;s are eligible to be appointed asdirectors of iron and steel companies a formidable weapon of political patronagewill be in the hands of the Government. &quot;&apos; ;      So h i22. In present circumstances, attention would be more likely to be directed to the position of the present holders of these directorships.rather than.to the usethat the Corporation might in future make of its absolute power over these appoint-ments. If the directors of publicly-owned iron and steel companies were bannedfrom the House of Commons, it might seem to be directed against members of theOpposition who hold these appointments. Perhaps the better course will be toleave the draft Bill in its present form (i.e. not to disqualify the directors of publicly-owned iron and steel companies) and to reconsider the position in the light of any public reactions. ---&quot;-v,:-Recommendations,23. As I have indicated above, the Bill is not yet in final shape: but the drafting is sufficiently far advanced for general decisions to be taken. I accordinglyseek the approval of the Cabinet for the principles embodied in the draft House ofCommons Disqualification Bill attached to this memorandum, and to the initiation of discussions on its provisions with the Opposition. It would not redound to the&apos; credit of the House of Commons if the Bill, which is essentially a House of Gom-mons matter of a non-party character, were to be the subject of acrimoniousdebates in which accusations were bandied across the Floor of the House. Ishould also be glad of the Cabinet&apos;s approval for consultations with the government -ment of Northern Ireland and the adaptations which will have to be includedin Clause .13. After these general discussions with the Opposition and NorthernIreland, the position of local government officers might be discussed with the Idealauthority associations and the Bill could be formally introduced arid publishedtowards the end of the present Session. - :- ^nmhimf- $SIHome Office, teaum vS\ inh iiM.Whitehall, SWA, . -br!?       ,     - :24th February, 1951. r        : :
