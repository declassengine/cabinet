FALKLAND ISLANDS DEPENDENCIES SURVEY
MEMORANDUM BY THE MINISTER OF STATE
The Secretary of State for the Colonies has circulated a memorandum (CP.
(51) 55) concerning the future scale of operations of the Falkland Islands Dependencies
Survey. Officials of his Department and of mine co-operated in the preparation
of this memorandum in order to reduce to a minimum disagreements about facts
and presentation. I still find myself unable, however, to accept my colleague's
conclusions and recommendations. I therefore circulate in the annexed memorandum
alternative conclusions and recommendations, with a short introductory
statement sufficient to indicate my different approach to the subject.
K. G. Y.
Foreign Office, S.W. 1.
19th February, 1951.
ANNEX
The Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is responsible for the administration
of Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (F.I.D.S.) has, in the Annex to his
memorandum, devoted number of paragraphs (notably 18-29) to the practical
difficulties of this task and the expenditure involved. After weighing against the
difficulty and expense the value which this territory represents, he concludes that
he would not be justified in recommending in future the maintenance of more than
four bases. He further recommends that, in future, he and the Governor of the
Falkland Islands should determine the programmes of F.I.D.S. without reference
to other Departments, provided that this minimum number of four bases is maintained.
2. From the point of view of the Foreign Office, the basic facts are that this
is British territory on which two foreign Powers, Argentina and Chile, are trespassing
flagrantly, whilst at the same time ignoring our offer to submit the dispute for
settlement by the International Court. If His Majesty's Government are not going
to withdraw altogether from this disputed area, we must—
(a) do our utmost to maintain our legal position by acts of administration
and occupation and
(b) protect our political position in such a way as to discourage our rivals in
this area or elsewhere, from believing that we do not mean to stay.
In the latter connexion it should be borne in mind that Argentina is one
of the ringleaders in a general campaign against the Colonial possessions
of European Powers in the Western Hemisphere, and that other
Powers interested in other areas of the globe, have not been slow to
carry a similar campaign into the United Nations, especially in the
Trusteeship Committee of the General Assembly.
3. The view of the Foreign Office is that the position of His Majesty's
Government in Antarctica must be adequately maintained and that for this purpose
the scale of activity proposed by the Colonial Office is inadequate. If the Foreign
Office view is accepted, it follows that ways and means must be found, within the
limits imposed, of course, by our resources and the fulfilment of objectives of more
40142
immediate importance, to overcome the difficulties and meet the expenses to which
trie Colonial Office refer. In this connexion it is suggested, as a subject for further
investigation if the Foreign Office recommendations are approved,
(a) that the financial estimate in paragraph 27 of the Annex to the memorandum
by the Secretary of State for the Colonies is based on
experience of two unusually severe ice seasons,
(b) that the need to use vessels of special construction (or specially adapted)
has been, overstated in paragraph 20. Between 1947-50, Argentina
and Chile employed 41 different vessels in the northern parts of the
Dependencies, none of which were of this type.
4. The Colonial Office would, however, like it to be stated that in their
opinion, it is not possible in the present state of knowledge to be dogmatic about
future weather conditions in Antarctica; that it is therefore essential to equip
expeditions to deal with the worst which experience has shown may occur; and that
the question of ways and means would have to be studied further in detail by the
Colonial Office if the Cabinet were to accept the views expressed in this
memorandum.
CONCLUSIONS
5. It is essential that we should prevent our legal title from diminishing further,
in order to maintain our position, not only vis-a-vis Argentina and Chile, but also
against the day when settlement of the dispute becomes possible, either through the
jurisdiction of the International Court at The Hague or through the setting up of
some kind of international regime in the area. As stated in paragraphs 11 and 8
of the Annex to the memorandum by the Colonial Secretary, neither of these two
solutions seems likely to come about in the near future and, therefore, everything
depends at the moment on actual physical occupation. Starting from this premise,
our conclusion is that the present declining trend of our activity in the Falkland
Islands Dependencies should be arrested and that the maintenance of four bases,
only one of which might be on the mainland of Graham Land (and no mainland
base is occupied at present or proposed for next season) is insufficient for the
purpose outlined above. While the Foreign Office do not desire to make any hard
and fast rule about the number of occupied bases to be maintained, since their
efficacy, in any case, depends to a large extent on their deployment, they feel that
the minimum should be six bases, two of which would be on the mainland. It is
obvious that the local revenue and resources of F.I.D.S. are not sufficient to sustain
this scale of activity, if it is approved, and some steps will have to be taken to
supplement them.
RECOMMENDATIONS
6. In view of the above the following course of action is suggested: 
(a) A directive should be issued to the Governor in the following terms: 
The number of occupied bases in the Dependencies should never fall below six.
of which two should, if possible, be placed at suitable points on the
mainland in order that sledging parties may from time to time patrol
and investigate the whole area of Graham Land. The exact location of
the bases will be reviewed every year by the Secretary of State for the
Colonies in agreement with the Foreign Office and if necessary with
other interested Departments.
(b) F.I.D.S. should be regarded as an imperial commitment and should not
depend on the revenue of the Falkland Islands Dependencies alone. If
this is agreed the Colonial Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer should
consult together in order to come to a working arrangement whereby local resources
may be supplemented from the United Kingdom.
(c) Another ship should be purchased with United Kingdom funds. This need
not be specially adapted to serve in Antarctic waters, but could be used for the more
accessible bases, thus releasing the John Biscoe to serve the remoter ones.
(d) The foregoing arrangements would hold good until some major change in
the international or strategic circumstances made a further review by Ministers
desirable.
