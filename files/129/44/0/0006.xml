(51) 69th January, 1951CABINETCOAL MINERS: RELEASE OF VOLUNTEERS FROM THE ARMEDFORCESMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power attach a memorandum submitted to the Official Coal Committee by theMinistry of Labour on the release from the Armed Forces of miners who havevolunteered as Regulars. &quot;This memorandum has been considered by the officialCoal Committee. While the Committee do not say that this scheme is impracticable,it is only fair to record that in an earlier report circulated with CP. (50) 297, theCommittee made it clear that they did not recommend the proposal that volunteers .should be allowed to return from the Services to the pits.2. I think the Cabinet should consider this scheme against the general coal &apos;situation as it is to-day:-(a) We are faced with the probability of a severe fuel crisis in the next threemonths.(b) Unless present trends are reversed, we shall get much less coal from the*    mines in 1951 than we have had in 1950.3. To meet the fuel crisis we have called on the miners to produce an additional3 million tons. This target will be very difficult to reach. If, as is probable, man-power falls further during these months, it will be quite impossible for the miners togive this output. Even if only a small number of men return from the Forces to the pits, this will have a definite importance in direct effect on output. It will have amuch greater psychological importance in persuading other men to stay in the mines.4. The same applies to the building up of man-power throughout the rest ofthe year. It will certainly be much easier to persuade miners&apos; lodges to accept Italiansor other foreign workers if we have returned the volunteers from the Forces.5. I must emphasise again that for the next two or three years man-power isthe overriding problem in securing the increase of coal which we must have.As I have already explained in CP. (50) 302, the Ministry of Labour have fore-cast that next year mining man-power will have declined by another 20,000. Wecannot possibly accept this position. We made a mistake last year in accepting theMinistry of Labour estimate of a decline in man-power and we must not make thesame mistake again. Even if we got 20,000 more instead of 20,000 less workers, our exports would be far below this year&apos;s level. But where are we to get even these40,000 additional workers? Frankly I must put this question to my colleagues for i cannot answer it myself except by saying that we must take any and every practicablestep, and I think this is one, to improve the position.conclusion. I accordingly recommend that the scheme proposed in this memorandum should be adopted on the following understandings:  (a) Release should be offered to men who have been employed in the mineseither above or below ground, and who have been in the Forces fur notmore than two years..39919    &apos;
(b) Men who subsequently leave the pits and are in consequence recalled to theForces should be allowed to deduct from the unexpired period of theirv.   .,     colour service the period spent in the mines.(c) The initiative should be taken by the Government authorities, i.e., ex-minervolunteers should be approached and urged to return to the mines onthe ground that that is now the most important form of national service which they can give.:/..- P. J. N.-B.Ministry of Fuel and Power, SWA,9th January, 1951.ANNEXOfficial Coal CommitteeRELEASE OF VOLUNTEERS FROM THE forces memorandum by the Ministry of Labour and National service. The Ministry of Labour has considered, in consultation with the otherDepartments concerned, whether it is practicable to devise an effective scheme bywhich miners who had recently volunteered for service in the Forces could, if theywere willing, return to the pits. The conclusion is that a scheme on the following lines would be administratively practicable. There is a difference of view as to itseffectiveness and as to its desirability on grounds of policy (see paragraphs 9 and 10).Scope2. If the principle of release of volunteers is adopted, all Departments except the Ministry of Fuel and Power suggest that the opportunity of release to returnto underground work in the coal mines should be confined to men in the regular forces who have:  (1) at some time before joining the Forces been employed in underground coal-mining for at least six months, and(2) been in the Forces for not longer than twelve months.The Ministry of Fuel and Power take the view that release should be open tomen who have been employed in coalmining either above or below ground for any period, and who have been in the Forces not more than two years.All Departments are agreed that the opportunity of release should be confined to men below the rank of sergeant in the Army or its equivalent in the other services.Area of Work3. Man who volunteer for release for the mines should be invited to specifythe area in which they would prefer to be employed and the other mining areas, ifany, in which they are prepared to take employment. They would, if possible, beplaced in their area of preference, but if this were not possible they would be released from the Forces only if they were prepared to go to an area in which the national coal Board wished to employ them.Control -4. The Ministry of Fuel and Power would take steps, in consultation with thedistrict representatives of the National Coal Board, to obtain suitable vacanciesfor ex-miners vohinteering-for release and would apply for the release of individualmen only when this had been done.; : 5. The Ministry of Fuel and Power would also take steps to ensure that minersreleased in fact took up the specified employment. Thereafter the National coal board would be responsible for informing the Ministry of Fuel arid Power withoutdelay of any of these men who left the mines or who expressed a wish to returnto the Forces. In addition, the Ministry of Fuel and Power would arrange with the
National Coal Board for periodical checks to be made to ensure that all men released and not reported as having left the mines were in fact still in coalminingemployment.6. The Services would make it clear to volunteers that they were being released only for the specific purpose of taking up underground employment inthe mines, and that if they left this employment before the date on which their period of colour service was due to expire they would be liable to recall to theForces.Any men found to have left coalmining employment or who wished to returnto the Forces would be promptly reported to the appropriate Service Departmentwhich would ordinarily require men to return. Any who did not return would befollowed up as deserters in the ordinary way.7. The Minister of Labour, the Service Departments and the Ministry of fuel and Power consider that any men released who did not remain in coalminingemployment until the date on which their colour service was due to end should be liable to recall to the Forces for the balance of their colour service, though if bythis time they were near to the end of their period of colour service, the service departments might not think it worth while to recall them. The representative ofthe Ministry of Defence, on the other hand, took the view that men released who did not stay in the mines until what would otherwise be the end of their colourservice should be liable to recall to the Forces for the whole remaining period oftheir colour service, that is, without deducting the time spent in the mines. TheMinistry of Defence take this view on the ground that in many cases the services would otherwise, after account has been taken of the time that would be requiredfor re-training, get little or no colour service, of value from these men, though theywould be useful Reserves. The Ministry of Fuel and Power fear, on the otherhand, that such a condition would make the scheme so unattractive that little or no response could be expected, and the Service Departments are prepared to operatea scheme under which the period spent in the mines would count as colour service.All are agreed that men who stay in the coal mines until the end of what would otherwise be their periods of colour service would be of no value as Reservists andshould be discharged from the Forces and not entitled to receive the paymentswhfch would otherwise be made in respect of their Reserve service.8. It is agreed that a scheme on these lines would, administratively, be practicable. It would not involve any implication that direction of labour was being introduced in this sphere as the sanction which would be applied to men who left the mines would derive simply from the fact that they were members of the regular forces who had for a special reason been released from their contract withoutpaying the amount normally required as compensation. A scheme on these lineswas, in fact, successfully operated in relation to Regulars as well as men who hadbeen called up to the Forces as recently as the end of 1948 and some of the Regularswho were released to the coal mines under this scheme are at the present time beingrecalled to the Forces, either because they have left coalmining employment or because they have expressed a wish to be recalled.9. On the question whether such a scheme would be effective there is a difference of opinion. The Ministry of Fuel and and Power, on the one hand, thinkthat a scheme on these lines would produce sufficient numbers to make it worthwhile and would therefore be effective for the purpose for which it is designed. TheMinistry of Defence and the Ministry of Labour and National Service, on the otherhand, feel that the numbers likely to be obtained for the coal mines would not be large enough to justify the ill-effects the scheme would have on general recruitment for the Forces, and that the scheme, though practicable, could not be said to be effective.10. The Ministry of Defence point out that even if the present assumptions about the trend of future recruitment prove to be justified, the size of the RegularArmy is likely to decline during the year 1951-52. Any scheme aimed to bring pressure on men now in the forces to return to coalmining is bound to have an adverse moral effect on a recruiting campaign on which the whole success of ourrearmament programme depends. The Ministry of Defence are accordinglystrongly opposed to any proposal of the kind in question.Ministry of Labour and National Service,19th December, 1950.
