PROPOSALS FOR A PRESS council memorandum by the Lord President of the council I have received from the Newspaper Society a copy of the draft proposals for a press Council which were prepared by the Newspaper Society, the newspaper proprietors Association, the Scottish Daily Newspaper Society and the ScottishNewspaper Proprietors Association (annexed). These proposals were communi-cated to the Guild of British Newspaper Editors, the Institute of Journalists andthe National Union of Journalists on 12th January.2. The objects of the Council outlined in the draft proposals are broadly speaking those which were visualised by the Royal Commission on the Press, exceptthat:-(a) the proposals of the Royal Commission for building up a code in accordancewith the highest professional standards by censuring undesirable types of journalistic conduct and by all other possible means have beenr whittled down;(b) the Council is to be required to consider only complaints from individualsactually affected;(c) the recommendation of the Commission that the Council should examinethe practicability of a comprehensive pension scheme for journalists isnot mentioned.3. In other matters the draft proposals depart from the Royal Commission^recommendations in the following important respects:  (a) it is proposed that the chairman of the Council shall be in turn theChairman of the Newspaper Proprietors Association and the Presidentof the Newspaper Society instead of a lay chairman appointed by theLord Chief Justice and the Lord President of the Court of Session;(b) no provision is made for the appointment of lay members of the Council;(c) half the members are to be managerial members instead of the thirdvisualised by the Royal Commission, and of the twelve editorialmembers seven are to be appointed by organisations representing the newspaper proprietors;(d) the secretarial work of the Council is, until otherwise decided, to be carriedout jointly by the secretaries of the Newspaper Proprietors association and the Newspaper Society. Secretarial arrangements were not men-tioned in the Royal Commission^ report, but those proposed areunsatisfactory.4. The effect of these departures from the recommendations of the RoyalCommission is to make the influence of the newspaper proprietors preponderatein the Press Council. The National Union of Journalists has already stated that itcannot accept these proposals and I am sure that they will be equally unacceptable to many of our supporters. Apart from the political objections, a Press Councilof the type proposed would be unlikely to bring about any reforms in the press and might well, by serving as a cloak for the continuance of present practices andby strengthening the influence of the big newspaper proprietors, do more harm than good.39963THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENT58Printed for the Cabinet.

5. I am sure, therefore, that we cannot accept the proposals in their present form. I am equally sure that in the present international and parliamentary situa-tion we should try and avoid legislation which would certainly be opposed by theConservative Opposition who, although they did not challenge the government motion, made it clear in the debate on 28th July, 1949, that in their opinion the setting up of a Press Council should be left to the press itself. If we rule out theacceptance of the proposals and the early introduction of legislation we mustchoose between-(i) rejecting the proposals out of hand and taking no further steps to setup a Press Council; o(ii) trying to secure their modification.6. The first course would play into the hands of the newspaper proprietorswho have all along been on the lookout for any slip on our part. It would probablybe unacceptable to the House of Commons, which has already passed without a division the resolution expressing approval of the recommendations of the RoyalCommission, and it would be regarded by many people as an undignified retreaton the part of the Government.7. I therefore recommend that we should seek modification of the proposals on the points mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 3 above. I hope, but without any great confidence, that the organisations representing the newspaper proprietorswould be prepared to accept such modifications While the proposals are still indraft form, and if my colleagues agree I propose to inform them that their present draft proposals are unacceptable to the Government and to suggest modifications in the sense of the Royal Commission^ recommendations.H.
