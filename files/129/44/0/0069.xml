-   34S    this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp.(51) 69 COPY NO. 36TH MARCH, 1951CABINETNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HOUSE workers memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the usual function of a professional institute is the maintenanceof proper standards, for example, by granting diplomas on the resultsof examinations which it conducts.     The National Institute of House-workers goes beyond this, first by training women and girls for domesticwork, and secondly by running a Daily Houseworker Service.    It is thecost and negligible influence of these two functions which have for sometime been of concern to me and my predecessor, as well as to theCommittee on Public Accounts and responsible sections of the Press.2. Training.       Training courses lasting six or nine months(according to the age of the worker) are given in residential centres.It costs the taxpayer  160 to train a worker aged 17 or over, and no lessthan  210 to train one who is under 17.    Trainees do not have to give any undertaking as to how long they will stay in domestic service, nor arethey under any compulsion to enter those forms of domestic service which are most valuable to the community.    A large proportion of themmarry within a few years of completing their courses, and their services are lost to the community at large.    Allowing for this, the 700 women whohave been trained so far are a drop in the ocean as far as the main problem is concerned.3. There is no doubt that training of this kind should properly becarried out by local education authorities.    Indeed, this was recognised in the Markham-Hancock Report.     The fact that there is ho sign of localeducation authorities giving the kind of training now provided by the institute suggests that they do not feel able to give high priority to it inpresent circumstances.     I think they are right in this, and I regard it asanomalous that the Institute should do it for them.    Nor can I lose sight of the fact that while the Instituted courses are 100 per cent grant-aided,similar courses run by local education authorities would attract only60 per cent grant.4. Daily Houseworker Service.        This is carried on at thirteencentres throughout the country.    Employers pay 2s. 6d an-hour, plus a contribution to travelling expenses.     Only 1,100 families a year (out ofsome 15 million in the country) now benefit from the Service.     My pre-predecessor approved the provision for the Institute in the 1950-51 Estimateon the understanding that the Daily Houseworker Service would be madeto pay its way.   It is not doing so yet;   indeed, on the latest detailed information supplied to the Treasury, it appears that the current annual rate of loss is  12,000, representing a loss of about  lOfor each house-hold served during a year, or  40 for each worker.
5. I consider this subsidy to particular households quite unjustified,not because I am under any impression that it is a matter of adding to theluxury of the well-to-do classes, but because local health authorities areempowered by section 29 of the National Health Service Act, 1946, toprovide domestic help in households where it is needed for certain specified reasons.     These are &quot;the presence of any person who is ill,lying-in, an expectant mother, mentally defective, aged, or a child notover compulsory school age.....&quot;.     In my view, this list covers all thecircumstances in which there is justification for providing domestic helpat a loss to public funds.6. It has been represented to me that the Daily Houseworter service will help to release women for defence work,    If each Daily Houseworkerreleased another woman for rearmament work, the gain to the labour force would only be about 300.    I cannot believe that so few would have any effect on the difficult problem of mobilising labour.7. The Third Report of the Committee on Public Accounts(1948-49) ended its reference to the National Institute of Houseworkerswith the following words:-&quot;Though your Committee do not express any opinion onthe value of the objects sought to be attained as a long-term policy, the benefits of the scheme appear to accrue at present to a small number of employers and workers rather than tothe community as a whole.     They recommend, therefore,that the development of the scheme should be closely watchedby the Treasury, with a view to determining whether theresults likely to be secured in present conditions arecommensurate with the expenditure involved&quot;.^* Cost.      In the last five years the Institute has spent over .2 million, and to judge by the  1 million provided in Estimates for thatperiod, it is-intended to spend even more.    Such concrete achievementsas it has to its credit do not seem to me to represent value for money.Nor do I foresee any possibility of a wider diffusion of the Institutedbenefits within the next decade or so.    If anything more than the fringeof the problem is to be touched, its activities must be considerablyexpanded at even greater cost to the taxpayer.    I cannot contemplatethis in present circumstances.     Indeed, against the background of mybudgetary responsibilities, I do not consider that expenditure of  200,000in 1951-52 represents a justifiable use of public funds.     I agree that ineasier times this would be a desirable service, but we have reached thepoint when what is merely desirable must make way for what is essential.9. I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that the activities of theNational Institute of Houseworkers should be brought to an end as soonas possible.H.G.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,6TH MARCH, 1951.
