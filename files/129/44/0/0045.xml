THIS   DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF ,,HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENT g j JPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1951SECRET Copy No.    31CP. (51) 45%th February, 1951CABINETWAR criminals memorandum by the Attorney-general  feel that I should explain to my colleagues the reasons why I have felt obligedto call attention to the recent statement by the United Kingdom High commissioner in Germany on the review of sentences passed on German war criminals.2. In 1945 two distinguished British Judges, together with Sir David maxwell fyfe and myself, were appointed by the Government to take part in the trial of the major war criminals at Nuremberg. We were persuaded to engage in this taskbecause we believed the process to be both lawful and just. The crimes committed by these men were of the most frightful nature. Subsequently, the United KingdomGovernment also established Military Courts to try war criminals in the british zone of Germany. In general these Courts conducted their cases with conspicuouscare and their sentences were carefully reviewed before confirmation.3. It is against this background that the British High Commissioner inGermany, in dealing with the review of sentences imposed on all war criminals, hasadmittedly said that &quot; hatred and revenge are bad counsellors.&quot; I have been unableto discover any possible interpretation of these words other than the suggestion thathatred and revenge entered into the sentences. Such a statement about any BritishCourt would constitute a grave contempt and I am bound to say that I have reasonto think that the American and British Judges and Prosecutors feel it unfortunate that such a statement should have been made. I make the strongest protest aboutthe use of such language in connection with such atrocious crimes.4. My concern in the matter is, however, neither legalistic nor personal it ispolitical. I feel that the proposed review of sentences disclosed a complete failure to recognise the political implications of such action. It is not to be doubted that both in this country, in Western Europe and obviously in Eastern Europe there isanxiety about the proposals for the rearmament of Western Europe. OurCommunist opponents are making effective propaganda about the matter: in eastern Europe the traditional fear of German military power is perhaps theone thing which can most unite Communists and non-Communists: in thiscountry and in Western Europe great play is being made with the expression,&quot; rearming the Nazis.&quot; That this moment should be selected for releasing Krupp(who would have been included amongst the major war criminals at Nuremberg,as the Americans strongly urged at the time, but for the delay which this would have involved) and for canvassing the possibility of releasing other Nazi war criminals,including leading Admirals and Generals, will inevitably result in the proposedrearmament of Western Germany being capable of presentation by our opponentsin a much more sinister light.5. The British High Commissioner^ statement has been widely reported inthe Press, and according to these reports he was asked about the major war criminals in Spandau and having said that, he saw no reason why their sentencesshould not be reviewed, he added (and what follows is reported in inverted commasin the Daily Herald report): &quot; Unfortunately the Western High Commissioners havenot got sole control. We can do nothing without Russian approval. A four-Power401021
agreement is needed to illustrate that hatred and revenge are bad counsellors. Thereis no man in prison in Germany whose sentence I will not be willing to consider inview of the changed circumstances.&quot; I observe that there are major discrepanciesbetween this report and the one contained in paragraph 1.2 of the Minister of State&apos;smemorandum (CP. (51) 38). If the statement as published in the Press which?v o referred to the &quot; changed circumstances &quot; and which clearly indicated an intentionL t to review the Nuremberg sentences was inaccurate, it is a pity it was not promptlycorrected. If it was accurate, one would wish to enquire what is the change in circumstances which made the crimes of these men so odious four years ago lessodious now and how it happened that contrary to the intention qf the government not to initiate a review of the Nuremberg sentences he expressed a personal opinion in favour of review, he being the person to whom, personally, powers of clemencyhad been delegated.6. I note, indeed, that it is stated in paragraph 12 of the Ministers statement,that what appears there is the most accurate account of what the High Commissionersaid. But is this so? Or is the &quot; INTEL &quot; No. 14 sent by the Foreign Office on24th January to our representatives abroad inaccurate?   This states that:&quot; In a speech to the British Press Club .... the British High Commissionerindicated that he was reviewing sentences on war criminals in the british zone. He also expressed the view that the time was due for an attempt to bemade to review sentences of those top Nazi war criminals now held in theSpandau Prison i.e., Hess, Raeder, Doenitz, Von Neurath, Speer,.VonSchirach and Funk.How an official was able to make this statement in view of the Minister of State&apos;sdenial that the British Government intend to initiate such a review I do not under-stand.7. I can well understand that from time to time long sentences should be reviewed. I think the Home Office practice is to review every four years and alsoto consult the trial Judge. I was not, I think, aware that a War Crimes ReviewBoard had been established in 1949, but I believe it was presided over by Major-General Wade and carried out its functions with scrupulous care. Its object, how-ever, is stated in paragraph 4 of the Minister of State&apos;s paper to have been thelaudable one of securing, as far as possible, uniformity of punishment amongprisoners sentenced by British Courts, a matter already no doubt considered by theauthority which in the first place reviewed the sentences before confirmation. this board presumably achieved its object of securing uniformity. Fifty-eight sentenceswere reduced. I say nothing of the further twenty-seven cases which have &quot; bene-fited by clemency &quot; since then, but I cannot understand why, after leis than a year,it should be necessary to establish a new &quot; Clemency Board &quot; (the constitution ofwhich is not stated) to do again what had already been done, namely, ensureuniformity (cf. paragraphs 9 and 11 of the Minister of State&apos;s paper).8. I observe with uneasiness that the Minister of State says that Germanfeeling about the war criminals is based on two simple contentions:  (a) That it is morally wrong for the victors to try and condemn the vanquished;(b) That the defence of acting on superior instructions should have been givenfar more weight in respect of Service personnel.I hope that the Foreign Office will not fail to refute those mischievous contentions.I assume that this is what is meant in paragraph 11 of the Minister of State&apos;s paperwhen he expresses the view that &quot; nothing should be left undone which would help to place the question of war crimes in its true light in Germany.&quot; If indeed thatis not the meaning of the expression it might be helpful to enquire what the &quot;truelight &quot; is or whether the word &quot; true &quot; is a misprint for &quot; new.&quot;9. As to the case of Von Manstein, I am quite unable to understand why the sentence of 12 years imprisonment (reduced from 18 years on a review 18 months ago) should now again be the subject of review. My colleagues will not forget the remarkable delays which were encountered in bringing this man to a trial in whichremarkable efforts were made to secure his acquittal. I observe that in the 7 deathsentences which the American authorities have decided to carry out are included the cases of four individuals concerned in Einsatz Gruppe D Which operated inVon ManstehVs area and was subject to his authority. He was himself convictedbut leniently dealt with for neglecting his duty to prevent the abominable massmurders these individuals committed.
10. It occurs to me finally to wonder whether the &quot; right&quot; people in germany are really so anxious about the welfare of the Nazi war criminals. After thenotorious Use Koch (sentenced by an American Court for shocking crimes) hadbeen released by American executive action, she was retried by a German Courtwhose decision to sentence her to life imprisonment was reported the day beforethe release of Von Krupp. But then, of course, she did not move much in thecircle of Admirals, Generals or Armament manufacturers. Is the explanation ofthe whole thing, repeating the experience after the 1914-18 war, contained inparagraph 2 of &quot;Intel&quot; 14, as follows: &quot;Germans themselves have latterly been pressing strongly for a review of all war crime sentences and in some cases com-plete amnesty. They tend to see it as a necessary condition of a German contribu-tion to Western Defence since most of the war criminals serving sentences in theBritish Zone are ex-members of the German armed forces (including the S.S.)whose &apos; honour&apos; they consider should be restored before they are called upon tofight again.&quot;I would not myself care to be a party to rehabilitating the &quot;honour &quot; of the nazis and S.S. men in this way.H.
