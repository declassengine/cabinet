HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp.(51) 52 COPY NO. 3113TH FEBRUARY, 1951CABINETFULL, EMPLOYMENT bill memorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilIn the King&apos;s Speech we promised legislation to make availableto Ministers, on a permanent basis, powers to regular production, dis-tribution and consumption and to control prices.     When a Bill on theselines came before the Cabinet on 30th October, 1950, a Committee ofMinisters were asked to examine whether positive powers to maintainfull employment and secure effective economic planning should not beintroduced into the Bill (CM.(50) 69th Conclusions, Minute 5).2. This Committee of Ministers met shortly afterwards and had avery full discussion of the forms which positive powers might take.Since it was desirable to knit together the positive and negative powersinto a coherent whole, it was felt that the emphasis in the Bill should beon the maintenance of full employment rather than on economic planning.The matter was then remitted to an official Committee to work out indetai 1,3. The official Committee recently submitted to the ministerial committee a report on the positive powers which might be taken,together with the draft of a  Full Employment Bill which incorporatedtheir proposals.     Broadly speaking, the Bill would have included powers for the stimulation, when economic activity appears to be flagging, of investment in the private sector of industry, for the public purchase inthese circumstances of capital goods and for the encouragement of investment by public authorities.     The Bill also provided for thepreparation, in advance of any recession, of detailed plans for capital investment by local authorities and socialised industries.     For therest, the Bill made permanent the negative controls and powers of price control which were contained in the draft Bill circulated to the cabinet with CP.(50) 178, but reorientated the?e powers to have regard to the primary object of the measure, namely, the maintenance of full employ-ment.4. There has been a considerable change in circumstances sincethe Cabinet, in October last, considered the form of the legislation required for full employment a.ud economic planning.    At that time it was reasonable to contemplate the ending, within a measurable period, ofmany of the emergency powers (such as the requisitioning of property)which had been continued since the war period;   and it was thereforeright to be considering the form in which those economic controls whichwere required permanently should be retained.     Moreover, the threat of some slackening of economic activity, here or in the world at large,was sufficiently real to make it&apos;desirable to arm ourselves with the
necessary powers to fulfil our pledge to maintain full employment inthis country under conditions which would have resulted in massunemployment in pre-war days.5, In all these respects, conditions have radically changed in the intervening months.The defence programme requires the continued use of manyemergency powers, including powers of requisitioning, and indeed wehave found it necessary to introduce the Supplies and Services  (defence purposes) Bill to make it plain that the powers which survive from thewar can be used for defence purposes.     There might be considerableconfusion if permanent powers of economic control were being taken for peace-time purposes while wider and overlapping powers of control,including economic controls, were being continued on a year-to-year basisto deal with defence needs and with the consequences of those scarcitieswhich rearmament throughout the world is creating.     If economic con-trols were placed on a permanent basis under the proposed Bill, and theemergency basis for these controls was dispensed with, we might reach a position in which, in the name of full employment but in fact to imple-ment the defence programme, instruments made under the new legislation were throwing considerable numbers out of work for a time becausesupplies were having to be diverted from inessential to essential work.Moreover, any danger to full employment has been relegatedto a relatively distant future.     If employment in some industries is in danger, it is through a scarcity of supplies.     A Bill which was designedto stimulate demand would not be regarded by Parliament or the country as relevant to our current problems.Perhaps I might add the practical consideration that theChancellor of the Exchequer, who would be departmental ly responsiblefor the drafting of this Bill, will be heavily involved in financial business in the next few months.6. The conclusion which the Ministerial Committee reached wasthat the  Full Employment Bill should not be introduced in presentcircumstances.     Meantime, however, if the Cabinet approve, theCommittee will go into the matter further with a view to legislationbeing framed which can be introduced when a suitable time arrives, ifnecessary later in the present Session.     I put forward these recommen-dationsfor the Cabinefs approval.H.M.Privy Council Office, S.W.1,13TH FEBRUARY, 1951.
