CP.(51) 60 COPY NO.26TH FEBRUARY, 1951CABINETSOVIET PROPOSAL FOR A MEETING OF FOREIGN minister&apos;s memorandum by the Minister of StateMy colleagues will remember that on the 15th February(C. M. (53) 14th Conclusions, Minute 4) they considered the terms of a draft Note,to the Sov et Government in reply to the Soviet Note of the 5th February.   the note, after amendment, was presented by H. Ivi. Ambassador at Moscow to theSoviet Foreign Minister on the 19th February.    The text of the&apos; Note as presented is attached as an Annex to this memorandum.2. That Note, to which no reply has yet been received, suggested thata preliminary conference of representatives of the Four Powers be held in Parison the 5th March.   The purpose of the preliminary conference, as already agreed by the Soviet Government in its Note of the 5th February, would be to draw up an agenda for a subsequent meeting cf Foreign Ministers.   The Soviet Note stipulated that the preliminary conference should also be responsible for &quot;the establishmentof the order of examination of questions&quot;, but that &quot;the substance of the questions to be included in the agenda must not enter into the tasks of the preliminary conference&quot;.    The three Western Powers, in their replies, have agreed that&quot;the formulation of.....subjects which may be agreed upon as well as their order on the agenda will naturally be considered by the preliminary conference&quot;.3. My colleagues will remember that the Soviet Governmentsoriginal proposal in November, 1950, was for a meeting of the Council of foreign ministers to consider &quot;the question of the carrying out of the decisions of the potsdam Conference regarding the demilitarisation of Germany&quot;.   It seems likely, therefore, that the Soviet representative at the preliminary conference willtry to have the agenda so arranged that, the first item will be concerned with the demilitarisation of Germany, under which the Soviet Government would seek toindict as a breach of the Potsdam Agreement the policy of the V/estern powers in planning for a German contribution to Western Defence.    The soviet representative may also try to establish the point that the Foreign Ministersmust have an exhaustive discussion on each item of the agenda, in the order inwhich it appears, before proceeding to consider the next item.4, Such a procedure would not be acceptable.    The Cabinet hasalready expressed the view (CM. (51) 11th Conclusions, Minute 6) that, whileevery effort should be made to secure that the proposed meeting is held, it wouldnot be practicable to proceed with the meeting if the Soviet Government insisted on confining the agenda to the demilitarisation of Germany and other purelyGerman problems.    The Cabinet has also already agreed (C. M. (51) 10thConclusions, Minute 4) that the demilitarisation of Germany must be considered in the general context of disarmament.5. 1 The Western Powers have moreover consistently maintained,throughout the correspondence on this subject with the Soviet Government, thatany Four-Power discussions should include the principal problems whosesolution would make possible a real and la.sting improvement in the relations[US DOCUMENT-IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET31
between the Four Powers and the elimination of the causes of present inter-national, tension throughout the world,   The agetfda must therefore be framed interms wide enough to permit us to raise all the aspects of Soviet policy whichcontribute to the present state of international relations.   In particular, it seems desirable that the first item of the agenda should be so phrased that a general statement of the Western case can be made at the start of the meeting.   In their -Notes presented on the&apos;19th February the Western Powers have specificallysuggested an agenda which will cover the causes of tension in Europe includingthe existing level of armaments, problems affecting Germany and the Austrian treaty.   In general, it is pre.fera.ble that the agenda should be relatively short and limited to a few broad headings rather than long and detailed.    The main point is that the discussions must be so widened as to make sure that the western powers could obtain Soviet counter-concessions, over the broadest possible fieldif they were to contemplate any reconsideration of present plans for Germany.6. It would in my view serve no useful purpose to try to define closelyat present the terms of the agenda which, we should wish to see adopted.   Muchwill depend on the attitude adopted by the Soviet representative at the preliminary conference.   It will also be desirable for the United Kingdom representative tohold a further exchange of views with the United States and french representatives before the preliminary conference opens.7. I suggest that we should seek to avoid the inclusion on the agenda of any item referring specifically to the Far East, since Far Eastern questions are already under consideration at the United Nations, and since we do not wish byoverloading the agenda with controversial items, to suggest that we are notsincere in these negotiations.    The omission of an item referring specifically to the Far East would not, of course, preclude us from raising Far Easternquestions under a more general item of the agenda at the meeting of Ministers,if it suited us to do so at the time.    I also suggest that, until we know whether theSoviet Government will accept an agenda wide enough for our needs, we shouldnot commit ourselves to agree that the meeting be called a meeting of the Councilof Foreign Ministers, since the terms of reference of that body might otherwiseallow the Soviet Government unduly to restrict the scope of the discussion.8. It does not seem possible to go further or to lay down in advance the tactics which the United Kingdom representative should, adopt at the preliminary conference.9. The Foreign Secretary has decided, with the approval of the PrimeMinister, to appoint the Parliamentary Under-Secretary- of State for ForeignAffairs, Mr. Ernest Davies, to be the United Kingdom representative at thepreliminary conference.10. I recommend that my colleagues agree, on the assumption that an affirmative reply is meanwhile received from the.Soviet Government, thatMr. Davies should be authorised to negotiate for an agenda within the generalframework of the policy set out above.-  K.G. Y .Foreign Office, S. W. 1. ,26TH FEBRUARY, 1951.
ANNEXText of His Majesty&apos;s Governments Note of19th February, 1951, to the Soviet GovernmentHis Majesty&apos;s Embassy have the honour to acknowledge the receiptof the Note of February 5th, 1951, of the Soviet Minister for Foreign Affairs andunder instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Principal Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to reply as follows:His Majesty&apos;s Government regret that the Soviet Government inits reply repeats and further exaggerates inaccurate statements about the policies and motives of the United Kingdom, France and the United States, aswell as the German Federal Republic.    The Soviet allegations are totallywithout foundation.The attempt to eliminate the causes of international tension is a subject which so deeply touches the interests of all peoples that it demands themost serious and honest consideration.   Clearly, if these causes are to be eliminated, they must first be correctly identified.It is obvious that it is not the German problem or theconsideration of a German contribution to the defence of &quot;Western Europe which lies at the root of the present tension.   His Majesty&apos;s Government wish toemphasise moreover that in Western Germany there do not exist any german military forces, or any German war industry, and that the only fait accompliin this field in Europe, is the existence of the huge armaments maintained by theSoviet bloc which includes forces raised in Eastern Germany.    In short, asHis Majesty&apos;s Government stated in their Note of December 22nd, the serioustension which exists at present arises in the first instance from the general attitude adopted by the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republicssince the end of the war.The Soviet Government has referred to the Defence Programmeundertaken by the United Kingdom, the United States and the free nations ofEurope.    It must be as apparent to the Soviet Government as it is to worldpublic opinion, that the free nations of the world, confronted with the vast armed forces maintained by the Soviet Union and the nations under its control, and in face of the frustration by the Soviet Government of the sincere efforts of alarge majority of the members of the United Nations to obtain the effectiveinternational control and reduction of armaments, have no course except tomove to redress for their own security the great disparity in armed forcesexisting in the world.His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to ensure that the discussion at any meeting of the four Ministers shall include these real causes of tensionand that a suitable agenda to that end be drawn up.   Since the Soviet Govern-ment had admitted the possibility of discussing questions other than Germanyand has itself drawn attention to that of armaments, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-rnent which desired to raise this question assume that the Soviet government does not object to the representatives of the four Governments in thepreliminary conversations preparing an agenda which will cover the causes of tension in Europe including the existing level of armaments, problems affecting Germany and the Austrian Treaty.    The formulation of these andother subjects which may be agreed upon as&quot;well as their order on the agendawill naturally be considered by the preliminary conference.
- If the Soviet Government agrees with the basis outlined above for a preliminary conference in Paris, His Majesty1 s Governmentsuggest that the representatives of the four Powers  meet there on March 5th.If. as His Majesty&apos;s Government hope, the preliminary conference ofrepresentatives finds a mutually acceptable basis for a meeting of theMinisters, His Majesty&apos;s Government suggest that the Foreign Ministers ofthe United Kingdom, France, the United States and the Union of soviet socialist Republics meet in Washington on a date to be recommended by therepresentatives,   His Majesty&apos;s Government are informed that these arrangements would be convenient to the Governments of France and theUnited States.
