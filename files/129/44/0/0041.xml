(51) 411th February, 1951CABINETNATIONAL INSURANCE SCHEME: INTERIM REPORT BY THEGOVERNMENT ACTUARYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer attach, for the information of my colleagues, a copy of the Interim Report bythe Government Actuary on the working of the National Insurance Scheme duringthe period 5th July, 1948, to 31st March, 1950. This Report is required bySection 39 (1) (b) of the National Insurance Act, 1946. The Report is being published to-day.2.   The Report draws attention to three main points:  (a) there are 23^ million contributors to the scheme, including 21^ millionemployed persons. These figures indicate a considerable shift from the classes of self-employed and non-employed persons to the employedclass since pre-war days;(b) the scheme inherited assets of nearly  900 million from the pre-1948schemes. During the period under review, annual income exceededexpenditure by about  140 million a year. This was mainly due tovery low unemployment, which affected the cost of unemploymentbenefit and resulted in larger contribution receipts. The balances inthe fund are, at present, over  1,100 million.(c) four out of every five persons over age 70 are now receiving eithercontributory or non-contributory pensions. The cost of retirement pensions is at present about  250 million, which represents two-thirds of the total expenditure under the scheme. This figure is expected tobe doubled during the next thirty years because of the increase in theaged population entitled to benefit. As contribution income will remainrelatively stationary, this additional cost will fall almost wholly on theExchequer.3. The Minister of National Insurance and I are at present conducting a reviewof the Insurance Scheme and will circulate proposals to our colleagues in due course.H.

First Interim Report by the Government Actuarylor the period5th July, 1948, to 31st March, 1950To the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&apos;s Treasury&apos;May it please your Lordships:In compliance with the terms of Section 39 (1) (Jb) of the National InsuranceAct, 1946, I have made an interim review of the operation of the Act duringthe period between the appointed day, viz., 5th July, 1948, and 31st March,1950, and I submit the following report.I. introduction. The National Insurance Act provides for seven types of benefit, asfollows:  (i) unemployment benefit;(ii) sickness benefit;(iii) maternity benefits, comprising maternity grant, attendance allowance and maternity allowance;(iv) widows&apos; benefits, comprising widow&apos;s allowance, widowed mother&apos;allowance and widow&apos;s pension ;(v) guardian&apos;s allowance;(vi) retirement pension ;(vii) death grant.Of these, all except maternity grant and death grant are in the form of weekly payments which include, in appropriate cases, additions for dependants.The cost of the benefits and of their administration is met in part by weeklycontributions from employed persons and their employers, from self-employed* persons and from non-employed persons, and in part by payments from theExchequer. The latter comprise (i) supplements under Section 2 (3) (a) ofthe Act to the weekly contributions of insured persons and employers, and(ii) annual grants under Section 2 (3) (b) of prescribed increasing amountfor the period up to 31st March, 1955, and thereafter as may be determinedby Parliament. The revenue from contributions and Exchequer payments is augmented by interest on the invested funds.2. The introduction of the full scheme of National Insurance was preceded by a preliminary stage. As from 30th September, 1946, the rates of con-tributory old age pensions and of pensions to widows over age 60 were raised to the level provided under the new Act, subject to the pensioner^retirement from work if under age 70 (men) or 65 (women), and consequential increases were made in the existing rates of contribution for pensions. Atthe same time the rates of non-contributory &quot; means &quot; pensions were corre-correspondingly increased. On 5th July, 1948, the main provisions of the Actwere brought into force and the existing Unemployment Insurance, national health Insurance, and Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old Age Contributory Pensions311162 a 2NATIONAL INSURANCE ACT. 1946
Acts ceased to operate. The funds accumulated under these Acts were thentransferred to the new National Insurance Fund and National Insurance(Reserve) Fund set up under Sections 35 and 36 of the Act. This report doesnot deal with the operation of the transitional provisions before the appointed day but is limited to&apos; a review of the period starting on that day and to theprogress of the new funds then set up.II. STATISTICS3. The Ministry of National Insurance has published financial accountscovering the whole period from 5th July, 1948, to 31st March, 1950, andhas supplied statistics relating to the numbers insured as at 5th July, 1948,and 31st December, 1949, the numbers of persons in receipt of retirement pensions, widows&apos; benefits and guardians&apos; allowances at various dates up to31st March, 1950, and the claims for maternity and death benefits duringthe calendar year 1949.4. An impossible burden would have been placed on the administrationof the scheme if it had been necessary to tabulate particulars in respect ofevery insured person and every beneficiary under the Act. Instead, theMinistry has, in consultation with officers of this and other Departments,relied on a sampling process to obtain the data required both for this review and for its own purposes. For insured persons a sample of 3 per cent, ofthose on the records was set up and is being maintained on a continuousbasis, whilst for the various categories of beneficiary the size of the samplevaries in accordance with the numbers involved. Thus, a 10 per cent, samplehas been maintained for sickness and maternity benefits, for death grants,widows&apos; benefits and retirement pensions and a 5 per cent, sample&quot; forunemployment benefit. For the small classes of persons in receipt of widow&apos;allowance or guardian&apos;s allowance the whole of the data are being used.The sampling technique has been chosen so as to obtain representative samplesand eliminate bias, but any sample, however representative, is subject tomargins of error dependent on its size and the nature of the statistics ; the size of the sample has in each case been so chosen that any such margins of error will not be large enough to invalidate the conclusions which mightjustifiably be drawn from the data.5. Much of the recording of the data for these samples has had to beundertaken by the Ministry&apos;s local offices at a time when their staffs werenecessarily much occupied with the problems arising in the initial stages of the new scheme, including their primary duties of collecting contributions and paying benefits. Errors occurring particularly during the earlier partof the period have had to be corrected, and as a result certain statisticswere not available for. analysis in this report whilst other statistics cannot yet be regarded as absolutely satisfactory. Now that the initial difficulties inherent in setting up a scheme of this magnitude and complexity havebeen surmounted, and the departmental machinery has been more fully&quot;run in&quot;, it may be expected that&quot;fuller information will be available forthe next report.m. THE INSURED POPULATION6. The sample statistics of insured persons as at 5th July, 1948, showthat, after eliminating duplicate registrations, some 25 million persons were registered at the beginning of the new scheme. It is estimated that, ofthese, over 1 million were married women who had left employment shortly
before that date but were still technically insured under the National HealthInsurance scheme in approved societies, although they had no intention of continuing in employment. Of the remainder about 21^ millions werepersons who were already insured under the schemes of health and pensionsinsurance, including nearly \ million &quot; special voluntary contributors &quot; underthe Voluntary Contributors Act of 1937. The balance of 2\ millions werepersons not in insurance when the scheme started.7. The sample of insured persons on the records at 31st December, 1949,has been analysed by sex and by insurance class i.e., employed contributors,self-employed contributors, non-employed contributors, and a balance corn-prising persons &quot; not-contributing &quot; and the results have been rated up toobtain totals of the insured population in various categories. In this pro-cess, those persons who are excused from payment of contributions owingto sickness, unemployment, etc., are placed in their normal class of employedor self-employed. The &quot; not-contributing&quot; class consists, in the case ofmen, mainly of students or unpaid apprentices and those self-employed and non-employed persons who have claimed and been granted exception because etheir income is less than  104 a year. Single women* in the &quot; not-contributing &quot; class include, in addition to these types of case, certain widowswho have been excepted from insurance. Widows in receipt of the newbenefits under the Act may claim exception but not those receiving widow&apos;sbasic pension (see later, paragraph 29) and those who do so are includedin the &quot; not-contributing &quot; class if they are self-employed or non-employed.If they are employed, however, they are included in the statistics as employedcontributors, because, although they have elected not to contribute, their employers must still pay their share of the contribution.Several categories of married women are included in the &quot; not-contributing &quot;class which, it is estimated, covers well over 7 million married women ofinsurable age, in total. First, there is the large class of housewives who.not being insured persons when the scheme started, were not permitted to insure under the new scheme. These women have not been registered (andconsequently do not fall within the sample of insured persons) unless theysubsequently started to work for an employer or became self-employed andchose to contribute. Secondly, there are those who were married and had left employment before 5th July, 1948, but were still technically insuredwhen the new scheme started (see paragraph 6). They were automaticallyincluded on the register even though they may have had no intention ofcontributing. Thirdly, there are those who married on or after 5th July,* 1948, and have exercised their right not to contribute ; if, however, sucha woman still works for an employer he must continue to pay his shareof the contributions and, whether she pays or not, she is included in the employed class.It has been necessary to go into the above technicalities in some detail in order to show why the numbers registered under the scheme of universalinsurance may be expected to fall short of the total population at the insurableages.8. When, for men, the figures obtained from the sample are rated up andcompared with the estimates of the population of Great Britain at the same date made by the Registrars General of England and Wales and of Scotland,there is a residual shortage in the national insurance numbers of under300,000 out of a total of about 16^ millions, i.e., less than 2 per cent. Several* In this report the term &quot; single women &quot; is used, for convenience, to denote all womenother than married women.
factors may account for this relatively small discrepancy. In the first place,the records from which the sample was taken were not entirely satisfactory.Difficulties were inevitably encountered in setting up a register of insuredpersons the larger part of which was taken from the records of approved societies. These records had to be taken over and kept up to date duringthe difficult change-over period ; but thereafter as contribution cards aresurrendered they are compared with the initial entries, which are thusgradually corrected. Secondly, there has been no full census since 1931and no count of the population since the National Register of 1939. Incompiling their estimates of the current population the Registrars Generalmake use of a variety of other information but, after such a lapse of time since a full count, the results cannot be expected to be absolutely accurateand allowance must be made for a reasonable margin of error. Thirdly,it is possible that a small residue of the population may not have registeredf or insurance either through misunderstanding or, in some cases, deliberate-ately : it is probable that some of the former may have failed to registerbecause they knew that they were entitled to exception from insur-ance. Whilst a steady improvement in the statistics is taking place, the human element will always remain and the statistics will be subject to timelags in registration for insurance, surrender of cards, etc. It is, therefore,doubtful if it will ever be possible to achieve such a degree of accuracyas would enable any small amount of non-compliance to be measured bya comparison between the national insurance statistics and the generalpopulation statistics.9. In the case of women a similar comparison between the insured andthe total population of insurable age has been made separately for single and for married women. Since, as explained in paragraph 7, the numberof married women who have been registered includes a large number ofwomen who were not really insurable under the new scheme, any sub-division of the number of non-contributing married women into those whohave registered but are not required to contribute and those who have notregistered would be valueless. In Table I below, a combined figure has accordingly been given in the &quot; balance &quot; for these two types. This figureconsists mainly of housewives at 5th July, 1948, who were not insurable,but it may contain some cases of non-compliance. These are not, however,likely to be numerous because it is only the married woman working foran employer who is required to register.For single women the comparison reveals the relatively large discrepancyof about 700,000, on a total of some 5^ millions, but in addition to thepossible explanations advanced above in the case of men, which all have at least as much weight for this group, the subdivision by marital statusis not very trustworthy for the insured population. It is probable that inmany cases changes of marital status are not disclosed, whilst there will doubtless be cases of deliberate mis-statement. Moreover, the most recentsubdivision by marital status of the female population of the whole ofGreat Britain relates to mid-1947 and the proportions at this date have been used to subdivide the estimated numbers of women at 31st December, 1949,into single and married. It is thus evident that the statistical basis in thecase of women is not very reliable and it may well be that a not inconsider-able part of the discrepancy is due to one or other of the causes set out above. Indeed, later estimates of the numbers of married women in Englandand Wales, supplied by the Registrar General, indicate a growth in their numbers suggesting the transfer of a further 250,000 from single to married.The shortage of single women would then become about 450,000 instead of
700,000. From the wide margin (between these two figures it is clear that the analysis cannot be precise enough to enable any conclusion to be drawn asto the number of women who have not registered.10. The estimated distribution of the population of insurable age and over(i.e., approximately, at ages above the minimum school-leaving age) at 31st-December, 1949, is given in Table I below.Table I: Classification of population of insurable age and over at 31st December, 1949(Great Britain) (Numbers in thousands)	Men	Married women	Single women	Total	(1)	(2)	(3)	(4)Contributors (a):				Employed (including over age 65 (60))	14,400	2,700	4,200	21,300Self-employed...............	1,200	50	150	1,400Non-employed...............	200	50	250	500Registered but not required to contribute	300	- (b)	300	600Persons above pensionable age not working (in-				cluding self-employed over pensionable age at				the start)..................	1,700	1,700	2,400	5,800Balance [see paragraphs 8 and 9]......	300	7.300(b)	700(c)	8,300Total population of insurable age and over (d)	18,100	11,800	8,000	37,900Notes. (a) The numbers include those in respect of whom only the employees contribution is payable.(b) The balance of 7,300,000 married women has not been subdivided (see paragraph 9);it consists mainly of housewives at 5th July, 1948, who were not insurable.(c) It is possible that the balance may be no more than 450,000 see paragraph 9.(d) Children aged 15 to 18 still at school are not included in the insured population.11. To facilitate broad comparison of the above figures with the original estimate made in 1945, the following statement (Table II) shows the estimatedclassification of the population at the beginning of 1948 by occupationalstatus which was given in the Report on the Financial Provisions of theNational Insurance Bill (Cmd. 6730).Table II: Estimated classification of population of insurable age and over at 1st January, 1948(Great Britain) (Numbers in thousands)		Married	Single		Men	women	women	Total	(1)	(2)	(3)	(4)Insured Persons:				Employed (including over 65 (60))......	13,300	1,400	4,600	19,300Self-employed (including over 65 (60))	2,200	100	500	2,800Non-employed.........      ......	700	8,100	1,200	10,000Persons above pensionable age, not working   ...	1,700	1,700	2,300	5,700Total population of insurable age and over (a)	17,900	11,300	8,600	37,800Note. (a) Children aged 15 to 16 still at school were excluded from the insurable numbers;those aged 16 to 18 at school were treated as students and included in non-employed insured persons.711162 A 3
12. It must be emphasized that the numbers in the two tables are not strictly comparable. In Table I all those who have registered and claimedexception are shown in a separate class, except that all married women,whether registered or not, in respect of whom contributions are not payable&quot;are combined in one group. In Table II, however, those who could clairtiexception were included among the self-employed or the non-employed as appropriate and the large block of housewives not gainfully occupied were,although not insurable, grouped with non-employed insured persons. Self-employed persons over pensionable age at the start of the scheme who hadnot retired from work are included in Table I among the persons abovepensionable age not working, while in Table II they are with self-employedinsured persons.Even allowing for these differences, however, it is clear that the numberof persons working for an employer is considerably larger than was assumed in the estimates for the Bill,, and, conversely, that the number of self-employed persons is very much less. The increase is most marked in the case of married women, partly, of course, because there has been a general increasein the proportion of women who are married. In 1945, when the Reporton the Bill was drawn up, the most recent information available as tooccupational status was the 1931 Census and, although some adjustmentswere made to allow for trends such as the more extensive employment ofwomen between the census and the outbreak of war, no account was taken of war-time changes nor was it thought possible to forecast the post-war position. The difference between the two tables may thus be said to indicatebroadly the effect of the war and of post-war economic conditions on the occupational status of the population.IV. THE NATIONAL INSURANCE FUNDS13. The Accounts of the National Insurance Funds for the period from5th July, 1948, to 31st March, 1949, were published as H.C. Paper 61 of1950 and those for the financial year ended 31st March, 1950, have just been published as H.C. Paper 28 of 1950-51.14. The new scheme inherited assets of about  900 millions from the funds of the old schemes, made up as follows:    millionsUnemployment Insurance   ...      ...      ...... 546National Health Insurance............ 233Contributory Pensions       ............ 120Total..................        899 millionsIt is worthy of note that the Unemployment Funds contributed nearly 550 millions to the starting balance, this large sum having been accumulatedas a result of the very light unemployment experienced both during and since the war. Owing mainly to the continuance of low unemploymentafter the war, the starting funds amounted to about  100 millions more than was assumed by the Government Actuary in his Report on the national insurance Bill, 1946 (Cmd. 6730) which was prepared at a time when thedate of commencement of the new scheme had not been fixed and whenit was thought that there might be a substantial amount of unemploymentin the early post-war period.15. Under the Act two funds are set up : the National Insurance (Reserve)&apos; Fund, the purpose of which is clear from its title, and the National insurance fund, which constitutes a current account into which flows the income from
-    198contributions. Exchequer grants and interest from both funds, and out ofwhich the cost of benefits and administration is met. On the appointed day.the investments of the old funds, which had cost about  898 millions, were transferred to the National Insurance (Reserve) Fund at their then market value of about  885 millions; with  1 million of sundry capital assetsthere was thus a starting balance of about  886 millions. As provided in theAct, a sum of  100 millions was forthwith transferred from the reserve fund to the National Insurance Fund and this sum, together with sundryassets of a revenue nature, less sundry liabilities, gave the latter fund a startingbalance of  100.5 millions.16. The Accounts for 1948-49 and 1949-50 show certain items of income and outgo (including some payments under the National Health insurance acts) relating to the period before the appointed day, and if the openingbalances are adjusted for the transfer between the two funds and for these items they become  786.4 millions in the Reserve Fund and  109.6 millions in the National Insurance Fund. These figures form the starting balancesshown in the summary of the transactions of the Funds during the first 21months which has been prepared from the Accounts and is given in theAppendix hereto. The opening balances have thus been adjusted as faras possible in respect of items relating to periods before the appointed day ;they will be subject to further adjustment in respect of certain late transactions,but, apart from sums of about  3.6 millions due to the Northern IrelandFunds and  600,000 due to the Manx Funds under reciprocal financial arrangements, these will mostly be of a minor character.17. It will be seen from the Appendix that as at 31st March, 1950, thebalance in the National Insurance (Reserve) Fund stood at its commencingfigure of  786.4 millions whilst the balance in the National Insurance Fundamounted to  333.7 millions, showing an increase of  224.1 millions on the initial balance of  109.6 millions. The financial arrangements of the new scheme were framed with the intention that the balance in the Fund wouldbe maintained at a fairly steady level of about  100 millions up to 1955 subject to fluctuations and the amounts of the payments from the Exchequerduring that period under Section 2 (3) (b) of the Act were fixed accordingly.The growth of some  224 millions in the funds during the first 21 months ofthe scheme, corresponding to an average increase of  128 millions a year,is due mainly to &quot; full employment&quot;. Whereas the financial basis islinked to an average rate of unemployment of 8J per cent. a rate thought,,in 1945, to be no more than a prudent assumption for the purpose of financingan insurance scheme, having in view post-war uncertainties the actual aver-age for the relevant 21 months was little more than \\ per cent. This verylight unemployment was responsible for a direct saving of  138 millions on-&quot;unemployment benefit and for extra receipts of contributions amounting to 45 millions. More than four-fifths of the growth in funds is thus accountedfor, and the balance of some  41 millions is attributable to a variety ofcauses. Of these the most important were a favourable experience in respectof sickness benefit and the interest earned on the larger funds.18. The statistics available do not permit of a close examination being madeof the working of the scheme during the period under review, nor would theresults of such an analysis be very reliable in view of the adjustments made,and the other special features occurring, in the early months of the scheme.A reasonably satisfactory comparison can be made, however, of the main items of actual receipts and expenditure for the year ended 31st March, 1950,with the corresponding amounts estimated in the original calculations for theBill; and there is no reason to suppose that conclusions drawn from the911162 A 4
experience of this year would be falsified if the whole 21 months could be similarly considered.   The results of this comparison of &quot; actual&quot; with .&quot; expected &quot; are given in the following Table III.Table III:  Comparison of expected and actual income and outgo in the yearended 31st March, 1950(  millions)	Expected	Actual	Excess of Income	(1)	(2)	(3)Income:			Contributions of insured persons and			employers*    ...      ......	316	- 360	Exchequer supplements to contributions	82	96	14/58Exchequer grantsf      .........	40	40	 Interest income.........	21	28$	7Total income   .........	459	524	65	Expected	Actual	Saving on OutgoOutgo:			Unemployment benefit!       ......	94	14	80Sickness benefit ...	77	66	11Maternity benefits      .........	9	9	 .Widows&apos; benefits and guardian&apos;s allow-			ance   ......      .........	23	22	1Retirement pension     ......	241	249	- 8Death grant     ............	2	2	 Administration............	18	23S	- 5iosses on realisation of securities   ...	 	2	- 2Total outgo     ......	464	387	77* Excluding contributions towards National Health Service; these receipts, amountingto  40 millions for 1949-50, are transferred forthwith to the Health Departments.f Excluding extended unemployment benefit (and related Exchequer repayments) underSection 62 of the Act.J Adjusted from 28 - 6 in order to balance.j Provisional figure, subject to adjustment.19. It will be seen that, on the income side, the contribution receipts,together with the Exchequer supplements, were about  58 millions morethan expected. There are two main reasons for this. In the first place, in comparison with the pre-war position a larger proportion of the populationat the contributing ages is in the employed class, for which the rates of con-tribution owing to the more extensive benefits insured are higher than forthe other two classes. Secondly, both unemployment and (to a much smallerextent) sickness have been lighter than was assumed, with the result that more contributions per annum have been paid than were allowed for. Of thetotal of  58 millions, about  30 millions can be ascribed to the second cause.The excess of interest income is due mainly to the starting funds being larger than the assumed amount.As regards the outgo, the main divergence has been in respect of unem-ployment benefit, the cost of which during this period of virtually full employment was only about 15 per cent, of the &quot; expected &quot;, accounting for about  80 millions saving in expenditure. As already mentioned, anaverage level of 8-1 per cent, unemployment was assumed in the financialestimates for the Bill, on instructions from the Government of the day. Inthe light of the experience of the last five years it may now be thought that
the assumption then made was over-cautious ; but, however that may be, itis necessary in framing the finances of a scheme of insurance against unem-ployment to allow for a rate that may reasonably be expected on the average over an employment cycle and this will clearly be markedly higher than thelevel during favourable employment conditions.The expenditure on sickness benefit has been some 15 per cent, lighterthan expected, but not all of the difference is real saving ; if allowance ismade for certain payments of sickness benefit which are not brought to account in the normal manner, the favourable margin is reduced to about12^ per cent. The experience under the new scheme, with higher benefits,cannot yet be regarded as mature, so that it is not possible at present to saydefinitely whether sickness claims are likely to remain at a level somewhatbelow that adopted for the finances of the scheme.20. One other feature is worthy of special comment. This is the pre-ponderating part which the cost of retirement pensions is seen to play inthe finances of the scheme. Even in the original estimates, for which expenditure on unemployment benefit was based on a rate of unemploy-ment of 8^ per cent., the expenditure on retirement pensions was about one-half of the total expenditure. Now, when the actual payments for un-employment benefit are on a much lower level, retirement pensions alreadyaccount for nearly two-thirds of the total outgo on benefits and administra-tion. Moreover, whilst the cost of the other benefits (with the exception ofthe relatively small charge for widows&apos; pensions) may be expected to remainmore or less stationary in future years, the cost of retirement pensions islikely to be doubled in the next thirty years, mainly as a result of the increasein the aged population entitled to benefit. On the other hand, the annual contribution income from insured persons and employers will probably beno greater in thirty years&apos; time than it is now, even if full employment ismaintained and after allowance is made for the additional 4d. a week per head payable from October next. This addition to the rates of contributionwas prescribed for the specific purpose of assisting to meet the rising burdenof pensions expenditure, but its yield will be small ( 17 millions a year)in relation to the sums involved and it is evident that substantially the wholeof the large increases in cost will fall on the Exchequer i.e., will be charged to general taxation.V. UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFIT2if In this and succeeding sections reference is made to a number offeatures of financial or statistical interest in regard to the individual benefits which are thought to warrant comment in viewing the operations of the new scheme. In the case of unemployment benefit a substantial number of personsin the employed class who had been excepted from the Unemployment Insur-ance scheme were insured for the first time in July, 1948, and became eligiblefor benefit in January, 1949. It is not possible to measure the resultingincrease in the number of new claimants since the available statistics do notseparate this from the normal seasonal increase at about the same time but,almost certainly, it cannot be large, since most of the newly-included groupsexperience little, if any, unemployment at any time. Further, owing to theinclusion of these groups, rates of unemployment for the National Insurancepopulation are not directly comparable with similar rates for the formerUnemployment Insurance population.22. The rate of unemployment over the period from 5th July, 1948, to31st March, 1950, was consistently under 2 per cent.   The over-all percentage,
as measured by the numbers of persons registering for work at EmploymentExchanges (published monthly in the Ministry of Labour Gazette), has shownonly small variations over the period and these are mainly seasonal, the rangebeing from about 1.3 per cent, in the summer months to about 1.8 per cent,in the winter.Persons who register at Employment Exchanges include, however, not only those in receipt of normal (standard) unemployment benefit under the Act, butalso (i) those who have exhausted their title to normal benefit and are inreceipt of &quot; extended benefit&quot;; the cost of which is met wholly from theExchequer and (ii) those who are in receipt of national assistance, as well as(iii) a variety of persons who have registered for employment but have notclaimed benefit because, for one reason or another, they have no title.23. The available statistics do. not give all the information desirable for thepurpose of analysing the finances of unemployment benefit. Some indicationregarding the proportion of the unemployed who obtain benefit may, however,be obtained from a monthly count made by the Ministry of Labour of thenumbers on the registers who are &quot; rated &quot; for normal benefit, for extendedbenefit and for national assistance respectively. This shows that, on average over the year 1949-50, only about 60 per cent, were &quot; rated&quot; for normalbenefit and that about 17 per cent, and 10 per cent, respectively were &quot; rated &quot;for extended benefit and national assistance. Allowing for the fact that thenumber of claims &quot; rated &quot; for benefit includes persons serving &quot; waiting days &quot;but does not include persons whose benefit position is still under considera-tion on the day of the count, it is probable that the figure of 60 per cent,quoted above somewhat understates the position and that on average about two-thirds of the registered unemployed are actually drawing the normalbenefit. It appears also that, making allowance for the various types of caseincluded among those receiving assistance, about one-fifth of the registeredunemployed i.e., more than one-half of those not receiving normal benefit have exhausted their title thereto as the result of unemployment lasting for at least 30 weeks, either continuously or interrupted by breaks each less than13 weeks.The continuance for the past ten years or more of a state of full employment has not in fact led to the complete disappearance of long-term unemployment;there persists in the ranks of the registered unemployed, as the above figuresillustrate, a relatively substantial group of chronically unemployed ormarginally employable persons. In present circumstances the other groups of persons responsible for the low proportion of unemployed who are inreceipt of normal benefit probably consist, in the main, of very short-termunemployed many of whom have voluntarily given up one job in order tofind another who are either serving their &quot; waiting days &quot; for benefit or have incurred disqualification.VI. SICKNESS BENEFIT24. The new scheme of sickness benefit differs considerably from the oldNational Health Insurance scheme. In the first place, broadly speaking,every person who is employed or self-employed is now insured for sickness benefit, the main exceptions being married women, certain widow beneficiariesand self-employed persons with low income all entitled to exercise an optionwhether or not to be insured. Secondly, the rates of benefit under the scheme are considerably higher than under the old scheme. Thirdly, whereas benefit under the old scheme was divided into two parts, viz., sickness benefit fora period not exceeding 26 weeks and disablement benefit at a lower rate
payable after the first 26 weeks of &quot; continuous &quot; sickness, under the new scheme the same rate of benefit is payable no matter how long the illnessmay last. Moreover, the basic rates of benefit are now supplemented byallowances for adult and child dependants. The effect on the benefit paymentis considerable ; to take a common case, a married man with one or more children will draw 49s. 6d. a week throughout his illness, however long it maylast, compared with something between 18s. and 23s. a week for the first six months of illness, reduced to between 10s. 6d. and 13s. thereafter. Theexperience in respect of sickness benefit has to be viewed in the light of these considerations.25. As will be seen from Table III, the expected cost of sickness benefit for the year ended 31st March, 1950, as used in the financial estimates for.the National Insurance Bill, was  77 millions whilst the actual cost was&quot; 66 millions. It must not be assumed from this that the average sicknessper person was about six-sevenths of the expectation. The point cannot bedecided until the statistics necessary in order to analyse the difference betweenthe expected and actual cost of sickness benefit become available from the10 per cent, sample which is being recorded by the Ministry of national insurance (see paragraph 4 above). It is probable that, in addition to rates ofclaim somewhat lower than were assumed, other main causes are differences inthe numbers insured for sickness benefit and in the proportions of these withdependants, and the exclusion of certain claims from the accounts.26. As stated above, the rates of sickness benefit paid under the Act are considerably greater than those previously in force under the National HealthInsurance scheme. In fixing the rates of sickness to be assumed in the calcula-tion of the contributions, and for the financial estimates for the Bill, theGovernment Actuary took into consideration the fact that general experienceof sickness insurance had shown that an increase in the rate of sickness benefitusually led to an increase in claim rates. It may be that any increase ofthis nature will not reach its full effect in the first year or two following the increase in the rates of benefit. In any case the experience of one year,even if the full statistics were available and even if there were no disturbingelements such as the increase in benefit rates, would be inadequate to providea true indication of the average level of sickness.VII. MATERNITY BENEFITS27. The maternity benefits under the National Insurance scheme are much larger and more varied than those under National Health Insurance, thescheme having been extended to meet the differing needs of housewives andof mothers who follow a gainful employment. The lump sum &quot; maternitygrant&quot; of  4 per birth, payable for practically all confinements, is accom-panied either by an &quot; attendance allowance &quot; of 20s. a week per confinementfor the four weeks following confinement (subject to easy contribution con-ditions on either the husband&apos;s or the wife&apos;s insurance) or by a &quot; maternityallowance &quot; of 36s. a week for a period normally of thirteen weeks commencing -ing with the sixth week before the expected confinement (subject to a more severe contribution test designed to limit the recipients to&apos;employed or self-employed women).28. The cost of maternity benefit in 1949-50 amounted to  8.5 millions as compared with an expected cost of  8.7 millions on the basis of theGovernment Actuary&apos;s Report on the Bill. These costs are the resultsof the combination of a large number of complex factors such as the propor-tion of women who are married, the fertility rates for women and the differencebetween these rates for women who are employed and for those who are
at home, the proportions of claimants qualifying for each type qf benefit,and so on. The apparently close agreement between the expected cost and theactual out-turn conceals a number of divergences in these factors which, inthe aggregate, have practically cancelled each other out.Full information is not yet available on this matter but certain generalfeatures affecting the expenditure are evident. First, as compared withthe pre-war position, the proportion of women who are married has risen,and the proportion of married women in paid employment is much greater.Secondly, it is probable that fertility rates for 1949-50 were slightly above those for 1938, on which the expectation was based. Thirdly, the proportionof births in respect of which claims were made was somewhat lower than had been assumed ; this may be due to a number of causes and it is possiblethat the claim rate may rise as the value of the benefits becomes more widelyappreciated. Fourthly, the proportion of confinements for which maternityallowance rather than attendance allowance was paid, was considerably lower than had been allowed for, this being due probably to the effectiveness of themore stringent contribution conditions in limiting qualification for the largerbenefit.VIII.. WIDOWS&apos; BENEFITS29. Under the old Contributory Pensions scheme the widow&apos;s benefit con-sisted of a pension of 10s. a week (with additions of 5s. for the first and3s. for each other dependent child). The 10s. benefit is still payable under thenew Act in certain circumstances and it is then called a &quot; widow&apos;s basicpension &quot;. The widows&apos; benefits granted from 5th July, 1948, differ fromthis uniform benefit in that they are designed to meet the differing needsof the widow according to age and family responsibilities. Thus, on widow-hood she receives a relatively large &quot; widow&apos;s allowance &quot; for a temporaryperiod 36s. a week for thirteen weeks, with an extra 7s. 6d. if she has a child to cover the period of readjustment immediately following the husbxnd&apos;sdeath. This is followed by a &quot; widow&apos;s pension &quot; at the rate of 26s. a week(the normal rate for the other weekly benefits under the Act) if, having no dependent child, she was over age 50 at widowhood and had been marriedat least ten years ; otherwise a temporary &quot; widowed mother&apos;s allowance &quot;of 33s. 6d. (which includes 7s. 6d. for the child) is payable if and for so longas she has a child of school age, or a temporary widow&apos;s pension of 26s. is paid if she is incapable of work owing to illness. The able-bodied childlesswidow under 50 receives no further benefit because she is expected to be ableto earn her own living after the preliminary period. Easier conditions apply,however, to those who have qualified for either of the two temporary benefits ;the &quot; widowed mother &quot;, when she no longer has a child of school age, is granted a widow&apos;s pension if she is then over 40 and had been married notless than ten years earlier; the &quot; widow&apos;s pension &quot; payable to the incapaci-tated widow who recovers is continued if she is then over 50 and had beenmarried not less than ten years.30. All widows who were receiving benefits under the old scheme were either transferred at the start to one or other of the new classes of beneficiaryor continued to receive their old 10s. pensions. There was thus nosudden change in the number of widow beneficiaries at 5th July, 1948, though there was an immediate and large increase in the cost of their benefits. Asubstantial number of men became insured for the first time on the appointed day, but there will be no addition to the number of widow beneficiaries on&quot;this account until after July, 1951, because widows&apos; benefits are payableonly if 156 actual contributions have been paid.
D3\. Benefits in payment. The following Table IV shows the total numberof widows in the various benefit categories at 31st March, 1949, and 31stMarch, 1950, with, for comparison, the total number of widow pensionersat 30th June, 1948, i.e., jiist before the new scheme started. The table alsogives the numbers in payment at reduced rates owing to the husband&apos;s lowcontribution average or to receipt of a dependants war pension but abate-ments of pension on account of earnings or periods in hospital are not includedhere.Table IV: Number of widows&apos; benefits, in payment (Great Britain)Type of benefit	Weekly rate of benefit	Under the Contributory Pensions Acts at 30th June, 1948	Under the Natioi		ml Insurance Act				At 31st March, &apos;   1949		At 31st March, 1950				Total	At reduced rates	Total	At reduced ratesWidow&apos;s allowance: With child.........

But the figures for widows&apos; allowances and widowed mothers&apos; allowances include a few overage 60, because these benefits are continued as such after that age so longas title persists.32. Some points of interest in these figures may be noted. The numberof widows&apos; allowances constitutes only 4 per cent, of the total number of widows&apos; benefits at present in payment. It is a very short-term benefit,lasting only for thirteen weeks, and hence payments rose to their full levelbefore the end of 1948 and should vary only with the number of newwidowhoods.Widowed mothers&apos; allowances, which may be described as long-termtemporary benefits (lasting so long as there is a dependent child), comprisenearly one-quarter of the total. This category also started with a full quota ofbeneficiaries, and the fact that the number has increased during the year1949-50 by about 7 per cent, must be attributed partly to the increase inthe number of married men and partly to the greater proportion of newwidows who have children, as a result of the higher birth rates of recentyears.The composition of the widows&apos; pension group calls for explanation. AtJuly, 1948, a widow pensioner between the ages of 50 and 60 was notawarded the new widow&apos;s pension unless she was then incapacitated ; thosewho had a dependent child were given widowed mothers&apos; allowances and theremainder continued to draw the widow&apos;s basic pension of 10s.  Thus, at
the start, the widows&apos; pension group consisted only of incapacitated widows.Thereafter, widows&apos; pensions were awarded to women becoming widows atages over 50 and to widowed mothers over age 40 whose allowances ceased,in both cases without any question of incapacity, and to other widows underage 50 whose allowances ceased, if they were then incapable of work. Thenumbers in receipt of widows&apos; pensions rose rapidly to March, 1950, andwill continue to do so for a period of ten years and more until a full com-complement of beneficiaries in this group has been reached.The residual group of widows&apos; basic pensions, although declining in numbers, is not altogether a closed class, for, in addition to the pensionscontinued from July, 1948, to widows who were not awarded new typewidows&apos; benefits, further awards of 10s. pensions will continue to be made so long as men who were married and insured before July, 1948, die leavingwidows under age 50 without children or widows who cease to have anydependent children by the time they attain age 40. At present about 16 percent, of widows who receive the temporary widow&apos;s allowance are thereaftergranted a 10s. pension and only about 1 per cent, cease to draw benefit ofany kind. As the proportion of widows under age 60 entitled to the 10s.pension gradually declines over the next 30 years or so, the proportion whowill cease to be entitled to any further benefit at the end of the first thirteenweeks of widowhood may be expected to increase from 1 per cent, to, say,one-sixth.33. Reduction of benefits. Widows&apos; benefits are subject to reduction belowthe standard rates for two principal reasons. If the &quot; yearly average&quot; ofcontributions paid by the deceased husband (or excused on grounds of incapacity, unemployment, etc.) is less than 50 the rate of widow&apos;s benefit is reduced throughout its currency on a scale varying with the contributionaverage. Secondly, during the currency of a widowed mother&apos;s allowanceor a widow&apos;s pension (but not the initial widow&apos;s allowance) a widow whoundertakes any form of gainful occupation has her benefit reduced by Is. foreach Is. of net earnings after the first 30s. in any week. This rule is subject tothe proviso that, in the case of a widow whose late husband was insured underthe old Contributory Pensions scheme, her benefit is not to be reduced below10s. a week (or 15s. if she has a child). In addition, reductions may bemade in some cases on account of receipt of dependants war pension, orwhilst the widow is in hospital.34. The numbers in payment at reduced rates of benefit given in Table IVcomprise all causes of reduction other than earnings or a stay in hospital.They amount to only 1 per cent, of the total numbers in payment at March,1950, excluding the 10s. group ; a further analysis shows that about one-thirdof them were cases where the reduction was on account of some specialfeature, e.g., a dependants war pension, whilst the remaining two-thirds werecases in which the insured person had a deficient contribution average at thedate of his death. Of the latter class about three-quarters suffered a reductionof only Is. or 2s. a week, i.e., the contribution average was 46 or upwardsper year.The figures in the table are not, however, a true indication of the per-manent position, for two main reasons. In the first place, for persons whowere insured when the new scheme came into force the period over whichcontributions are to be averaged goes back only to 1936, or to date of entryif later, and such persons were generally credited with 52 contributions ayear up to July, 1947. For this reason insured persons dying in the first fewyears of the scheme are hound, in most cases, to have a very good contributionaverage, whatever their actual contribution record since 1947.   Gradually,
the contributions actually paid will have more influence in the average but,as 50 contributions a year (whether paid or excused) qualify for full benefits,there is no reason to suppose that the requirements of the contribution averagewill be a serious factor in reducing benefits. The second, and probably moreimportant, temporary factor is that the bulk of the widowed mothers&apos; allow-ances and a substantial part of the widows&apos; pensions in force relate to women who were already widows when the new scheme started and had satisfied theold contribution test under which either a full pension or, exceptionally, noneat all was granted.35. The abatements to widows&apos; benefits on account of earnings are of moresubstance. No regular returns are maintained of the reductions in benefitpayments because the beneficiary&apos;s earnings exceed the prescribed amountor because she is in hospital but, in order to obtain some information onthe subject, an investigation was made by sample into the amounts of the reductions during the six months September, 1949, to February, 1950. this inquiry showed that during the six months the amount by which widowed mothers&apos; allowances were reduced for this reason was about  525,000, repre-senting nearly 12 per cent, of the total expenditure on the benefit in the period.For widows&apos; pensions the corresponding reduction was about  170,000, or about 13 per cent, of the total cost excluding pensions granted to widowsbecause they were incapable of work. Under the two heads the annualreduction amounts to nearly  1^ millions, with a corresponding abatementto the cost of the scheme. As regards numbers, each week there were, on average, about 32,000 widows whose pensions were reduced or suspendedon account of earnings. This represents one-fifth of the average numbers inreceipt of widowed mothers&apos; allowances and widows&apos; pensions (other thanincapacitated widows). This is a significant proportion which clearly showsthat a considerable number of these widows under age 60 are able to earnappreciable sums in paid employment.The reductions in widows&apos; benefits on account of temporary spells in hospital were negligible.36. Types of award. The preceding paragraphs in this section relate tonumbers of allowances and pensions in payment. Detailed statistics of awardsare not yet available for Great Britain as a whole, but preliminary figures for england alone show the way in which those widows who were awardedtemporary widows&apos; allowances during 1949 fared at the end of their 13 weeks.Roughly speaking, one-fifth of these widows were over 60 and consequentlywere awarded retirement pensions immediately; one-quarter were awardedwidowed mothers&apos; allowances because they had dependent children; one-third received widows&apos; pensions and about 2 per cent, widows&apos; pensions on grounds of incapacity ; one-sixth were not entitled to a new type pension but were awarded a 10s. pension because they were married before the appointed day; and only 1 per cent, received no further pension. These figures are not directly comparable with statistics of the various benefits in payment (see table IV) because the latter are affected by the differing durations of thevarious types of benefit and, moreover, exclude widows over age 60 in receiptof retirement pensions.IX. GUARDIAN&apos;S ALLOWANCE37. The guardian&apos;s allowance replaces the orphan&apos;s pension under the contributory Pensions scheme, but the conditions for payment of the newbenefit are somewhat different. Payment of the new benefit being limitedto the guardians of orphans who are included in families, institutions do not
receive guardians&apos; allowances in respect of the orphans in their care; theymay continue, however, to receive orphans&apos; pensions awarded under the contributory Pensions Acts. In addition, there are a number of cases&apos; inwhich children&apos;s allowances under those Acts are continued as a transitionalmeasure.The numbers of allowances and pensions in payment as at 30th June,1948, 31st March, 1949, and 31st March, 1950, were as follows :-Table V: Number of guardians&apos; allowances, orphans&apos; pensions and children&apos;s allowances in payment (Great Britain)Type of benefit	Weekly rate of benefit	Under the Contributory Pensions Acts at 30th June, 1948	Under the Insurar	National ice Act			At 31st March, 1949	At 31st March, 1950Guardian&apos;s allowance     .........

The transitional classes of orphans&apos; pensions and children&apos;s allow-ances should decline steadily whilst the guardians&apos; allowances should remainapproximately at the same level.X. RETIREMENT PENSION38. The introduction of the National Insurance scheme in July, 1948, didnot result immediately in. any great change in the numbers of age pensions in payment, since persons who had been pensioned under the superseded Con-tributory Pensions and Special Voluntary Contributors&apos; schemes had their pensions automatically continued, whilst no pensions can arise for ten years in respect of persons becoming insured for the first time under the new scheme. Nor did it affect substantially the rates of benefit being paid, for the pension under the old schemes had been increased in October, 1946, from theexisting level of 10s. a week (20s. for a married couple) to the new schemelevel of 26s. (42s. for a married couple). These higher rates were payablegenerally to existing pensioners, subject to their retirement from work orattainment of age 70 (65 for women).39. A number of important changes, most of which are of cumulativefinancial significance, were introduced as from 5th July, 1948, and affect allpersons who reach the minimum pensionable age of 65 (men) or 60 (women)on or after that date. The main new features are :(i) Retirement conditions. An insured person who continues at workon reaching pensionable age does not qualify for pension until he or she retires from work or reaches age 70 (man) or 65 (woman).
Moreover, pensions once granted may be subject to reductionduring periods of paid work after retirement but before age 70(65 for women).(ii) Increments of pension.   If retirement from work is deferred beyondage 65 (60 for women) the standard pension is augmented by anincrement of Is. a week for life for every 25 contributions paidafter pension age. In the case of a married man there is a furtherIs. a week for each 25 contributions paid by him if both he andhis wife are over pensionable age. These increments are subjectto a maximum of 10s. for a single person and 20s. for a married couple.(iii) Dependants allowance.   Dependants allowance is payable to a pen-sioner who has retired or attained age 70 at the rate of 16s. aweek for a wife under age 60 and 7s. 6d. a week for the firstdependent child. This is paid whether the pensioner attained 65before or after 5th July, 1948.40. Number of pensions in payment. The following table shows the num-bers of retirement pensions in payment at 31st March, 1949, and 31st March,1950, compared with the numbers of age pensions under the old scheme at30th June, 1948. The numbers are subdivided by type of pensioner and,in addition to the total numbers in payment, the numbers at reduced ratesand at the transitional rate of 10s. are given. Pensions at reduced ratesexclude those temporarily abated on account of earnings, periods in hospital,etc.: the question of reductions is dealt with later, in paragraphs 42 to 45.Table VI: Number of retirement (or age) pensions in payment (Great Britain)(Numbers in thousands)Type of pensioner	Under the Contri-butory Pensions Acts at 30th June, 1948	Under the National Insurance Act							At 31	st March, 1949		At 31st March, 1950				Total	At reduced rates	At transi-tional rate of 10s. a week	Total	At reduced rates	At transi-tional rate of 10s. a weekMen       ......

It will be seen that the numbers of pensions in payment at 31st March,1949, were somewhat less than the final numbers under the old scheme.The reason for this is the introduction of the retirement condition. Underthe old scheme pensions were normally payable from age 65 (60 for women)
whether or not the insured was still working, whereas under the new schemepensions do not become payable until retirement takes place. The reductionin the number of new pensioners on this account more than counterbalancedthe increase in the number of persons of pensionable ages.42. Reduction of pension. Retirement pensions are subject to reductionbelow the standard rate for the following main reasons:  (i) Contribution average,   iff the &quot; yearly average &quot; of contributions paidby the insured person (or excused on grounds of incapacity, un-employment, etc.) is less than 50, a reduced pension is awardedon a scale varying with the contribution average ; this reduced rateapplies throughout the currency of the pension.(ii) Earnings.   A pensioner who undertakes any form of gainful oecupa-tion between the ages of 65 and 70 (between 60 and 65 for a woman) has his benefit reduced by Is. a week for each Is. of earnings after the first 20s. In the case of pensioners who reachedpensionable age prior to 5th July, 1948, the rate of pension is notreduced below 10s. a week.(iii) Modified pensions.   Certain classes of persons who started to pay contributions under the old Contributory Pensions Acts at agesover 45 became entitled under those Acts to pensions at less thanthe standard rate of 10s. a week. When this rate-was raised inOctober, 1946, to 26s. (16s. for wives) the modified pensions were increased proportionately and thus continue to be paid at less thanthe new standard rates.(iv) Dependants&apos; war pensions and hospital cases.   Reductions may bemade in some cases on account of receipt of dependants warpension, or whilst the pensioner is in hospital.As is evident from the figures in Table VI, the proportion of pensions nowpayable at permanently reduced rates is not large, being of the order of60,000 or about \\ per cent, of the total pensions in payment. This figuremeans very litde, however, in view of the different conditions governing theaward of new and old pensions and the changing mixture of types of pensionin the pensioner population. Such statistics as are available are examined in more detail in the succeeding paragraphs.43. Defective contribution average. The figures in columns (3) and (6)of Table VI give the numbers in payment at reduced rates of benefit otherthan those reduced on account of earnings or temporary spells in hospital.Further analysis shows that nearly one-half of these cases are attributable to the modifications of pension described in (iii) in the preceding paragraph,whilst most of the remaining reductions are due to the receipt of dependantswar pension. The cases of reduction of pension on account of a deficientcontribution average amounted to only one-eighth of 1 per cent, at March,1949, and one-fifth of 1 per cent, at March, 1950. At March, 1949, about two-thirds of these cases had a reduction of 3s. a week or less, i.e., the contribution average was 43 or upwards a year; corresponding figures for march, 1950, are not available.As in the case of widows, however, the current proportions reduced onaccount of a low contribution average do not give a true indication of theultimate position, partly because of the contribution credits from 1936 referredto in paragraph 34, but mainly because the great bulk of the pensionerson the books were awarded their pensions before the new scheme started and were therefore not subject to this test.
44. Reductions of pension on account of earnings, etc. The sample enquirymentioned in paragraph 35 showed that the amount by which pensions were reduced on account of earnings after retirement in the six months September,1949, to February, 1950, was some  650,000, whilst the deductions frompension because the pensioner was in hospital amounted to a little over 300,000. Taken together, therefore, these two provisions for the abate-ment of pensions may be said to reduce pensions expenditure by practically 2 millions a year. The numbers of retirement pensioners who had their pensions reduced on account of earnings averaged about 21,000 men and11,000 women each week. These reductions apply only to those retirement pensioners who are not more than five years over the minimum pensionable age, of whom the average numbers during the six months in question were about 400,000 men and 470,000 women. The proportions with reducedpensions on account of earnings were thus about 5 per cent, for men and2 per cent, for women.About one-half per cent, of age and retirement pensioners were subject to reductions of pension whilst in hospital. The proportion is low because such reductions are made only when the patient has been in hospital for at leasteight weeks.45. Modification of pensions. The numbers of pensions modified onaccount of late entry into the field of insurance under the old contributory pensions Acts amounted to about two-thirds per cent, of all pensions in payment. This is a transitional class of pensioner, the numbers of whomwill decline steadily though individuals will continue to draw modified pensions for many years to come.46. Dependants of pensioners. If the wife of a retirement pensioner is overage 60, she is granted a separate pension of 16s. a week by virtue of hisinsurance, but if she is under age 60 she is treated as a dependant (untilshe attains age 60) and a pension of 42s. a week is payable to the husbandin respect of both if the conditions as to dependency are satisfied. At31st March, 1950, there were 65,800 such joint pensions payable. this number is no more than one-half of the number of wives under age 60 of retirement pensioners, estimated on recent statistics of proportions marriedbut on 1931 Census particulars which are the latest available of relativeages of husbands and wives. Although allowances are not payable if the wife is gainfully occupied it seems unlikely that so high a proportion as one-half of the wives of these retired pensioners are themselves at work ;it is also unlikely that population changes since 1931 can account for thesmaller proportion. The explanation may be, in part, that some pensionersdo not realise the benefits available in respect of a dependent wife ; but some part of the shortage is likely to be due to legally married couples whoare not living together and couples living together as man and wife who arenot legally married.At 31st March, 1950, about three-quarters per cent., or nearly 12,000, of the male retirement pensioners were receiving allowances for dependent children.The proportion of women retirement pensioners in receipt of such allowanceswas negligible.47. Increments of pension. Some statistics are available of the incrementsnow being paid as a result of deferment of retirement; they are considered in these paragraphs in view of their general interest although the scheme has been running for too short a time for its effect to be assessed. By31st March, 1950, of the 4,161,000 pensioners about 18,000, or a little under one-half per cent., were drawing increments.   Of these about 11,800 were
receiving one increment (Is. a week), 5,600 two increments and 600 threeincrements. In these statistics husband and wife are counted separately.About one-half of the total receiving increments were men, nearly one-fifthWere women pensioners in their own right and nearly one-third were wives of pensioners or widows of insured men. The proportion of pensioners withincrements will grow for many years as the number of pensioners who havereached pensionable age after the appointed day increases.Some further light on this matter may be obtained from the figures relatingto new awards. Of the 262,000 retirement pensions awarded during theyear 1949-50, just over 6 per cent, received increments for deferment of retirement after pensionable age. The proportion varies considerably for thedifferent categories of pensioner. Thus, in the case of men, about 9\ percent, of the awards received increments, and nearly 7 per cent, of wiveshad their pensions increased ; but only about 3  per cent, of women receiving pension on their own insurance stayed at work long enough after age60 to earn one or more increments, and as the majority of awards of retire-ment pensions to widows are the continuation of pensions drawn beforeage 60, the proportion of these qualifying for increments was only \\ per cent.48. The working o  the retirement condition. The retirement condition,coupled with increments to pension, was introduced with the object of encouraging employed and self-employed persons to remain at work beyondthe minimum pensionable age. Less than two years have elapsed betweenthe full introduction of this innovation, on 5th July, 1948, and the latestdate for which any statistics are available, viz., 31st March, 1950. This isa very short time in which to observe the effects of the arrangement, but such evidence as is available is examined below.49. The benefit conditions differ according as the pensioner was overpension age at 5th July, 1948, or attained pension age thereafter. Theformer class receive a pension of 10s. a week if they have not retired from work or attained age 70 (65 for women) and 26s. if they have, so that itis possible, from age distributions of the numbers in payment at the tworates at the start and the subsequent numbers of pensions raised from 10s.to 26s., to deduce the proportions not retired at each age. The latter class,however, receive no pension until they retire or attain age 70 (65) and current statistics of the numbers attaining the minimum pensionable age who will be entitled to a pension when they retire are not available. Forthese pensioners, therefore, in order to investigate the working of the retire-ment condition, arrangements were made for a continuous sample to beset up, recording the history after pensionable age of a proportion of thoseattaining that age in certain months of each year. This sample will eventuallycover the whole span of five years of age during which the retirement conditionoperates but, at present, data are available only for the first few months.50. As regards men who had been pensioned before 5th July, 1948, columns(1) and (2) of the following table show the percentage proportions at eachage not retired in March, 1949, and in March, 1950. These are comparedwith the proportions not retired which were assumed in the financial estimates for the Bill (column (3)) and with proportions of contributory pensionerswho surrendered stamped contribution cards in 1936 (column (4)). Com-parable figures are not given for women, because these statistics are com-plicated by the fact that many women have a double title to pension;moreover, the pension age for women was 65 in 1936 but is now 60.

From the sample mentioned above of personswho attained pension age after July, 1948, it appears, however, that theproportion of men not retired one month after pension age was about60 per cent., and the proportion not retired about six months after pension age was between 52 per cent: and 54 per cent., compared with the figureof 57 per cent, in column (3) and 56 per cent, in column (4) of the above table.51. The figures in the table are not precisely applicable to future potentialpensioners because the pre-July, 1948, class are normally entitled to a 10s.pension (20s. for a married man with a wife over age 60) even though atwork, and this may affect somewhat their attitude towards retirement. they appear to indicate, however, that the proportion of men who are likely togo on working rather than take a pension involving retirement from work is rather less than was assumed in the estimates. Nevertheless, the propor-tion not retired is substantial; more than one-half of the insured men whoreach age 65 continue at work or remain available for work six months later,and the proportion is still as high as one-third at age 68.For women the assumption was made, more or less arbitrarily, in theoriginal estimates that the proportions of men not retired at each age afterpension age could be applied to women at ages five years younger. Theresults from the sample suggest that the proportion of women not retiredis much lower than was thus assumed ; the percentage of women qualifying for pension at age 60 on their own insurance who have not retired one month after pension age is about 45 per cent, and the percentage who have not retiredabout six months after pension age is just on 40 per cent., compared with the57 per cent, used in the estimates.52. The figures for 1936 given in the above table are included because they provide almost the only available statistics of pre-war experience in thisrespect; they were, moreover, the material on which, with modifications, the assumptions as to retirement were framed for the purpose of the originalfinancial estimates. Comparison of these with the other figures in the tableis, however, complicated by differences in their meaning. The proportion of pensioners who surrendered stamped cards is. for various reasons, not strictly11162
comparable with the proportion of persons who have not retired under the new conditions ; arid neither is quite the same as the proportion of persons atwork; also there are differences in the scope of the population covered. Itis not thought, however, that these differences can be sufficiently large tovitiate broad conclusions, based on the substantial agreement between thefigures in columns (1), (2) and (4) at all ages. There seems to be no indication of any significant difference between the proportions of men at work abovethe minimum pensionable age in 1949 or 1950 with full employment, andthose in 1936, under very different economic conditions and with no systemof increments in pension for deferrnent of retirement. If the changes inpension and in economic conditions have had any marked effect, it mustapparently have been masked by other and opposing influences. But the reservations are important and it would be unwise to attempt to dogmatise onthe strength of these very early results.53. Proportion of population in receipt of age pensions. In the followingTable VIII a comparison is made between the total population of pensionable age, as estimated by the Registrars General, and the respective populations ofcontributory (retirement) pensioners, non-contributory pensioners and all pen-sioners at 31st March, 1950. The numbers of pensioners are expressed as per-centages of the total numbers, for men and women separately, in each quinaryage-group between pensionable age and age 80. The subdivision of the total population into age-groups must be liable to some degree of uncertaintyin view of the time that has elapsed since the last count of the population,and of the possibility of mis-statements of age which is especially great atadvanced ages for which reason those aged 80 and over have been combinedinto one group. Nevertheless, the figures progress reasonably with age andmay be taken as broadly representing the position.Table viii: Percentage proportions of the population of men or women in each age groupwho were in receipt of contributory (retirement) pension or non-contributory pension at 31st March, 1950 (Great Britain)		Men		Women		Age last birthday	Contributory (Retirement) Pensions	Non-contributory Pensions	Total	Contributory (Retirement) Pensions	Non-contributory Pensions	Total60-64 ...... 65-69 ...... 70-74 ...... 75-79 ...... 80 and over   ...

In considering the above table it must be borne in mind that the figuresof contributory (retirement) pensioners for the five years after pensionable age are influenced by the fact that those persons in the group who attain pen-sionable age after 5th July, 1948, are not entitled to a pension unless they haveretired from work. This is the main reason why the proportion of menreceiving contributory pensions between ages 65 and 70 is only 64 per cent, as
compared with 75 per cent, between 70 and 75. The same reason accountsin part for the rise in the proportion of women from 48 per cent, between ages60 and 65 to 67 per cent, between ages 65 and 70, but in this case other andmore important factors are involved, e.g., the increase with age in the pro-portion of women who are entitled to pension on their husbands&apos; insurancebecause the husband himself has attained age 65.The proportions in receipt of contributory pension at ages 65 69 (men)and 60 64 (women) were in fact lower at March, 1950, than a year earlier:64 per cent, against 70 per cent, for men at March, 1949, and 48 per cent,against 50 per cent, for women. These declines are due to the effect of the retirement condition for new pensioners and, as will be appreciated from theconsideration of this subject in paragraphs 48 to 52 above, it is to be expectedthat the percentages pensioned at these ages will decline still further if the retirement condition succeeds in its object.55. It will be seen that after age 70 when the retirement condition is nolonger operative, and when non-contributory pensions (dependent on a means test) are payable as well as retirement pensions four-fifths of the population are in receipt of pensions of one sort or another. This is equally true formen and for women. The remaining one-fifth comprises, in the main, personswho were not insured under the old Contributory Pensions Acts when theyattained pension age and who, when they attained 70, did not claim, orsatisfy the means test for, the non-contributory old age pension. The propor-tion in receipt of a contributory pension declines somewhat at the mostadvanced ages, though this is partly compensated for by an increase in theproportion of &quot; means &quot; pensioners.; a feature which is due to the greater im-portance, at the oldest ages, of the point referred to in the preceding sentence.The proportion of the over-70 population drawing pension was about 1 percent, greater at March, 1950, than a year earlier, due to the rise in thenumbers entitled to a contributory pension. This gradual rise will continue in the future, and, after the first ten years of the new system, the proportion inreceipt of pension may be expected to increase appreciably as more and more of the classes previously excluded from insurance are replaced by correspond-ing persons who, under the new scheme, will be entitled to pensions.XI. DEATH GRANT56. The death grant, which, by the terms of the Act, became payable ayear after the beginning of the main scheme (viz., from 5th July, 1949), is a benefit new to British social insurance. It takes the form of a lump sum payment on the death of an insured person, or of the wife, widow or child of an insured man, or of the husband, widower or child of an insuredwoman. The standard benefit is  20 for a person over age 18, with pro-gressively lower amounts for children under that age, and it is reducible ona lenient contribution test. Further, as a transitional measure no paymentis to be made on the death of a person who had attained pensionable agebefore 5th July, 1948, and the amount is halved for a person within ten yearsof pensionable age on that date ; and there is no payment in respect of the death under age 10 of children born before 5th July, 1948.57. The assessment of the claims to be expected, under such conditions, inthe early days of the scheme cannot be precise, but it is estimated that if a payment in accordance with the provisions outlined above had been madein every case where a person of appropriate age died in the first nine months(July, 1949, to March, 1950) the cost would have been about  2 millions.The total actual payments in that period amounted to just over  1-J millions.
The difference is to be accounted for by the absence of payments for a variety of reasons which are thought to be of sufficient interest to enumerate,though the proportion falling in each of the main categories cannot be stated : (i) Deaths occurring before 31st March, 1950, where the claim was settled after that date; in later years this &quot; lag &quot; at the end of ayear would be balanced by a corresponding lag at the beginning,but this does not apply for the first period.(ii) Deaths of women (not qualifying on their own insurance) who werewidows when the scheme started or were the wives or widows of pensioners.(iii) Deaths of persons (or their dependants) who were excepted fromcontributing on the ground of low income or for other reasons.(iv) Persons who did not make a claim in respect of a death rankingfor benefit although they were entitled to do so.58. The contribution test for this benefit by which, if less than 45 con-tributions have been paid or credited in the contribution year preceding death,a reduced sum is paid corresponding broadly to the &quot; yearly average &quot; ofcontributions paid or credited since 5th July, 1948 does not seem to have seriously affected the payments. An analysis of the payments in respect ofdeaths of insured men and women in the six months ended 31st December,1949, shows that the reductions below the full rate on this account amountedin the aggregate to less than 1 per cent, of the total payments.XII. CONCLUSION59. Some of the main points of interest brought out by this review of thefirst twenty-one months&apos; working of the new scheme are summarized below:(1) There are nearly 23^ million contributors to the scheme, of whomnearly 21^ millions are employed persons, a little under 1J millionsare self-employed and about \ million are non-employed. Inthe light of the original estimates, made in 1945 on the basis of pre-war information, these figures seem to show that there hasbeen a considerable shift from the classes of self-employed and non-employed persons to the employed class since pre-war days.(2) The scheme started with a reserve fund of nearly  800 millions and a &quot; current account&quot; balance of  100 millions. In the first twenty-one months the total funds increased by about  225millions, i.e., to over  1,100 millions at March, 1950.(3) The income of the fund in the financial year 1949-50 was about 525 millions (apart from some  40 millions collected on behalfof the National Health Service). Of this some  185 millions werecontributed by the insured and  175 millions by employers, and 135 millions were paid from the Exchequer. Nearly  30 millionscame from interest on the funds.(4) The expenditure in the financial year 1949-50 was about  140 millionsless than the income. This was due mainly to the very lightunemployment (between \\ and 2 per cent.) experienced duringthe year, which not only affected the cost of unemployment benefitbut also resulted in larger receipts from contributions.(5) Of the expenditure on benefits, two-thirds is on retirement pensionsand one-sixth on sickness benefit, the expenditure on the various other benefits being small in comparison with these two.
(6) The cost of retirement pensions is expected to increase from some 250 millions to about double this amount in the next 30 years,mainly on account of the increase in the aged population entitledto benefit. As the contribution income will remain relativelystationary, apart from fluctuations due to unemployment, prac-tically the whole of this increase will fall on the Exchequer. Thesmall increase in rates of contribution due next October is designedto relieve the Exchequer of some part of the heavy increase but will produce only about  17 millions a year.(7) Four out of every five persons over age 70 are now receiving eithercontributory or non-contributory pensions.I have the honour to be,Your Lordships&apos; obedient Servant,George H.
