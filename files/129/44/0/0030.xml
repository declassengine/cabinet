THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJfESTVS   GOVERJNMEN&apos;Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1951SECRET Copy No.    3 2CP. (51) 3023rd January, 1951CABINETCHANGES IN THE MALTESE CONSTITUTION IN THE EVENT OF war memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies in the course of preparing plans for the defence of Malta in war it has become apparent that in war defence interests would call for the suspension of the present constitution and the centralisation of power in the Governor. As this would bean important political step, and would require United Kingdom legislation, I feel it desirable to have the concurrence of my colleagues in drawing up plans onthis basis.2. The Maltese Constitution granted in 1947 embodies the principle of dyarchy.Legislative and executive power is reserved to the Governor in respect of a shortlist of &quot; reserved matters,&quot; primarily relating to foreign affairs, defence and theinterests of the Armed Forces. All other matters come under a Cabinet of MalteseMinisters who are responsible to an elected Legislative Assembly. In her domestic affairs Malta possesses responsible government.3. In war Malta would be an operational base and might have to be defendedagainst severe attack. Defence considerations would become paramount. the distinction between &quot; reserved matters &quot; and domestic affairs would become unreal.Bearing in mind also the small size of Malta, it is clear that the civil administration would have to be subordinate to and integrated with the defence of the Islandas a whole. The experience of the 1939-45 war confirms this assumption. More-over, substantial financial aid from His Majesty&apos;s Government would almost certainly be needed in war because of the high cost of civil defence and the drasticcurtailment of local revenue derived from customs duties. Such financial aidwould be difficult to reconcile with the continuation of responsible Government.For all these reasons there would be very serious difficulties in attempting to main-tain the principle of dyarchy, however much the balance of power were shiftedfrom the Maltese to the Imperial side. Efficient administration and co-ordinationwith defence requirements could not be assured if there were two potentiallyoverlapping jurisdictions. A unitary form of government, capable of co-ordinatedaction and quick decisions, and responsible only to His Majesty&apos;s Government,would be essential.4. After consulting the Governor I am satisfied that mere modifications ofthe present Constitution would not meet the case, and that a new form of govern-ment would have to be set up, with all legislative and - executive power vested in the Governor, assisted by an Executive Council appointed by him. TheLegislative Assembly would have to be dissolved and Maltese Ministers would cease to hold office. The Governors Executive Council should contain, as well assenior officials, a certain number of Maltese (perhaps four) nominated by him, toensure the representation of local opinion; but they would not be responsible to the maltese electorate. The Governor would retain final authority, both legislative and executive, and would not be obliged to act upon the advice of his ExecutiveCouncil. Co-ordination with the Services would be effected through a DefenceCommittee, such as exists at present, comprising the Governor and the local headsof the three Services.40013
5. The Governor advises me that the suspension of the Constitution in theevent of war and its replacement by a new Constitution on these lines would, sofar as can be foreseen, be understood by and acceptable to Maltese public opinion,which would expect us to resume control when defence considerations becomeparamount. In order to secure Maltese acquiescence it would, however, be essential, and right, to give an assurance that the present Constitution would be restored when the emergency was over.6. Some parts of the present Constitution can be modified by use of the prerogative, but a suspension of the whole Constitution could be effected only underpowers specially granted by Act of Parliament. There is a theoretical alternativefor which provision already exists, namely, suspending the Constitution with theconcurrence of the Maltese Prime Minister of the day; but it would be impossibleto plan on the assumption of getting his active concurrence, and the Governor advisesme that it would be unlikely to be forthcoming, although passive acquiescencecould be expected. The Governor also advises me that action by Parliament herewould make the change more acceptable in Malta. It would therefore be necessary if the emergency arose, to introduce a short Bill into Parliament conferring onHis Majesty a general power to legislate for Malta by Order in Council. For the avoidance of doubts, the Bill would give an express power to revoke or amend anyof the provisions of the Malta (Constitution) Letters Patent 1947. Immediatelyafter the passing of this Act, which should take little time, an Order in council would then be made under it, suspending the present Maltese Constitution and setting up the new one. The Order in Council would provide that the 1947Constitution would come back into operation when the emergency was over.7. It is distasteful to have to think of withdrawing responsible government from Malta, even though temporarily, but I see no other satisfactory way of meeting our defence requirements. I have consulted the Chiefs of Staff and theyare in agreement with my view. I therefore invite my colleagues to agree (i) That the present Maltese Constitution would have to be suspended in theevent of war and replaced by a temporary Constitution vesting all legis-lative and executive power in the Governor;(ii) that if the necessity arises a Bill should be introduced into Parliamentgranting powers to bring this change about;(hi) that plans should be drawn up now on the above assumptions.J. G.Colonial Office, S.W. 1,23rd January, 1951.
