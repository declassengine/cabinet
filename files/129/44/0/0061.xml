PHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOYERNMENT    v printed for the Cabinet. February 1951CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.CP. (51) 6123rd February, 1951CABINETDELEGATION OF RESPONSIBILITY TO JUNIOR MINISTERS and parliamentary SECRETARIESNote by the Prime minister the increasing strain on Ministers of the burden of departmental work make sit desirable that the services of Junior Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries shouldbe fully utilised. It also gives the latter valuable experience. I should thereforelike to remind my colleagues of what was said in a previous note which I circulated on this subject (CP. (49) 31, paragraph 3). Wherever possible the parliamentary secretary should be given definite responsibility for particular sections of the work under the Minister, with the responsibility of taking decisions subject to referenceto the Minister in all cases of disagreement between the Parliamentary secretary and the officials.2. The extent to which responsibility can be delegated varies necessarily indifferent Departments, but Ministers should be on the look-out for opportunities of doing this. Ministers will no doubt wish to bring Parliamentary Secretariesinto consultation on all suitable occasions.3. I should be obliged if Ministers in charge of Departments would let mehave a short memorandum on the extent to which they are able to delegate.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,23rd February, 1951.
