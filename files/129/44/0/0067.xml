km-DOCUMENT-IS-THE PROPERTY OF-fflS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S-GO-V--E-government NT)SECRETCP.(51) 6.7 COPY NO. 35TH MARCH, 1951CABINETWAR PENSIONS AND ALLOWANCESMemorandum by the Minister of pensions in accordance with the advice of my colleagues I have, in thelight of the debate on 16th February on the Motion on War Pensions,reconsidered the proposals which came before&apos; the Cabinet on 1 5thFebruary (CM,(.(51). 14th Conclusions, Minute 1).2. I attach at Appendix A a copy of the Resolution and of the terms(agreed with the Lord President and the Chancellor of the Exchequer) inwhich I accepted it.3. The debate showed a balance of opinion in favour of a rise inthe basic rate of disablement pension, but some speakers on the Govern-ment side thought that in view of the cost of any substantial increase,improvements in the supplementary allowances would be preferable.There was general support for an increase in widows&apos; pensions.4. Basic rate for 100 per cent disablement pension (other ranks).The basic rate for a private soldier was fixed at 40s. Od in 1919, and wasto be subject to periodic review in accordance with the cost of living.In February, 1946, it was raised to 45s. Od to match the Industrial Injuryrate.    The main ex-Service organisations have since pressed stronglyfor substantial increases, which would bring the rate to at least 60s.0d.In the debate on 16th February Sir Ian Fraser claimed that on the rise inthe cost of living since 1938 the rate should be 76s.Od.5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed Sir Ian Fraser on 16thFebruary that the present purchasing power of the  1 is about 16s. 3dcompared with 20s. Od in 1946.    On this basis the 45s. Od given in 1946 isnow worth 36s. 7d and the equivalent today of 45s. Od in 1946 is just over55s. Od.    An increase of 10s.Cd is therefore fully justified.6. Proposal.     That an increase of 10s. Od be made in the 100 percent disablement rate for all other ranks with corresponding increases for lower degrees of disablement.    Some 6 5 8,000 men would be affected.The cost, which would decrease gradually in the absence of a major war,would be  6,900,000 a year.7. Rates of higher pension for widows (other ranks) who are over40, have children or are incapable of work.   The rate for the widow of aprivate soldier is 35s, Od.    It was fixed in 1946, and in terms of corn-par ative purchasing power its value is now 28s.5d.    The equivalent of35s. Od in 1946 would today be 43s. Id.-1-1
8. Nearly all the speakers in the debate stressed the need  or anincrease in the pensions of elderly widows and those with children.The ex-Service organisations have pressed for a minimum of 50s. 01a week.    The average age of widows of the 1914 war is about 60 andmany are over that age.    Most of the 1939 war widows have children.9. Proposal.    That an increase of 5s. Od be made in the higher rateof pension for widows of other ranks.    131,000 widows would benefit atan annual cost of  1,700,000.10. In my opinion the increases proposed above would go a longway to satisfying the agitation for improvements in war pensions whichare summarised in the twelve points put to my predecessor by the mainex-Service organisations (see Appendix B).    They would cost 8,600,000 a year.    On the grounds of cost I am not proposing any increase in the rates for commissioned officers or officers1 widows,although increases can be justified in both cases.   (The rates forcommissioned officers - except captains - are the same as those fixed in 1920;  officers&apos; widows were given some increases in 1944.)    Therise of 10s. Od in the 100 per cent disablement rate for other ranks will,however, necessitate a small increase ( 15 a year) in the rate for navalwarrant officers and midshipmen who would otherwise receive less thanarmy warrant officers who are of lower rank.       The cost would be only 6,000 a year.11. Alternative Proposals.   If the present financial situation forbidsthe acceptance of the above proposals, I must press for increases of one half of the rates proposed (i. e. 5s.Od on the 100 per cent rate for other  .ranks disablement pensions and 2s. 6d on the &apos;higher rate1 for other ranks widows at a cost of  4,300,000) and for the following improvements in supplementary allowances.12.   (1)   An increase in the Unemployability Supplement by 5s.Od to35s. Od a week for officers and other ranks.       This supplement is givento pensioners who are virtually permanently unemployable as a resultof their pensioned disablement.    A 100 per cent pensioner with a wife and one child draws, with the supplement at 30s. Od and an additional6s. Od for his wife, 98s. 6d a week.     This is much below the average earnings of an industrial worker.    He cannot receive sickness benefit or retirement pension.    These pensioners are not getting the benefitof rising wages and are hard hit by the increase in the cost of living.The number affected would be about 20,005 at a cost of  26.0,000 a year.(2)   A Comforts Allowance of 10s. Od a week to be provided forcertain totally disabled pensioners - officers and other ranks.This proposal is designed to give recognition to the most seriously disabled pensioners.     There are two classes concerned.     Thefirst consists of about 4,500 pensioners whose disabilities affect them so seriously as to qualify them for both the Unemployability Supplement andthe Constant Attendance Allowance.    Life has little to hold for them orfor their wives, and a little extra help is justified in view of the increased cost of living.    The second class is a much smaller one and has a specialappeal:  it consists of possibly less than 1, 000 men suffering frommultiple injuries of the utmost severity, who have so far overcome theirdreadful handicaps as to be able to work.    It includes men suffering fromtriple amputations, blindness and amputation, paraplegia and blindness oramputation, or other combinations of disablement of comparable severity.
-    &apos;33fiSpecial.pleas on their behalf were made in the debate by Sir Ian Fraserand Mr. Richard Wood.    The allowance would benefit about 5,400pensioners at a cost of about  140,000 a year.(3)   The qualifying rent figure for rent allowance to widows of other ranks with children to be lowered from 8s.Od to 6s. Od.This would give an extra 2s. Od a week to 23,000 widows who now have rent allowances, and a small allowance up to 2s.Od a week to another12,000.    The cost would be about  162,000 a year.13.

APPENDIX a motion by Brigadier Head on Pro.day, 16th February, 1951That this House views with concern the situationwhich, owing to the increase in the cost of living,now confronts those in receipt of war pensions;    and while recognising the difficulties of the present financial situation,- expresses the hope that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will review this question to ensure that.therate of war pensions conforms with the national obligationtowards those concerned.Statement by Minister of PensionsI close this debate by making this considered,statement to the House.    The Motion now before the Houserefers to the need, for recognising the difficulties ofthe present financial situation, and that indeed musthave due weight and full consideration in my approach to the numerous points raised in the debate. The Motionfurther expresses the hope that His Majesty1s Governmentwill review the position.    I can satisfy the hope for review.    The debate has shown that the problem is notjust one question but many questions.    The term &quot;warpension&quot; is not related exclusively to the basic rates or to any percentage of disability, but to manysupplementary items of cash and kind covered by theRoyal Warrant.    They will all be reviewed in relationto the difficulties of the present financial situationwhich we know to be most formidable.    In the light ofthe debate, backed-by the spirit of this Motion, andin the light of what I have said, I accept the motion on behalf of the Government.
