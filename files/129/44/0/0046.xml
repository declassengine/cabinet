I DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST y &apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET   .C. P. (51) 46 , COPY NO10TH FEBRUARY, 1951CABINET. 31KOREA:   THE 38TH PARALLEL    ,Memorandum by the Minister of StateIntroduction.     On 25th January United Nations Forces in Koreabegan a reconnaissance in force with the object of reaching the south bankof the Han River, below Seoul.    The primary object of this operation was toobtain information abou t the present disposition of the Chinese forces.By 6th February United Nations Forces had reached a point some eight miles south of Seoul.2. In view of the success of this operation, urgent consideration hasbeen given to the position that will arise if United Nations Forces againreach the 38th Parallel, and in particular to the following points:-(a) Whether it is possible or desirable to hold a position in korea;(b) The best line to hold;(c) Whether it would be advisable militarily and politically to recrossthe 38th Parallel.3. These three questions have been considered in the context of -(a) willingness on the part of the Central People&apos;s Government ofChina, whether as a result of the efforts of the Good Offices Committeecontemplated in the resolution passed on 1st February, or in any other circumstances, to discuss a negotiated settlement, and(b) refusal on the part of the Central People&apos;s Government to enterinto any such discussions and a continued advance of United Nations Forces upto the 38th Parallel.4. Recommendations.      It is recommend:(1)   that in neither of the situations described in paragraph 3 above shouldUnited Nations Forces seek to advance beyond,or hold a line north of, the38th Parallel;(2) that-it should be confirmed from the United States Government thatthere can be no question of a military decision to advance beyond the 38thParallel until a political decision has been taken, and that the latter decisiondoes not rest with the United States alone, but with the United Nations and,in particular, with those members who are contributing to the United nations forces in Korea;
(1)   every effort should still be made to bring the Chinese to negotiatewhile restricting the conflict to Korea and avoiding any action that might precipitate an extension of hostilities.   A line firmly held on the 38thParallel would appear to offer the best chances of this;(2) Asian and Arab susceptibilities would be better safeguarded, since it was the Indian Government which conveyed to us last time a warning fromthe Chinese that the crossing of the 38th Parallel would provoke Chineseintervention;(3) a drive into North Korea, however deep and however successful,would not finally destroy the enemy or end hostilities but on the contrarywould be likely to extend the conflict;(4) unwelcome as the prospect would be, we may, in the event of negotiations proving fruitless, be faced ultimately with the possibilities of:(a) keeping United Nations Forces indefinitely in Korea (which can,I think, be ruled out);(b) withdrawing from Korea and leaving it to the mercy of the Chinese and North Koreans (a highly unsatisfactory outcome);(c) selecting a line which might be held by the South Koreans themselves.Assuming that the United Nations decided to attempt to build upSouth Korean forces for the purpose the best position for such a linewould appear to be south of the 3 8th Parallel.7. A first approach has already been made to the State Department byHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador i n Washington.    Their preliminary viewalso is that a halt should in any case be called at the 3 8th Parallel, and -(3) that in the event of a line being chosen south of the 38th Parallel,while there would of course be no question of a major crossing of the 38thParallel by United Nations land forces, even minor penetrations &quot;and assaultsshould, if possible, be avoided,5. Arguments.     The Chiefs of Staff, after an examination of themilitary considerations, have concluded:(1) that, if we are to achieve the object for which United Nations Forceswent to Korea, it is essential to hold a position covering, as great an area ofthe country as possible up to the 38th Parallel;(2) that there is no military reason, in view of the latest developments,why this should not be possible;(3) that the best military line to hold is one on the &quot;Southern Waist&quot;of Korea, covering Seoul and Inchon, and thence following roughly the lineof the .38th Parallel;(4) that, if there is to be a cease-fire, involving establishment of ademilitarised zone, its southern border should run along the &quot;SouthernWaist&quot; line.6. I agree with conclusion (l) above and consider that, for the followingpolitical reasons also, a halt should in any case be made on the line of the38th Parallel:
that this line should again be crossed only after careful consideration and full consultation among the Powers principally concerned.8. Lord Tedder has been requested by the Chiefs of Staff to put theirviews to the United States Chiefs of Staff and a telegram has also beensent to His MajestyTs Ambassador in Washington, instructing him to discussthe matter further with the State Department on the lines of the considerationsoutlined in paragraph 6 above on a provisional basis subject to cabinet approval.I invite endorsement of the recommendations in paragraph 4 aboveinstructions sent to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington.K. G. Y.Foreign Office, S. W. 1. ,10TH FEBRUARY, 1951.
