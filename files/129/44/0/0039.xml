?HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(51) 39 COPY6TH FEBRUARY, 1951CABINETSULPHURMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI feel it my duty to bring to the attention of my colleagues theserious position which has developed over supplies of sulphur andsulphuric acid.     It represents to my mind the most serious threat thathas developed to the maintenance of our economy and the fulfilment of our defence programme.2. Annexed to this memorandum is a note prepared in my Depart-ment showing the causes and extent of the crisis in sulphur supplies.As will be seen from the note, I had been taking steps, even beforeKorea, to halt the expansion in sulphur consumption in this country,since I feared that the gradual exhaustion of United States reserves might at some time reduce our supplies.     The scramble for materials in theUnited States and the imposition of export licensing by the United StatesGovernment have been followed by a totally inadequate allocation to thiscountry.3. Urgent steps are being taken to reduce our dependence on imported sulphur by the conversion of a considerable number of sulphuricacid plants to the use of pyrites (iron sulphide).     Plans are being con-sidered for the use in the longer term of our native anhydrite (calciumsulphate).     Methods of recovering sulphur from coke ovens and power station gases are being urgently examined, while the possibility of tappingsulphur in the course of oil production by British companies here and overseas is being urgently investigated.     But I must emphasise that none of these measures can do anything materially to relieve the situation untilthe end of next year, much less to prevent or mitigate the grave dislocation-tion of our industry which appears inevitable in the next two or threemonths.4. Since the first indication of our prospective allocation was made,sulphur and sulphuric acid have been put back on full control, and the materials (Allocation) Committee under the Chairmanship of the economic secretary to the Treasury have been preparing a system of allocations.An indication of the probable allocation is made in paragraphs 14 - 1 5 ofthe Annex, though the Report of the Materials (Allocation) Committee will undoubtedly involve decisions by Ministers at the Production Committee.Whatever adjustments there may be in individual programmes. cannot alter the clear fact that the sulphur shortage will deal a grave blow to our economy.5. As will be seen from the paragraph to which I have referred, itis likely that efforts will be made to limit the cuts falling on the iron andsteel and oil refining industries, on oils and fats, metal extraction,
explosives, etc.     But I am seriously apprehensive of the consequences of the probable 20 per cent cut in the general chemical industry, for itsproducts affect the whole complex of industrial production, and the effects of such a cut are literally immeasurable.     It is significant that in the worst period of the dollar crisis, when practically every importantdollar material, from cotton to softwood was being cut, no reduction was made in the allocation of sulphur to the chemical industry.     -Ishould make it clear again that I am not appealing for any redistribution of allocations:   if one were made more favourable to the chemical industry it could only be at the expense of an even more important use.6. An illustration of the effect of the cuts which will be necessarycan be seen from the rayon industry.     This is an industry which has been built up painfully and at a heavy cost in capital investment in the criticalyears of our recovery.     It is playing a big part in exports:-   in 1950 thetotal exports of rayon yarn, fibre and piece goods amounted to  47. 8millions,  2. 8 millions going to North America,     It has been playing an increasing part in providing cheap clothing and household textiles in place of the much dearer cotton and wool materials.     We were looking to it for much further substitution for wool and cotton, principally inmixtures.     Now it is likely to be cut by 40 per cent.     The effects interms of employment are not easy to measure, but my Departmentestimate that 49,000 workers in the textile industries will be unemployed(or a correspondingly greater number under-employed).     Those of mycolleagues who have been concerned with the drive for increased produc-tivity in the cotton industry (which uses a great deal of rayon in both the spinning and weaving sections) will realise that only a fraction of this figure of unemployment would spell the end for many years of re-deploy-ment in the industry, and a return to the restrictive practices from whichwe are only slowly succeeding in weaning workers and employers alike.The effect on exports will be serious.     I have already had to order areduction to one quarter of exports of rayon yarn and staple fibre.     Ifwe do not more than maintain exports of piece goods - and C.P.(51) 20called for a substantial increase in the exports of textiles and clothing -the supply of rayon goods for the home market would be reduced to 45per cent of the 1950 rate.     Since industrial needs are heavy, the supply for the consumer would be cut even more sharply.7. Since the implications of the prospective allocations became clear a week ago I have, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer -(i)     through the Economic Secretary, Treasury, and the parliamentary secretary to the Board of Trade, fully briefed Lord Knollys,United Kingdom representative on the Washington Raw MaterialsGroup Organisation, on the sulphur position;(ii)      sent a telegram to H.M. Ambassador in Washington (PRIMENo. 469), setting out the implications as we saw them, asking him to consider with Lord Knollys what immediate steps should be taken in Washington, and inviting him to advise us of the manner in which an even higher-level approach could usefully be made;   and(iii)     with the Chancellor, seen Mr.  William Batt, Head of theEconomic Co-operation Administration Mission in London,and briefed him on the position, preparatory to his returnto Washington for consultations.
8. I now invite my colleagues to agree that we have reached apoint - feared by Ministers some months ago, and the subject of clearwarnings by the Prime Minister to the President - where it isnecessary to bring home to the United States Administration the factthat Success in achieving our defence programme, and indeed in maintaining our economy, depends on measures by them, acting aspartners in a common effort; to ensure that we receive our minimumsupplies.     Accordingly I suggest that, taking into account the advicewe receive from H.M. Ambassador in reply to the telegram we have sent, a high-level approach be made to the United States Government,stressing the implications of their decision, and warning them of thetragic consequences which would follow large-scale unemployment andindustrial dislocation in circumstances which would enable the communists and their lackeys to whip up anti-American feeling in thiscountry.H.W.Board of Trade, S.W.1,6TH FEBRUARY, 1951.
AnnexSUPPLIES OF SULPHUR AND SULPHURIC ACIDNot eiM by the Boar d^ of trade.      Our supplies of crude sulphur coma exclusively fromthe United States of America which produces 95 per cent of world supplies.     The normal pattern is for some three-quarters of the imports to be used in the manufactureof sulphuric acid, and the remainder (&quot;regular&quot; sulphur)directly in industry as a raw material for which there isno substitute,2.      In 1950, our consumption of sulphur was as follows:-Sulphuric Acid manufacture    .... 356,000 tonsGeneral Industrial Purposes .... 105,000 tons1+61,000&quot;The pace of industrial expansion woo such, however, thatour requirements were rising throughout the year.      Had wenot, for reasons set out in paragraph 5 cut back theproduction of fertilisers, the annual rate in the lastauarter of the year would have boon of the order of500,000 tons.3.      Our forward estimate of acid sulphur requirements for1951 was 335,000 tons, which allowed for the continuanceof the cut made in superphosphate production to save sulphur.The demand for regular sulphur was assessed at 105,000 tonsnet.     The United States of America, realising there was nosubstitute, have hitherto met our reasonable requirements for regular sulphur.h.      About two and a half years ago,  the American sulphurproducers  (who were kept fully informed of forwardrequirements)  said they could not see their way clear toprovide more sulphur than was needed for acid plants then in operation or being erected.     This limited acid sulphursupplies to an annual rate of 380,000 tons.     No buildinglicence for a sulphur-burning acid, plant has been issuedsince then, although plans for capacity requiring a further120,000 tons of sulphur per year have been before the Boardof Trade.     This policy was strongly contested by industrysince sulphur is a much cheaper form of production thanpyrites or anhydrite.     For a year arguments continued with both 1,0,1, Ltd, and Oourtaulds who were not prepared toaccept our decision not to allow the erection of furthersulphuric acid plants designed to operate on sulphur.5,      While the- Americans referred to supply difficultieswhen fixing the ceiling of 330,000 tons, no suggestion wasmade before June 1950 that they would be unable to meet requirements&apos; for acid manufacture within that total.     they then decided, owing to the fall in their visible reserves,35   Includes 5,000 tons homo production from spent oxide. and approximately-10,000 tons re-exported as processed sulphur.Consumption of acid sulphur was lower than it would havebeen because of the cut in superphosphate productionreferred to later.
ANNEXSUPPLIES OF SULPHUR AND SULPHURIC ACIDNote by the Board of TradeI.      Our supplies of crude sulphur coma exclusively fromthe United States of America which produces 95 per cent of world supplies.

About two and a half years ago,  the American sulphurproducers (who were kept fully informed of forwardrequirements)  said they could not see their way clear toprovide more sulphur than was needed for acid plants then in operation or being erected.

Ltd.  and Courtaulds who were not prepared toaccept our decision not to allow the erection of furthersulphuric acid plants designed to operate on sulphur.5,      While the- Americans referred to supply difficultieswhen fixing the ceiling of 330,000 tons, no suggestion wasmade before June 1950 that they would be unable to meet requirements for acid manufacture within that total.     they then decided, owing to the fall in their visible reserves,55   Includes 5,000 tons bone production from spent oxide, and approximately-10,000 tons re-oxportod as processed sulphur.Consumption of acid sulphur was lower than it would havebeen because of the cut in superphosphate productionreferred to later.
to cut supplies for the remainder of 1950 and indicated thatthe United Kingdom would he unwise to plan to use more foracid making than 300,000 tons in 1951.      There was still no indication that the full requirement of regular sulphur forgeneral industrial use would not be met.     Action was taken immediately to cut superphosphate production by 300,000 tons per year (equivalent to 50,000 tons of sulphur) and continental purchases were made to cover the loss.      On this basis it was hoped that in 1951 plants could have been maintained without any further material cuts in production,though this depended on the United States of America producersagreeing under pressure to provide more than 300,000 tons.Expansion of output would however have been restricted except where firms were erecting plants to operate on pyrites orother materials,6.     Late in October, 1950, reports began to reach us thatthe United States Government were contemplating putting sulphurunder export control and that allocations would be made tothe various importing countries which would be below theirpresent takings.     Although no definite information could beobtained, by our Embassy in Washington,  the situation was regarded as sufficiently serious for representations to bemade to the American agencies concerned by the party of officials which visited Washington in November last todiscuss raw material shortages.      The place of sulphur in our industrial economy was explained to them at length and theywere pressed to provide us with 330,000/3h.0,000 tons of acidsulphur and 100,000 tons of regular sulphur in 1951 and 1952,during which period we hoped to press on with our plans forgradually turning over the acid making industry from sulphurto other sulphur-bearing materials such as pyrites and ourown native anhydrite,7.     When the Prime Minister visited Washington in December,he drew the attention of the President to the vitalimportance to our economy of sulphur as a raw material andfurther discussions took place with the American agencies inwhich the position was again explained in detail.8.     At intervals during this period, we joined with other0. E.E.G.  countries in the preparation of reports on sulphurand this was one of the materials which the O.E.E.C. Mission,which visited Washington in December, discussed with the americans.     Allocations were not made until 18th December,when we were given 8l,h65 tons for the first quarter of 1951as against a requirement of roughly 112,000 tons and we have continued to press for an increased allocation.      (We stilldo not know what we shall receive after the first quarter ofthis year.)9.      Strong representations were immediately made at our request by the Embassy in Washington and these have been continuously followed up, but owing to the constantly changingorganisation and personalities in Washington during recent weeks, it has not been possible to find anyone at a sufficiently high level with the appropriate authority with whom to press our case.
10,      The allocation involved a reduction in our requirementsof sulphur by 28 per cent of 1950 consumption.      In the caseof regular sulphur, for which there is no substitute, the cut takes full effect but in the case of acid sulphur theloss of acid as a percentage of total production is18-20 per cent as some h5 per cent of our acid supplies are made from other sulphur-bearing materials,      (There isa complication that oleum and strong acid required by certain industries Is mostly made from sulphur while other materialsnormally yield weak acid, much of it being arsenical,)11,      Arrangements were already in progress to introduceStatutory Control when the allocation was&apos;announced and theorders came into operation on 8th January,  1951.     As atemporary measure, pending decisions on the cuts in consumption which would have to be applied to individual industries,  it was decided, to meet the deficit in the caseof regular sulphur by cutting carbon bisulphide manufacture(mainly for rayon and transparent paper)  and the rubberindustry  (for vulcanising) by 15 per cent, and all otherusers by 30 per cent.     All users of sulphur acid were cut by 33 per cent except rayon and transparent paper wherethe cut was 15 per cent to match their carbon bisulphide-,bromine for anti-knock,  and one special dycstuffs plantwhere a similar 15 per cent cut was applied.      In some areas,the acid cut so far as a particular undertaking is concernedhas not been so great since, owing to local conditions,  acertain amount of acid made from other materials has been available if it could be used.      Special arrangements havehad to be made subsequently to meet urgent cases, e,g, forvegetable oil refining for the fat ration, and for sulphatingammonia at coke ovens.      All producers of acid and processorsof regular sulphur had been asked to furnish particulars of deliveries to individual customers for the period april-September 1950,  and from these returns a schedule of consumption by a wide range of industries, built up indetail, has formed the basis of work which has been donein the last few weeks,  in collaboration with the chairmanof the Materials (Allocation) Committee to consider how theshortages should fall upon particular industries,12,      The basic importance of sulphur and sulphuric acidand the close assessment which has been made of the effectof the cut imposed by the United States of America on our supplies make&quot;it apparent that the shortages will involve considerable dislocation of all essential industries inthe country because all of them consume sulphur or sulphuricacid either directly, or indirectly in other products,particularly chemicals.      It is clear that tho sulphurshortage is one of the most serious difficulties we haveto face,13,      The Materials (Allocation) Committee will be making proposals to the Production Committee shortly for theallocation of available supplies between industries.The Board of Trade understands that the proposals will cover actual allocations of regular sulphur to using industries while, in the case of acid,  industries will beplaced in categories by percentages and the Department will endeavour to meet requirements up to those percentages.
The redistribution of our supplies of sulphuric acid willtake time to accomplish because some 50 per cent of the acidis consumed in the works where it is produced and cannotreadily be moved elsewhere,  and some areas of the  country &quot;are more deficient in supplies as against requirements than others.11+.     The aim will be to maintain at as high a rate aspossible key industries such as iron and steel pickling,mineral end vegetable oil refining, metal extraction,explosives and tar distillation.      On the other hand, itis estimated that rayon production (which dominates thesulphur shortage as it consurm s about one-fifth of our supplies either in the form of carbon bisulphide or of acid)will have to fall to some 70 per cent of the average productionin 1950 and 60 per cent of the rate at the end of 1951.The implications of this shortage on our textile supplies are obvious and are particularly serious at a time when weare short of our requirements of American cotton.     The outputof the rubber industry will have to be cut to 70 per cent,though - arrangements will be made with the industry to produceessential items such as conveyor belting for the mines and heavy duty tyres.     In most cases, the chemical industry,including such general service materials as dyestuffs andsulphur dioxide, will be cut to 80 per cent of requirements.At the other end of the scale, the cuts on such industries as matches,  transparent paper and lithopone  (used for paint)will be much more severe.15.    In the case of chemicals  in particular, the fall in output will make it necessary for industry to receive adviceas to the disposal between industries of their products.Detailed investigations are already in hand for this purpose and it  is hoped that the necessary arrangements can be controlled by voluntary action.     The Materials  (Allocation)Committee- will be asked to advise in. cases where this isnecessary,16.     To sum up, the American allocation for the 1st quarter,representing an annual rate of some 325,000 tons, is some30&quot;, 000 tons a quarter or 120,000 tons a year below our requirements if our economy is to be maintained.      (Even so,this would still not allow the resumption of full productionin the fertiliser industry).     Allowing for the additional requirements from such projects as the Margam steel plant,which comes into operation in the autumn and the Grangemouthoil project our additional requirements over the first quarter allocation are at an annual rate of some 130,000 tons.This amount and a similar figure for 1952 are required as an urgent short-term contribution to. the maintenance of our economy and the fulfilment of our defence programme.     steps are already in hand for converting some of our sulphuric acidplants from sulphur to other sulphur-bearing materials suchas pyrites and methods are now being urgently explored for greater recovery of sulphur from coke ovens and from thegases of oil refineries and power stations.     A further report will be submitted on the above programme when it ispossible to say accurately what facilities it needs andwhen probable supplies of alternative materials can be assessed.Board of Trade,Millbank,.S.W.1.6TH FEBRUARY.  195.1* ,
