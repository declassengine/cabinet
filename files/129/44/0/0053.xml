THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS   GOVERNMENT^   264Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1951SECRET copy No. 31CP. (51) 5322nd February, 1951CABINETEXPENDITURE ON OVERSEAS INFORMATION SERVICES, 1951-52Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Minister ofState and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Common-wealth relations the Chancellor has proposed to cut the Overseas Information Estimates of 1T 7 million by  1 - 55 million. It is recommended that the cuts should be reducedto  900,000.2. With the intensification of the &quot; cold war &quot; the role of the Overseas Infor-mation Services partakes more and more of the nature of political warfare. the aim throughout is twofold: to strengthen, enlighten and invigorate the forces on both sides of the Iron Curtain which are opposed to Soviet communism, and toattack and expose the Kremlin&apos;s ideologies, policies and propaganda. The first part of this task is as important as the second.3. The &quot; Departmental Information &quot; work is done by small staffs in foreigncountries, in the Colonies and the self-governing countries of the Commonwealth,working all the time through their contacts with the press,, broadcasting agencies,newsreels, political parties, societies, prominent anglo-phils and any other meansof influencing the public to secure as full a representation as possible of the viewsof His Majesty&apos;s Government and of British opinion on current questions, and an understanding of this country and of British democratic methods and ideals. TheDepartmental Information Services also supply unofficially to suitable contacts anti-communist articles and information for use by the latter without disclosure of theirBritish origin.4. The role of the British Broadcasting Corporation Overseas Services is well-known. Suffice it to say that they are listened to and valued and that they are wellattuned to the purposes of the &quot;cold war.&quot; They are our only means of puttingBritish views and news to the peoples of the Iron Curtain countries where (exceptin Russia, because of the jamming), they are much listened to and what they say is passed on widely by word of mouth.5. There is much ignorance and prejudice about the present-day activities ofthe British Council. Since successive large cuts in its budget, the CounciFs work is to a very large extent concentrated upon educational work, establishing contacts between British and foreign scientists, doctors, research workers, &amp;c, and makingknown the British way of life and British achievements. The fine arts and more&quot; rarefied &quot; side of the CounciTs work has been reduced to a minimum and is nowconfined to special cases, agreed to be desirable on political grounds as making anacknowledged contribution to British prestige and for fufilling our obligations underCultural Conventions. All the British CounciFs work is done in close consultationwith the relevant overseas department and with His Majesty&apos;s representatives in thecountry, dominion or colony concerned.; There is no doubt that the British CounciFs40143
work at home and overseas is a most valuable form of propaganda for the Britishand Western way of life, and thus makes its contribution in the &quot; cold war &quot; as it did in the last war.t. 0 6. The Commonwealth Relations Office share the view of the Foreign office i  . and the Colonial Office that the Chancellors latest proposal does not affect thearguments previously advanced by the overseas departments. A cut of the magnitude-tude which he still proposes would have a most serious effect upon our capacity tofight the &quot; cold war &quot; and would place us in an extremely difficult position if warcame upon us suddenly. Any further economy in the services for which theCommonwealth Relations Office are responsible would have to be found in the mainby additional cuts in the British CounciFs expenditure in India and Pakistan wherethe Councils work is regarded not only by the Commonwealth Relations Office,but by the Prime Ministers of those countries as being of very great value.7. As regards the British Council, the concern of the Secretary of State forthe Colonies is solely with its work in the colonies, where the Council has a very special part to play in the field of Overseas Information. (This does not refer totheir work in running hostels in this country for colonial students, since this isseparately financed and does not arise in this context.) Unlike other departments,the Colonial Office do not now maintain their own information staff in the coloniesthemselves. This was done in one or two regions in recent years but, although itworked well, the organisations were disbanded on grounds of economy. This means that for the dissemination of information on the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, the Colonial Office have to rely very largely on such proportion of the timeand energy of the staff of local Governments as can be given to this task. Now forthe most part the provision for public relations made by colonial Governments isnot very great. The officers and departments concerned are employed and paidby the local Governments and are more than fully occupied with purely local work(of which may be instanced the excellent work done by the Gold Coast Public Rela-tions Department in preparing the way in the recent first General Election in that territory). The British Council therefore constitutes in the Colonies the only agencyworking under direct United Kingdom control, and in this respect its position inthe Colonies differs significantly from its position in foreign and commonwealth countries. Moreover the work of the British Council in the colonies, after yearsof pruning and careful adaptation to purpose in consultation with colonial governments, contains no frills. It deals mainly in adult educational matters inthe broadest sense and constitutes a quite unique medium for fostering good race relations. Through its agency, all races and sections of the community are brought together on the common ground of interest in cultural and public matters, and theSecretary of State for the Colonies regards this bringing together in itself as of muchgreater importance, relatively, than the precise subject matter of the particularoccasion which does it. In this view he has the strong support of colonial governors, many of whom, while appreciating the other work that is done, have gone so far as to ask that, if additional funds can be provided for Overseas Informa-tion work, all or a large proportion of them should go to the British Council.8. It must be borne in mind that these successive requests for economies in overseas Information work have come at a time when world costs have been rising.If this double pressure goes on at the same average rate as it has since 1947, by theend of next year we shall only be able to do about a third of the propaganda wewere doing four years ago.9. The offer which the Overseas Departments have made to reduce the&apos;1951-52 Estimates by  900,000 entails, inter alia, the following effects upon the workof the Foreign Office Information services, whose cost would be reduced by  322,000to  2,049,000.(a) Posts in most European capitals will be reduced to a staff which will be unable to do more than maintain minimum contacts with the press;contacts with others who are influential in forming public opinion willbe largely lost. The flow of written material from London will be greatly reduced and the use of visual media at these posts largelyabandoned.(b) Similar reductions will have to be made in all major posts in latin america and the remainder will have to be abandoned.
(c) Production of films for all the Overseas Departments will have to be halvedand, except in the Middle East, South-East Asia and the United States,their use will largely cease. This will be a serious loss; apart fromtheir direct value as a medium of propaganda, films provide an irre-placeable means by which an Information Officer can maintain contact with leaders of opinion outside the city where he is based. By thesesacrifices we shall lose another important means of winning friends and denying them to the enemy.(d) The series of magazines now being published in European languages will be discontinued.10. The reduction offered on behalf of the British Broadcasting corporation will reduce its proposed Grant-in-Aid by  250,000 to  5,080,000, and will entail: -(a) Reducing the Latin American Services from 3\ to \\ hours a day, inBrazilian-Portuguese, and from 5f to 3 hours in Spanish, i.e., a pro-gramme of 1J hours repeated twice in order to cover time differencesacross the continent.(b) Abolition of broadcasts in ali but the most widely known languages ofIndia, Ceylon and Pakistan.(c) Abandonment of the purchase of time on Radio Ceylon for relayingprogrammes to the Far East.(d) Cancellation of programmes in Afrikaans.11. The British Council&apos;s proposed expenditure will be reduced by  269,000to  3,032,000. This will mean:(a) Saving  50,000 in Latin America while stopping short of throwing awaycompletely the position built up over the last ten years. The Council&apos;scultural activities would be supplied by such talent as its local staffmay possess.(b) Saving  30,000 in Europe by reducing staff and activities in France Portugal,Denmark, The Netherlands (all N.A.T.O. countries), Sweden and turkey.*     (c) Closing the Institute a gift from the Emperor at Addis Ababa, and reducing staff in Egypt by  10,000.(d) Saving  40,000 in the United Kingdom by economies at headquarters andclosing centres in various university towns and other cities where over-seas students congregate, in particular at Stratford-upon-Avon.(e) Abandoning plans to appoint representatives in Canada and South Africa;reduction of activities in India, Pakistan and Australia.(/) Closing down in some colonies and reducing important work in others.(g) Saving  74,000 by miscellaneous cuts at home and overseas, chiefly in thefield of music, drama and the fine arts.12. In our determined effort to help the Chancellor, we have taken theresponsibility of proposing all the above-mentioned serious reductions of our work.We think, therefore, that we can reasonably ask the Cabinet to accept ourassurance that nothing which could be described as unnecessary has been allowedto remain in the Estimates. The figure of  900,000 was reached after muchthought, and represents the limit to which, in our considered opinion, we could go without grave damage to the national interest.13. The figure now proposed by the Chancellor would require a further saving of  650,000 next year. This would have the following consequences, among others: - -(i) The British Broadcasting Corporation would have to save a further 430,000.  This would mean-fa) Abandonment of provision for measures to be taken if broadcaststo satellite countries were jammed on the Russian pattern. Thismeans that if jamming were to start, these services, which are our only means of reaching the populations of those countries, wouldhave to be given up.(b) Abandonment of plans for the improvement of the Far Easternservice, including, for instance, an urgently needed service inVietnamese for Indo-China.
(c) Abandonment of plans for the improvement and extension of theArabic service.(d) The complete aband nment of mid-day transmissions to Europeincluding Polish,   ilgarian, Czech and Yugoslav.:    (e) The reduction of the French and English services to Europe from-  to 2\ hours to \\ hours a day each, and of the Germanservice from A\ to 2\ hours.(/) Abolition of services for Belgium, Portugal, Denmark (all N.A.T.O......: f countries) and Austria, and reduction of all other Europeanservices except G rman to a maximum of \\ hours a day.(ii) The British Council would have to save a further  382,000 next year.(a) Additional sacrifices would involve such further measures as complete withdrawal from Latin America, China, Poland, and switzerland, New Zealand and some colonies; considerable further cuts in India and Pakistan, France, Italy, Portugal,Turkey, The Netherlands, -Sweden and Australia; considerable further reductions in the United Kingdom; reduction of some 120,000 in cultural and scientific activities.(b) A sudden contraction of activity of this kind of scale following as.it would on successive contractions in the past three years, would leave the impression both in the countries where the cuts weremade and among the staff of the Council and upon its executivecommittee (which has already approached the Prime Minister onthe subject) that His Majesty&apos;s Government attach little value toeducational and cultural work.J.
