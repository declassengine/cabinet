SECRETNOTECP,(51) 49The attached memorandum willbe considered at the meeting of theCabinet on Monday, 12th February, 1951,at 1 0. 0 a, m.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9TH FEBRUARY, 1951.
HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(51) 49 COPY NO.319TH FEBRUARY, 1951CABINETCALL-UP OF AGRICULTURAL workers memorandum by the Minister of Labour and national service in accordance with the Prime Minister&apos;s instructions (C.P.(51) 36,paragraph 3), I have discussed with the Minister of Defence, the Minister ofAgriculture, the Secretary of State for War and the Joint parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Scotland, the detailed measures for imple-menting the Cabinet&apos;s decision to discontinue the policy of deferring the call-up of agricultural workers for national service (C.M.(51) 8th Conclu-sions, Minute 2).     The outstanding questions and the conclusions reached on them are as follows.2. The first question is whether it would be possible not to startcalling up agricultural workers until after this year&apos;s harvest.     Thearguments in favour of this are partly psychological - that this concession would soften this blow for the farmers - and partly that there may be aconsiderable loss to food production if these men are not left with the farmers until after the harvest.     Farmers are now making their croppingplans for the year and will not sow crops if they foresee difficulty aboutharvesting them.     This applies particularly to the potato harvest whichimposes the heaviest strain on the labour force of the farmers and does notstart until October.Against this, on present indications, it will not be possible to findmore than 179,000 National Service men for the Forces this year againstthe figure of about 204,000 the Services would like to have.     If the calling up of agricultural workers did not start until October or November, thefortnightly intake to the Army, which is at present 5,200, would drop toabout 5,150 from April onwards and then go up to 5,750 when the calling upof agricultural workers started.     The Minister of Defence and the Secretaryof State for War are not prepared to accept this.    Apart from the fact thatthe strength both ofthe active Army and of the reserve Army must be built up as quickly as possible to meet the danger period in the next two or threeyears, the drop in the intake and subsequent increase creates serious difficulties from the standpoint of the training organisation.It would, however, be possible not to start calling up young menfrom the farms until May so as to leave the farmers with their full labour force to complete the planting of the potato and other crops.     Men could then be called up during May, June and July and call-up suspended thereafteruntil after October in order to leave the full labour force on the farms for both the corn and potato harvests.
The Agricultural Ministers agreed that this arrangement would help with the worst problems, but the Minister of Agriculture wished to reserve his position.     I should point out that the number of men whowould be called up during May, June and July would be only between 3,000and 4,000 out of about 650,000 regular workers on the farms.     Includingthe farmers themselves the number is nearly 1,000,000.3. The second point is that the Cabinet decided that special care should be taken to ensure that the Hardship Tribunals safeguarded theposition of the small farmer with one or two workers.    In fact, it wouldnot be possible to secure this in-this way as these Committees are inde-pendent statutory bodies.     I am. however, prepared to arrange for casesof this kind to be dealt with administratively.     Farmers employing onlyone or two workers would apply to ray Department locally for the defermentof a man&apos;s calling up for a period to allow adjustments to be made.     such applications would be granted where it was clear that immediate calling upwould lead to a substantial fall in food production and would not be refusedwithout consultation with the County War Agricultural Committee or other appropriate body representing agricultural interests.     Applications forrenewal of deferment would be considered.     Cases which could not besettled locally would be referred to Headquarters.The number of cases in which deferment would, in fact, be granted under these arrangements can, of course, only be guessed.     It is, however,my view that the cases should be strictly limited to those arising on smallfarms or smallholdings employing not more than two workers and makinga real contribution to food production in which a substantial drop, in! fpodproduction would inevitably result from the man&apos;s immediate calling up,because,, for example, the farm was in a remote district or there were nomembers of the farmerrs family who could give additional help.     I shouldnot expect that there would be more than a few hundred of such cases.The Minister of Agriculture, on the other hand, points out that roughly150,000 agricultural workers are employed on farms employing one or twoworkers^     On an average distribution, about 4,000 of the young men who,allowing for medical rejections, would be due for call-up in any year would come from these farms and he thinks that most of them would deservedeferment.     Indeed, he takes the view that deferment on these lines should operate over the whole field of agriculture without restriction to farmsemploying one or two workers.     The Minister of Defence and I are unableto accept this contention.     If cases were looked at individually before menwere called up from agriculture, which admittedly is not at the momentshort of labour, how would it be possible to resist pressure to makecorresponding arrangements in the case of every other industry, many ofwhich are, in fact, very short of labour?4. The third point is the timing of the announcement.     The Ministerof Agriculture would like this to be deferred for a few weeks in order togive him time to consult the National Farmers&apos; Union.     I do not think itis possible to avoid announcing this change in the course of the debate on defence next Wednesday and Thursday though, in order to give the Ministerof Agriculture a little more time in which to see the National Farmers&apos;Union, it would, I think, be possible to defer the announcement until thewinding up speech which I am to make on Thursday evening.     Apart fromthis, if the first young men are to be called up from agriculture at thebeginning of May, it seems to me that, in fairness to the young men them-selves as well as to the farmers, the sooner we make the announcementthe better.A.B.Ministry of Labour and National Service,   S.W.1,9TH FEBRUARY, 1951.
