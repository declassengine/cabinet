DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(51) 33 COPY NO.26TH JANUARY, 1951CABINETPROPOSED FOUR-POWER MEETINGMemorandum by the minister of StateMy colleagues will have followed from the telegrams the develop-ment of the discussions with the French and United States Governments onthis &apos;subject since it was considered by the Cabinet on 5th December(CM.(50) 82nd Conclusions, Minute 2).     They will be aware that these discussions have resulted in the communication by the three western powers of Notes on 22nd December in reply to the Soviet Note of 3rdNovember, and, on 23rd January, of further replies to the Soviet rejoinder.2. The main difference which these exchanges have so far revealedbetween the Soviet Union and the three &quot;Western Powers related to thescope of the proposed talks.     The Soviet Government began by proposing that a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers should be held to dis-cuss the demilitarisation of Germany and later agreed that it should dis-cuss in addition other German problems.     The Western Powers, on theother hand, have insisted that a meeting of the four Foreign Ministersmust, if it is to make a real contribution to peace, deal not only with questions relating to Germany but also with the question of the Austrian treaty and the &quot;principal problems whose solution would make possible a real and lasting improvement in the relations&quot; between the four countries and &quot;the elimination of the causes of present international tension throughout the world&quot;.     The Soviet Government do not reject theproposal for a preliminary meeting of representatives of the four Govern-ments to recommend an agenda for the meeting of Ministers, but they havenot revealed whether they are ready to discuss questions other than Germanquestions.     It was the object of the latest Note of the three Western Powersto elicit whether the Soviet Government were in fact willing to agree thatthe representatives of the four Governments should meet to draw up an agenda on this wider basis.3. It is possible that the Soviet Government may very shortly replyto this latest Note.     The United States Government are accordingly urging that a preliminary meeting of official representatives of the three western powers should take place in Washington without delay in order to seek agreement upon a common line to be pursued by the three Western powers in the preliminary four-Power discussions,     When the Cabinet discussed this matter on 5th December they considered that, in view of the conversa-tions then being held by the Prime Minister in Washington, the meeting of officials of the three Powers which at that time was about to be held inParis should be limited to the preparation of a draft reply to the SovietGovernment and should not deal with the substance of the problems to bediscussed in any four-Power meeting.     I consider that the time has now come when it is desirable that some such preliminary discussion of sub-stance should take place and I have agreed to authorise H.M. Ambassador
at Washington, assisted by a representative of the Foreign Office, toparticipate in such discussions in the course of the coming week.     Itwill, of course, be for the three Governments to approve any recommenda-tions that may be made at this meeting.4. I now circulate for the consideration of my colleagues twopapers which have been prepared in the Foreign Office for the guidanceof H.M. Ambassador in these discussions.     The first of these papers(Annex A) argues that in spite of the.attractions which a settlementrelated to Germany alone might appear to have to opinion in this countryand in France, we could not afford to accept it if it were such as might result in the establishment of a neutral and demilitarised Germany liableto fall a prey to the Communists;   and that accordingly we should adhere to the position hitherto adopted that any meeting of Ministers must, dealalso with other problems.     The second paper (Annex B) seeks to identifythese other problems and to decide which of them we should propose tohave placed upon the agenda of the four-Power talks.5. In C.P.(50) 294, which was discussed at the Cabinet meeting on 5th December, there was suggested a possible agenda for four-power talks such as might lead to a world-wide settlement.     It will be seen from Annex B to the present paper that I now propose a more limitedagenda.     In the first place, Far Eastern questions are being handledelsewhere.     In the second, I feel that to insist on discussing all questions at issue with the Soviet Government might give to public opinion theimpression that we were asking for the moon and were not serious in our intentions.     It accordingly seems better to seek to limit the agenda to thematters whose settlement we consider really essential.6. There is little doubt that our first and principal aim should be tosecure a genuine reduction of Soviet and satellite armaments.     The realcauses of internatinal tension are Communist acts of interference andaggression supported by the excessive armed forces of the Soviet andsatellite States.     Any settlement which did not bring about a reduction ofthose forces would not remove the real causes of tension and would thus,in my view, be a snare and a delusion.     On the other hand, if such areduction were secured many subsidiary difficulties would disappear.     Ihave accordingly proposed that the first item on our agenda should be adisarmament pact and that the question of the demilitarisation of germany should be coupled with, and only be discussed in connection with, this item.7. As the second item on the agenda we could then propose thecreation of a free and unified Germany, in regard to which we made proposals to the Russians last May.     As the third, the conclusion of anAustrian Treaty, which is a matter already in the hands of the Council ofForeign Ministers and must accordingly, in my view, figure in any attemptto reach a settlement.     The fourth item &quot;The elimination of hostile andsubversive propaganda&quot; seems to me so eminently desirable that we must seek to secure its inclusion in any agenda, while recognising that even if agreement were reached on paper with the Soviet Government on thismatter any assurances we received from them would be likely to have little value in practice.     The fifth item &quot;The conclusion of a non-aggression pact&quot; also presents difficulties.     But such an item should, inmy view, form a natural part of any attempt to reach a genuine settlement and though, of course, it would only come to fruition as part of such asettlement, its proposal by the Western Powers would indicate theirsincere desire for peace and the fact that they have no aggressive inten-tions towards the Soviet Union.
8, I would reiterate that it is in my view most important that,desirable though it is to lose no opportunity of reaching an agreementwith the Soviet Union and of reducing the causes of tension in the world,we should resist the temptation to enter into discussion with the Russiansthat would be limited to German questions alone even with the additionof the Austrian Treaty question.     I believe that any German settlement which the Russians will accept would involve the risk of the whole ofGermany falling into the hands of the Communists.     It would, moreover,oblige us to renounce our plans for German co-operation in the defenceof the West without removing the fundamental causes of the presenttension and the real threat to our security.     To enter into discussions with the Russians on the basis of Germany (and Austria) alone would thusplace us before the alternatives of accepting a settlement which, I believe,would expose this country to serious dangers, or of rejecting it and ofthereby appearing to reject a reasonable opportunity of reducing worldtension.     It would also, of course, mean departing from the attitude takenin common with the French and United States Governments in the presentexchange of correspondence with the Soviet Government.     Such a depart-ure might not be without serious consequences for our relations with theUnited States having regard to our existing differences with the UnitedStates Government in the Far East.9. I accordingly seek the approval of my colleagues for the twopapers at Annex A and Annex B as guidance for H&apos;.M. Ambassador atWashington in the proposed preliminary and exploratory discussions with representatives of the French and United States Governments,K.G.Y.Foreign Office, S.W.1,26TH JANUARY, 1951.
AfflTEX  fAfF OUR-P OVilER TALKS -&quot;   &apos; THE GERMAN&apos; PROBLEM.The aim of Soviet policy towards Germany is to ensure so far aspossible that Germany shall not herself be, nor be used by other powers as, a threat to the Soviet Union.    To this end the soviet union would hope to secure control of German policies and resources and to deny such control to other Powers.2.     After the war the Soviet Union was able successfully to carryout such a policy in the countries of Eastern Europe which she alone   -liberated or occupied.    In the case of Germany, not-being the soleoccupying power,  she had to agree at Potsdam to a compromise,  in thehope that the four-Power control machinery would provide her with anindirect means of achieving the same end.    When she saw that thiswas not to be,  she concentrated successfully on making the SovietZone alone completely subservient to her interests.3.     But there is no reason to suppose that her long-term aim has changed.    She still hopes to gain effective control&quot;of the whole ofGermany,   including especially the Ruhr,  through the concentration cfpower&apos; in trusted German Communist hands.    It is unlikely that,  asa long-term policy,  she would accept anything that fell substantiallyshort of this objective.    But she may continue to recognise that she must approach it by easy stages.    There is no evidence that at presentshe wishes to go to war to achieve her aim.   Indeed,   if the soviet union were tempted to resort to force,   it would most probably be withthe object of preventing or warding off the possibility of a latermove by a rearmed Germany to recover her eastern territories.    Butthis does not mean that we can exclude the possibility that russia would be prepared to risk war to forestall any development likely to preclude her permanently from getting control over the whole ofGermany.    She is certain to use all methods short of war to prevent such developments&apos;.U.      Such a development would be the arming of the German federal republic by the Western Powers  in such a manner as would ensure not   1only that the Republic was firmly    and irrevocably bound to the Westbut also that it was made defensible against armed attack or subversiveinfiltration from the East.    The Russians will probably calculate,  quitcorrectly,  that there  is no likelihood of that position being reachedovernight and that they can therefore afford to take time with theircounter-measures and need not have recourse to immediate action.Nevertheless,  they can be relied upon to make strenuous efforts to stop the process of German rearmament before it gets too far advancedand they may be prepared to make substantial tactical concessions,to achieve this.    They would make such concessions, not because theyhad given up their long-term objective, but rather in order to preserve the possibility of its&quot;ultimate achievement.5.      The problem therefore is to consider what offers the SovietGovernment might make to this end in a Council of Foreign ministers and what our attitude should be towards such offers.Return to Potsdam6.      The Russians might suggest that they would be prepared to treatGermany as a political&quot; and economic unit and to cooperate in workingthe Four-Power Control Machinery as provided for. in the PotsdamAgreement&apos;on condition that the Western&apos; Powers agreed, to carry out infull all the provisions of that agreement,   including in particular the !demilitarisation and disarmament provisions.7.      Our answer tc this would be that a return to
on agreement designed to cover the initial control period only,and which proved &apos; .uhworkablo even then, would he impossibly retrogradeat this stage when so much progress has &quot;boon made in West Germany, -and even to some, extent in- the 3 yiot Z,no, in handing over powerto German authorities, whose wishes cannot be ignored.Prague Proposals        .: -8.      It is mare, likely that the Russians would take their standon the proposals Tnade nn 21st October., 1950, at the end of theconference held, in Praguerepresenting them as being based uponPotsdam but with modifications designed to take account of thepresent situation. .9.      Our reply w...uld be that the Prague proposals have been rejected as unacceptable by all responsible leaders  of opinion in west germany;  that before these prop -sals could have any reality it wouldbe necessary for the Soviet Government, to disband the Germanmilitarised units in toe East Zone and to cease exploiting the LestGerman econ ,myj    and that in any event we could not agree to theprinciple of equal representation for the Communist regime in eastern Germany and for too freely-elected Government of the PeoeralRepublic.Western Powers Proposals10.    It is possible that, faced with the pr babllity of a refusal to c .nelder the Prague pr.;p.sals, the Soviet    Eovornment might thinkit worth their while to offer- to modi fy them so as to make themoppear more like toe proposals which the Western Powers have hithertosupported.    They might even offer to accept those proposals.These proposals were agreed upon last May and later communicated tothe Soviet authorities in Germany,11.    Too essence  of trie Vvestern proposals is chat they constitute apr gressive programme for the restoration of Gorman unity.    First,toe four occupying Powers must reach agreement on an all-Germanelectoral law&quot; based upon recognised principles of individualfreedom ana constitutional rights.    Toon an all-German Asseoibly,freely chosen in accordance with this s law, must draw up a constitution for a unified   Germany,  which shall nmd be    submitter to the German .people f r ratification,   thereafter,  provision having meanwhilebeen made far the prohibition   .f secret and para-military police,for measures t... ensure German economic unity, for toe surrender of soviet-controlled industrial enterprises and for the establishmentof quadrioartito su oervi si on ,. an all-German G vernment would be formed.    Finally,  the four Powers would address themselves to a peace  settlement.12.    Nothing is said in toese proposals about too withdrawalof occupation troops, that being reggrded. as a matter to be dealtwith in the eventual peace -settlement.

It is more likely that the Russians would take their standon the proposals mode on 21st Oct. ber, 1950, at the end of theconference no Id. in Prague, representing them as being based uponPotsdam but with modifications designed t.:  take account of tnepresent situation. -9.      Our reply would be that the Prague proposals have been rejected as unacceptable by all responsible leaders  of opinion in west germany;  that before these prop sals could hove any reality it wouldbe necessary for tho Soviet Government, to disband the Germa imilitarised units in the East Zone and to cease exploiting the &amp;sstGerman economy;    end that in any event we could not agree to theprinciple of equol representoti n for tho Communist regime in eastern Germany and for the frcoly-olectcd Government of the FeoeralRepubli c.Western Powers Pr,posnls10.    It is possible that, faced with the probability of a refusal to c.nsidcr the Prague proposals, the Soviet    Foyornment might thinkit w.:rth their while to offer loo ... .di fy the la so as to make them,appear more like too proposals which the Western Powers have hithertosupported.   They might even&apos; offer to accept those proposals.These proposals were agreed upon last May and later communicated tothe Soviet authorities in Germany.11.    The essence ;f tne Western proposals is that they constitute a progressive programme for too restoration of German unity.    First,toe four occupying P wers must roach agreement on on all-Germanelectoral law based upon recognised principles of individualfreedom and constitutional rights.    Toon an all-German Assembly,freely chosen in accordance with this a lew, -oust or aw up a constitution for a unified   Germany, which shall next be    submitter to the Germanpeople f r ratification.   .Thereafter;  or,.vision having meanwhilebeen made far the prohibition   . f secret and para-ui li cary o.licc,for measures t... ensure German ioc.on_.nie unity,  for toe surrender ^fSoviet-controlled industrial enterprises and for tho establishmentof quadripartite supervision,, on all-German G vornment would be formed.    Finally,  the four Powers \v.;ula address themselves to a peace settlement.12.    Nothing is said in tooso proposals about toe withdrawal.: f occupation troops, that being regarded, as a^ matter to be dealtwith in the eventual peace settlement.    Since the programme would clearly take a long time to carry through, the western proposalsavoid the danger of our finding -ourselves faced in tho immediatefuture with tne necessity of withdrawin   all K. AWT. 0. t re troops fromGermany while the Soviet forces withdrew to Poland.13.    To any that it is not now opportune to carry  .ut our Maypr-griimc, toxo back    n our offer t.  promote the unity of Germanyind to   work f-r the creation of a free all-German Government andfor-the conclusion of a peace treaty, migrio nave
.grave effects on opinion in Western Germany besides exposing us&quot;to&quot;damaging Communist propaganda.   We should be well-advised to avoid&apos;giving any impression that we had abandoned our idea of eventuallycreating a--united Germany which would be free and linked to the West.It jds therefore better that we should agree to embark on the Maym*gramme- &quot;should the Russians show willingness to do so.    Even if agreement $ould be reached on an electoral law far Germany and on an^all-German constitution and if an all-German Government were formed;this would take much time and the question of the withdrawal of troops would be left to be dealt with at or after-the negotiation of the subsequent peace settlement in the light of the si-situation then existing.It would also have to be made clear to the Soviet Government that theall-German Government, when formed must be free to enter into politicaland economic relations with any Power or Group of Powers of her choice.(If discussions were opened with the Russians for such a    settlementwe should endeavour at the same time to secure agreement on the Austrian treaty.)14.    The great difficulty is likely to arise over the question of german rearmament.    The Russians will almost certainly make it a condition oftheir acceptance of our proposals for the unification of Germany thatthe Western P-wwers, for their part, &quot;should agree to cancel all plans for mobilising German-manpower and industry for defence purposes.15.    Acceptance ,of this condition would,  in present circumstances, involvethe gravest risks.    The proposals for German unity made by the thr-eWestern Givernments last May were no diubt put forward f*r propagandareasons rather than with any real expectation that they ^//ould be acceptedby the Soviet Government.    The Western Powers recognised the advantages of a settlement of the German question which would remove what has beensingle the war,  the greatest single cause of tension in the world, wouldrestore -German unity, solve the Berlin question, bring about thewithdrawal of^Soviet troops and control in Germany (and Austria) andunite 20 million Germans (and Austrians) with the West under freeGovernments of.their own choice.    But they realised that any settlement which involved the neutralisation of Germany was open to serious objections.    In the first place, an apparent settlement-of the Germanquestion&quot;&apos; might well render it difficult to retain popular support in western Europe for the continuation of an active rearmament programmesuch as will remain essential until a general settlement with Russiahas been secured.    There might well be a corresponding weakening of american interest in Europe, and it would be difficult to maintain the impetus behind the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.    The opportunityof securing the use of German territory, manpower and resources to ensure&quot;the effective defence of the West would be lost.    Allied troops wouldhave to be withdrawn from Germany and, even if U.S.  troops were not withdrawn from Europe altogether, the arrangements that would have to)te made to station them in Prance and the Low Countries would give rise&apos;** very serious political and psychological difficulties.    The unilaterallyimposed demilitarisation and defencelessness of Germany&apos;might, in thelong run, become unpopular and difficult to enforce,in that country.    TheSoviet Union, protected by a neutral Germany, would be;left;free to pursue her aggressive policy in other parts of the world until ready to turn West
again.     Finally,  the struggle between East and West for the possession of an unarmed Germany would at once begin, with the&quot;grave risk that, with the West lulled into a false feeling of relief, the whole of Germany, would fall into the hands of the communists as Hungary and Czechoslovakia fell in the -oast.The fact that this struggle will inevitably begin alonesuffices to show that even a German settlement on our terms would not in fact remove causes of tension with Russia in central Europe.16.      Moreover,  today, when the actions of the Soviet Governmentand of their allies have so blatantly revealed -the aggressivenature of their -policies,  the risks involved in leavingWestern Germany undefended are more evident than -ever.      Toagree to cancel our -clans for rearming Germany as a condition for Soviet acceptance of our proposals for the reunion ofGermany would mean not only that the Russians had secured their immediate objective of preventing a German contribution to western defence, but also that they had brought nearer the achievement of their main objective of eventually securingcontrol over the whole of Germany.      Not only would the western defence effort itself be seriously weakened,  if not renderedineffective, but the Western Towers would be much less ableto resist other Soviet demands,  such,  for instance,  as demands for the withdrawal of American forces from the Continent or forthe disolution of the Atlantic Treaty.17.      The Western Powers can in fact only afford an agreement onthese lines,  i.e.  Soviet acceptance of the Western programme for German unity against a Western undertaking not to -proceedwith German rearmament, provided the Soviet Government areprepared to change their policy of threats,  subversion andaggression and to agree to a fair and watertight plan for thereduction and control &quot;of armaments.      There is no half-wayhouse.     Attractive though it is to envisage a partial settlemewhich would serve to reduce tension or to remove some of thepossible causes of war, the fact is that any settlement in.Europe that did not provide either for the withdrawal of Sivietcontrol over the satellite States or for the reduction of soviet and satellite armed forces would be a snare and adelusion.      It is vain to imagine that the Soviet Governmentwould agree to either of these courses at the present time,  andthe conclusion to which we are forces is,., therefore, that nosettlement is today attainable which would justify theabandonment of our -plans for incorporating the Federal Republicin the defence of the West.18.      At the same time we must carefully weigh   the consequenceof&apos;rejecting a Soviet offer of the. sort described at thebeginning of the preceding paragraph.      In the first place,  todo0so might well create serious difficulties for us in germany in view of German reluctance to see the Federal Republicrearmed and German attachment to the unity of their country.Secondly, public opinion in the countries of the West wouldhave to be convinced that a partial settlement was worse thannone at all.      Thirdly, we must give full weight to thewarnings given by the Soviet Government regarding the effectof the rearmament of Germany.      On 20th October the bovietGovernment stated that they will &quot;not reconcile themselves to measures directed towards the restoration in Western-k-
Germany of a    German regular army&quot;.    On 15th December they statedthat the &quot;preparation&apos;of a direct military alliance with theGovernment of Adenauer&quot; is creating &quot;a serious threat to peace&quot;,that &quot;to follow this course is to forget the lessons of the recentpast ...  and. to strive for the&apos;revival of   Ggrman^militari sm, , Withthis the Soviet Union cannot reconcile itself.11    On jlst Decemberthey informed us that they regard the question of the demilitarisationof Germany &quot;as most important for    ensuring international peace&quot;.These statements were undoubtedly made with the object of inducingthe Western Powers    to abandon their    plans for rearming Germany.But the possibility - cannot be excluded that the Soviet Union willforce war upon us rather than see the manpower and industrial resources of Western Germany harnessed into the military effort ofthe Atlantic powers.Conelusi ens19.      The conclusions to be drawn from the above are as fellows.First, we should be ready to embark upon discussions with theRussians for the purpose of carrying out the proposals the western powers made last May for the reunification of Germany (see paragraph13 above) and for the creation of an all-German Government free toenter into political and economic relations with other Powers,  andfor the completion of the Austrian Treaty.    But if, as is almost certain,  the Russians cuplo an offer to discuss our proposals aboutGermany with the condition that Germany shall remain demilitarised,we should adhere fto the line taken in our Note of 22nd December tothe Soviet Government.    This was to the effect that  our defensive measures j including our plans fo.r the participation of   German units in the defence of western Germany, are solely the result of soviet policy and actions, and that no real reduction of tension and nolasting settlement is possible unless&apos; it deals with the general attitude adopted by the Soviet Government since the end of the war andwith the consequent international developments of recent, months.    Weshould therefore insist that the German (and Austrian)  questions canonly be settled as part of a settlement of &quot;the principal problemswhose solution would make possible a real and lasting improvement inIf1!!!^ wluie!uidmaintain our readiness to discuss these problems in accordance withthe Iraqi -Syrian resolution.    In the meanwhilewe should proceed asactively as possible with bui Iding up the defensive strength-of theN.A.T.O. Powers and continue   our discussions with the federal government,
-  mANNEX   1B1FOUR-POWER TnLKS    -    PRELIMINARY TRIPARTITECONSULTATIONSIn the paper on the German problem at the four-Power talks (Annex A), it was argued that, in spite ofthe attractions which a German settlement would in facthave and would appear to have to opinion here and in France,we could not afford to accept it,  if it were such as might result in the establishment of a neutral and demilitarisedGermany liable to fall a prey to the Communists.    It was argued that, if we agreed to discussions with the Russians   -only on German (and Austrian)  questions, we should put ourselves in the position of having either to acceptthe demilitarisation of Germany with all its conse-quences, or to reject it thereby publicly disowningthe undertakings we gave at Potsdam and rejectingwhat might appear to be a reasonable offer to solve the German problem.    However desirable it may be to avoidrefusing to talk to the Russians, it is therefore essentialthat we should only agree to discuss German demilitarisationtogether with the real causes of tension in the world.    Forthis reason we told the Russians on the 22nd December that themeeting of Ministers would have to cover the &quot;principal problems
whose solution would&apos;make possible a real-and lastingimprovement in the relations&quot; between the four countries.    Thequestion now is to identify those problems and to decide which of them we want &quot;to put on the agenda of the four-Power talks.2,.  .   In an earlier examination of the problems outstandingbetween ourselves and the Russians we summarised the major issues as follows;-(l) Implementation  of the Balkan Peace Treaties and agreement on means whereby all countries shall been abled to have the government of their own freely-expressed choice.(2)  (a) Agreement on freedom of access  to each other&apos;scountries and on freedom of exchange of information and cultural matter.(b) Agreement to eliminate  hostile- and subversivepr op agenda.(c) Agreement on measures  to promote  economic relations despite differences of politicalsystems.(3)  Agreement under  the United Nations on effective plans for the international control  of atomic energy and major offensive weapons of war and for the reductionof conventional armaments.(h)   (a)  Settlement of outstanding issues on the AustrianTr e a ty.(b) Agreement on a plan for restoring German unity and concluding a German Peace Treaty.(5)  Agreement on the use of veto in the United Nations,
respect for the rule of law and for recognisedf orm s of i n t er n a ti on a 1 c on due t.3,      This list excluded Far Eastern items, first because theywere being handled elsewhere,  and, secondly, because even an acceptable settlement in. the Ear East, which was unaccompaniedby the cessation of Communist intrigue end by a reduction of communist forces, would not justify our abandoning the measureswe contemplate for our defence in Europe.1+,      The difficulty about the above list,  considered as-a planor as an agenda,  is  that it is loose and woolly.    If we put itforward as an agenda the Russians would, twist and turn it intheir favour end there is a serious danger that if we startedfrom such a basis we should find  ourselves ending up by takingconcrete action,  such as the cessation of German rearmament,  in -return for  empty premises.    At- the best,  this would mean thatthe rearmament of Germany was postponed far a few months,  that is,until we saw that the Russians had no intention of carrying out their undertakings;  but it is far more likely that the Sovietevasion would be sufficiently subtle  to make it difficult forus to resume our German programme for a long period.5,      We must therefore ensure that if the Russians wish to buy the demilitarisation of Germany,   they shall buy it at the priceof specific and concrete actions which will remove  or greatlylessen the threat to the West.g       What sort of actions would suffice?    The French, webelieve, may consider that a German settlement, which providedfor the establishment cf a *uni ted and neutral Germany, wouldnot only be acceptable as bringing about a relaxation  of tension.,but would be desirable in itself.    They are therefore toyingwith the idea that a sufficient price for German demilitarisation
would be a political settlement in Germany reuglily on thelines of our May, 1950, proposals- (free elections and unity),together, perhaps, with an agreement on the implementation of-the Satellite Peace Treaties.7.      Our view, is&apos; that neither  this nor any similar solution is acceptable-.    Such solutions leave untouched the real causes of tension which are, as stated above, Communist acts of inter-ference and aggression, supported- by the excessive -armed forces of the Soviet and Satellite States,    Thus,   any settlement which does net bring- about a reduction of those forces wouldnot remove the real causes of tension ond would be  a snare  anda delusi m.8.      The conclusion is  therefore that,  if we are t o refrain .from rearming Germany,  the first and principal element in ourprice must be a genuine reducti-n   f Soviet and satellitearmaments.    This would have t o be-coupled with sane,  though not a proportional, reduction cf cur own conventionalarmaments and agreement on the c lotr-ol of atomic weapons.    Anydisarmament agreement to be acceptable to us must be fair andwatertight, but, unless we get such an agreement,   any othersolutions of individual problems will not be worth the paperthey are written on.    Any relaxation  of ten si on to- which suchsolutions might appear.to lead w uld be as unreal as was the&quot;p eac e&quot; w on a t Muni c h in 1938.9.      What further items  ought we to include in cur agenda?There is a temptation to &quot;put in  other desiderata as well,  sothat our  agenda will look like a blue-print for &amp; world-widesettlement.    This would we consider, be inadvisable, sincepublic   opinion in Western countries, would regard stach an agenda as asking for the moon and would assume that f-ve werenot serious.    It will be better to keep  the agenda doWji/to-k-
the things that matter. If these can be settled the other points will present little difficulty; if they cannot, tosettle minor points will not help.10.    We have there-fare not specifically proposed the inclusionof the question of the Satellite Peace Treaties.    It is vain torequire the Russians to implement Yalta and to replaceKing Michael and M. Mikolajczyk.    What we shall  have to requireis that the satellite forces be reduced to their Peace Treatylimits.    This will be covered by the item on disarmament.    TheRussians,  in return,  would insist on the execution of theItalian Peace Treaty,  both in regard to&apos; the armed forces and inTrieste.    They will anyhow raise the Trieste question inconnexion with the Austrian Treaty.11,    The second item might aim at the implementation if a western programme for a free and unified Germany leading up toa Peace Treaty.    Next,  it is suggested, should come an itemproviding for the conclusion of an Austrian Treaty.    The nextitem might be an agreement to eliminate hostile  and subversivepropaganda coupled,  possibly, with the dissoluti on  of the Sovietinstrument f r such propaganda - the Ceminfcrm.    Finally, we might  offer the Russians a non-aggressive pact.    The drafting ofsuch instruments is always difficult and they are liable to prove double-edged weapons,  but we can safeguard ourselves onthis point by providing that the non-aggression pact shall onlycome into force  on the c conclusion   :f a disarmament agreement.12.      Our agenda will therefore read as follows(l)    A Disarmament Pact and the question of the demilitarisation   .:f Germany..(2)    The creation  of a free  and unified Germany.(3)    The c ;nclusi on   :f an Austrian Treaty.(U)    The elimination   f hostile one! subversivepropaganda.
(5) The conclusion of a non-aggressi n pact to come intoeffect on the exclusion of a disarmament agreement.13.    We should make it clear to cur Allies,  and equally clear to the Russians at an appropriate stage,  that the disarmamentpact is the critical point and that all other agreements are dependent upon it.    The disarmament pact itself should helaid cut in phases,  with prcvisi n for the other agreements(e.g. German demilitarisation) coming into force  only on completion   :f a large slice of Communist disarmament,ll+i    We recognise that the chances of the Russians acceptingsuch proposals are negligible. -   Our abject in drawing up theplan has been to avoid being drawn int:. the trap   -f a purelyGerman negotiation,  t,: confront the Russians with the real and net the pretended causes of world tension and to state cur casein a way which will win us the confident support of publicopinion in Western countries.15.    If the considerations   outlined ab vo are agreed., it isproposed that this paper and. the paper on Germany referred toin paragraph 2 sh uld form the basis   f the instructions  toour representatives at the f :rthcoming three-Power preparatorymeetings in &quot;Washington.
