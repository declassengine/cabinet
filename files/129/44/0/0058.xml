THIS  DOCUMENT IS THE  PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC  MAJESTYS  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. February 1951CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.CP. (51) 58list February, 1951CABINETUNIVERSITY EDUCATION IN DUNDEE AND ST. ANDREWSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i am circulating this paper, with the concurrence of the Lord President of theCouncil and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to let my colleagues know of theproposed appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into, and make recom-mendations for the solution of, the problem of university education in Dundee andits relationship with St. Andrews University.2. There has been a persistent difficulty in the relationship between theUniversity of St. Andrews and University College, Dundee, one of the constituent parts of the University, ever since 1897 when a union between the two was effected by an Ordinance made under the Universities (Scotland) Act, 1889. The root causeof the difficulty lies in the fact that the Ordinance left in being the deed of endow-ment and trust establishing the original governing bodies of University College,and failed to clarify the relations of these bodies with the University Court. Theresult is that University College, Dundee, is not fully under the control of theUniversity Court, but has a Council of its own which manages the finances of the college and appoints the Principal, while academic policy and appointments ofacademic staff are under the University Court.3. The fifty years of union have been characterised by a continuing state ofuneasy partnership, punctuated by periods of open conflict when the defectiveconstitutional machinery has proved unequal to the task of resolving differences ofoutlook and policy. Since the war, controversy has become increasingly acute.On the one hand, the University in St. Andrews in the last twenty years has expandedand prospered greatly, whereas no comparable development took place in university college, Dundee. On the other hand, the city of Dundee has, during and sincethe war, experienced an industrial revival from which has sprung a new civic prideand consciousness. In such an atmosphere, the inferior status of the College has given rise to feelings of frustration among those interested in the advance of univer-sity education in the city. This frustration has manifested itself in demands inUniversity and civil circles in Dundee for radical reform of the relationship betweenthe University institutions in the city and the University of St. Andrews. Thedifferent sections of opinion behind these demands vary from those who seekcomplete severance from St. Andrews and the establishment of a separate Universityin Dundee, which is strongly advocated by the local press and supported by theTown Council, to those who would retain the single University situated in bothSt. Andrews and Dundee, the whole under the University Court, but with an equalbalance between St. Andrews and Dundee preserved through the establishment of subordinate governing bodies with strictly defined functions, duties and jurisdictions.4. With the increasing bitterness in the controversy between the university and Dundee, both parties approached my predecessor with a view to securing somesettlement of the difficulties. In 1949 he appointed Lord Cooper, Lord Presidentof the Court of Session, with the assistance of two Assessors of experience anddistinction in University administration, to review the problem. The aim of this inquiry was to secure an independent and impartial appraisal of the position inthe hope that proposals would emerge on which it would be possible for the two sides to agree on joint action.   Lord Cooper&apos;s recommendations, which were40166
designed to effect a reconciliation, included the abolition of the separate governingbodies of University College^ Dundee, and of the collegiate system throughout theUniversity, and the subordination of the whole University, both in St. Andrewsand in Dundee, to a single and reformed University Court. Along with this consti-tutional reform, Lord Cooper recommended a reorientation of academic policy tosecure an integrated system of teaching in Dundee and St. Andrews.5. In the event, the two sides failed to agree on any basis of common actionto implement the recommendations in his report, and the situation has continuedto deteriorate. In these circumstances, the University Grants Committee visitedDundee and St. Andrews to obtain a complete picture of the problem as it nowexists and to ascertain the prospects of a more settled state of affairs. They regardwith the deepest concern the situation which they found. The Committee take theview that there is no prospect at all of any solution of the difficulties emerginglocally, and every prospect of an early and grave deterioration in the situation, whichthey think may soon be out of hand. With no settled academic policy to whichthey could give their approval, they regard it as impossible for them to reach decisions on the grants to be made available for St. Andrews University during theacademic quinquennium 1952-1957.6. As a consequence of their visit, the Committee have recommended that a royal Commission should be appointed as a necessary step towards ending thepresent impasse. The University Court have acted upon a suggestion made in thediscussions between the representatives of the University Grants Committee and theUniversity authorities that the University would be well advised to apply for theappointment of a Royal Commission, and have now addressed such an applicationto me. Proposals have also been made from time to time in the past on behalf ofthe Dundee interests for the setting up of a Royal Commission.7. The investigations of Lord Cooper and of the University Grants Committeehave shown that, as it stands, the constitution of University College is inherentlyunworkable, and that, in view of this and of the strong feeling which exists inDundee towards the development of university education generally in the city, stepsmust be taken to reform the present state of affairs. In the absence of any hope ofagreement among the parties on the measures necessary to achieve this reform, itis clear that the only remedy lies in legislation promoted by the Government. Itappears that there is no precedent for legislation to reform the constitution of a university except after investigation by a Royal Commission. In any case, thepresent controversy is so acute that it would be unwise for the Government to embark on legislation in connection with it without the support of recommendationsfrom a public inquiry of the most authoritative kind, as distinct from Lord Cooper&apos;sinvestigation which was of a more private and informal nature in the hope of solving the problem by mediation.8. I am therefore taking the necessary steps, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to implement the recommendation of the university grants Committee that a Royal Commission be appointed with the following termsof reference:  &quot; To inquire into the organisation of University education in Dundee, andits relationship with St. Andrews University, and to recommend what changes,if any, should be made in the constitution, functions and powers of theUniversity of St. Andrews, of University College, Dundee, or of any other bodyor institution concerned.&quot;I hope that Sir Geoffrey Heyworth will accept an invitation to act as Chairman.H. McN.Scottish Office, SWA,list February, 1951.
