J. 64JIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)74*SECRET32C.P.(51) 31 COPY NO.23RD JANUARY, 1951CABINETREPRESENTATION OF OTHER RANKS AT SERVICECOURTS-MARTIALMemorandum by the Minister of defence at the meeting of the Cabinet on 22nd January (CM. (51) 5thConclusions, Minute l), I was asked to circulate a further paper on the subjectof the representation of other ranks at Service courts-martial, giving such information as was available regarding the working of the United States system.2. This question was one of the matters dealt with at some length inthe Report of the Lewis Committee, the relevant paragraphs (227-?-40) ofwhich are annexed to this memorandum.   It will be seen that the lewis committee thought that the proposal should-stand or fall by three tests:(a) would it improve the quality of the court;(b) would it tend to improve the prospect, or the appearance, of justicebeing done;(c) would it tend to impair discipline.As to (a), their view was that commissioned officers are by education, training and experience best fitted to sit on courts-martial.   As to (b), the lewis committee thought that as nearly all officers now graduate from the ranks,there was little danger that they would not be familiar with conditions of life of other ranks.    Further, the Committee rightly pointed out that with regardto justice appearing to be done, this depends primarily on the conscientious .   -discharge of its duties by the court, and the rights and safeguards provided forthe accused, and not per se on the composition of the court.   As to (c), the lewis Committee pointed out that senior officers of the Army and Air Force were seriously perturbed by the proposal, which they thought might be very damaging to discipline.3. As the Cabinet know, one member of the Lewis Committee,Mr. A. R. Blackburn, M. P. , said in an addendum to the Report that whilesubscribing to it as a whole he did not agree with his colleagues on thisquestion of the representation of other ranks.    He argued that other ranksshould have the right to &quot;trial by their peers&quot; and made it clear that his proposal related to the Lewis Committee&apos;s recommendation that all verdictsshould be unanimous.    The Cabinet having decided against unanimous verdictsat courts-martial, Mr. Blackburn&apos;s main object of ensuring that an other rankshall not be convicted unless by the verdict of at least one other rank as wellas officers would not be achieved by granting representation of other rankson the court at the request of the accused.
4. The Pilcher Committee also considered this question(paragraph 60 of the First Pilcher Report).   They unanimously opposed it forthree reasons.    First, because it would give the court a representativecharacter,. unde undesirable in itself, and perhaps leading a court to rely on itsown members for expert advice instead of obtaining it from witnesses whoseevidence can be properly tested by cross-examination.   Secondly, they didnot think the inclusion of naval ratings would result in an improvement in theadministration of justice at courts-martial.    Thirdly, they thought it probablethat it would have an adverse effect upon discipline, and in particular that arating who had sat on a court might be in a most difficult position on the lowerdeck after the trial, whether it resulted in conviction or acquittal of the accused.5. The Napier Committee was also unanimously against the proposal that other ranks should sit as members of courts-martial.6. As I mention above, the Lewis Committee had been impressed bythe serious concern felt by senior officers who gave evidence to them aboutthe adverse effect on discipline which might result from this proposal.    TheBoard of Admiralty and the Army and Air Council have each considered thismatter, in their general review of the Pilcher and Lewis Reports.   The Boardof Admiralty fully endorsed the Pilcher recommendations and considered thatthe innovation of appointing naval ratings to courts-martial would be extremelyundesirable.    The Army Council considered the matter under my chairmanshipwhen I was Secretary of State for War in November, 1948, and we. e against mr.. Blackburn&apos;s proposal.   Subsequently, in July, 1950, they considered thematter, again with the same result, though I understand that the presentSecretary of State for War expressed his personal view in favour of other rankrepresentation.    The Air Council also, apart from the Secretary of State, were opposed to the proposal for representation of other ranks.   At the meetingon 18th July, 1950, between the Lord Chancellor, the Service Ministers, the attorney-General and myself, the majority of the Ministers present agreedthat other ranks should be excluded from courts-martial;  the Secretaries ofState for War and Air repeated their personal views in favour of other rankrepresentation but stated that they did not wish to press their views in-opposition to the majority of their colleagues.7. At the Cabinet discussion reference was made to the practice in the American Forces.    The Cabinet may be aware that the discipline codes ofthe American Forces were fused, by Act of Congress in may last year,into one Uniform Code of Military Justice applicable to all three AmericanServices, though it does not operate in the navy until next May.   Article 25 ofthis new Code provides that -&quot;Any enlisted person on active duty with the Armed forces who is not a member of the same unit as the accused shall be eligible to serve on general and special courts-martial for the trial of any enlisted person.....but he shall serve as a memberof a court only if.....the accused person has requested inwriting that enlisted persons serve on it.   After such a request, any enlisted person shall be tried by a general or special court-martial the membership of which does not exclude enlisted persons in a number comprising at least one-third of the total membership&quot;.8. It will be seen that the American practice is analogous to thefirst proposal which was before the Lewis Committee, and that other rankrepresentation is not, in terms, limited to non-commissioned officers.I understand, however, that in practice other rank members of a United States
court-martial are normally senior to the accused, and are usuallynominated by the formation convening the court from the rank of master&quot;sergeant or the equivalent.    From information furnished by the ThirdUnited States Air Division in this country it appears that on only two occasions out of 36 recent courts-martial of a standing equivalentto our general court-martial did the accused choose to have an other rankmember of the court, and similarly in 38 out of 134 special courts-martial(equivalent to our district court-martial).    I understand that on the wholerepresentation of other ranks at American courts-martial has tended to result in stiffer sentences, and that this has led to some falling off in thenumbers of accused seeking to avail themselves of this right.9. To sum up:   the JLewis Committee, with the exception ofMr. Blackburn, M. P. , were definitely against this proposal, as were thePilcher Committee unanimously.    The Napier Committee endorsed theirviews.   The senior officers of the Services have expressed strong opinionsagainst other rank representation at courts-martial because of thepossible adverse effects on Service discipline.   I think that before theCabinet decide this question they should hear the views of the Chiefs ofStaff as professional heads of the Services.a . S ministry of Defence, S. W. 1. ,23RD JANUARY, 1951.
&apos;    12fiANNEXOTHER RANKS TO SERVE ON COURTS-MARTIAL227.    We also considered a suggestion that in future other ranks should serve as members of courts-martial.228.    The first proposal was that if a private were being tried.,another private should be a member of the court. Such a privatewould, however, if he were a national serviceman,  normally be18 or 19 years of age or thereabouts, and be possessed of verylittle Service experience. If, however, ho were a regularsoldier, and had several years&apos; Service experience he wouldbe a soldier who,  in spite of this, had failed to gain promotion to non- commissioned&apos; rank.    The suggestion that either ofthese persons should serve upon a court-martial would not, wethink, be generally acceptable:  and indeed after pointing outthe difficulty in question, we heard no satisfactory answer to it.229.    The next proposal was that if a private soldier were beingtried by a District Court-Martial,  he should have the rightto require that one member of the court should be a non-commissioned officer of the rank of full corporal:  that acorporal being tried should similarly be entitled to elect thatonu member of the court should be another corporal;  and aSerjeant another Serjeant and so on. The non-commissionedofficer to sit upon the court should be selected by his owncommanding officer.230.    The basis of the proposal was that just as in civilcriminal courts a man &quot;is tried by his peers&quot; so also,  subjectto the requirements of discipline, should he be tried in theServices. Another suggested reason was that a mixed court of* the kind proposed would be less of a &quot;class&quot; court than onecomposed entirely of officers. Other witnesses said that if, forexample, a corporal were being tried for an offence it wouldbe an advantage to have a member of the court who. wouldunderstand more about a corporal&apos;s life as such than an officercould be expected to do.231,    If trial by one&apos;s &quot;peers&quot; means trial by one&apos;s equal inrank,  then no such thing exists in civil life. If a civilian istried by Justices either in Petty or &quot;Quarter Sessions he has no right to require that one member of the court shall be of thesame rank in life as himself,  or of the same occupation. Norhas he any such right in relation to a jury if he is triedat Assizes,    Moreover, the proposal now being considered wouldgrant trial by one&apos;s &quot;peers&quot; (in this sense) to all non-commissioned and warrant officers above the rank of lance-corporal&quot;, but deny it to the much larger number of lance-corporalsand privates.    We feel, therefore, that if the proposal is to bejustified it must bo on some other ground than the suggestedanalogy with civil rights.232.    We have considered the suggestion in relation to three questions.    First, would it. tend to improve the  quality of the court? Second, would it tend to improve the prospect,  orthe appearance,  of justice being done?    Third, would it tend toimprove or.impair discipline?233. In considering the first question we do not limitourselves to District Courts-Martial. If the proposal be agood one it seems to us it would be equally good for all kinds of court-martial.    The prime consideration here is to selectthe best kind of court, and one offering the greatest prospectof doing justice. This problem necessarily has to be dealt withon general lines. It would not be possible on each occasion when
a court-martial had. to bo convened to conduct a preliminaryenquiry as to who,  of tho persons available, and irrespective of rank, wore best fitted by training and temperament to situpon the court.    But in general,  those who have attained. commissioned rank,  are by their education,  training and experience best fitted for this duty.    It cannot reasonablytoe asserted that the quality of the court would necessarily be improved by the addition of a non-commissioned officerselected by the accused&apos;s commanding officer or frhe accusedh imself.23k*    Would the prospect of justice being done,  however, bethereby improved?   Assuming a corporal wore being tried, acourt whose members were ignorant of a corporal&apos;s duties and difficulties,  and tho general conditions of his life as such,might be less likely to do justice than a court possessed of such knowledge.    In the days when all officers came intothe Army from Sandhurst or Woolwich or the public schools,there may have been some so out of touch with the lives ofthe non-commissioned officers and men under them that they ought not to sit in judgement upon them:  though they wouldbe bad officers if this were the case.    But today, when nearly all officers have to graduate from tho ranks,  the danger in question is a remote risk.    Furthermore, as the schemefor legal aid in the Army develops, more and more accusedpersons will be legally represented;  and one of the things anyreasonably competent defending solicitor or counsel would not fail to do would be to remind the court by evidence orotherwise of any difficulties peculiar to tho accused&apos;srank or duties which it was relevant to consider.235.. So far as concerns the appearance of justice being donekhis does not,  in our view, depend primarily up.,n the composition of a court. It depends upon the way the court discharges its duties: whether it is patient,  impartial, ready to assist thoaccused where it is proper that he should be assisted,in a wordwhether the court is judicial.    It depends also upon the rights&quot;which tho particular system of trial accords to tho accused,  andthe safeguards which it -provides, in his favour. The presence ofa person of equal rank to the accused upon the court per seaffects none of these matters,236.    as to discipline,  the proposal in question seriouslyperturbed tho senior officers of tho Army and the Royal AirForce to whom it was put.    Their view was that it might havea very damaging effect upon discipline; and their opinion was all the more impressive because in relation to almost every other change which we have recommended in this Report,we found, their outlook both enlightened and progressive. Asregards this particular suggestion, however&apos;, they said thatin the Services discipline is finally in the hands of officers,and that courts-martial, which arc one of the instruments of discipline,  should bo wholly manned by officers. They also attached great importance,  now that officers are graduatingfrom the ranks,  to maintaining strictly the status an officerhis hitherto enjoyed,237.    We report,  therefore:-(a) That the proposal would not tend to improve the quality ofthe court,  nor the prospect or appearance of justicebeing done.(b) That senior officers in the Army and in the Royal AirForce consider that the proposal, if carried into effect,would impair discipline.
238.    Certain difficulties would in any event arise. Forexample,  from what unit should the non-commissioned officer in question be selected?   To try a follow non-commissionedofficer would be an indivious task to impose upon anon-commissioned officer from the same unit as the accused.Yet if the selection is made from some other unit^  the court would not have the benefit of the knowledge of local&apos;conditions, etc., which is one of the arguments by whichthe proposal is supported,    Again assume, as might happen,that a warrant officer,  serjoant and corporal are beingjointly tried.      What then should be the composition cf thecourt?239.    These,  however,  are procedural difficulties, and nodoubt could bo overcome. The fundamental objections are thatin the emphatic opinion of those who ought to know the suggested innovation would damage discipline,  and that inour opinion.it would not improve the administration ofjustice. In fact there would be a danger that the non-co mmissioned officer selected to sit would tend to regardhimself as being ue the court in a representative ratherthan in a judicial capacity.21+0.    Por these reasons,  we do not recommend the proposal.EXTRACT FROM FIRST REPORT OF THE PILCHSR COMMITTEERatings as Members of Courts-Martial60.-    For this reason,  among others,  we are also opposed tothe suggestion that when a rating or other rank is beingtried,  he should have the right to ask that the court should nelude one or more ratings or other ranks. We do notthink that the inclusion jf ratings would result in animprovement in the administration, of justice. It ismoreover probable that such a change would have an adverse   -effect upon discipline and in particular we consider thata rating who had sat on a court might sometimes be in amost difficult position on the lower deck after the trial,whether it resulted in a conviction or in an acquittal.
