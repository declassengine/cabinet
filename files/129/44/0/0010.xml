this  document  is  the   property   of  his  britannic  majesty&apos;s   governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.  January 1951CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 3 2CP. (51) 1015rA January, 1951CABINETPROPOSED PROTOCOL TO THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE convention on HUMAN RIGHTS AND FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will recollect that whenjthe Cabinet last considered its attitude to the Convention on Human Rights of the council of Europe we agreed to supportit, and we have since then signed it. We decided, however, not to agree to amend-ments proposed by the Consultative Assembly containing draft Articles on theRights to Property, Education and Political Freedom (CM, (50) 68th Conclusions,Minute 2 (4). This decision was reached after full discussion in a smaller Com-mittee of Ministers (GEN. 337/1st Meeting). Our objection to the inclusion ofthese Articles was, I think, principally concerned with their unsatisfactory draftingrather than with the undesirability of including any Articles at all relating to these subjects.2. When the Convention was signed the Committee of Ministers of theCouncil of Europe decided to leave the Rights in question for further considerationby a Committee of Experts, and it was suggested by M. Schuman that they mightbe included in a Protocol to the Convention. The Secretary-General of the Councilof Europe has asked the signatories to provide, by early January, draft texts ofArticles on these Rights which they would be willing to accept. I now recommend to my colleagues that His Majesty&apos;s Government should play a full part in the drafting of a Protocol containing these three Rights, with the objective of adhering to it, and that the Cabinet should approve the draft texts of Articles on the rights in question which appear later in this paper, so that they may be circulated to theother signatories and considered by the Committee of Experts.3. It was principally because of opposition by His Majesty&apos;s Government thatthe Articles in question were omitted from the Convention. It has become clearthat a considerable body of European opinion is aware of this and we are beingcriticised for it. It would thus be politically advantageous if we could now with-draw our opposition and agree to a Protocol. Conversely we should be in an embarrassing position if we maintained our opposition to the conclusion of a protocol, which is likely to be accepted by most, if not all, of the signatories of theConvention. There would be serious disadvantage in refusing to support the rights to Property, to Education, and to Free elections properly defined. Their rejectionin principle would be difficult to justify either abroad or at home. The Committeeof Experts has been constituted for the precise purpose of overcoming the difficulty which faced us previously, that we could not accept Articles drafted as were those contained in the Assembly amendments. It would, therefore, be ungracious aswell as impolitic to refuse to take part.Enforcement Machinery, the Reservations Article (64) and Application to theColonies4. The Working Party on Human Rights, a sub-committee of the steering committee on International Organisations, has considered these questions, and recommended that all provisions of the Convention relating to its application and enforcement, including its extension to the Colonies, should apply separately and39954
equally to the Protocol. The possibility of separate acceptance of the convention and the Protocol by a Colonial territory is particularly important because manyColonies may be able to accept the Convention but may not be able to accept the protocol. It would also be desirable to provide that a Colony could accept oneor more articles of the Protocol without accepting the whole Protocol. I under-stand that our Legal Advisers believe that this can easily be arranged. I thinktherefore that no particular difficulty need be expected on account of the con-stitutional status of our Colonial Territories.The Draft Texts of the Three Articles5. The Right to PropertyText proposed by the Assembly&quot; Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of hispossessions. Such possessions cannot be subjected to arbitrary confiscation. Thepresent measures shall not, however, beconsidered as infringing, in any way, theright of a State to pass necessary legisla-tion to ensure that the said possessionsare utilised in accordance with thegeneral interest.&quot;United Kingdom Text proposed by theWorking Party&quot; Everyone has the right to peacefulenjoyment of his possessions. This rightmay be abridged or restricted in theperson&apos;s own interests, to protect therights of other persons, to serve the endsof justice or to further the well-being ofthe community as a whole.&quot;It will be seen that the second sentence of the United Kingdom text is quite different from that prepared by the Assembly. It seemed to the Working Party on human Rights that it was essential to make clear that the right to property exists,and may be exercised, only to the extent that it does not conflict with other rightsand considerations which are or may be protected by law, and which should be specified. The phrase &quot; arbitrary confiscation &apos;&apos; has been eliminated on the groundthat it is meaningless in this context, and that we have previously objected to its inclusion. It is very likely that this article will be the subject of much debate inthe Committee of Experts, and our representative may have to refer back for instructions. I suggest that we should leave it to the Working party on human rights to give those instructions unless they find that political considerations are involved. In particular, we might authorise the Working Party to accept anadditional phrase relating to the need for due process of law if this proves necessary.6. The Right to EducationText proposed by the Assembly&quot; Every person has the right to educa-tion. The function assumed by the state in respect of education and of teachingmay not encroach upon the right ofparents to ensure the religious and moraleducation and teaching of their children in conformity with their own religiousand philosophical convictions.&quot;Text proposed by the Working Party&quot; Everyone has the right to education and the State shall ensure the provisionof the means of education so far as its resources permit. In exercising anyfunction in respect of education and of teaching, the State shall pay due regardto the right of parents to ensure the religious and moral education and teach-ing of their children in conformity withtheir own religious and philosophicalconvictions.&quot;The Colonial Office has pointed out that if the phrase &quot; the right to education &quot; means, as seems probable, that everyone has a right to have educationprovided for,him, this right (if unlimited) would be inapplicable to a number ofour Colonies both now and for a very considerable time to come. A phrase has there fore been included in the first sentence of the draft Article to make clear thatthis right is limited by the resources of the territory.. I understand that, unless theadditional phrase is included, the Colonial Office would prefer to see the Articleentirely rejected. It must, however, be recognised that to refuse to accept the rightto education would be politically as difficult at home and with our Europeanneighbours as to refuse either of the others. The Ministry of Education would besatisfied if the first sentence read simply &quot; Everyone has the right to education.&quot;
The second sentence of the Article has been amended to conform more closely with United Kingdom practice by providing that States shall &quot; pay due regard &quot;to the desires of parents in the matter of education. Even in this form, however,this Article might be used by religious groups in certain countries to exercisepressure on the State for political ends. If there is opposition at the Council ofEurope to the second sentence of the text on these grounds, I think that we shouldnot press for&apos; its retention.7. The Right to Political LibertyText Proposed by the Assembly&quot; The High Contracting Parties under -take to respect the political liberty oftheir nationals and, in particular, withregard to their home territories, to holdfree elections at reasonable intervals bysecret ballot under conditions which will ensure that the Government and legis-lature shall represent the opinion of thepeople.&quot;Text Proposed by the Working Party&quot; The High Contracting Parties under-take to respect the political liberty oftheir nationals and, in particular, to holdfree elections at reasonable intervals bysecret ballot under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinionof the people in the choice of Govern-ment and legislature.&quot;Objection can no doubt be taken to this Article on the ground that it is not appropriate for inclusion in a Convention which is intended to guarantee the rightsof individuals and that it would be particularly difficult to secure the observance of its provisions. On the other hand, there is no doubt that much importance is attached by opinion represented in the Council of Europe to the inclusion of theArticle, that it would be peculiarly difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to con-tinue to oppose it and that our reasons for doing so would be misunderstood.Previous United Kingdom objections to this Article have been centred on two points. The first is concerned with the possibility that the Article as drafted bythe Assembly might require us to adopt an electoral system of proportional repre-sentation. The text prepared by the Working Party removes this objection.f The second concerns the phrase &quot; with regard to their home territories,&quot; which,it has been suggested, draws attention to the Colonies in an unfavourable light.In fact, it is not necessary to confine the right to hold free elections, &amp;c, to hometerritories because it is already applicable in some of the Colonies. I suggest,therefore, that the phrase might conveniently be omitted in the text submitted tothe Committee of Experts. We must, however, face the fact that at their present stage of constitutional development the majority of Colonies will not be able toaccept the Article.E.
