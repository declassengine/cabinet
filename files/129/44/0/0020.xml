(51) 2019th January, 1951CABINETECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF THE DEFENCE PROPOSALSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerA. introduction the Chiefs of Staff have now completed their examination of the directions in which defence preparations could most profitably be accelerated. The main features of their proposals are summarised in the following table, which also includesestimates of the expenditures recommended by the Defence (Transition) Committeeon civil defence and on the stockpiling for strategic purposes of certain importedkey commodities. These estimates do not include the cost of armaments which theChiefs of Staff hope will be received from the United States and are necessary to achieve the degree of preparedness envisaged in their report.Table IExpenditure on Defence Preparations 1950-54  million total.

The purpose of the strategic stockpiling programme is to import and hold in reserve against an emergency a supply of imported raw materials, food-stuffs and oil. The figures in the table represent requirements and take no account of the fact that many of the commodities concerned are unlikely to be availablefor stockpiling in the quantities required. They include expenditure on buildings for storing thestockpiles.(2) The figures represent the programme contained in the report of the Defence TransitionCommittee less items already included under b.  There is at present no programme for 1953-54.
2. It will be seen that, as compared with the  3,600 million programme con-sidered in the autumn, for which at that time we asked the United States forassistance of  550 million, we now have a programme of military expenditure of nearly  4,500 million. In additional proposals by the civil departments for pre-liminary work on civil defence preparations are provisionally estimated to amountto some  260 million.&apos; These estimates do not take into account any price increases which cannot be foreseen with certainty and therefore, in my view, considerablyunderestimate the level of expenditure in later years. In addition, the service departments are proposing a substantial investment in new capacity in order toproduce new weapons and provide for a further expansion of the output of existingweapons after 1952. Whether this expansion of industrial capacity is financed from private or public funds it represents an additional strain on the nation&apos;s resources.It is estimated that the additional machine tools required for this purpose willalone amount to some  65 million in value and this is over and above the  50million of machine tools needed for producing arms during the next two years.3. The figures in Table I show that the new proposals are more in the natureof an increase than an acceleration of the defence programme. Thus of the additional 875 million only  150 million will be spent in 1951-^-52. The reasons for this aregiven in the Chiefs of Staff paper. Neverthelss the rate at which expenditure on defence production will be increasing compared with 1950-51 is substantial. By1951-52 defence production will have increased to nearly 2\ times and by 1953-54to nearly A\ times the 1950-51 level. This will face us with serious problems connected with the turnover of productive capacity, the movement of labour and thereduction of supplies of certain kinds of goods to both the home and export markets.4. The Chiefs of Staff make the following recommendations on Service man-power: (i) To raise Service man-power strengths to a total of 880-890 thousand on1st April, 1952, as compared with a total of about 690 thousand at1st April, 1950.(ii) In addition to call up in 1951 some 290,000 reservists for periods of trainingranging from fifteen days to three months.5. There is no need to emphasise the importance of achieving these defenceobjectives to the fullest extent possible; the report by the Chiefs of Staff shows that,even so, our military strength at the end of 1952 will be well below what is desirable.But it is also important to remember that our aim in strengthening the defences of thecountry is to prevent a major war and that we are not proceeding on the assump-tion that war is inevitable. In these circumstances the need to preserve the external financial strength of the economy is as imperative to-day as at any time in the post-war period. If we became involved in a major war international financial arrange-ments would no doubt be worked out to relieve us of immediate concern for thebalance of payments. But so long as we are successful in preserving peace there isno reliable prospect of receiving general external financial assistance. E.R.P. aidhas now been suspended and the chances of our receiving general financial com-pensation under any ultimate arrangements for mutual aid remain very uncertain.6. Nothing has happened to change the need for the United Kingdom to run an external current surplus of at least  100 million; our external commitments(including E.P.U. and the Colombo plan) are indeed such that the surplus of  200million achieved in 1950 is really necessary for continued health. Nevertheless,in what we must hope will be the temporary circumstances of the next few yearsof intensive rearmament, it is legitimate to make some temporary and limitedsacrifice in external financial objectives along with other civilian objectives. i recommend that we should accept as a minimum objective for external financial policy during the rearmament period&apos; the maintenance of our overseas earningsat the level required to cover expenditure on current imports.7. To achieve even this objective will involve most difficult and unpleasantaction, the general character of which is discussed in Section C below. But failure to achieve such a balance would carry the risk of destroying the whole of our external financial stability which has been re-established so arduously during thelast few years. Even with such a balance there is bound to be a considerable risein short-term sterling liabilities, to the extent that the United Kingdom is investing
abroad, repaying debt and importing for the strategic stockpile. Moreover, sincepurchases for the stockpile will be recorded as current imports the balance ofpayments will appear publicly as in deficit. Both these developments will weakenconfidence in sterling. While such a situation will be just manageable for a limited period, any more extensive deterioration could have really serious consequences.8. We are faced, therefore, with a prohlem of which wejhave little previous experience, namely, to divert to defence purposes a substantial proportion of theresources of an economy which is already fully employed and must continue toprovide out of its current output enough to maintain a healthy external financialposition. Moreover, this task has to be undertaken during a period when general economic circumstances are developing very unfavourably for the United Kingdom.In particular:  (a) The terms of trade have been moving heavily against the United Kingdomthroughout 1950, are likely to continue to worsen during 1951, and, at best, are unlikely to improve in 1952. This development will make thetask of maintaining external financial equilibrium immensely moredifficult. It also has serious implications for the internal price leveland the cost of living which will give rise to major political problems(see Section D).&apos; (b) Severe shortages have developed of a number of essential raw materials,and of coal, gas and electricity. While the precise extent and implications-tions of such shortages is very uncertain, there can be little doubt thatthey will impose a serious check to the rapid growth of production,which has been the main reason for the growth in the United Kingdom&apos;economic strength during the last few years.9. I must further point out that the major part of the proposed increase in defence expenditure represents a claim for increased production from a compara-tively narrow range of industries; primarily from certain sections of the metal-using industries. The problem of quickly switching over a substantial proportionof the labour, materials and capacity of these industries is difficult enough initself. But in addition these are the industries which provide both one half of current exports and also the investment goods on which the United Kingiom&apos;future economic strength depends. To the extent that defence requirements can-not be met from increased production, therefore, the export problem will be intensified and we shall be faced with severe difficulties in some fields of homeinvestment.10. The general principle which should guide us must be, nevertheless (apartfrom abandoning the target of a surplus in our balance of payments and acceptinginstead basic equilibrium), to take as much as possible of the necessary sacrifices on current consumption rather than to burden the future by any serious reduction in investment or the incurring of overseas debt. We must also choose deliberately,both on grounds of social policy and to assist the execution of the defence programme, the places where the sacrifices must fall and not leave this to the arbitrary and inefficient operation of inflation. This will require, on the one hand,the adoption of all possible measures to limit expenditure on consumption (and tosome extent on investment as well) and on the other the use of certain direct controls,which I discuss later in this paper. I must emphasise that the latter will be difficultto operate in peacetime and will not function properly unless they are accompaniedby the strict application of those policies of monetary and budgetary restraint whichhave served us so well in recent years. Unless general fiscal influences work in thesame direction as the other measures which we must take, we shall inevitably find that the latter are ineffective and our own decisions frustrated and we will lose the battle against inflation.11. In view of the character of the problem which confronts us, and the greatuncertainties about such fundamental factors as the terms of trade and the rawmaterial situation, we cannot at this early stage lay down a precise and detailed plan of action or attempt to forecast in exact detail the sacrifices which rearmament willimpose. We can, however, see pretty clearly the kind of problems which are likelyto arise and the principles we should follow in dealing with them and gain some idea of the sacrifices which we shall have to make.&apos; Section B deals with the major industrial problems likely to result from the concentration of defence requirementson a comparatively narrow range of industries. The export problem is discussed in Section C.  Section D summarises the general economic prospect which faces
us. I should point out that the analysis is largely of the position in 1952-53, since it is until then that the most serious dislocation is likely to be felt. The burden ofdefence will continue to increase thereafter.B. The Industrial Impact of the Defence Programme12.   The greater part of defence demands upon production will fall on threeindustrial groups; the metal-using industries, building, and clothing and textiles.     (Table IIDefence^) Demands, on Production  millionExpenditure on - 1950-51       1951-52       1952-53Metal goods and engineering products        .165 343 560Clothing and textiles(2)      ...... 10 55 77Works and buildings(3)     ...... 82 160 190i1) Includes Civil Defence.(2) Requirements for the Fighting Services cover clothing only and omit textiles classified as general stores.(3) Includes buildings required for storage of stockpiles, in addition to the works programmes of the Fighting Services and for Civil Defence shown in Table I.The Metal-Using Industries13. The major requirements of the Service Departments for production bythe metal-using industries are summarised in the following table.Table IIIService Department Requirements for &quot; Metal Goods &quot;(&apos;)  million	1950-51	1951-52	1952-53Shipbuilding and marine engineering	30	58	80Aircraft        ............	60	113	177Vehicles        ............	30	63	117Radio, radar, &amp;c..........	11	26	37Other...............	34	73	131Total        ......	165	333	542(*) Requirements of machine tools are not included in this table. Nor are civil defence require-ments which are roughly estimated at  20 million for vehicles and  10 million for other metal goods,over the next two years.These will involve raising the production of military aircraft for the UnitedKingdom significantly above the level of production of aircraft of all kinds in 1950;devoting at least one-third of the capacity of the motor vehicle industry to defence production; and a volume of work for the Navy by shipyards and marine engineering establishments equivalent to over 40 per cent, of their current output.14.   To achieve the defence programme we shall need (a) Substantial physical transfers of labour to industries, such as aircraft andthe R.O.F.&apos;s, which are not at present working to full capacity. About250,000 additional workers are likely to be needed in the next two years for aircraft and the R.O.F.&apos;s alone. &apos;(b) Directions by the Government to firms in industries whose capacity isalready fully employed to defer work on civil orders in order to takedefence contracts.(c) The creation of substantial new capacity in certain sections of the metalusing industries, particularly for aircraft and tank production.I must emphasise the difficulties to be overcome in accomplishing such changes inthe metal-using industries, for which, unlike the building industry, there is no com-prehensive apparatus of control already in existence.
Providing Man-power: (paragraph 14 (a))15. It would obviously be most desirable if the labour required for the aircraft factories, R.O.F.&apos;s, &amp;c, could be drawn from activities outside the metal-using field,not associated with production for export or for home investment. By reducingthe labour employed in producing for consumption, we should be placing the defenceburden on consumption where it would do least damage,&apos; and avoid in this respect the cutting down of deliveries of capital equipment for home use and exports.16. Some expansion of total employment in the metal-using industries is infact likely to occur, since many branches of the industry are attractive to workers.Unfortunately there can be no hope of solving the whole problem in this way.Shortage of non-ferrous metals is likely to limit strictly the possibility of expandingtotal output and employment in the metal-using industries. Moreover, it is quite certain that other bottlenecks in resources special to these industries, e.g.,, in skilled labour, key technicians and particular components, will quickly appear if we try to rely on drawing labour exclusively from consumer goods industries, outside the metal-using field. Indeed, the load, which will in any case fall on certain of the investment goods industries, such as machine tools, drop forgings, ball bearings, willbe extremely heavy and bottlenecks here may be expected to create other bottle-necks elsewhere.17. To a considerable extent, therefore, the labour and other resources needed for manning up existing capacity for defence production will have to be found fromother sections of the metal-using industries which are not capable of executingdefence contracts. It will be no easy task to enforce such a contraction in employ-ment on production for civilian use at a time when both domestic and export demandfor the products of these industries is very high, and for which in any case therewould be insufficient raw materials available for them to continue on their normalcivilian work. Besides the creation of the appropriate fiscal climate, the followingdirect measures will be necessary to enforce such a contraction:  (i) Allocation of raw materials so as to restrict supplies intended for theproduction of less essential metal goods, supported by direct admini-strative action to restrict the production of certain articles. This will include limitation of supply orders, and in some cases outright prohibi-tion of the production of particular articles. Such action may well haveto be reinforced by particular fiscal measures, such as purchase tax. Ipropose to arrange for officials to make further studies of the measureswhich will be needed to limit civil output in the metal-using industries in this way.(ii) Control of engagement and even direction of labour will be necessary atsome stage in addition to the above measures to ensure that the labourso released goes into the expanding defence factories and if we acceptthe new defence programme we must clearly understand that this isimplied. The Ministry of Labour stress, however, that these labour controls should not be introduced and cannot be effective until the rightclimate of public opinion has been created, and that public opinion is farfrom ready for such a step at present. It is for consideration whether we should announce at once our intention to use such powers if andwhen the need arises. The Economic Planning Board agree that controlof engagement and direction of labour will almost certainly be necessary at some stage, but the Trades Union members recommended most strongly that the announcement of the intention to introduce them should for the present be deferred until there has been time to educatethe country about the realities of the international situation.18. It should clearly be our intention to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, the industries and firms within the metal-using group which are forced to contract are those producing durable consumer goods, such as washing machines,kitchenware, vacuum cleaners, radio, television, &amp;c, so that we shield productionof essential capital goods for investment and exports. The consequences of deferringconsumption are much less dangerous than those of deferring investment.Directions to Manufacturers (paragraph 14 (b))19. The problem of achieving the necessary increase in defence production isnot, however, simply one of finding the necessary labour and materials to man upcapacity in defence industries which is at present under-employed.  A substantial
part of the defence demand will fall on industries whose capacity is already virtuallyfully employed on civilian work, such as the motor vehicle industry, heavy electrical engineering, &amp;c. In these cases it will be necessary to direct manufacturers tocarry out defence orders in place of civilian work already on order. Given thecreation of an atmosphere of national urgency, which is an essential condition forthe execution of the whole programme, the more responsible manufacturers will nodoubt voluntarily give precedence to defence orders. But formal direction will benecessary even in these cases to protect firms from legal action for breach of contract.20. In most cases where capacity is limited there will be direct conflict betweenthe needs of defence, investment and exports. The output of the metal-using industries is so varied that it is impossible to lay down any general rule in advanceas to how these conflicts should be resolved. It may be possible in some cases tointroduce double or treble shift working. The problem then becomes one of labourand material supply and would have to be dealt with on the lines indicated inparagraphs 13-16 above. Apart from this and so far as is consistent with notdelaying defence preparations, the intention here, again, should be to place as large a proportion of defence orders as possible on firms supplying civilian goods (suchas durable consumer goods), where the consequences of interruption in supplies is both predictable and least damaging. The Ministry of Supply must undertakeand encourage all possible sub-contracting of work on components for defence production to firms producing such consumption goods. It may be that in theearly stages of the expansion of defence production the scope for this will not be great, but the principle should be pushed to the limit consistent with carrying outthe programme. Outside these cases, we are faced with the most difficult problemof minimising so far as possible the damage which will be caused by interruption ofsupplies of capital goods for export and for home industry, and of spreading such reductions in supplies between home and overseas customers.21. Although we must take all possible steps to get defence orders placed andexecuted quickly, it is quite clear from wartime experience that to award automaticoverriding priority to defence orders, to be applied without consultation, would lead to widespread dislocation and confusion not only for the civilian economy butfor the defence programme itself. There are clearly some requirements of UnitedKingdom industry failure to meet which would cause quite disproportionate wastageand dislocation. Such cases are particularly likely to arise in the case of componentswhich are not in themselves final products. Similarly, there will be cases whereacute difficulty in bilateral trade negotiations may result from failure to export quitesmall quantities of particular products. The Economic Planning Board accepted that it was wrong to introduce any system of overriding priority.22. On the other hand it is clear that so long as nearly 80 per cent, of theresources of the metal-using industries are employed on civil work, there can beno question of detailed control of the destination of their output. There is neitherthe staff nor the knowledge to work such a system. The situation with which weare faced is in fact the reverse of that at the peak of the last war; in 1943, 80 percent, of the labour in the metal-using industries was working, directly or indirectly,for the Supply Departments.23. I have, therefore, arranged for interdepartmental machinery to be setup with the task of (a) examining in advance proposals by the supply departments which involvea particularly damaging effect on production for home investment orfor exports;(b) reviewing other cases where action already taken by the supply deparment is having a particularly damaging effect either on exports or on domesticinvestment.24. As regards the extent to which deferment of civil orders should fall on home or overseas customers, it is quite clear that in the case of durable consumer goods produced-by the metal-using industries (amongst which I include motor vehicles) preference, after defence orders, must be given to exports over the home market. As I show in Section C, the export problem will be most formidable. Sofar as engineering capital goods are concerned the problem of how the burdenshould be spread between exports and investment is one where it is impossible togeneralise. We shall have to give guidance to particular industries and firms asthe situation develops.
Creation of New Capacity (paragraph 14 (c))25. In addition to the manning-up of defence capacity and the displacementof civil by military work needed to achieve the production programmes for 1951and 1952, the defence departments also propose a substantial expansion of capacity,particularly for tanks and aircraft, which will come into production in later years.I appreciate that this proposal, which is somewhat akin to the construction of&quot; shadow &quot; factories before the last war, is no less important than the other partsof the plan although the Chiefs of Staff were not able in their paper to go into any great detail. But there is no doubt that it will also give rise to very formidableproblems. Provisional estimates suggest that this will require some  65 million of machine tools over the next two years in addition to the  50 million required for additional production of defence goods during these two years. United kingdom production of metal-working machine tools is at present little more than  40 million per year. Consequently it is obvious that, even if we secure, as we must, as largean import of machine tools as is possible, we shall be faced with the greatestobstacles in meeting this demand. I am arranging for officials to make an imme-diate study of the way in which these obstacles can best be overcome, includingthe possible reinstitution of the Machine Tool Control. I suggest we defer a finaldecision on this proposal to expand capacity until we see just what it implies.General Conclusions26. It will be clear from the preceding analysis that the defence programme is going to involve very serious difficulties, both for exports and for home invest-ment. However great the administrative skill in placing defence orders a heavy burden is bound to fall on certain industries, for example, the aircraft, machine tool and boiler-making industries, whose products are most readily saleable abroad,and their exports will, therefore, fall. It is vital for our external position that thedecline in such exports should be compensated by higher exports from othermetal-using industries. This will tax the ingenuity both of Government andindustry to the utmost. I have assumed for the analysis of the export problem in Section C that we shall be successful in maintaining the volume of exports of metal goods at the average level achieved in 1950, but I must warn my colleagues that the most energetic measures will be needed to achieve this objective. I mustfurther emphasise that, similarly, severe limitations on certain vital products arejound to be felt in the field of home investment and may give rise to acutedifficulties.The Building Industry27. The proposals of the defence departments together with the requirementsof the civil departments as roughly estimated imply an increase in expenditure on building work from  80 million in 1950-51, to  160 million in 1951-52 and  19.million in 1952-53. This means that defence preparations will be absorbing about 180 million of building resources in the calendar year 1952, or more than halfthose now employed on the housing programme.- 28. In the case of building, unlike that of the metal using industries, we arein a position to exercise a direct influence on the level of employment in theindustry, by controlling building licences and starting dates. In view of the heavydemand on man-power and resources in general flowing from the defence pro-gramme as a whole and from the export needs discussed below, and also of thelimits likely to be imposed by supplies of building materials, I recommend that weshould make it our objective to prevent any increase in employment in the buildingindustry.29. How difficult an objective this will be obviously largely depends on wherethe defence requirements are concentrated. In the short term, if manipulation of starting dates is not sufficient to ensure speedy execution of defence works at theexpense of civil works the issue of directions to firms may again be necessary. i recommend that the Headquarters Building Committee in consultation with the investment Programmes Committee should be asked to report as a matter of urgency on measures which will be necessary to meet defence requirements for building work and technical staff.30. While general control over investment programmes can do little to solve the problem during 1951, it is clear that the Investment Programmes Committeewill have to provide for some easement of civilian demands on the building industryin 1952. Unless the productivity of building labour increases by more than 3 per
cent, annually, which is the most on which it seems prudent to count, civil demandswill have to be reduced by some 2-3 per cent, below the level of 1950. In view ofthe increased demands for civil building work at present being submitted by depart-ments, such a reduction will be both difficult and painful. While it is obviouslyimpossible at this stage to indicate what may be reviewed we cannot rule out alto-gether some curtailment of the housing programme.31. The prospect is much worse if we have to give serious consideration to theissue on which I understand the Home Secretary will submit a memorandum. Thebuilding work which the civil departments consider that it would be necessary tocomplete during the first year of a major war (largely to provide shelter for thecivil population) far exceeds the amount which it would be possible to carry out during such a period&apos;. But to carry out such work now, in preparation for thepossibility of war, would, unquestionably, involve enormous reductions in civil work, including the housing programme.The Textile and Clothing Industries32. The programme of the defence departments provides for increasingexpenditure on clothing from roughly  10 million in the current fiscal year toover  60 million in 1952-53. To this must be added a civil defence requirement of some  24 million of clothing, blankets and other textiles during the next twoyears. These demands represent over 10 per cent, of the total output of the wooltextile industry. In the cotton industry they would be heavily concentrated on particular sections (canvasses, drills, webbing, &amp;c). After 1952, however, theservice demand is expected to fall sharply. As is made clear in the following section the textile industries will also be facing a most formidable export task,which itself will involve heavy reductions in supplies to home consumers. Theprospect is, therefore, of a very heavy load on the textile industries in 1952, partof which would disappear in the following year. I suggest, therefore, that thedefence departments should further examine the possibilities first of placing more of their orders for textiles abroad and, second of deferring some part of their requirements until 1953. Clothing can be produced relatively quickly, so that theprogramme could quickly be accelerated if a further worsening of the international situation made this expedient.33. Finally, I must remind my colleagues that the carrying through of themeasures necessary to achieve the defence programme will place a heavy increasedburden on the civil service which is not allowed for in the estimates. In view ofthe general shortage of trained man-power and the need to limit the claims of theGovernment on the nation&apos;s man-power, it is imperative that we should allexamine the work of our departments with a view to releasing man-power fromless essential work to meet these new administrative needs.C.   The Export Problem34. I recommended in Section A that we should take as a minimum objectivethe maintenance of export earnings throughout the rearmament period at the levelnecessary to pay for imports for current use. This section examines in greater detail the problems which are likely to arise in achieving that objective.35. Some increase in the volume of imports for current use is likely and neces-sary in the next two years. Indeed, were supplies available, larger imports of certain commodities would be desirable than it seems possible to count on. The future of import prices, however, is very uncertain. Import prices in 1951 are likely to be some 16 per cent, higher than in 1950, and some further increase, say 5 per cent.,seems the most likely prospect for 1952. Taken in conjunction with the assump-tions about export prices discussed below, such a movement of import prices implies that the United Kingdom&apos;s terms of trade will be substantially worse in 1951 thanin 1950 and will not improve significantly in 1952. In the event the movement maybe even more adverse than here assumed. On these assumptions the import billis likely to rise by over  400 million in 1951 and by a further  150-200 million in1952.36. The invisible surplus is very provisionally forecast to increase by  45million in 1951 and a further  25 million in 1952. The level of exports required to yield an equilibrium on current account in 1952 is therefore  2,650 million.

Export prices are likely to continue to rise, owing both to rising costs andto the probable movement of world prices and demand, and it seems not unreason-able to assume an increase of .15 per cent, between 1950 and 1952. Were thevolume of exports to remain as in 1950, such an increase in prices would yieldroughly  330 million of the  400 million extra export earnings needed in 1952.38. But a substantial fall is in prospect in the volume of exports of some important classes of raw materials, in particular coal and coke, steel and non-ferrous metals. While the precise magnitude of this reduction will partly depend on policy decisions, in adverse circumstances it might be as much as  150 million. Moreover,as I have point out above, defence requirements are bound to reduce exports of anumber of engineering products and, even with the most energetic measures, it is exceedingly doubtful whether we can count on even the maintenance of the 1950volume of exports by the metal-using industries as a whole.39. On this assumption, however, an increase of some  200-250 million wouldbe needed in the volume of exports of goods other than raw materials, metal manu-factures, or chemicals (on which defence also makes a call and where output islikely to be limited by raw material shortages); i.e., primarily of textiles and manu-factures other than metal goods and chemicals.  million.

Possible decline in exports of fuel, raw materials, &amp;c.   ... -1506.   Required increase in volume of exports of consumer goods(4 + 5)          ...................... +23040. To get the volume of exports raised by this amount without substantial assistance from the engineering or chemical industries would be a formidable under-taking. Some allowance may be made for some small expansion in exports offood, drink, and manufactured tobacco. But most of the burden an increase ofabout  200 million in export volume must fall on the exporters of textiles andother manufactured consumer goods (of which pottery is the only substantialgroup), whose total exports in 1950 were about  600 million (of which  420 milliontextiles and clothing). The core of this problem is the need to raise textile exportsby perhaps 30 per cent, while defence demands for textiles will at least take any increase in total output.41. The measures necessary to achieve so great an increase in the volumeof exports of consumer goods will require examination, and I propose to arrangefor officials to undertake such a study urgently. But it is obvious in advance that since the need will be to limit domestic consumption of particular commodities, forour export objective we shall have to rely primarily on limiting those demandsdirectly by such means as limitation of supplies orders, rationing and similar devices.If, as seems likely, production of many of these goods will be restricted by materialshortages, there will need to be sharp cuts in supplies going to the home market.While the prospective increases in the relative prices of clothing and household goods will automatically limit domestic demand for them to some extent, it is quite possible that this will not be sufficient.
42. The problem may be even more difficult if, as is possible, world demandfor some consumer goods is not great. Wool goods are a case in point. It isprima facie unlikely that the volume of United Kingdom exports of wool goodscan be increased by over 30 per cent., when the United Kingdom is the onlysubstantial exporter and when the large increase in their relative price is likely to lead to a contraction of world demand. In general we must expect continuingcompetition for markets for some miscellaneous manufactures for which demand is limited and which are economical in the kinds of raw materials at present scarce,particularly from Japan, which will not be affected by munitions production to thesame extent as the United Kingdom. We shall to some extent, therefore, be facedwith a selling problem as well as that of making goods available.43. If exports of manufactured consumer goods are to be raised to the levelnecessary to maintain external equilibrium in 1952, when our problem will be mostsevere, it will be necessary to take action to reduce domestic demand and open upnew markets quite early in 1951. The present momentum of exports is likely toproduce a continuing though declining overseas surplus during the first half of 1951.If the new measures we must take to expand exports of consumption goods be&amp;into show their effect during the second half of the year, it is possible we may be ableto achieve something better than a precarious balance over 195.1 as a whole, andI have allowed for this in Table IV.D. The Real Cost of Rearmament to the Community44. The general character of the prospect which faces us may thus besummarised as follows. Total expenditure on defence, civil defence and stockpilingwill be rising from  865 million in 1950-51, to nearly  1,900 million in 1953-54.Within this total expenditure, we have to increase production for defence by about 250 million in 1951-52, and by a further  250 million in 1952-53. At the sametime, to pay our way abroad, we must raise total exports by some  100 millon (atpresent prices) within two years, with little or no help from the industries con-tributing most to the recent expansion and in the face of a certain decline in exportsof some classes of goods. Meanwhile, raw material shortages and the disturbanceto output caused by transfer of resources from civilian to military work, are boundto limit the expansion of industrial output. It would not be safe to count on a rateof increase of manufacturing output of more than-say 4 per cent, a year (half thevery high rate of increase experienced in the past 12 months) which would add some 225 million a year (at present prices) to total output of manufactured goods. Con-sequently, for the first time since the war we must face a reduction in the standardof living (apart from food, where there are prospects of slight improvement in supplies), in the rate at which industry is re-equipped with plant and machinery for civil production, and in the amount of building to meet civil needs. At the sametime, we shall have to struggle hard to achieve a balance of payments position which,at best, will be precarious and vulnerable and if not quickly improved on will leadto serious cumulative strains in our external financial relations.45. I have endeavoured to estimate how far we have to reduce consumption and therefore the standard of living if we are to achieve our object of carrying outthe defence programme, while accepting a slight decline in investment and exportingenough to pay for our current imports. Very roughly, I would forecast that this may imply that the supply to the home market of manufactured consumer goods(excluding food, drink and tobacco) will have to fall by about 2 per cent, perannum or by over 5 per cent, by 1953. This will mainly take the form of reducedsupplies of household goods and textiles, whose production for the home marketwe shall have to restrict deliberately, so that the firms producing them may concen-trate on defence or exports. Thus, a 25 per cent, rise in exports of textiles (about 100 million at 1950 prices), which is the least which is likely to be necessary, would imply, after allowing for defence requirements, a fall in total civil consumption ofsome 10-15 per cent. Since it would be necessary to protect industrial consumptionof textiles, the fall in supplies of clothing and household goods would be evenmore severe.46. These unpleasant developments will have to be carried out in a period during which the cost of living will be rising sharply. The steady rise in import prices which has been going on ever since devaluation and which will continueduring 1951 will be having its full effect on retail prices by 1952. This pressure on
prices is likely to be reinforced by the more rapid increase in wage rates which isnow in progress and must be expected to continue/ The rise in retail prices is likelyto be greatest in clothing and household goods possibly as much as 20 Or 25 perCent, between 1950 and 1952. The rise in food prices will be smaller between  and 10 per cent, over the two years. A tentative calculation suggests that averageretail prices (weighted by total personal expenditure in 1950) might rise by about  to 5 per cent, in 1951 over the average 1950 level, and by another 4 or 5 per cent,in 1952. The Interim Index of Retail Prices (weighted by working class consump-tion) might rise somewhat less, since clothing and household goods are less signifi-cant, and food has a larger weight.46a. Although many industrial workers may, in fact, succeed in increasing their earnings faster than the cost of living, there will undoubtedly be considerablehardship for the lower fixed income groups. Indeed, the redistribution of realincome which is the consequence of rising prices followed by rising wages, &amp;c, andwhich, of course, is mainly to the disadvantage of the fixed income groups, mayconfront us before long with difficult political problems.47. My colleagues will not expect me to deal with budgetary questions in thismemorandum, but there is no doubt that we shall be faced with some exceedinglypainful decisions in this field. I have already emphasised that, though we must usephysical controls, these must be accompanied by an appropriate monetary and fiscal policy. Our experience since 1945 shows that direct controls can only do their work effectively if at the same time the pressure of monetary demand is kept severelyunder control.Investment48. I have already referred to the probable fall of not less than 2-3 per cent,in the real volume of building for civil use. In the case of plant and machinery,there will at best be no increase over 1950 in the total volume available. within this total, there will be sharp falls in supplies of particular types of plant, while agood deal of certain types of output which is not taken up directly by the fightingservices will go to re-equip firms for producing arms, at the expense of investment for civil production. Such a restriction of domestic investment is an essential condition for carrying through the defence programme smoothly, maintainingexports at the necessary level, and preserving internal financial stability. But there* should be no illusions about the difficulty of achieving this restriction in face ofthe heavy pressure of demand for investment goods.The Balance of Payments49. I am suggesting as an objective no more than a precarious balance on international current account in 1952, and that imports for the strategic stockpileshould be paid for by borrowing overseas. I must emphasise again that evensuch a balance will give rise to great difficulties and failure to achieve this objectivewould lead to an intolerable position.50. These are serious prospects. But the position may be worse. Both theMinistry of Supply and the Board Of Trade feel that the assumption of an annual increase of 4 per cent, in industrial production is too optimistic in the light ofprospective shortages of raw materials and fuel and power and of the dislocationsto production caused by switching from civil to defence work. There is, too, thepossibility that the terms of trade will deteriorate still further than I have assumed.Even if this is not so, we shall be faced with the most formidable task in raisingconsumer goods exports by the amount likely to be necessary. A further rise of5 per cent, in average import prices, which is by no means out of the question,would add roughly  150 million to the import bill. I cannot conceive that exportsof manufactured consumer goods could rise by the amount necessary to cover suchan increase in the bill. In these circumstances we should need to reconsider manyfundamental aspects of internal and external financial policy.Recommendations of the Chiefs of Staff51. The Chiefs of Staff, in paragraph 3 (a) of CP. (51) 16, draw special attention to the conditions which their Working Party consider, necessary if the programmes recommended are to be completed in time. These conditions are set out in paragraphs 53 and 59 of the D.E./P. (51) 6, the annex to CP. (51) 16.
52. It will be seen that 1 am in general agreement with the Chiefs of staff that we must see that the new programme, if accepted, must be carried out withthe utmost speed and that whatever measures are necessary to do this must beadopted. For the reasons given in paragraph 21 above, however, I consider thatthe defence programme itself, as well as the general economic system on whichit must rest, would be hindered rather than advanced by any overriding priority,and that it must be open to the Civil Departments to make representations inparticular cases and to have these referred to Ministers for decision in cases, whichI hope and expect would be rare, where agreement among officials proved impos-sible.53. My views on the particular recommendations in the Annex to C. P. (51) 16are as follows:; Paragraph 53(a) I agree.(b) I agree subject to consultation about the particular premises to berequisitioned.(c) I agree.(d) I agree subject to consultation about the allocation of capacity be-tween defence, export and essential civil needs of firms engaged on the production of critical products or components.(e) I do not think we can agree on this without knowing more about whatis involved.  My recommendation is in paragraph 25.(/) and (h) No comment.(g) It is most unlikely that any arrangements could be made to carryout the recommendations.Paragraph 59(a) No comment.(b) I agree we must have suitable allocation schemes wherever necessary.(c) I agree.id) I agree.(e) I agree.(/) I agree. This must be done in consultation with the Board of Tradeand Ministry of Works.(g) I agree.54. It may be convenient if, in conclusion, I also summarise my own recom-mendations.Summary of Recommendations(1) We should agree now to use control of engagement and direction oflabour in so far as this is necessary to provide the labour needed by expanding defence industries, and consider when, and in what-^      way we should announce it to the country.J2) We should announce our intention to issue directions to firms where-ever necessary to execute defence orders and to defer civil workaccordingly. This power to be exercised after interdepartmentalconsultation.(3) We should, further, use powers, with appropriate interdepartmentalconsultation, to requisition factory space as necessary for defence production.(4) We should take as a minimum objective throughout the rearmamentperiod the maintenance of a balance on international current account.(5) Subject to (4) above, we should accept as our objective to bear so muchas possible of the burden of defence at the expense of currentcivilian consumption. This means that, we must be prepared totake whatever measures, fiscal and administrative, are necessaryto contract production and employment in firms producing mainly for civil consumption, both within the group. of metal-using industries and in other fields, in order to free labour or to economisein scarce materials and components. . v . ,&apos;&apos;
13 88(6) We should accept in principle the need to take drastic action, fiscal andadministrative, in order to divert from the home market sufficient supplies of consumer goods saleable abroad to achieve our balanceof payments objective.(7) The civil investment programme for building should be limited tothe output of which the industry at its present size is capable, aftermeeting the requirements of defence.(8) We should re-examine the work of our Departments to see what further steps are possible to release Government man-power from less essential work for the new administrative tasks with which weshall now be faced.H.
