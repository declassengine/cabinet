jHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT).SECRET. . CP.(51) 44 COPY NO.   ** *8TH FEBRUARY, 1951.CABINETMINERAL WORKINGS bill memorandum by the Minister of Local Government and-Planning and the Secretary of State for scotland at the meeting of the Legislation Committee on 6th February(H.P.C.(51) 4th Meeting, Minute 4, Conclusion (2)), we were invited tosubmit a memorandum on whether the Mineral Workings Bill should been larged to deal with the exploration for minerals and the working of minerals by Planning Ministers.The need for amending legislation on working rights.2. It is important to have early legislation on mineral working rights for two reasons:-(1)     The Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, has taken mineralvalues away from landowner s, who are now unwilling to sell or lease their land for mineral working except at an exorbitantprice.     If, after considering all relevant aspects, the responsible ministers decide that the working of a mineral deposit is essen-tial in the national interest, then the landowner should be com-pelled to make the land available.(2)     The Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, already containsmachinery for this purpose which is not entirely satisfactory.The Act provides two alternative methods:-(a) Land can be bought compulsorily (either by the LocalAuthority or the Central Land Board) with the Minister&apos;s*approval.     But for minerals, what is wanted is often onlyworking rights and rights of access.(b) Land can be allocated in a Development Plan for mineralworking and, if the Plan is approved by the Minister, the mineral undertaker can apply to the High Court for workingrights.     Apart from the cost in time and money of a HighCourt application, there is the difficulty that the local planning Authority cannot make exact allocations of land intheir Plans in advance.     Boring to find out the extent and quality of the deposit is normally done by the undertaker.Only then can precise boundaries be drawn.x     The Ministers referred to in this paper are, for England and Wales, theMinister of Local Government and Planning;   and for Scotland, theSecretary of State.
r    22%3. Legislation is, therefore, needed both in the interests of efficientmineral production and to simplify the procedure.Original Proposals.4. The proposal we submitted to the Lord Presidents Committee(L.P.(51) 7) was as follows:-If the Minister was satisfied (after hearing the views of all con-cerned) that certain land should, in the national interest, be worked for minerals, he should be able to make an order giving a mineral undertaker the right to work, or enabling him to buy the land cornpulsorily.An application for working rights could be dealt with at the same time as theapplication for planning permission, thus providing a simple, expeditiousand inexpensive machine.     The landowner would receive existing use value plus a payment for disturbance.     In addition, the mineral undertakerwould pay development charge to the State.5. The powers proposed resemble the ordinary compulsory purchasepowers in the 1947 Act, by which land can be bought for securing necessaryprivate or public development.     It was also proposed to transfer from theHigh Court&quot; to the responsible Minister the power to grant working rights in minerals.6. Clauses 26 - 31 of the draft Bill attached to H.P4C.(51) 11 giveeffect to these proposals.Lord Presidents Committee &apos;s decision.* 7. The Lord Presidents Committee (L.P.(51) 3rd Meeting) acceptedthe proposals, but proposed in addition that:-(1)     Ministers should have powers themselves to explore for minerals,and to grant permission for others to explore.(2)     Ministers should be able to vest the mineral rights in themselves,and should be empowered either to work the minerals themselvesor to grant leases to others to work them.Clauses to give effect to these revised proposals are attached to H,P.C.(51) 14.Comments of Legislation Committee.8. The Legislation Committee (H.P.C.(51) 4th Meeting, Minute 4), drew attention to the controversial nature of the proposals in H,P.C,(51) 14.     Itwas suggested that they would be interpreted as directed towards the com-plete nationalisation of minerals and mineral working in this country andwould arouse considerable opposition.     Moreover, if the Ministers weregiven power to explore for minerals and to work them, they would be under constant pressure to exercise these powers in the interests of localities andwithout much regard to profitability.     This might prove a serious embarrass-ment.     The Ministers had no practical experience of the working of minerals and had not the necessary technical staffs.     It was also pointed out that theinclusion of the provisions in H.P.C.(51) 14 might jeopardise the importantprovisions for the restoration of ironstone land which were the genesis ofthe Bill.x    In Scotland, the Court of Session.
Matters, for decision.9.     &apos;        There&apos; are three possible courses:-(1)     To go ahead with the proposals of the Lord presidents committee (as in paragraph 7).(2)     To go ahead with our original proposals to the Lord Presidents -Committee (as in paragraphs 4 - 5).(3)     To drop all provisions about working rights from this Bill, andto include some such provision in a separate Bill later on.10. The Minister of Local Government and Planning would prefercourse (1).     The Secretary of State would prefer course (2).     NeitherMinister favours course (3) since this would probably delay the legislationuntil next Session, and in the meantime the minerals industry would con-tinue to be in difficulties and Local Authorities would be put to a good dealof unnecessary trouble in preparing Development Plans on the basis ofexisting law.11. We ask our colleagues to decide which of the three courses inparagraph 9 should be followed.H.D.H.McN.8TH FEBRUARY, 1951.
