Printed for the Cabinet.  March 1951CONFIDENTIAL Copy No, 31CP. (51) 665th March, 1951CABINETNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HOUSEWORKERSMemorandum by the Minister of Labour and National. service the problem of improving the status and efficiency of domestic workers has for many years been a matter of concern. -A large and growing body of publicopinion holds that the domestic worker is entitled to similar protection as regardsconditions of employment and provision for leisure as is afforded to workers in industry generally. It is not a matter of adding to the luxury of the well-to-do classes.The need for efficient help in households needing the care of children, expectant mothers, invalids or elderly persons, of households where both husband and wifeare in regular employment with national advantage in the present shortage of labour,and of households of doctors and farmers has become more and more evident. TheRoyal Commission on Population emphasised this need as a means of maintainingpopulation standards adequate to the future of the country.2. Events during the war years in relation to the fullest use of available man-power underlined the urgency of the problem and Mr. Ernest Bevin invitedMiss Violet Markham and Miss Florence Hancock to investigate and report thereon whilst the war was still in progress. As a result the Government decided in 1946 to establish the Institute of Houseworkers to undertake the task of improving the status, skill and efficiency of domestic workers. It was recognised that the taskwas formidable, particularly as long-standing prejudices, based on the falseassumption that skill was easy to obtain, and need not be of any high standard,and that conditions of employment, including reasonable freedom for leisure, couldbe left to the goodwill of employers, have to be broken down. One of the first tasks of the Institute was to tackle this issue and standard conditions which provide fora 48-hour week (resident) and a 44-hour week (non-resident) with a fortnighfsholiday and one day and a half free each week were laid down. The Institute alsolaid down standards of performance and decided to issue diplomas to any domesticworker who on examination showed ability to reach these standards. About1,200 such diplomas have been issued. The lead given by the Institute will haveincreasing effect. As an example the London County Council, in building up itsHome Helps&apos; Service, has sought the aid of the Institute in planning and carryingout tests of efficiency for the recruitment of workers.3. It is clear that the limited tuition in domestic work given by Local EducationAuthorities is not adequate to the need for the standard of efficiency required. Itis doubtful whether these Authorities will ever be in a position to cover the wholeground. Training was therefore undertaken by the Institute, designedly to a limited extent, partly as a pilot scheme to indicate what could and should be done and^^partly to meet needs which would not otherwise be met. Contrary to incorrect* statements the cost of training is not comparatively high, averaging between  5and  6 per week per trainee, including the maintenance of the trainee.4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggests that in present conditions the institute should be closed down. In my view this would be a disastrous step totake just at the time when the value of the Institute is being increasingly recognised.Not only would it be regarded as acceptance by the Government of the misinformed40235THIS  DOCUMENT &apos;IS THE   PROPERTY  QF HLS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENT
criticism of the work done by the Institute, but it would create the impression thatthe Government has abandoned all hope of a more satisfactory regulation of theconditions of employment of domestic workers, and that it was no longer concerned about the betterment of the conditions of the large body of domestic workers whoa. h are doing valuable and essential work for the welfare of the community under* &amp; conditions well known to be less favourable than those of the k waiters ;iaindustry generally. It is not unlikely that closure of the Institute will be repre-sented as a further blow against hard-pressed housewives with domestic -responsebilities bordering on hardship. n^i tV\c5.   The cost of the Institute for 1951-52 is estimated at  200,000, of which about half represents the cost of training with 350 workers per week at the centres.A.
