his DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST VSGOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(51) 426TH FEBRUARY, 1951COPY NO.ItCABINETCALL-UP OF RESERVISTSMemorandum by the Minister of DefenceFollowing upon the Prime Minister&apos;s defence statement in the Houseof Commons on 29th January (Cmd.  8146), consideration has been given as amatter of urgency to the scope and form of the necessary legislation to giveeffect in detail to the call-up of reservists set out in that statement.    TheService Ministers and I have discussed certain questions of policy which require urgently to be determined in this connection, and on which I therefore ask the Cabinet to give.decisions.Duration of the Call-up Provisions2. The Prime Minister&apos;s statement did not specify that the call-up of class Z and class G reservists for 15 days training, and of certain other categories of regular or volunteer reserves for longer periods of service,would be limited to 1951.    The Service Departments are anxious that thenecessary powers should be taken to enable similar measures to be adopted in1952 and later, should the situation so require.    I would certainly think itdesirable to have continuing powers of this kind at any rate until, say, 1954,by which time the system of peace-time national service should have built up the reserves to a strength making the recall of class Z and G reservistsno longer necessary.    It is possible that the analogy of the National service act 1948 could be adopted, whereby the new Act might be extended year by year for a limited number of years by Order-in-Council, subject to affirmative resolutions of both Houses of Parliament.3. The Service Ministers and I consider that, if necessary, the sameindividuals should be liable to recall for 15 days training in future years as arerecalled for such training in 1951;   but that any men recalled for the longerperiods (3 months or up to 16 months) should not be recalled again for lengthyperiods of service before 1954 - apart of course from their ordinaryliability to recall in emergency.Medical Examination of Called-up Reservists4. I have already represented to the Service Ministers the desirabilityof the medical examination of the class Z and class G reservists selected for call-up in 1951 being undertaken, if possible, before the men are summoned to join for their 15 days training.    It is of the greatest importance to thesuccess of this scheme, and to the impression left with the reservists them-selves, that the maximum amount of useful military training should be obtainedfrom the 15 days in camp, and all possible measures should be taken to reducethe administrative procedure in the actual camp period with this object in view.I understand that the Ministry of Labour could probably undertake the medical examination through their existing Medical Board machinery, and I hope it maybe possible to arrange for the medical examination of these men to be under- .taken near their homes and at a time convenient to them.   This would largely
21!obviate the recall.among the Z and G reservists of a considerable number of medical officers.    There will be need for incorporating provision in theBill requiring the reservists concerned to report for medical examinationat some time before their actual period of training in camp.Penalties for disregarding Training Notices5, In the paper which the Secretary of State for War circulated(C.P.(51) 26) on 19th January to the Cabinet, he proposed the same &quot;sanctions&quot;as are applicable to national service men when summoned for training during their part-time service:   this provides for a fine up to  25, if tried in a civilcourt, and a maximum sentence of two years&apos; detention or imprisonment iftried by a court-martial.    I think that defaulters should be triable only before a civil court:   but 1 think that the amount of the penalty to which they shouldbe subject should be increased to  25 or one month&apos;s imprisonment.Experience of civil courts handling cases of volunteer members of theTerritorial Army who fail to attend camp without excuse shows that they areapt to be treated with some leniency. .Incitement to Disobey Training Notices6., The related question is how those who may incite reservists todisobey their training notices should be punished.    The Home Secretary is, ofcourse, interested in this question.    There are provisions in the Servicediscipline Acts, e. g. Section 153 of the Army Act which deals with personswho procure or persuade or attempt to procure or persuade any officer orsoldier to desert or absent himself without leave, and which carries fairlysevere penalties (six months or  30).    Such provisions are, however, framedin terms which appear to contemplate rather persons already with the Coloursthan reservists.7. There is also the Incitement to Disaffection Act, 1934, which provides for heavy penalties (two years or  200 on indictment or four months or  20 on summary conviction) against &quot;any person maliciously andadvisedly endeavouring to seduce any member of His Majesty&apos;s forces from, his duty or allegiance to His Majesty&quot;.    This Act also makes it an offence, similarly punishable, to have possession or control of documents ofsuch a nature that their dissemination among members of His Majesty&apos;s forces would be an offence under the Act, and it confers important powers to searchpremises and persons for evidence of the commission of offences.   the attorney-General has considered this Act of 1934, but he is not satisfied that&apos;it can be taken for certain that a court would hold reservists to be &quot;members ofHis Majesty&apos;s Forces&quot; within the meaning of that Act.    He considers that itwould be wise to include in the Bill provisions on the lines of Defence Regulation39A and to render them applicable both to persons with the Colours andto reservists.    This would have the effect both of clearly covering incitement of reservists to disobey training notices without raising a,ny implication that theyare not&apos;members of His Majesty&apos;s Forces&quot;, and also of punishing other forms ofincitement which might be applied either to them or to men serving.   He con-siders that it would be essential to make applicable the provisions of the Act of1934 as to possession or control of documents, and particularly the searchpowers.    The matters which provisions on the lines of Regulation 39A would render punishable are endeavours (i) to seduce reservists or persons servingfrom their duty, (ii) to incite them to evade their duties or to perform their duties otherwise than to the best of their ability, (iii) to incite persons to abstain from enrolling voluntarily, or (iv) to prejudice training, disciplineor administration.
Protection against Dismissal from Employment28. The proposed call-up Bill will contain provisions protecting areservist called up for 15 days training against dismissal from his employment(as distinct from reinstatement in employment in the case of reservistscalled back to the Forces for lengthy periods of service).    This raises thequestion whether the volunteer member of the Auxiliary Forces, with whom the class Z or G reservist would be serving side by side in camp, ought to bebrought within the scope of this protection against dismissal..   The service ministers and I considered this matter last summer in relation to nationalservice reservists who undertake the additional obligations of a normalAuxiliary Force engagement;   but we decided against the extension ofprotection to the national service volunteer because of the difficulties inherent in extending the protection to the ordinary volunteer.    The Service ministers and I have reviewed the matter in the light of the call-up of the Z reservistswho will have this protection, as promised by the Prime Minister &apos;s statement,and we think that the same protection, both as against dismissal from his employer and as to the guarantee of the normal holiday in addition to thetraining period, should be extended to the normal Auxiliary Force volunteerduring his period in camp.9. Another category requiring consideration are the regular reserviststo be called up by the Army and the Air Force for periods of 15 days training,as distinct from recall for long periods of service;   it would seem that a short period of training is not within the scope of the 1950 Reinstatement Actmentioned above, and we think the same protection should be accorded to thesemen.Reinstatement Rights for Regular Reservists10. The Admiralty hope to obtain a good number of officers by volunteeringfrom the Emergency List of the Royal Navy, the R. N. V. R.  and the R. N. V. S. R. ,for a period of 18 months service as an alternative to compulsory powers.    Itseems necessary that such volunteers should be granted the reinstatementrights contemplated for the compulsory recall of reservists under the reinstatement in Civil Employment Act of 1950.    The Air Ministry will also have certain volunteers from other reserves for lengthy periods of service or training similarly affected.General11. While I think that, it is important that the scope of the legislation nowin hand regarding the call-up proposals of the Prime Ministers statement should be related closely to the field covered by that statement, and whileParliament will no doubt scrutinise the Bill or Bills drafted for that purposesomewhat narrowly from that angle, it seems desirable that we should takethe opportunity of this legislation to arm the Service Departments with such powers as are needed over the next three or four years to achieve the generalobject stated by the Prime Minister of making the regular Forces now in being more effective and to facilitate if necessary their more rapid and smoothmobilisation.12. Summarised, the points on which I now ask the Cabinet to decide areas follows:-(1)     Provision should be made in the proposed Bill enabling the service departments to recall for 15 days training, in 1952 and subsequent yearsuntil 1954, the same men who are to be recalled for such training in 1951,and/or other men in the same or other categories of reserves;   provided thatno man recalled for 3 months service or up to 18 months service shall berequired to serve for more than one such term before 1954 (paragraphs 2and 3);
(Z)     Provision should be included in the Bill requiring the reservistsconcerned to report for medical examination at some time before the date of joining in camp, regard being had to the man&apos;s place of residence and convenience (paragraph 4);(3)     The penalty for non-obedience of a training notice should be 25 or one month&apos;s imprisonment and defaulters should be triableonly in a civil court (paragraph 5);(4)    Provision should be included in the Bill, on the lines of defence regulation 3 9A (now lapsed) for dealing with incitement to disobeytraining notices and similar offences (paragraph 7);(5)     Volunteer members of the Auxiliary Forces should be given bythis Bill the same protection, during annual training in camp, as regardsdismissal from employment and the guarantee of the annual holiday, as itis proposed to give to the class Z and class G reservists recalled for 15days training (paragraphs 8 and 9);(6)     Volunteers from the reserves for lengthy periods of service with thNavy and the Air Force should be given the reinstatement rights provided inthe Reinstatement in Civil Employment Act, 1950, for reservists compulsorilrecalled for similar periods (paragraph 10).E.
