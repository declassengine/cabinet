THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC  MA.IESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1951CONFIDENTIALCP. (51) 2117th January, 1951CABINETSERVICE COURTS MARTIALMemorandum by the Minister of defence the Cabinet will remember that, in our memorandum of 24th July (CP. (50)180), the Lord Chancellor and I asked our colleagues to agree to a number of recommendations, arising out of the Reports of the Lewis and Pilcher Committees,for the reform of Courts Martial procedure. The Cabinet accepted the proposalfor the establishment of a Courts Martial Appeal Court and decided that thenecessary legislation should be prepared; but they decided to defer for the time beingreaching a decision on other aspects of Courts Martial procedure (CM. (50) 51stConclusions, Minute 6).2. When the Cabinet considered on 23rd November (CM. (50) 77th Con-clusions, Minute 6) the memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty (CP. (50)275) recommending publication of the First Report of the Committee on theAdministration of Justice under the Naval Discipline Act (the Pilcher Committee),v I was invited to complete my discussions with my Service colleagues on the main recommendations of the Lewis and Pilcher Committees, other than the setting upof *a Courts Martial Appeal Court, and to submit our views to the Cabinet at anearly date.3. Since then, the First Report of the Pilcher Committee has been presented to Parliament as Cmd. 8094, and the Courts Martial (Appeals) Bill was read a first time in the House of Commons on 13th December. I understand that the SecondReading of the Bill will be taken soon after the House resumes this month. Mean-while, Lord Reading has given notice of a motion for Papers to be debated in theHouse of Lords on 6th February, when he will call attention to the Reports of the lewis and Pilcher Committees and ask His Majesty&apos;s Government what action they propose to take upon the recommendations contained in these Reports.4. In view of these forthcoming debates I have discussed with my Servicecolleagues whether, and if so at what stage, the fuller statement of the Govern-ment&apos;s intentions regarding the recommendations in these two Reports, which Ipromised in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 18th September last,* shouldbe made. We reached the conclusion that it would be desirable that such a state-ment should be published, perhaps in the form of a White Paper, but not necessarilyin advance of the Second Reading debate on the Appeals Court Bill, provided thatthe conclusions of the Government in regard to the three major questions which remain unresolved could be included in the statement. The main advantage of leaving publication of this statement or White Paper until after the SecondReading debate on the Appeals Court Bill would be that the Government wouldbe able to take account of any views expressed in the House commanding widesupport not necessarily on Party lines-before committing themselves publiclyon these issues.5. These three outstanding matters, with the views previously expressed in cp. (50) 180, are as follows:-(a) The recommendation of the Lewis Committee that for the more importantArmy and R.A.F. Courts Martial civilian lawyers should preside. This* Hansard, 19th September, 1950, Columns 205-6.39972Copy &quot;No. 3 2
proposal was considered and rejected by the Pilcher Committee so faras Naval Courts Martial are concerned (paragraph 80), and was notfavoured by the official Working Party under Sir Albert Napier (para-graph 59). I agree with the Lord Chancellor and the three service ministers that no change should be made from the existing system andthat the Lewis Committee recommendation should be rejected.I feel sure that public opinion will regard this as reasonable bearing that mind that there will still be an automatic legal review by the judge advocate General and his staff and the Judge Advocate of the Fleet,and that when the Courts Martial (Appeals) Bill becomes law there willbe a final right of appeal (with leave) to an Appeal Court of highstanding.(b) The Lewis Committee (paragraph 125) and a minority of the pilcher committee recommend that unanimity of findings should be substitutedfor the present majority verdict of guilt or innocence.The Lord Chancellor, the Service Ministers and I agree with themajority of the Pilcher Committee (paragraph 129) and with the Inter-Departmental Working Party (paragraph 27) in rejecting this proposal:the legal grounds for it are inconclusive, and there are serious practicalobjections. In particular, unanimity would be unworkable in war.We consider that, if an Appeal Court is set up in addition to the existingsafeguards, public opinion will be satisfied that there is no real risk ofinjustice.We recommend that the existing practice of majority verdicts shouldcontinue.(c) Other rank representation is suggested by Mr. A. R. Blackburn, M.P., amember of the Lewis Committee, but otherwise unanimously opposed by the Lewis Committee (paragraph 240) and Pilcher Committee (para-graph 60) and by the Inter-Departmental Working Party (paragraph 66).The Secretary of State for Air favours this proposal and his views areto some extent shared by the Secretary of State for War. The view ofthe Service authorities, however, with which the rest of us agree, is strongly against such an innovation. In CP. (50) 180 the LordChancellor and 1 accordingly recommended that the proposal for otherrank representation should be rejected, and we adhere to that recom-mendation.6. I hope the Cabinet will now be prepared to endorse these recommenda-tions, and to authorise me to state what is the Governments view if I am pressed to do so during the Second Reading debate on the Appeals Court Bill.7. There are a number of subsidiary recommendations in the two Committees&apos;Reports with which we do not consider it necessary to trouble the Cabinet, buton which Parliament and the Services will with to know the Governments inten-tions. Some of these minor matters have already been implemented by administra-tive action, but others will require legislation by amendment of the Naval discipline act or the Army and Air Force Acts.8. There are a number of amendments to the Naval Discipline Act which,though not strictly consequential upon the institution of a Courts Martial appeal court, should, in the opinion of the Admiralty, be brought into force as soon aspossible after the Appeal Court begins to function. The Admiralty would proposeto bring in a Bill for this purpose during the present session, if possible, and theywould at the same time take the opportunity of amending the Naval Discipline Act(which is not, like the Army and Air Force Acts, subject to an annual amending bill);in a number of ways in which it is now out of date. For various reasons theWai Office and the Air Ministry would propose to defer amendment of the Armyand Air Force Acts, in the few minor respects required by the approved recom-mendations of the Lewis Report (apart from the three major outstanding matters dealt with in paragraph 5 above), until the Annual Bill of 1952. Final agreement has not yet been reached on certain points, and from the draftsman&apos;s point of view it is rather late now to try to include them in the forthcoming Annual Bill.9. The Service Ministers and Tthink that it would be desirable that a draft white Paper should be prepared covering all the recommendations of the Lewis
Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1,11 th January, 1951.and Pilcher Committees, and showing the extent to which decisions have beenreached and what action remains to be taken. I understand that material for thispurpose has already been assembled in the Service Departments. If it should appearfrom the views expressed during the debate on the Bill that a White Paper of thiskind was generally desired, I would propose to announce our intention to publishone; it would in any case be most useful in preparation for the Lords debate on lord Reading&apos;s motion on 6th February. I would accordingly ask for authorityto issue the White Paper, if after consulting with my Service colleagues we thinkit desirable, at the most appropriate moment after the Commons debate.10.   I therefore recommend that the Cabinet should agree as follows:  (a) That we should proceed with the Courts Martial (Appeals) Bill in the formin which it has been introduced in the House of Commons.(b) That the three major questions relating to Courts Martial procedure shouldbe determined as proposed in paragraph 5 above, namely, that thereshould be no change in the form of Courts Martial or in the presentsystem of majority verdicts; and that the proposal for other rankrepresentation on Courts Martial should be rejected, and that theGovernments decisions on these points should, if need be, be announced in the course of the debate on the Second Reading of the Appeals CourtBill.(c) That a draft White Paper should be prepared covering all the recom-mendations of the Lewis and Pilcher Committees, and that I should beauthorised to present it to Parliament at any time after the SecondReading of the Bill if it should appear from the course of the debate that its issue would be desirable.(d) That a Bill to bring up to date the Naval Discipline Act should be intro-duced in the present session if possible; but amendment of the Armyand Air Force Acts can stand over until the 1952 Annual Bill.E.
