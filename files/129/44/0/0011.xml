The main recommendations are:-(i)   that the present ban on the import from the United States oflarge excavators required for 1951-52 delivery should be lifted;   and(ii)   that if opencast production is to continue for the next five years at the maximum rate which is considered practicable it isnecessary that an early announcement should be made.Without these measures plant heeded to secure extra produc-tion this year, and next will not be forthcoming, and the declinein production after 1953 will be very rapid.3. I am sure that we must produce all the opencast coal we canduring the next five years.     Indeed, I can only regret that, so far as canbe foreseen, our limited resources of shallow coal will make it impossibleto avoid some decline in output.     But whatever happens we must not fail,through lack of plant, to win all the workable coal that can be found.4. I attach a draft of an immediate announcement (Annex II).     before it is issued 1 should propose to see representatives of the Federation ofCivil Engineering Contractors, and also of the National Farmers&apos; union and the Central Landowners&apos; Association, and advise them of the Govern-menfs intentions with regard to opencast production.     The terms of theannouncement may, of course, need to be amended in the light of their actions.conclusions therefore ask the Cabinet to agree:-(i)   that the opencast programme for the next five years should beincreased, as proposed, to 50 million tons;(ii)   that an announcement to this effect, on the lines of Annex II,should be made immediately;
(iii) that the present ban on the import of United Statesexcavators should be lifted, as proposed;   and(iv) that I should explain these proposals to representativesof the interests concerned (Federation of civil engineering Contractors, etc. ) at an early date.F.J.N.-B.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W.1,12TH JANUARY, 1951.5*
ANNEX IOFFICIAL CO.iL COM IT TEEThird Report by the Working Party on Opencast CoalProduction1. On present plans, as the Minister of Fuel and Power informed the Cabinet on 3rd November, opencast production would decline over thenext five years from 12 million tons in 1951 to 2 million in 1955.2. In view of the revised and reduced estimates which have nowbeen made of deep-mined output over, the same period, we were asked to review the possibility of a bigger opencast programme.      Our review is now submitted (Appendix)-and for the reasons given therein, we think that themaximum practicable programme, compared with the existing programme wouldbe as follows:-million tonsOriginal new programme Programme Increase1951	12	12*&apos;	1 ?.1952	10	Hi	1953	9	10	11954	4	8	41955	2	7	53. To secure this new programme the following measures would benecessary:(i) An early announcement of the Government&apos;s intention to continueopencast production on this scale.      This is essential if opencastcoal contractors and plant manufacturers are to be able to planahead to produce the coal.(ii) Lifting of the present ban on the import from the U.S. of largeexcavators and other plant required for 1951/52 delivery.    The new programme can only be achieved with additional plant some %f whichwill not be available from the U.K. for at least two years..  The costof such U.S. plant as is essential and can be delivered in time is unlikely to exceed 5 million dollars.        The precise amount of new plant required and the incidence of the demand can in the firstinstance best be judged by the contractors themselves in the lightof the announced programme and their detailed knowledge of the.condition of their own plant.      iifter the -announcement of the extended programme, importing agents should therefore be advisedwithout undue publicity that applications for import licences will again be considered.(iii) The amount and phasing of such plant imports to be carefully consideredby the Import Licensing Committee so as to take account of plans todevelop British production.
(iv) Consideration of importing plant on Government account and placinggovernment.orders as a means of securing the necessary expansionof British capacity to be deferred until an announcement has beenmade about the future of opencast and the reactions ,of contractors and plant manufacturers are known.(v) The acceptance, if found necessary, in future years of some loss on opencast production, since the new programme will only beachieved by full exploitation of practically every reasonablyworkable site found in future. It is important, however,  thatin any announcement about the future, attention should not bedrawn.to this possibility.     Details of the revised financialauthority will be worked out between the Treasury and the Ministryof Fuel and Power.4. Ministers should, however, be warned that the announcement that opencast coal working is to be continued on a substantial scalebeyond 1953, will be strongly disliked in certain quarters; and theopposition to proposals to prospect or work, may be expected to increase as more and more land, of agricultural and amenity importance is involved.(sgd:    D.P.

4 0APPEKDIXOPENCAST GOAL programme^E :    1-951 - 55 AND BEYONDI.    How much outcrop coal is there?I. Present reserves, in order of availability, are;-rnillion tons(i). Remaining to be won under current&apos; contracts 18(ii) Definitely available but deferred for short periods for agricultural and other reasons or (in the caseof anthracite) to sustain a 5 - year programme 3(iii) Almost certainly available, but in various stages of consideration, interdepartmental clearance andcontract action 6(iv) Probably available, but not yet fully prospected 8(v) Unprospected, but, by geological inference,probably remaining 35 - 50(vi) Partly or fully prospected but probably notavailable because of operational difficulties,excessively poor quality, danger to collieryworkings, and, to a snail extent, amenity,agricultural, housing and other objections 20 - 25TOTAL:      say,      1002.. Ihe figure of 35 - 50 million unprospected but suitable foropencast working is, of course,  a guess;     but in the light of eightyears1 experience the lower figure is thought to be a safe one.II. How quickly can it be won, plant capacity permitting? , .3. The answer depends on how quickly resources in categories(ii) - (vi) above can be brought forward into category (i).Category (ii)4. More than half is anthracite.      Because anthracite production from the mines cannot be increased for some years,  the opencastprogramme aims at a steady output of 1 million tons of anthracite a year for another five years, and new anthracite contracts are being phasedaccordingly.5. For the rest,- most is coal in extensions to existing siteswhich cannot be worked until the site now working is completed.6. There remains only a small tonnage deferred for agriculturalreasons.    It will be let within the next year and could not, in theparticular circumstances of the case, now be let earlier without over-loading screening capacity in the area concerned.Category (iii)7. This coal has been fully prospected, but doubts about qualityhave to be resolved (with N.C.B.) and site plans have to be prepared showingthe precise fields it is proposed to dig up, the position of spoil banks,etc. before clearance can be applied for.      Of the 6 million, about 1.2 millionare in this stage.
4.108. Then follows the period of consideration and discussion withother interested Departments.     Sites are &quot;trimmed&quot; to leave, say, a beltof trees or the home paddock, and many other conditions are settled beforeclearance is given.     Another 1.2 million are in this stage.9.  - Finally, revised plans of the site as cleared have to beprepared, special claused embodying all the clearance conditions drafted,and complete sets of geological reports, drawings and other contractdocuments have to be sent out f-md considered by tenderers before&apos; a contract is let.      -^bout 3is&quot; million -:ure in this stage.10. Although, by an intensive effort on the part of all concerned -such as is being made this winter - the period occupied by these processes can be shortened, the processes are not simple ones and cannot .be rushed.       The most that can be expected from this winter&apos;s effort to shorten the &quot;pipeline&quot; is a small and non-recurring spurt.     Indeed,unless the accelerated pace of clearance and contract letting is maintained,the spurt will merely be at the expense of a corresponding slump later on as the &quot;pipeline&quot; reverts to its previous length.Categories (iv) and (v)11. A site is not fully prospected until it has been so thoroughlydrilled and pitted as    to show, within narrow margins of error -(a) how thick the seams are and at what depth and dip;(b) how many cubic yards of overburden must be excavated for eachton of coal and what is the nature of the overburden;(c) the precise quantity and quality of the coal and its probablemarket value;(d) many other details,  such as the position of faults, incidence of old workings, etc.12, Prospecting,  therefore, starts by throwing the net wideand proceeds by stages to bring particularly promising areas into eversharper focus.       4t an intermediate stage some apparently insuperableobjections to working may loom up, in which case the potential site maybe relegated to Category (vi) before prospecting is fully completed.More commonly because the other interests concerned must know precisely what fields it is proposed to dig up before they can determine theirattitude to the project, prospecting proceeds to the.final stage of veryprecise knowledge about a particular site before clearance machinery is set in motion.13. The following are the sums spent on prospecting and the tonnagefully proved in the last three years:-Year Expenditure Tonnage Proved &apos;000s. (million tons)1948 1,009 - 19.21949 1,006 16.91950 (Estcl.) 920 11.014. Evidently the return is a diminishing one as the &quot;easy&quot; coalhas been exhausted and if the tonnage proved is even to be maintained fora short period, the prospecting effort will have to be increased.    Butthere is keen competition for qualified geologists and they must, in anycase, be trained for at least six months on opencast work before they areof much use.
15. Consequently, although the Ministry of Fuel and Power areaiming to increase their prospecting staff by about 25 per cent in thenext six months, and to develop the faster geophysical methods whichare now in their infancy, it seems unlikely that the present rate ofproving coal can be increased during the next&quot;year or so.    Indeed a greateffort will be needed to maintain it, and a progressive decline willprobably become unavoidable within the next two or three years.Category (vi)16.   ..- It is tempting to think that it should be practicable, in*rder to boost production during the next fey/ years, to supplement the yield from prospecting by drawing heavily on this &quot;reserve&quot; if 20 - 25million tons of more or less fully prospected coal which has from timeto time been put on one side for what have appeared to be compellingreasons.    But this &quot;reserve&quot; is very largely illusory.17. . In the early days of opencast, prospectors were sent forthto find coal with very little guidance as to practical limitations onits workings.      Indeed, the capabilities of the plant which might become available were not precisely known and liaison with the old collierycompanies and marketing organisations was rudimentary.   .As a consequenceover 10 million tons of the coal in category (vi) is in excessively deepand otherwise awkward sites and sites remote from any railhead or centre*f consumption.    To work such sites would involve the excavation of very large quantities *f overburden for relatively little return in coal and, so l*ng as there is any reasonable prospect of its being used tobetter advantage elsewhere, would constitute a gross misuse of plant aswell as being very costly.      The immediate effect of bringing such sit^s* into the programme vrould probably be to reduce output.13. Another 7 million tons of very inferior coal, have beenproved.      The quality is so bad (generally due to excessive sulphur orash) that even in conditions of acute shortage the outlets for such coalare strictly limited.19. ^gain, over 3 million tons has been partly or fullyprospected which can never be worked during the lifetime of existingcollieries working nearby seams.      Where the safety of mines isconcerned, risks cannot be taken.20. Finally, there is over 4 million tons of proved coal whichis the subject of strong objections on amenity, agricultural, housing orother grounds, and which was dealt with in our Second Report.   Much of.  this consists of parts of sites abandoned as a quid pro quo for clearancebeing given for the part which h.j.s bucn worked, or is now working.&apos; o go back now and dig up large areas to get tl-ese odd parcels of coal would not only arouse the bitterest opposition from the farmers and othersdispossessed for a. second time in a. few years, but would, again, be amisuse of plant in present circumstances.      There are therefore only about two million tons remaining in sites which, from the opencast point of view,are satisfactory but to the. working of which ths re are very strong objections from the amenity,  agricultural, housing or other standpoints.A number of such cases (of which details were given in our oeco^d Report)have been considered by the forking Party and we then concluded that they all have one thing in common;    they could only be worked at tne cost ofexacerbating - probably to a quite disproportionate extent - the presenthostility of the public towards opencast.     This hostility can be verycontagious.        The outcray against opencast in &quot;.7orcestershire has evokedsympathetic reactions in other counties where opinion had seemed to be reconciled to opencast, and it is at least questionable whether the workingof these sites,  to which there are certainly strong objections, would on balance benefit the opencast programme.21.To sum up at this stage;-
(a) The benefits to be anticipated from shortening the time taken to clear sites and let contracts - and keeping it short - and from afinal comb out of the 20 - 25 million tons&quot;in abeyance are relatively small.(b) While the tonnage of accessible outcrop coal not yet let to contract is of the order of 50 - 60 million,  the rate at whichit can be won is primarily dependent on the rate of prospecting.(c) The annual return from prospecting has been falling rapidly,since 1948.     The real decline is less than would appear from thefigures because those for earlier years included too high a proportion   of unworkable coal;      nevertheless, the decline is serious and reflects the inherently greater difficulty of finding workable coal as time goes on.      It is unlikely that,even with the greatest practicable increase in the prospectingeffort, it will be possible to maintain the present rate of finding suitable coal for more than -another year or so.(d) We conclude that the maximum production programme which is practicable would be of the following order of magnitude(figures, in million tons)1951        1952        1953        1954       1955        1956-60 (if needed)12J 111 10 8 7 about 30III. Plant Capacity22. The main items of plant concerned are:-(a) Large excavators used as draglines or as&quot; shovels  (with dumptrucks) for the main excavation of overburden.(b) Dump trucks(c) Large (Class I) tractors used with a variety of ancillary tools(d) SmaiLl shovels used for coal digging.23. The replacement demand for items (b) and (d) will be met from British Production.     The same should be true of item (c) from1952 onwards when the Vickers tractor is expected to be in quantityproduction.    But in the meantime, coal contractors are in urgent need of Class I tractors which can only be supplied - if at all - from theU.S.24. The most important and costly item is, however, the largeexcavator.      In the course of the next ten years all but a negligibleproportion of the fleet now working 100 hours a week on opencast will be completely yrorn out.     What cannot be estimated with any precision is what proportion will remain capable of reasonably economic working at various intervals during that period.      It depends, of course, on theage distribution of the present fleet but very much more on how it is used and maintained by some 30 or so contracting firms with vastlydifferent standards of plant maintenance.      While, therefore,  the incidence of wastage may vary appreciably from year to year,  the averagecan hardly be less than 10 per cent per annum.25. On this basis and starting from the reasonable assumptionthat, fully employed and with rather less rainfall, existing capacitywould have produced the target figure of 13 million tons in 1950, theextent of the probable deficiency in&apos; large excasrator capacity is asfollows.
Maximum programme in terms of Potential l*ssYear due to plant	Site Availability	Plant Capacity	deficiency	(1)    .	(2)	(3)	M. tens	M. tons	M. tans1950	13.0	13.0	-1951	12.5	11.7	.81952	11.5	10.4	1.11953	10.0	9.1	.91954	8.0	7.8	.21955	7.0	6.5	.51956)			to )	30.0	13.0	17.0i960)			In view of the age distribution of existing plant capacity (of which more than half is less than 5 years eld) the deficiency may be lessthan shown in the earlier years when we should have to spend dollars to remedy it. On the other hand,  should prospecting to better than is assumed in Column (1)  (which is possible) cr should the run down inplant capacity exceed the 10 per cent per annum assumed in Column (2)(as it well may), the loss of coal might be much greater.     And ifmaximum production is still required after 1955,  the need for new plantwill be greatly increased.26. There is some possibility that a part of this need for morelarge excavators may be met from U.K. production starting in about twoyears&apos;  time.      On the other hand,  to the extent that it i?   met in themeantime by imports from the U.S., the plans now being made to expandU.K. production may be compromised.       Y/hile, therefore, we recommend* that the present ban on the importation of large excavators for opencastshould be lifted,  the quantity and timing of such imports will need to be carefully considered by the Import Licensing Committee. TheChancellor of the Exchequer has already agreed in correspondence with theMinister of Fuel and Power that he is agreeable to the lifting of the banbeing raised orally at the Production Committee, since that Committeeimposed it, without prejudice to determination of requirements in detailsubsequently.IV. Cost27. ffe have considered Y/hether departure from the no loss basisof opencast production would be likely to result in increased output andhave come to the conclusion that it would probably not do so immediately,but will almost certainly be necessary in order to secure maximum production,over the next two or three years, unless increased c^itsare covered by increases in the pithead prices of deep mined coal of similar grades.28. Because coal seams dip from the outcrop, there is generallya choice between a reasonable sized and economical site, or alternatively,going to greater depth and v/orking a larger site.       But   if the largersite is chosen it means, of course,  that the ratio of overburden to coalwill be higher.      A greater amount of plant will therefore be required tomaintain the same rate of coal output throughout the life of the sie and the cost will be higher.      The average ratio of overburden to coal isnow about 10 : 1.     By working all sites to greater depth, it might easilybecome 10-g- : 1.      The effect would be to bring into use the small margin of plant now idle.       But it would not increase the&apos; rate of coal outputbecause the extra plant would be digging overburden, not coal.29. The advantage of working sites to greater depth and at greater erst&quot;in both money and plant use is not, therefore, an immediategain in output - indeed there may be some loss - but the fact that coal
resources are thereby conserved and higher rates of output can bemaintained in future years without finding so many new sites.    thus the further ahead the opencast.programme is planned the more importantit becomes to work sites to maximum depth so as to conserve other sites for future Y/orking,     There is little doubt that, in view of the uncertainyield of future prospecting, and the need for production to go on longer than has hitherto been envisaged, greater weight must be given to getting the maximum out of each site even though such a policy may, in due course,involve some loss on opencast working.     Whether such loss, if it develops,should remain with the Exchequer or be passed on in some way to theconsumer would be for consideration in due course.30. But because the bulk of the 1951 production will come fromsites already working, the effect on production costs of going to greaterdepth and higher ratios on new sites will be very gradual and may be offset by other factors.      There is, therefo.ro, no urgency about thequestion of departing from the no loss basis of production but it shouldbe recognised that an extended programme may make it impossible to avoidincurring some small loss in later years.     The knowledge that theGovernment were prepared to contemplate this possibility would, however,be likely to have an immediate and adverse effect on prices quoted bycontractors to the Ministry of Fuel and Power and it is therefore important that no indication of a change in financial policy should beincluded in any announcement about the future opencast programme.V. Procedure31. -^11 aspects of opencast operations - prospecting, plantprocurement, restoration policy and, above all, cost - have in the pastsuffered from the short term view inseparable from the conception of$opencast as the marginal producer which must absorb the full effects of changes in supply and demand figures some twenty times bigger thanthe opencast contribution.     In the interests of economy and soundplanning by all concerned, it is therefore desirable that the programme should be framed as far ahead as is practicable; and that, having been so framed, opencast production should be regarded as an integral partof the country&apos;s coal supplies for the period of the programme.      Wetherefore recommend that if the Government, on the basis of the figures given in paragraph 21(d) above, decide to continue the opencast programmebeyond 1953, an early announcement of their intentions should be made.32. Such an announcement would provide a firm basis on whichopencast contractors could plan investment in new plant and would encourage the expansion of U.K. manufacturing capacity to meet the demand.    There    isa good prospect that, in such circumstances, the contractors would themselvesbe prepared to place immediate firm orders for such additional plant as needs to be imported or can be obtained within the next two years.    They are,indeed, in the best position to  assess the probable incidence of wastageyear by year in their own fleets.      It is probable also that, providedimports were not excessive,  such an announcement would provide all the encouragement that is necessary to ensure that plant requirements are fullymet from U.K. production from- 1953 onwards.     We therefore recommend that the related questions of importing excavators on Government account and of placingovernment orders with U.K. makers (as a means of securing the necessaryexpansion in U.K. capacity) should be deferred until the reactions ofopencast contractors and plant makers to the proposed announcement are known.
Proposed- Announcement about the Future Opencast Coal programme in view of the difficulty v/hich is bound to be experienced over at least the next five years in meeting thecoal requirements of the country both internally and forexport, the Minister of Fuel and Power lias had the futureOpencast Production programme under review.     The present programme announced a year ago, provides for an output of some40 million tons during the period 1949 to 1952.     It is becoming more and. more evident, however, that it will not be possible by the end of that period to dispense with the supplies nowobtained by opencast methods.     In addition, in order toenable the contractors to plan ahead, it is desirable that any extension of the programme contemplated should be announcedas soon as possible.The Minister has accordingly decided, after consultationwith his colleagues, that it will be. necessary to extend thepresent programme.     During the next five years the aim mustbe to maintain production at the highest practicable rate andit is hoped that during this period opencast output will be atleast 50 million tons, declining from between 12 to 15 million tons in 1951 to about 7 or 6 million tons in 1955.
