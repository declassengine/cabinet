;THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT[secret;P.(51) 12 COPY NO.    $213TH JANUARY, 1951CABINETCOALMINERS:   PROPOSAL TO RELEASE VOLUNTEERSFROM THE ARMED forces memorandum by the Minister of defence i understand that the Official Coal Committee have considered thememorandum attached to C.P,(51) 6 and that - the Ministry of Fuel and power dissenting - they have serious misgivings about the probable effectof the scheme for withdrawing volunteers from the Forces.2. I share the Official Committee&apos;s misgivings.    I believe a scheme on the lines suggested by the Minister of Fuel and Power would do little tohelp the coal output. It could certainly damage irreparably the recruitingprogramme for the Armed Forces.3. Recruitment of regulars is the foundation of all our defence preparations.     We have taken immense pains to stimulate regular recruit-ment and since the recent pay increases we have had a marked degree ofsuccess.    But 1951 is a year of heavy exits of regulars from the Forces.Despite all our efforts we expect no improvement in the strength of theRegular Army in the coming year.     It is surely unthinkable that - at sucha time as the present - we should aggravate this situation by undertaking a measure of recruitment in reverse, which is what the Minister of fuel and Power&apos;s proposal amounts toi4. The Korean emergency has already forced us to take a number ofquite exceptional steps to increase the strength of the Forces.     We have extended national service to two years.     We have recalled many regularreservists.    We are compulsorily retaining time-expired regulars afterthe end of their service.     These measures, which will continue throughoutthis year at least, have been cheerfully accepted in spite of all the sacrificesthey involved.    But I do not see how the situation can be held if we simultane-ously release men who have recently volunteered for the Forces.     TheCabinet will shortly be considering the measures to increase our defencepreparedness foreshadowed by the Foreign Secretary at the Brussels con-ference.     This new programme, which will attract world-wide attention,will call for many sacrifices.    Among other things, we are being pressuredby the Chiefs of Staff to call up a considerable number of Class Z reservistsfor training, and while no decision has been taken about this, it is an indica-tion of the sort of demands we shall have to make on the nation.     Our success in persuading the nation of the necessity for these measures will depend on whether the right climate of opinion is created in the country.    I submit thatif the Minister&apos;s proposal is accepted and we decide to encourage certain mento leave the Forces, we cannot expect the country to understand the gravity of the defence position.     We cannot at one and the same time persuade thecountry that it is necessary for men to join the Forces and that it isnecessary for them to leave the Forces.
5. I do not for a moment underrate the gravity of the coal situation.   I would remind the Cabinet that I have already, with the gravest misgivings, undertaken to help the mining industry by discon-tinuing recruiting in mining areas and generally discouraging recruitingamong miners.    In doing so the Service Departments have made a generous contribution.    No similar steps have been taken, so far as Iam aware, in other sections of the community.E.S.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1,13TH JANUARY, 1951.
