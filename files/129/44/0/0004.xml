(51) 45 th January, 1951CABINETCOCOS ISLANDSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretaryof State for Commonwealth relations in a telegram of 24th August, printed as an annex to this memorandum, theAustralian Acting Prime Minister suggested to the Prime Minister of the UnitedKingdom that administrative responsibility for the Cocos Islands be transferred from the United Kingdom to Australia. In the following paragraphs we set outthe background to this proposal and recommend its acceptance in principle byHis Majesty&apos;s Government, subject to certain reservations. We invite the Cabinetto endorse the recommendations contained in paragraphs 19 and 20 of this paper.Historical Review2. The Cocos, or Keeling, Islands consist of two small groups of low coralatolls, 15 miles apart, situated in the Indian Ocean about 600 miles South-West ofJava Head and almost mid-way between Ceylon and Perth in Western Australia.They were discovered by Captain William Keeling of the East India Company in1609 but remained uninhabited until 1825 when an Englishman, Alexander Hare,mth some Malay followers, arrived to settle on the Southern or main group.3. The Islands were declared a British possession in 1857, and from 1878 to1886 were under the control of the Governor of Ceylon. In 1886, a freehold lease of the whole territory in perpetuity was granted to George Clunies-Ross and his successors with the provision that the Crown could resume possession without compensation (except for damage to crops, &amp;c.) for any public purpose: thisprovision was, in fact, invoked during the war when the R.A.F. constructed an air-strip on West Island. In the same year the Islands were placed under thecontrol of the Governor of the Straits Settlements. In 1903 they were formallyannexed to the Straits Settlements and incorporated in the Settlement of singapore and thenceforward until the present day they have been administered by theGovernment at Singapore (excluding the years when Singapore was occupied bythe Japanese). The Islands now form part of the Colony of Singapore and the singapore Government maintains an administrative officer on the Islands, thoughuntil the war the head of the Clunies-Ross family acted in this capacity. Theresponsibility of the family is now confined to the management of the estate.Population and Economy4. The population in 1949 consisted of 16 Europeans, 10 Chinese, 1 indian and 1,736 Malays, most of whom are employed in the copra industry and fishing.Pigs, sheep and poultry are kept on the Islands, but the settlement has never beenself-supporting in food, and the only export is copra. The territory is a financialliability to the Colony of Singapore.Strategic Importance5. In 1901 Direction Island (to the North of the main group) became animportant relay in the imperial cable communications system and in 1940 a NavalWireless Station was established. During the war the harbourage was used for flying boats, and in 1945 a 2,500 yard air-strip was constructed for use by heavy bombers of the R.A.F., This air-strip was used by the R.A.F. only untilCopy No.^
1946 and in 1948, following a proposal from the Governor of Singapore that itshould be replanted with coconuts, the South African and Australian governments were consulted as to whether they had any interest in its retention. South Africareplied in the negative, but the Australian Defence Department considered that the;air-strip should be retained as it was an important air link in an alternative route1between the United Kingdom and Australia which, in time of emergency, might become of great strategic importance.     &apos; -ix^i f:;r-&apos;*6. The Chiefs of Staff have examined the question of the strategic importanceof the air-strip and are of the opinion that its development to international standardswould make the Cocos Islands a potentially valuable Allied base for the opera-tion of aircraft and flying boats in support of a campaign in South-East Asia, aswell as opening up a valuable alternative link in imperial communications. How-ever, the Chiefs of Staff have not been able, on strategic grounds alone, to recom-mend the expenditure of United Kingdom funds or resources on the maintenance ordevelopment of the air-strip in peace.7. On the other hand the Cocos group is already in the Australia, NewZealand and Malaya region of strategic responsibility for planning purposes and a relatively minor adjustment of the existing boundary between the Far East andthe Australian naval station would make its defence a direct responsibility ofAustralia. The Chiefs of Staff find no objection to such an arrangement from thedefence point of view and, in fact, if Australian development of the base is contiri-gent on transfer of administrative as well as defence responsibility, they are infavour of the proposal, provided that the control and operation of the NavalWireless Station remains undisturbed.Australian Interest in the Cocos8. In 1948 the Australian Government began to show interest in the air-strip as a staging point in a civil air service which they contemplated establishingbetween Australia and South Africa, and later that year Qantas Empire Airwaysmade a survey flight over the route as a result of which it was decided that theservice was practicable if the air-strip could be improved to international standards.9. In April 1949, when Mr. Chifley was in London for the commonwealth prime Ministers&apos; meeting, he mentioned that it had been suggested to him that australia should buy the Cocos Islands from the United Kingdom, but that he had put the suggestion aside owing to anticipated objections from Singapore, India,Pakistan and Ceylon. He indicated that Australia would be willing to undertake the necessary improvements to the air-strip, but enquired whether we would be willing to finance either the whole or part of these improvements on civil aviationor defence grounds. The answer subsequently given was that we could not on these grounds justify the expenditure of United Kingdom funds but that we should,subject to certain reservations affecting the use of the airfield for civil aviation (seetelegram annexed) be prepared to allow Australia to take over and improve theair-strip for an agreed period in time of pC3.CC, tltl d suggested that the Australiansshould negotiate a lease of the land with the Clunies-Ross family. It is in reply tothis that the Australian Government have put forward their proposal for the com-plete transfer of the islands on the grounds that the limited control to be concededthem was scarcely commensurate with the substantial expenditure in which theywould be involved for improving the air-strip (a capital outlay of approximately 500,000 plus annual expenditure of over  50,000).n .1 ;    -International Implications of the Australian Proposal10. Preliminary enquiries from the United Kingdom High Commissioners atDelhi, Karachi and Colombo indicate that India would almost certainly view withdisfavour any proposal to transfer the Cocos Islands from the United Kingdom toAustralia, that Ceylon would follow the lead given by the Indian Government andthat Pakistani anti-colonial views would similarly lead her to oppose such aproposal. It is not suggested that any Of these Governments would make a major issue of the transfer.&quot;11. . In view of the Australian interest in Dutch New Guinea, Indonesia might take umbrage at any extension of Australian control over territory adjacent to herarid both India arid Pakistan, might well support Indonesia in this attitude. It isriot suggested, however;&apos; that Iridoriesian reaction should be regarded as a deter-mining factor in this matter. ? 3
Local Implications of the Australian Proposal12. We have an obligation to the population of the Islands, which is pre-dominantly Malay. The Governor of Singapore considers that the inhabitantsWould eventually resent being transferred to Australian jurisdiction but that no useful purpose could be served by consulting them as they are not sufficientlyworldly to appreciate in advance the significance of the change. It is, however, thepresent intention to resettle in North Borneo all who wish to emigrate and it isthought unlikely that more than 200 of the 1,700 would wish to remain. The move-ment to North Borneo has already started. If necessary indentured labour couldreplace the emigrants.13. Approval of the transfer by the Singapore Legislative Council would benecessary, since the Ordinance providing for theadministration of the Islands wouldrequire to be repealed. The Governor and the Commissioner-General consider thatit is most important that unofficial consultations with the Members of LegislativeCouncil should take place before any firm proposal is put to the Australian Govern-ment. The attitude of Members of the Singapore Legislative Council may beaffected not only by general political considerations but by the fear that an inter-national airport on Cocos might eventually attract traffic away from Singapore.The authorities in Singapore do not consider that Cocos is ever likely to do this,but it is suggested that the Australians should be asked to give assurances that fulloperating rights would be accorded to B.O.A.C. and Colonial Air Lines without question, if required, and that the United Kingdom Government and the Govern-ment of Singapore would be consulted on any proposal to grant rights to foreignoperators. The Governor expects, however, that it may not be easy to convincepublic opinion in Singapore and Unofficial Members of the Legislative Council thatthe transfer would not be disadvantageous to Singapore&apos;s interests.The Position of the Clunies-Ross Family14. We also have certain obligations to the Clunies-Ross family who hold a lease of the islands in perpetuity. The Australian Government have been in pre-liminary negotiation with the Trustees regarding the lease of the air-strip. these negotiations had reached the stage in May last when a rental of  11,000 per yearhad been proposed by the solicitors of the Clunies-Ross family as a basis of dis-cussion. The negotiations have not been resumed since May and Mr. E. J. Harrison,the Australian Resident Minister in London, has expressed the hope that transfer ofthe Islands to Australia would not be in any way dependent on a decision on the australians&apos; part to resume negotiations with the Clunies-Ross family in the nearfuture. However, we consider it important that any transfer should be effected insuch a way as not to prejudice the Clunies-Ross interests.Other Considerations15. The United Kingdom Government have already conceded an Australianrequest for the transfer to them of our share in the New Hebrides Condominium tothe extent that we have already sought French agreement to this proposal. If weconcede the present request, we shall offer a precedent which might lead, not only toa request for Christmas Island, but possibly also for the British Solomon Islands.16. The question of a transfer of sovereignty in the strict legal sense does not of course arise, since even if the administration wore transferred to. Australia,sovereignty would remain in the Crown, and such things as the method of govern-ment and the administration of justice would remain virtually unchanged. Such a transfer is a very different thing from cession to a foreign Power. It is less open to criticism at home and it offers abroad no dangerous precedent for the use of foreignclaimants to our territories.17. We have considered whether some compromise whereby a greater measureof control could be given to Australia without surrendering the administration ofthe group would be feasible. We have also considered the possibility of transferringto Australia only the island in the group upon which the air-strip is situated. How-ever, the Governor of Singapore considers that, provided that the bulk of thepopulation is first allowed to emigrate, it would be. preferable for the whole group to be transferred as innumerable complications would arise from the existence oftwo Administrations in so small a territory.
18. We assume that, in accordance with the terms of the CommonwealthTelegraphs Agreement of 11th May, 1948, the Overseas Telecommunications Corn-mission (Australia) will acquire Cable and Wireless, Ltd.&apos;s, interests in the CableRelay Station on Direction Island, at an agreed price.Conclusions19. Provided that satisfactory arrangements are made to protect the interestsof the present population and of the Clunies-Ross family, we consider that theimportant consideration is to ensure the development of the air-strip to internationalstandards, and we do not regard the difficulties referred to in paragraphs 12 to 15as determining factors in this matter. We think that there is great force in theAustralian reluctance to incur substantial expenditure on an airport in the CocosIslands under the conditions that were laid down in 1949. We have consideredthe two compromise proposals in paragraph 17, and our conclusion is that neither of these alternatives would be practicable. We recommend, therefore, that subjectto the conditions mentioned below, the Australian Government should be informedthat we are prepared to consider their suggestion that Australia might assume a wider responsibility for the Islands.20.   The conditions are that:  (a) Satisfactory arrangements should be made for the continuation of thetransfer of such of the Malay population to North Borneo as may desireit. It would be desirable and may even be necessary for this movementto have been completed before the change of administration takes place.The Australians should be asked to agree to this and to facilitate this transfer of population. .(b) The interests of the Clunies-Ross family should be safeguarded.  In par-ticular, the Australian Government should be asked to agree to arbitration should private negotiations fail to determine a fair rent tobe paid to the Clunies-Ross estate for the land which would otherwise be cultivated.(c) The Unofficial Members of the Singapore Legislative Council should be consulted, and the Clunies-Ross Estate informed, in confidence, before a reply is given to the Australian Governments request for transfer.(d) The control and operation of the Naval Wireless Station should remainundisturbed (see paragraph 7).J. G.P. C. G.-W.5th January. 1951.annex copy of Telegram No. 185 of 24th August, 1950, from the Acting PrimeMinister of Australia to the Prime Minister of the United KingdomCocos IslandsYou will recall that when Mr. Chifley was in London in May of last year heraised with the United Kingdom Government the question of the future of theair-strip on the Cocos Islands, the use of which the Australian Government wascontemplating in connection with a proposed new air route between Australia andSouth Africa. The United Kingdom High Commissioner in Canberra, under cover of a note dated 21st June, 1949, intimated that the United Kingdom Governmentwaa prepared to agree to an arrangement which would concede to the australian government for an agreed period the entire operation and administration of the airfield in time of peace, but drew attention to the following reservations:  (a) The Cocos Islands would continue to be part of the colony of Singaporefor all purposes, i.e., &quot; United Kingdom territory &quot; for purposes of theChicago Convention, and the grant of rights to foreign operators to
, &apos;, operate through the Cocos, would remain the concern, of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom in consultation with the Govern?inent of Singapore; His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United kingdom would not grant rights in Cocos without consulting the australian government as well as the Government of Singapore.(b) The Cocos Islands would also, for the. same reasons, remain subject to theprovisions of the colonial air navigation orders and the legal authority&apos; of the airfield (e.g., in matters such as the imposition of landing fees,the enforcement of air navigation regulations, &amp;c) would derive from!     1       the authority vested in the Governor of Singapore under these orders.The Australian Government has prepared some estimates of the costs ofrepairing and maintaining an airfield at Cocos and it has also made some approachesfor a lease to the trustees of the Clunies-Ross estate in whom the fee simple of the islands is vested. Should a lease be obtained and the route developed, the australian government might be involved in a capital outlay of approximately  500,000 plusannual expenditure of over  50,000. I feel that the limited nature of Australiancontrol which you would be willing to concede should we decide to proceed withthe investment required to re-establish the air-strip scarcely corresponds with the substantial nature of this investment. In the circumstances it would be appreciatedif the statement of your Government^ position as conveyed by your HighCommissioner on 21st June, 1949, might be reconsidered. The Australian Govern-ment is prepared to contemplate assuming a wider measure of responsibility for a group of islands which are of considerable strategic importance to our country.In fact, the most satisfactory solution from our point of view might well be thetransfer of sovereignty over these islands to Australia.I should be glad if you could reconsider this question from the widest aspectsof British Commonwealth defence and development and inform us Whether theUnited Kingdom Government would be prepared to enter discussions with a viewto a possible change in status of the group.
