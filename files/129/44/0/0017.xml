72iTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(51), 17 COPY NO. $216TH JANUARY, 1951CABINETBALANCE OF CIVIL pay memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in CP.(51) 2 the Minister of Defence sets out his reasons for believing that balance of civil pay should be retained for civil servants.2. I agree that, as he says, settled policy should not be changedwithout good reason.     But the question of balance of civil pay for the1939-45 war was not investigated in any detail and it is possible that, ifit had been so investigated, a different conclusion might have beenreached.3. The Minister of Defence says that the main result of the great improvement in Service pay since the matter was last considered (in1939) is to reduce the cost of balance of civil pay.     But it has the same effect on the cost of National Service Grants.     Moreover, the increasesgiven in September, 1950, as an inducement to volunteers to undertake orextend regular engagements are not necessarily in point.    They were not extended to National Service conscripts and the rates to be paid to con-scripts in a future war, or to reservists in need of further training, have yet to be decided.4. The Minister of Defence suggests that a great many other employers would continue present practice even if the Government wereto change its policy, with the result that the Government standards v/ouldfall below those of the good employer.     I should argue that many private employers might well review their policy in the light of any revised scheme for National Service Grants which the Government might adopt.And, while it is true that our proposals would put those who move fromthe Civil Service to the Armed Forces in a less advantageous position,the extent of this would be mitigated by the improved National ServiceGrants scheme.     Moreover, we surely have to consider not simplywhether the previous custom was beneficial for the Civil Service, but whether it is fair for the population as a whole.5. The Minister of Defence criticises the figure of  500 as amaximum grant to be made under the scheme and suggests that if theNational Service Grants system were fully extended, its cost, and thatof the organisation which it would be necessary to set up to administerit, would be so much increased as to reduce the value to the Treasuryof abolishing balance of civil pay.     He goes on to point out that it isimpossible to dissociate a disagreeable &quot;means test&quot; aspect from any system of National Service Grants.     The figure of  500 is, of course,provisional and can be re-examined if it is held to be inadequate.     Iunderstand that the Ministry of Pensions estimate that a higher maximum
grant would make no significant difference either to the cost of thescheme or to the numbers required to administer it.     The numbercalled up from the higher income groups, who alone would benefit fromthe higher maximum, would be relatively unimportant.6. The Minister does not refer to the man-power saving whichabolition of balance of civil pay would produce in the Services themselves.I understand that the practice in the last war led to a great deal of paperwork in Paymasters&apos; Offices, etc. , with the inevitable crop of mistakesand belated adjustments, and we should do all we can to avoid tying upman-power - whether uniformed or not - on work of this kind.    I shouldhave expected that, on purely administrative grounds, my proposal wouldbe welcomed by the Services.7. The Minister suggests that if the Government should decide to abandon the practice of balance of civil pay, they would be taking upa position which they would be unable to hold in war-time when the full extent of hardship to which the new policy gave rise would become apparent.     If we abolish this practice in peace-time, objections will undoubtedly be raised in Parliament and in the Press.     But I should hope that these objections could be overcome and that public opinion,having been accustomed to the change in practice, would not altereven  in the more emotional atmosphere of war.    And I personallywould have thought that the system of National Service Grants would beand would be seen to be a good deal fairer than maintaining for other civil servants a system by which they, unlike the majority of those whohave paid in taxation the money needed, receive more favourable treatment.8. On the other hand, I entirely agree that we cannot afford toimprove the War Service Grant scheme forthwith in the hope of effecting a saving in the cost of balance of civil pay unless we intend to stick to our decision to abolish civil pay even in the event of war.Unless we have this resolve)T would rather not proceed with my sugges-tion since, if we were to change our policy on the outbreak of war, weshould have the worst of both worlds - a more expensive War ServiceGrant scheme and no saving of civil pay.9. I still feel that there is good ground for abolishing thepractice of balance of civil pay in peace and for maintaining the samepolicy in war.H.G.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,16TH JANUARY, 1951..
