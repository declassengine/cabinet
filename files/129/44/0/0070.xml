IS DOCUMENT-IS-THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETrj aeJ J.CP.(51) 70 COPY NO._6TH MARCH, 1951CABINETBRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION:   FINANCIAL position memorandum by the Minister of transport i have received from the British Transport Commission theattached memorandum on their financial position.   The recent wagesettlement with the Railway Unions, coupled with other rises in costs which were not taken into account when the present level of railway charges was settled, have made an adjustment in charges imperative if theCommission^ existing accumulated deficit on net revenue of some  40millions is not to grow at a rapid rate.2. In regard to their railways the Commission point out that the total increase in their wages bill, including necessary consequential of therecent settlement, will amount to  19 millions per annum above the figureadopted for the purpose of fixing present levels of charges and that inaddition increases in costs of materials which have already taken placeamount to a further  6 millions per annum, of which  3millions represents the increased price of coal and  .4 millions additional petrol dutyimposed by the current Finance Act.   They are thus faced with annual costs for their railways of  25 millions in excess of those contemplated when their current levels of charges were fixed.3. In regard to the London area the increases authorised by theTribunal under the present interim passenger charges scheme submittedto them in March, 1950, have already, as indicated in paragraph 7 of theCommission^ memorandum, proved insufficient for their purpose and anearly increase is necessary if passenger transport in the area is to make its appropriate contribution to the revenue of the Commission.   Sincethe current fares came into operation last autumn the costs of london transport alone have increased by  3 millions per annum.The charges made by the Commission for their road haulage services are, for practical purposes, within their own discretion, subject to ordinary commercial considerations which include the fact of competition by freehauliers over part of their field.   The costs of road haulage have, ofcourse, also increased and the Commission indicate in paragraph 10 oftheir memorandum that while services are still being taken over and organised and much preliminary expenditure has to be written off, it is notpossible at present even to secure an adequate return from the capital invested and still less to make a net contribution to the deficits incurred in other activities.The fares of the bus companies owned by the Commission outside theLondon Area are subject to the jurisdiction of the Licensing Authorities for public Service Vehicles, and increases are subject to the same con-siderations as those affecting fares charged by private bus companies.
The Commission indicate in paragraph 8 of their memorandum that while on present showing a net contribution of about  3 millions from this,source can be looked for in 1951 before allowing for central interest charges, the point may be reached, if the current trends in costs continue,where the net revenue will barely cover central charges unless fares are increased.Docks and inland waterways and hotels are of minor importance and do not affect significantly the net revenue position of the Commission.The present financial situation of the Commission is summarised in the appendix to their memorandum which shows an estimated deficit on net revenue for 1951 at current levels of charges of  35 millions,of which  10 millions represents sums required towards the liquidation of theaccrued deficiency of  40millions and the building up of reserves, a process which cannot be indefinitely delayed.   To meet this the Commission propose,as indicated below, to raise  20millions from railway freight,    3^ millions from railway !passenger traffic outside the London area and  10-11 millions from passenger traffic in the London area.4. I am satisfied that there is no field of economy open to theCommission which would enable them to meet any significant fraction of this increase by reducing their expenditure.   Nor is there any sign of a fall in thegeneral level of prices which, in fact, continue to rise.5. The proposals put forward by the Commission in relation to their charges are as follows:-(a) An immediate emergency increase of 10% on all existing railway freight and parcel rates and dock and canal charges to be effected by regulations made by me under Section 82 of the Transport Act.(b) The submission by the end of March to the Transport Tribunal of charges schemes under Part V of the Act dealing with (1) london passenger fares and (2) main line railway passenger fares.The London scheme will propose a 2d. minimum fare instead ofthe ljd. minimum now in force and provide for a new scale of faresrising by ljd, a mile.   It will also propose increases in early morning cheap fares and season ticket rates and bring a number of sub-normal fares nearer the standard.   In conjunction with parallelproposals for the main line railway services within the London area the changes are estimated to yield additional revenue of   10-11millions of which  8 millions will be derived from London transport services.   The increase over pre-war fare levels would be in theneighbourhood of 75%, a figure which is much below the general levelof increases in prices.The scheme for main line railway fares will propose (i) theretention of the present authorised maximum charge of 2.44d.per mile, (ii) appropriate season ticket rates and (iii) the replacement of workmen&apos;s tickets by cheap early morning fares on the principlealready sanctioned for the London area.   Cancellation of certain special privileges to particular classes of travellers willyield additional revenue.   The Commission propose to retain full discretion to grant cheap day and excursion fares and monthly returntickets.   Some increased revenue is expected to accrue from thecharges scheme for main line passenger fares, but the commission have informed me that it is not likely to be at all large, cannot atpresent be estimated, and in any case is not likely to have any appreciable effect on revenue for 1951.-2-
(c) The Commission intend to raise the level of the fares for    $   0monthly return tickets by about 10% as from the 2nd April.This increase is within their existing powers of charge, and isestimated to yield about  3-1 millions in a full year,(d) As a counterpart to the proposed increase in fares in London,the Commission, like municipal and other operators, are applying to the Licensing Authorities for Public Service Vehicles for authority to increase charges to meet growing costs of operation,The number of such applications from all quarters is increasing,(e) The Commission intend to lodge with the Transport Tribunal ascheme dealing with freight charges for both rail and road by earlyAugust.   The consideration of this scheme by the transport tribunal will be a major operation and the scheme itself is not likely to come into effect before the beginning of 1953 at theearliest.6. The proposals at (a), (b) and (c) above would produce approximately 35 millions per annum.   The first two require reference to the transport tribunal (in different capacities) and cannot therefore be made effectiveimmediately, although it is hoped that there would be a minimum of delay.In the meantime, however, the Commission^ losses are accumulating ata rate of some  25 millions a year.   I strongly support the Commission&apos;splea that charges should be adjusted to provide a balance of  10 millions.As the Commission point out in paragraph 6 of their memorandum, theyhave urgent need of a margin to meet prospective increases in costs inview particularly of their peculiar inability to increase charges withoutthe considerable delays involved in public justification  before an inde-pendent tribunal.   Further the time is overdue when the Commission should begin to comply with their statutory obligation to establish and maintain ageneral reserve.   Appropriate reserves for replacement are also required and finally there is the deficit already accrued.   To make a full provision forthese requirements would demand a figure much in excess of the  10millions proposed to be provided for the time being.7. The immediate issue for consideration is the authorisation of anincrease of 10% on railway freight rates etc,, by regulation under Section 82of the Transport Act.   This would raise the general level of these charges to about 100% above pre-war and is estimated to yield approximately  20millions.      I propose to deal with this at once and to indicate to themembers of the Transport Tribunal, whom I am bound to.consult, my viewthat having regard to the urgency of the matter and the fact that an exhaustive enquiry was held last year before the increase of 16, 2/3rds in railway freight rates became effective in May last, it should be possiblefor them to tender me their advice as required by the Act without thenecessity for a further public hearing.   I hope that they will accept this ,but a decision on the point rests with them.8. The proposed increases in passenger fares in London and else-where will not, of course, be popular.   The recent examination by theTribunal of the finances of the London Transport Executive should shortentheir examination of this scheme but it is clear that they would not beable to avoid a public hearing.9. I have given some consideration to the question whether it wouldbe desirable to make a revenue subsidy or a capital subsidy to theCommission.A revenue subsidy would raise issues of wide importance.   Itwould be represented by critics of the socialisation of industries asconclusive evidence of the failure of the Commission to achieve the-3- i
Ministry of Transport,     W. 1. ,6TH MARCH, 1951.(a)(b)(c)purposes for which, it was set up.   It would, moreover, weaken theposition of the Commission and its Executives in wage negotiations andpave the way for pressure in other socialised industries for similarsubsidies for the purpose of keeping charges down to a level below thatneeded to meet their actual costs.   Clearly it would remove one of theincentives to efficiency in these industries.   In my view a transfer tothe taxpayer in general of the burden of supplying particular socialisedservices below cost could not be justified.There is a case for a lump sum subsidy to the Commission.Although the railways were treated on roughly the same basis as industry generally during the war in that their enhanced revenue during that period was paid to the Government, they were unable/ unlike a great part of manufacturing industry, to improve or expand their equipment which,indeed, was subject to great deterioration owing to excessive wear and tear.While due compensation was paid for this and for deferred maintenancethe railways have been severely hampered by shortage of materials and restrictions on capital investment in the progress which they could otherwise have made in the rehabilitation of their undertaking.   Further,they have lost traffic by restrictions on operation due to causes outside their control.  At present their passenger services are curtailedthrough lack of coal, and severe restrictions were imposed upon them in thewinter of 1947-48 owing to the coal crisis at that time,   Traffic isperforce diverted to road on such occasions and some of it does not return and is permanently lost to the railways.   Finally the residue ofthe sums paid in compensation to the railways at the end of the war, althoughfair in themselves, now represent, in view of rises in costs, far less interms of labour and materials than they did when they were made.   these reasons, which I do not think can be parallelled in other socialised industries, would in my view justify a lump sum contribution to theCommission of  50millions to be applied in liquidation of their accumulated deficit on net revenue of  40 millions plus the furtherdeficit now accruing.   This would enable the Commission to start on an even keel in 1952 and would have a most heartening effect on the morale ofthe Commission^ personnel throughout their undertaking.I invite my colleagues to agreethat I should at once approach the Permanent Members of theTransport Tribunal in regard to an overall increase of 10%in railway freight charges, etc. (paragraph 7 above).that I should raise no objection to the Commission^ proposals in regard to monthly return fares or to their submittingschemes to the Tribunal in regard to passenger fares for Londonand for the main line railways (paragraph 6 above).that I should discuss with the Chancellor of the Exchequer thepossibility of a lump sum contribution of  50millions beingmade by the Exchequer to the Commission for the purposesreferred to in paragraph 9.-A.B.
MEMORANDUM BY THE BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSIONFINANCIAL POSITION OP THE british transport COMMISSION. At the beginning of ]950 the British.Transport Commissionsaw a good prospect of achieving financial equilibrium, apart fromthe absence of any general reserve or margin, provided theiractiv:ties were taken as a whole, and if applications for increases in charges in various directions then made or pending werepromptly granted and there was no further rise in costs.22.     In fact the increase of 16 /3rds in railway freight cbargeswas deferred until the 15th May;    the Budget imposed an additional burden upon the Commission of 6m, per annum through the duties on oil and purchase tax;   much time elapsed before adjustments ofread passenger fares in the Provinces in order to meet the increased costs of fuel, etc.  could be secured from&apos; the Licensing Authoritiesand, late in the year, the consequences of devaluation, re-aruament,and the thaw in the wage freeze ]ed to substantial jnoreases inthe tost of many important supplies (notahly tyres) and toconcessions, under the Brierley and other awards, to large classesof employees.    These and other adverse factors, resulted in adeficienoy which is n*w estimated at between  12m. and  15m.3.     British RailwaysSince the beginning of 195^ further increases in costs havefallen upon the railways, which were not covered in the applicationsfor increased freight charges since they were based approximatelyon costs ruling at the end of 1949, have been as follows:^Salaries and Wages .increases accorded to lower paid workers as from Is t September 1950        ... ... l^m.Payments t* other employees, alterations in conditions, e&apos;t%. following upon awards incorresponding employments outside,    say ... ^m.Settlement effective as from 1st January 1951with the clerks and other conciliation gradeswhich is an increase of no less than  5m.  overthe amount recommended by the Court of Inquiry.      . 12 m.Consequential or parallel increases to shopmenand other grades estimated at   ... ... 5 m.Coal ... ... ... ... 3 m.-&apos;    Petrol Duty      ... ... ... .., * 4m.Stores   (including tyres, clothing and materials used in maintenance)       ... 2.6m.Annual effect, say  25   m.Ih considering this very formidable figure, attention must be fixed on certain points of major significance.4.     First, it is not possible to offset the increase to any substantialextent ,by immediate economies or within any short term of years,    it is sometimes asserted that large economies could be secured by closingstations to passenger traffic and by drastic closing or abandonment
of branch lines.    Some economies (worth  425,^00 a year) havealready been effected by this means and others will be effectedshortly provided that, in its policy of closing unremunerativebranches, the Commission is not prevented or unduly delayed by theopposition of public&apos; bodies.    In this matter the Central ConsultativeUsers&apos; Committee has been helpful.In many outlying parts of G-reat Britain, and especially inSwotland, long lengths of railway line yield little, if anything,in net receipts, out to shut them down would raise long-term questionsof national policy,But such economies, together with many other detailed operatingand administrative economies, important anC useful as they are, cannotgo far towards filling the gap.    The major economies in railway operatiwhich have been, and are being, planned consist of technical changessuch, for example, as standardisation of the vra.gon stock.   Meanwhile,they make added demands upon our financial resources.   They can onlyyield their fruits in the course of years, not months, since the economies are not attainable until a substantial block uf the present,and partly obsolete, stock has been renewed.    The same is true ofmany other reforms (e.g. continuous braking of goods trains, etc.)which will speed up railway traffio and put it in a better competitiveoondition.    Transfer of traffic between road and rail services inorder to secure the best results is a matter in which much moreprogress would have been made if it had been possible to overcomemore readily the reluctance of the staff to accept changes.Then it is also often asserted that the railway staff can andshould be reduced by figures variously assessed up to 1^0,000 men.These assertions overlook the fact that the railways are doing more work in terms of ton miles and passenger miles than they did before -the war - that the 44 hour week, holidays with pay, etc. inevitably involve more man-power, and that the number of persons employed on british Railways has in fact been reduced ley 2(9,^08 during theyear 1950 and by 54,000 since July 1948. A chart showing the reduotioris attached. Further savings in staff will be effected, and indeed are essential since anout tjyc-thirds of the total costs of British Railwaysrepresent salaries and wages, though the neoessary action may lead tostoppages of work,1 in spite of the recent undertakings of the leadersof the Unions. But neither long term economies uor early reductions of staff on any practicable jcale can possibly offset rising costs ofthe magnitude set out in paragraph 3.5.     Reference has already leen made to the delays, which occur inadjusting charges Through the statutory machinsry, to which the Oommiss:ar-3 subject in most of their activities.   Months elapse in argumentbefore the various sanctioning authorities, and the strain upon the tiisand energies of the senior staff of the Commissions undertakingsnecessarily engaged in these enquiries is in itself serious.    TheCharges Schemes to be submitted, under the Transport Act will at best.occupy several months and, in the oase of the Freight Charges scheme at least the period is likely to extend to years.   In sharp contrast to this procedure, the Commission learn from the newspapers of the increases in prices to which they themselves have to submit and whiohthey have to pay without notice, argument or delay.6       There is a more fundamental consideration to which hitherto theCommission have failed to get proper v/eight attached.    If financialequilibrium in any real sense is ever to be established, the commission&apos;Budget and its charging powers must provide adequate margins forreserves and contingencies and to write off the net deficienciesof 1948/50.   With time lags of the order indicated above, this budget is bound to continue to be in a state of unbalance so long as wages and price levels are rising, unless the authorities are prepared to fir    fcharges in advance at a level which takes reasonable account ofprospective increases in costs likely to result from the general trend.
have nevertheless fallen considerably during the last year.    on present showing a net contribution of about  3m. before centralinterest charges oan be expected for 1951* but, if the present trend of rising costs continues, it will reduce this figure to a point whereit barely covers the central charges, except insofar as it may bepossible by further applications to the Licensing Authorities to keep pace with rising costs.5.     Docks and OanalsThese activities have also been seriously affected by rising costs.The recent settlement with the Railway Unions have added abput  ^m. tothe wages bill on these undertakings, but the losses are not of rajorimportance in the Budget of the Commission o.s a whole.10,    Road Haulage.While the services are still being taken over and organised, and much preliminary expenditure has to be written off, it is not possible -to secure an adequate return upon the capital invested, still less tomake a net contribution to deficits incurred in other activities.Increases in Wages, Fuel Duty and. Tyres have during 1950 added about 7m. in a full year to expenditure, and are the major factors in thetwo inoreases in rates already made amounting to        per cent over thoseprevailing&apos;at the beginning of 1950.11,    Other ActivitiesActivities such as Hotels, Commercial Advertising, Letting of properties, etc. are not subject to price regulation and efforts arebeing made to keep pace with rising costs.    The results are not of sufficient importance in any one case to have a marked effect on thetotal Budget, but it is nevertheless essential that each of them should earn a proper revenue.PROPOSED ACTION WITH A VIEW TO MEETING DEFICIENCYThe attached statement shows the main services under which theestimated deficiencies will arise.    To these figures must be added areasonable sum for liquidating the accrued deficiency of  ZtOm. and building up reserves, together with some margin to cover the further increases in costs, which are inevitable if the present trend continues.The total sum required is  35m., and this is the basis on which theCommission must formulate their proposals.   Any allowanoe for possible economies cannot in 1951 do more than act as a partial offset to thefact that some part of the year will have elapsed before increased charges can become effective.   A net addition of  lOm.  is the minimum which can be contemplated as some contribution towards building upreserves and meeting the further rises in costs already on the horizon,FaresThe Commission will lodge with the Transport Tribunal by the endof March Charges Schemes under Fart V of the Transport Act dealingwith (1) London Fares, and with (2) Main Line Railway Fares.    The first of these Schemes will propose the abolition of the Tgd. fare now inforce and provide for a new scale of fares rising by 1-gd. a mile after a 2d. minimum fare.   It will also propose increases in the early morningcheap fares and season ticket rates and bring a number of sub-normalfares nearer to the standard.    In conjunction with parallel proposalsfor the services given by the main line railways in the London area,these changes are estimated to yiexd a revenue of the order of  ltro- all.of which  8m. will be derived from London Transport &quot;services, but theycannot become operative under the statutory procedure for some months.  .This would mean no more than an increase of about 75 per cent over pre-war fare : levels.
Hitherto there has &quot;been a tendency to take into acoount only thoseincreases in cost which have already occurred, or to which the undertakings have been already committed.In the interim application for. increased Freight Charges at thebeginning of last year, the Commission for various reasons did not askfor an increase sufficient to balance the Budget completely ana made no attempt to obtain funds to start a Renewals or a General Reserve or to recoup past losses, which have reached a total of nearly  40m.   It isnow essential, if any early recurrence of financial embarrassment isto be avoided, that all ooncerned should look forward and not back.7.     London TransportAfter proceedings lasting several months, the London Area PassengerScheme (oovering also the suburban services of British Railways) was approved by the Transport Tribunal in an amended form.    When the schemewas lodged in March 1950, the Commission asked for  0.7m. less than,in their view, was required.to balance the Budget, together with all necessary reserves.    The Tribunal did not aooept the submissions ofthe Commissions witness upon, the probable effects of .unrationedpetrol on the passenger takings, and other changes in-circumstances,notably the fuel duty, affected costs while the Hearing was in progress.In the result the Commission were granted charges estimated to yield from all services, road and rail, in the London Transport Area a sumof  4. 5m. per annum less than the full sum which, by reasons of allthe then known factors, including those which had shown themselvessince the application was lodged, they thought to be already required at the time when the Tribunal gave its deoi^-ion.    This figure includes  1.2m. for fuel duty.Since September 1950 further major increases in the annual costs of London Transport, excluding the servibes of the main lines which are recovered by the figures in paragraph 3, have been as follows;- .WagesRoad staff (3.1.51.)Minor chargesPending IncreasesPetrol and Fuel Oil - successive recentincreases in price ... , 2m.Tyres - successive increases&apos; ... .5m.Coal ... ... ... . 2m.Other Materials ... ...    .... .3m.Increase (London Transport Executive only)  3- 0m.There has also been&apos; a.decline in traffics to which must be added the gap of about  4gm. left by the Tribunal&apos;s decision, part of which is attributable to main line serviaes.8.     Provincial and Scottish Bus CompaniesThese organisations have suffered increases in their costs of thesame kind and order as were suffered ,by London Transport.    The Brierleyaward of 7s. 6d. a week to platform staff, for example, cost theTilling Group alone nearly  lm. a year.    Each Company is a separate&apos;unit and has attempted to obtain increases to cover at least part ofthe rising costs.    The net receipts of the Commission from this source1. 2m.. 2m.1. 4m.. 4m.
The second scheme will propose the retention of the present authorised maximum charge of 2.44d. per mile, appropriate seasonticket rates and the replacement of workmen&apos;s tickets by cheapearly morning fares on the principle already sanctioned for theLondon area.    Cancellation of certain special privileges to particular classes of travellers will further fortify the revenue.The Commission will retain full discretion to grant cheap day and&apos;excursion fares and monthly return tickets.It is intended to raise the level of the monthly return ticketsby about 10 per cent and, as the Commission are advised that it iscompetent *-o them to make this particular increase at once under theexisting regulations, they propose to brino; it into force on the2nd April,    It is estimated to yield net about  jrgm. in a full year.The immediate introduction of this increase will make che futureprogress of the Charges Scheme simpler.So far as road passenger fares are concerned, the commission have maintained the structure of the groups of Companies which it hasacquired and their charges are therefore subject to the licensing authorities and do not require to be covered by a scheme under theTransport Act. - At this stage, when the Commission&apos;s control of road transport is so far from complete, and while they.are exposed to theunrestricted competition of the motor coawh, it would not be practicable to formulate any satisfactory Charges Schemes such as canToe applied to the railways.Freight ChargesIt is intended to lodge with the Transport Tribunal.a Schemedealing with Freight Charges &quot;before the present limit of time for suchlodgment expires early in August next.    This will only prove possible if the time of senior Officers and witnesses is not meanwhile absorbed in prolonged Hearings about emergency applications.    But even&apos;if thedate can be kept, the most optimistic could not expect to see theScheme in operation before the 1st January 1953 and it is more likely that the.operative date will be a year or more later.The Commission are, therefore, compelled to ask the Minister togrant them an emergency increase of 10 per cent on all existingrailway freight rates and to ensure that this is done rapidly andwithout the. prolonged Hearing which resulted last year when they werechallenged by the National Coal Board, the Iron and Steel Federation,the British Electricity Authority and other interests.    If the minister thinks it expediert to do se with.a view to ensuring a sufficientrevenue to the Commission, he may authorise increases by regulationafter consulting the permanent members of.the Transport Tribunal.It is suggested that the Minister should exercise his right and his responsibility to determine that the increase of 10 per cent is expedient, and that the point to which the Transport Tribunal should address their minds is not whether.the increase is required, but whether they wouid advise any other method than a flat percentage increase to tide over the interval before a freight scheme can be approved.    This will raise freight charges generally to about100 per cent above the pre-war level.The Charges Scheme, to be lodged with the Tribunal as a basis for permanent charging powers will cover a great variety of mattersincluding, e.g. Conditions of Carriage,- methods&apos; of measuringdistances, etc. , in none of which would any change be proposed aspart of an emergency increase.    It should also be added that, whilethe Charges Scheme will cover the powers of.the Commission to maKecharges for services by road, it will ask for discretionary powersto make such charges, subject perhaps to appeal to the Tribunal ona question of reasonableness.    In the constantly changing conditionsof/the present times and with the high degree of competition from
short distance hauliers and &quot;0&quot; licence holders, to which theCommission&apos;s road services are exposed, it is not practicable to tie road rates rigidly to any scheme of railway freight rates.   .t.nynecessary correlation will -be secured by administrative action onthe part of the Commission, who may lay down working (but notstatutory) scales for. scheduled services.summary-   To sum up the position     &apos;1.     After making allowance for all immediate practicable economies,and providing for necessary reserves and margins,&apos; the Commission needan addit? onal revenue from increased oharges of about  35m. a yearto meet the level of expenditure which they have to face.2.     The Commission will use their own-powers&apos;and discretion toincrease charges where they are free to do so.3. They propose immediately on their own responsibility to increasemonthly return fares by rail by 1C per oent, giving roughly a rate ofljfd. a mile,   yield  3?m. in a full year.4.     They do not propose to ask the Minister to sarction a similarincrease in other fares, but will deal with this matter.in the passenger Oharges Scheme to be submitted shortly to the transport tribunal.5.     As regards fares by road arl. rail, in thi London Area, ChargesSchemes will be lodged in the near future with the Transport tribunal and will be so framed as to yield from  10m. to  all. in a full year,about  2-3m. of which will come from main line servioes. .     They will endeavour to secure increased charges for the variousbus companies from the Licensing Authorities, who are generallyresponsible to the Minister.   No extra, yield on balance.7.     As regards Railway Freight Charges, (including charges for :merchandise and parcels by passenger train), Docks and Canals, theyask the Minister to.sanction immediately an emergency flat increaseof 10 per cent.   Net yield after discount for loss of traffio isestimated at about  20m.There would of course be some loss of traffic as &quot;a result of increases, but this has been carefully-measured by the commercialexperts of the various concerns and, in the present state of industryand with the present level of industry profits, they are satisfiedthat the increases of the order proposed will yield the net amountsestimated. &apos;   -&apos;. With these changes and strict control of expenditure, there willbe a reasonable- prospect of gradually putting the Commissionsfinances on an even keel, provided there are no furtherrapid andmarked general increases in prices or in taxation directly bearingupon the Commission or in wages.5th March, 1951
