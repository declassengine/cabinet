(50) 37th Conclusions, Minute 2),the Cabinet invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a review to be made of thefurther means which might be adopted to check the immigration into this country of coloured people from British Colonial territories, if legislation were passedumiting the right of British subjects, or of any class of British subjects, to enterand reside in the United Kingdom, and of the issues of policy involved in making such a change in the existing law. To carry out this review the Prime Ministerappointed an ad hoc Committee composed of the following Ministers:  Home Secretary (in the Chair).Minister of Labour.Minister of Health.Secretary of State for the Colonies.Secretary of State for Scotland.Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations.Attorney-General.Our report is as follows.   ^Extent2. We first considered the extent of the problems presented by the immigra-tion into this country of coloured people from British Colonial territories. Formany years permanent communities of coloured persons of Colonial origin have
lived in various parts of the United Kingdom. Most of them are either of west african or West Indian extraction, or Moslem people, mainly from Aden orSomaliland. In general, they look to. this country as their home and have no intention of returning to their countries of origin. They are thought to numbersome 30,000, the larger groups being found in Merseyside, London, Cardiff andTyneside.3. Since 1945, at least 5,000 coloured immigrants from the Colonies, almost all West Africans or West Indians, have arrived here. They have come as stow-aways, seafarers or fare-paying immigrant workers. Over the past four years thestowaways have arrived and continue to arrive at the rate of about 400 a year.It is not known how many have come as seafarers, but at present about 500 colouredmen who are unemployed call themselves &quot; seamen &quot;: there is no doubt that inthe past many &quot; one-trip seamen &quot; have signed on in overseas ports for dischargein the United Kingdom in the vain hope of obtaining seafaring employment here.In the years following the war there were a number of notable shipments of fare-paying migrant workers. It is estimated that since 1945 about 2,000 migrantworkers have arrived from the West Indies, many of them in large parties travellingin troopships at cheap rates. Since 1949 there have been no large parties, but thereis reason to believe that the total number of workers arriving has not fallen off.4. Unemployment and destitution among these coloured people of all typesare not so widespread as to have any noticeable effect on our economy. On24th July, 1950, the number of unemployed male Colonials (including the &quot; sea-men &quot; mentioned above) in the main areas where coloured persons live was 1,102;the corresponding figure on 24th July, 1949, was 1,200. Many of these persons were only temporarily out of work. As regards reliance on national assistance, a sample check during one week in August 1950 showed that 572 coloured Colonialshad applied for such assistance; 112 of them had come here as stowaways and85 of these 112 had arrived during the last two years.Possible legislation. We examined three possible methods involving legislation by which the *entry of British subjects into the United Kingdom, or their residence here mightbe controlled. These are described in the following paragraphs and are: theapplication to British subjects of the controls now applied only to aliens; the depor-tation of British subjects coming within certain categories; and the return of Britishstowaways to the territory from which they embarked or to which they belong.6. Application of Aliens Control to British Subjects. -Powers might be takensimilar to those now applied to aliens. An account of the law and practice relatingto aliens is given in Appendix I. Briefly, this1 method of control would mean thata British subject from a Colony or independent Commonwealth country would notbe admitted to the United Kingdom unless the Immigration Officer were satisfiedthat he was a returning resident or genuine visitor, or was coming to take up employ-ment authorised by the Ministry of Labour or for some other approved purpose suchas study. The primary object would be to ensure that British subjects who had no work in the United Kingdom did not settle here.7. There would be no insuperable administrative difficulty in exercising thenecessary control at the ports, though it would mean subjecting British subjects tosome delays. The main burden of administration would, however, fall on theMinistry of Labour. The conditions for the grant of labour permits need notnecessarily be identical with those applied to aliens but some check of the bonafides of the application would clearly be desirable. It would also be necessary to verify that wages and conditions of work were suitable even if there were no con-dition, such as that applied to aliens, that labour was not already available in thiscountry. But in some industries and occupations the introduction of legislation tocontrol the admission of citizens of the Commonwealth and Colonies might give riseto demands for safeguards of this type from competition by overseas labour.. 8. The additional staff requirements needed to operate such an extension ofthe permit procedure would, of course, depend on the number of applicationsreceived but might be substantial. If the control were applied to persons from theColonies and the independent Commonwealth countries, it would be difficult tojustify the exemption of persons from the Irish Republic. On the basis of thenumber of applications for insurance cards it appears that some thirty or forty
thousand persons come to Great Britain from the Irish Republic each year. Theissuing of permits to all citizens of the Irish Republic who come for employmentmight, therefore, by itself, be almost as substantial a block of work as the presentaliens permit administration, and it would be particularly unrewarding as thereWould be few, if any, Irish workers whom we should wish to exclude.9. Such a system of control could not be effective without the interrogation of individuals and the imposition where necessary of landing conditions as in the caseof aliens. A power to deport persons who broke their landing conditions wouldalso probably be necessary.10. Deportation of British Subjects. The main problems in relation to the immigration of British subjects from Colonial territories arise because they aretempted to come to the United Kingdom by better prospects of employment and inthe knowledge that if they fail to find work they will be supported by the social services at a higher standard of living than many of them had in the Colonies. Apossible scheme would, therefore, be to leave the entry of British subjects into theUnited Kingdom unrestricted, but to empower the Home Secretary to deport anyoverseas British subject who had been resident in the United Kingdom for not morethan two years (or perhaps a longer period) and who had (i) applied for national assistance; or (ii) been convicted of a serious offence; or (hi) attempted to createindustrial unrest. This last condition, which would be difficult to define in legis-lation, might operate only if a state of emergency had been declared. The cabinet considered at their meeting on 27th July, 1949 (CM. (49) 49th Conclusions,Minute 5) whether power should be taken to permit the deportation from theUnited Kingdom of British subjects who, not being United Kingdom citizens,engaged in subversive activities in this country, but no decision was reached.11. A scheme on these lines would probably be administratively practicable,though we understand that it would involve certain difficulties for the national assistance Board. There is also the point that in order to operate any system ofdeportation it is necessary to get some country overseas to receive the persondeported. In the case of independent Commonwealth countries this should not give rise to serious difficulties since it could be established that the person was a citizen of the country concerned. But Colonials are citizens of the United Kingdomand Colonies, and it would be necessary to devise some means of determining towhich Colony a particular person belonged; this would probably not be beyondsolution in the majority of cases.12. Return of British Stowaways. A third possibility would be to confineany measures taken to British subjects who come to the United Kingdom as stow-aways. This would deal with only part of the problem, but, nevertheless, aconsiderable improvement might be effected if power were taken to deal with thisparticularly difficult class of person. The existing practice in relation to alienstowaways is to refuse them leave to land. The master of the ship on which they came is under an obligation to take them back to the port from which theyembarked and the owners or agents are under a contingent obligation to do so or toreturn them to the country of which they are nationals. In order to enable Britishstowaways to be dealt with similarly, it would be necessary to take power by legis-lation (i) to require the master, owners or agents of the ship to remove the stow-away to the territory from which he embarked for the United Kingdom or to theterritory to which he belongs, (ii) to require the master to detain the stowaway onboard until seen by the Immigration Officer, or, if the Immigration Officer so directs,to continue to detain him while the ship remains in port, and (iii) to place thestowaway temporarily on shore and to detain him there, either at the request of the master or on the instructions of the Immigration Officer. The powers relating toreturn of the stowaway and detention on shore would apply to stowawaysfound in the United Kingdom up to, say, two months from the date of arrival, and penalties would have to be prescribed not only for contraventionsbut for aiding and abetting contraventions. Corresponding powers wouldbe necessary with regard to stowaways in aircraft. The new powers would be inaddition to the existing powers in the Merchant Shipping Acts and the Air Navi-gation (Stowaways) Order; the existing powers would still be invoked in cases whereit was thought necessary to prosecute a stowaway because his presence hadendangered the craft. This general solution would not present administrative difficulties.
Issues of Policy13. The three possible eourses outlined in paragraphs 6 to 12 above, all raiseto a greater or less degree the following issues of policy:  (i) The United Kingdom has a special status as the mother country, and freedom to enter and remain in the United Kingdom at will is one ofthe main practical benefits enjoyed by British subjects, as such. Allthe Colonies and independent Commonwealth countries (except, atpresent, India and Pakistan) impose restrictions on the entry into their territory of British subjects, though the extent of the restrictions varies.An account of the law and practice on this matter in the Colonies,independent Commonwealth countries and the Irish Republic is givenin Appendix II.(ii) The present concept of British nationality, as embodied in the british nationality Act, 1948, is that British nationality is derived throughcitizenship of any one of the self-governing countries within the Common-wealth. For citizenship purposes, the United Kingdom together withthe Colonies forms one unit, and it would be contrary to the scheme tosubdivide that unit. Furthermore, it would be difficult to justifyrestrictions on persons who are citizens of the United Kingdom and colonies, if no comparable restrictions were imposed on persons whoare citizens of other Commonwealth countries, or even, as in the case of citizens of the Irish Republic, are citizens of a country outside theCommonwealth. Yet on general grounds it is undesirable particularly at the present stage of Commonwealth development, that such restric-tions should be imposed on citizens of the independent commonwealth countries and it is agreed policy that in these matters the Irish Republic-   shall be treated on a similar basis to Commonwealth countries.(iii) Any solution depending on an apparent or concealed colour test wouldbe so invidious as to make it impossible of adoption. Nevertheless, theuse of any powers taken to restrict the free entry of British subjects tothis country would, as a general rule, be more or less confined tocoloured persons. We consider that this fact provides an argument in favour of limiting any powers taken to the exclusion of specific and well defined categories of persons, such as those who become a charge on public funds or stowaways, whose continued presence here is clearlyopen to objection. Even so, coloured persons would be mainly con-cerned, and this might possibly give rise to resentment in India, pakistan and Ceylon and in the more advanced Colonial territories.14. It has been suggested, to us that, if the scope of a Bill on stowaways onthe lines indicated in paragraph 12 above were widened to cover both alien andBritish stowaways and were presented as a measure dealing with stowaways ingeneral, it might thereby be made less controversial. But the existing powers ofthe Aliens Order are quite adequate to deal with alien stowaways, and it would bedifficult to argue that they need to be duplicated. Moreover, if powers to deal withalien stowaways were included in the Bill, there would be a risk that through amend-ments made during its passage the existing powers would be weakened.Conclusions15. In view of the comparatively small scale of immigration into this country of coloured people from British Colonial territories (see paragraph 2 above) and theimportant and controversial issues of policy involved in legislation to control it, weconsider that no such legislation should at present be introduced. Even the legis-lation on stowaways outlined in paragraph 12 the least far-reaching of the methodsof control we have considered would mean a break in the traditional policy ofgiving all British subjects the right to enter the United Kingdom and to enjoy thesame rights and privileges as are given to United Kingdom citizens. We are aware,however, that in the long-term social standards in the Colonies lower than thosein the United Kingdom, may well result in considerable migration to this countryand that the social services in the United Kingdom, particularly the rights of which any destitute person can avail himself under the National Assistance Act, must inevitably act as a considerable attraction. We recognise that a very large increasein such migration in the future might produce a situation in the United Kingdomrendering legislation for its control essential, despite the very strong opposing con-siderations which we have mentioned; but, for the present, we regard these opposing
considerations as conclusive. The Secretary of State for the Colonies has under-taken to advise his colleagues if, at any time., there are indications of any large increase above the present scale of immigration from the Colonies, so that thequestion of introducing legislation may then again be considered.Administrative Measures to Control Stowaways16. In view of our conclusion that legislation would not, under presentcircumstances, be justified, we thought it proper to review in some detail admini-strative measures for the control of stowaways and &quot; one-trip seamen&quot; from colonial territories, not involving legislation. The Minister of Transport took part with us in this review. An account of these administrative controls is given inAppendix III. Their effect is limited, but we consider that if applied vigorouslythey should, under present conditions, prevent serious difficulty. We therefore recommend that these measures should continue and should be made as effective as possible.SummaryIn brief, our conclusions and recommendations are as follows: -(i) At least 5,000 coloured immigrants from the Colonies have arrived in theUnited Kingdom since 1945. They have come as stowaways, &quot; one-trip seamen &quot; and fare-paying immigrant workers. Unemployment anddestitution among coloured Colonials in this country is not so wide-spread as to have any noticeable effect on our economy (paragraphs to 4).(ii) Three possible methods of control would be: to apply to British subjectsthe controls now applied to aliens (paragraphs 6 to 9); to deport Britishsubjects coming within certain categories (paragraphs 10 and 11); toreturn British stowaways to the territory from which they embarked orto which they belong (paragraph 12).(iii) Each of these methods of control would be controversial and at variance with our traditional policy of giving all British subjects the right to enterand reside in the United Kingdom (paragraphs 13 and 14).(iv) We consider that the introduction of legislation to control immigration from the Colonies would not at present be justified (paragraph 15).(v) We recommend that the Departments concerned should continue to renderas effective as possible administrative measures for the control ofstowaways and&quot; &quot; one-trip seamen,&quot; from Colonial territories(paragraph 16).(Initialled on behalf of the Committee)Home Office, S.W.1,6th February, 1951.APPENDIX IThe Law and Practice Governing the Entry of Aliens to theUnited KingdomPowers of the Home Secretary. Extensive powers to control the entry of aliensto the United Kingdom have been conferred on the Home Secretary, and on Immi-gration officers acting under his orders.  The chief are:  (i) An Immigration Officer may refuse to allow any alien to land. In theabsence of a special dispensation from the Secretary of State, he mustrefuse leave to land to an alien who is unable to support himself or his dependants, or who has come to take employment without a permit fromthe Ministry of Labour and National Service (whose practice is explained in paragraph 2 below), or who is of unsound mind, sick or a convicted
criminal-. If he does allow ah alien to land, the Immigration Officer may,and frequently does, impose such conditions as he may judge fit, themost usual being limitations as to length of stay and as to takingemployment.(ii) An Immigration Officer may direct the detention pending departure of anyalien to whom he refuses leave to land, and may require the master orowner of the ship which brought him to remove him. In particular, the, Immigration Officer may take such action in regard to alien stowaways.(iii) The Home Secretary may deport any alien if the court recommends this,or if he considers that the alien&apos;s deportation would be conducive to thepublic good. The Home Secretary may order the detention, pendingdeportation, of any alien in respect of whom he has signed a depor-tation order. All deportation cases are submitted to the Home Secretaryhimself.(iv) An alien admitted to the United Kingdom must register with the police,and notify them of any change of circumstances, including change ofaddress.2. The Ministry of Labour permit system for the employment of aliens in theUnited Kingdom. An alien coming to this country to take employment with aparticular employer must have a permit in writing issued to that employer by theMinister of Labour and National Service. Thus, the employer must apply for thepermit in advance, and while the alien is still abroad. The general conditions governing the grant of permits are that:  (i) The proposed employment of an alien is reasonable and necessary in thecircumstances.(ii) Adequate efforts have been made by the employer to find suitable labourwithin the country.(iii) The wages and other conditions of employment proposed are not less favourable than those commonly accorded to British employees for similar work in the district concerned.These matters are, where necessary, tested in detail by the Ministry of Labour before a permit is issued; in some cases consultations with industrial organisations are alsoundertaken. The permit, if issued, is sent to the employer who sends it to the alienfor production to the Immigration Officer at the port of arrival.3. If aliens attempt, as they often do, to evade the employment control bypretending to come for some other purpose, e.g., on a visit, they have to sustaininterrogation by the Immigration Officer, who will, if his suspicions are aroused,either refuse to admit the alien or impose landing conditions prohibiting pr restriet-ing employment. For those who slip through there is the remedy of deportation.APPENDIX IIImmigration Law and Practice in the Colonies, the Self-GoverningCommonwealth Countries and the Irish RepublicColonies. Most Colonies impose restrictions on the entry of all persons(including British subjects) who cannot be said to belong to their territories. Forthis purpose they consider that the following categories belong to the territory andmay not be excluded:  (i) A person born or naturalised in the Colony, or born outside the Colony ofparents Who at the time of his birth were ordinarily resident there;(ii) A person who has been ordinarily resident in the Colony at least seven years, arid has not since then lived elsewhere in the Commonwealth for more than seven years.2. British subjects not in either of the above categories are excluded if theyare convicted criminals, sick, of unsound mind, without sufficient means to supportthemselves or their dependants, or are deemed for other special reasons, e.g..security, to be undesirable;  Some Colonies also exclude all stowaways.
3. Many Colonies require all persons entering their territories to have entrypermits obtained in advance, and give their Immigration Officers a discretion torequire deposits sufficient to cover the return fare.4. In 1933 the Colonial Office recommended that deportation powers over allpersons (including British subjects) not belonging to the territory concerned should apply to the following persons, within the time unfits indicated:  (i) To persons contravening the immigration law, within three months of arrival.(ii) To criminals, within two years of arrival.(iii) To persons whose continued presence in the territory is a menace to peace,order, good government or public morals, within two years of arrival.(iv) To persons likely for health or other reasons to become a charge on public funds, within twelve months of arrival.In general, Colonies have followed these recommendations.5. Self-governing Commonwealth countries. The powers of self-governingCommonwealth countries to exclude or deport British subjects may be summarised:as follows:(i) Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa prohibit the immigration of certain categories of persons without distinctionbetween British subjects and aliens. The prohibited classes include those mentally or physically diseased, criminals, vagrants, and advocates of subversion. The operation of New Zealand law bites less stringentlyupon British subjects than upon aliens. The law of the Union of SouthAfrica also excludes persons deemed by the Minister on economic grounds or on account of habits of life to be unsuitable.(ii) The countries whose powers to control immigration are summarised in(i) above, have similar powers to deport prohibited immigrants andcertain other categories without distinction between British subjects andaliens. The qualification about New Zealand applies in this case also.(iii) It is difficult to state with any certainty the present position in India and pakistan, especially the latter. There is no power under the law in forcein India or Pakistan to prohibit the entry into those countries of Britishsubjects, neither is there power to prevent them settling there except thePublic Safety Act in India. A valid rule could be made under the public safety Act for the deportation or expulsion from India of any person,not excluding a British subject. Until a rule is made, however, it isbelieved to be true to say that, apart from the European Vagrancy Act,there is no law in force in India under which a British subject could bedeported or expelled. The position in these countries is a survival fromthe period of British rule, and the Governments of India and Pakistanmay before very long take powers similar to those possessed by the olderCommonwealth countries.(iv) All persons who are not citizens of Ceylon require a valid passport, visa orresidence permit for entry to the Island. Permission to enter would normally be refused to persons in categories similar to the &quot; prohibited &quot;immigrants of the older Commonwealth countries. Powers of deportation-tion apply to all persons except Ceylonese citizens.6. The Irish Republic. The Irish Republic and the United Kingdom do not regard each other&apos;s citizens as foreigners and no control appears to be exercised bythe Government of the Irish Republic over British subjects.7. United Kingdom citizens may enter the Irish Republic at will on productionof a valid British passport or travel identity card. A visa is not required. Thepresent arrangements are a legacy of war-time conditions and are presumably kept in force by the authorities of the Irish Republic as a counterpart of the UnitedKingdom&apos;s present requirements that British subjects and citizens of the irish republic arriving from the Republic must produce a valid passport or travel identitycard.8. Though it cannot be stated with certainty that the Irish Republic have no powers to deport United Kingdom citizens, it seems that they never do so. The IrishRepublics Statutory Instrument No. 1 of 1949 provides that&quot; Citizens of.the UnitedKingdom and Colonies shall, subject to law, enjoy in Ireland similar rights and
privileges to those enjoyed by Irish citizens in the United Kingdom and colonies by virtue of the British Nationality Act, 1948.&quot; Considerations which influence theIrish Republic authorities no doubt include the following:  (i) The corresponding restraint of the United Kingdom authorities.   (Apartfrom the Prevention of Violence (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1939, theUnited Kingdom authorities have no power to deport citizens of theIrish Republic.)(ii) There would be little point in deporting United Kingdom citizens from a country which has an open frontier. It would be necessary to institutecorresponding control over entry into the country.APPENDIX IIIAdministrative Measures to Control Stowaways, not involvingLegislationThe controls at present exercised over stowaways are as follows:  (i) At the port of arrival, by Immigration Officers acting under the AliensOrder to ensure that the stowaways are not aliens; and by the shipping companies themselves who may prosecute stowaways on British ships under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894. The penalty is a fine notexceeding  20, or imprisonment not exceeding four weeks,. (ii) The ship&apos;s master may try to disembark stowaways at intermediate portsen route or even at sea.(iii) In the Colonial territories, the Governor, port authorities, trading com-panies and shipping companies can exercise checks on stowing away atthe source.The operation of these controls is described in the following paragraphs:  2. At the port of arrival. Immigration officers in the United Kingdom haveno authority to control the entry of a person who can produce satisfactory evidencethat he is a British subject or British protected person. They do, however, provi-provisionally treat as an alien a person who cannot produce such evidence. Of theColonial stowaways who arrived during January to September 1950, ninety-ninewere refused admission. As regards prosecutions for stowing away, the normal practice is to prosecute stowaways who arrive in British ships, whether they are british subjects or aliens. But the penalties in the Merchant Shipping Act have little deterrent effect, and it is doubtful whether any heavier penalties which could resonably be prescribed would be more effective.&apos;&quot; 3. Transfer at intermediate ports. Shipping companies, in their own interests,&apos; to lessen the cost of maintenance, take every chance to return stowaways to their point of embarkation by transfer at intermediate ports or at sea. Throughout theCommonwealth countries they are usually successful, but there is more difficultyat foreign ports. To be effective, a transfer must include detention of the stowawaywhile he is ashore awaiting a return vessel. In foreign ports, especially whereprison standards are poor, it is often found that the &quot;authorities have no power or are unwilling to take the stowaway (who is an alien in their law) into preventivedetention, and that they prefer to refuse permission for the stowaway to be landed at all. To some extent the success of the shipping companies in transferringstowaways depends on the speed with which the stowaway can be removed from theterritory; and at ports on routes where traffic is infrequent the authorities are veryunwilling to accept stowaways for transfer. It has been found that, in general, at ports in Spanish possessions, the immigration regulations prohibit the landing ofstowaways, and transfers can only be made when an outward bound vessel happensto be in port at the same time. The attitude of the stowaways themselves causesdifficulty because masters are not empowered to use force, and where this isnecessary they have to seek help from the local police. There have been manycases, in Spanish possessions and other foreign ports, where the police have refuseda request from the master to assist in the transfer of troublesome stowaways. Theextent of the Commonwealth and the world-wide traffic of the United kingdom are a large factor in the size of the stowaway problem, and most other countries have no.preoccupations of this kind on the same scale.   In those foreign countries
where our shipping companies have encountered particular difficulties, representations have been made through the Foreign Office, but efforts to persuade the foreignauthorities to take powers to deal with stowaways whom we land for transfer havebeen ineffective, since they are not usually interested in our offers of reciprocal treat-ment, which would be of little benefit to them. In the Commonwealth countries,particularly in areas homogeneous with the port of embarkation (such as the west african Colonies), facilities are generally satisfactory. It is doubtful whether verymuch more can be done to obtain further facilities for transfer at foreign inter-mediate ports, although the shipping companies are continuing their efforts.4. Issue of passports. Since stowaways can be refused admission if theycannot produce satisfactory evidence of their British nationality, the Colonial office on 26th January, 1950, asked Colonial Governments to consider whether it wouldbe possible to control the issue of passports to persons who were known not tofollow regular employment and whose financial position was not sound and whowere thought likely to stow away. The response to this has been varied; in someterritories passports are not issued unless the applicant can satisfy the PassportOfficer that he will be able to maintain himself in the United Kingdom; in othersno such test is thought to be feasible. The Government of Jamaica do not favourlegislation to deny passports to persons without means or likely to stow away. Suchaction would be in marked contrast to the United Kingdom practice of refusingpassports only to fugitives from justice and lunatics. It would be difficult for theissuing authority in Jamaica to identify potential stowaways. There are, moreover,emigrants able to pay their fares but lacking means to support themselves in theUnited Kingdom on arrival, and the Government of Jamaica would not be preparedto refuse passports on that ground. The Government of Trinidad have been ableto delay the issue of passports to persons who are unable to produce satisfactoryevidence that they have booked a passage, but this action may be challenged now that the new constitution has come into operation. In general, the Colonial office have gone some way to pressing Colonial Governments to restrict the issue ofpassports, but with the present tendency to give more power to unofficial majoritiesin Colonial Governments it may be difficult to maintain even the present restrictions.5. Issue of other travel documents. Most West African stowaways arrivewith British Travel Certificates. These are issued in West African territories primarily for local travel between British and French possessions, and, though they purportto certify the holder&apos;s national status, they are issued without much enquiry, andit is known that they have been used irregularly. Nevertheless, holders of thesecertificates cannot be refused leave to land in the United Kingdom. The west african Council have accepted certain proposals made by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies on Uth July, 1950, including a proposal that in future thesecertificates should not contain a statement of the nationality of the holder. Thiswould deprive the certificates of their value to potential stowaways. The ForeignOffice have asked the British Consul-General at Dakar to open negotiations withthe French Colonial territories regarding the proposed change. Further, theGovernments of British West African Colonies will seek to deny British TravelCertificates to persons considered likely to use them for the purpose of stowingaway. Nigeria is keeping records of persons from Nigeria refused leave to enter the United Kingdom, and travel documents will not be issued to such persons infuture. Other West African Governments have been asked to consider similar action.6. Control at Colonial Ports. On 26th January, 1950, the Colonial Officesuggested in a despatch to Colonial Governments various possible means of pre-venting stowing away at ports, namely, by controlling the dock areas, registration of dock workers, policing harbours, licensing small craft in harbours and gangwaychecks. In some Colonies controls of this kind have been put in operation, or arebeing considered. In Jamaica, where conditions make control particularly difficult and the incidence of stowing away is highest, the Government have undertaken todiscuss possible measures with the shipping companies; but the Colonial Officethink it doubtful whether the Government will be able to make any appreciableimprovement. The difficulty is that the wharves are privately owned and it is thoughtthat neither the Government of Jamaica nor the owners will be prepared to incurexpenditure on enclosing and controlling the wharves an expenditure which wouldbe heavy for them in relation to the problem. A further difficulty in Jamaica isthat bananas, the principal cargo, are loaded by hand over several gangways, oftenby night, and it has proved practically impossible to prevent a determined person
from stowing away. Sierra Leone and the Gold Coast propose to introduce furtherpolice and labour controls, but in Gambia and Nigeria the expense and inadequacy of local recruits make further measures impracticable at present. The Governor of nigeria, where the port -loading arrangements and the number of labourersemployed make control difficult, considers that any improvement will turn largely on what the shipping companies Can do. He is being kept informed of the numberof Nigerian stowaways arriving, and if it does not decrease he will consider thematter further. The Departments concerned will continue to bring cases to thenotice of the Colonial Governments concerned, but, although some improvementsmay be secured, the physical arrangements for loading at Colonial ports will alwaysafford opportunities for determined stowaways.7. Action by shipping companies. Since 1948 the Ministry of Transport, inconsultation with the other Departments concerned, have been pursuing possibleremedies with the shipping industry. They have investigated reports that shoreworkers at ports abroad assist persons to stow away; but, although suspicion is strong, there is no evidence of a regular or organised practice. The ShippingFederation and individual companies have followed up reports of connivance bymembers of crews, and unofficial watch has been kept by masters on suspectedpersons; although insufficient evidence to prosecute has been found, it is thoughtthat these enquiries have had a deterrent effect. Names and addresses of personsin the United Kingdom are often found in the possession of stowaways, but,although it is suspected that these are contact men who aid the stowaways on arrival, they are committing no offence and little effective action can be taken. TheMinistry have had discussions with those shipping companies who are particularlyburdened by stowaways, to devise special measures for preventing embarkation.One company recently tried posting members of the ship&apos;s crew in each hold duringloading operations. So far this has not prevented entirely the embarkation ofstowaways, but the scheme appears to be sound and other companies are beingurged to take similar action, although the companies point out that at ports whereaccess to the ships is practically unhindered at loading or at other times, it is impos- :sible for the ship&apos;s guard to be fully effective if dislocation to the ship&apos;s working isto be avoided.8. The Shipping Federation in their own interests and at the request of theMinistry have been keeping ship owners mindful of their responsibility; in 1948they issued a strongly worded circular to owners to remind their masters of the seriousness of the problem and the need to take all possible steps to mitigate it; in1949 the Shipping Federation, at the request of the Ministry, asked ship owners to prosecute all stowaways arriving in the United Kingdom on the ground that,although the prison sentence seemed to have little deterrent effect, arrest and detention-tion on arrival in this country helped to gain some measure of control over stowa-ways. The Shipping Federation have now, at the request of the Ministry, agreedto issue a further circular reminding ship owners in even stronger terms than those used in 1948 and 1949 that the ultimate responsibility for preventing unauthorisedembarkation lies with the ship&apos;s master. The Shipping Federation have from timeto time been asked to issue special warnings to ship owners about particular portswhere special watch needs to be kept. These have generally related to ports inforeign countries and in some cases the Foreign Office have also made representa-tions to the appropriate authorities. Since the carriage of stowaways involves theship owners in trouble, expense and inconvenience, the Minister of Transport con-siders that the ship owners have been doing all they reasonably can to keep down the traffic. In the Ministers view, the only final solution by administrative actionlies in reducing the evil at the ports of embarkation and he considers that for thispurpose all Departments concerned should encourage the fullest assistance andadministrative action from overseas authorities.9. One-trip seamen. The Ministries of Labour and Transport have examined in conjunction with the Shipping Federation and the National Union of Seamen.,the question whether any further action can be taken to reduce the influx of &quot; one-trip seamen.&quot; In the light of this examination the Minister of Labour and theMinister of Transport are satisfied that the British owners and the National Unionof Seamen are doing as much as can reasonably be expected of them in this matter.As regards foreign ships, however, they propose to arrange for an approach to theInternational Shipping Federation, through the United Kingdom Shipping Fed-eration, asking that members of the International Federation should refuse to acceptthe engagement of British Colonial seamen without repatriation rights.
