DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTanCP(73) 31 COPY NO        u 117 July 1973CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO 1977-78Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. When we fixed the programmes of public expenditure up to 1976-77for last December^ White Paper we recognised that the contingency reserve was virtually fully committed.    We agreed in January that wemust this year re-establish a fully adequate uncommitted reserve.2.        Comment on the White Paper showed broad agreement that ourmedium-term planning of public expenditure, in relation to growthprospects and other claims, was sound; but of course it was not knownto outside commentators that the so-called &quot;reserve&quot; was almost completely matched by foreseeable claims on it.3.        Such criticism as there was mainly concerned the short term.But we have met this by making the reductions which the Cabinet agreed and which I announced on 21 May,    Our argument that this should ensurethat there is room next year for exports and private investment to expandhas by and large been accepted by informed opinion.4.        We must now consolidate the sound position we have re-establised for this year and next in settling the rates of growth of public spending inthe later years of the period, from 1975-76 to 1977-78.5. The costings of the individual programmes up to 1977-78 which are set out in detail in the Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESC) report,already circulated, together with the uncommitted reserve we need, wouldtake the rate of growth of expenditure substantially above the levels we agreed and published only last December, for every year from 1975-76onwards.    The broad picture is shown in the attached graph.    Sizeablesums for the 1974 and later upratings of pensions and other social security benefits (5242 million in 1976-77), support for the railways ( 140 million)and for the coal industry (  70 million) have been included as realisticestimates of the likely cost of developing policies in these fields, butdecisions have yet to be taken on each of them.    The figures do not include  315 million (1976-77) of additional bids, of which the largestis for defence, which the Ministers concerned have proposed (see Annex b of the PESC Report).
6, I am sure my colleagues will appreciate why it is essential to beable to show, at this stage of this Parliament, and in an internationalcontext, that total public expenditure after 1974-75 will not exceed the levels published only last December, with a similar progression in thenew final year 1977-78.    More fundamentally, this is also what is requiredto conform with our economic and taxation prospects.    Unemployment hascome down very substantially, capacity is being more fully utilised, andthere is increasing talk of &quot;overheating&quot;.    In this situation and with the background of the recent depreciation of sterling, it would not be under-stood, either by our supporters in Parliament or by international opinion,if we were now to plan for a rate of growth of public expenditure higherthan that which we published last December.7.        I propose therefore that public expenditure for 1975-76 and 1976-77should be limited to the totals in last Decembers White Paper (Cmnd 5178)but including an adequate contingency reserve; and that the trend to 1977-78should be correspondingly adjusted.    The rate of increase of public expenditure in demand terms would then be around 3.0 per cent a year -that is, virtually the same figure as appeared in last December^ white paper,    This in turn would go far towards providing scope for personal consumption to grow over the 1972-78 period at an average rate of about.0 per cent a year.    Even on this basis, however, we must expect thatthe real burden of taxation would be increasing.8. In Jas&amp;uary when the Cabinet foresaw this situation they instructedofficials to consider modifications of policy for the individual expenditure programmes which would help to restore an adequate contingency reserve.The options which have been examined are summarised in Annex C of thePESC Report.    But I think we need to use that material selectively,, so asto serve our main objectives, including those for growth and counter-inflation, as effectively as possible,    I suggest therefore that the chief secretary and I should consider the possibilities, in consultation with our colleagues as necessary, and present the Cabinet in October with firm proposals for specific modifications of programmes.conclusions . I ask my colleagues to agree:a. That we should keep the rate of growth of public expenditurein the years up to 1976-77 to the totals published in last December&apos;white Paper, with a similar progression to 1977-78.b. That I should submit a report for decisions in October on themeans of achieving this.A treasury Chambers16 July 1973
