THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSELECT COMMITTEE ON SCOTTISH AFFAIRS -REPORT ON .LAND RESOURCE USE:DRAFT WHITE paper note by the Secretary of State for scotland. I am circulating with this note a draft White Paper for informationcontaining the Governments reply to the report on Land Resource Use inScotland published by the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs inOctober, 1972.2.        An earlier draft was circulated to members of the ministerial committee on Regional Policy and the Environment.    I have made anumber of changes in the text which I consider meet the various points made by them.    In particular, in view of the present stage of progress on the formulation of forestry policy, the passages dealing with forestryhave been redrafted in order to ensure that they do not prejudgecollective decisions which have still to be taken.    Subject to any commentsby my colleagues, by mid-August, I now propose to make arrangementsfor the publication of this White Paper in the early part of September.G scottish Office26 July 1973CP(73) 88 COPY NO26 July 1973CABINET

LtND RESOURCE USE IN scotland the GOVERNMENTS REPLY TO THE REPORT OP THE SELECT COiflllTTEE ON SCOTTISH AFFAIRSINTRODUCTION1.    The Select Committee lias produced a full and detailed report on ruraland urban land use in Scotland and has made wide ranging recommendationsconcerning both policies and machinery for town and country planning.The Government are grateful to the Committee for its analysis and have considered its Report and recommendations most carefully.2.    Part I of the Committee&apos;s Report deals with both urban and generalplanning.     It discusses the present planning system through which decisions are taken about the use of land and the information and manpower needed tosupport this system.   It proceeds to examine the public&apos;s involvementin the planning process, and certain aspects of land allocation.   Part ii of the Report deals specifically with rural land use and the countryside.In this reply it will be convenient first to set out the Government&apos;sresponse to the Committee&apos;s recommendations for improving the effectiveness of the machinery for1 taking decisions on the use of land; next to considerits recommendations on public participation; and then, after discussing the Committoe&apos;s proposals on a number of discrete but important subjects,to explain how the Government view the Committee1s remaining recommendations on the use of rural land.THE SYSTEM OF LAND USE PLANNINGGENERAL3.    From its analysis of the present system under which decisions are taken on the use of land the Committee concludes that, although planners,developers and the public have for the most part worked together in aco-operative fashion which has led to some real achievements, there is a need for more effort at the national level, devoted to giving greaterimpetus to positive planning and to securing better control and management of Scotland&apos;s physical resources.   To this end, the Committee recommends that there should be a national structure plan, embodying a national industrial strategy; that a more comprehensive and integrated view of urbanland use is required in order to raise the quality of urban environment;that all the bodies responsible for individual land uses in the countrysideshould be brought together in closer consultation so that their policiescoalesce, and that to assist in this process a multi-disciplinary planning staff with countryside skills and no sectoral interests should be assembled.
4.    The Committee proceeds to outline the new machinery which in its view isrequired.   There should hei.   a top level Working Parby to recommend the content of a structureplan for Scotland, including a national industrial strategy with asystem of advance zoning and acquisition of land for industrial purposes;ii.   a Commission for the Urban Environment to advise on urban environmentalstandards and how they may be achieved;iii.   a Land Use Council drawn from individuals of high standing end long experience to act as a central forum for discussion of rural land use and to make recommendations to the Government;iv.   a Land Use Unit of professional planners to give advice to ministers on present land use options and to warn of future difficulties,5.    The Government agree with the Committee that in the light of experiencethere is now room for improvement in the operation of the system for taking decisions on the use of land.   They agree that there is a need for more positive planning; that to enable this to be carried out more guidance mustbe given from the centre, on which the new regional authorities can base their structure plans; and that this guidance should include recommendedassumptions about population and economic growth, and about where broadlythis growth might take place.   They agree that much more must be done to improveand protect environmental quality in both town and country.   They agree toothat there should be even closer liaison between the central agencies(Government Departments, the Countryside Commission for Scotland, NatureConservancy Council and Forestry Commission) which are concerned withactivities in the countryside; end that those who use land in town and country(including industrialists, amenity bodies, landowners and1, farmers) should bemore elosely associated with decision-making, both locally and nationally.6.    Starting from this common ground, the Government have examined theCommittee&apos;s proposals most sympathetically.   After carefully studying them,however, they have concluded that the main institutional innovations proposedby the Committee would give rise to more problems than they would solve.Now independent bodies would be created and, whether these were givenexecutive functions or confined to an advisory role, their responsibilities would overlap or even conflict with those of existing bodies.   In particular,they would cut across the Secretary of State&apos;s statutory planning functions and also those of the local planning authorities.   Such machinery would not reflect the realities of land use planning, which is at present, and in the government&apos;s view must remain, a joint responsibility of elected central and local government, each reacting on the other.   Decisions in both developmentplanning and development control must continue to be taken by elected representatives: no appointed body, however eminent its members, ought to be invested with powers which conflict, or seem to conflict, with tins principle.The Government believe that the shortcomings identified by the Committeecan be rectified by making better use of -the existing -machinery, and by making two significant additions to it.   (See paragraphs 11, 12 and 15.)2.
7.    The Government accept responsibility for providing local planning authorities with as much central guidance as can usefully be given, and also for making this guidance generally available.   Already much has been done,and is being done, to prepare policy guidelines on matters which need tobe considered over Scotland as a whole.   Recent examples of such guidelinesare the advice given to local authorities on the assumptions they shouldmake about population growth in the next decade, and the discussion paper which lias been issued reviewing locations for oil production platforms.Such guidance must be kept under constant review in the light of new factors, including technological and social changes: for instance, eventwo years ago policies could not have taken account of the implications ofexploiting North Sea Oil.   And it cannot, unless exceptionally, specifyhow any particular area of land should be used: the local planning authorities must remain responsible for translating general guidanceinto specific land zoning.   ?or these reasons the. Government believe thata rigid national structure plan would be impracticable.   However, theyconsider that all the advantages underlying this concept can be achieved without a formal plan.   It is their intention to intensify the efforts to give central guidance, and to build up as quickly as possible a set ofguidelines on those aspects of land use which should be examined for scotland as a whole.   They also intend, as soon as this process permits, to drawthese guidelines together into a composite document, which they willpublish.   From time to time this document will be added to, and modified as necessary.   It would be misleading to call this a national structureplan, because inevitably it will be incomplete and imprecise: but the document will in time become a compendium of all that can usefully be said about the national framework for land use planning.   As such, it should prove increasingly valuable both to local planning authorities in preparingtheir own structure plans, and also to those with prospective demands for land.8.    The preparation of a formal national plan for locating industry presentseven greater difficulty than the devising of a national structure plan.Industrialists themselves cannot predict with confidence the rate and scale of their investment for more than a short period ahead,   \7hile government can adopt broad policies designed to create an economic climate favourable to expansion, the pace and type of development in particular locationsmust largely be determined by market forces and by the commercial judgementof individual enterprises.   In these circumstances the Government believethat their role is to continue and intensify the research and analysiswhich is being carried out in the Scottish Office, working with theDepartment of Trade and Industry.   The objective is to enable specificprojects to be considered against a background of broad planning policies and in the light of all relevant economic and environmental considerations.ACQUISITION OF LAND FOR INDUSTRYS.     .1th regard to securing land for industrial development, the government agree that, if it could be devised, it would be ideal to have a system underwhich prospective developers could be told at once what sites are availableto them.   Provision is at present made for the advance designation ofindustrial areas in local development plans.   Inevitably, however, someindustrial demands, particularly those arising from rapid technologicalchange, must come in advance of provision for them in development plans.Nor can every development plan provide in detail for all the different3.
types of industrial requirement that may arise.   In the past some development plans have not &quot;been made in time, or have not been kept up to date, butlocal authorities have now come to appreciate that more positive planning is needed to anticipate the demands of industry.   To assist them in this theGovernment will provide guidance on the locational requirements of majorindustries.   It will be the Secretary of State&apos;s policy to help and encourage the new local planning authorities at both levels to  identify theindustrial needs likely to arise in their areas; to zone in advance the landnecessary to meet those needs;   to make it clear to all industrialiststhat only on very good evidence will other land be zoned for their purposes;and to ensure that the zonings are fully reflected in arrangements for theprovision of infrastructure.10.   Both the Department of Trade and Industry and the local planning authorities already have power to acquire land for industrial development.The use of these powers wherever appropriate will be encouraged.   But theCrovernment consider it important not to spend large sums of public money onbuying sites which can be readily acquired by private enterprise, or siteswhich may not be developed in the immediate future.   Public purchase for industry. shou3.d be concentrated on land where compulsory powers are likely tobe necessaiy in order to assemble land in effective parcels, and whereearly development can be confidently expected.A STAITDING- C0K17ERENCE 0? EBG-IOHAI AUTHORITIES !11.   After local government reorganisation the new regional and islandsauthorities will be responsible for preparing strategic plans which will govern the use of land (both urban and rural), and guidance concerning industrial and land use planning must be addressed primarily to them.   The Secretaryof State now proposes, in preparing this guidance, actively to involve these new authorities.   He intends to invite each regional and islands authority tobe represented ,on a Standing Conference which will meet under Ministerialchairmanship.   One of its functions might well be to consider from time totime how the proposed planning framework of national guidelines can best be constructed and presented.12,   The intention is that the Standing Conference should draw upon advicenot only from inside central and local government but also from bodies suchas the Scottish Economic Council, the Nature Conservancy Council, the countryside Commission for Scotland, the Highlands &amp; Islands Development Boardand indeed from outside experts.   How this advice should be mobilised will befor discussion in detail in the Standing Conference; but, for example, itwould be possible for the Conference to establish working parties or sub-committees on strategic issues which arise in either the urban or the ruralcontext, and to co-opt to these working parties experts from the statutorybodies and from those who use the land.   In the period before this StandingConference can be set up, the Secretary of State will be preparing the wayby briEj^Lig together some of the statutory bodies for more systematic discussions,so enabling them to influence and share in the work already in progress onplanning the improvement of the urban and rural environment.AW URBAN COMMISSION13*   The Government are not persuaded that a new commission is needed inorder to create and maintain the right framework within which Scotland&apos;stowns can become more pleasant and attractive.   The existing machinery forthis purpose is adequate, if it is used with sufficient energy, thoughtfulnessand care.4.
14.   Local planning authorities, strengthened by local government reform, must bear the brunt of this work.     The Secretary of State intends to give them all possiblehelp and support from the centre.     High standards of visual quality can probablybest be promoted by example, combined with the appropriate scrutiny of specialprojects and the issue of advice by such bodies as the Royal Fine Art commission for Scotland.    However, there are many other environmental standards on which more specific guidance will be given.    These include appropriate densities ofdevelopment;   amounts of land needed for recreational and other social purposes;maximum acceptable levels of pollution;   and other objective criteria.     Aconsiderable amount of research remains to Tsia done to define such standards, buta great deal of it is in hand and the G-overnment do not believe that new bodies are required to initiate and carry out this work.    When research results havebeen taken to the point at which they can be applied, the need for policy decisions will arise.     In the Governmenfs view these decisions can be satisfactorily takenonly by the democratic processes of central and local government, and they see noplace for a new Committee in these processes.A STANDING COMMITTEE ON RURA3L MND USE15.   The new Standing Conference will itself provide for consultation on rural aswell as urban land use.     However, the Secretary of State proposes also to establish a standing group on which representatives of the 6 major agencies concerned withrural activities and environment - the Scottish Development Department, the ScottishEconomic Planning Department, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries forScotland, the Forestry Commission, the Nature Conservancy Council and the countryside Commission for Scotland, can discuss land use policies and can eachhave an opportunity to ensure that decisions take account of the various aspectsof land use which are Of major interest to it.    He will set up this new Land UseCommittee in advance of the Standing Conference.     The Committee will have thebenefit of association with the Scottish Economic Planning Board, so that land usemay be considered against the background of Scottish economic policy as a whole.This will, for example, facilitate consideration (as recommended in the Report)of the regional development aspects of afforestation, before final decisions are taken.    The Committee will also provide a forum for the discussion of varioustopics which the Select Committee suggested would be suitable for considerationby a Land Use Council.ACTION AT LOCAL LEVEL16.   These arrangements for consultation and co-ordination at a national level willbe complemented by the attention which the new local authorities will wish to devoteto environmental control and management.    The Select Committee recommended that all local planning authorities be required to set up &quot;environmental management committees&quot;and that authorities covering rural areas be required to set up &quot;countryside committees&quot;The new local authorities will indeed have po?/er to appoint such committees ifthey wish, although the Government would not consider it appropriate to require them to do so since the new councils should be free to adopt whatever form ofinternal organisation and management structure they find most suitable for these purposes.    The Government will certainly encourage local planning authoritiesto build into their development planning, at both regional and local levels,policies which reflect a co-ordinated approach to environmental management,whether in a rural or an urban setting.5.
PLANNING AND THE PUBLICC1NERAL17.     The Committee regards it as essential that care and attention shouldbe paid &quot;by planning authorities to achieving and retaining- the public&apos;confidence in their proposals, and that participation by the public iscrucial in attaining this aim.     They make five specific recommendations to promote improvement.. ...... - ii    /,i.     The Secretary of State should review the effectiveness of the many recent experiments in public participation.ii.     Applicants for planning permission should be required to notifyadjacent proprietors.iii.     A committee should be set up to examine the existing inquiryprocedures and to recommend how these can be streamlined and aochome of financial assistance to objectors implemented.iv.     Pending the outcome of the report from this committee theSecretary of State should use his powers to award expenses toobjectors;v.     The role of the Planning Inquiry Commission should be evaluated.18.     The Government agree with the Committee in attaching importance tothe need for planning authorities to enjoy the public&apos;s confidence.     Thiswill be more readily achieved if the roles of various participants in the planning process are clearly appreciated.     It is the role of the local planning authority with the help of the applicants to satisfy itself that proposals put forward by prospective developers are acceptable within the agreed planning framework for the area.     In some cases it may be necessaryfor the authority or the developer (or both together) to carry out a vigorous analysis of the proposals on the area and to describe the alternatives considered.     It is then for those members of the public con-corned to state to the deciding authority the possible impact of the proposalsor the alternatives on them.     Tho essential purpose of the public local inquiry is to bring together these two parties;   those who can explain theproposals and alternatives in detail and those who wish to state the effecton them or those they represent.     It is inappropriate that public localinquiries should be regarded as putting upon individuals or groups the task of presenting alternative proposals or conducting expert cross-examinationon matters on which they themselves cannot have any specialist knowledge.The Government accept that local authorities in the past may not have fully appreciated their role in this process and that this may have led to individuals and groups not merely stating their own objections but alsoframing alternative proposals.     To avoid this it is the Governments policyfirst to secure the progressive improvement in the quality of development plans so that they can serve as an adequate background against which anyproposal can be assessed;   and secondly to impress on local authorities thatit is their responsibility to carry out an adequate appraisal of theenvironmental impact of any major proposal for development and of any
alternatives that may he appropriate.     In the light of these general considerations the Governments views on the Committee&apos;s specific recommendations are as follows.i&quot;     A Review of the Effectiveness of Recent Public Participation19.   The Government intend to promote more effective means of public debateabout general planning matters.     For instance, they propose in the LocalGovernment (Scotland) Bill to establish a machinery for public examinationsinstead of public inquiries, when substantial issues are raised by structureplans.     The experience of local authorities with their experiments in public participation since the publication of the Skeffington Report willbe a valuable source of information about other improvements which can bemade, and local planning authorities have been asked to submit reports ontheir experience.ii. Notification of Adjacent Proprietors20.   The Government do not consider it desirable to give, neighbours aspecial place in relation to planning.     They have a special place inrelation to building regulations applications, because the manner of buildingmay affect the specific legal interests of a neighbouring proprietor, forexample by causing flooding of his land.     Problems of this kind are likelyto affect only neighbours.     Planning decisions, however, do not affectmatters on which individuals might have recourse to the Courts for damages,and an individual has no special claim to exercise influence over the useof adjacent land in which he has no legal interest, or over development whichdoes not affect any interest he dould pursue in a Court.     The case fornotifying planning applications to others rests on the prospect that somedevelopments or uses of land may affect the living and working conditions ofa number of people.     General advertisement is therefore the appropriate method of making such proposals known.     The Government propose to supple-ment the present requirements for general advertisement by a new requirement that proposed developments must be advertised on sites.     This will be ofparticular benefit to those living nearby.iii. The Streamlining of Existing Planning Procedures21.   The Government accept that inquiries often take too long, and they areintensifying their efforts to expedite decisions.     In the Governmenfsview the most significant improvement would be achieved by the circulation of written evidence in advance of the inquiry, and by brevity in allexpression and cross-examination at the inquiry.     The Secretary of state has pressed all parties to take action on these lines, and this pressurewill be sustained.     It is essential however to strike the right balance between the need for a quick decision and the need to ensure fairness bypreserving the proper rights of the individuals or bodies concerned.     Thisis a matter of judgement for the Government 5   they do not consider that an examination of inquiry procedures by a committee would help, but they will themselves seek to improve existing practices.
iv.   Financial Assistance to Objectors22.   On the question of expenses, when it is accepted that the object ofpublic inquiries is not to enable the public to pro&amp;on-t alternative planningproposals but to give those affected by a specific proposal the opportunityof stating its possible impact on them, much of the expense of inquiries to private individuals will disappear;   their need for export witnesses andindpendent investigation will greatly diminish, as may also their need forlegal representation.     Some expenses will remain, however, and the questionis whether persons who legitimately and reasonably object to planningproposals should be awarded their expenses.     At the present time anobjector to a compulsory purchase order (cp) whose objections are successful,either wholly in that the order is not confirmed or partly in that the order is modified, is awarded expenses in proportion to his degree of success.However, there is a distinction to be drawn between cp inquiries and planninginquiries :   anyone entitled to object to a cp must have a clear and substantial interest in the land, but an objector to a planning proposalneed have no legal interest in the land whose development he seeks tocontrol.     It is reasonable that the planning objector should be given theopportunity of expressing his views about development affecting thecommunity to which he belongs, but it is unreasonable that, when none ofhis own legal rights or interests is at stake, he should be able -attaxpayers&apos; expense to supplement his arguments with those of specialists and experts employed expressly to safeguard what he conceives to bo his interests,or perhaps merely to promote his personal opinion about the appropriatedevelopment of the area.     The distinction between thoso whose legal rightsor interests are at staJ.ce and others was recognised and approved by theCouncil on Tribunals in 1964* and the Council have not felt impelled since then to revise their recommendation on this point.23.   The Committee considers that there is a special case for assistingamenity bodies to appear at the public inquiries because they ensure thatin the general public interest the claims of conservation arc taken fully into account.     Some of tho amenity bodies have been, or are being,assisted financially by tho Government to carry out certain work of survey and assessment in the public interest, and this can be made available tolocal planning authorities without the need for an inquiry.     But it cannotbe assumed that the planning authorities uncler-rato the amenity aspect of planning problems in comparison with other aspects, or that amenity societiesalways promote the wider public interest.     Some societies have a narrowlocal base, while others exist to promote a view of conservation and visualamenity which, however sincere and commendable, may not be widely shar 1 tothe same degree.     In all those circumstances the Government do notconsider it practicable to differentiate in the matter of expenses betwee -amenity societies and other groups of objectors.24*   Por these reasons the Government cannot accept the Committee&apos;recommendation that the Secretary of State should now use his powers to award expenses to objectors.8.
9.25,   The Committee commends the concept of tho Planning Inquiry Commissionembodied in the Town &amp; Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972, with itsstrengthening of the Reporter&apos;s function by the addition of expert technicalassessors, and recommends that a special study group should investigate how to introduce Planning Inquiry Commissions for all major inquiries in Scotlandand how this might affect the arguments for and against having full-timereporters *26.   There is little experience from which to evaluate the role of PlanningInquiry Commissions.     Provision was made for them in legislation primarily in order to deal with development of exceptional technological complexityproducing a demand for which sites in various parts of the country could beappropriately considered.     Because thoy are time-consuming and expensive itis unlikely that such Commissions can be frequently used.     In the LocalGovornment (Scotland) Bill, however, the main features of the PlanningInquiry Commission have been incorporated in the machinery proposed for thopublic examination of structure plans.     When this machinery is in use theGovernment will consider how effective it proves, and whether its application should be extended.27.   Since Planning Inquiry Commissions will be infrequent they do not affect the case for or against full-time Reporters in Scotland.     In viewof the steadily increasing number of planning inquiries in Scotland, theSecretary of State has accepted the need for some full-time Reporters, andthey have been recruited.     For the time being they will certainly not boable to deal with all inquiries, and It is doubtful whether it will overbe economical to have a full-time staff sufficient for that purpose, sincethe incidence of inquiries varies considerably from time to time.     TheGovernment intend, however, that the full-time corps should eventually dealwith a significant proportion of inquiries, including most of the majorinquiries.
SUPPORT FOR THE PLANNING SYSTEM28.   The Committee made a number of rooommondet-biaris designed, to improve- oupportfor the planning system through better information and more adequate staffing.INFORMATION29.   The Committee proposed that the Local Government Central iidvisory Unitshould establish a Working Party to make specific recommendations about the content and organisation of the information system required for structure planning in Scotland.The Government welcome the Committee&apos;s interest and concern.     Much work has alreadybeen done, and more is in hand, in this regard.     A Government study of generalinformation systems for planning (GISP), was published last year.     On the basis ofthe study the Secretary of State circularised local planning authorities, outliningprobable action and indicating that there would be further consultations with them.The full system envisaged in the GISP Report implies a research and development programme extending over several years.     Consultation-3 about this are proceeding on a Great Britain basis and the Scottish local authority associations areparticipating.    Arrangements are also in hand for a Working Party of central andlocal government representatives to plan the progressive improvement andstandardisation of the systems of gathering, maintaining and using planning datain Scotland;   and preliminary guidance was given to local planning authorities in2 technical advice notes in the latter half of 19721.     In the Government&apos;s view theseare the most profitable ways of making progress.    They do not believe that information systems for structure planning are an appropriate subject forconsideration by the Local Government Central Advisory UnliJ at this stage,STAFFING30.   The Committee recommend that the Scottish Development Department should take several measures to improve the staffing of Scottish local planning authorities,specifically by obtaining regular information on the planning manpower situation;implementing structure planning at the earliest possible date in order to improve the prospects for planners in Scotland;   employing specialist consultants ormobile teams to work alongside local planning staff;   and taking other steps toimprove the number, quality and diversity of town and country planning staff inScotland,31,   On the Secretary of State&apos;s behalf the Department keeps in regular touch with local planning authorities about the development planning needs of their areas and about the staffing.and recruiting situation as it affects planning performance.It will continue to do so.     It would not be appropriate however, for CentralGovernment to maintain the kind of statistics suggested by the Committee:   this may well be a task which the National Joint Councils for Local authority services will wish to undertake.32.   As regards the early introduction of the structure planning provisions ofthe 1969 Act, the timing of the preparation of structure plans in each areamust depend largely on the circumstances of that area.     Local planning authorities have been given an indication of the necessary preliminary action,and timing has been discussed in direct consultation between Central Governmentofficers and local planning authorities.    To the extent that commencementorders bringing Part II of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1972 intooperation have not been made by 15 May 1975, they will be made for the remainder of the country on that date.10
33.   For the rest, it would be inappropriate for Central G-overnment to take direct action which trenched upon responsibilities proper to the local authorities themselves.    B; is the responsibility of local planning authorities to ensure thatthey have adequate qualified staff to carry out their statutory functions.Governments have helped by giving considerable encouragement in recent years tothe growth of courses connected with planning and, particularly in Scotland, thenumber qualifying annually as planners has substantially increased.     TheGovernment have urged local planning authorities to take full advantage of theadditional numbers of qualified planners available and, in preparation for localgovernment reorganisation, they have arranged special training for middlfjmanagement local authority planners already in post.     It is for local planning authorities to decide whether or not to employ consultants, and in whatcircumstances, but the Government have frequently drawn to the attention of theauthorities the advantage of using consultants in appropriate circumstances, and authorities are making increasing use of consultants.3k,   The Committee also recommended that a new Land Use Unit of professionalplanners should be established to give advice to Ministers and to service theproposed Land Use Council.     The Government do not see a need for such a Unit,operating outside Departments and statutory agencies.    They intend to ensure thatthe Secretary of State&apos;s planning staff, and those of the agencies, are fully adequate to undertake the analyses of land use problems, and the forward thinking,to which (like the Committee) they attach importance.    They will also ensure thatthese professional officers are enabled to keep in close touch with the work andideas of outside experts.11
IMPROVING- THE LAND ALLOCATION PROCESSiJ5. The Committee considered that measures should be taken to improve the processthrough which land is allocated and used f or d evelopment by:-i    designating modestly sized New Towns outside the Central Belt, inthe Moray Eirth, the North East and the Borders;ii    producing and publishing a land ownership register;iii     making it obligatory for all planning authorities in coalfield areas to consult the National Coal Board about sites scheduled for development.(i) The Designation of New Towns outside the Central Belt360     The Government share the Committee&apos;s view that the New Town Corporations inScotland have been remarkably successful in contributing to economic growth andin creating towns of high environmental quality.37.     One factor which the Government consider has been very important in theeconomic growth of Scottish New Towns is the availability of overspill populationfor labour supply.     Not only have the Towns had considerable interchange of pop-ulation daily with neighbouring communities, but as they have grown the movementof population to thera (whether through planned overspill agreements or voluntarily)has been facilitated by proximity to Glasgow or other populous centres and thepossibility of commuting in the event of employment and housing provision beingout of phase at times.     The success of the Scottish New Towns derives in large part from their lying within a large labour market and within reach of the servicefacilities or a heavily urbanised area.38.     These requirements for the successful development of New Towns do not atpresent exist in the Moray Eirth area, the North East or the Borders, and theGovernment do not contemplate setting up New Towns there in existing circumstances.However, they will mtch closely the developing effects of the discovery of north sea oil, and of local government reorganisation,- in case another New Town shouldlater be justified,(ii) A Land Ownership H&amp;giater39.    Eor most planning purposes the valuation roll is an adequate register ofinterest in land.    Eor some purposes more details of superior interests arerequired, and it is then necessary to consult the General Register of Sasines,which forms the chief record in Scotland of rights in land.     However, thepurpose of this register is to enable any prospective purchaser to satisfy himself that the title to the land is good.     The reorganisation of the Register to providea comprehensive and up to date record set out by area rather than individualproperty would be a massive operation.    The Government are not satisfied thatthe planning benefits to be gained would justify this work.(iii) Consultation with the National Coal Board40.    The Government have been giving thought to the arrangements governing damage from, and compensation for, mining subsidence, and they will take the Committee&apos;srecommendations fully into account in their further consideration of these arrangements.
DERELICT LAND41*     The Committee expressed the view that more could be done by Government toencourage local authorities to remove past dereliction and prevent new disfigure-ment.     It recommended specifically chat(i)     the grant level of 85 par cent should be increased;(ii)     more flexible arr&amp;ngsffionta should be made to enable grants to bepaid to statutory undertakers and even private firms in some circumstances-stances;   and(iii)     in the case of new mineral workings by private enterprise some form ofbinding agreement that ensures finance for rehabilitation should be insisted upon by the planning authorities.i42.    The Government embarked early in 2972 on a campaign to expedite the clearance of derelict land and have been greatly encouraged by the response made by many localauthorities to the practical help in money and advice which has been offered tothem.    They intend to continue this campaign, and they have considered whetherimplementation of the Committee^ throe recommendations would increase its impetus.The grant level43.    The rate of specific grant is already very high, and the balance of cost not so met qualifies for additional assistance through the resources element of rate support grant, which can bring the combined grant to as much as 95$ of the net costof a scheme.    All ancillary costs, including those of land acquisition, surveys,professional fees and additional expenditure on staff necessarily engaged by thelocal authority for reclamation works, qualify for grant.     This represents a verygenerous degree of help, and the Government do Hot accept that it would be rightto relieve local authorities of the entire cost of rehabilitation..&apos; -(ii) More flexible arrangements for grants to statutory undertakers and privatefirms44.    The Government do not believe that arrangements of this kind would signifi-oantly promote the clearance of dereliction.     Statutory undertakers and private firms are unlikely to find the work attraetive under the conditions which would be essential in order to protect the public purse.     For example, the after use ofthe restored land would have to conform to the development plan;   and the increasein the value of the land would have to be deducted from the expenditure whichwould otherwise be eligible for grant, and the after value of reclaimed land -particularly if the new use were to be commercial or industrial - would oftenexceed the cost of the works so that no grants would be payable.    Moreover private owners are unlikely to be interested in the rehabilitation of land purely for theimprovement of amenity, without any economic return, and most derelict land issusceptible only of this kind of treatment.     Even where some economic return ispossible this cannot accrue for a long time, because clearance necessarily involvesmuch survey and preparatory work, and the delay would be unacceptable to mostfirms.(iii) New mineral workings:   binding agreements to rehabilitate land45.    This matter is under consideration at present by the Committee under thechairmanship of Sir Roger   Stevens which is reviewing the planning c control of mineral working, and pending its report the Government can express no view.
RURAL LAND USE46.     The Committee1s proposals for a Land Use Council, a land use Unit and Local Countryside Committees have already beendiscussed.     In Part II of their Report the Committee made anumber of other recommendations about rural land use and the countryside.     After studying these with care the Governmenthave reached the following conclusions.FORESTRY47.     The Committee made a number of recommendations onafforestation.     These related to control over the planting of land,not hitherto used for trees, by private groups or individualsas well as by the Forestry Commission:   to the size of the planting programme undertaken by private growers:   and to the future grantarrangements for private forestrys    All these are matters whichare being considered as part of the review of forestry which isbeing undertaken by the Government following the publication of the consultative document on forestry policy, and on which consultationsare proceeding with the many interests concerned.     In this reviewof forestry policy, the Government is taking account of the views expressed by the Committee.     Conclusions on the review will be announced as soon as possible.48.     The Committee also drew attention to the benefits which mightbe obtained through a good integration between forestry and agriculture and to the need to bear in mind the probable effects of afforestation on amenity and ecology.    As indicated inparagraph 15 above, the Forestry Commission will be represented on the proposed Standing Committee on Rural Land Use and thiswill provide a forum to enable the wider effects of afforestationto be considered in relation to their impact on other land usesand on the countryside.14
CENTRES OP RESOURCE MANAGEMENT49*   The Report indicates that the Committee obtained no clear view on therespective merits of multi-purpose and specialist enterprises and they therefore recommended that experiments in management should be undertaken   :on a number of estates already in public OY/nership, with a view todemonstrating the benefits, costs and limitations of integrated as opposedto specialised enterprises.   Having regard to the amount of work..alreadygoing on in this field, including experiments mentioned by the Committeeboth on private and publicly owned land, there does not appear to be strongjustification for adopting the Committee&apos;s recommendation.   Such questions asthe development of public recreational facilities, the farming of red deer,and the integration of forestry and agriculture arc already being studied in different localities and it is hoped that the results of such studies willprovide sufficient information to enable informed decisions to be taken onthe allocation of land to different uses within an estate.MUI3BURN50. ,The Committee recommended that the present regulations on Muirburn shouldbe examined and the Nature Conservancy should consider., together with farmers and gamekeepers, means of promoting the best possible practice.   TheGovernment will consult the Nature Conservancy Gouncil and other interests about this.AGRICULTURAL GRANTS(i) Monitoring of the Effects of Agricultural Grants5i.   The Committee recommended the monitoring of the results achieve! by agricultural grants.   To maintain monitoring on an individual farm basis would be very costly in staff, time, and resources, but the economic value ofthe Farm Capital Grant Scheme as a whole is kept under continuous review bythe Government,   Guidance to assist farmers in deciding on the mostbeneficial investments is available from the staff of the AgriculturalColleges; this advice has regard to the results of research and developmentcarried out in Scotland and elsewhere.(ii) Recovery of Grants paid in respect of land later afforested52,   There is no general prescriptive right to reclaim grant (other than forfalse claim, bad work or undue delay) in tho legislation which authorises thoFarm Capital Grant Scheme.   Powers of recovery under tho Hill Farming aridLivestock Rearing Acts are also limited and it has not been the practice toseok repayment where land goes to afforestation.   The forestry enterprisemay indeed obtain benefit from land improvement or building undertaken or pro-vided with grant-aid.   The decision to sell land for forestry usually followssome change of circumstance not foreseen when the grant was applied for and paid; and insistence on repayment couli introduce a rigidity which might wellwork against rather than facilitate the best land use.   The Government wouldnot, however, rule out consideration of recovery of grant paid where in allthe circumstances this appeared to bo justified.15.
(iii) Grants for Agriculture/Forestry Roads in Upland Areas53.   The Committee recommended that specific grants should bo given for unsurfacedworking roads in uplani areas of joint benefit to agriculture an! forestryoperations.   It is accepted that roads primarily for forestry use in uplandareas would almost invariably have some agricultural value.   At tho same time this value would in most cases bo limited anl well below a level which couldbe accepted as justifying an apportionment of cost for grant ail under the FarmCapital Grant Scheme.   In cases, however, where agriculture can be shown to benefit to a significant extent by the provision of a road mainly for thebenefit of forestry, agricultural grant can be given on that part of thetotal cost reasonably attributable to agriculture.COUNTRYSIDE PLANNINGCOUNTRY PARKS!54.   The Committee recommended a more liberal approach to the designation of&apos;country parks&apos; in Scotlanl, suggesting that they should not necessarily haveto be close to major centres of population.   The Government wall bear thisrecommendation in mini against the time when new countryside legislation isunder consideration.   They will also wish to study closely the submission whichis being prepared by the Countryside Commission for Scotland about the pattern of parks for Scotland as a whole.THE RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRYSIDE COMMISSION FOR SCOTLAND55.   The Committee recommended that the Countryside Commission for Scotland&apos;staff and financial resources should be increased in order to enable it to lendmore support to the recreational and countryside planning activities of localauthorities.   The Government will continue to keep under continuous review7the level of the Commission&apos;s staff anl financial resources and to adjust them from time to time in the light of the development of the Commission&apos;s work.The reorganisation of local government in Scotland will produce more powerfulauthorities and, oven in the areas where high scenic beauty goes hand in handwith low rateable value, the larger authorities will be better able to employmore qualified staff.   This may well relieve the Commission of some of itsincreasing burden, but a close watch will be kept on this during theformative years of the new authorities.THE ROLE OF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY56,   The Government sympathise with the view of the Committee that ways shouldbe sought to increase the part played by the Nature Conservancy in givingadvice to planning authorities in the formulation and implementation of theirstructure plans.   Under the Nature Conservancy Council Act which has just been passed the existing Nature Conservancy Committee of the Natural EnvironmentResearch Council will be succeeded by the Nature Conservancy Council, withfunctions which include those of providing advice to Ministers on policies for or affecting, nature conservation anl of disseminating knowledge about natureconservation.   When the new Council has been set up the Committee&apos;s recommenda-tion will be discussed with it, and the Government will give tho Council all reasonable support in developing its advisory role.16.
CONCLUSION57*   The Government accept the Committee1s general conclusion that the operationof the system for taking decisions on the use of lanl in Scotland should nowbe improved.   In particular they agree with the Committee that, in view of recentincreases in the pressure on lanl, planning should be even more positive; thatgrowing public awareness of the importance of the environment calls for stillnore effort to be devoted to conserving and improving its quality; and thatthose who use both urban and rural lanl should be enabled to participate moreactively in the decision-making process.58.   They believe however that these agreed objectives can be attained bysimpler and more direct adaptations of the existing planning arrangements thanthose proposed by the Committee.   Thus they intend to build up as quickly aspossible a set of guidelines on those aspects of land use which should boexamined for Scotland as a whole, and to draw these guidelines together into asingle iocument which they will publish as,a national framework for land use planning.   This central guidance will include advice on the locationalrequirements of major iniustries.   It will bo kept under continuous review, andwill be added to, and modified, from time to time.   To assist him in preparingthis guidance the Secretary of State for Scotland intends to appoint, after localgovernment reorganisation, a Standing Conference of the new regional authorities,and to mobilise through it alvice not only from local government and the centralagencies but also from outside experts.   In advance of setting up this conference the Secretary of State will establish a standing group of the majorGovernment agencies conccrne.1 with rural planning, in which advice and action can be co-ordinated.   The Secretary of State also shares the Committee&apos;s desire that Scotland1s towns shoull be made more pleasant and attractive, and he intends to provide more specific guidance on the environmental standards which local planning authorities should adopt.59*   It is common ground that more should be done to ensure that planning authorities enjoy public confidence.   The Government intend to promote more effective means of public debate about general planning natters.   They willalso press for better local development plans, and for adequate appraisals ofthe environmental impact of major development proposals.   These improvementswill in themselves help to shorten proceedings when inquiries are necessary,but 1 the Government are intensifying their efforts to expedite decisions:they accept the case made by the Committee for appointing some full-timeReporters to take a proportion of the inquiries, and the Secretary of state has now recruited a small permanent staff for this purpose.60.   The Government are confident that these changes, together with thogeneral introduction of the structure planning provisions of the Town and country planning (Scotland) Act 1972, and the reorganisation of local government, willsubstantially improve the quality of decisions about the use of land inScotland.   They repeat their thanks to the Committee for its Iloport, in thelight of \?hich they intend to take the steps described in this Paper,17.
