DRAFT WHITE PAPERPOLICE/EMIGRANT RELATIONS IN ENGLAND AND WALESOBSERVATIONS ON THE REPORT OP THE SELECTCOMMITTEE ON RACE RELATIONS AND IMMIGRATION1.     The need to foster good relations between the. police and the immigrant communities is a matter of great importance to all who wish to see a just and harmonious society in Britain: it is not amatter of concern to the police alone.     The Government thereforewelcome the Select Committee&apos;s report, which constitutes a notableand constructive contribution to discussion of a topic which,regrettably, tends to give rise to more emotion than illumination.Apart from the report itself, the volumes of evidence contain aunique collection of views and attitudes from a wide variety ofsources.    In this field, what people believe to be the truth maybe as important as the truth itself.   Prejudice, as the Committeeobserve, feeds on myth and rumour, whether it be against immigrantsor on the part of immigrants.2,     The arrival over the last couple of decades of significantnumbers of immigrants settling in this country has confronted thepolice, as it has other bodies,with a novel situation.   The police are the first to admit that difficulties have arisen and that areasof tension continue to exist.    The select Committee&apos;s report make sit clear, however, that in many respects the challenge is beingsuccessfully met.   The Government are glad to note and to endorse the tributes paid by the Committee to what the police service hasachieved.    The Government will also make renewed efforts to tackle1
cLthe problems in those areas where the-Committee have pointed topersisting difficulties.     The Gommitteeis report has been carefully studied in the police service, and account is already being taken of the Committee^ recommendations in the planning of future police activity.3.     The report rightly stresses that immigrants are not in themselves a problem to the police.     There is absolutely no evidence to support suggestions that the great majority of immi-grants are anything other than hard-working, law-abiding citizens.   *One source of difficulty has inevitably been the unfamiliarity tonewcomers of-the ways of this country and its institutions.Misunderstandings arise through misconceptions about the positionof the police here - about the extent of their duties and the limitations on their powers; and equally, on the police side,misunderstandings arise through difficulties of communication, with new immigrants.if.     Experience and understanding acquired with the passage of time will help overcome these difficulties.     The police pride themselves on their record of impartiality towards all sections of thecommunity regardless of distinctions of background, and wouldrightly resist any suggestion that there should be special treatment for immigrants.   This is not to say, however, that the police can afford to ignore the special circumstances of different groups.This applies throughout society and not just to police relationswith immigrant groups.   There is an increasing recognition of theneed for policemen to have a sophisticated grasp of the nature of2
modern society.   It is not enough - and no doubt never was- forthe police merely to know and enforce the law.   They need an adequateunderstanding of the aspirations and&apos;frustrations of the different sections of the community in which they move if they are to estab!lishthe mutual trust, on which successful policing depends.   Immigrationhas been an important phenomenon in recent years and special attention has to be given by tbe police to its consequences.   such measures as the appoinlment of police community liaison officers topromote understanding and establish links with the immigrant 1communities are examples of this.    They in no way imply thatimmigrants are singled out for specially favourable treatment: theyare no more than a recognition that police/immigrant relations area matter on which specific attentibhcisJnecessary.5.    Heavy demands are made of the police in the modern world, andthe Committee rightly stress that they cannot be expected to carrythese responsibilities without adequate training.    Increasingattention is now devoted to broadening the content of the traininggiven to the police and the restructuring of courses has takenaccount of the need to include adequate time for police/immigrantrelations.6.     The police need an understanding of the backgrounds of thedifferent immigrant communities and the factors involved inimmigration.     They need an understanding^too, of the situation inwhich immigrants find themselves in this country - the economic aidsocial factors which have led to immigrant concentration in innercity areas with their problems of social deprivation.   The problems
of these areas lie right outside the power of the police to affectbut inevitably, as visible representatives of authority, they find themselves held in some sense responsible.7. Problems such as bad housing and lack of leisure facilities are problems which government, local and central, and society at large, have to tackle, but they form an important element in the context in which the police have to work.   The Government recognise:0this.   Social improvements benefit police work, while thepersistence of intractable social problems creates difficultieswhich the police are powerless to solve by their own efforts.8.     It would be idle and dangerous to pretend that relationsbetween police and immigrants create difficulties only for thoseimmigrants who are new to this country and that time will necessarilysolve all the problems. Difficulties arise with young coloured people inparticular, and many of these were, born here or came here as smallchildren and have spent their formative years here.   These, thesecond generation, who are not immigrants at all, have their owndifficulties, growing up in two cultures, that of their parentsand that of the larger society around them.     But as British bornand bred they rightly expect to be accepted on the same terms asothers regardless of colour-.   This is a challenge to society as a whole and we cannot yet claim that we are meeting it as well as we should. Thepolice are of course only one element of the society which isconfronted by this challenge.   While part of the tfcst is the extentto which coloured people are treated by the police on the same terms as white   people, any failure of the rest of society, in4
employment, in housing and elsewhere, to aocept coloured citizenson equal terms would undermine the efforts made by the police and leave them facing forms of discontent which spring fcorn causesoutside their control.9.     It is worth remembering that the police have over the years had difficulties with different groups of young people - who have often been easily identifiable by dress or appearance and whosecollective behaviour has given cause for offence to the public at large.   Only a small minority of young coloured reople are affectedby this confrontation with the police.   Some groups, apparentlyanxious to imitate behaviour amongst the black community in theUnited States^ themselves provoke the difficulties.   It is important to ensure that the problems created for the police in dealing withgroups :-of this sort do not affect police attitudes to the majorityof, law-abiding coloured youngsters.10.   It is quite clear from.the evidence gathered by the SelectCommittee that great efforts are being made.both by the police andby the immigrant communities to improve mutual understending.The Government welcome and support these efforts.   It is particularlyheartening to note that they also have the full support of thePolice Federation, which has itself taken a number of valuableinitiatives in this fielS.    The report rightly emphasises thatthere can be no quick or easy solution to all problems, that onlyconstant constructive effort on Lboth sides can succeed.     Bad newswill:-,catch headlines end become exaggerated, good hews is all toooften inconspicuous and only brought out into the open by
investigation such as that carried out by the Select Committee,The police have a long tradition of involvement in the affairs ofthe community, both on and off duty,&apos;   It is this involvement,outside the immediate stresses and frictions of law enforcement,which fosters understanding and confidence between the local police and their community.     It is indispensable to attempts to improvepoliee/immigrant relations.   It would not be right, however, to givethe impressidn that the onus rests only on one side.     The SelectCommittee leave no doubt about the need for immigrants themselvesto make their contribution, as indeed a great many do,11,   The G-overnment1 s views on the recommendations in Chapter 15of the report are set out in the Annex,
ANNEXOBSERVATIONS ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS OP THE SELECT COMMITTEEThe recommendations made by the Select Committee are set out in paragraph343 in Chapter 15 of its report.   They are reproduced below with comment:.; v. v jr.on each.(l) &quot;The facts about immigrant crime rates should be brought firmlyto the attention of all police officers&quot; (paragraph 243) *Comment - The Government have noted with interest the evidence from severalpolice sources given to the Se3.ect Committee that crime rates in the immigrant community are no higher than, and in some cases significantlylower than, those for the indigenous population and will draw it to theattention of chief officers of police.
(2) &quot;Local authorities should be urged to make use of statutory powersto assist in the construction of licensed clubs and community facilities&quot;(paragraph 21+6).(3) &quot;Pending possible changed in.the licensing laws, present policepolicy of &quot;containment&quot; of shebeens should be continued&quot; (paragraph 246).Comment   - There is no.evidence that local authorities are reluctant, inappropriate circumstances, to use their powers to assist in the constructionof clubs and community facilities. Licensing of such facilities is amatter for local magistrates&apos; courts or licensing justices, who will normally take local circumstances into account in dealing with applications.It is not clear, however, that an increase in the provision of licehsedpremises would significantly ease the problems presented by &quot;shebeens&quot;.The attraction of &quot;shebeens&quot; or any other party held on private premiseswould appear to lie largely in the facilities they offer well into the night and early hours of the morning, as paragraph 245 of the Committee&apos;sreport recognises.    It would seem doubtful whether a club with aconventional drinking licence and rules about noise, music and entertainmentwould be seen as an attractive alternative.The enforcement of the existing law is a matter for the chief officer of police concerned.
(4)        &quot;Lost or mutilated passports are too easily replaced.    The issue of replacement passports should be discussed between the Foreign and commonwealth office, the Home Office and the High Commissions in London&quot; (paragraph 248)0Comment -  The Government are very well.aware of the potential evasion of immigration control which this practice can foster.    But the consular function of issuing passports referred to in Article 5* paragraph (d) of the ViennaConvention on Consular Relations 1963 is not subject to any restriction, andthe representatives of foreign and Commonwealth Governments in the UnitedKingdom are not under any duty to the host Government to refrain from issuingpaasports in certain circumstances, or to consult that Government before doing so for fear of inhibiting its administration of the immigration laws.    We forour part would not; wish our missions and consulates to be under any suchobligationFurthermore, possession of a passport issued in this country does notabsolve a person admitted on conditions from the need to comply with those conditions, nor does it make him immune from prosecution for breach of them or make a person who has entered illegally immune from prosecution for thatoffence or immune from removal.The Home Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office have discussed this problem with the Diplomatic&apos; Missions in London of.-the countries concerned,and they will continue their efforts to see whether the risk of evasion ofcontrol can be reducedo
( ) &quot;The police should get fuller and quicker information about personsoverstaying their entitlement&quot; (paragraph 2hS),Comment - The Government accept that cases calling for police investigationshould be brought to the attention of the police promptly when departmentalenquiries have failed.   The procedure is being reviewed to see whether&apos;.it--canbe speeded up-     When a person is known to be in breach of the conditions governing his stay, enquiries are usually made by the Home Office at the address last known to them and s^ubsequantly at other addresses which these enquiries may suggest.   In some cases enquiries are made overseas before the .police are asked to try to trace the person.    Many cases are cleared upby these departmental enquiries without the police having to be troubled.(6)    &quot;A requirement should be placed on relatives in this country to act asguarantors for persons coming for a restricted stay at their invitation, providedthat an effective system of sanctions can be devised to prevent abuse&quot; (paragraph.2U9).Comment - The Government hove carefully considered the suggestion that relativesshould be required to act as guarantors for people coming at their invitation fora limited stay in the United Kingdom. But a guarantee of this kind would be likelyto be of little value;   experience has shown that a relative cannot ensurethat he is kept informed of the movements of a person he is sponsoring.   Such anundertaking, even when entered into in good faith, would be most difficult, ifnot impossible, for the sponsor to honour and for the Home Office to enforce-INnUhNTlAL
(7) &quot;   &quot;The Home Office, the Department of Health and Social Security and theDepartment of Employment -after consulting local authority and voluntary-associations, should jointly sponsor a special inquiry in London andthe provinces by a social unit to measure the size of the problem of homelessblack youths and to recommend ways of dealing with it&quot; (paragraph 2  3)Comment - On 22 November 1972 the Home Secretary asked the Community relations commission to enquire into the incidence, causes and consequences of both adolescents-cent unemployment and adolescent homelessness among ethnic minorities in thiscountry and to report on the policy implications of their findings.This request was made under- Section 25X3) (h) of the Race Relations Act 1?68;which provides for the Commission to advise the Secretary of State on any matterreferred by him to the Commission.
(8)     &quot;Section 6 of the Race Relations Act 1965 should either be repealedor occasionally brought to bear against publications and speeches manifestlyseeking to stir up racial hatred&quot; (paragraph 2$9),Comment - The Government are aware that the provisions of section 6 of the race relations Act 1965 have been criticised partly on the grounds that these provisions are not appropriate to the rest of the Act.   It can, however,be argued that the provisions are in themselves unobjectionable?   they in no    -way inhibit private discussion, nor do they inhibit reasonable public discussion;   what they do is to forbid public abuse motivated by actual intent to stir up hatred and likely to stir up hatred against any section of thepublic distinguished by colour, race or ethnic or national origins.Prosecutions under the sectionjnay be insjy.toted.J;nEQgland and Wales only by orxd.th the consent of the Attorney General.   There have been prosecutions in only7 cases, involving a total of fifteen people, since, the Act came into force.The small number of prosecutions may indicate that the section has a deterrenteffects   the Attorney General would not hesitate to prosecute or give his consent to a prosecution if he believed that it would be in the public interestto do so.On balance, the Government doubt whether anything would be gained by repealingthe section at the present time, and whatever deterrent effect it has would be lost.
(Q) &quot;Community and youth leaders should do more to counter distortion andexaggeration&quot;   (paragraph 261).Comment -   The Government share the Committee1s views on the importance ofa constructive examination of the social issues created by immigration,&quot;which can do much to counter the misconceptions which abound in this field.The Community Relations Commission will therefore continue to encourage.,community relations councils to provide objective information to all sectionsof the public on the facts of a multi-racial society and their implications.In addition, the Commission advocates and assists with instruction aboutminority groups as part of the training of various types of social workers.(10)   &quot;Police and immigrant organisations should seek to encourage community,. &apos; - Is&apos;,. -      :-&apos;v . -.    :   &apos;&apos;iX--&apos; &apos; v:liaison&quot; (paragraph 271).Comment -   The police and particularly the police community liaison officersseek informal contacts, since they recognise that this is the best way toincrease mutual understanding.   The Government fully accept the great valueof the work which the police and immigrant organisations do in this field, andwill continue to do everything possible to encourage it.
(ll)       &quot;Chief officers of police should realise the importance of appointingthe right person to be a community liaison officer andthen of making sure that the post is , not allowed to become a dead end.    Women have a specialcontribution to make in such appointments&quot; (paragraph 274).(12)       &quot;All senior police community liaison officers should have access to senior officers, including chief officers of police, when they want it&quot;0(paragraph 275).(13)       &quot;Chief Officers of police should consider to what extent they should appoint assistant community liaison officers of junior rank, including women,perhaps part-time, at subdivisions and stations&quot; (paragraph 276)*Comment - The Government agree with these recommendations, which reflectgeneral police attitudes and practice, and will bring them to the attentionof chief officers of police, so that existing liaison arrangements can be reviewed in the light of the Select Committee&apos;s comments.The police already pay a good deal of attention to the role of theconununity liaison officer.   As the Select Committee have recognised, forexample in their recommendations on police training, good relations betweenthe police.and the community depend not only on the specialist communityliaison officers but also on the day to day contacts between the generality of police officers end member? of the public*. The home beat police officer(the &quot;neighbourhood policeman&quot;), who is well placed to build up confidencebetween the police and the people who live in his area, may also have aspecial part to play.
: It is essential that the community liaison officers should be of thepersonality and standing to ensure that the contacts are fruitful.&apos;It isthe general practice for community liaison officers to have access to senior officers, including chief officers of police, and the contributionthat women police officers can make in this field is recognised.   Appointraenof assistant and part time community liaison officers have been made wherecircumstances warrant them..................... &apos;9(14)       &quot;Regular meetings of community liaison officers should be held,regionally and nationally&quot; (paragraph 277)*Comment -  The Government agree that further opportunities for communityliaison officers to exchange views and experiences would be fruitful.The Home Office are. in touch with the Association of Chief Police officers with a view to implementing this recommendation.
(15)The Community Relations Commission should review the establishmentof community relations councils in relation to operational areas is(paragraph 28$) aComment -   Community relations councils in the larger cities have, for themoat part, already appointed teams of community relations workers.    In other places community relations councils have appointed specialist community relations officers, for example for employment, housing or education.   TheCommunity Relations Commission, is continuing to keep under review ways ofmaintaining and improving contact-with-local commuiiitie-sT^and is particularlyaware of the need for closer contact with communities within conurbations.The Commission, however, has always been conscious of the need to involvelocal authorities in its work and hence community relations councils havebeen established on a basis of local authority area and this will remain thegeneral pattern.(16)      &quot;the Home Office and the Department of Education and Science should hold discussions between themselves, and with appropriate bodies, includingthe police, with a view to encouraging and expanding police work in schools and among teachers in training&quot; (paragraph 286).Comment --   The Government accept this recommendation and will continue to stimulate local initiative in this field.
(17)       &quot;The Home Office should implement the views and recommendations ofthe Working Party on Police Training in Race Relations in local training&apos;and see that they are put into effect&quot; (paragraph 293).Comment -   The implementation in local training of the recommendations ofmatter for each chief officer of police.    Copies of the report have beensent to them by the Home Office with a letter endorsing the recommendations.A Working Party on Police Probationer Training took these recommendationsinto account in framing its proposals for training probationers both in home Office training centres and-in-forces.-The-Home-Office are taking steps to see that these proposals, which have been agreed by the PoliceTraining Council, are implemented according to the n eeds of the individualforce.(18)       &quot;Wot only should police officers be encouraged to apply for awardsfor visits to immigrants&apos; countries of origin but statutory bodies should provide for this where the funds available from voluntary bodies are insufficient&quot; (paragraph 294) *(19)       &quot;There should be exchanges for longer periods of police officersof lower ranks with those of appropriate countries&quot; (paragraph 294).Comment -    Visits and exchanges between police officers of different countries have certainly proved to be valuable, and police officers willcontinue to be encouraged to apply for awards for visits to immigrants&apos;countries of origin.     Inevitably only a minority of officers canparticipate in such    scheme^but if necessary assistance from public funds will certainly be considered.the Report of the Working Party Si Police Training in Race Relations is a
(20)     SIA booklet should be issued to all police officers about thebackgrounds of immigrant communities, the reasons why they came to thiscountry, their cultures, z*e!igions and attitudes and an outline of the immigration laws&quot; (paragraph 295)&apos;Comment -   The Government agree that information on these matters shouldcontinue to be given to all police officers as part of their training,but doubt whether it could usefully be summarised in a centrally producedbooklet for practical use by all police officers.   Some forces have,alreadyproduced booklets, which have proved valuable, for local use.   Therecommendation of the Working Party on Police Training in Race Relationsthat more written material should be made available to police students and that every force should have a selection of suitable books easilyavailable for study and reference was commended to chief officers of police.(21)   &quot;There should be. a greatly increased use of visual aids&quot;(paragraph 295)Comment -   Visual aids of many kinds are already widely used in policetraining, and this recommendation will bs brought to the attention of chief officers of police.
(22)       &quot;Training in race relations should be kept up to date for allpolicemen at all stages in their careers, not simply for the currentintake of recruits&quot; (pai^a graph 296) .Comment -  The Working Party on police Training in Race Relations made some detailed recommendations on the training of officers throughout their careers, and these recommendations have been brought; to the noticeof chief officers, of police. Abtention ra.ll be drawn to themagain in the light of this recommendation.     They will also be takeninto account in a general review of sergeants&apos; training which is shortly to be undertaken and, to the extent that this is not done already, in planning future courses at the Police College for more senior officers.(23)     &quot;Experiments with more flexible types of training should be continued and extended (paragraph 296) .Comment - Within the limits of manpower and resources available to each force,experiments in this field are desirable, and the Home Office will draw thisrecommendation to the attention of chief officers of police.
(2k)   &quot;The Home Office should study again the recruitment of coloured police officers to see what encouragement could be given&quot; (paragraph 306).Comment - The Government readily accept the recommendation that the Home office should study again the recruitment of coloured police officers.   The studywill take into account the evidence given to the Committee and the effects of applying other relevant recommendations as they, become, apparent.At. the end of August 1973 there were 65 coloured police officers servingwhen the figures given in the report were prepared.   The Government welcomethis small, though marked, increase and Xirould welcome larger increases infuture years.The Department of Employment arranges pre-training courses in english and arithmetic for people intending to undergo subsequent training for thepublic service, including the police.   These courses are of particular benefitto immigrants.(25) &quot;Any recruiting campaign for special constables should include an appealto coloured people&quot; (paragraph 307)*Comment - The recruitment of special constables is the responsibility of chief officers of police and has always been a local matter.   A Home Officecircular which was issued on 28 November 1972 quoted paragraph 307 and recommendation 25 of the Report and asked police authorities and. chief constables to bear the recommendation in mind.   Some posters and recruitingleaflets relating to the Special Constabulary are supplied by the Home Officeand new ones were produced during 1972.   When fresh designs are.required, theHome Office will have regard to this recommendation.forces in England and Wales, an increase of
1! El D  SWT! IV(26)     &quot;Police forces outside London should pay attention to the benefits of recruiting coloured traffic wardens and the Home Office should take them into account in their study&quot; (paragraph 308).Comment - Recruitment of traffic wardens outside the Metropolitan police district is a matter for police authorities,-and the.Committee&apos;s view willbe conveyed to them.   The considerations and problems involved in the recruitment of traffic wardens differ in many respects from those arising on police recruitment and it is doubtful whether recruitment of traffic wardenscm usefully be included in the study suggested by recommendation 2iu   If showever, any matters relevant to traffic wardens arise in the course of the study, they will be passed on to those concerned with recruitment,,(27)   &quot;All police forces in which it is appropriate should consider theaward of special allowances to those becoming proficient in Asian Languages&quot;(paragraph 312).Comment   -   The Police Council for the United Kingdom, whose responsibilitythis is in the first instance, have been asked for their views.(28)   &quot;All police forces whose members are likely to have contact with Asiansshould make provision for all their officers to learn a few simple words ofHindi/Urdu&quot; (paragraph 312).Comment   -   The Government will bring this recommendation to the attentionof chief officers of police, and will be ready to give chief officers any assistance they may require.   Some police officers do in fact already studyimmigrant languages.
(29)     nAll police forces should geek the co-operation of community relationscouncils and/or immigrant organisations in drawing up lists of officialinterpreters&quot;   (paragraph 313)oComment -    The Government have no evidence that the police experiencedifficulty in obtaining interpreters, but the recommendation will be broughtto the attention of chief officers of police.(30)      &quot;All police forces should immediately make widely availableclear, concise pamphlets in English and Asian languages about the poliosrole and functions&quot; (paragraph 314) .Comment -   The Select Committee refer in paragraph 314 to the draftpamphlet issued by the Home Office in 1971o    Some forces have issuedsuch pamphlets, and the Government will invite all chief officers ofpolice to consider doing so.(33.)     &quot;Information about malting complaints against the police and the rightsof citizens on arrest or at a police station should be available in all appropriate languages&quot; (paragraph 315)oComment -   The Government will make leaflets on these subjects available tochief officers of police in appropriate languages.
*Ul\lrIUhNleAlL -(32)   &quot;The police should do more to make known the work they do to improvecommunity relations&quot; (paragraph 318) .Comment -   The Government agree that it is desirable that the effort thepolice devote to community relations should be widely known and will drawthis recommendation to the attention of chief officers of police.(33)       &quot;Lists of names of persons who could be contacted on arrest shouldbe drawn up in consultation with community relations councils and madeavailable on request at police stations.,   But it should be made clear that provision of the list does not automatically confer on an arrested personthe right to telephone anyone on it&quot; (paragraph 322).Comment -    This recommendation will be drawn to the attention of chief-:   &quot;!&apos;V&quot; Iofficers of police.     The Government agree with the Select Committee^comment (paragraph 225) that an individual should not, by virtue.only ofbeing on such a list, be entitled to be present when a person is chargedor questioned at a police station.(3k)   &quot;The Home Office should issue fresh guidance on the best way of givinginformation about the rights of individuals in their dealings with the police&quot;(paragraph 32h)- -Comment -   The Judges&apos; Rules and Administrative Directions to the Police(published by H.M. Stationery Office, 196h, price 10p) not only require that persons in custody should be informed orally of the rights and facilities available to them but also that notices describing them should be displayedat convenient and conspicuous places at police stations and that the attentionof persons in custody should be drawn to these notices.   Attention is drawn to these requirements in the draft pamphlet sent to chief officers of policeby the Home Office and referred to in the comment on recommendation 30 above.Subject to what is said in the comment on recommendation 31, the Governmentdoubt whether any fresh guidance to police forces is necessary.CONFIDENTIAL-
(35)      &quot;The Home Secretary 3hould take urgent steps to introduce a layelement into inquiries into complaints against the police, possibly by setting up independent tribunals to consider appeals by complainants orpolice officers dissatisfied with police inquiries into complaints(paragraph 333).d&apos;   IIComment -   Consultations are in progress with the police representative bodies about the possible introduction of an independent element into thearrangements for dealing wi.th complaints against the police,,(36)     &quot;All police forces should adopt the practice of sending, where appropriate, a senior officer to discuss with a complainant the result ofhis complaint (paragraph 334)eComment -   It has already been suggested to chief officers of police in aHome Office circular that in appropriate cases a senior police officer might-see the complainant and explain why the officer complained of took a certaincourse of action, what was his duty, what were his police powers and what werethe circumstances in which he acted.
