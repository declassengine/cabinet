Reform of the Law on Consumer CreditPART one a new approach1. The demand for consumer credit has grown rapidly over the last 25years. To meet it old credit systems have expanded and taken on newforms, and entirely new systems have been developed. Without the use of credit the standard of living of many, particularly those in the process of setting up home and starting a family, would be lower. The transformationwhich has taken place in the credit industry has been no less radical thanthat which the retail trades have undergone. Legislation in the creditfield, which in the past has been piecemeal and directed at particularforms of credit arrangement or types of lender as difficulties have appeared,has not kept pace with these changes.2. The Pawnbrokers Acts lay down detailed requirements covering the licensing of pawnbrokers, the records they should maintain, the chargesthey may make and the redemption and sale of pledges. The MoneylendersActs subject moneylenders, except banks and certain others, to a licensing system and place restrictions on their advertisements and on the generalconduct of their business, control the provisions which may be put in their contracts and give the Courts power to reopen agreements in certaincircumstances. The Bills of Sale Acts place severe restrictions on the taking of chattel mortgages and effectively discourage their use. the hire-Purchase Acts provide the consumer with a wide range of protection in hire-purchase, conditional sale and credit-sale agreements and the Advertise-ments (Hire-Purchase) Act controls certain advertisements. As far as theloan element itself is concerned, these statutes as a whole do not providethe consumer with adequate protection. They place many restrictions on some types of credit business but none on others and, while impeding thedevelopment of some kinds of business, they have tended to hasten growth in other types outside their scope.Crowther Committee3. In 1968 the previous Government set up a Committee, of which thelate Lord Crowther was Chairman, to review existing law and practicegoverning the provision of consumer credit and to make recommendations.Its report Consumer Credit was published in 1971.* We are all indebted to members of the Committee for their painstaking study and well-conceivedrecommendations.4. The Committee saw no logic in the existing legal framework underwhich the degree of protection for the consumer and his prospects ofremedy against failings or abuses on the part of the supplier of credit* Cmnd. 4596.
varied according to the legal form of the transaction rather than its under-lying nature. Likewise they could see no justification for the differences inthe legal restrictions imposed on different types of lender, which resulted indetailed control of some and no control of others. The committee considered that the existing framework was quite unsuited to present and prospective needs and recommended radical reform to establish a singleset of rights and obligations covering all types of consumer credit trans-action with such additional provisions for certain transactions as seemedappropriate to their nature. They also recommended uniform regulation,including institution of a licensing arrangement, to cover all types of creditgrantor, and the removal of existing impediments to competition betweenthem.A Consumer Credit Bill5. The Government have accepted this general approach of theCommittee and they intend to introduce a consumer credit Bill, applying to the whole of the United Kingdom, to implement its recommendations for consumer protection and uniform regulation of the industry. Thetwin purposes of the proposals which will be placed before Parliament inthe Bill will be first, to release the credit industry from existing outdatedrestrictions and to allow it to develop in future within a framework whichwill encourage competition between different types of activity and thedevelopment of new forms of business; and second, to provide consistentand adequate protection for the consumer across the whole spectrum of credit transactions. It will give many lenders much greater freedom thanin the past while imposing that degree of control which is necessary in a modern economy, as experience in the United States and other countries with a developed consumer credit industry has shown. It will build onthe foundation laid by the hire-purchase legislation from 1938 onwardsby strengthening the protection given to the consumer and extending thatprotection to a far wider range of transactions.6. The Bill will apply to all loans, whether or not linked to thepurchase of goods or services. It will also cover hire-purchase transactions and give protection to those who enter into longer-term hiring (rental andleasing) agreements. It will apply generally to transactions of up to  5,000whether with individuals or with non-corporate bodies. In order not toinhibit small transactions unreasonably, some of the detailed provisionswill not apply when  30 or less is involved. The major improvements inprotection for the consumer in the Bill represent a further importantadvance in the Governments general programme of providing fair and effective protection of the consumer in his day-to-day commercial transactions.7. The second part of this White Paper sets out the contents of theproposed Bill in non-legal language. In short, it will:(i) Repeal the Moneylenders, Pawnbrokers, Hire-Purchase andAdvertisements (Hire-Purchase) Acts, as well as modify in come degree a number of other Acts;*(ii) Establish a Consumer Credit Commissioner as an independentauthority with responsibility for administering a licensing system;* Wherever reference is made in the text to existing legislation it should be takento include reference to the corresponding legislation in Scotland and Northern Ireland.
keeping developments in the credit field under review; advising the Government on the operation of the statute and of orders made under it and on the need for any amendment; and helping to educate the public in the proper use of credit;(iii) Extend the existing protection of the Hire-Purchase Acts to all forms of consumer credit, strengthen the existing provisions incertain directions and add important new ones;(iv) Provide &apos; truth in lending&apos; by preventing false or misleadingadvertisements and by requiring in advertisements and agreementsfull disclosure of the terms offered, including the full cost of credit in both cash and percentage per annum terms;(v) Provide suitable protection for consumers hiring (renting andleasing) goods as an alternative to buying them; and(vi) Subject all offering consumer loan, hire-purchase or hiringagreements, either as principals or as intermediaries, and those engaged in ancillary trades, to control by licensing.8. The Bill will give effect to all the major recommendations of theCrowther Committee in the consumer credit field proper, with the followingexceptions:(a) It is not proposed to provide for the more easy taking of chattelmortgages (that is, the taking of security on the personal propertyof the individual as a condition of granting a loan).* The government accept that there is a case for reform of the law in this field,but they are not convinced that the possible benefits of theCommittee&apos;s recommendations to the credit industry and to someconsumers would outweigh the possible social disadvantages for others. They will be prepared to reconsider this issue in the lightof conditions prevailing after the presently proposed Bill is in effect and when legislation on lending and security generally is underconsideration (see paragraphs 13 and 14 below);(b) It is proposed to retain in law the concept of hire-purchase and not,as the Committee recommended, to treat a hire-purchase transactionas though it were an immediate sale of goods financed by a securedconnected loan. While the Government accept that in many caseshire-purchase is, as the Committee concluded, little more than a legalfiction, there are many transactions, particularly in the business field,where the intention is that there should be a hiring agreement whichmay or may not, at the option of the hirer, end up as an outright sale.Given this and the decision on chattel mortgages set out above,the Government have concluded that there are not sufficient grounds for preventing a hire-purchase transaction from having effect as such;and(c) For goods bought by consumers on credit, protection against theseller contracting out of the conditions and warranties implied bythe Sale of Goods Act 1893 has already been provided in the Supply* In Scotland, of course, there is at present no provision in law for the taking ofchattel mortgages.-i : *^3-     t   -143022 c*
of Goods (Implied Terms) Act 1973. The Bill will not provide protection against any similar contracting out by sellers of services.Legislation on this must await the recommendations of the LawCommissions who are currently studying the issues arising for services generally whether sold for cash or on credit.9. There are two important respects in which the Bill will provide protection for consumers in addition to that recommended by the CrowtherCommittee:(d) There is much evidence of undue pressure being exerted on individualsto grant a mortgage, usually a second mortgage, on their homes asa condition of a personal loan without having time to reflect on theserious problems which may arise if, for example, the borrower wants to move house before the loan has been repaid. The CrowtherCommittee only recommended a cooling-off period (during which theconsumer could withdraw without penalty) for these, and other,transactions negotiated away from trade premises, for example ondoorsteps. The Bill will extend this cooling-off period to transactionsinvolving such mortgages wherever negotiated.(b) Those hiring goods will have some additional protection, including a right to terminate their agreements after an initial period of notmore than 18 months.10. The Government want this new legislation to be flexible so thatit will remain fully operative right across the credit industry even if newforms of credit transaction are invented. To achieve this, provision will bemade for much of the detail to be prescribed by Order made under thestatute; the Orders will, of course, be subject to the normal procedures for parliamentary scrutiny. Similarly, the Fair Trading Act is a flexibleinstrument across the whole range of commercial activities affecting theconsumer and the Director General of Fair Trading has powers to intervene in practices both in the field of cash and of credit sales whichadversely affect consumers&apos; interests.11. One of the results of the Moneylenders Acts, which was not foreseenat the time, has been some inhibition of the development of new sources of finance for industry. The repeal of the Moneylenders Acts will mean that loans between moneylenders and corporate bodies will no longer besubject to any special restrictions, nor will anyone wishing to lend to acorporate body in future be subject to regulation.12. Under Section 123 of the Companies Act 1967 the Secretary of Statefor Trade and Industry can certify that a person (including a company) can properly be treated for the purposes of the Moneylenders Acts 1900 to 1927as being bona fide carrying on the business of banking. Such a certificateaffords effective exemption from the requirements of the Moneylenders Acts.With their repeal this provision will no longer be needed and it too will be repealed.Lending and security generally13. The Crowther Committee concluded that they could not dealadequately with consumer credit problems without considering the widerissues of lending and security generally which are relevant across the wbr&apos;
field of commercial transactions. Accordingly they devoted a considerable part of their report to proposals for a new framework for the taking of security in all types of loan transaction; its main impact would be on purelybusiness transactions, but it would also affect consumer loans where securitywas taken. The Committee&apos;s recommendation for the more easy taking of chattel mortgages, together with the removal of present anomalies inthe law governing them, was conceived as part of this new framework.14. The Committee&apos;s proposals are for radical reform in a complexfield and their implementation would require another major Bill, centralto which would be the establishment of a Register of Security Interests and detailed priority provisions depending upon its existence and use. TheGovernment accept that there are aspects of the existing law in this field which cause difficulty, but they do not have sufficient evidence either of a need for such major recasting of existing law on new principles or of general support for the particular solution proposed by the Committee. they intend to institute consultations with those most! closely concerned in thelight of the situation existing after passage of the Consumer Credit Bill.
PART TWOContents of the proposed Consumer Credit BillConsumer Credit Commissioner15. The Crowther Committee recommended that there should be anindependent Consumer Credit Commissioner who should be responsiblefor administering and enforcing the new legislation and for general oversightof the consumer credit industry. The Government have generally acceptedthe Committee&apos;s recommendation. The Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry will be the Minister generally responsible for consumer creditmatters, and the Bill will provide for him to appoint a Consumer CreditCommissioner.16.   The Commissioners main functions will be:(i) To keep under review developments in the consumer credit field and the practical working of the statute and Orders made under it, having regard to the interests of the nation as a whole,consumers and the credit industry, and to advise the Secretary ofState on any amending legislation which he considers desirable;(ii) to exercise the powers given to him under the Bill, includingoperation of the licensing arrangements and enforcement of theBill;(iii) to publish such advice and information about consumer creditas may appear to him to be desirable; and(iv) to seek to educate the public in the uses of credit.In order to provide uniform safeguards for all consumers in the credit fieldit is proposed, as already indicated, that the new legislation should extend to the whole of the United Kingdom. Consideration is being given to ways of ensuring that the services of the Commissioner will be readily available tothe people of Northern Ireland.17. The Bill will allow the Secretary of State to give formal directions to the Commissioner on the exercise of his powers and require such directions to be pubbshed. The Commissioner will be obliged to submit an annual report to the Secretary of State which will likewise be published.18. The Commissioners role will be complementary to that of theDirector General of Fair Trading, and the question might be asked why the two offices should not be combined. However, while the director general will cover a very wide field, including consumer protectiongenerally and aspects of competition policy, the Commissioner will haveparticular functions in relation to one industry, i.e. that concerned withconsumer credit, in which field it will be necessary for him to gain specialisedand precise knowledge. He will moreover have a quasi-judicial function in administering the licensing system. Such duties could not readily be merged with those of the Director General. It is, of course5 to be expectedthat the Commissioner and the Director General will work closely together.
19. As already stated, the underlying principle of the Bill will be that its main provisions should apply equally to all forms of credit. The main typescurrent today are, first, loans of money not tied to the purchase of goods and services, which may take such forms as overdrafts, bank advances, loans from moneylenders and loans made with the use of credit cards; second,loans specifically linked to the purchase of goods and services which may involve credit sales, the use of credit cards, trading checks or vouchers, orthe grant of personal loans. Except where it is inappropriate, hire-purchase and conditional sale agreements will be treated in exactly the same way as loan agreements.* The provisions will also, where approp-riate, cover hiring (rental and leasing) agreements. In addition to the main provisions applying to all types of transactions there will be supplementaryrequirements for particular types.20. The Bill will cover transactions in which the borrower or hirer is an individual or non-corporate body. This will mean that its provisions will accordingly benefit many small businesses; the small businessman may beno less in need of protection than the consumer in his credit transactions in particular because of the imbalance of bargaining power which may be most apparent when he is in greatest need of a loan. In covering transactions with non-corporate bodies the Bill will follow the practice adopted in the hire-purchase legislation since 1938 and approved by the CrowtherCommittee.21.  It is proposed to exclude from the general provisions of the Bill:(i) Loans of more than  5,000 (or, if a loan can be drawn by instalments, when more than  5,000 must be drawn at any onetime);(ii) Hire-purchase and conditional sale agreements where the cashprice for the goods, less any down payment, is more than  5,000;(iii) Loans not linked to the purchase of goods or services from aseller having a business connection with the lender where therate of charge for the loan is 10 per cent per annum or less;(iv) Instalment credit transactions linked to the sale of goods or services, including those for trade credit such as monthly accounts,where repayment is expected in less than three instalmentsexcluding any down payment; and(v) Hiring agreements where more than  5,000 must be paid in rentalcharges by the terms of the agreement or where the period of theagreement, including any rights of renewal, cannot exceedthree months.22. The present Hire-Purchase Act covers only transactions of up to 2,000. The higher limit proposed for the Bill takes account of currentprice levels and the increased use of credit for the purchase of more expensive consumer goods.23. Transactions involving  30 or less will be exempt from many of the detailed requirements.   Building societies are covered by the Building* Where loans are mentioned below, this should be read as including hire-purchaseunless the contrary is stated.
Societies Act 1962 and their normal house mortgage business will be exempt from all the provisions of the Bill except those relating to advertising.The hiring of equipment necessarily incidental to the provision of utilityservices, for example gas meters and telephone sets, will also be exempt.Truth in lending24. It is important that credit proposals should not be presented in amisleading manner, and that an individual should have the informationnecessary for deciding rationally between the various choices open to him.The Bill will ensure that the consumer has much more information madeavailable to him than is usual today and in particular that there is fulldisclosure of the cost of borrowing.Advertising25. There will be wide-ranging regulation of all types of advertisingof loan and hiring business, as well as that of debt counsellors and adjustors.This will be contained in Orders made under the statute and details of theproposed regulations are set out in Appendix I.26. In brief, it will be made an offence to issue a false or misleadingadvertisement and there will be power to ban the use of particular wordsor phrases regarded as misleading. There will also be requirements as tothe information that advertisements must contain and the form in which itshould be given. For &apos; unspecific&apos; advertisements, Le. those which simplystate that credit terms are available and do not, for example, include any statement of the cash prices of goods or offer a loan of a specific sum,the main requirement will be that the advertisement must contain an offer to provide details of the credit terms on request without charge. More&apos; specific&apos; advertisements will normally have to state, inter aha, the cashprice of the goods or the amount of the loan, the charge for the credit offered in both money and percentage per annum terms, the number and amount ofinstalments and the total sum payable. Where priced goods are on displayit will not be permissible to state simply &apos; Credit terms available&apos;. It will however be possible for retailers to comply with the requirements by showingprominently a notice saying, for example, that all the goods on display areavailable on credit terms at x per cent deposit and that the balance isrepayable by y monthly instalments at z per cent per annum credit charge.In order to prevent concealment of the cost of credit by offering goods and services on credit terms only and thus showing no cash price, it will be an offence to offer them on credit unless they are also offered as available forcash.27. The advertising provisions will apply not only to transactionscoming generally within the scope of the Bill see paragraphs 19-23 above,but also to advertisements of loans of money where the rate of charge is10 per cent per annum or less and of loans to be secured on the borrowershome,- whatever the size of the loan and whoever the advertiser. Thus,advertisements by building societies will have to comply with the rules eventhough, in other respects, they will be exempt from the legislation.The charge for credit28. The total charge for credit quoted to the individual will have tocover not only the element stated as &apos; interest&apos; on the sum borrowed, but
all other compulsory charges imposed by the lender as a condition of granting the credit. It will include charges for all ancillary services which the lender requires to be taken without allowing the borrower a free choice ofsupplier for them. Thus, in a loan of money the borrower may be chargedsetting up fees, survey fees if a mortgage is sought on his house, compulsorylife insurance through a company chosen by the lender, and so on, inaddition to interest on the sum borrowed. For a loan connected to the saleof goods, there may also be compulsory charges for such things as ancillaryequipment, installation and maintenance which are not compulsory for the cash customer. All such compulsory charges will be treated as part of thecharge for credit (and not as part of the principal advanced). The totalcharge for the credit will have to be disclosed both as a sum of money andas a percentage rate.29. The Government recognise that some compulsory charges imposed by lenders may be for things which are of value to the customer and that,to this extent, it could be argued that they should be excluded from anycalculation of the charge for credit. However, to do so would open upopportunities for masking the cost of credit which the unscrupulous would readily use; thus, an inflated charge could be made for a particularcompulsory ancillary service and a correspondingly lower charge for creditbe advertised. A lender will of course be permitted to exclude from thecharge for credit the cost of any item which is not compulsory but whichthe consumer asks him to provide. He will also be permitted to exclude from it the cost of any item for which he allows the consumer free choice of supplier.30. It is intended to give effect to these proposals in Orders made underthe statute, and further details, including formulae for calculating the rateof charge, are included in Appendix I.Quotations for loans31. It is often helpful to have the salient figures of an offer in writing.Consumers will be entitled upon request to a written quotation of the terms offered. It will be an offence to fail to provide such a quotation complying with the statutory requirements but, of course, this requirement will not applyif it is not intended for any reason to do business with the enquirer.Disclosure at the negotiation stage32. Potential borrowers will have to be provided with certain information,for example the cash price where the sale of goods or services is involved,before they enter into agreements. If this has not already been provided byquotation or, for example, by a label attached to goods on display, it willhave to be given in writing separately from the agreement.Protection before an agreement is madePersonal canvassing33. Door-to-door canvassing is a sales technique which may be usedto exert undue pressure on customers, but much reputable trade is conducted by this means. The doorstep canvassing of loans of money will be banned,but not the promotion of the sale of goods and services on credit terms,including, for example, check trade business.   However, to control any
all other compulsory charges imposed by the lender as a condition of granting the credit. It will include charges for all ancillary services which the lender requires to be taken without allowing the borrower a free choice ofsupplier for them. Thus, in a loan of money the borrower may be chargedsetting up fees, survey fees if a mortgage is sought on his house, compulsorylife insurance through a company chosen by the lender, and so on, inaddition to interest on the sum borrowed. For a loan connected to the saleof goods, there may also be compulsory charges for such things as ancillaryequipment, installation and maintenance which are not compulsory for the cash customer. All such compulsory charges will be treated as part of thecharge for credit (and not as part of the principal advanced). The totalcharge for the credit will have to be disclosed both as a sum of money andas a percentage rate.29. The Government recognise that some compulsory charges imposed by lenders may be for things which are of value to the customer and that,to this extent, it could be argued that they should be excluded from anycalculation of the charge for credit. However, to do so would open upopportunities for masking the cost of credit which the unscrupulous would readily use; thus, an inflated charge could be made for a particularcompulsory ancillary service and a correspondingly lower charge for creditbe advertised. A lender will of course be permitted to exclude from thecharge for credit the cost of any item which is not compulsory but whichthe consumer asks him to provide. He will also be permitted to exclude from it the cost of any item for which he allows the consumer free choice of supplier.30. It is intended to give effect to these proposals in Orders made underthe statute, and further details, including formulae for calculating the rateof charge, are included in Appendix I.Quotations for loans31. It is often helpful to have the salient figures of an offer in writing.Consumers will be entitled upon request to a written quotation of the terms offered. It will be an offence to fail to provide such a quotation complying with the statutory requirements but, of course, this requirement will not applyif it is not intended for any reason to do business with the enquirer.Disclosure at the negotiation stage32. Potential borrowers will have to be provided with certain information,for example the cash price where the sale of goods or services is involved,before they enter into agreements. If this has not already been provided byquotation or, for example, by a label attached to goods on display, it willhave to be given in writing separately from the agreement.Protection before an agreement is madePersonal canvassing33. Door-to-door canvassing is a sales technique which may be usedto exert undue pressure on customers, but much reputable trade is conducted by this means. The doorstep canvassing of loans of money will be banned,but not the promotion of the sale of goods and services on credit terms,including, for example, check trade business.   However, to control any
abuse it is proposed to require all those engaged in such canvassing tohold special licences. These will not be available to independent salesmenwho are not themselves, or who do not represent, either providers of the credit or sellers of the goods or services involved.Mass mailing of credit cards and other credit instruments34. There have been recent examples of the mass mailing of unsolicitedcredit cards and of other credit vouchers which, after no more formalitythan signature by the recipient, can be used to obtain goods, services orcash on credit. This can lead to fraud if they fall into the wrong hands.Moreover, there is much evidence that many people are offended, or evenfrightened, by receiving them in this way. It is noteworthy that such massmailing is now prohibited in the United States.35. The Government have decided that the issue of a credit card orother credit instrument should not be permitted except in response to a specific application personally signed by the proposed recipient (whether thecard is for his own use or that of someone else authorised by him). Theprohibition will not apply where the credit outstanding cannot exceed  30at any one time or to the issue of replacement cards or other instrumentsunder continuing agreements.Cooling off periods36. The pre-contract protection set out above will normally end whenall parties have signed an agreement and are then bound by it. There are,however, circumstances in which an opportunity for second thoughts seemsnecessary. To curb abuses by some door-to-door salesmen the Hire-PurchaseAct 1965 already provides for cancellation without penalty within a limited period of some agreements signed away from trade premises. This coolingoff period will be extended to all other types of consumer loan and hiringagreement, but with three important provisos.37. First, since the intention is to protect the consumer from the highpressure salesman, there will be no cancellation rights where there has been no personal contact between consumer and lender or salesman, for example insome mail order business where the transaction has been conducted by postalcommunication only.38. Second, there will be no cancellation right for agreements for  30or less unless they are linked to the purchase of goods or services and aresecured, as for example, in hire-purchase transactions.39. Third, as already mentioned in paragraph 9 (a) above, the cooling offperiod will apply in all transactions, wherever negotiated, involving loanssecured on a person&apos;s own home, except when the loan is made specificallyin connection with the purchase of that home.40. In transactions not involving mortgages, the borrower will have atleast four days in which to think again, and the agreements involved willhave to contain a detachable cancellation slip which the borrower need only sign and return to the lender or his agent. (A separate letter of cancellation signed by the borrower will, of course, be equally effective.)41. A simple right of cancellation of mortgage agreements alreadysigned would introduce peculiar complications which would arise if the mortgage were registered before cancellation took place.   In view of this,
there will be a special procedure designed to give a cooling off period before a mortgage (other than one arising from the purchase of a house) can be created. A prospective borrower will have to be supplied initially witha copy of the proposed agreement and any separate mortgage documents,including a detachable rejection form. After at least seven days duringwhich no approach should be made to the prospective borrower, and provided that no rejection notice has been sent, the agreement itself with another detachable rejection form may be sent to the prospective borrowerfor signature. Again no further approach will be permitted for at leastseven more days and then only if the prospective borrower has not rejected the proposal.42. Where an agreement is cancelled (or a mortgage agreement is notsigned), any linked agreement for insurance, maintenance or ancillaryequipment or other goods (for example food for a deep-freezer) will auto-matically lapse, even though it is with someone not party to the mainagreement. The borrower will be entitled to recover any payment he hasmade, any article given in part exchange or in pledge, or other securitytaken by the lender. He will have to return any goods supplied and to repay any sum advanced to him by the lender.43. If it is a money loan transaction, he may choose to repay by thefirst instalment date the whole or part only of any advance made priorto cancellation. Any money not then repaid will be payable pro rata inaccordance with the terms of the agreement. No charges will be payable on any principal repaid by the first instalment date and, where part of an advance only is left outstanding to be repaid by instalments, the borrowerwill have to pay only interest proportionate to that part.44. There will be one general exception to these cancellation provisions.Suppliers will obviously be chary of providing goods or services whilecancellation is possible and a consumer might therefore find it difficult toget emergency work carried out. A borrower will therefore have to pay areasonable price for any work done and materials supplied in an emergencyunder a credit arrangement concluded away from trade premises.Telephone canvassing45. The canvassing of credit business by telephone is becoming morecommon and is causing some annoyance and disquiet. It is a method used by many reputable firms, but it is also used by others as a means of exertingpressure on consumers to accept credit which they do not want or on terms that are unfavourable. The Government are considering whether to banall unsolicited telephone canvassing of consumer credit or hiring business and will take into account any further views which may be put to them.The agreement itself46. The Bill will contain provisions designed to ensure that, so far asis reasonable, the consumer is made aware of his commitments whensigning an agreement. It will also require agreements to contain certain provisions, will prohibit the inclusion of others which are regarded as harshor unreasonable and will render void any provisions purporting to excludeor diminish the borrower^ statutory rights or impose upon him liabilitiesgreater than those permitted by the statute.15
47. There will be power to prescribe in detail by Order the form and content of agreements. This power will cover such matters as requiredinformation, required warnings or statements of rights and their locationin a prominent position, and size and colour of the print. Details of theproposed regulations are set out in Appendix II. In considering whether anagreement conforms to the statutory requirements, and thus is enforceableagainst the borrower, the Court will be able to consider how it was presented.Thus, if it had been stapled together in such a way as to hide information from the consumer, the Court could hold that it did not conform to therequirements. The information to be included will naturally vary accordingto the type of agreement, but the intention is to apply requirementssimilar to those under existing hire-purchase legislation. For example,loan agreements will have to show clearly the nature of the agreement, theamount borrowed, the rate of charge, the amount and number of instalmentspayable and the total money sum payable. In addition, borrowers andhirers will have to be supplied with copies of agreements which they have signed. In principle, infringement of these requirements will render anagreement unenforceable against the borrower or hirer although it will remainenforceable against the lender or supplier. In considering enforceability theCourt will have to take into account the harm caused to the consumer andthe blame attaching to the lender or supplier. However, the Court will haveno discretion where there has been failure to include a statement of the consumers right to cancel an agreement.Protection while agreements are operativeRebates for early settlement48. An individual may wish to pay off the outstanding balance undera loan agreement ahead of time because, for example, his personal financial situation has improved, he wishes to trade-in goods covered by an existing agreement or he wishes to move from a house which has been given as security for the loan. The Government believe it is important that borrowersshould be able to settle early, and the Bill will make void any clause in anagreement denying the borrower a right to settle ahead of time or imposingany special charge or penalty for doing so.49. The borrower should have to give proper notice of his intention tosettle ahead of time, but the period of notice should not be so long as todetract from the right of early settlement. A period of notice of threemonths, or one instalment period if this is less than three months, will therefore suffice whatever the agreement may say.50. A right of early settlement would be of little value if the borrower had to pay in full all the charges for which he would be liable ifthe agreement ran for its full term. At present some lenders allow no rebateof charges, while there is considerable variation in the calculation ofrebates by those who do allow them. The Bill will require that, where aborrower settles ahead of time or a lender calls in the balance of a loanearly under the terms of the agreement, the lender must as a minimum allow the borrower a statutory rebate in the charge made. Rules for calculating the minimum rebate will be made by Order and they are described inAppendix III.  Basically it will be calculated by the formula known as the
Rule of 78* which is commonly used in commerce today. However, sincethe rebate will be calculated on the total charge made for credit (and notonly on the interest element) and since the lender often incurs in fullsubstantial expenses at the start of the contract 5 the calculation will be madeas though repayment were postponed three months beyond the date actuallyarranged. In cases where a debt is repaid early as part of a re-financingarrangement with the same lender the Rule of 78 will apply without this modification.51. While rebates generally will have to be based on the total charge for credit as defined for disclosure purposes, it will be permitted to deductfrom the total charge any element payable as a registration fee to the LandRegistry for a mortgage of land.52. A borrower contemplating earlier settlement may wish to know theamount of the rebate to which he would be entitled and he will have the rightto be told this on request.53. As a condition of obtaining a loan a borrower may have to enterinto other transactions, for such purposes as life insurance or the main-tenance of a television set. The Bill will provide for termination of such agreements without extra penalty when the main agreement is terminatedearly.Right of hirer to terminate a hiring agreement54. While a supplier ought to have reasonable assurance as to the return on his outlay, some hiring (rental and leasing) agreements are binding onthe hirer, but not on the supplier, for an unduly long time. The Bill willgive to hirers a statutory right to terminate agreements not less than18 months from their starting date. The period of notice required will bethe same as the interval between rental payments set in the agreement, but with a maximum of three months.55. Oh termination, the hirer will be liable to pay damages for any failure to take reasonable care of the goods, as well as having to payrentals and other charges which have accrued up to the date of termination.He will however have no further hability. If he has paid any charges for periods after the date of termination, he will be entitled to have them back.Appropriation of payments56. Where a consumer has more than one agreement (whether loan,hire-purchase or rental or a combination of types) with one lender orowner and he pays less than the full instalments due, he will be entitled tosay how much of the amount he is paying should be set against eachagreement. If he does not state how the payment is to be appropriated,the lender or supplier must set it pro rata against the amount due under each agreement. Without such provision the owner could appropriate a payment in such a way as to serve his interest best and that of the consumerworst.* Under the Rule of 78 the final payment is such that the borrower pays the sameeffective annual rate of charge as he would have done had he continued to pay theinstalments as originally arranged.17

57. Agreements invariably include terms giving the lender or suppliercertain rights in the event of default on the part of the borrower or hirer.These rights may entitle him to repossess goods, seize a security or pledge,or require immediate or accelerated payment of a loan. The Bill will not allow enforcement of such rights until the borrower or hirer has been servedwith a notice of default and allowed time to make good his default. Therewill, however, be power to exempt by Order classes of loan from this rule,and this power will be used to exempt loans of up to  15 secured on a pledge. To ensure that the borrower or hirer clearly understands hisposition, each notice of default will have to contain a statement of the amountdue but unpaid (or other alleged breach of the terms of the agreement) and require payment (or rectification) within a specified period of not less than seven days. The notice will have to explain the consequences of failure to remedy the fault and explain the courses of action open to the borrower orhirer.Repossession of goods: acceleration of payment58. If a borrower or hirer rectifies a default within the period specifiedin a notice of default, the consequences of default will not follow. if however he remains in default, the Bill will still limit the lendefs orsuppliers ability to enforce his contractual rights.59. The position of a consumer under a hire-purchase (or conditionalsale) agreement in relation to repossession of the goods will continue exactlyas laid down in existing hire-purchase legislation. Thus, if less than one-thirdof the price has been paid the owner (lender) will be able to repossess thegoods; if one-third or more of the price has been paid the goods will be&apos; protected goods&apos; and the owner&apos;s right to repossession will be enforceableonly with a Court order; the Court may give the consumer additional timeto pay for the goods.60. In relation to all loan agreements which include a clause requiringaccelerated or immediate payment of the balance of the loan followingdefault, the borrower will be entitled to apply in any Court case for aninstalment order and the Court will have power to order repayment at suchtimes and in such amounts as it thinks just having regard to the means of the borrower. The Court will take into account any contractual or statutoryrebate to which the borrower is entitled on making accelerated paymentbut, since he will in practice be paying by instalments and the lender willhave to wait for his money, the Court will be able to require interest to bepaid at such rate as appears just. The Court will have power to varyinstalment orders in subsequent proceedings.61. To protect a lender&apos;s security while an application for an instalmentorder is pending or while such an order is in operation, the Court will havepower to make orders protecting goods covered by an agreement or mortgagedas security by restricting or prohibiting their use or giving directions as totheir custody.62. It would obviously be unfair if, while a lender or supplier wasprecluded from repossessing his goods, a landlord could distrain upon or, inScotland, sequestrate them for rent due or trustees in bankruptcy could
seize them. Protection will be provided in such cases on lines similar tothe provisions of existing hire-purchase legislation, and will also covergoods comprised in bills of sale as security for loan agreements and goodshired.Death of borrower63. If a borrower dies, his family may have difficulty in maintainingpayments. Worse still, if his loan agreement requires immediate repayment of any balance outstanding on death, his family may be placed in a serious situation. The Bill will contain a number of provisions aimed at mitigatingthe problems which arise in such circumstances, while taking into acount theproper interests of lenders.64. One way of attempting to achieve this object the way which theCrowther Committee recommended would be to make void any term in a loan agreement which required accelerated repayment on the borrowersdeath; but further study has shown that this could mean that where a loanwas unsecured a lender might have to stand by while the borrowers estatewas dissipated and he irrevocably lost his money. In view of this, wherea loan is unsecured, the lender will be permitted to call for acceleratedpayment on death but, if challenged, he will have to satisfy the Court thatno adequate arrangements have been made for payment in accordancewith the original terms of the agreement. The lender is not, however, at risk where a loan is secured. The Bill will therefore render void anyterm accelerating payment on death to the extent that the outstandingbalance is secured (and the lender will likewise be precluded from enforcing the security). There will be one exception to this rule. Loans are frequentlysecured on life or endowment assurance policies taken out specifically forthe purpose of paying off that loan in the event of death, and it is clearlyright that lenders should be allowed to recoup themselves out of the proceeds of such policies.65. Such arrangements will not prejudice the lender&apos;s rights in the eventof default but, if default occurs, notice will have to be given in the waydescribed in paragraph 57 so that those administering the estate will havean opportunity to remedy the default.66. The Bill will also render void any terms in an agreement whichrestrict any rights or impose any additional liability on the death of the borrower or prevent the benefit of the agreement being transmitted on his death.Harsh terms: re-opening of agreements67. Certain pawnbrokers&apos; charges are controlled but otherwise there isno statutory control of charges for credit. There are however provisions inthe Moneylenders Acts enabling the Court to override a harsh andunconscionable agreement made by a registered moneylender and apresumption that, unless the contrary is proved, a rate of interest exceeding48. per cent per annum is excessive. Even with the additional information which he will have available to him under the new legislation before hesigns an agreement, an individual may enter into a contract in which the
lender has exercised his superior bargaining power to impose an undulyhigh rate of charge, and it is proposed to provide the consumer withprotection against this.68. The Government have decided against setting any statutory maximumrates of charge or continuing any presumption that a particular rate of charge is excessive. This is because the statute will apply to such a wide range of loans. For example, a charge of lOp for a week-end loan of  10might be regarded as unusually reasonable although it represents a rateof charge of over 100 per cent per annum; but a charge of over 20 per cent per annum for a long-term large loan very adequately secured by a mortgagemight be regarded as excessive. It would not be realistic to try to set a rate which could be reasonably applied to every type of transaction. Whethera rate is excessive essentially depends on such circumstances as the size and duration of the loan, whether it is secured or unsecured and, ifunsecured, the credit worthiness of the borrower.69. The Bill will give consumers improved protection by other means.The Court&apos;s power to re-open and override a harsh and unconscionableagreement will be extended to all consumer loan transactions, includinghire-purchase agreements, within the scope of the Bill. The Court willbe able to re-open a transaction, to set aside or alter any principal orrelated agreement and to order the lender to repay any sum already paidin excess of that which the Court adjudges to be fair. The Bill will provideguidelines for the Court to take into account, covering such matters as theamount and duration of the loan, the prevailing interest rates, the real value of any security given for the loan, the custom of the trade, and, incertain cases, the reasonableness of the cash price of the goods or services in question. The onus will be on the lender to prove that the transactionwas not harsh and unconscionable, except where a loan connected to thepurchase of goods and services with a rate of charge of less than 10 percent per annum is involved.70. The Court will also have similar power in relation to loans ofover  5,000 to consumers provided that, but for their size, they would be within the scope of the Bill.Negotiable instruments\ 71. Important elements in the protection which the legislation will givethe consumer would be of no avail if the lender could escape the obligations and restrictions placed on him. There is at present one very important escaperoute. It is possible to get a borrower to issue a promissory note or othernegotiable instrument which the seller of the goods or services can discount tosomeone else, for example a finance house, so making the latter a &apos; holder indue course&apos; whom the borrower will have to pay even if the seller fails to deliver the goods or is otherwise in breach of his contract.72. In order to prevent this happening, the Bill will forbid lenders andthose selling on credit from taking negotiable instruments other than chequesor bank notes and also forbid the taking of cheques as security. Wherecheques are taken lawfully, as a down or instalment payment and not as security, it will not be permissible to negotiate them except to banks. should negotiable instrument be taken unlawfully or a cheque be negotiated
unlawfully, the lender or supplier will not be able to enforce the agreementagainst the consumer. The Court will however have discretion to allowenforcement subject to any conditions which it considers to be just and equitable, if it is satisfied that the unlawful act was inadvertent and has notprejudiced the consumer. The Court might, for example, allow enforcementon condition that the negotiable instrument were returned.73. A negotiable instrument may nonetheless be unlawfully negotiatedto an innocent third party and the consumer will be liable to pay him as a&apos; holder in due course&apos;, even though the agreement with the lender orsupplier is unenforceable. To close this gap, the lender or supplier will bemade liable to indemnify the consumer if the latter has to pay a &apos; holder indue course&apos;.74. None of what is proposed will be inconsistent with the Bills ofExchange Act 1882 or the Cheques Act 1957 which will therefore requireno amendment.Liability of lenders for conditions and warranties for goods and servicesbought on credit.75. When a lender simply provides money which the borrower canuse wherever he likes for whatever he likes, there is no reason why the lender should be in any way liable if goods and services bought with themoney he has provided are in some way faulty, not suitable for the requiredpurpose or even never actually provided. On the other hand, there is oftena direct business link between a lender and one or more providers of goodsor services and a loan may be provided only for the purchase of goods and services from such sellers. The simplest example of this is wherea retailer offers goods on hire-purchase or on credit through the use of personal loan facilities, but the same basic conditions apply when tradingchecks or credit cards are used. While there may legally be two separatetransactions a sale and a loan the reality is, from the point of view ofthe consumer, a composite transaction and, from the point of view ofthe lender and the seller, a joint venture from which both expect to profit.76. In practice, over the years many consumers have been encouraged to buy particular goods on credit terms and the sellers have either gonebankrupt or disappeared after providing defective goods or even beforesupplying any goods at all, leaving the consumers with fully valid obligations to repay in full the loan involved. Hire-purchase legislation made thefinancier liable for conditions and warranties for goods covered by transactions which he financed. It is notable that since the passage of that legislationthere have been few complaints of difficulties in the hire-purchase field.77. Generally the borrower will continue to look to the trader for hisremedy for any misrepresentations made by him in negotiations leading to afinanced sale, for non-delivery of the goods and services and defects in them,and for any other breaches of contract for which the seller is liable. However,where any lender has a business relationship with a seller and provides creditspecifically linked to purchases from that seller, the lender will also bearliability. Lenders will be given a statutory indemnity from sellers for whosebreaches of contract or misrepresentations they will be liable. This last-mentioned provision will mean that, except where a lender has agreed to
provide credit for sales negotiated by traders of no substance, he shouldbe able to recover from the trader any loss which he may incur through thisprovision.78. Transactions involving the purchase of goods or services having a cost price not exceeding  30 will be exempt from this provision. There willalso be an upper limit so that lenders will have no liability where the cashprice of the individual goods or services in question exceeds  10,000, eventhough the loan is for less than  5,000. Thus, if for example  2,000 of theprice of an aircraft costing  15,000 is financed by a personal loan, the lender will bear no liability if the seller fails to deliver the aircraft or isotherwise in breach of his contract.Other provisionsThe taking and realisation of pledges79. The transactions of pawnbrokers and others taking pledges, no lessthan those of other lenders, will be subject to the general provisions of theBill. Since the special restrictions now applying specifically to pawnbrokerswill end with the repeal of the Pawnbrokers Act, it will be necessary to enactrevised provisions governing the taking and realisation of pledges of goods;these will apply whether or not the lender calls himself a pawnbroker. TheBill will not affect existing law governing the security aspects of themortgaging (commonly called pledging) of intangible property.80. The three categories into which the Pawnbrokers Act 1872 dividespawnbrokers&apos; loans will be replaced by a different arrangement. A pledgewill be redeemable for six months or for any longer period upon which theparties may agree. If a pledge for a loan not exceeding  15 and for notmore than six months is not redeemed, it will become the lender&apos;s absoluteproperty. If the loan exceeds  15 or if it does not exceed  15 but has arepayment period of more than six months, the pledge may be realised by the lender upon the expiry of the redemption period, but it will remain redeem-able on payment of the sum due until it is actually realised. Moreover, the lender will not be entitled to make any additional charge for late redemptionapart from reasonable expenses such as expenditure on storage orinsurance.81. Where a pledge is not redeemed and does not become the lender&apos;sabsolute property, he will be required to take reasonable care to obtain a proper price when disposing of it and the onus will be on him to show that he took such care and that the expenses of the sale were reasonable. the lender will also be required to give the borrower reasonable notice of anysale of such pledge where it is not by advertised public auction. When salepf a pledge has taken place, the lender will have to pay the borrower any surplus remaining after deducting the amount of the loan and reasonableexpenses. Equally, the borrower will remain liable for any deficit. the lender will be required to provide the borrower with a statement setting outthe price obtained, the expenses of the sale and any surplus due to him or deficit due to the lender.82. The holder of the original copy of the relevant agreement (pawnreceipt) will be presumed to be entitled to redeem a pledge, unless the lenderknows or has been warned that this is not so.  If the pawn receipt is lost,
the borrower will be able to make a declaration before a Justice or Commis-sioner for Oaths or, where the loan does not exceed  15 and the lenderagrees, he may make a declaration informally.83. As has already been stated, the Bill will provide that failure togive to borrowers copies of loan agreements will render them unenforceableagainst the borrower. However, where a loan is secured on a pledge, the lender has only to retain the pledge to enforce the security. Therefore,while failure to supply a copy of an agreement will not generally be a criminal offence, the Bill will make this an offence where a pledge is taken,just as it is now an offence to fail to provide a pawn ticket.84. It will be an offence to take a pledge from a child apparently underthe age of 16 years.Liability, of holders of credit cards, checks, vouchers,, and similar creditinstruments85. The convenience which credit cards possess as la method of makingpurchases without cash and with the minimum of formality has the dis-advantage that they carry an unique risk of use by unauthorised persons.Even if only a short time elapses before the holder discovers his loss, afraudulent user can easily run up accounts to the full credit limit. Inpractice, card issuers now in business either limit the liability of the cardholder in bona fide cases of loss or theft, or do not in practice seek toenforce any legal rights in full, but it is not impossible that others will issue cards and prove less solicitous of their customers. It is therefore considered that a statutory limit should be placed on the liability of theconsumer.86. The Bill will provide that there should be no liability until the holderor user authorised by him has either signed the credit card himself or a receiptfor it, or has used it. If thereafter the card is lost or stolen, or if unauthoriseduse occurs for some other reason, the holder&apos;s liability will cease as soonas the issuer is notified (provided that oral notification, for example by telephone, is confirmed in writing if this is required by the issuer). Theextent of the holder&apos;s liability for debts incurred through misuse of a credit card prior to notification of its loss or theft will be no more than theamount of the unauthorised use, the credit limit set for the use of the cardor  30, whichever is the least.87. The burden of proving that a credit card was issued in accordancewith the provisions of the statute, or that any use which the holder claims to have been unauthorised was actually authorised or occurred before noticeof loss had been given, will lie with the issuer.88. These provisions will also apply to trading checks, vouchers andany other like instrument which requires only such action as signature bythe recipient to become a valid means of obtaining credit.Guarantors (sureties) and indemnifies89. Sometimes a borrower or hirer is required to find someone willingto guarantee payments under a loan or hiring agreement. He may thenask a relative, friend or workmate to act as guarantor (surety) or indemnifier,23
without specifying just what is involved. The person taking on this responsibility does not always realise that he may face heavy demands ifthe borrower or hirer defaults on his agreement; indeed, at present he mayface greater or more onerous liabilities than the borrower or hirer assumedunder the original agreement.90. Indemnifiers are in particular need of protection; while a guarantor^liability cannot by its nature exceed or be more onerous than that of theprincipal debtor, an indemnifier may incur a heavier burden. For example,he might be required to pay the outstanding balance of a loan in a lump sum even though the borrower would have been allowed to pay in instalments.The principle underlying the Bill&apos;s provisions will be that anyone securing a loan, by guarantee, indemnity or any other means, should not have to accept any greater liability than the person whose loan is being secured and accordingly should enjoy the same measure of protection as the Bill will afford borrowers and hirers. He will thus have similar rights as to the content and supply of documents and notices of default. Moreover, anagreement or clause in an agreement which is unenforceable against aborrower or hirer will likewise be unenforceable against him. In addition,the Bill will make it clear that his total liability may not be more onerousthan that of the principal debtor.91. There will be one necessary exception to this rule. Anyone securing a loan will be liable as if the borrower or hirer were an adult when he is infact a minor and therefore has no legal liability. Without this exception, itwould be very difficult for persons under 18 to procure any goods on creditor hire.Protection of purchasers of motor vehicles subject to hire-purchase agreements92. It is intended that Part III of the Hire-Purchase Act 1964 by whicha private purchaser of a motor vehicle still subject to a hire-purchase agree-ment gets good title to that vehicle, provided that he buys in good faithwithout being aware of the existence of that agreement will remain in force.Licensing proposals93. The Moneylenders and Pawnbrokers Acts impose licensing on thoseoffering loans of money to consumers. Certain bodies were exempted fromthese licensing provisions, including banks which, at the time of theirenactment, did not generally seek to finance consumer credit transactions.Retailers and others offering hire-purchase, conditional sale and credit sale and certain other forms of consumer credit are not covered by them. More-over, in recent years, a considerable number of finance houses providingconsumer credit have been recognised as banks as they have developed their business and thus have been exempted from these provisions.94. The net result of the existing patchwork of licensing of someand freedom for others (combined with protection for the consumer insome types of transaction but not in others) has been to inhibit severelycompetition between different types of credit grantor and to encourage thegrowth of some types of transaction which may not be the most beneficialfor the consumer. Following the recommendations of the Crowther Com-mittee, the Bill will sweep away entirely the Moneylenders and Pawnbrokers
Acts and provide for the licensing by the Consumer Credit Commissioner(see paragraphs 15 and 16 above) of all those offering consumer credit orhiring facilities within the general scope of the Bill, as well as those acting as intermediaries, debt counsellors, debt collectors and credit referenceor rating agencies. All those holding credit grantors&apos; licences will be subjectto exactly the same rules and regulations and will normally be free to offerany type of credit facility although the Commissioner will have powerto restrict the scope of individual licences. For door-to-door canvassinga supplementary licence will be required as explained in paragraph 33.There will thus for the first time in a century be the possibility of realcompetition, fairly supervised in the interests of the consumer, between different types of credit grantor and no artificial barriers favouring orinhibiting the development of particular types of transaction. Modest fees,to cover the cost of administration of the scheme, will be charged for licences.95. There will be separate licences issued for particular types of activity e.g. credit grantor, intermediary between grantors and consumers, debtcounsellor etc. but a person or company will require only one licence tocover the relevant activity of all his business outlets. Subsidiary and parentcompanies will, however, require separate licences. Power will be taken toissue group licences covering the business of categories of persons or ofthose engaging in a particular activity. This power would make it possible,for example, to issue a single group licence covering solicitors generally and thus exempt them individually from the need to seek a licence. Grouplicences might also cover the activities of all suppliers of goods on hireor of traders acting as intermediaries between consumers who are buyingtheir goods and services and credit grantors financing these transactions, butonly when these traders receive no commission or other payment from the credit grantor. It will be possible to exempt a named individual or company from the coverage of a group licence.96. The Bill will exempt local authorities and certain named statutorybodies from the licensing requirement, and there will be power to exemptpartially or wholly the business of other bodies. Private individuals andthose in business who may occasionally enter into transactions within thescope of the Bill, but who do not hold themselves out as offering such facilities in the course of trade, will not require a licence.97. The Secretary of State will have power to lay down rules of businessconduct to be observed as a condition of having a licence. The commissioner will have power to vary, suspend or revoke existing licences.98. It is also intended to give practical effect to two recommendations contained in the report of the Committee on Privacy under the chairmanship of the Right Hon. Sir Kenneth Younger.* These were that the activities of credit reference and rating agencies should be kept under review by theConsumer Credit Commissioner and that an individual should have a legally enforceable right of access to the information held about him by suchan agency. Under the Bill these agencies will be required to disclose to individuals, on request and on payment of a modest fee, information about them held on record, and to amend their records where these can be shown to be wrong.* Cmnd. 5012.25 .
99. The Consumer Credit Commissioner will not have power to restrict the issue of licences in order to regulate competition in the trade or forany other particular commercial purpose. Rather his function will be toprotect the consumer from exploitation by this means. His powers willenable him to refuse a licence in any case where it appears to him that theapplicant is not a fit person.100. This power could be used, in particular, when an applicant hadbeen convicted of offences under the Bill or other legislation protecting theconsumer. The Commissioner will also be able to take into account conductwhich is unfair to consumers (for example, breach of contract or use in contracts of clauses made void by the Bill), the making of loans to consumersat excessive rates of interest, any practice of refusing credit solely on thegrounds of sex or race, and the breaking of any conduct of business ruleslaid down.101. The Bill will make provision for appeal by an applicant refuseda licence or refused one on the terms requested or a licence holder whoselicence is varied, revoked or suspended.Enforcement102. Many of the provisions of the Bill will provide grounds forrecourse by the individual to the Court for enforcement of his contractualrights or for relief from his contractual obligations. The Bill will provide that County Courts or, in Scotland, Sheriff Courts will have exclusivejurisdiction over actions brought against borrowers founded on enforcementor breach of all loan or hiring agreements which it covers and of ancillaryagreements relating, for example, to insurance or the maintenance of equipment.103. The Crowther Committee recognised that an individual could beput to great disadvantage if a creditor bringing an action could choose aCourt at a distance from that individual^ place of residence or business.They therefore recommended that creditors should be required to commenceactions in the Court for the district in which the defendant was residing orcarrying on business at the time of the action. It is intended to take appropriate steps to give effect to this recommendation.104. The Bill will also create a number of criminal offences, such asissuing misleading advertisements or undertaking credit business whenunlicensed. The Crowther Committee recommended that consideration begiven to the extent to which the local Weights and Measures Authorities could undertake enforcement of new consumer credit legislation. The Govern-ment have concluded that, in view of their fund of experience and localknowledge, the Authorities are well fitted to discharge this function. Sinceenforcement will be needed both at the national and local level, the bill will provide both the Consumer Credit Commissioner and local weights and Measures Authorities with powers of enforcement. The intention will bethat cases of mainly local significance should be investigated by Weights and measures Inspectorates with a view to prosecution, while the commissioner should deal with those of a wider significance (for example, misleading
advertisements carried by national newspapers). Weights and MeasuresAuthorities will be required to inform the Commissioner of proposed prose-cutions  in advance so that concerted action can be taken when appropriate.105. It will be open to the Commissioner to recommend to theDirector General of Fair Trading that proceedings be taken under Part iii of the Fair Trading Act 1973 to stop any business conduct in the credit andhiring field which is unfair to consumers and which he is unable to preventeither through persuasion or through use of powers included in this Bill.The Restrictive Practices Court or, in certain circumstances, a county court (or, in Scotland, a Sheriff Court) might then make an Order to prohibit such conduct.Conclusion106. The recommendations of the Crowther Committee were generally welcomed by all. Passage of the Bill outlined in this White Paper will mean the start of a new era in consumer credit. The industry will be freed fromoutdated restrictions and, for the first time, the consumer will have compre-hensive protection and that truth in lending which is so necessary if he is to choose rationally. There will also be sufficient flexibility to allow for thedevelopment of new types of credit business. Thus a framework will havebeen established for further development of the industry which will be fair both to the provider of credit and to the consumer.

If the request for information was in respect of fixed-sum credit or hireand it did not specify the particular goods or services it was proposed to purchasewith the credit, or the size of the credit required, or the goods it was proposedto hire, then the advertiser might either:(i) supply not less than two examples of &apos; typical&apos; terms (see paragraph 4of Section A) supplementing the terms with other information requiredfor a specific advertisement of the credit or hire in question; or(ii) supply a quotation showing the maximum rate of charge made onany loan or the maximum charges made on any hire from hisestablishment.In either case, a statement would have to be added to the effect that more precise details could be given once the information not given by the enquirer(plus anything more required by the creditor or owner) was supplied. Once this further information was supplied, a complete quotation would have to be given.

Accuracy It would not be a breach to quote a rate higher than the oneproduced by the formula or to round the rate produced by formula to thenearer \ per cent where this was lower. (For example, 10-86 per cent couldbe called 10% per cent, 10-86 per cent or any rate higher than 10-86 per cent;10-88 per cent could be called 10-88 per cent or any rate higher than 10-88per cent but could not be called I0J per cent.)

[Forthis purpose the present value at an annual rate of charge of i percent of a sum payable in r years time would be taken to be that. rsum divided by (1 -I-  1 ). where r is expressed in complete years100and/or fractions of a year]*(ii) in all advertisements of fixed-sum credit where the instalments were of equal size and were to be repaid at equal intervals and the termof the credit did not exceed 48 months, it would be calculated by thefollowing formula:200mddp (n -f 1) -f- - (n - 3m -f- 2).      T   .   ^  .&apos; .      3 &apos;    &apos;      &quot;(iii) in all advertisements of fixed-sum credit repayable in a lump sum(principal, interest and all charges), it would be calculated by thefollowing formula:100K1 + -) -i]p(iv) in all advertisements of fixed-sum credit where the rate of charge/interest was computed on the balance outstanding but there was nopredetermined length of contract, repayment period or amount ofinstalment, the effective annual equivalent of the period rate wouldhave to be shown, calculated by the following formula:100K1 +^/ -i] &apos;(v) in all advertisements of running-account credit the basis of the calculation of the period rate of charge would have to be shown,together with the effective annual equivalent of the period rate onthe basis of annual compounding, calculated by the followingformula:-     iooKi + ^7 -i]    .In the formulae quoted above:m^ number of instalments per annumn^ total number of instalmentsp=amount borrowedd^the charge for credit in cash terms calculated in accordance with paragraph 8t^the term of the credit in yearsx=period rate chargedy=number of periods in a year.* &apos; r&apos; is an index and can be expressed as &apos; the rth power of one-hundredth of that rateincreased by unity&apos;.
9.5.1. Exemptions from the Requirement to State an Annual Percentage Rateof Charge There would be no requirement for a statement of an annualpercentage rate of charge in advertisements exempted under (i), (ii), (iii), (v)and (a), (6) and (c) of (vi) of paragraph 8.4.1 from showing any charge for credit.9.5.2. In any advertisement of running-account credit (other than thoseexempted under paragraph 9.5.1) in which it was desired to show examples of thevarious uses of the facility and the various options open to the debtor, theactual annual percentage rate for the examples given might be shown on condition that at least two such examples were shown in each advertisement.Variations in the Charge for Credit and I or Rate of Charge10.

APPENDIX IIIRebates for Early settlement the Right1. Subject to the exceptions set out in paragraph 4 below, a debtor under anagreement for consumer credit for which any charge was made would be entitledto a minimum rebate of the charge for credit whenever full repayment of the credit was made, offered or required (no matter by whom and no matterwhether by voluntary request, acceleration by contractual liability or court action)at a date earlier than originally anticipated in the contract.2. The &apos; charge for credit&apos; referred to above would include all the elements of charge to be included in the rate of charge calculations to be disclosed in anagreement, but with the one exception that in calculating the rebate creditorsmight, if they so wished, deduct from the charge any element that was payableas a registration fee for a mortgage of land or any other fee payable to theLand Registry.3. The refinancing by the original or a linked creditor (to be defined) ofan existing indebtedness should be deemed to constitute an early settlement forthe purpose of qualification for the rebate.Exceptions4. There would be no requirement to provide a rebate in the followingtransactions:(i) any fixed-sum credit facility where the amount of the credit was lessthan  30; or(ii) any fixed-sum credit facility where the contractual life of the creditwas 26 weeks or less. The fact that credit was expressed as beingpayable or repayable on demand should not render it as credit for aperiod of less than 26 weeks if the agreement, implicitly or explicitly,also included a provision either that the creditor at his discretion mightpermit payment by instalments over a period in excess of 26 weeksor the debtor had a contractual right to extend the date of repayment of the credit or part of the credit to a date beyond 26 weeks.5. Excluded from these rebate provisions by the definition in paragraph would be:(i) any fixed-sum credit transaction where the credit price was the sameas the cash price; or(ii) any running-account system which might only be used for restricted-use credit where the price charged to the consumer for the purchaseunder the facility was the cash price and no additional chargewhatsoever was made for credit, the servicing of the account, the credit facility or any other items whatsoever; or(iii) any credit facility where the debtor had the option of paying in- full or by instalments and where the charge for credit was regularlyadded to the amount outstanding and repayments deducted, so thatthe total balance (principal and charges) outstanding at any time was known.  (See also paragraph 19 below.)Formulae6. Subject to paragraphs 8 and 10 below, the rebate would be ascertained bycalculating, as at the date the credit was made, the sum of the products, for eachinstalment, of the amount of the instalments and the length of time before that
instalment fell due; then making a similar calculation as at the date of repayment(or at such later date as might be permitted (see paragraph 18)); the ratio ofthe second amount to the first should then be applied to the total charge for credit to give the rebate.7. For example, if a credit of  100 was repayable by two instalments, one of 50 after six months from the date of contract and one of  60 after eight months from the date of contract and the debtor wished to repay after three months,the rebate (ignoring the loading factor in paragraph 18 below) would be: 50 X 3 4  60 X 5-:-X  10 (the total charge for credit) 50 X 6 -f  60 X 8450or - of the total charge for credit of  10.7808. Where the credit was repayable in equal instalments at regular intervalsthe rebate would be calculated by using &apos; the Rule of 78&apos;; viz, if there were originally n instalments and the debtor wished to pay the remaining instalmentsin one lump sum t intervals before the date of the final instalment (or suchlater date as might be permitted (see paragraph 18)), the rebate to which het(t H- 1)would be entitled would be-times the total charge for credit.n(n + 1)9. For example, if credit of  100 was repayable by 11 monthly instal-ments of  10 and the debtor wished to repay at the end of the fifth month, nwould be 11 and t would be 6, so that the rebate (ignoring the loading factor inparagraph 18 below) would be:6(6 -f 1) -X  10 (the total charge for credit)11(11 -t- 1)42     7or-or   of the total charge for credit of  10.132    2210. Where repayment of the credit was envisaged by a lump sum (principalplus charge for credit) repayable at the end of an agreed period, the rebateawould be calculated by using the formula - times the total charge for credit,bwhere a = the period of the credit outstanding (or such later date as might be permitted (see paragraph 18)) and b - the original period of the credit.11. For example, if credit of  100 was repayable in 12 months&apos; time withan interest charge of  10 and the debtor wished to pay after three months had elapsed, a would be 9 and b would be 12 so that the rebate (ignoring theloading factor in paragraph 18 below) would be:9  X  10 (the total charge for credit).12
Rules for the Application of the Formulae12 Determination of Regular Contracts Any fixed-sum credit thatwas not repayable in equal payments might for these purposes be considered to be repayable by equal payments when the variation in repayments was notmore than  5 or 20 per cent of the amount payable in respect of any of theother instalments, whichever of these two amounts were the lesser.13. Any fixed-sum credit, repayable in quarterly, monthly or weeklyinstalments, where the length of time between the granting of the credit andthe final repayment date was not an exact number of quarters, months or weeks,might, for these purposes, be considered as being the nearer exact number.14. Date of Quotation Save in credit repayable in a lump sum (where therebate quotation would have to be calculated on the date the request wasreceived) the rebate quotation would be calculated from the instalment due datenearest the date when the request was received (or the contractual liabilitybecame effective or on such date as a Court might order).15. For example, in a monthly instalment contract, a request received on or before the 15th day following an instalment date should be treated as made onthat instalment date; a request received on or after the 16th day following aninstalment date should be treated as made on the next instalment date.16. Variable Rate of Charge Where the rate of charge in the agreement was variable, the rebate would be calculated on the rate prevailing on the date the request for early settlement was received.17. Date of Settlement Subject to paragraph 14, any settlement quotationwould have to be based upon the state of the account between the parties onthe day the quotation was made and would be binding on the parties for 21days after it had been given.Deductions18. Loading Factor- Except for re-financing credit creditors might, if they so wished, calculate the rebate from a date three months after the date ofquotation (see paragraph 14), but, if the agreement required notice of termina-tion, such notice period would have to be included in this three months.Redemption Fees or Penalties19. In any credit facility where the charge for credit was regularly addedto the amount outstanding and repayments deducted (so that the total balance(principal and charges) outstanding at any time was known and where the debtorhad the option of paying in full or by instalments) he would be entitled at anytime to pay the full amount outstanding at that date with no penalty, additionalcharge or charge for advance interest.20. The charging of a fee for a quotation for redemption or early settlement,no matter how expressed, would not be permitted.Variations21. Any creditor operating a credit scheme (other than one exempted under paragraph 4 above) to which because of its method of operation the above rulescould not apply or where it would be inequitable to apply them would berequired to provide a rebate for early settlement provision acceptable to theConsumer Credit Commissioner.Printed in England by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office3143022  Dd. 139309  K     9/73
