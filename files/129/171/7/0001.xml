Thiswas to assist us to discuss the strategic priorities and the balance whichwe ought now to strike between the different expenditure programmes(CM(73) 38th Conclusions^ Minute 7).2. Total public expenditure is equivalent to about 50 per cent of gross domestic product.    The attached table and chart show the proportions oftotal public expenditure represented by the main programmes in 1970-71,1973-74 and, as costed for the 1973 Survey but before taking account ofadditional bids, 1977-78.    The table also shows the rates of increase ofthe individual programmes between these years.    The figures are in costterms including the relative price effect.    The relatively high rates of growth in the earlier period up to 1973-74 reflect the Governmentsadditions to expenditure in that period, largely to help to deal with unemployment and regional problems^A treasury Chambers24 July 1973COPY NO -67CABINET
