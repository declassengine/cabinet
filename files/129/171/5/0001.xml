THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST VS government copy NO       67CABINETCHANNEL TUNNEL,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. The Minister for Transport Industries circulated to Membersof the Cabinet a draft White Paper prepared on the basis indicated bythe Prime Minister in his summing up of our discussion on 5 July(CM(73) 35th Conclusions, Minute 6).    His covering minute explainedthat the negotiations with the private interests over the terms for financing the Channel Tunnel have not yet been completed.2. The draft White Paper is thus complete except for the proposals relating to the financial arrangements with the Companies.    If thenegotiations reach a successful outcome, the appropriate insertion canbe made.    If they do not, the whole draft will require to be revised inthe light of our eventual decisions.3. I invite my colleagues to approve the draft as the basis for a white Paper to be issued at an early date if the negotiations are success-ful.    We can consider the handling and timing of publication in the lightof the progress of the financial negotiations on which a further oralreport will be made to Cabinet.G r department of the Environment23 July 1973CP(73) 8524 July 1973
PRIME MINISTERCHANNEL TUNNELThe Secretary of State for the Environment is in brussels today and with his agreement I am reporting on the current position.Financial negotiations continue but some distancestill separates the Governments from the Companies.It seems certain that we shall not reach agreement intime to enable us to. make a final decision and announceit before the House rises.We should, however, reach finality in the next week or two and it is highly desirable that we shouldmake known our decision without delay.     The announcement,as we have agreed,  should take the form of a White Paper.In these circumstances, we propose to proceed asfollows:(a) a draft White Paper, complete except forthe proposals relating to the financial arrangements with the companies, will be circulated to the Cabinet today.    I proposethat this should be taken at the next meetingof the Cabinet on 26th July.(b) If the French Minister and I have reached agreement with the Companies by that time,a report should accordingly be made to theCabinet seeking approval for immediatepublication of the White Paper, with theinclusion of the financial terms.(c) If agreement with the Companies has notbeen reached by that time, the report should seek approval to the text of the White paper as it stands but its publication, whichwould depend on the satisfactory outcome ofthe financial negotiations, would be subjectto further approval.(d) In either event, the White Paper would bepublished during the Recess.      In order topave the way for it, I should make a statementafter Questions next week, explaining thecurrent situation and how we then propose toproceed.     I attach a draft of its text.- 1 -
(e)    In the- event that our decision is to go ahead with the project,  there would beannexed to the White Paper draft clauses of the Money Bill which we would presentand seek to pass immediately on the resumption in October.I seek my colleagues&apos; agreement to proceedingaccordingly. ,,I am circulating this to members of the1!

CONFIDENTIALCHANNEL TUNNELDRAFT STATEMENT FOR MINISTER  (TI) TO MAKE TO THE HOUSE OF COMMONS/With permission etc  ..\7The House will recall that on 15th June I said thatif there were an affirmative decision on the ChannelTunnel I would announce this and publish a short MoneyBill before the Recess.Financial negotiations between my French colleagueand myself and the private interests are still continuingbut they have not yet reached a conclusion.     This is a necessary stage which must be reached before theGovernment take their decision on the project as a whole and I am therefore not yet able to announce a decision tothe House.The Government&apos;s decision, when it is taken, &quot;will be announced in the form of a White Paper.   - If that decision were an affirmative one, draft clauses of a Money bill which I would propose to introduce into the Houseimmediately we resume in October would be annexed to theWhib&amp; Paper.As the House will realise, this means that the white paper is likely to be published during the Recess.     i recognise and sympathise with the distaste of hon. members for the publication of important statements when the house is not sitting.      I am sure, however, that the House will- 1
- 2 -agree that it would be wrong for the Government to takea decision on a matter of this importance before all aspects of the proposals, including the financing terms,had been satisfactorily resolved.     On the other hand,once a decision is reached, it would be wrong to delayannouncing it.     We wish to provide the fullest possible opportunity for it to be considered, by the public aswell as hon. Members, before we resume in October.
-CONFIDENTIALDRAFT WHITE PAPER - /   ..      ,CHANNEL TUNNELSUMMARY AND conclusions,     Following the completion of the studies carried out over thepast two years, the Government have concluded that it would be inthe national interest for a bored rail tunnel to be constructedunder the Channel.   They have agreed with the French Governmentand the international interests concerned arrangements forcarrying the project forward on the lines developed by successiveAdministrations.o &apos; ....2.     The Tunnel would link both the rail and road systems of thiscountry and the Continent,   The associated development of a newhigh quality rail link to London would allow British Railways to exploit to the full the potential for through passenger and freightservices.    In addition a &quot;rolling motorway&quot; of vehicle ferrytrains would link the M20 in Kent with the Continental motorwaysystem near Calais.    &apos;3.     The Tunnel is estimated to co3t  !i68m in 1973 prices ( 8li6million in out-turn prices including allowance for inflation,interest during construction and financing charges), to be sharedbetween Britain and France;   the rail link to London would cost1some  120m (in 1973 prices).Ii.     The project is technically feasible, would be a cheaper wayof providing for the ever increasing demand for cross Channeltraffic than relying solely on the expansion of- existing means, andwould be commercially profitable.   It would be on balance havoreal advantages for the environment.CONFIDENTIAL   &apos;.&apos;
$. &apos;   The Tunnel would be financed and constructed by aninternational group of banking and obhor interests who wouldsubscribe a proportion of the money at risk and would raise theremainder with the help of guarantees given by the French andBritish Governments.    Finance sentence to follow^   On completionthe Tunnel would be handed over for operation to an Anglo-Frenchauthority set up by the Governments. These arrangements representa unique partnership of public and private interest on aninternational basis.,.6.     The Government aro presenting to Parliament a Bill to providelimited financial powers for the next phase of initial works. If theBill is passed by the end of this session the Governmentwill be able to sign a main Agreement No, 2 with the private interests and a Treaty with France.   The main proposals for theconstruction and operation of the Tunnel system would be incorporated in a major hybrid Bill to be presented to Parliament .in the forthcoming session.   Only if and when this Bill has been passed could the Anglo-French Treaty be ratified and AgreementNo. 3 signed with the private interests, and the major works andraising of the bulk of the finance undertaken.   In other wordsParliament would not be making a final decision before summer 197I+.CONFIDENTIAL

Ii-, 1K0J Jw 110W . !Nrr ? L/   ? ^ ! IA L1.1      The British and French Governments have, after consideringthe results of two year3 of work, agreed between themselves andwith the privato interests concerned that the proposed ChannolTunnel project should proceed on linos which have boon progressivelydeveloped over the last ton years by successive administrations.They.are accordingly sooking from Parliament the nocossary poworsto enable them to enter into the next stage (Phase 11)-*.Certain initial works would be undertaken while the powers needed for construction and operation of the Tunnel system as a whole were sought.   While it would not be necessary to undertake a finalcommitment to the main works until 197!?. it is the Governmentspresent intention that, subject to the agreement of Parliament and provided there are no unexpected developments, the Tunnel shouldbe built.1.2     The Government&apos;s decision is based on the need to providefor the rapid and continuing growth of Cross Channel traffic and upon the belief that a rail tunnel would not only be the cheapestand most efficient means of doing so but that it would also bethe least damaging from an environmental point of view.    It wouldhave the added advantage of conferring real benefits upon the.Railways.     . ** The Tunnel project is divided into a series of phases withbreakpoints in between:    Phase I covering the main technical,economic and financial studies, Phase II the initial works, andPhase III the main construction of the Tunnel system.
2.    TIIE TUNNEL PROJECT--lX* *UU * 1 ,ML2.1   The Tunnel itself would run between Cheriton near Folkestoneand Sangatte near Calais.    There would be a new high quality raillink between Folkestone and London connecting through the Tunnel witha similar route to Paris and Brussels.    The project as a whole v/ouldconnect not only the rail&apos; systems of Britain and the Continent butalso their road networks, through the provision of special vehicleferry trains * jj2*2   A description of the Tunnel, was given in Chapter 3 of the green Papers published in March this year; for convenience the keypoints are summarised here.   There would be three tunnels 32 mileslong of v/hich 23 miles would be undersea - two main running tunnelseach carrying a single railway track; these would be linked by anumber of crossovers to permit sections of each line to be taken out of service without closing a complete tunnel. A service tunnelbetween and beneath the main tunnels would be connected to themby cross-passages every 250 yards.    .This would provide easy accessfor maintenance and inspection and accommodate such services aselectricity, ventilation and drainage, as well as providing a meansof evacuation in the event of an incident.   The general lay-outis shown in the diagram at Plate 1*Types of services .3   The Tunnel would be not merely a connection between theFolkestone and Calais areas, but also a key link in the Europeanrail network. * -2,k   There would be two main types of service through the tunnel:(a) through rail passenger, &quot;Motorail&quot; and freight*The Channel Tunnel - Cmnd 5256.

services (including &quot;Freightllner11 type container services)between centres in Britain and the Continent;(b)    ferry train services for freight and passenger roadvehicles.Trains would be hauled by electrical power, based on the 25 kV,overhead AC system which is now standard for new electrificationschemes on British and French Railways.   There would be no discrimination between road and rail.Through Ra.il Services .2.5   Both the Government and the British Railways Board attach the highest importance to the development of through rail services.For the first time the.British and Continental railway systemswould be directly connected.   This Would provide British Railwith a major new opportunity to co mpete for traffic over longerdistances.   This, in turn, would provide an opportunity for the diversion of at least part of our increasing cross-Channel traffic form the roads serving the ports.. 1N,ew,.Jiigh quality, route     .&apos; .206   The -British Railways Board consider and the Government agree,a new high-quality route between London and the Tunnel terminalwould be essential.   It.would be electrified on the 25 kV overheadsystem, built to the Continental loading gauge and suitable for eventual very high speed running. This would, incidentally, provide some relief for the congested Southern Region, by removing theboat trains from the existing route. * ;-;2.7   After considering a number of alternatives, British Rail have established the feasibility of a route (Plate 5) which they proposeto discuss further with the local authorities; they will bring theirfirm proposals before Parliament by means of a private bill.:0
la?s tooconstricted and its approaches and surrounding area are too congestedfor it to accommodate the greatly increased passenger trafficattracted by the Tunnel.    BR, having looked at a number of sites, re-commended that a new terminal should be built at White City which hasadequate space, good road communications and London transport facilities and would permit convenient through running to the provincesThe possibility that limited facilities for day-time passenger servicesmight be provided at Victoria is also under examination.    For freight,it is thought that existing Freightliner depots will be sufficient,but the site for handling wagonload traffic has not yet been selected.c.    Proposed Through services .9   The British and Continental railways are now planning for the -following types of through services (which are illustrated in the sketch maps at Plates 6 and 7).2.10   There would be hourly departures of Inter-City trains throughoutthe day from London to Paris and to Brussels via Lille.    As shown inPlate 6a, a number of through services would be provided from the start from provincial centres in Britain, while some day services onthe Brussels route would run on to Amsterdam or Cologne.    Trains areexpected to take 3 hours J4.O minutes initially from London to Paris and3 hours 25 minutes to Brussels.    The trains would be fully air-conditioned and provide restaurant and buffet services.2,11    A few years after the Tunnel opens in 1 980, following theintroduction of very high speed trains (160 mph and upwards) andthe completion of the French and Belgian high speed route betweenParis, Brussels and the Channel Tunnel, the journey between Londonand Paris might take around 2 hours I4.O minutes and that between london and Brussels slightly less, with corresponding savingsfor other destinations.i.Passenger Services
CONFIDENTIAL   &apos;      &quot;2,&apos;12   A wide range o:C destinations in Krilnrn and the Continentwould be serv.ci&apos;2 from the outset by. overnight sleeping car trains/Plate   7a   J7.2.13 A network of Motorail services to carry accompanied cars would Ibe provided from the start /Plate 7b       and extended to meet&quot;-demand,   f2.1U   Charter travel has shown what can be done to cut air fareswhich at normal rates would add too much to the cost of a holiday. . &apos;The railways are fully aware of the potential and would compete inall distance ranges where trains might prove attractive..  Suchtrains would normally operate overnight, with couchette accommodation and at bargain fares. : &apos;   -:ii *   Freight. services ,1&apos;5   Freightliner-type &quot;block&quot; train services for&apos; timetabled movementof unit-load traffic in containers at high speed would operate fromthe start between principal centres here and on the Continent(see Plate, 6b   ).   Other international freightliner-type services would connect with the domestic British services.   Customs clearancewould be speeded up and frontier delays eliminated by the use of inland clearance depots.   Overall transit times and charges shouldbe highly competitive&apos;with other forms of surface transport.   TheTunnel wo&apos;uld be very suitable for through movement by rail ofperishables, especially fruit and vegetables, from the importantproducing areas of France, Spain and Italy.   It would also be-very suitable for individual trains carrying bulk traffics&apos; such aschemicals, steel, china clay&apos; or new cars between Great Britain andthe Continent.   Such services would be negotiated individually and operate mainly to and from private sidings, using rolling stock &apos;specially designed and built to the customers&apos; requirements.&apos;BR   &apos;   &apos;are also exploring the opportunities for wagonload services.CONFIDENTIAL
gcrry Services2o16   The terminals would.be at Cheriton,  just north of Folkestone,and at Sangatte near Calais.   The railway layout at each terminalwould be in the form of a loop so that ferry trains could enter the loading platforms at one end and leave at the other,  therebyavoiding conflicting movements and the need for ferry trains toreverseo   A plan of the proposed terminal is at Plate li and the ,design is discussed in detail in paragraphs 8.1). to 8.7.2.17   A frequent shuttle service of drive-on/drive-off trains betweenthe ferry terminals would provide virtually a &quot;rolling motorway&quot; forroad traffic; they could if necessary run at least every four minutesat peak periods. They would carry cars, coaches, caravans and similarvehicles in single or double-deck wagons.   Lorries and trailers,would be carried separately in single-deck wagons.   Some of thelatter might be open-sided with special enclosed seating areas forthe drivers, but all the other ferry trains would be fully enclosed.The drivers could remain in their vehicles during the 35-minutejourney, or move about inside the wagons.   As explained in the green Paper the results of experiments by the Transport and road research Laboratory&quot;&apos; to assess the time taken to load and unload &apos;the ferry trains and the rate at which passengers could jfassthrough the emergency exits are being taken into account in the&quot;design studies, &apos;. .2.18   There would be a frequent and reliable service, which wouldnot be subject to interruption nor made personally uncomfortable bybad weather.   The overall time from entry to one terminal toemerging from the other is expected to be about one hour for passengervehicles - faster than by the existing sea services . Advance bookingwould not be required.*TKRL Koporto LR h35 and .iij56 10

It would be lined withprefabricated sections, of either concrete orcast-iron, inserted mechanically immediatelybehind tho boring machine, even though the material is such that&apos; the. tunnels would stand up on theirown and, except for a section at the French-end,would not admit much water. -British and French Consulting Engineers have carried out independent studies of the detailed ;requirements for tho tunnel linings and havereached similar conclusions.   The choice betweenforms of lining (cast-iron, steel, precast concreteand   in-situ concrete) would depend on technical and supply considerations.   The designs for thoservice tunnel.

As a result it has beendecided that separate pressure-relieving cross passagesshould link the two running tunnels.    Special attention  &apos;-.has been paid to the needs for ventilation, both in.normal circumstances and in the- event of an incident;;more than adequate provision has been included in the.design.   Y/hile current studies suggest that any buildup of heat in the Tunnels would be so gradual that     &apos;provision for cooling-would not be needed in the first few years.&quot; CONFIDENTIAL \s
Possible long term needs are being taken into account and willbe defined as a result of experience of the tunneling in rhasell.The British Railways Research and Medical Departments, in association with.Leeds University,have examined the implications of the changes of pressure .set up when a train moving at speed in a tunnel passesthe cross passages;    the provision of adequate reliofducts will ensure that there will be no danger ofuncomfortable changes of pressure.

aConcurrent studios by the Governments,a*     Safety in Operation . &apos; .   .3.5   Concurrently with the Phase 1 to clinical studies the governments have undertaken, with the co-operation of the Project Managementsand the Railways, studies of the basic requirements for safe,,operation.   An initial list of requirements agreed between theappropriate British and French authorities has been directed tothe Companies (Annex  2   ),    (The arrangements.for supervision of safety matters are set out in para 11.19).3.6   During the planning of the project, safety has been keptconstantly in mind.   The structure itself is being designed to have an indefinite life and duplicate and standby power supplies and controlarrangements would be provided for the essential services such asdrainage, ventilation and lighting.   The service tunnel would provideaccess to any part of the system in an emergency.    The track, thesignalling arrangements and auxiliary safety devices would embody themost modern techniques available, consistent with their provenreliability. The system is expected to be even less liable to accidentsthan other major railway linos, with their high safety record,3.7   The risk of, failure or breakdown would be kept to a minimum&quot;by careful design and close inspection and maintenance arrangements; &apos;nevertheless the overriding requirement for the safe evacuation from the tunnel of passengers from a train stranded in the tunnelfor any cause is receiving special attention,   A train which broke downin the Tunnel could be extracted in 90 minutes.

There is no reason to expect that the Tunnel would be any  -more liable to sabotage attempts than other major installations.It would be difficult to cause major permanent damage leading,for instance, to flooding.   Any attempt to blow up or set fireto a train&quot;.in the Tunnel would entail suicidal risks.    In currentcircumstances, however, the possibility of sabotage (either real or.a hoax) could not be wholly excluded, and the fullest possible precautions would therefore be taken in the design ofthe Tunnel installations and in drawing up suitable operatingprocedures.&apos;   The Tunnel could be cleared in 30 minutes and examinedparking space adequate for any likely hold up even if a threat;,b.

In the light of these estimates, tho .designs will bo modified to mitigate any nuisance.    (Thoenvironmental consequences are dealt with in para 8.12). .d.     Alternative forms of fixed link3.11 The reasons for preferring a rail tunnel as against any alternative form of fixed link were set out in Annex 2 to the green Paper, reproduced at Annex 3*    In the view of the Governmentthese remain valid. Onthebasis of such figures as are available and oftho current traffic forecasts, it appears that a bridge with itsmuch larger initial cost would compare unfavourable both financiallyand economically with a tunnel or with continued reliance on sea and air services,   &quot;While the long-term possibility of constructinga bridge need not be ruled out, a bridge would have no advantagesover a tunnel which could possibly justify the.prolonged delay in :provision of a fixed link which selection of a bridge would entail.Capital Costs- -      -        . -3.12   The Green Paper gave an estimate of the Tunnel&apos;s cost as- 366 million at 1972 prices, ; The cost has now been estimated at ij.61]. million at 1973 prices (or  I4.68 million including certainstarting-up costs).

Studies in Phase I have confirmed in general the validity ofthe &quot;reference design&quot; used in 1972.   The only substantial changes made in the course of refining and optimising that design derive from a fuller knowledge of the geology (with the consequentselection of 0. shorter, cheaper, tunnel route); from new traffic   .flow figures  (with a requirement for a larger British terminal):and from a substantial re-appraisal of the design and costs ofthe French terminal.   The real cost increase ( 17 million in 1973prices) represents It..2$ of the 1972 estimate, which was based onterminal provision for the lower traffic flows then envisaged,A breakdown of the main elements of cost is in Annex I4:.3.15   Both the cost figures and the construction programme &quot;towhich they are closely related are based on exceptionally thoroughinvestigations.

THE TUNNEL WOULD BE PROFITABLE .The Government are satisfied that the Tunnel would provide an adequate return on its large initial oost.   That it would boprofitable is not a sufficient reason for building it, but therewould have been no question of supporting it if the studies had shown that it might not be viable.lj.,2       In addition to the joint technical studios referred to in para3.1   above, the Companies, in agreement with the Governments,arranged for major traffic and revenue forecasting and financialstudies to be undertaken during Phase I by independent consultants,Messrs Coopers &amp; Lybrand Associates Limited in Britain and SETEC-Economie in Prance.

Tho views and comments of a number of interested bodies have been obtained.   After full examination of the studies and of the comments expressedthe Government have concluded that the cohtral forecasts representreasonable mid-points to what are necessarily wide ranges ofpossibilities.   Many tests of sensitivity have been performed andon all reasonable assumptions the Tunnel would be viable.If construction costs were 15$ greater, or if gross receiptswere 10$ less than estimated then the return would fall from 17$ to&apos;1 $*    If both of these events occurred together, the return would be 11).$.If it proved possible for the sea. ferries to compete at least for a time on the basis of charges reduced in real terms by hSio rather thanthe 30$ assumed, the return would fall to 1l.j.$.

The value of these benefits are estimated at  18 million ( 16m) a year in &quot;I 980 rising to  33 million ( 26m) in 1990.   For freight travelling through theTunnel, the savings in. charges for the through journey and in time are estimated to ampurit on average to about  1 a ton for roil-on/roll-off traffic and some  2 a ton for container traffic, giving an annual benefit to the UK economy of some  3*3 million in 1980rising to  6.6 million by 1990.Assessment of the forecasts.5.10   The forecasts have been assessed in the light of discussion withthose with specialist knowledge of likely developments in the &quot;withoutTunnel&quot; case, notably the Chamber of Shipping. /The latter take the viewthat revised commercial policies and increased efficiency would enable a smaller fleet to be used in 1980 if no Tunnel were built than the consultants had estimated, and had certain other criticisms of theestimates. If the smaller fleet were practicable, the overall costbenefit return on the Tunnel as compared with it would be reduced bysome ZafoJ,Impact of interruption to services.5.11.     It would be unrealistic to imagine that a transport undertaking of the size of the Channel Tunnel could be entirely free from,interruptions despite the precautions   taken both in design and   ,operation.    These interruptions whether caused by strikes or technical breakdowns are likely to be only of brief duration;any broken down train could be extracted in 90 minutes, and anyincident is likely to affect only one section of our Tunnel, so thatinterruptions to all services are likely to be limited.5.12     The effect of such&apos;interruptions has been examined both    &apos;in terms of the possible financial effect on the tunnel&apos;s operation and also in terms of the economic consequences for the country.

As to the economic effects for tho country as a whole the studies indicate that substantial shipping capacity will remain,even on the very short sea routes, which could carry essential traffic(freight and businessmen) and indeed the bulk of transit traffic inoff peak periods.    The tunnel is not therefore a single vulnerableand monoxjolistic links; rather it is an addition to our range ofcross channel services. &apos; .Balance of Payments.5.1/4     The Government has examined whether the construction of a tunnel would make any significant difference to the balance ofpayments as against continued reliance on air and sea transport.This examination covered the likely sources of finance, the pattern of spending in the constructing and operating periods, and the way in which revenue would be likely to. accrue.   It appears thatthe Tunnel would be unlikely to have any significant net implications for the balance of payments. .CONFIDENTS1tu
BENEFITS FOR BRITISH RAILWAYS6,1     Construction of tho Tunnol would provide substantial benefitsdiagrams in Platos 6    and 7    indicate they intend to take full advantage of tho new opportunities.o6.2     Tho Consultants estimate that some 8-pi passengers, tho majorityfrom London but some from provincial centres, would travel by railto the Continent in the first full year of operation, as compared to 3m or so boat train passengers.    Revenue from passenger traffic toand from the Continent is forecast to be about  28m in 1 981  and  lj.lj.rain 1990 (both in 1973 prices).   A return of 17$ is forecast on the investment in the new high quality rail link on the basis of thoincrease in passenger revenues alono. &apos;6.3     The new facility vhich would bo provided for throughpassenger services would also make possible the development both ofMotorail and freight services.6.1;    It is expected that the Tunnel ferry train service would booperated by the railways under contract.

Overall, tho forecastsimply that in 1980 there would be over 2^0,000 less lorry journeysto and from our ports in 1 9$0 and more than half a million fewerin 1990 with the Tunnel than without it.    The through Motorailservices might take 8,000 cars a week in the peak season in 1981 ,and more thereafter.    Thi3 transformation of traffic to rail wouldrolievo tho roads to our cross-channol ports as a whole of at least a proportion of the increasing traffic.7-2,   On the other hand, there would bo a concentration of traffic on the main route to tho Tunnel terminal.    This will bo provided bythe M20 which will connect with tho main network of strategicroutes via the M25, the Swanley-Dartford link and tho associatedsections completing tho orbital ring round London.    These routeshavo to be built in any event, and are expected to bo completed before the Tunnel is opened.    The additional traffic funnelled intoKent is estimated at some 31+0,000 car journeys and perhaps 100,000 oflorry journeys a year in 1981 .   Most would travel on the 1420, whereit would represent a small proportionate increase in total traffic and would be well within its present design capacity. ,;.
IffiVIROHHKBTAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TERMINAL AND &apos;:RAILWAY LINK0.1     The construction of a tunnel in an area of groat beauty likeSouth-East Kent and of new stretches of railway lino between there and London would cause some damage to the local environment.    Thererauot Inevitably bo differences of opinion on tho overall balanceof environmental.considerations; these differ in their nature, and cannot easily bo compared even one with another, let alone be takenInto a simple equation.    It is the Government1s view, howevor, thatwith the sensitive design and careful planning on which they areInsisting, the local environmental damage should not be so great asto outvieigh tho economic and general environmental benefits already mentioned.    It is, however, important that every effort be made toreduce to a minimum the disruption and inconvenience caused and anylong-term loss of amenity..Tho Tunnel Terminal8,2     Cost and geological considerations require the Tunnel toemorge close to the South-East Kent coast.   After much investigation of possible sites for the various installations needed in this area,tho choice was narrowed to two groups of sites known as the&quot;Sollindge&quot; and the &quot;Cherlton&quot; alternatives.    In 1968, in association-with the Department of the Environment, Kent County Council published a consultation document-&quot;- setting out the advantages and disadvantages of the alternatives and seeking the views of local authorities, local*   The Channel Tunnel - A discussion of terminal requirements on theBritish Side and possible locations for terminal facilities in kent - Kent County Council December 1968.
groups and the general public.    Tho County Council then consideredthe alternatives in tho light of representations received and recommended that the Cheriton proposals wore preferable.    In 1969the Minister of Transport (Mr Richard Marsh) confirmed that if theTunnel were built the various terminal installations should bo inthe locations indicated in that proposal.    The ferry torminal,would be at Choriton,    Any passenger station would be near Saltwoodand any freight yard at Sovington, on the outskirts of Ashford, or at Stanford.    Planning has therefore proceeded on that basis, but it now seems possible to avoid using one of the sites, probably that atSevington, by concentrating all the facilities on the Cheritonterminal site and at Stanford.   No decision has yet been taken on whether or not there should be an international passenger station at Saltwood; this is one of the many matters on which the views ofthe local authorities would be needed as well as a full commercialassessment before any final decision were reached.        . &apos; -8.3     If the Tunnel is to attract a substantial part of the cross-Channel car traffic,   a major terminal in this area is unavoidable.Motor-rail would attract some traffic, but it would be neitherfeasible nor desirable to provide a ferry service for the bulk of.it from further inland.    In the first place, tho extension of theferry gauge line and the operation to inland loading points&apos;of the-very large, fast and frequent trains necessary to accommodate the traffic volumes would be very damaging to the environment.   Moreover,it is not, clear that a site or/sites as well placed for road and railaccess and of sufficient capacity could be found elsewhere    In -practice, however, the substantial extra costs undor any such system would simply force drivers into using the sea ferry crossings.   Thusthere would little if any saving in road traffic to Kent.

The Ferry Terminal

8.4 The latest proposals for the British ferry terminal at Cheriton, on which the views of the Kent County Council are now being sought, are shown at Plates 3 and 4. As planned this, together with the access roads, would occupy an area of about 340 acres bounded by the escarpment to the north, by the proposed M20 motorway on the south and by the villages of Newington and Peene the west.

8.5 Main road access to the terminal would be by sliproads from the proposed M20 motorway passing between Newington and Peene and to the north of Frogholt. Secondary access, including access for local traffic, would be provided via connections to those sliproads from the A20 at Frogholt.

8.6 The terminal layout is based on a continuous flow concept with freight lorries segregated from the remainder of the traffic and kept on the north side of the site to minimise their effect on the environment, particularly the residential areas of Newington and Cheriton. All vehicles entering the site would pass through ticket or toll booths and Customs and Passport Controls before driving to the loading platforms via a bridge over the tracks at the west end. Vehicles off-loading from trains would cross the tracks at the east end of the site and then drive back for processing through compulsory controls on the south side of the centrally sited control buildings. These buildings form part of a single complex located within the railway loop which would provide also for administrative offices and facilities for the benefit of passengers such as refreshment and rest rooms, information bureaux, etc.


8.7   Railway sidings for the &quot;stabling&quot; of ferry rolling stockduring off-peak periods and daily cleaning v/ould be located on ,thesouth side of the Continental main line in partial cutting.    Thi3arrangement makes possible the elimination of an additional high level rail on the south side of Nov/ington which was envisaged earlier.With the removal of this lino and adjustments in railway levels ithas been possible to redesign the major part of the loop line to passunderground in the vicinity of Newington and Peene.    This would be a major improvement, and with extensive and sympathetic landscaping by&quot;earth mounding and tree planting the noise and visual impact of the terminal on its surroundings should be. kept to a minimum.808   Should services through the Tunnel be interrupted, .extra&quot;parkingspace could be made available&apos;within the terminal by temporary.useof- various buffer and landscaped areas.   The total parking capacity,would thus be sufficient for about 6,000 vehicles, or more than two hours peak traffic in one direction,,   In the unlikely event of-a   -prolonged interruption&apos; emergency accommodation could be provided :f ora further 10,000. vehicles on Dibgate Camp,&apos; and arrangements would alsobe&apos;made for warning Tunnel bound traffic of any substantial- holdup&apos;in the Tunnel well before :.it reached the terminal area, and for theuse of the parking spaces attached, to the motorway service areas..CONFIDENTIAL &apos;/\:        .

The Tunnel would benefit, through tho reductions in transportcoats and journey time that it will offer, users of cross-Channelservices generally.    It would&apos; provide economic benefits not only inthe sense that it would show a profit in money terras on .the sums ofmoney invested and provide the services at a lower cost in resources,but also as an addition to Britain&apos;s armoury of links with Europe,9.5   The likely implications of the Tunnel for regional policy havebeen reviewed in the light of the outcome of the. joint * economic o.ndfinancial studies (particularly the forecasts for freight traffic) .and of the Kent Study referred to above.   The main con-clusions are that the Tunnel Would only have a limited potential pull&quot;for manufacturing industry and offices; that the employment it would attract would be unlikely to move &quot;to the assisted areas if theTunnel were not built; that the availability of through rail freightservices to Continental centres would on balance be of positivebenefit to the assisted areas; that diversion of traffic to.theTunnel would have comparatively little effect on ports outside theSouth East and that the employment on construction might be of somenor would they all be so conveniently located for those made redundant.-MMHDEN i IALM   1t
help in dealing with, tho above average unemployment in parts ofKent.    Overall, while it is not possible to quantify the effects ofa Tunnel on particular parts of the UK (since the different regionsare not self-contained economios) effectively all would share, to alosser or- greater extent, in the&apos;benefits the Tunnel could provide.As for other, more local effects, tho indications are that these,if adverse at all, would be unlikely to be sufficiently strong to outweigh tho likely benefits.    Some of these conclusions are set outin more dotail in Annex . -Demand on Construction Resources in the South East9.6   The implications for demand on the construction industry and its resources, nationally and in tho South East, of the combination ofthe Maplin and Channel Tunnel projects  (with their associated trans-port links), and Dockland Redevelopment are kept under regular review.Based on current forecasts these projects (of which the ChannelTunnel is the smallest by a considerable margin) would in totalrepresent in the peak years about. 5$ of the total national expenditureon new works and about 2-$% of tho total national labour forceemployed by contractors.   This demand represents&apos;11^ and        ofexpenditure on new works and contractors&apos; labour respectively in tho- v - . ., ;.;..v&apos;:\. , -     r?&apos;-South East, but many resources are mobile.    It is not&apos; expoctod thatthese demands would generally be critical.    Sensible design andphased construction should enable any difficulties to be avoided ihmeeting demands in the key areas of skilled building craftsmen andbricks &quot;(for both of which the Tunnel will make little demand) and pro--cast concrete elements. .&apos; .      -    ... .&apos;&apos;
9.7 It is not yob certain whether or nob tho 3 tunnels would bolined with pre-cast concrete segments throughout, but ii&apos; so, thetotal amount of sand and gravel aggregate required would be of theorder of 2$ million tonnes over abo;it $ years, compared with annualproduction now of some i].0 million tonnes on South East England, asa whole.    The engineering consultants believe that certain con-   .veniontly located quarries (which are rail served or could deliverto.local rail sidings) could provide much of the aggregate needed andthat, overall, the total potential supply in the South East is sufficient to cover the Channel Tunnel and other major works in thoarea,    Joint working parties of local authorities and tho sand andgravel indirstry have under review the likely demand for these materials up to 1980 and the supply potential in South East England.The Tunnel requirements will be taken into account in their further work on .the identification of possible further sites for future-working.       - &apos;U-3
ikfLIN AND THE TUKNEL -I&apos;10,1     In addition to the roaource implications described above,the Government have also examined othor possible interactions     &apos;      .between Maplin airport and the Channel Tunnel project.10,2   The studies of air traffic to 1985 undertaken by thoCivil Aviation Authority, and the Tunnel forecasts undertaken bythe consiiltants both agree that about      million passenger journeysmight be diverted from air to the Tunnol in 1980/18.    The effects of such&apos;diversion on the London Area traffic are fully explored .in tho CAA report; they are minor in comparison with the inevitable&apos;uncertainties of traffic forecasting. . In terms of numbers of passengers, and on its central forecasts, tho Report (Table 7*23)puts the 1985 air traffic demand at 79 million with a Tunnel and oil million without.   But an annual rate of growth of air trafficonly 1$ greater than predicted could bring the 8J4. million up to^1- million.   Moreover Maplin will serve the domestic, European andTransatlantic markets: the Tunnel will be no substitute herespecialising as it does in a limited range of European destinations.The Tunnel therefore itfill not significantly affect the need for a third London Airport.10o3   The development of Maplin will have no appreciable effect on the traffic forecast for the Tunnel since the Maplin traffic would-otherwise pass through   other&apos; London airports.    Few of tho passengersattracted to the through rail services, for such reasons as cost/convenience and speed compared to air services from the existingairports are likely to be attracted back to air services from Maplin,^Forecasts of Air Traffic and Capacity at Airports in the london area;    Civil Aviation Authority, London May 1973, price il5p*
11.1 Tho proposals for financing and managing the project have been developed by successive administrations over tho past decade. .11.2   Following the report by a Y/orking Group of British and french officials in 196.3&apos;&quot;, the British and French Ministers concerned(Mr Marples and M. Jacquct) announced in February 1961; that thoy had decided to pursue the rail tunnel project and to discuss further the legal and financial problems involved.    Thoy had not then decided whether there was a role for private equity capital.11.3   Following the further survey work, the British and french ministers concerned (Mrs Castle and M. Pisani) were able in 1966to amiounce agreed principles on which the project should be pursued.In brief, tho Tunnel would bo financed by a private Group, whichwould also construct it.   The completed Tunnel would then be handedover to an Anglo-French operating authority which would remunerate,the private Group from the revenues. ; . .        .  -11.il   The next task of tho two Governments was to select, from theprivate sector, interests with whom detailed negotiations mightbegin, leading to the financing and construction of a possible ;tunnel, on terras -acceptable both to themselves and to the twoGovernments.   After a public invitation to tender,.three groupssubmitted proposals.    In tho event none of these proposals was &apos;acceptable to the Governments as they stood, and the three -groups-were given new guidelines and invited to ^supplement their proposalseither singly or, if they wished, in combination,       . :
11,5   A new combined group, formed substantially from the three  : joriginal groups, made revised proposals&apos; in tho latter part of 1970.In March 1971, Mr Peyton, the Minister for Transport Industries, andYi, Charuant, the French Minister of Transport, accepted this Groupfor the further pursuit of the project.  .      .11.6   The Group, whose membership is listed in Annex lit., organised .themselves into the British Channel Tunnel Company Limited and theSociete Francai.se du Tunnel sous la Mancho.   In October 1972agreements (Agreement No 1) were entered into between the Ministers,the Companies and tho Group.   Those covered the period of studies(Phase I) in detail and made outline provision for later phases.11.7-   These later- phases would consist of the initial phase of construction up to Spring 1973&apos; (Phase II), the main constructionworks leading up to expected completion in 1980 (Phase III) and theperiod of operation of the Tunnel thereafter,   Tho arrangements proposed, which are described in the following paragraphs, would be regulated in detail by a major agreement, known as Agreement No 2,&quot;between the Ministers, the Companies and the Group.1.1,8   Agreement No 2 would lay down the details of the financingand management of construction, and the provisional details of the remuneration of the private interests over the period running for50 years from handover of the Tunnel.    Before the main stage of construction v/ere reached final details of the remuneration arrangements,and of any other matters to.be resolved, would have to be-set out ina further agreement, known as Agreement No 3* -      &apos;&quot;  &apos;   - -il-6

The main construction would begin with the  -signature of Agreement No 3 in April 1975; and the Tunnel would bofinished and ready for operation early in 1980.11.11   The Companies would be responsible for raising all. thecapital required, now. estimated at? 8l.j.6 million in. out-turn prices,including interest.    About half the cost of Phase I was private riskinvestment.

The balance of profits aftertaxation would go to the Governments.   Holders of shares or other non-guaranteed securities issued during Phase I and Phase II would,because of the special nature of these investments and tho risksattached to them, be entitled to receive a fixed number of additionalshares when the main,capital is raised in Phase III.Al .13 - The additional share to be allocated to the founding sharo-holders would represent a value .of about  /.(.. 5 million,&quot; in additionthey would get fees for issuing the capital.    The additional riskattached to share subscriptions in Phase II would be covered by theallocation of additional shares to tho value of / 1,6 million/.    The&apos;.remuneration for investors subscribing to the bulk of &quot;the riskmoney to be raised in 1975 cannot finally be determined at this .stage.    It has, however, been agreed that on a notional basis thatthe shares were issued in the /Autumn/ of /T9737? the remuneration,formula referred to in paragraph      above would have to provide       %of gross receipts and     . % of net receipts.   Applied to the figures
of estimated gross profits quoted in paragraph       above, thiswould give a return in tho first full-year of operation of aboutfo after Corporation Tax but before personal income tax.    Thereturn, in 1995) on the same figures, would be       % and in 1 990 .&apos;    %.In money -terms this would mean that the private investors receivedrespectively   million,   million and   million in, ,the three years mentioned.   For these years the Governments would receive   million,   million and   million over and above the servicing of Government guaranteed debt.    In addition, itis intended to make uso of Section 65 of the Companies Act 19li-8 topermit the payment of interest to shareholders out of capital duringthe construction period at a rate which would effectively give them      $7 on their money, before personal, income tax.II.II4.   The effect of those arrangements over the whole period ofyears during which the private capital would be remunerated -is   &apos;.shown in the following table. &apos;.Estimated total profit&quot;    ; Total payments to        Total profit(out-turn prices)     \&apos;       private capital retained by Govts  million   million   million-&apos;     &apos; .   : -: J       : r      7 C I -   :&apos;JMANAGEMENT      .&apos; &apos; /&apos;    &apos; .a.

Under arrangements between the Companies and the

The Authority&apos;s terms of referonco wouldbe to manage the Tunnel as a commercial enterprise in competition with other means of cros3-Channel transport, with a view to socuringthe host possible earnings on capital- employed in the enterprises,without discrimination between road and rail borne traffic.   Thiswould not preclude normal commercial practices, including theadoption of tariff differentials for particular goods and servicesand for peak and off peak periods and of policies designed to maketho Tunnel competitive with other means of crossing tho Channel.The Authority would remunerate tho private capital over /&quot; o7 years in accordance with the formula described in paragraph&apos;      above,and dispose of the residual profits as directed by the Governments.After $0 years all the profits would be available to the&apos;Governments11.17   The organisation would include two National Boards, one british and one French,    The members of the British Board would beappointed by the British Minister and the members of the French&apos;Board by the French Minister.   The members of both Boards would
togothor the Authority.    The Authority would take all thedecisions and, the Boaraa would be its executive arms.    NeitherBoard would be empowered to act other than in accordance withthe decisions of the Authority, which it must obey.    All income andoutgoings resulting from the operation of the Tunnel, includingpaymonts to bo made in roapoct of servicing and amortisation of debt and payments under the remuneration formula to the Companies,would be shared equally between the Boards, and&apos;after taxation onprofits the remaining surplus would bo available to each Government,11,18   Provision would be made for minority representation of theCompanies during the remuneration period, and for their involvementin certain decisions before handover,    Tho level, of the representationduring the remuneration period would depend on the amount of privaterisk capital subscribed.   If tho Companies succeoded in raisingonly 10$ of risk capital, they would be entitled to one seat on each National Board, which would also comprise $ members appointedby the Government,    Thus in such circumstances the Authority would consist of 12 members of whom two were nominated by the Companies.Apart from this the Companies would also have an.effective say intariff policy of the Authority within its commercial terms .of -reference. &apos; , ,11.19   Certain powers of direction over the Authority would be &apos;-:reserved to the two Governments acting jointly. As well as safety,in respect of which the appropriate authorities in this country and france would retain the necessary powers, these cover matters of publicinterest which include non-discrimination between road and rail trafficas described above, national defence and security and safety.

The Authority would make an annual report,and submit audited accounts, to the two Ministers,    These, .togetherwith the associated report and accounts, will bo laid beforeParliament.11,20   There would also be a Consultative Committee to be establishedfrom the date of handover, through which users and other interested parties could make recommendations to tho Authority on matters      . .concerning the operation of the Tunnel.
COMMITMENT. AMD ABANDONMENT12.1    Tho decision to go forward to tho next stago has been taken on the basis that the information now before the Government showsclearly&apos; that the project as a whole is in our national interest.There is, however, no question of our now entering a bindingcommitment to complete the project come what may.12,2   In. accordance with the detailed provisions set out in thoAgreements, any party could abandon tho project at any time, by giving notice; the parties might agree to abandon the project;abandonment would also occur if the parties failed to sign AgreementNo 3 within a prescribed time or if any of the parties failed to implement one of the major obligations it had undertaken&apos;,12,3   The consequences of abandonment would vary according to thecircumstances in which it occurred.   For instance if at the end ofPhase II the parties agreed- that the project was no longer worth-while, or if the Companies themselves.decided to withdraw, then theprivate risk money subscribed to that date would in effect be lost.and the Governments would have to meet their guarantees; the costto HMG would then be of the order of  12-JD15 million.12.1.1.   If   the project were abandoned at a later stage, the same.broad principles would apply as between the Companies and theGovernments.    If, for instance, the parties agreed that unexpected  -difficulties encountered in construction would so increase costs as to make the project no longer worthwhile then the risk moneyalready expended would be lost and the Governments would have tomeet their guarantees.    If the Companies decided to withdraw or ifpoMnnFMTi All &apos;
thoy wore unable to raise the risk money they had undertaken toraise,  tho same would apply; but if the Governments chose toproceed with the project without the Companies certain &quot;buy-back&quot;provisions would operate    If tho Governments chose to abandon the project when tho Companies wished to proceed, they would have notonly to honour tho guarantees, but also to purchase the Companies&apos;interests at a price in excess of their cost calculated on a basissot out in the Agreements.12,5   Under any circumstances the costs falling on the governments as a consequence of any abandonment would be shared equally betweenithe two Governments.

This phase would start when an Anglo-French treaty and agreement No 2 with the private Group had been signed,    This .cannot, however, be done unless and until Parliament pass the&apos; Channel Tunnel (Initial Finance) Bill,; to provide certain limitedfinancial powers.    It has been agreed, that signature should be delayed beyond the originally scheduled dato of 31  July, and thedelay cam if necessary be extended to 15 November.    In order toprovide the maximum opportunity for public discussion before even this limited commitment is assumed, the Government have decided not to.invite Parliament to discuss tho matter before the summerrocess,&quot;but to delay consideration of it until October.   At thesame /time it was felt right that the Government&apos;s position shouldbe made known as soon as possible.       - - -13.2   The main Tunnel works  (Phase III) are not scheduled to startuntil spring 1975*.after the signature of a supplementary AgreementNo 3 between tho Governments and tho Group.

CONFIDENTIALPHASE I TECHNICAL STUDIES AND DESIGNTunnel Alignment1.     Following the extensive geological and geophysical work carried out in1964/5 the French and British Governments set up a Joint Working Party to study the alignment and Isvel of the Tunnel ana recommend a rente.     The routeof the Tunnel agreed by the Working Parly commenced on the British mainlandwith a Tunnel portal located at Holyvvell to the North of Folkestone, crossed the British coast at the Eastern end of Dover Harbour, and thence crossed theChannel to emerge at a portal en the French mainland some 4 kilometres inlandnear Frethun to the South of Calais,     This alignment tecame the basis for aReferenc0 Das ig n.2.     Detailed investigation of the original alignment began again in about March1972,     A feature of the old alignment was that the route had a large loop tothe North of the direct straight line from Folkestone to Sangatte, adding aconsiderable length to the tunnel.     Various alignments were considered andthese indicated that the line should cross the coast somewhere close to theShakespeare Colliery site,2o     If a gradient close to 1 in 100 (to meet train operating requirements) wasto be kept, the line could not be shortened too much.     The amount of coverrequired depends on the nature of the rock, and so it ;;as not possible to makea final decision en the exact route v; it tout further geological investigationclose to the Shakespeare cliff,     Detailed profiles of the sea ted wereavailable from the 1964/65 survey and these were used together with a minimumcover of about 15m to give a tentative alignment for determining the positions of the new boreholes and the area for additional geophysical surveys.4.     The depth of cover required had tc he reviewed as a result of trial boreswhich shewed that weathering penetrated, at least in this region,&apos;to s depth of 53 to 35m of rock.     To achieve this, the line was moved ever, further South,the landward tunnel increased in length and the portal lowered * a few metres._CONFIDENTIAL_
confidential the combined effect cf these moves v;es to keep the tunnel close to the base of the chalk marl over at least the first few kilometres of the seaward, drive.Further borings have confirmed that these revisions achieved their objective in that much sounder chalk lay close to the seabed and they also confirmed thatthere was virtually no penetration of the chalk marl by weathering.5*     A saving in tunnel length of about 2 to 2.5km, could be achieved if this route were followed, saving about  7-3 million.&apos; \   &apos;      &apos;      u        It;       -      /   &quot;The main features of the present design are as follows:a. overall length, portal to portal, 49.26 km.b. maximum gradient 1 in 95*.c.     minimum radius (in plan) 4200 metres.j^sic^ Tunne!L Design and Construct ion k6,     The basic design of the tunnel system consists of three separate tunnelslined throughout their entire length,with two main running tunnels each carrying a single rail track with a central service tunnel lying between and below them(see Plate l),     This third tunnel is intended to be used for access for maintenance, as a refuge for passengers in the case of an accident in the maintunnels, as a ventilation duct, as a drainage channel and as a&apos; protected route for water pumping lines, electrical supply cables and signalling cables.     Itwould be connected to the main tunnel by cross adits every 250 metres:    thesecross connections being isolated from the main tunnels by doors, and the size and frequency of the adits being determined mainly by safety considerations.The adits would provide the access for the passengers and maintenance gangspassing to and from the main tunnels, space for all the signalling and electricalequipment required in the tunnels, and a cross passage for draining water fromthe main tunnels to the service tunnel.     To allow adequate space for these functions with some leeway, a diameter of 4.50 metres would be necessary, andthis has been determined in agreement with the Governments.7- In the running tunnels continuously welded track would be laid on a concreteslab.     The electrical power -would be supplied by a 25 kV overhead line system
tending overf the ferry Ter:*:finals, served id in duplicate from the Britishand French grids and with certain standby facilitio 15 S .The diameter cf themain tunnels has- been the subject of detailed study.     For the purpose ofcosting the system it has been assumed that the tunnels would be of 6.85mdiameter, which would enable them to accomodatc standard deck height ferry wagons ableto carry vehicles of 2(..0a height end double-deck wagons tc carry the peakload of cars,     The final diameter would be determined in the light of surveyscf the dimensions of loaded vehicles which have recently been completed, andan analysis of the economics of providing for larger vehicles by provision ofspecial rolling stock or by enlarging the diameter,8.     The overall design and construction programme for the Project has been carefully considered concurrently with the development of the design.       Theconstruction of. the Terminal Facilities and other above-ground works is notcritical;    the time required for driving the tunnel ana placing the lining isthe over-riding factor controlling the programme. It is clearly essential to organise the tunnelling process carefully.   The construction programme has been developedso as to allow for the difficulties peculiar to the construction of very longsub-aqueous tunnels in soft rock and to reduce to an absolute minimum the risksarising from either water ingress or lack of general ground stability.     an analysis of the tunnelling cycle has indicated that the speed cf placing thelining and the reliability of both the tunnelling machines and the back-upequipment are very important factors in determining the overall programme.     an overall programme has been produced after a careful consideration of all thosefactors.       In preparing it, it became clear that there would be considerablebenefit in gaining practical experience of undersea tunnelling using a boringmachine of a type similar to those to be used for the main tunnelsbefore embarking on construction.   This consideration together with the proposeduse of the Service tunnel as a pilot tunnel from which tc explore and treat theground ahead of the main tunnels led directly to the concept of dividing the&apos;i     4     / &quot;.       .    &quot;- &apos;    i f-     1 *   t .!..A L!

Connections between this road and the A20 would be by means of a specially constructed junction.     Spoil could be hoisted from the tunnel workingsand the greater part conveyed to the old colliery site where it would be loadedinto railway wagons and removed from the area, except insofar as it mightadvantage ou.sly be used locally at points accessible without movement throughresidential areas.Features of the Tunnel Design.    -----.......-------------....... ^------...................-^..^.r,_.a&quot;   Tunnel linings10. Y/hile the chalk marl layer through which the Tunnel would he dug is stable,the nineteenth century workings are still standing unlined, and for most of the distance subject to very little percolation by water, it was decided at an early stage that the tunnels should be lined throughout immediately behind the boringmachines,     Design work has been undertaken by consulting engineers in bothItt to 2 kilometres of service tunne1 to seaward.Only some 20 months later
Britain and Prance.      Theoretical investigations into lining design, supported bylaboratory tests and full scale lining development, have been carried out inorder to refine lining design and reduce cost.     The work done in both countries has resulted in agreement on the design of linings adequate tc provide permanentsupport for the tunnels in the conditions likely to be experienced.

This bridge variant has the aim of reducing the navigational hazard bygoing into tunnel bclov/ the main shipping lanes.   As presented, it would-   ,.--&apos;.&apos;, cost more than a straightforward bridge, largely because of the problems of;..      gradients between the elevated bridge and tho submarine tunnel.   Even-accepting its reduced navigational hazards it would still encounter coot ofthe -other,.--problems that a Bridge would raise, plus some of those Inherent&quot;in an immersed tube (see&apos;paras 3 and 6 below).bo&apos;.

CONFIDENTS!ob j ectives and findi n.gS1.Ob j ec ti vo s- ond Approach &apos;&apos;Scope of studyThis study was commissioned by the Department of the environment and Kent County Council in association with the boroughs of Dover and Folkestone,   to assess the Tunnel&apos;s likelyeconomic and social effects within Kent:    to compare what would happen in the area if the Tunnel were built wii;h what might beexpected to occur in any case,   if there were no Tunnel.The basic consideration has been the employment effects of the Tunnel in the area,  not only in total,  but also inrelation to typos of work and their location.      If some jobswere to be gained and some lost,  thoy might not necessarily bein the same places or for the same kinds of people.      Jobchanges might also lead to population movements,  which wo alsoexamined.These changes in turn might have physical repercussions,such as r.ioro 1 a nd being neoded for the hew act ivities,possilr.tli.ties of congestion and the like.      It was our task to assess these pressures and see what problems might arise -whether,   for example,  the physical capacity of the area near the Tunnel might be exceeded or strained.      But we were notasked to produce a new plan or to make physical planningrecommendations.While most of our work was to be in the part of Kent near to the Tunnel mouth,  we were also asked to look at the effectsa Tunnel might have on any other parts of the County.Study Area^and Tunnel InstallationsFor the reasons just given, we defined a &quot;Study Area&quot; andmost of the. report refers to this Area and its constituent parts,  which are illustrated in Man 2,  while Map I shows thearea in its wider context,      The three sub-divisions we havetaken, within our Study Area are:     the Dover area (tie town andits rural district);    secondly,  Folkestone with Hythe;  andlastly Planning District 28,  which consists of the town ofAshford and a number of rural districts surrounding it.
rxjiwmyEmmLthe tunnel terminal ami all the installations directly related to ii; would full within tho study area.    the. terminalitself,  where vehicles would embark on or disembark from theferry trains,  would be at cheriton,  on the outskirts offolkestone.it. has not been decided whether,  if the tunnel wore built,there would be a passenger station in the area where long-distance trains j such as some of the london-paris expresses,.would stop.     if there were no such station,   the area would hardly be more accessible to;.european capitals than before.but with, the station,   there would be excellent continentalconnections and:this might make the area more attractive foroffices and other activities.    so in assessing the tunnel&apos;simpact we have taken the two alternatives: with an inter-national passenger station in the area;  and without thestation.Gener.a&apos;1 Approachpur approach involved making projections of employment and population for three alternative situations:   (i) without -the tunnel;   (ii) with the tunnel, /without an international   .&apos;passenger rail station;   (iii) with the tunnel and a station.at first the population and basic employment projections were estimated independently.    then the population estimates werereconciled with tho &apos;&quot;central&quot; employment projections.    theresult was a complete set of mutually consistent employment and population projections based on &quot;central&quot; assumptions,-for the study area and its main sub-divisions,  in the three alternative future situations.    we also made &quot;upper&quot; and&quot;lower&quot; as well as &quot;central&quot; estimates for individualemployment categories;  and considered in broad terms thopossible range of variation of total employment the additional land requirements implied by the employ-meat and population projections wore estimated.    physical and other planning constraints in the study area were examined,to the extent necessary to assess the feasibility of the pro--jected development in the very broadest terms.we &quot;nave assumed throughout that central and localgovernment policy regarding development in the study area would remain,  in broad principle,   as at present - not because we believe it necessarily will or should do so,  but  to providea firm basis on which those concerned can consider whether any changes might-be needed.CONFIDENTIAL

There-; xs an estimated peak of 3,500 jobs during theconstruction period before 1980.      But after opening,  employment would remain fairly constant at under 1,000.. Ancillary activities are those closely associated withthe Tunnel and its traffic,  such as Customs, catering and hotels,and transport and distribution systems using or serving thoTunne 1,      Thcy are cxpccted to empIoy about 1,200 pcop3.e afterthe opening,  rising to some 1,800 in 1991.Attracted employment refers to jobs in enterprises thatwill choose the Study.Area in preference to other locations ifthe Tunnel is operating,  though they would not be directlyassociated with it.      Among- ma milaeturers we think some would boIrrpTVienood so,  and we have estimated roughly 2, GOO additionaljobs in 1991.        For offices the key factor will be whether  there

This does not mean that there would be fewerjobs than now:    Dover would still have some 21,000 jobscompared with their present 20,000;    but without the Tunneland with more ferries they would have risen to some 25,000. .There would moreover be a sharp reduction,  of over 1,000 jobs,immediately after the Tunnel opened. . .    iiTota1-employment in the Study Area will therefore,according to these estimates,  rise in any case in the twodecades,  but would rise rather faster with the Tunnel .      its effect would account for between a tenth and a fifth of the total increase by 1991:Employment With and Without the Tunnel 1971-91(Thousands1	197-1	1991	1 v/. o / Thni&apos;e o c- c.\Without Tunnel	&apos; 70	96	-1- 26With Tunnel:-			- &apos;           no station	70	99	-1- 29with station	70	102	-h 32Total population in the Study Area is affected in much the same way, with the growth that would take place in anycase being augmented somewhat if the Tunnel comes:Population With and Without the Tunnel 1971-91Without Tunnel	1971	1991	Increase	1S1	216	-i- 35With Tunno1:			no station	181	225	-h 44with station	181	229	H- 48As regards both employment and population the majorgrowth caused by the Tunnel would be shared between the

Thegreatest uncertainty,  and cause for variation in the estimatesrefers to what may happen in any case in the Study Area (the&quot;Without Tunnel&quot; base estimates).      While there are also someuncertainties about the impact of the Tunnel,   the absoluteeffect of these variations would bo much less than those inthe base figures.      To give an indication of the order of magnitude,  the &quot;Without Tunnel&quot; employment forecast for 1991of 96,000 might we think be subject to maximum variation ofplus or minus 15,000.      With the Tunnel,  the maximum variationmight increase by a further  3,000 or 4,000,   to plus or minus18, 000--19,000 from the central estimate of total with-Tunnelemploymen t.
CONFIDENTIALLand Use -Implfeations in ,Studv AreaGrowth without the Tunnel,  on our central projections,would take up an estimated 2,700 acres of land in the StudyArea between 1973. and 1991.    The corresponding figures forthe maximum,  with-Tunnel with-Siation situation,   is 4,000acres.    Thus the impact of the Tunnel would,  on these estimates,  account for less than one-third of the total increase in laud use over the period.Our broad appraisal of physical and other planningconstrai tits in the Study Area and its immediate vicinityhas shown that there should be no insuperable difficultyin accommodating growth of the order indicated above --even in the with-Tuunel with-St at ion case.    Certain prob--lems would have to be faced - particularly as regards thefurther expansion of Ashford and the development of PoIke-stone - but we have no reason to suppose that they couldnot be tackled successfully.Impact on Remainder.of KentRelatively few specific repercussions of the Tunnelin parts of Kent outside the Study Area were identifiable.Perhaps the most significant effect would be tho building of an. iutnrnnt-i rmnl passenger station somewhere between london and the Study Area,  as a possible alternative to one in the area itself.    If built in or near a town,  such astation could exercise a powerful attraction for office development.    Otherwise the proposed new London-Tunnelrail link would have little lasting impact on Kent,  aftertie  construction period.The Tunnel would tend to increase activity to someextent at the planned fruit and vegetable distribution depot at Paddock Wood,  but would probably have little, net effecton the Inland Clearance Depot at Lenham.    The Tunnel would attract traffic away from the Hover port at Ramsgate, andso have some adverse effect on its employment,  which is however expected to increase in the meaiime.Dover Town Expansion study the estimates quoted earlier make no allowance forthe proposed scheme to expand Dover,  which has been pre-pared by the Borough Council in conjunction with the G.L.C,and is now under consideration by Kent County Council.    Wehave however made separate projections of population and of new.job requirements on the assumption that the scheme would takeplace, which are presented in the report.      The scheme would undoubtedly help to attract industry and other activities to Dover,
CONFIDENTIALbut we have not. attempted to quantify this effect or to relate it to the Channel Tunnel.Availabi1Ity of Alternatlye employment substantial reduction in employment in ports and shipping would occur on the opening of the Tunnel in 1980,as we have mentioned,  and there would be a further moregradual fall over the next three or four years.    Thebulk of the loss would be in Dover.    Some of the reductionmight be achieved by normal wastage,  but there would probablybe many redundancies.in that area.Tho Tunnel and related facilities would create apossibly equal number of now jobs,  but a considerable proportion of these would not be suitable for workersleaving port or shipping employment; moreover,  theirlocation would not be so convenient for many of those whohad previously worked in Dover., Theie would however be.a substantial continuing growth of employment in manufacturing and services in the StudyArea,  though mostly in places other than Dover,    Inaddition,  vacancies would continually arise throughoutthe employment structure, through normal turnover.The r of ore,  it would seem probable that most of thosemade redundant could eventually find suitable alternative employment,  though possibly at the expense of a longerjourney to work.    Nevertheless,  it is clear that there could be a short-term adjustment problem.Policy ImplicationsOur study has not revealed any inevitable consequences of the Tunnel that would require a radical change in centralor local government policies towards the Study Area.    Themost likely requirement is some sort of contingency plan in case a short-term problem arises from redundancies inthe port and shipping industries,  on tho Tunnel&apos;s opening.However,  as we have said, our projections are subjectto considerable uncertainty,    A revision of policy might therefore be needed,  either to stimulate employment in thearea or parts of it,  or alternatively to constrain develop-meat pressures.Once a decision to build the Tunnel had been made,the authorities&apos; main &quot;room for manoeuvre&quot; would lie in the control of new industrial and office development.
CONFIDENTIALWo have forecast aa appreciable move-ment of industry and offices  to the Study Area,  which would be somewhataccolora ted if the Tunnel were built.      The greater part ofthis movement,  however,  would consist of activities having no overriding need to.be in the Study Area or near theTunnel.      Accordingly,  a policy which restrained some of thenew industrial and office developments would not causesignificant disadvantage to those firms for which alternativelocations of similar merit were available.If,  on the other hand,  the authorities wished  to stimulate development,  the power available to them could also bo used to some effect,  since the Study Area wouldido reasonably,  if not outstandingly,  suitable for a wide range of activities.      However,  tho success of a, policyof stimulation would be more dependent on factors outsidethe authorities&apos;  Immediate control,  such as general conditionsin the economy,New warehousing and distribution development is to someextent less amenable to policy,  partly because fewer Government,controls apply and partly because much of the development would be associated cither with the local community&apos;s needs or with the U.K, --Continental traffic through the Study Area.      Mostof the growth of this type of activity would take place whetheror not the Tunnel is built, although it would be much moreconcentrated in the Ashford and Folkestone areas in the with-Tunncl case.,. -       Our estimates have shown most of the growth talcing placein the Ashford and Folkestone areas,  with some loss of employ-went at    Hover.      This is because we have assumed the continuation of present local policies,  which tend to favourdevelopment in the Ashford area.      However,  if it were sowished,  the powers available to the authorities could to someextent divert hew deve1opmeat,  particularly industrial,  fromother parts of the Study Area towards Dover.
CONFIDENTIALSUMMARY OF FIEDI AGIS AXD CO AO LESIONS1.Summary of illcoiact-lghsOur &quot;contraJ.&quot; projections of employment and population,which were discussed in detail in Chapters 1AI-.IX,   are summarised here in Tables XII.1-4.    Table XII.I shows totalempj oymojit in the Study Area and its three sub-divisions at1971,   1981 and IT 01,   in the alternative without-Tunnel,  witli-Tunnel without -Station and with-Tunnel with-Station cases.The corresponding estimates of total population are shown inTable XI 1.2,     (As explained earlier,   these are not preciselyforecasts,  as their travel to work implicati ons,   thoughpossible,  are not necessarily the most probable.;  nevertheless the estimates are adequate tor tho pur-poses of the presentst udy.)Tables XII.3 and XII,4 summarise the net effects ofthe Tunnel on total employment and population in tho threeareas  (i,e.  thoy show the difference between the with-Tunnelprojections - in both with- and without-Station situations -and the comparable without-Tunnel estimates).    It can beboon that&apos; the Tunnel would stimulate the growth of employ-meat and population over the Study Area as a whole and in planning District 28  (especially Ashford) and the Folkestone/Ilytlio area in particular.    But it would reduce growth ofboth employment and population in the Dover area below the^respective witbout-Tunnel rate   and indeed,   according toour estimates,  would lead to some decline of population from ;the present level.As wo have discussed in earlier chapters,  our estimates are subject to a wide margin of uncertainty.    However,  mostof the possible variation,   in absolute though.not in percent-age terms-,   is attributable to uncertainty about tho overallgrowth that would take place regardless of the Tunnel.    Asthe tables show,   on central estimates only a quarter or  less .of the projected 1971-91 growth in the Study Area is attri-attributable to the Tunnel,   oven in the with-Station case.X &apos; \-    - &apos; . : .        -   A-;-Al-^--A     - &quot; :.   -The estimated gains and losses of employment are summariin Table XII.5.

However ,the attraction of now activities  (in effect,  manufacturing and offices) would lead to a net overall gain in employment.Taking into account    &quot;multiplier&quot; effects on &quot;local serviceemployment,  the positive effect of the Tunnel would be substantial,  especially by 1991,Table XII.5 Gains and Losses in Employment,   StudyArea,   1981 and 1991(^oja9)Employment Category	1981		1991		Withpu t-Station	With-Statio n	without-Station -	With-Stat i on direct	. -i-    640 .	-i-    G50	-f    690	-1-   700Ancillary	-1-1, 180	-!-l, 180	-bl, 610	-l-l, 610Attracted	-l-    800	-1-1, 100	-i-3, 200	-1-5, 200Lost	-1,650	-1,650	-3, 770	-3, 770Multiplier effect&apos;	-f-    500	-I-    500	-i-1, G20	*2, 120Overall net gain	&apos;   -l-l, 570	-1-1, 6 80	-i-3, 3 50	. c   o tm2.        Main Issues Arising1(a)      Aval lability, of alternative employment the two main areas of local concern arising from theTunnel proposal are the effects on employment in the ports and the cross-Channel shipping services,   and the possibleImpact of development generated by the Tunnel on the localenvironment.    The first issue is discussed briefly here,and the second in the  pilowing sub-section.. Our estimates suggest that a reduction of perhaps 1,000-1, 500 jobs in ports and shipping would occur in 1980.    onthe opening of the Tunnel,  and that there would be afurther,   probably -more gradual,   fall over the next three or&quot; four years.     (The loss, compared with the without-TunncJLjy/situation..would be course be more pronounced.    The bulk of theloss would occur in Dover,    Some of tire reduction might ofcourse be achieved by -normal wastage,   but there would pro-bably be many hundreds of redundancies.CONFIDENTIAL
The Tunnel and directly-rela ted facilities would create about S00 new jobs,   but a considerable proportionof these would.not be suitable for workers leaving portor shipping employment; moreover,  their location wouldnot be convenient, lor most of those who had previouslyworked in Dover. . -As we have pointed out in Chapter IX,  there wouldbe a substantial continuing growth of employment in manu-facturing and services in the Study Area,   though mostly in places other- than Dover.    In addition,  vacancies wouldconstantly arise throughout the employment structure,   throughnormal turnover.Therefore,   it would seem probable that most of thosemade redundant could eventually find suitable alternative employment,   though possibly at the expense of a longerjourney to work.    However,   it is clear that there could bea,  possibly acute,   short-term adjustment problem.A further problem might arise in the Dover area throughthe partial or total closure of the nearby coal mines.    Inour projections we have assumed they remain open.    If this assumption were to prove incorrect,  the need for new employ-in or near Dover could be greater than we have indicated.&apos;The Dover town expansion scheme which is now beingconsidered could,   if adopted,  attract more new industrial   .and other employment.    It would also,   of.course,   involveexpanding the working population of the area.    Clearly,   in planning the future balance of employment and population growth,   it would be necessary to take account of the lossof jobs by existing residents,  on account of the Tunnelif it proceeds,  and possibly in coalmining. -A&quot;-   v A,-A.A,.;----- &apos;&apos;.    -- y      t(b)    &apos;Development pressure,As we have shown in Chapter IX,  the greater part ofthe increase in land usage in the Study Area over the nexttwenty years or so would be attributable to factors otherthan the Tunnel,   even if both the Tunnel and an internationalrail passenger station were built in the area.    A broadexamination of the area has revealed no major constraintsthat would suggest that the projected growth,  at least on &apos;:&quot;central&quot; assumptions,   could not be accommodated; althoughthe questions to what extent,   in what manner and where thedevelopment could take place are of course a matter for future appraisal by the planning authority.This is not to say that no serious planning problem^would be faced; but we have no reason to suppose that theycould not be solved,        -i
3.Policy Imp TicatTonsOur study has not revealed any inevitable consequences of the Tunnel that would require a radical change in centralor local government policies towards the Study Area.    Themost likely requirement is some sort of contingency plan in case a short--term problem varises from redundancies intho port and shipping industries,  on the Tunnel&apos;s opening.However,   as we have said,  our projections are subjectto considerable uncertainty,  even more than most long-termforecasts because of the lack of precedents.    A revisionof policy might therefore be needed,   either to stimulateemployment in the area or parts of it,  or alternatively to   .constrain development pressures;   As we have said in ..earlierchapters,   the powers available to tho authorities are capableof a major influence on prospective development;  and theywould also possess considerable &quot;room for manoeuvre&quot;,  toencourage or restrain industrial and other growth without,causing deleterious,economic effects to the activitiesconcerned.
CONFIDENTAnnex 13. REGIONAL EXPLICATIONS1.    The conclusions reached by Economic Consultants Ltd in their.study of theTunnel&apos;s likely economic and social impact on Kent have wider regional implications.They indicate that it is unlikely that the Tunnel would attract employment opportunities away from the assisted regions to the South East; developmentattributable to the Tunnel is likely to be comparatively small and firms seeking a location in South. Bast Kent for industry or offices would not be expected to havebeen interested in establishing themselves in an assisted area had the decisionbeen not to proceed with the Tunnel.Effects on existing industry in the regions2,    For suitable goods the Tunnel would provide a through rail route to theContinent avoiding the need for trans-shipment, and thus saving time and money.It would be likely to he particularly attractive for container traffic, and certainfull train-load movements.   It should also be cheaper and more reliable than existingroutes; it is important to stress the difference not just of degree but of kind whicha continuous land link with Europe would provide for rail traffic.   Since the tunnel would link rail (and road) networks of this country with those through the Continent,these benefits would be available to the whole country, and those of rail-haul, overeconomic distances could be of particular&apos; benefit to places beyond London.   the through rail services likely to be provided a.re set out in paragraph of this paper; they would of course be expanded if demand required,3.    The Tunnel would also link Britain&apos;s road system with the of the continent.Whether or not the Tunnel is built the M20 will be needed, as the traffic forecastsclearly show.   That road would link the ferry terminal at Cheriton with the M25 andthe rest of the orb ital route round London which is planned, for completion by 1930,and thence to the national trunk&apos; road system.4.    The benefits of &quot;better&quot; through transport, are not one way only, however,   Y/hileeffectively &quot;bringing Scotland closer&quot; to, say, Milan, they would also bring Milan,closer to Scotland.   The Tunnel would put London at the same &quot;distance&quot; from say Cologneas it is from Glasgow, thus, it may be argued, working to the deteriment of the Glasgowmanufacturer for the London market against his German competitor.   The remedy for this,
however, is not to abandon the Tunnel, hut - if the argument is valid - to tackleGlasgow&apos;s problems directly,Elfcota on existing facilities ;M5/ Ho one would have to use the Tunnel,, nor would it have an enforced or naturalmonopoly.   Industrial concerns would he free to choose, on the merits of the serviceoffered, whether to use it or to continue to use their previous mode.   It is true,however, that to a lesser or greater extent traffic at present using existing ports and routes would transfer to the Tunnel route,   &quot;Estimates of diversion from the ports by class of traffic are shown in the attached tables,   Table 1 provides a broadindication of the extent to which freight would be diverted.   Apart from Dover/Folkestone and Newhaven the amount lost to other poxvts would be a very sma.llproportion of their overall freight traffic in 1980; all the Scottish ports taken together would lose only 20,000 tons.   Estimates for diversion in 1990 are of thesame order.   Tables 2 and 3, though perhaps of less regional relevance, indicate the extent to which passengers and accompanied cars would be diverted to the Tunnel,There would be some 7 years between a decision to go ahead with the Tunnel and its completion so that adjustments could be reasonably planned.Tourism6,   Among wider questions of regional prosperity, tourism should be considered,because regional earnings from tourism would be changed if the Tunnel had amarked effect on the volume and distribution of incoming tourists,   The studiesnow available suggest however that;a, the Tunnel itself would generate only a marginal addition tothe total of &quot;Continental leisure&quot; traffic, which is, however,expected to grow rapifly (10$ p.a, to I9S0, 1980-1990)5 and b, there would be no special pull to areas near the Tunnel portal.Effect on Employment during construction7.1   The Tunnel and ancillary facilities during the construction period would generate employment needed for the works.        A brief survey undertaken by the Highways Economic Unit in 1971 indicated that the bulk of highwayconstruction labour was locally recruited.

CONFIDE&quot;local&quot; construction labour fores at about 1,400 in 1570;    some might comefrom the rundown in the construction force at Dungeness B by 1975? but someunemployed labour in the area might be absorbed.     At present unemploymentexists above the national average in 6 of the 14 travel to work areas in kent.     As this is long-standing and unresponsive to the general level ofeconomic activity in the economy as a whole, a project of this sort shouldbe directly beneficial in the short term and make a real contribution toprosperity in these areas.     It is unlikely that any insoluble problemswouldarise out of this,     It is not envisaged that the construction of theTunnel would have any adverse effect on employment in the assisted areas;that is to say it does not at present appear on the evidence available thatthe Tunnel construction will take place at the expense of specifically&quot;regional&quot; projects due to the volume of staff and materials that it would absorb;   indeed it seems possible that demands on, for instance, the heavyengineering industry might well stimulate potentially desirable activity in some regions, in particular the requirement for a large tonnage of rails.Arrangements have been made to ensure that the industries concerned arealerted to the potential opportunities...

RESTRICTEDCiiaiiiiel iimnci (initial finance)EXPLANATORY AND FINANCIAL memorandum the purpose of Ibis Bill is lo provide finance for preliminary work on the Channel Tunnel. The project is to be financedpartly by private capital and partly by loans guaranteed by theUnited Kingdom and French Governments. The respectiveliabilities of the two Governments will be regulated by arrange-,;meats between them to which reference is made in clause 1(3) ofthe Bill.Under clause l(l)(a) hie Treasury can guarantee loans raised to finance work already done or to be done during an initial period defined in clause 2(1) as a period ending on 31st May1975 or such later date as may be appointed by order of theSecretary of State. Clause 1(2) sets a limit of  30 million on theamounts borrowed in relation to which the Treasury can givethese guarantees.Under clause /(/)(/&apos;) the Treasury can contribute towards meeting corresponding guarantees given by or on behalf of theFrench Government. The amount of these payments will, by clause 7(5), depend upon the arrangements between the twoGovernments but cannot exceed  15 million in respect ofprincipal.Clause ](l)(c) makes provision for meeting any expenditure incurred in connection with the carrying out of further studieson the project and any expenditure required in the event of theabandonment of the work during the initial period.Financial effects of the Bill- &quot; , &apos; &quot;      .      :.&apos;&quot;&quot;VThe limit of  30 million on the loans which can be guaranteed by the Treasury and consequently on the contingent liability ofthe Consolidated Fund is high enough to cover the obligations ofboth the Governments so far as repayment of principal is con-cerncd. But it is envisaged that the net liability of the UnitedKingdom Government (and of that Fund) will be only  15 million as a result of the limit of that amount imposed by clause 1(3) onthe Treasury^s contributions to meet French guarantees and theprovision in clause 1(4) for appropriating the contribution fromthe French Government under the arrangements referred to inthe event of the Treasury being required to meet guarantees on149-5 A 45/3
sums borrowed in excess of that amount. There is no limit onthe expenditure to be met out of voles under clause l(l)(c).Expenditure in connection with further studies is likely to be small and expenditure required in the event of abandonmentcannot be precisely, estimated.Effects of the Bill on public service manpower-Any effects of the Bill on civil service manpower arc expectedto be ncelieible.:.&apos;-.T- V ;   W&apos;:M : ; MV WJT/,,; :     ,
