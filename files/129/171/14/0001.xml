DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S government cp(73) 94 COPY NO1 October 1973CABINETTHE MAPLIN PROJECT: HANDLINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment, On 10 September I circulated a paper on the timing and presentation of the Maplin project (CP(73) 89)s and the Secretary of State for Defencecirculated a paper on the relocation of defence facilities fromShoeburyness (CP(73) 90),2.        At a meetingon 11 September the Prime Minister agreedthat, in announcing the decision to go ahead with the Channel Tunnel,it would be desirable for us to make it clear that there had been someslippage in the timetable for the Maplin project, with the result that the phasing of expenditure on Maplin and the Channel Tunnel would now be such that the two projects together would not put an unacceptable strain on resources.    In a speech on 12 September I accordingly said:&quot;The extent to which they /Maplin and the Channel Tunnel/ makea call on national expenditure and resources must not be exaggerated,particularly as the workload is spread over so many years.    It is now clear that it will not in any way be possible to open the Maplin airportbefore 1982.    Accordingly the public expenditure involved and the callon resources will build up very gradually, especially in the early years&quot;,3.        We are, therefore, now publicly committed to a 1982 opening date as a target, and this date is being used in the work which will form the basisof the White Paper which Clause 2(9) of the Maplin Development Bill nowrequires us to produce.4,        Conclusion 10(c) in my previous paper (CP(73) 89) has therefore beenovertaken, but I still seek my colleagues agreement to the other conclusionsset out in paragraph 10.    In particular, the need for an early decision onTain has now become even stronger,,    An early announcement for firm plans for relocating the defence facilities from Shoeburyness is now, in my view,essential to the credibility of the Maplin project for the following reasons:
a,        A timetable for the project leading to a 1982 opening date iscredible only if a decision on the relocation of the defence facilities is taken very soon.    Commentators will naturally expect the 1982opening date to be more realistic than the target of 1980 which weset before we had been able to study all the aspects of the project in detail;  and we may now expect pressure to provide more detailed information about the timetable for the project9    but unless we are able to present a timetable which is based on firm decisions on the defence relocation it will very soon become clearthat the 1982 date is no more realistic than the 1980 one, 1h.        The announcement of a 1982 opening date for the airport hasnaturally been interpreted by the opponents of the project as a deliberate policy decision to give the Channel Tunnel priority over Maplin, and as the first step towards complete cancellation of the Maplin project.    Early announcements of difficult decisions would be the best evidence of our intention to proceed.c. Our own supporters who represent constituencies affected bynoise from the existing London airports are expressing concern about the 1982 opening date.    Clear evidence of action towardsachieving the 1982 date would present them with the best possiblereassurance.5.        The need to maintain the credibility of the 1982 date, and thus of the project as a whole, does not, of course, remove the need to look again atthe desirable opening date in our current study of the project, as proposedin paragraphs 2 and 3 of my earlier paper.    The phasing of expenditure onthe project within this time scale may also need to be considered in thecurrent public expenditure exercise.    But now that the 1982 date has been mentioned we cannot afford to give public indications of any furtherslippage, unless and until we are ready to announce a firm date onthe basis of a thorough review of all the evidence,6,        I therefore seek my colleagues agreement to the remainingconclusions set out in paragraph 10 of CP(73) 89.G r department of the environment October 19732
