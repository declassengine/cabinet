DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73)96 COPY NO    g ijj3 October 1973CABINETTHE LAND HOARDING CHARGEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the EnvironmentI \t\ I V &apos;1.        The Prime Minister has agreed that this subject should bediscussed in the context of Stage 3 of  the counter-inflation programme.I have come to the conclusion that it would now be a mistake to continue with the land hoarding charge which we announced in the White Paper(Cmnd 5280) in April.2.        When we decided on the charge, planning permissions for housing in the South East were being granted much faster than they werebeing used and we suspected that many owners were hoarding land withsuch permission for speculative purposes.    Since then the situation has changed radically.    Our measures to increase the supply of land are having a favourable effect on the market.    Land prices are stabilisingand the market may well become weaker still.    Thus there is no longer any advantage in hoarding land with planning permission. ,3.        Moreover there is some reason to believe that the hoarders ofland which already has permission have been putting it on the market.It is also becoming clear that most of the owners with planning permissionwho have been slow to develop are builders using the land as working stockand institutions such as schools who obtained planning permission merely to establish a value for the land.    The only national survey since Aprilwhich covered land hoarding (by the Royal Institution of CharteredSurveyors) found no concrete evidence that land with planning permissionwas being hoarded on any significant scale.    Nor have we discovered anysuch evidence.4.        Thus if we proceed with the charge, we shall be unable to justify iteither in Parliament or outside, not least to many of our supporters whawill be impressed by the arguments of the local authorities, the house-builders and the landowners, all of whom oppose the scheme on the nowirrefutable grounds that it is burdensome for local authorities and privateCitizens without being either necessary or effective.    Detailed examination and discussions with outside bodies (see Annex) show that the scheme willhave to be much more complex and elaborate than had been previouslythought.    The charge falls on persons who fail to complete development iwithin a prescribed period.    We shall need to cater for some 50 situationsin which the period can reasonably be extended and 8 situations whereappeal must be allowed.1
5.        I believe that we would be much more embarrassed, and for much longer, if we went on with the charge than if we abandoned it.    If it isto be abandoned, we can point to the changing trend in land prices which our measures have helped to bring about.    In addition we would make itclear that we would in future support compulsory purchase by localauthorities of any housing land which ought to be developed but wasbeing hoarded.    Authorities can use these powers to stop the hoardingof land without planning permission as well as of land with it, whereas the land hoarding charge applies only to the latter.G r department of the Environment3 October 19732
