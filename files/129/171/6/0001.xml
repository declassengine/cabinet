confidential the BRITISH STEEL corporation the GOVERNMENT&apos;S REPLY TO THE FIRST REPORT FROM THE SELECTCOMMITTEE&quot; ON NATIONALISED Il\T)Wfi^ST&quot;SESSION 1972/7 5IntroductionThe steel industry is of fundamental importance to theindustrial life of this country and the nationalisation of the major part of it presented the British Steel Corporation (BSC)and the Government with new and weighty problems.     TheSelect Committee&apos;s inquiry five years after nationalisationwas timely, and the Government and BSC welcome its report,which makes a helpful contribution to thinking on some important aspects of the activities of BSC and the relationship between it and the Government.2.     The Report is based on evidence heard by the Committeebetween 18 April and 23 October 1972.     As the Report itselfrecognises, it has to some extent been overtaken by events.Two developments in particular since the inquiry are important.3.     The first is the Governmenfs approval of a ten-yearstrategy for the modernisation and expansion of steel production by BSC, announced by the Secretary of State for trade and Industry on 21 December 1972.     Details were published in a White Paper.    (Cmnd 5226   February 1973)-
4.     This agreement on strategy was an important development for relations between BSC and the Government.   It marked the culmination of the fundamental review which the Governmenthad initiated in March 1971-    Together with thejsetting of a financial objective in August 1972, it put BSC in a positionto concentrate on the. task of achieving agreed objectives with full Government backing.   Moreover it came at a time when BSChad established corporate planning procedures, on the basis ofwhich agreement had been reached;on the supply of information to the Government and on procedures for investment approval and financial reporting.     These arrangements are now operating smoothly and the main difficulties to which theCommittee drew attention are no longer a factor.5.     The second important development since the Committee^inquiry is United Kingdom entry into the european communities.     BSC now operates in a wider and more competitive market in which, though large, it is farfrom a monopoly supplier of any product .     The need forBSC to hold its own in this environment must affect the government&apos;s relations with it.     Moreover, our accession to the Treaty of Paris requires specific changes in thatrelationship.     The Government is no longer free to give
special financial assistance and BSC must operate commerciallyand earn a- proper return on its capital.     In addition theGovernment is precluded from controlling the prices of products covered hy the Treaty;    since,i.the ending ofPhase I of the counter-inflation measures BSC has- &apos;v&apos;:\ .... ^       II   &apos; ,,-.1/ - -been free to determine its own prices for those productswithin the ECSC pricing system.     It will of course take into account, as any major industrial concern would, theimportance to itself and the country of the success of measures to combat inflation.6.     Ministerial responsibility for nationalised industriescan create difficult situations, because of the scope forconflict between the commercial interests of the industryand the wider public interest and because there cannot be acomplete separation of these interests.     As the Committeerecognises, the responsibilities of the Board and of theDepartment interact, and this has caused special difficulty with the steel industry, both because nationalisation was sorecent and because it is a manufacturing industry which hasto operate in direct competition with a private sector in the uk and also in world competition.     The Government and BSCagree, however, with the Committee&apos;s comment that they are in partnership with a common objective and that a sense of thispartnership should permeate their relationships at all levels.Both are anxious to work to this end, and they believe that,
CONFIDENTIALparticularly in view of the developments mentionedabove,   the earlier difficulties have largely been overcomeand that relations between them have now been put on to asatisfactory basis.Summary of Recommendations and Government reply7.     The following paragraphs reply to the Committee&apos;srecommendations as summarised in the final section of theReport.&apos;&apos; &quot;&quot;  &apos;      1 - :     &apos;   &apos; i \\\ - iiRecommendation 1: The Treasury should review the operationof public dividend capital (pdc) &quot;8.     The Committee argues that an analogy between pdc andequity is misleading because of the differences betweennationalised and private industry, and suggests that itis a fundamental weakness of pdc that it is vulnerable tppolitical erosion and that it offers &quot;an easy way out&quot;of difficulties to governments and industries.9.     The Government agrees that the analogy between pdcand equity cannot be taken too far, but does not consider thatthe case for using pdc rests on such an analogy.     the justification for the use of pdc derives from the fact thatit is undesirable that a nationalised industry, efficientlyrun and charging prices at a proper level over the lengthof the relevant trade cycle, should find itself in deficitduring part of that cycle because all its external capital
is in fixed-interest debt;   not only would such deficitstend to depress managerial morale, but they might also tendto distort policy choices.     These arguments are the strongerif the industry&apos;s competitors, with which its results are- &quot; &apos;        &apos; ; h    III;   // iinaturally compared, have a different structure.     BSC&quot; &apos;. ; / &apos;:&apos;-&apos;&quot;v&quot;:&apos;-&quot;Titself attaches great importance to the continuation of pdcfor a manufacturing business, particularly one operating inthe European and wider international context, and one whichis especially susceptible to fluctuating demand and thereforeprofits over the trade cycle.10.    In short, the differences between pdc and equityhave always been recognised, and their existence is noargument for abolishing pdc.11.   The Committee&apos;s main objection to pdc is that industrieswith it are, in their view, vulnerable to political pressure.The Government accepts that this may appear to be so unless there is a clear standard by which to judge an industry&apos;sperformance;   and it therefore considers it essential thata nationalised industry with pdc should also have a financial objective requiring an adequate rate of return on all its capital.   BSC has such a financial objective; andan objective for the British Airways Board is under discussionwith them.   Moreover as regards prices, about which theCommittee was particularly concerned, BSC is now subject tothe Treaty of Paris for most of its products (see paragraph 5above). CONFIDENTIAL
12.   For these reasons, having reviewed the operation ofpdc and carefully considered the Committee&apos;s comments, theGovernment has reached the conclusion that its use inappropriate cases remains desirable, and that the guidingconsideration should continue to be that the industry isbasically profitable but subject to fluctuating returns.It is proposed to continue the use of pdc in the case ofBSC.Recommendation 2;   The Department of Trade and Industry should review the resources available to it, should the Minister notbe satisfied with the advice given by the Corporation on technical or commercial matters, and take steps to repair anypotential deficiencies13.   The Department has reviewed its resources, bearing inmind the Committee&apos;s view (paragraph 39) that the minister should be able to &quot;call on an independent technical and commercial assessment&quot; of proposals put forward by theCorporation &quot;if he is in real doubt&quot;, and that theDepartment should be able either to provide or to commissionsuch advice.14.   The Department&apos;s Iron and Steel Division, which is thefocal point for its responsibilities towards the steel industryand co-ordinates advice to the Minister on such matters, hasaccess to a wide range of specialist advice within theDepartment:   engineers and scientists in the EnergyTechnology Division, statisticians and economists in the
Economics and Statistics Division, accountants in theAccountancy Services Division, and the Department1sIndustrial Advisers.   And in April this year the ManagementPlanning Advisory Unit was established by the Department toassist in work on corporate planning, including investment programmes.   The specialist advisers include people with experience in the steel industry, and in general are able tobring to &quot;bear a wide range of experience of dealing with similar problems in other industries.   The Department also has access to outside expert advice in the Advisory Committeeon Research and Development, which advises the Minister on BSCsannual research and development programme.15*   Consideration is now being given to some strengthening of thestaff in the Economics and Statistics Division and in theManagement Planning Advisory Unit.   Subject to that, theDepartment is satisfied that these resources are adequate for advising the Minister in normal circumstances, for example toenable him to make an informed critical scrutiny of BSC1s annualinvestment programme.   When a more far-reaching independentassessment is required, the Department&apos;s resources can be supplemented by employing consultants, as was done during therecent fundamental review of bsc&apos;s long-term development.     Itis important that the Minister should have the right to seeksuch advice, but the Government fully agrees with theCommittee&apos;s view that this right should be used sparingly.
Recommendation        The Corporation should take whatever steps are in its power to encourage the TUG Steel Committee to widenits scope- to include consultation on certain wages questions.16.   BSC has encouraged the development of the TUC SteelI    &apos;Industry Consultative Committee as a joint negotiating body and would welcome the widening of this role to cover wagesmatters.     It is of course for the trades unions concerned to decide how they should organise themselves for thispurpose.Recommendation 4:   The Worker Director Scheme should be encouraged to develop further.17.   The experimental introduction of the employee Directorscheme proved successful and the Corporation has now established it on a permanent basis with the agreement ofthe trades unions.     There are altogether 16 employeeDirectors in the Corporations 6 product Divisions.     It isthe Corporation&apos;s view that further development of thisscheme would be desirable, and it is considering thenecessary steps to this end.Recommendation 5:   The Minister and the TUC Steel Committeeshould meet regularly.18.   The Government attaches importance to close consultationwith the trades unions, especially in view of the many problems arising from the necessary closure of obsolete plantin the steel industry.     The TUC Steel Committee is valuableas a central point of contact representing workers in the
industry, and the Minister for Industry has had usefuldiscussions with the Committee.     His meetings with theCommittee.have now been put on a regular basis.Recommendation 6: The Department should consider how best to foster a true partnership with the Corporation.I19.   The Government fully accepts the importance of goodunderstanding and close,working relationships between theDepartment and BSC in the national interest.     Despite theearlier difficulties on which the Committee commented a close working relationship has been achieved and this hasbeen improved by the settlement of major issues.     a regular framework of formal consultation has been established,and there is frequent contact and ready co-operation between officials of the Department and the Corporation.     Theirrespective responsibilities have been clarified and codified,enabling each side to see its own responsibilities moredistinctly in the context of those of the other, and tounderstand the way in which its exercise of thoseresponsibilities may impinge on the interests of the other.Against this background, the Corporation and the Departmentintend to maintain the close relationship now existing between them, in the spirit of partnership which theCommittee urges, so as to ensure a full mutual understandingthrough a sense of common purpose.     They are confident that both personal and corporate relations are now good.
