THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 8910 September 1973TIMING AND PRESENTATION OF THE MAPLIN PROJECTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the EnvironmentI. The remaining stages of the Maplin Development Bill - report and Third Reading in the Lords and Commons consideration of lords amendments - are due to be taken in October.    There should be nodifficulty about securing a Third Reading in the Lords.    The only majorpoints likely to arise on Commons consideration are the amendments to clause 2 providing that reclamation cannot be started until the Secretaryof State makes a Statutory Instrument subject to annulment; and that theOrder should not be made until a report has been laid before Parliamentfollowing consultation with at least the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA),the British Airports Authority (BAA), the National Ports Council (NPC),the Port of London Authority (PLA) and the Maplin development authority (MDA).2.        Work has now been put in hand towards producing a report,including a re-examination of the estimates of air traffic growth;  newstudies of the noise implications at existing airports of the introductionof quieter aircraft;  and an examination of the consequences of not havingMaplin.    This last involves examining the cost, environmental and otherimplications of greatly extended use of existing airports (capital invest-ment in airport facilities, improved access, extra housing and urbanfacilities, etc).    The study will also review the possibilities of greater use of regional airports.    The results should be available for our consideration early in the New Year.    We should also by then have further information about the viability of   the seaport proposals.3. This report will give us an opportunity to have a thorough reviewof the whole project and will enable us to consider the phasing of this project with that of others, notably the Channel Tunnel, which make substantial demands on resources around the end of this decade.    Iremain convinced that we were right to commit ourselves to Maplin,notwithstanding that the report may indicate that some delay in its completion would not be unacceptable, especially if the Channel Tunnelis open by 1980.    In the Commons Debate on the new Clause, I would propose to make clear that we were conducting a thorough review andthat there would be no commitment either to the commencement of sub-stantiLal work on the project or to the precise timetable for completion ofits elements until Parliament had had an opportunity to consider thereport.copy NO67CABINET
4. The Official Committee^ report on the review of the third london Airport construction timetable, which is annexed to this paper,concluded that spring 1982 was the earliest practicable opening date fora one-runway airport at Maplin;  and that was dependant upon our taking a decision now about using Tain for re-location purposes.    If thatdecision is not taken now, then the earliest date becomes summer 1983.5.        It is for consideration whether we should announce that we are planning on the basis of 1982 or 1983 rather than continue to refer to&quot;the early 1980&apos;s&quot;.    For my part I feel we should be wise to defer adecision about precise timing until we have had an opportunity toappraise the results of the review.    There is a need, however, in ourconsultation with the various bodies to make an assumption for planning purposes about the timetable, including the opening date.    I would therefore like my colleagues&apos; agreement to taking spring 1982 as theopening date, purely for planning purposes and in my view we should keep open the possibility of a spring 1982 opening as our ultimate targetas well as a planning assumption.    This implies taking a firm decision about Tain now, as recommended by the Secretary of State for Defence(CP(73) 90).    In view of the risk of leak, it would, I think, be desirableto make clear publicly that we are adopting this date and its limitedsignificance.6.        Once we have got the Bill, I think, we should defer any furthermajor public presentation until we know the results of the studies.    Weshould, however, announce conclusions on the access routes and newtown in the autumn, following the present round of public participation,aO as to avoid unnecessary blight.    The publication of a &quot;White Papergiving our conclusions on the studies and consultations will enable us toensure that public consideration will be on an informed and authoritativebasis, provided that opportunity is afforded for Parliamentary debatefairly soon after publication.7.        Set out below are total forecast expenditures (at 1973 prices) forwhich the Department of the Environment would be responsible, on theba^is of alternative opening dates.    The details are in Annexes I and 2.They do not include estimates of the phasing of expenditure on work forwhich the BAA and CAA would be responsible since their authorities&apos;estimates are still based on a 1980 opening date.    The implication of the choice of a 1982 planning date for the Maplin figares in this year&apos;s public expenditure White Paper will need separate consideration.Opening Date        1973/74     1974/75      1975/76      1976/77      1977/781980	 m	8. 6	40. 2	59. 5	66. 1	109. 11982	 m	5. 3	30. 9	47. 1	59. 8	81. 51983	 m	5. 3	29.4	41.6	49. 5	67. 92
Some further adjustment of expenditure as between one year and another in the forecast period, on the alternative bases of opening in 1982 and1983, would be possible, depending on a more detailed review of theprogramme for the whole project.

. , CABINETOFFICIAL COMMITTEE ON THE THIRD LONDON AIRPORTREVIEW OE THIRD LONDON AIRPORT CONSTRUCTION TIMETABLENote by the Chairman of the Official CommitteeINTRODUCTION1      In March 1973 the Official Committee reported to TA that the MODwithdrawal programme was not compatible with the publicly declaredGovernment intention to have the airport open for 1980.   A detailed network analysis had confirmed, on the assumption that there would be anearly resolution of the relocation problems, that the forecast openingdate of the chosen sight would be spring 1981.    It was then indicated,however, that the withdrawal plan on which that estimate was based was out-dated and clearly optimistic;    the view was expressed that theopening date was slipping back to 1982 or later,   Ministers then decided that, although it might be necessary to review the declared aim off opening the airport in 1980 later in the year, it should remain theGovernment&apos;s intention to achieve the earliest possible opening date,MOD WITHDRAWAL2     Planning clearances for ESKMEALS and TY CROES have still not beengiven.   But the main problem to be solved is the use of a site at TAINfor the relocation of the main research and development facilitiesoMinisters have decided that they will await public reaction to therecommendation about relocation of the Shoeburyness facilities made inthe report of the committee on Defence Lands, published, on 6 July 1973*In the light of these reactions the Government will decide whether torelocate the research and development work at TAIN.3 It is considered, unlikely that a further independent assessment,either by an Ad Hoc or by a Planning Inquiry Commission would provide
a better &quot;basis for deciding on the relocation of the Shoeburynessfacilities than the recommendations of the Nugent Committee.    Bothwould entail unacceptable additional delays:    an Ad Hoc Panel would add twelve months and a Planning Inquiry Commission up to eighteen months further delay.    Thus a further independent inquiry would havethe effect of delaying the opening of the airport either to thebeginning or to the summer of 1983.   If, however, the Government wereto base their conclusions on the recommendations of the NugentCommittee, following public reaction to them, a decision about reloca-tion could be taken by November or December 1973-   Provided thatarrangements for MOD withdrawal could then be suitably phased, theeffect would be to delay the opening of the airport a further eightto ten months from that previously declared as the optimum, that is toa time between December 1981 and February 1982.SEAPORT4-      In the original network it was assumed that statutory approval for the oil terminal would have been given by March 1973 and for the unit berth terminal by June 1973-   PLA&apos;s present estimate is thatformal application for the terminals will be put forward for consider-ation by the National Ports Council before the end of 1973.RECJJAMTION5      The contract for reclamation has to be based on a firm design anda certain programme of MOD withdrawal if there is to be an acceptablemeasure of financial controls   Firm designs for reclamation cannot beprepared until the uncertainties about the MOD withdrawal and theseaport have been resolved.    Only when there are conclusions on those two aspects can the shape and rate of reclamation be decided.INFRASTRUCTURE6      The infrastructure projects, including the road and rail accessroutes to Maplin, tended not to lie on the critical path of the.
, -vfcwork.   But the times allowed for those projects had included noslack, particularly for the time consuming activities of publicparticipation.   An airport opening date later than 1980 would giveBRB a much better opportunity to achieve the technical development for the desired mode of traction.   The periods so far allowed for&apos;public inquiry and legislative procedures for the road and rail linkhave almost  certainly been under estimated;    a later opening date would allow for more reasonable time scales.    It should also make theproblem of providing early access to relieve the pressure on localroads easier to solve,ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY7      In the planning of their individual projects some of the agenciesinvolved will need to make an early decision on the equipment to beprovided, in order to allow necessary time for development, inanufac-ture and installation.    In areas of advancing technology, for exampleaviation control, passenger and freight handling systems, the judgc-ment can be delicate and it is highly desirable that the agenciesconcerned should be told as soon as possible of a revised target date.If that target date is too optimistic - that is set too early - the equipment they provide could be out of date by the time it comes intooperation.REPORT TO PARLIAMENT ON MAPLIN8      The Government has undertaken to carry out a final study of allthe factors that affect the need for the airport and to report toParliament before reclamation proceeds.    The Maplin Development bill has been amended to allow for the Secretary of State to authorisethe start of reclamation by Order, which will be subject to Parlia-mentary procedure.9 The study is being undertaken by DOE and DTI, in conjunction withthe Treasury and in consultation with other Authorities, notably BAA
id CAA.   A detailed programme of the work to be done is-being prepared.   The intention is to complete the study in time for a report,probably in the form of a White Paper, to be presented to parliament in January/March 1974.10      Provided that decisions about&apos; MOD relocation and the scope ofthe seaport were not deferred in consequence of the study, and on theassumption that Parliament did not reject the Order authorisingreclamation to start, this additional Parliamentary procedure neednot cause a further delay in opening the airport.    Preliminary con-consultations with likely contractors, the development of designs for thereclaimed area and the preparation of tender documents could proceedconcurrently with the study.11      Many of the aspects of the study, for example the estimates of.work at existing airports which would be required to cater for increases in transport movements and passengers, to improve access to them, and the calculation of noise contours depend on the date atwhich the airport, at Maplin is expected to begin operating.   Thus an agreed revised target date for opening the airport at Maplin is a necessary element in this study.CONCLUSION ON AIRPORT OPENING DATE12      The probable range of dates, on present assumptions, lies betweenDecember 1981 and June/July 1983.    BAA would not wish to start opera-ting from a new airport in the winter.   From their point of view, the test opening date is in early spring, before the main tourist season.In practical terms, therefore, it would, be sensible to put theprobable range of opening dates for a one runway airport at Maplinfrom spring 1982 to summer 1983.13      There are advantages in adopting the earliest practicable targetopening date as the basis for current planning.    It will help tocreate the climate for quick decision..on the crucial issues described in
-is paper. on. which progress now depends *   The earlier the openingdate, the less pressure there would be for capital works to increasethe capacities at existing airports;    and the relief of nuisancearound those airports - from increased, traffic and the noise of aircraft - would be achieved the sooner.    Thus the more favourablewould be the comparison, relating the years 1985 and 1990, between thefuture with Maplin and that of the alternative strategy of allowingexpansion to take place at the existing London airports?    On the otherhand, past experience indicates that processes of decision on issues of public interest take longer than the optimistic forecasts.   For that reason a target opening date of spring 198J might be more realistic.14      On balance, however, it is considered that the presentationaland practical advantages of going for an early target date out-weighthe risks of further delays being imposed..    It is therefore recommendedthat spring 1982 should be accepted as the target opening date of a one runway airport at Maplin.    This would be one of the basic assump-&apos;tions in the study now being undertaken but would be subject to reviewwhen the results were appraised.AMOUNCEMEFI OF REVISED TARGET DATE15      A formal announcement by Ministers of a new date for opening the airport could be exploited by opponents of the Maplin project, as an indication that the Government were weakening,    It could thus impede the passage of the Maplin Development Bill through its final stagesat the end of the Session in October.    The most appropriate mediumfor a formal announcement would be the report to be presented toParliament.    That would allow a revised opening date to be put in proper context with, for example, the advantages of rephasing public expenditure fully displayed.16    A revised target date will have to be given to the agencies i\Thichare due to be consulted by the Secretary of State before he presents
vis report to Parliament, notably the British Airports Authority,the Civil Aviation Authority and the Port of London Authority.   a target date so widely known is unlikely to remain confidential.Moreover the Public Expenditure White Paper, which will be published in November or December. 1973? will show a rephasing of expenditure onthe Maplin project, based on an estimated opening date in 1982/83.A move away from the original target date of 1980 would therefore beapparent before the end of the year.    It could, however, be fairlyrepresented that any revised target date given to the agencies is no more than a planning assumption at this stage and that a decision about the planned opening date for Maplin airport would not be taken until the results of the study had been appraised by Ministers.    Inthose ^circumstances Ministers should be invited to agree that their recent statements to the effect that the Government intend to get the airport operational by the early 1980&apos;s would provide sufficient cover for giving the agencies a target date of spring 1982 for the purposesof current planning.SUMMARY17      The main conclusions and proposals are as follows.(1)   The decision to relocate at TAIN, MOD&apos;s research anddevelopment facilities from Shoeburyness will have to betaken in November or December 1973 if the airport atMaplin is to open with one runway operational in the spring-.   of 1982.(2)   A further independent assessment of sites for relocating;MOD facilities now at Shoeburyness would delay the openingof the airport by a further twelve to eighteen months,that is to the summer of 1983-(3)   There are advantages in adopting the earliest practicableairport opening date as a basis for current planning.   It
is recommended that the target date should be spring 1982.Ministers should be invited to agree that:(i) recent statements to the effect that theGovernment intends to get the Maplin airportoperational in the early 1980&apos;s would provide sufficient cover for giving the agencies a targetdate of spring 1982;    and that(ii) the formal announcement of a revised opening date should be made in the report to be presented toParliament early in 1974.
