THE PRICE AND PAY CODE FOR STAGE 3IntroductionThis document is in two parts. The first describes the proposals whichthe Government are now making and which are to be the subject of consultation. It also relates them to the stage which we haye reached inthe counter-inflation programme and to the expected economic background of Stage 3. In the absence of agreed voluntary arrangements these proposals would need to be reflected in a revision of the Stage 2 Price and Pay Code.The second part therefore explains the amendments to the Code whichwould be necessary and contains a draft of a revised Code.The Government have already had extensive discussions with the tuc and CBI in the period of preparation of their proposals. Other organisationshave given the Government their views. There will now be:wide consultationabout the amendments to the Code set out in the second part of this document,in accordance with the specific statutory requirement, and the government hope that further discussions on their proposals can take place with the tuc and CBI. The next step will be for the Government to seek the approvalof Parliament for the policies for Stage 3.144118

PART ITHE GOVERNMENTS PROPOSALS1. The objectives of the programme for controlling inflation are un-changed. They are: to maintain a high rate of growth and to improve realincomes; to improve the position of the low-paid and pensioners; and to moderate the rate of cost and price inflation. These objectives are held in common by the Government, the TUC and the CBI. In the governments view, it is abundantly clear that policies to control inflation and to achieve these objectives are still needed. The Government are therefore bringing forward in this Consultative Document proposals for the next stage of theprogramme.2. The Government hold to their view that agreed voluntary arrange-ments for the control of inflation would be better than statutory measures.They will continue to seek an effective voluntary agreement with both sides of industry. The terms of the Counter-Inflation Act 1973 would.permit achange to control based on voluntary agreement at any time. The Govern-ment will seek the highest possible measure of agreement over parts of thefield even if full agreement cannot for the time being be attained./!3. However, agreement over the whole field would, in the Goyernmenf view, require acceptance that there must be restraint, in a form whichguarantees its effectiveness, on both prices and pay. We cannot returnto pay settlements giving increases at the rate of 15 per cent ormore of the kind which happened in the autumn of 1972. Of the costs which lead to price increases and which are within our own control, the biggest is pay. Accordingly, the Government now present for Stage 3proposals for restraint on price and pay increases which are firm and fair.Stages 1 and 24. In Stages 1 and 2 we have succeeded in restraining the domesticcauses of inflation. But we have had to face a surge in world prices of a kind which has not struck the United Kingdom for over 20 years. world price increases have pressed on the prices in our shops, both directly and through the sterling exchange rate. They have turned the terms of tradesharply against us at heavy cost to the balance of payments, and the effect ofthis on the exchange rate has added to the pressure on prices.5. Nevertheless, the price and pay controls, with the expansion ofproduction, have helped us to avoid piling a full-scale domestic inflation on top of an imported one. Import prices rose by 24 per cent between November1972 and August this year. But the wholesale prices of manufactured products sold on the home market rose by only 4-7 per cent (6-2 per centexcluding the effect of the VAT changeover). Again, raw material costs of manufactured foods rose between November 1972 and August 1973 by28 per cent. The increase in the wholesale price index for such foods washeld to 11 per cent and their retail price in the shops to only Z\ per cent.As a result of the restraint we have exercised on pay increases and the rapid increase in production, we have kept down our costs of production with
benefit to our own price level, and to the prices of our exports. At the sametime, increases in earnings have kept ahead of price increases. The index of earnings per head increased between November 1972 and July 1973 by8*1 per cent compared with an increase over the same period in the retail price index of 6 -1 per cent.6. Most important of all, Stages 1 and 2 of the counter-inflation pro-gramme have enabled us to continue a high rate of economic growth. Wewould have had to cut back growth if pay had continued on the run-awaycourse of the autumn of 1972. That would have brought the recovery ofindustrial investment to a halt, with further long-term damage to nationalprosperity.Economic Background to Stage 37. In his 1973 Budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer aimed at a growth rate of about 5 per cent between the second half of 1972 and thefirst half of 1974, with some slowing down in the later part of the period as the economy approached full use of capacity. The Government expect that this growth rate will be achieved and that growth will continue during1974 at a rate of about 3-  per cent broadly in line with the long-termrate of growth of the economy&apos;s productive potential. The economy isexpanding at a sustainable rate, there are favourable opportunities for exports, and the counter-inflation programme gives industry confidence thatgrowth can be maintained. All these factors favour a continuation of therise in industrial investment and give a prospect of permanent improvementin the capacity of the economy for sustained growth.8. But if this improvement is to be achieved we shall have to leaveroom during Stage 3 not only for the rising investment planned by manufac-turing industry but also for the continuation of the rise in export volumerequired to improve the balance of payments. The reduction in public expenditure announced by the Chancellor on 21 May had this objective inview. The Government expect that, provided we do not suffer from afurther surge in world commodity prices, it will be possible, consistently with the needs of exports and investment, for consumers&apos; expenditure torise in Stage 3 at a rate not far from that of the economy as a whole.9. Realisation of this depends on the course of world commodity prices. As explained above, we are suffering a charge on our living standards from the rise in world commodity prices during Stages 1 and 2which as a community we cannot avoid. That burden has still to be borneas more of our output has to go as exports to pay for imports at higher prices. The full impact of some world price increases, especially of wheat and other cereals, has yet to show itself in our domestic prices. Providedthat we do not suffer yet another surge in world prices during Stage 3,and provided that we keep control of the domestic causes of inflation, wecan expect to see the benefit of our restraint in a lower rate of increasein the cost of living in 1974.
THE PROPOSALS SUMMARISED10. Against the background of the discussions with the TUC, the cbi and others, of experience in Stage 2, and of the likely developmentof the economy in Stage 3, the Government now make the proposals for stage 3 which are summarised below. They provide for continued strict control of prices, the protection and improvement of living standards,especially those of the low paid, and the encouragement of investment and efficiency in the interests of future prosperity.Prices, Profits and Dividends11. The Government propose to maintain a strict control of prices and profits in manufacturing and retailing through the Price Code. they also propose to continue control of dividends. In addition to the price control, the Code would, under the Governmenfs pay proposals set out below, provide for a safeguard against high price increases, so as to protectliving standards by means of a &quot; threshold&quot; scheme under national rules.12. The aims of the Governmenfs proposals for the Price Code are:to enforce the control strictly and fairly so as to restrain price increases and secure price reductions to protect and encourage the investment on which our [futureprosperity depends.13.  The main proposals are:(i) Artificial subdivision of enterprises to avoid the restraint of the profit margin control to be discontinued.(ii) Category II firms (in manufacturing, those with sales between 5 million and  50 million a year) to be required to notify price increases to the Price Commission as they are made.(iii) Nationalised industry prices to continue to make a major contribu-tion to price restraint under the Code.(iv) Increases in depreciation costs to be taken into account for pricesso as to help investment.(v) Reduction of profit margins by the operation of the control to belimited to 10 per cent, so that the fall in profits will not discourageinvestment.(vi) Special provision to modify the price control for capital intensiveenterprises which had a major plant with under-utilised capacity atthe start of Stage 2.(vii) Firms suffering losses or earning low profits to be permitted to raisetheir return on capital to 8 per cent before becoming subject to price control.(viii) The rate of dividend increase to continue to be limited to 5 percent per annum, but with some latitude where new capital has tobe raised for investment.Pay14.  The aims of the Governmenfs pay policy for Stage 3 are:to be fair and to give special help for the low paidto provide for greater flexibility in negotiations to protect living standards against a high rate of increases in prices.
15.   The Government therefore propose provision for:(i) Pay increases for the group up to 7 per cent or, if negotiatorsprefer, up to an average of  2-25 a week per head for the group,with an individual maximum of  350 a year.(ii) A flexibility margin of a further 1 per cent which will be availableto negotiators for use in settlements which remove anomalies andobstacles to the better use of manpower.(iii) Extra payments under new efficiency schemes when they showgenuine savings and contribute to stabilising prices.(iv) Bringing premium payments to those working &quot; unsocial&quot; hoursup to a minimum standard.(v) Dealing with anomalies created by the standstill.(vi) Further progress towards equal pay.(vii) Increases in certain types of London allowance outside the pay limit.(viii) The threshold safeguard to enable pay to be increased up to 40p aweek if, in Stage 3, the increase in the Retail Price Index reaches7 per cent and by up to another 40p per week for every 1 per centrise above that level.In addition the Government have decided that 1 January will be a bank holiday and that arrangements should be made for an additional holidayin Scotland.16. The Government also intend to carry further the consultations withthe TUC and CBI on their proposal for a new body which would helpimprove the capacity of industry to raise pay levels for the lower paid.17.   These proposals are described in more detail below.PRICES, PROFITS AND DIVIDENDS18. In formulating proposals for the Price Code for Stage 3 theGovernment have had in mind three main considerations. First, the effects of world price increases are still pressing on prices in our shops. The wholeobjective of the counter-inflation programme is to restrain prices, and itis right and fair that control of prices and profits should be strictly appliedso as to prevent profits being made out of inflation.19. Secondly, the Code can be expected to have a heavier impact onmanufacturers in Stage 3 than in Stage 2. The Code limits the extentto which cost increases may be passed on as price increases, and the scope for reducing costs to offset this through fuller utilisation of existing plantwill be more limited. Thirdly, it will be particularly important in Stage 3to encourage investment now that the economy is approaching full useof existing capacity.Manufacturers&apos; and Retailers&apos; Prices20. The Government propose that the revised Code should operatefor prices from 1 November 1973. It will retain the main features of the stage 2 Code, including the control of cost increases which may be reflected in prices. The control of profit margins will also be retained and in certain respects strengthened.
Control of Profit Margins21. Subdivision of enterprises has been used in some cases to avoid the restraint of the profit margin control and extend the scope for price increases.The Government propose that subdivision for profit margin control shouldbe discontinued, except where there was before 30 April 1973 a separatemanagement and accounting unit reporting to the main board. Except inthese cases therefore margins will in general be calculated for the wholeenterprise or group. ;Wider notification of price increases22. The Government propose in Stage 3 to take steps to enforce the code more strictly for Category II companies (in manufacturing, this meanscompanies with sales of between  5 million and  50 million a year), and anorder will be made requiring these companies to report price increases andtheir justification as they are made. It will not apply to companies in distribution and construction where there is at present no pre-notification.The companies to which the order applies will not be required to get approvalfrom the Commission before making an increase, but prices will be rolledback if the Commission find they are inconsistent with the Code. I New orderswill also be made describing the information that will be required fromcompanies which are affected by the change in the profit margin control (seeparagraph 21) or which will be submitting quarterly reports for a periodfalling partly in Stage 2 and partly in Stage 3.Nationalised Industry prices23. The nationalised industries have helped to keep down prices to theconsumer and to industry for a period of years, covering a much longer period than Stages 1 and 2 of the counter-inflation programme. Prices ofelectricity, gas, coal, fares and postal charges, all of which are importantitems of household expenditure, have been held well below the levels whichwould have been commercially justifiable, making a significant contributionto the reduction of the price level. The Government have accepted the need to forgo important trading surpluses and to finance substantial deficits.Over and above the subsidy which the railway and coal industries would inany case have needed, the compensation payable for price restraint to theother nationalised industries is costing upwards of  150 million a year.24. In the longer term it will certainly be desirable to enable these industries to restore their profitability, so that they can make a greatercontribution to financing their essential investment programmes, whichrepresent a major part of national industrial investment, and thus reduce their requirements for borrowed funds. Nevertheless, for the present prioritymust be given to the restraint of prices in this sector of industry. the nationalised industries ,wiH continue to be subject to the requirements ofthe Price Code. There will be some clarification of the provisions on thecontainment of deficits, and an anomaly which has arisen on gas and electricity two-part tariffs will be rectified. A number of important nationalised industries which have had limited price increases in Stage 2 will not be seekingfurther increases for some time, and the Government will be prepared tocontinue to meet their essential financial requirements.   The position of
the gas industry, which has had no price increase since January 1972, willrequire special consideration, while the Code does not of course apply tothose products whose prices are determined by the coal and steel industrieswithin the framework of the European Coal and Steel Community.Investment25. The Government propose several changes in the Code which havea bearing on investment. The first is the extension of the list of cost increases which may be taken into account in the calculation of price increases. Some of the additions to the list rectify anomalies identifiedduring Stage 2. The main addition however is the inclusion of increases in depreciation charges, calculated on the basis which the enterprise hasused consistently in the period preceding the control. In a period when new investment is essential to maintain faster growth, the Government consider this extension right.26. Secondly, the Government propose a provision which would limit to 10 per cent the reduction in profit margins which can be produced bythe operation of the main provisions of the control. During Stage 2 manyfirms have had opportunities to offset any reduction in margins by increases insales. Although there are excellent opportunities in export markets,increases in output for the home market may be smaller in Stage 3 untilnew capacity becomes available. This provision would prevent discourage-ment of investment by sharp reductions in profit margins attributable to the controls.27. Other proposals bearing on investment are directed at particularsituations. Where an enterprise had major capital investment which was heavily under-utilised at the beginning of the control, either because the plant was new and had not been brought fully into use or because of sharpcyclical depression in the business, the output price which became the base for price control was in no way typical for normal operation. The fall inunit costs as output expands prevents increases in price to reflect cost increases incurred. Profits are depressed and further investment discour-aged. The proposed amendment (paragraph 63A of the revised Code) is directed at this point. Similarly, the extension of the relief for low profitsallows firms suffering losses or earning profits representing less than 8 percent return on capital to increase prices without restriction to allowable cost increases so as to reach that level of return. A continuing restrictionto a very low rate of return could be harmful to investment. Finally, an amendment to paragraph 63 makes it clear that in order to qualify forthe special relief in favour of investment in that paragraph a firm muststart expenditure on the investment within 12 months of the date ofthe price increase or of the modification of the profit margin limit, butneed not complete the investment during that period.Operation of Price Code Changes28. Generally speaking the new Code will apply to price increasesmade on or after 1 November. But where a company has to pre-notifyprice increases to the Price Commission the Stage 2 rules will apply ifthe pre-notification is received at the offices of the Commission before1 November, even though any price increase is made later.
29. Dividends will continue to be controlled in Stage 3. As in Stage 2,United Kingdom companies will not be permitted without the consent ofthe Treasury to declare dividends which exceed in total by more than 5 percent the amount declared in respect of the previous account year. There willbe some minor modifications in the administration of the control designed toremove anomalies and codify existing practice. Among these one newrule gives the Treasury some latitude on the dividend level where a com-pany has to raise new capital. Two others are aimed at removing thedifficulties which current controls cause where a company has never declareda dividend in the past, or where a company is almost entirely owned by aparent company to which the controls apply. Details are in Section iii of Part II.Business and Agricultural Rents30. Business rents have been subject to a standstill in Stages 1 and 2;and earlier White Papers referred to the Governments intention to con-sider in the course of Stage 2 their longer term policy for business rents.The Government have concluded that it is not practicable or desirable tointroduce long-term control of business rents. The present standstill willbe continued until the end of May 1974, and during the ensuing 12 monthsrents affected by the standstill will be permitted to rise, by successivegroups in turn on a first-in-first-out basis, to the market level as it was at November, 1972. Consultations over the methods of phasing to be adoptedwill take place with professional and other interests concerned. WhenStage 3 begins there will be some relaxation of the standstill on agriculturalrents to assist landlords in meeting the increased costs of their maintenanceobligations. Representatives of landlords and tenants will be invited todiscuss arrangements for establishing thereafter a proper level of agriculturalrents.PAY31. Within the overall objective of the programme the Governmenthave formulated proposals which are both fair and as flexible as is consistent with containing the costs which lead to price increases.32. In the interests of fairness, the Government propose to make special provision to help the low paid and women workers and to remove anomaliesas recommended by the Pay Board; and to see that their policies apply to everyone.33. To give greater flexibility, the Government propose to give nego-tiators a choice of pay limit and to give them greater scope over and abovethe pay limit in several ways by allowing a further 1 per cent of the pay bill as a flexibility margin, by providing for extra payments underschemes which demonstrably improve efficiency and reduce costs, and by allowing premium payments for &quot; unsocial&quot; hours to be brought up to aminimum standard.34. The choice of pay limit described below, plus the margin forflexibility, will allow increases in the pay bill of up to 8-9 per cent on averageand within this negotiators will be able to give increases at higher rates to
the low paid. In proposing a limit at this level, the Government have takenaccount of the prospect that the growth in earnings is likely to be significantlyhigher (by perhaps 2 per cent) because of increases over and above the pay limit for such things as anomalies, equal pay and overtime.35. The Government have also taken into account the increase in incomes arising from a higher level of employment. More people will benefitbecause the Governmenfs policies for continued expansion, which the payproposals are designed to underpin, are likely to increase employment as firms increase their manpower to raise production.36. The proposed new pay arrangements will allow on averagehigher increases than in Stage 2. The Government consider that they strike a fair balance between the control of inflation and the need for pay increases to protect living standards during Stage 3. A higher figure would addunacceptably to cost inflation and so produce the very price increases thatthe counter-inflation programme is intended to prevent.37. However, the Government recognise the public anxiety about thepossible effect on prices at home of any future increases in the world pricesof commodities that we have to import. They therefore propose to providea safeguard, and the proposals below include arrangements for thresholdagreements under which additional payments could be made if there were an exceptional increase in prices. Such arrangements run the risk of adding to domestic inflation if import prices rise unexpectedly fast. But the Govern-ment think it right, in the interests of fairness, to accept this risk for thenext 12 months in the special circumstances of Stage 3.The Pay Limit38. The next stage of policy will run from 7 November 1973 until theautumn of 1974. During that period negotiators and others concerned with pay determination will have a choice of pay limits.39. The maximum amount by which the average pay bill per headof the group may be increased in a 12 month period will, under the first alternative, be 7 per cent of the average pay bill per head of the groupfor the preceding 12 month period; and under the second alternative it willbe  2 - 25 per week per head of the group.40. Within the pay limit for the group no individual should receive an increase of more than  350 a year.41. These are limits and not entitlements, whether for the group orfor individuals within it. It is for negotiators to determine the appropriateincrease and conditions of settlement within the limit and to decide on thedistribution within the group, whichever form of pay limit is chosen.FairnessFor the low paid42. The Government hold to the view that the low paid shouki getspecial treatment and expect negotiators and others concerned with settle-ments to have regard to this.   Of the alternative forms of pay limit, the
straight cash limit of  2 - 25 helps lower paid groups by giving them morethan the percentage limit would. The proposal to pay compensation underthreshold agreements at a flat cash rate, regardless of level of income, willalso give greater assistance to the low paid. The draft Code providesfor further progress towards equal pay and for holidays and hours to be improved up to specified minimum standards outside the pay limit. Again,these proposals are of particular benefit to the low paid. The Governmenthave also placed before the TUC and CBI a proposal to set up a body toimprove the capacity of industries to raise pay levels for the lower paid,and are awaiting their views.By eliminating anomalies43. The Governments proposals are founded on the principle that the pay arrangements should be applied fairly. The TUC and CBI are being consulted on the Pay Board report on anomalies created by the stand still and, subject to those consultations, the Government propose to provide inthe Code that action may be taken to deal with these anomalies on thebasis recommended by the Pay Board, with staging of the increases for thehigher paid. The Code would enable similar treatment to be given to civilservants covered by pay research relating in part to a period before the standstill. The Government are now giving urgent consideration, as theBoard recommended, to the future of the pay research system within the counter-inflation programme.44. Progress in dealing with other anomalies in pay structures willbe facilitated by the 1 per cent flexibility margin which can be added tothe pay limit in settlements which make provision for such progress.45. The Pay Board is due to provide a further report to the Govern-ment by the end of this year on other problems of pay relativities whichmay arise both within and between groups of employees. The Govem-ment intend to have further consultations with both sides of industry onthat report.hi applying the Code46. The notification requirements under Stage 2 will continue andwill also apply to all increases under new provisions of the Code, includingthe flexibility margin. However, increases under the new anomaly provi-sions and the provisions for new efficiency payments schemes will have tobe notified to the Pay Board for prior approval no matter how fewemployees are covered. The Pay Board will continue their basic job ofscrutinising settlements notified to them and are increasing their spot checkson the implementation both of the larger settlements notified to them andof the smaller settlements which are outside the i notification categories.The Government are considering with the Board whether additionalnotification requirements in certain areas, such as the construction industry,would assist them in this task.Flexibility for Efficiency47. Within the general objective of holding down prices, the Govern-ment wish to encourage the maximum flexibility in negotiations on pay tosecure  the  better  use  of  manpower  and productive  resources.     By
expressing the pay limit as an addition to the pay bill for the group of employees concerned the Government are continuing to leave scope for negotiation and for flexibility in applying the total amount of the settlement to the circumstances of particular workers. But there are three new provisions which will afford greater scope for negotiators and others concerned with pay determination to secure the more efficient management of our productive resources on which a higher rate of growth depends.48. First, the pay limit may be extended by a special flexibility margin of 1 per cent of the pay bill for the group in settlements which includechanges in pay structures or systems designed to remedy anomalies orimprove efficiency. It may also be used, where appropriate, to improveholidays and sick pay benefits. Negotiators and others concerned with pay determination will be free to use the margin in ways they considermost appropriate to their particular case, within the broad scope defined in the Code. The margin may not be used earlier than the time of themain setdement except as specifically provided in the Code.49. Secondly, the Government propose that in Stage 3 there should be provision for agreements which increase efficiency. These efficiency paymentschemes will be subject to very strict criteria in order to ensure thatthey make a definite contribution to price stabilisation, and extra payments under them will not become due until savings have been achieved. Everyscheme will need prior approval by the Pay Board which, before approvingpayment under a scheme, will require evidence from three months&apos; opera-tion that the savings have been achieved. Time will be needed to prepareschemes which meet the requirements, and to make arrangements for theirscrutiny. The draft Code accordingly provides that schemes should not operate before 1 January, 1974.50. Thirdly, the Government propose that payments outside the pay limit should be allowed in order to bring premium payments to those whowork &quot; unsocial hours &quot; i.e. at night or during weekends up to a minimum standard. This provision will help encourage the introduction and main-tenance of shift working for the fuller utilisation of existing plant. It willalso help to attract into employment people who are not available for workin normal hours.Safeguards against a higher rate of price increases51. The Government propose that the draft Code should provide forthe negotiation of threshold agreements to help safeguard employees&apos; standardof living against the possibility of an exceptionally high rate of price increasesduring Stage 3.52. The base date for the purpose of these agreements would be thedate of publication of the Retail Price Index (RPI) figure for October 1973and the agreements would run for up to 12 months from that date. Theywould allow a payment of up to 40p per week to be made if the RPI reached7 per cent above the base figure and a further payment of up to 40p forevery percentage point rise in the RPI above that during the currency ofthe agreement. Payments would be outside the pay limit and would betreated as special supplements for the individual (pro rata for part-timersworking 21 hours or more a week) which would not count for calculatingovertime or other premia.
53. The Government are asking the Pay Board to carry out a review of allowances designed to compensate for the additional cost of accommoda-tion and travel in London compared with the rest of the country. Thiswill include reviewing the formula recommended by the National board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) in 1967. Meanwhile, in the context of theother proposals for Stage 3, the Government believe that it is right toprovide for increases in London allowances to be made outside the pay limit for those who were receiving them before 6 November 1972 on thebasis of the NBPI formula, and for police. The draft Code accordinglyprovides for such increases to be made outside the limit provided that theyare made on the basis of that formula.Share Option and Share Incentive Schemes54. The Finance Act 1973 provides for the introduction of ia new kindof share savings scheme. Employees in a company operating such ascheme will be able to purchase shares in their employing company onadvantageous terms, paying for those shares with the proceeds of a SaveAs You Earn contract. It is a requirement for Inland Revenue approvalthat a scheme should be available to all employees of the company whoqualify by age and service. The Government propose that these schemes should be allowed to operate without restriction in Stage 3 and arrangements will be made to enable them to be implemented from 1 December 1973.The present restrictions on the operation of other share option and shareincentive schemes will continue.New Year&apos;s Day55. The Government have decided that 1 January should be made a bank holiday. In Scotland, where it is already a bank holiday, arrangements may be made for an additional holiday on an alternative day. The costof the extra holiday will not count against the pay limit for the group.
PART IIAMENDMENTS TO THE PRICE AND PAY CODEThis part of this Consultative Document is prepared in a form intendedto assist the statutory consultations on amendments to the Price and Pay Codewhich the Government are required to undertake by Section 2 of the Counter-Inflation Act 1973. It is in three Sections. Section I is a commentary on proposed amendments to the Code. Section II is a complete draft of thePrice and Pay Code revised so as to include the amendments in heavy type.The paragraph numbers of the existing Code have been retained. Additionalparagraphs have been included as e.g. paragraph 9A. Section III contains an account of the amended arrangements for dividend control proposed for Stage 3 referred to in paragraph 29 of Part I.SECTION ICOMMENTARY ON AMENDMENTSPRICESParagraph 6 (vi): International giro and remittance services are put in thesame position as the other international postal and telecommunications services.Paragraph 6 (viii): Not all these contracts are technically with the Secretaryof State.Paragraph 6 (x): This adds taxi fares in Scotland to the list of exemptions.Like taxi fares in England and Wales which are already exempt under this sub-paragraph these fares are subject to Ministerial control.Paragraph 9A: This clarifies the basis on which the Code will apply to price increases in milk for manufacture.Paragraph 13 : This makes it clear that the amendments in paragraphs 53 and54 which restrict subdivision for net profit margin control do not apply to the parts of the Code to which net profit margins are not relevant. *Paragraph 14: Notwithstanding the amendments proposed to paragraphs 53and 54 which restrict subdivision for profit margin control purposes, this leavesit open to an enterprise with mixed activities (e.g. manufacturing and distribution)to treat these activities separately for both price and profit margin control.Paragraph 15: Consequential on the changes made in paragraph 13. Theadditional sentence clarifies the position of co-operatives, partnerships and soletraders under the Code.Paragraph 18: This makes it clear that the requirement to reduce pricesapplies in the case of distributors where they exceed or are likely to exceed theirgross percentage margin.Paragraph 19: The base date for allowable cost increases is moved forward to 30 April 1973 (the beginning of Stage 2), except where there has been noprice increase on a product or a range of related products since the Stage 2 basedate of 30 September 1972. In this case cost increases first incurred since thatdate can be taken into account in the first price increase in Stage 3.Paragraph 20: Sub-paragraph (iii) is consequential on the changes in para-graph 25 (ii). It provides that the date from which the additional allowable cost increases in paragraph 25 (ii) may be recovered should be the date when the revised Code for prices comes into operation. The additional sentence makes itclear that the limitation in paragraph 16 (which restricts the permitted price increase by reference to the increase in total costs per unit) is overridden wherethe price increase includes an element for the retrospective recovery of costsunder this paragraph.144118b
Paragraphs 21 and 25 (i): Consequential on the change of the base date inparagraph 19.  There are also consequential deletions in paragraph 22.Paragraph 25 (ii) : Additions to the list of allowable cost increases. Some ofthese remove anomalies. The addition of depreciation benefits enterprises whichhave recently increased investment.Paragraphs 26 and 27: Consequential on the revision of the Pay Code. Itensures that pay increases which were consistent with the pay policy whether for stage 2 or Stage 3, in force at the time they were made, will be allowable cost increases, subject to the productivity deduction under paragraph 29, in stage 3.Paragraph 30A: The productivity deduction and the definition of allowable cost increases restrict the extent to which prices can be increased when costsrise. This new paragraph provides an important safeguard by setting a limit to the reduction of profit margins which the cumulative effect of these provisionscould produce. Further cost absorption would not be required if the limitwere reached.Paragraph 31: This makes it clear that the rules for allocating costs applyto the calculation of total cost increases as well as of allowable cost increases.Paragraph 34: In appropriate circumstances the Commission would be ableto announce average cost (and hence price) reductions for a sector includingsmall enterprises as well as average cost increases. The change in heading isintended to make it clear that paragraphs 34-37 can be applied where sectorsdo not consist entirely of small enterprises.Paragraphs 35, 36 and 37:   Consequential on the amendment of paragraph 34.Paragraph 44: The existing paragraph 44 provides that where manufacturerswho are dependent on raw materials which fluctuate frequently in price mayanticipate future estimated cost increases, they must hold the price so determined for six months. The amendment relaxes this requirement by substituting threemonths for six months in the light of recent rapid movements in raw material prices.Paragraph 46: This clarifies the intention of paragraph 46 by putting intospecific terms the requirement to make the productivity deduction.Paragraph 46A: This new paragraph is intended to make it clear that the productivity deduction in the Code applies to prime cost contracts.Paragraph 47: This new paragraph clarifies the rule on discounts in theexisting Code.Paragraph 48: Consequential on the treatment of discounts in paragraph 47.Paragraph 48A: This exempts test-marketing for a limited period from thenormal rules under the Code: the &quot; test price &quot; need not be regarded as a baseprice to which future price changes must be related.Paragraph 49: The amendment in subparagraph (ii) clarifies the treatmentof loss-making companies by providing that the restriction of price increases inparagraph 16 (by reference to increases in total costs per unit) does not applyto the extent that it would cause the enterprise to operate at a loss. Theadditional sentence makes it clear that this paragraph exempts enterprises makinga loss, or at risk of doing so, only from the price controls in the Code andnot from the net profit margin controls.Paragraph 50: Consequential on the amendments to paragraph 53-4 whichrestrict subdivision for net profit margin control.Paragraph 51: Consequential on the addition of depreciation to the list ofallowable cost increases in paragraph 25 (ii).Paragraph 52: Where an excess in Stage 2 over the Stage 2 reference levelbecomes apparent in Stage 3, only the excess over the Stage 2 reference levelneed be offset. Price reductions will however.still be required to avoid exceeding the Stage 3 reference level after 1 November 1973.
Paragraphs 53 and 54: These amended paragraphs restrict subdivision fornet profit margin purposes. They impose more stringent conditions on theextent to which enterprises may calculate the reference level other than on a group basis. They apply to paragraphs 30A, 61, 62 and 63A; and also to para-graph 63 for any modification of the profit margin limit.Paragraph 58: This makes the profit margin controls more effective. Treat-ing years of loss as years of no trading allows the net profit margin referencelevel to be raised artificially or makes it impossible to calculate a reference level.Paragraph 60: This makes it clear that an amalgamated enterprise may takeadvantage of the modification of the profit margin reference level permitted bythis paragraph.Paragraph 61: Enterprises with low profits are at present exempted fromprofit margin control. This amendment extends this exemption to other aspectsof the control. Without this provision an enterprise making use of the lossprovisions in paragraph 49 could never move into a position of profit. This could have a discouraging effect on investment if it remained unchanged during the longer period of Stage 3. The definition of low profits has been changed from a5 to an 8 per cent rate of return on capital.Paragraph 63: This clarifies the criteria under which the Commission mayallow departure from the controls in order to encourage investment. In particular,it makes it clear that the qualifying investment does not have to come on streamwithin a specified period but that the expenditure on the relevant investment mustbegin within 12 months. It more closely reflects the time scale of investmentdecisions.Paragraph 63A: This is a new provision to deal with enterprises which arecapital intensive and had abnormally high unit costs at the base date because of low utilisation of a plant accounting for at least 25 per cent of turnover.Paragraph 67: The gross percentage margin control applies to all homes salesby distributors, including sales of products exempted from the Code by para-graph 6.Paragraph 70: The additional sentence makes it clear that this paragraphexempts distributors making a loss only from the gross percentage margin controland not from the net profit margin control.Paragraph 71: The amendments make it clear that when distributors exceedtheir gross percentage margin, or are likely to do so, they should take the sameaction to reduce prices as when their net profit margin reference level is exceeded.The additional phrase in brackets provides that where an excess in Stage 2over the Stage 2 reference level becomes apparent in Stage 3, only the excess overthe Stage 2 reference level need be offset. Price reductions will, however, still berequired to avoid exceeding the Stage 3 reference level after 1 November 1973.Paragraph 72: This enables the Price Commission to take action where theyconsider that the cost of goods to distributors has risen substantially. It removesthe condition that the rise in those costs must have been out of line with themovement of prices generally.Paragraph 75 (i): This sub-paragraph, together with the additional sentence atthe end of the paragraph, clarifies what is meant for a nationalised industry by being &quot; in deficit&quot;. It also defines the units to which the provisions of the para-graph will apply.Paragraph 75 (ii): The extent to which a nationalised industry may benefit under the provisions dealing with loss-making enterprises in the private sector isclarified.Paragraph 75 (iii): Consequential on the new paragraphs 30A and 63A andon the amendments to paragraphs 61 and 62.Paragraph 15 A: This new paragraph removes anomalies. It is intended tomake it possible to apply the Code to multi-part tariffs in the gas and electricity industries where the structure of the tariffs is such that as sales increase, averagerevenue per unit falls. It also makes provision for the statutory obligation ofthese industries to meet demand.19144118 B 2
Paragraph 80: This clarifies the distinction between nationalised industries andother public sector trading enterprises.Paragraph 89: Consequential on the inclusion of paragraph 46A.Paragraph 100A: This amendment enables unjustified price increases whichwere made during Stage 2 but which do not come to the Commission^ noticeuntil after the start of Stage 3 to be reduced according to the Stage 2 rules. Inthe absence of this provision an unjustified price increase made in Stage 2 couldbecome the &quot; base price &quot; for further increases in Stage 3.PAYParagraph 101 (ii): This principle has been expanded in accordance with thenew provisions in the Code for the remedying of anomalies.Paragraph 101 (v): This principle has been added to emphasise the import-ance of the new provisions for encouraging the better use of productive resources, notably the provisions for efficiency schemes and the flexibility margin.Paragraph 107 (iii): This amendment allows increases which do not count against the pay limit to be paid less than 12 months after the group lastreceived a principal increase, subject in some cases to the special rules on timingset out in later paragraphs.Paragraph 108: New types of increase which are not principal increases havebeen added.Paragraph 109 sets out the new pay limit. It gives negotiatorsand others concerned with pay determination a choice in the case of each group between 7 per cent of the average pay bill per head of the group forthe preceding 12 months and  2-25 per week per head.Paragraph 109A: This amendment allows groups who do not negotiate but have settlements for another group automatically applied to them to continue todo so in respect of settlements for the other group within the pay limit underthis Code.Paragraph 111: The date has been revised as necessary and the last sentence of the previous Code dropped as the circumstances will no longer arise.Paragraph 113: This amendment brings up to date the requirements of para-graph 113 in the previous Code.Paragraph 117: This amendment is to make clear how the pay limit shouldbe applied as a monthly or weekly increase.Paragraph 118A: This refers to the new option of a straight cash pay limit.Paragraph 118J3 allows fees for occasional work, which may not have been reviewed for some time, to be increased by the equivalent of the pay limit appliedat an annual rate for the period since they were last increased up to a maximum of three years.Paragraph 120: A definition of standard working hours has been added.Paragraphs 120A-D complement the existing provisions on hours and holidaysin paragraphs 125 and 127 by allowing improvements outside the pay limit interms of employment relating to night and weekend working where these arebelow the standard applying in industry generally.Paragraph 121: Increases within the new flexibility margin (except newpersonal increments) are excluded from the individual pay limit, which is raised to  350.
Paragraphs 121A and B allow the pay limit to be increased by 1 per centwhere negotiators need a margin of flexibility to reach agreement (i) on changesin pay and grading structures or systems of payment designed to increase efficiency or remedy anomalies or (ii) on improvements in holidays, holiday payor sick pay.Paragraph 123: The special provision for progress towards equal pay to bemade outside the pay limit has been extended to make clear that it applies to cases where women&apos;s jobs, though different from those of men, have been given  an equal value to men&apos;s jobs under a job evaluation scheme which satisfies the specified conditions.Paragraph 125: The amendment makes clear that the concession does notapply where there has been an agreement in the past to consolidate overtimepayments into a higher basic wage for a longer working week.Paragraph 127(i): The increase from six to seven occasional or public holidays allows for the addition of 1 January (or in Scotland an alternativeday).Paragraph 127A provides that the extra cost of a holiday on 1 January willnot count against the pay limit even for those who already have seven or moreoccasional or public holidays.Paragraph 128: This amendment sets out the method for determining thecost of increases in holidays where this is required to be counted against the pay limit.Paragraph 133A allows payment outside the pay limit of allowances for temporary work during the currency of the revised Code by those involved inthe statutory reorganisation of local government Le. Local Authority ChiefExecutives and Chief Officers and equivalent grades in the NHS and police.Paragraph 137: This paragraph has been amended to apply to schemes which benefit redundant workers who are redeployed within the same enterpriseas well as those who are dismissed, provided in either case that the schemerequires at least a year&apos;s continuous service.Paragraph 138: This amendment clarifies the position where the terms of profit sharing schemes operating on or before 6 November 1972 are not inwriting.Paragraph 139: The additional first sentence enables share savings schemesof the kind announced in the 1973 Budget to proceed outside the requirementsof the Code. The provisions relating to other types of share option and shareincentive schemes are unchanged.Paragraph 141A enables increases in London allowances conforming toNBPI Report No. 44 and police pay differentials for London to be paid outsidethe pay limit.Paragraph 142 (ii): The amendment is to make clear that reimbursement ofremoval expenses should be treated in the same way as expenses incurred in thecourse of employment.Paragraph 142 (iii): This addition covers rent allowances paid to those, forexample policemen, who are required to live in particular locations as part oftheir conditions of service.Paragraphs 143 and 144: These amendments clarify the way in which the pay limit should be applied where settlements or pay determinations are con-cluded at more than one level.Paragraph 146: This amendment will facilitate monitoring of earnings from existing payment by results schemes by providing that as from July 1974 increasedearnings arising from increased output will be outside the pay limit only underschemes providing adequate management control information.
Paragraph 147: This updates the corresponding provision in the previousCode.Paragraphs 148-9: The amendments make clear that, where the new schemesintroduced under these limited arrangements (which also applied under theprevious Code) are schemes of payment by results, the provisions of paragraph146 apply.Paragraphs 149 A and B provide for the negotiation and introduction of efficiency schemes under strictly controlled conditions which will ensure that additional payments, limited to 50 per cent above what is allowable within the pay limit, are made only after a minimum trial period of three months hasdemonstrated to the satisfaction of the Pay Board that the savings outweigh the costs by at least as much again as the cost of the pay increases, and makea definite contribution to cost reduction. It will also be a condition that the employer should maintain full and detailed control information to enable the pay Board to monitor, in such ways as may be appropriate, the continuingoperation of the scheme.Paragraphs 150 and 151: These amendments bring these paragraphs up todate.Paragraph 152A provides transitional arrangements for settlements relatingto a date prior to, but not implemented before, the coming into operation ofthe revised Code.Paragraph 152B allows payments to be made under threshold agreements,as described in Part I.Paragraphs 152C to K provide for the remedying of anomalies as described in Part I.
SECTION ii draft OF A REVISED PRICE AND PAY CODE1. The Code has a dual function. First, the Price Commission and pay board are required to exercise their powers so as to ensure that it is imple-mented. Secondly, all those concerned with the determination of prices and pay should have regard to it.2. The Code is therefore addressed both to the Commission and the Boardand to all those concerned with price and pay determination. Part I dealswith prices and Part II with pay.Part I PricesGeneral Principles3.   The general principles relating to prices are: (i) to limit the extent to which prices may be increased! on account of increased costs, and to secure reductions as a result of reduced costs;(ii) to reinforce the control of prices by a control on profit margins whilesafeguarding investment;(iii) to reinforce the effects of competition, and to secure its full benefits inthe general level of prices.Field of Application4. With the exceptions specified in paragraphs 5 to 10 below, the prices ofgoods and services supplied to the United Kingdom home market are withinthe scope of the control.5. The prices of goods and services exported (whether directly or through an agent or merchant) are not controlled.6.   The following are not controlled:  (i) prices paid on first sale into the United Kingdom of imported goods and services;(ii) prices of goods and services where the application of the control wouldbe inconsistent with an international agreement or arrangement. Forthis purpose, an international agreement or arrangement is one between states or organisations of states, not between firms;(iii) prices at sales by auction, where such sales are a normal practice in theparticular trade;(iv) prices of goods at the point of sale on a commodity market in theUnited Kingdom such as the London Metal Exchange or prices directlydetermined by reference to such markets;(v) prices of second-hand goods (other than second-hand road vehicles soldby distributors);(vi) charges for the carriage of goods or passengers on internationaljourneys; charges for air navigation, landing and related services and ship, passenger and goods dues, provided that they relate wholly or mainly to such traffic; charges for international mail, Giro, remittanceand telecommunication services;(vii) prices of ethical medicines supplied to the United Kingdom market tothe extent that regulation of their prices is within the scope of anyt agreement relating to those prices made between the Secretary of Statefor Social Services and representatives of manufacturers of thosemedicines; but only so long as such an agreement is in force;
(viii) prices in contracts for the Secretary of State for Defence for warlike stores and services which are within the agreement between her majesty&apos;s Government and industry governing the pricing of, and controlof profit from, non-competitive contracts. These prices will be subjectto the controls provided in that agreement;(ix) insurance premiums, which will be subject to restriction by the Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry;(x) taxi fares, where subject to control by the Home Secretary or theSecretary of State for Scotland ;(xi) prices determined by a statutory body which, as a result of an order made under section 8 of the Counter-Inflation Act 1973, is required toapply the Code to the determination of those prices;(xii) subscriptions and certain prices charged by non-profit-making organisa-tions as in paragraphs 98 to 100.Application to Food, Farming and Forestry Products7. The prices of manufactured food and drink, like those of manufactured products generally, are within the scope of the control as are those of semi-processed foodstuffs such as butter, cheese, sugar and quick-frozen vegetables.8. The prices paid to United Kingdom producers or producers&apos; organisationsor to overseas suppliers for fresh foods and similar products, which are subject to fluctuations on world and United Kingdom markets because ofseasonal factors or changes in the relationship between supply and demand,are not controlled. This applies in particular to meat, including bacon and poultry, fish, eggs, fruit and vegetables. However, enterprises which resell these products, whether home-produced or imported, at any subsequent stage will besubject to control.9. The retail price of milk for liquid consumption and the margins of milkdistributors will continue to be subject to the existing controls by the Ministerof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Scotland.So long as these controls apply, the price of milk for liquid consumption willnot be subject to the Code.9A. The prices of milk for manufacture will, however, be subject to thefollowing requirements. Except where the Milk Marketing Boards incuradditional allowable cost increases in marketing the milk: (i) the price of milk for the manufacture of butter and skimmed milkpowder may not be increased above current levels (adjusted as neces-sary to reflect changes in the intervention prices); and(ii) for other milk products, the price of milk may not be increased abovethe prices of milk for butter and skimmed milk powder (adjusted by not more than the average premium received by the Boards for milk for the product concerned over the butter and skimmed milk prices in the year ending 30 April 1973).10. What is said in paragraph 8 in relation to prices paid for fresh foodsapplies also to prices of other primary products of animal or vegetable originwhich are subject to similar fluctuations.Charges11. References in the Code to prices include references to charges, unless there is explicit provision to the contrary.Goods and Services12. References in the Code to goods include references to services, unless there is explicit provision to the contrary.
Definition of Enterprise for the purposes of the Code13. For the purposes of the Code other than those for which the unit fornet profit margin control as defined in paragraphs 53 and 54 is relevant, an enterprise means either an enterprise as a whole or a separate constituent company or sub-division provided that in the latter case separate accounts for suchsub-divisions : (i) are or can be made available for all relevant periods;(ii) are not materially distorted by transactions conducted otherwise than onarm&apos;s length terms;(iii) would, if combined with one another and with the accounts of all other activities or transactions of the enterprise, produce results consistent withthose shown by the accounts of the enterprise taken as a whole.14. Where the activities of an enterprise are not confined to manufacturing,distribution, or the provision of services, but include more than one of these,each of these activities may be treated separately for all the purposes of the Codeincluding the calculation of net profit margins provided that adequate accountssatisfying paragraph 13 are or can be made available for each of them. where these activities are not treated separately, the main activity of the enterprise willdetermine whether the provisions of the Code relating to manufacturing,distribution or services apply.15. Any reference in the Code to an enterprise includes a reference to an activity of an enterprise which is to be treated separately under paragraph 14.A reference to an enterprise includes a reference to a co-operative, a partnershipor to an individual carrying on a business.Costs and Prices16. Prices which are within the control may not be increased unless thereis an increase in total costs per unit of output. No increase may exceed theincrease in total costs per unit.17. Where there is an increase in total costs per unit, only certain increases,referred to in the Code as &quot; allowable cost increases&quot;, may be taken intoaccount in arriving at the permitted price increase, and they will be subjectto a productivity deduction.Price Reduction18. Prices should be reduced whenever possible. Where there is a fallin raw material prices or other allowable costs, this should be fully reflected in price reductions. Reductions are however not required to exceed the fall in total costs per unit of output. In addition prices should be reduced as requiredin paragraphs 52 and 71 where an enterprise exceeds, or is likely to exceed,its profit margin reference level, or in the case of a distributor, its gross percentagemargin.Base Date19. The starting point for the calculation of permitted price increases isthe level of costs per unit of output at 30 April 1973. In calculating permittedprice increases, cost increases first incurred after 30 April 1973 may be takeninto account, to the extent that they have not already been reflected in prices.Where the price of a particular product or of a range of related products has notbeen increased since 30 September 1972, cost increases first incurred after thatdate may be taken into account and that date should be substituted for 30 Aprilin paragraphs 21 and 25 below. However, except as in paragraph 20, the permitted price increase may not include any element of retrospective recovery of costs incurred before the date on which the price increase takes effect.20. A permitted price increase made after 30 April 1973 may include an element of recovery of costs incurred between 30 April 1973 and the date of the permitted price increase provided that:  
(i) the amount included in respect of such costs does not exceed what wouldbe necessary to recover the costs over a period of 12 months beginning with the date of implementation of the permitted price increase;(ii) in the calculation of any subsequent price increase under the Code,the &quot; selling price &quot; referred to in paragraph 21 (iii) should exclude any element which represents a recovery of costs under this paragraph ; and(iii) the costs were allowable cost increases under the provisions of the Codein force at the time they were incurred.Where a price increase includes such an element of recovery of costs the increase may exceed the increase in total costs per unit by the amount necessary topermit the recovery of those costs.Calculation of Permitted Price Increase21.   The maximum permitted price increase should be arrived at as follows: (i) calculate the change in total costs per unit and allowable cost increasesper unit (as reduced by the productivity deduction) between the basedate and the date of the price increase; cost increases which have alreadybeen reflected in prices should be excluded;(ii) express allowable cost increases per unit as a percentage of total costs per unit at the base date;(iii) apply the resulting percentage to the selling price at the base date inorder to establish the new permitted price level.In (i), (ii) and (iii) above, &quot; base date&quot; means 30 April 1973, or at the option of the enterprise, the date of any subsequent price increase.22. The calculation of the level of costs per unit referred to in paragraph 21 (i)should be based on the levels of pay and other costs ruling at the base date and onthe level of output over the most recent representative period completed by thatdate (e.g. the previous quarter) for which adequate records are available. similarly the calculation of costs per unit at the date of the price increase may take account,in accordance with the normal practice of the enterprise, of increases in rawmaterial prices and other allowable cost increases up to the date of the price increase and should reflect the output level achieved in the most recent repre-sentative period (e.g. the quarter preceding the date of the price increase).23. The levels of unit costs calculated in this way will not necessarily bethe same as the average figures recorded for the whole of the period chosen,e.g. if pay or other costs changed during the period. If output in the period was materially affected by abnormal factors such as holidays, an appropriateadjustment should be made. If this is impossible, the previous normal operatingperiod should be chosen with appropriate adjustments to allow for changes inthe level of pay or other costs.24. Where price increases are being made not on a single product but ona range of related products (under paragraphs 38 or 39) the procedure inparagraphs 21 to 23 still applies. But in this case the group of related products should be considered as a single product; the costs per unit can be expressed either as costs per unit of volume of output or if a volume measureis impracticable as costs per   of sales value. Where the calculated permittedpercentage price increase is not applied uniformly to the whole range of products,the weighted average percentage price increase made on the selling prices ofthe products within the group may not exceed this percentage.Allowable Cost Increases25. Subject to the following paragraphs, a cost increase may be regarded asan allowable cost increase for the purpose of paragraph 17 if : (i) it was first incurred after 30 April 1973; and(ii) it was incurred for one of the following :  (a) labour;(b) materials, components, consumable stores, fuel and power;
(c) rent of premises and rates;id) interest charges, as defined in paragraph 28, and depreciation,calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principlesconsistently applied by the enterprise concerned;(e) certain bought-in services, that is: transport, hire of equipment,insurance, storage, maintenance and engineering services not of a capital nature, postage and telephones;(/) commission processing and other sub-contracted operations onmaterials or components incorporated into the product; and(iii) it has not already been reflected in prices.Pay not consistent with the Code26. Cost increases arising from increases in pay (as denned in paragraph 103)after 6 November 1972 are allowable cost increases only to the extent that, as appropriate:  (i) they were consistent with the policies set out in the White PapersCmnd. 5125 and Cmnd. 5205 (and do not contravene an order ornotice under the Counter-Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1972);or(ii) as regards the period commencing on 1 April 1973, they were consistent with the provisions of the Code in force at the time of the pay increase(and do not contravene an order or notice under the Counter-InflationAct 1973).27. Examples of cost increases which are not allowable cost increases becausethey are inconsistent with the Code are:  (i) any part of a pay increase which exceeds the pay limit; or(ii) any part of increases in pay under settlements made at local or plantlevel which, when aggregated with increases under a national agreement,exceeds the pay limit for the group concerned; and(iii) any part of increases in earnings arising from piecework or other pay-ment by results schemes which exceeds the pay limit,unless the increase is or was specifically exempted from the pay limit by Part ii of the Code. &quot;Interest Charges28. Increases in interest charges payable by an enterprise are allowable cost increases, unless the charges or the increases in them: -(i) represent a distribution of profits rather than a true interest charge; or(ii) where they arise on loans between related undertakings, relate to loanswhich are not strictly required for the business or represent interest inexcess of that which would be charged in a transaction at arm&apos;s length; or(iii) represent interest which would properly be regarded as capital expendi-ture in the period in which it is incurred.   ,Productivity Deduction29. In order to ensure that the benefits of increased productivity are passed on to the consumer, a deduction should be made from allowable cost increases which are to be passed on as price increases. Enterprises are required to absorb50 per cent of allowable cost increases arising from increases in labour costs,with the exclusions listed in paragraph 30, unless the share of labour costs as awhole in their total costs exceeds 35 per cent. In that case enterprises arerequired to absorb only an amount equal to the percentage of total costs whichwould apply if labour costs represented 35 per cent of total costs.
30. The deduction for productivity under paragraph 29 need not be appliedto increases in:  employers&apos; national insurance contributions; training costs; the cost of improvements under paragraph 123 (equal pay), paragraph 134 (recognisedterms and conditions), paragraph 135 (pensions) and paragraph 137(redundancy and incapacity benefits).Safeguard to limit reduction of profit margins30A. (i) Where the effect of one or more of the provisions of the Codelisted in sub-paragraph (ii) below would be to reduce the net profit margin of the enterprise, as defined in paragraphs 53 and 54, bymore than one-tenth below the level in the period before the base dateused in calculating a permitted price increase in paragraphs 21-23, the enterprise may limit that reduction to one-tenth in calculating permittedprice increases for the purposes of the Code.(ii) The provisions referred to in sub-paragraph (i) are : (a) paragraph 25 (ii) which determines those cost increases which rankas allowable cost increases;(b) paragraph 29 which prescribes the productivity deduction to bemade from certain labour cost increases.(iii) The permitted price increase calculated under sub-paragraph (i) maynot exceed the increase in total costs per unit for the product or range of related products concerned.(iv) This paragraph does not apply where the profit margin reference level is, or is likely to be, exceeded; or where prices are being reduced (or price increases restricted) to eliminate the excess over profit marginreference levels in an earlier period.Allocation of Costs to Controlled Prices31. Allocation of costs to particular controlled goods or services for the calculation of allowable cost increases or increases in total costs may be necessarywhere an enterprise : (i) sells in both home and overseas markets; or(ii) makes sales at home, some of which are within and some outside thescope of the control; or(iii) makes sales of different products or groups of products which are within the control, and has to divide costs between them for the purposesof the Code.Where such an enterprise:  (a) has made allocations which represent a fair division of costs in its circum-stances, over part or all of the field; and(b) has done so on a consistent basis,it should continue to use this basis for all calculations relevant to the Code.In other cases enterprises may make such allocations by dividing costs in proportion to the value of sales in each area, or on any other basis which represents good accounting practice, provided that it adheres to the chosen basis for all calculations relevant to the Code.Stocks32. In calculating the cost of current production or sales, enterprises may need to include an element for stocks of raw materials, of components or of finished goods, used for production or sales. When making such calculationsin order to arrive at costs per unit of output and at any allowable cost increases, enterprises should adhere to the practice they have followed consistentlyfor the treatment of such costs for pricing purposes.
Transfer Prices33. Where the Price Commission are satisfied that prices, either of purchasesor of sales, which an enterprise proposes to regard as a basis for the calculation of allowable cost increases or of net profit margins, differ from what theywould be if the goods or services had been transferred on an arm&apos;s length basis,they may substitute modified cost increases or profit margins which in theirjudgement fairly reflect what would be appropriate on that basis.Costs of sectors including small enterprises34.  Where the Commission are satisfied that:  (i) significant reductions or increases in allowable costs have occurred or are about to occur in a sector of industry or commerce which includes aconsiderable number of small enterprises, especially those providing services; and(ii) the information available to them indicates that these changes fin costs are likely to be of broadly the same order for a substantial number ofsuch enterprises, in respect either of some or all of the goods or services which they supply,the Commission may calculate average allowable cost increases or reductionsfor the relevant goods or services. In the case of cost increases, these increases should then be taken as the allowable cost increases for the relevant goods or services; in the case of cost reductions, the Commission may specify reductionsunder paragraph 18 in the prices of the relevant goods or services which should then be made by all the enterprises concerned.35. In calculating average allowable cost changes under paragraph 34 theCommission will take account of : (i) all relevant information available to them on cost changes for the goodsor services concerned, including information supplied by any trade association or other body which they consider is representative of the enterprises concerned; and(ii) any other relevant provisions of the Code.36. The Commission will publish information about any average allowable cost changes which they have determined under paragraphs 34 and 35 togetherwith an indication of any price changes which they regard as justified or required under the Code on the basis of those average allowable cost changes.37. Where the allowable cost changes of a particular enterprise differ fromthose published by the Commission under paragraph 36, that enterprise may apply the normal provisions of the Code relating to allowable cost increases or price reductions. It will be the responsibility of the enterprise to satisfy theCommission if required that this was justified.Product Costs and Allowable Cost Increases&quot;Single Product&quot; Enterprises38. Where an enterprise makes a single product or a single range of productsthe calculations required by the Code may be carried out by reference to the costs and prices of that enterprise as a whole.Multi-Product Enterprises: Related Products39. This paragraph applies to enterprises making a variety of products.Where:  (i) allowable cost increases arise on one or more of a range of related products; and(ii) a price increase in respect of them is permissible under the Code, the enterprise need not relate the price increase for individual productswithin the range closely to the cost increase for each product, provided
(a) it has been established practice to treat the range of products in this way;and(b) the average increase in price, weighted by the value of sales in a recentperiod, will not exceed the sum of what the Code would permit on the products affected by the cost increases.40. In cases not covered by paragraphs 38 and 39 the calculations requiredby the Code should be made by reference to individual products.41.   In paragraphs 38, 39 and 40 &quot;products&quot; include services.Anticipation of Cost Increases42. Prices may not be increased in anticipation of cost increases, except as described in paragraphs 43 to 45.  However:  (i) an enterprise may determine and announce a price increase consistent with the Code which takes account of future allowable cost increases which are already known as to both date and amount, provided that theprice increase is not implemented before the allowable cost increases areincurred; and(ii) an enterprise required to pre-notify an intended price increase to theCommission may seek the agreement of the Commission to a price increase consistent with the Code which takes account of such knownfuture cost increases, subject to the same proviso as in (i).43.  Where:-(i) a future allowable cost increase is already known, as to both date and amount; and(ii) it is proposed to quote a price for supply on demand which will notbe increased for at least six months from the date on which it takes effect,an enterprise may average the future allowable cost increase over the periodof not less than six months for which it quotes the price in arriving at a price increase for that period, provided that:  (a) the total amount raised will not be increased by the averaging; and(b) the averaging is in accordance with a well-established practice in the tradeconcerned.44. Paragraph 43 (i) may be read as applying to an estimated future cost increase if:  (i) it relates to a raw material which fluctuates frequently and unpredictablyin price; and(ii) the use of estimates of such cost increases is a well-established practiceof the trade; and(iii) in framing the estimates the enterprise adheres to the methods it has consistently used for the treatment of such costs for pricing purposes.The other conditions of paragraph 43 apply but with references to three monthssubstituted for the references to six months.45. This paragraph applies to tenders to the extent that they are at fixed prices. In framing such tenders, those concerned should have regard to the code, but where tenders are the custom of the trade(i) competitive tenders may provide for estimated future cost increases,(ii) non-competitive tenders may provide for estimated future cost increasesif the contract is to run for at least six months from the date on which work is to begin.Escalation and Variation of Price Clauses46. Where a price increase is made under an escalation or variation of priceclause the productivity deduction specified in paragraph 29 should be appliedto the element relating to labour cost increases, and no price increase should be
made in respect of a labour cost increase which was not consistent with the code. But if the application of the productivity deduction causes or increasesa loss on a particular contract, taken as a whole, the terms of the escalation orvariation of price clauses may be applied to the extent necessary to avoid theloss, or the increase in it. In addition to new contracts, this paragraph applies to existing contracts and to increase in prices under those contracts, to theextent that they relate to cost increases after 6 November 1972.Prime cost and cost reimbursement contracts46A. Where a claim for payment by a contractor under any form of primecost or cost reimbursement arrangement includes an element for increased labourcost levels since the start of the contract or since 6 November 1972, whichever islater, the claim for this element should be made and settled in accordance withthe following provisions : (i) the increases in labour cost levels must have been consistent with the code;(ii) the productivity deduction specified in paragraph 29 must be applied.But if the application of the productivity deduction causes or increases a loss on a particular contract, taken as a whole, the terms of the contract may heapplied to the extent necessary to avoid the loss, or the increase in it. Thisparagraph applies to new and existing contracts. IjDiscounts47. The withdrawal or reduction of a discount, including a discount to aparticular customer, is equivalent for the purposes of the Code to an increasein the price.Quantity or quality change and new products48. A change in the quantity or quality of goods is equivalent for thepurposes of the Code to a change in the price. Quality change in goods or services, quantity change in sales units, or artificial creation of new productsshould not be used as a means of avoiding the requirements of the Code. Wherethe Commission form the opinion that this has been done, they may seek price reductions, or disallow or reduce price increases.48A. However, where a new product is marketed at the retail level on an experimental and restricted basis for a period of not more than six months, theprice charged by the manufacturer need not be treated for the purposes ofthe Code as establishing a price for the product.Losses49. This paragraph applies to enterprises which are making a loss, or are under the Code at risk of doing so:  (i) where an enterprise is making a loss, it may increase prices to cover itscosts;(ii) the provisions relating to allowable cost increases (including the productivity deduction) and to increases in total costs need not beapplied to the extent that they would cause the enterprise to operate at a loss.Price increases may not be made under this paragraph if they cause the profit margin reference level referred to in paragraph 50 to be exceeded.Prices and Profit Margins50. Prices should be determined so as to secure that net profit margins, as defined in paragraph 51, do not exceed the average level of the best two ofthe last five years of account of the unit to which net profit margin control appliesending not later than 30 April 1973 (the &quot;reference level&quot;).
51. &quot;Net profit margin&quot; means the margin of net profit expressed as a percentage of sales or turnover. &quot; Net profit&quot; means the net profit, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied by the enterprise concerned, which arises from trading operations within thecontrol after taking into account all expenses of conducting and financing them,including depreciaton and interest on borrowed money, on the basis set out inparagraphs 25 and 28, but before deducting Corporation Tax or Income Tax.Action where Profit Margin is likely to be exceeded52.   Where:-(i) the reference level has been exceeded; or(ii) in the light of interim accounts or other evidence, the reference level is likely to be exceeded, after taking account of seasonal and otherdistorting factors,abatements in allowable cost increases or price reductions should be made.The abatements or reductions should be sufficient to eliminate the actual oranticipated excess over the reference level as soon as reasonably possible, andto offset any excess which has already arisen in a period subsequent to 30 April1973, though for the purposes of any period before 1 November 1973, the reference level shall be taken to be &quot; the reference level&quot; as described in para-graphs 50, 51 and 53 of the Counter-Inflation (Price and Pay Code Order) 1973.Unit for Profit Margins53. In calculating the net profit margin under paragraph 50, the unit forprofit margin control shall be either : (i) the enterprise as a whole; or(ii) a separate activity, as defined in paragraph 14; or(iii) a unit of the enterprise, being a separate constituent company or sub-division, provided that the Price Commission are satisfied that:(a) the unit reported direct to the main board of the enterprise as a wholebefore 30 April 1973; and(b) it was the practice of the enterprise before 30 April 1973 to treat the unit separately for management and accounting purposes (except where the enterprise has undergone substantial reconstruction since that date); and(c) the accounts of all such units, if combined with one another, can be reconciled with those of the enterprise as a whole; and are not materially distorted by transactions conducted otherwise than onarm&apos;s length terms,provided that the same unit is used for all the purposes in the Code to whichthe net profit margin is relevant.54.  For the purpose of paragraph 53 (i), where the enterprise is a company,(i) &quot; the enterprise as a whole &quot; means the company or (where the company is a member of a group) all the companies in the group; and(ii) &quot; company &quot; includes any body corporate ; and(iii) &quot; group&quot; means the person (including a company) having control of a company together with all companies directly or indirectly controlled byhim but does not include any person or company not carrying on business in the United Kingdom.Allocation of Profits to Controlled Prices55. Allocation of profits between prices within the control and thosewhich are not may be necessary for the calculation of net profit margins.The requirements of paragraph 31 apply to such allocations of profits as theydo to allocations of costs.
Profit Margins and Indirect Taxes56. In making comparisons between net profit margins as a percentageof sales and the reference level, due account must be taken of the effect onmargins of changes in indirect tax on goods and services sold, so that the comparison is not materially distorted. The comparison with earlier years should be made on a basis which excludes purchase tax from sales in theperiod up to the end of March 1973 and excludes VAT from 1 April 1973onwards. Where excise duties have been included in the sales figures, these duties should be included throughout, adjusted as necessary to take account of the partial replacement of excise duties by VAT.57. Where an enterprise does not already have accounts showing separatelythe purchase tax element in the turnover of previous: years, or which permit the precise calculation of the amount of excise duty abatement from records of duty paid,: such elements should be estimated on the basis of the best available information. Where total purchase tax can be ascertained frompurchase invoices this total can be deducted from tax inclusive sales. where such purchase invoices are not available, the purchase tax element may beestimated by applying to the value of purchases of goods charged to different rates of purchase tax appropriate factors derived from those rates.Modified Base Period for Profit Margin Calculation58. Where an enterprise has traded for less than five complete years of account, or has traded at a loss in one or more of the last five years, the reference level for paragraph 50 may be calculated as follows:  (i) if there have been four years of trading, the average of the best two;if three or two years, the best year;(ii) if there have been less than two years of trading the limitation onprofit margins will not apply;(iii) any year in which an enterprise made a loss may be treated as equivalentto a year of no profit and sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) may be appliedaccordingly.59. For a new enterprise formed from a reconstruction or amalgamation of existing enterprises the reference level will be calculated as defined inparagraph 50 by using the aggregate net trading profits of the constituent enter-prises expressed as a percentage of their aggregate sales. The same principlesmay be applied to an amalgamation of partnerships.60. Where the Commission are satisfied that the reference level of an enter-prise, calculated as in paragraphs 50-54, 58 or 59 requires modification, forexample because of a substantial reconstruction of the enterprise during the base period, or a substantial change in the character of its business, they may agree or stipulate a modified reference level which in their judgement gives effectto the principles of paragraphs 50-59 and paragraphs 61 and 62. In applyingthis paragraph the Commission should as far as possible have regard to the profithistory of the main parts of the business which now make up the enterprise;including the profits of any substantial parts of the business acquired or addedto the enterprise during the base period, and excluding any such parts whichhave been disposed of or discontinued.Relief for Low Profits61. Where the Commission are satisfied that the net profit margin calculated as described in paragraphs 50-54, 58 or 59 represents a return on capital of lessthan 8 per cent, the restrictions on price increases by reference to increases in total costs and in allowable costs and on gross percentage and net profit margins need not be applied so as to restrict the return below 8 per cent. Insuch cases the net profit margin which would be needed to produce a return of8 per cent on capital may be treated as the reference level. &quot; Capital&quot; means the net assets employed excluding any part of them which is represented byborrowings the interest on which is deducted in arriving at net profit as defined in paragraph 51.33144118 c
62. At the option of the enterprise paragraph 61 may be read as referring to a net profit margin of 1 per cent on turnover rather than an 8 per centreturn on capital.Investment63. Where the Commission are satisfied that in a particular case it isnecessary in order to encourage or ensure investment to modify the applicationof the limits on allowable cost increases or on profit margins, they may permitsome departure from either or both of those limits. In deciding whether, and towhat extent, to permit such a departure the Commission should have regard tothe following criteria: (i) Whether there is satisfactory evidence that if this done expenditureon the investment will begin within 12 months of the date of the pricebeing increased or the profit margin limit being modified; and(ii) whether(a) the application of the limits would deprive the enterprise of fundsessential for investment which it could not reasonably be expected, or would not be able, to raise in some other way, or would reduce the prospective rate of return on the investment to a level which woulddeter the enterprise from undertaking it; or(b) there is satisfactory evidence that the enterprise had absorbed cost increases to an exceptional degree as a result of voluntary price restraint and in consequence had significantly reduced profit marginsin the 12 months ending 30 September 1972.63A. Where the Price Commission are satisfied that, in the case of an enterprise as defined in paragraphs 53 and 54 whose net tangible fixed assetsexcluding land and buildings per employee exceed  1,000 per head, the capacityutilisation of any plant, accounting for at least 25 per cent of its turnover, was. lessthan 50 per cent at the base date but has since risen to, more than 75 per cent;the Commission may, on application from the enterprise, modify the calculation of allowable and total costs per unit at the base date, by substituting the figuresfor unit costs that in the Commission^ view would have applied at that time if the plant had been operating at 75 per cent of capacity.Particular Sectors64. The paragraphs which follow deal with the application of this Part ofthe Code to certain important sectors. Unless there is express provision to thecontrary in those paragraphs, however, paragraphs 3 to 63A must be taken as applying to all enterprises.Manufacturing and Mining65.   Paragraphs 3 to 63A above apply in their entirety.am qij soiem won iSoiriw naofliaod srtJ la ?,ftr,q nium srii &apos;\o viotzifiDistributionuviiivf  ^nji^j  UOU/, gnlDfuDXy- \juii  .   il SfiJ JjniTiiU ?V.lifJ13Jft3 tjflT OJ66. In the determination of prices for sales within the United Kingdom,wholesalers, retailers and other enterprises engaged in distribution should ensurethat their gross percentage margins do not exceed the level of the gross percentagemargin in either ,(i) the last complete account year of the enterprise ending on or before30 April 1973; or(ii) a 12-month period ending between 30 October 1972 and 30 April 1973for which separate accounts are or can be made available,less in either case an appropriate reduction for the abolition of SET. Where an enterprise has not traded long enough to establish a gross percentage marginunder (i) or (ii), the margin for a complete quarters trading before 30 April1973 will apply.
67. For all the purposes of the Code &quot; gross percentage margin&quot; means the aggregate difference between the cost to the distributor of all the goodshe sells in the home market in a period and the value of his sales of those goodsin that period, expressed as a percentage of the sales value. The differenceshould be calculated according to the normal accounting practice consistentlyapplied by the enterprise. In arriving at sales and costs of sales, indirect taxesshould be treated on the same basis as for calculating net profit margins inparagraph 56.68. The provisions of the Code relating to allowable cost increases do notapply to distribution.Distributors&apos; Stocks69. In most cases prices determined by distributive enterprises will have totake account of the cost of goods used from stock for sale. Such enterprisesshould adhere to the practice they have followed consistently for pricing purposes in arriving at such costs and at the relevant gross percentage margins.Distributors making a loss70. Where an enterprise engaged in distribution is making a loss, it may increase prices to cover its costs, notwithstanding the limitation on gross percentage margins. Price increases may not be made under this paragraphif they cause the profit margin reference level referred to in paragraph 50 tobe exceeded.Action where gross or net percentage margins are likely to be exceeded71. Where a distributor^ net profit margin or gross percentage margin has exceeded the level allowed under this Code, or where in the light of interimaccounts or other evidence that level is likely, after taking account of seasonal or other distorting factors, to be exceeded, price reductions should be made.The reductions should be sufficient to eliminate the actual or anticipated excess over the permitted level as soon as reasonably possible, and to offset any excesswhich has already arisen in a period subsequent to 30 April 1973 (though forthe purposes of any period before 1 November 1973 the reference level shallbe taken to be &quot;the reference level&quot; as described in paragraphs 50, 51 and 53of the Counter-Inflation (Price and Pay Code) Order 1973). Reductions are however not required in respect of any excess arising in the period up to 30April 1973.72. Where in the judgement of the Price Commission the costs of any goods to wholesalers or retailers rise substantially, they shall: (i) consult any body or person whom they regard as representative ofenterprises affected and take into account information supplied bythem; and(ii) having regard to the situation of the product group as a whole and tothe volume of trade, consider whether the maintenance of existing gross percentage margins would disproportionately increase the net profit. margin on those goods; and whether the trade practice affecting themargins on the products in question therefore requires modification; and:   (iii) inform any representative body of the reduction in gross percentagemargin which they consider appropriate, and notify this to any enterprise.Agriculture: 73. Part I of the Code does not apply to agricultural enterprises engagedin the production and sale of unprocessed agricultural produce. Where suchenterprises are engaged in manufacturing or processing, however, their prices are controlled by reference to allowable cost increases and net profit margins. Wherethey are engaged in distribution, their prices are controlled by reference to gross percentage margins and net profit margins.c 2144118
Nationalised Industries74.   Paragraphs 75 to 77 apply to the following nationalised industries: National Coal board electricity CouncilArea Electricity BoardsCentral Electricity Generating board north of Scotland Hydro-Electric board south of Scotland Electricity BoardNorthern Ireland Electricity ServiceBritish Gas corporation british Steel corporation post office British Airways board british Airports authority british Railways.board british Transport Docks board british Waterways Board75. Part I of the Code applies to the nationalised industries listed in para-graph 74, according to the nature of the business of the industry, as it applies to private sector undertakings. However.:  (i) a nationalised industry when in deficit on controlled activities may notapply paragraph 49 (i). In these circumstances it may not increase prices by more than allowable cost increases, calculated without any deductionunder paragraph 29, except to the extent necessary to avoid an increasein its deficit on those activities in the accounting year in question comparedwith the level in 1972-73 or, where it is in accordance with the normalaccounting practice of the industry, in 1972. A nationalised industry may apply this sub-paragraph separately to the deficits of subdivisionsas defined in paragraphs 14 or 53 (iii) even if the industry as a whole isnot in deficit;(ii) as with a private sector enterprise, where an industry is not in deficit,the provisions relating to allowable cost increases and to total cost increases (including the productivity deduction) need not be applied tothe extent that they would cause the industry to operate at a loss;(iii) paragraphs 30A and 61-63A will not apply to a nationalised industry.In (i) and (ii) above, a nationalised industry is in deficit if it incurred a deficit on revenue account in the previous accounting year, after providingfor interest and depreciation calculated in accordance with the accountingprinciples consistently applied by the industry concerned.75A. If the operation of a system of multi-part tariffs in. the gas and elec-tricity supply industries reduces average revenue per unit the following provisions apply. Where since the base date the average revenue per unithas fallen faster than average costs per, unit, tariffs may be increased by theamount necessary to restore the cash margin per unit of output to the level which applied at the base date. Where since the base date the average revenue per unit has fallen but average costs per unit have risen, the permissible increasein tariffs may include an element sufficient to restore average revenue per unitto the base date level in addition to an element calculated on the basis ofallowable cost increases. The calculation of allowable cost increases for these industries should have regard to the likely demand and consumption in the lightof their statutory obligations to meet such demand.76. Where the responsible Minister notifies the Commission that a price increase resulting from the application of paragraph 75 would have an unac-ceptable effect on the general level of prices, the Commission will limit the permitted price increase to the amount specified as acceptable by the Minister,but not so as to reduce the increase below what is needed to reflect the allowable cost increases of the industry.
77. The. application of the Code is subject to paragraph 78 in the case ofthe National Coal Board and the British Steel Corporation. In the case of thePost Office and those industries concerned with air and sea transport, it is subject to, the exclusion from control under paragraph 6 of charges for inter-national traffic. The prices of subsidiary companies of nationalised industries,including subsidiaries of the National Bus Company, National Freight corporation and the Scottish Transport Group, are governed by paragraph 80 (ii). Theprices charged for electricity by Area Electricity Boards and the ScottishBoards will be subject to the provisions of the Code applying to manufacturers.Coal and Steel78. Prices charged by producers for coal, coal-based solid fuels, and mostiron and steel products are outside the scope of the control by virtue ofparagraph 6 (ii). They are subject to international obligations through UnitedKingdom membership of the European Coal and Steel Community. Prices ofnon-ECSC iron and steel products are controlled like those of other manufactured products. Enterprises which produce both ECSC and non-ECSC iron and steel products will be subject to price control on the latter only. Prices of coalmerchants and iron and steel merchants in the United Kingdom will be subjectto the control on gross percentage margins and net profit margins applied towholesaling and retailing enterprises.Other Public Sector Trading Enterprises79. The Commission will apply to proposals for price increases which are referred to them by Government Departments engaged in substantial trading operations the same principles as to proposals by the nationalised industries.80. The Code applies to the prices of the. following enterprises, accordingto the nature of the business of the undertaking, as it applies to the prices ofprivate sector enterprises:  (i) trading services of local authorities, local authority joint boards, publicutility undertakings and other similar public sector undertakings (notbeing a nationalised industry listed in paragraph 74); and(ii) companies registered under the Companies Acts which are wholly or partly owned by Her Majesty&apos;s Government or by a nationalised industry.Water Undertakings81. Statutory water undertakers, whether public or private, are subject tolimitations on deficits, on surpluses or profits, on profit distributions and onborrowing. They are also required by statute to provide an adequate supply ofwater. Their water rates and charges are already controlled to a large extentthrough these limitations. They will be required to comply with the principlesof the Code and in particular. with the paragraphs relating to allowable cost increases, but not so as to conflict with their statutory obligations.Services82. In general, paragraphs 3 to 63 of the Code apply to the prices of service enterprises as they apply to those of manufacturers, so that the system ofallowable cost increases and the limitation on net profit margins as a percentageof sales or turnover apply to them. There will be an offset to allowable cost increases as a result of the abolition of Selective Employment Tax for service enterprises where this has hitherto been paid without refund. Paragraphs 34to 36 permit the Price Commission to calculate average allowable cost changesfor certain small service enterprises where the circumstances are appropriate.
Paragraph 62 would permit service enterprises with low profits to calculate their reference level for the limit on net profit margins by reference either to turnoveror capital employed. The following paragraphs deal with the application of the code to some particular service sectors, and explain any modifications of thegeneral principles which apply to them.Banks, Finance Houses and Similar Enterprises83. Most banks, finance houses and similar financial enterprises are engaged;partly in business for which the charge is a rate of interest and partly business for which the charge is of a different nature. Interest charges are not within thecontrol. The other charges of these enterprises are subject to control. It will therefore be necessary to allocate costs and profits between the two classes ofbusiness for the purpose of the control on non-interest charges. Paragraph 31applies.84. For the purposes of the Code the enterprises described in paragraph 83may treat as goods and services exported:  (i) transactions in sterling with any person or body corporate resident outsidethe United Kingdom ; and(ii) dealings in foreign currencies.85. The provisions of the Code relating to allowable cost increases andto the limitation on net profit margins, defined in the case of these enterprisesas in paragraphs 87 and 88, apply to their non-interest charges. These includecommissions, fees and all similar charges. Where ad valorem rates are chargedand these rates are charged generally, they must be treated as maxima.Enterprises will, however, be free to adjust their rates to match the creditstatus of a client provided such adjustments are in accordance with normal practice in such cases. In calculating charges these enterprises should take fully into account all factors including customers&apos; balances which enter the costing of the class of transaction for which the charge is made. They should treatchanges in those factors as the basis for increases or reductions in the charges in accordance with the Code.86. The provisions of the Code will apply in full to charges in hire purchase, conditional sale and plant and machinery leasing agreements. Changesin the monthly Finance Houses Base Rate may be taken as the measure of increases or reductions in interest costs for the calculation of allowable cost increases, provided that rate is used consistently for all the purposes of the code.87.   For the purposes of paragraph 50 &quot; net profit margin &quot; means: -(i) in the case of enterprises undertaking hire purchase, conditional sale or plant and machinery leasing contracts, where either the greater partof the business of the enterprise consists of such contracts, or separateaccounts can be produced for such contracts, net income from charges for this business less associated costs, including overheads, expressed as a proportion of average resources employed.(ii) in the case of all other enterprises of the kind described in paragraph83 net income from charges (that is, gross income less costs, includingassociated overheads) expressed as a percentage of gross income (that is,total income from the transactions concerned).88. In comparing net profit margins, as defined in paragraph 87, with the reference level, account should be taken of the total profitability of the non-interest business of the enterprise concerned in determining the permitted levelof charges.Construction89. In determining prices for construction contracts enterprises should haveregard to the Code as it applies to manufacturing enterprises.   Of particular
relevance to construction are paragraph 45, which applies to tenders for con-struction work to the extent that they are at fixed prices, paragraph 46, which applies to variation of price clauses in construction contracts and paragraph 46A,which applies to prime cost and cost reimbursement arrangements.Transport90. The Code applies to transport undertakings ais it does to other service enterprises. Charges for international freight and passenger traffic are outsidethe control under paragraph 6 (vi). Charges of nationalised transport under-takings, passenger transport authorities, local authority transport undertakings and transport companies owned by nationalised industries and their subsidiariesare governed by paragraphs 74-77 and 80.91. Charges of private road haulage undertakings are subject to theprovisions relating to allowable cost increases and to the limitations on net profit margins.Vehicle Sales and Services92. Charges for repair, maintenance and servicing of vehicles are subjectto the provisions relating to allowable cost increases and to the limitation on net profit margins. The prices of vehicles sold by distributors, whethernew or second-hand, are subject to the limitations on gross percentage marginsand on net profit margins. Paragraph 14 applies to enterprises, which bothsell&apos; and maintain vehicles.Hotels and Catering Enterprises93. What is said in paragraph 82 applies to these enterprises also, inrespect both of charges for food and drink and for accommodation.Professional or other Services94. Fees and charges for professional or other services by firms or by individuals who are self-employed are governed as prices by Part I. In general,what is said in paragraph 82 applies to them. The pay of professional staff who are employees is however governed by Part II, as is the remuneration from public funds of doctors and dentists.95. Where scales or rates of charges of general application, whethercalculated per item!, at an hourly rate or ad valorem, are in use in a professionunder instructions or advice issued by a professional organisation, those scalesor rates must be treated as maxima and may not be increased without theagreement of the Commission. Where rates above scale have normally beenagreed and have become normal charges, such rates need not be reduced butthe margin by which such rates exceed the scale may not be increased. TheCommission will apply the provisions relating to allowable cost increases to increases in scales or rates and those provisions will also apply to increases infees calculated on a time basis.96. Where there are no scales or rates of general application, the rates orscales charged for a professional service may not be increased except to reflectincreases in allowable costs. Increases in labour costs under paragraph 25 (ii) (a)may not include any element in respect of proprietors&apos; or partners&apos;, as distinct from employees&apos;, time.97. The limitation on net profit margins will apply to profits of firms or individuals providing professional or other services irrespective of themethod by which fees are determined. Where the number of partners in a professional practice has changed as a result of the substitution of a partnerfor an employee, or of an employee for a partner, the reference level may berecalculated by reference to the changed number of partners. Paragraph 59applies to amalgamations of partnerships. In applying the provisions relatingto allowable cost increases to scales or rates of charges, the Commission will haveregard to profit margins in the profession generally and will apply paragraph 52as necessary.
Non-Profit-making Organisations98.  Subscriptions charged by organisations which:  (i) exist for religious, charitable, educational, representational or recreationalpurposes; and(ii) are non-profit-making; and(iii) do not carry on a trade or business as their main activity, will not be controlled.99. The Code will not apply to prices charged by an organisation satisfying the tests in paragraph 98, or by any properly authorised person acting onbehalf of that organisation, if they are charged in order to raise funds for thepurposes of the organisation, and involve no substantial or continuing corn-petition with trading enterprises.100. Except where they are outside the control under paragraph 99, prices charged in any trading activity carried on by an organisation which meets therequirements of paragraph 98 are governed by the Code, unless the customersof the trading activity are confined to members of the organisation.Transitional provision100A. Where an increase in a price or charge was implemented while the code set out in the Counter-Inflation (Price and Pay Code) Order 1973 was inforce and was not permissible under that Code, the price or charge in question should be reduced to the level that would have been permitted under that Code,and this lower price should then be taken as the &quot; selling price at the base date &quot;in calculating any price increase permitted under paragraph 21 of this Code onaccount of subsequent cost increases.Part II-pay general Principles101.   The general principles relating to pay are: :.(i) to limit the rate of increase in pay in money terms to a level more in line with the growth of national output, so as progressively to reduce the rateof cost and price inflation and improve the prospects of sustained faster growth in real earnings;(ii) to apply the limit fairly, irrespective of the form of any increase or the methodof determining it, while providing for the remedying of anomalies;(iii) to facilitate an improvement in the relative position of the low paid;(iv) to leave to those who normally determine pay decisions on the amount,form and distribution of increases within the limit;(v) to encourage the better use of productive resources.Field of Application102.   Part II of the Code applies to:  (i) all pay including wages and salaries at whatever level, allowances, pay-ments by results, payments in kind, fringe benefits and lump sums;(ii) all methods of determining pay whether at national, local, plant or anyother level; and whether determined by collective bargaining, by arbitra-tion, by statutory wage fixing bodies, on an individual basis, or by other means; and(iii) all types of employment (except self-employment covered in Part I); andto both full-time and part-time employees in whatever size of under-taking.All those concerned with the determination of pay should have regard to.the code.
103. Throughout the Code &quot;pay&quot; means remuneration (except self-employ-ment incomes covered in Part I), including other terms and conditions ofemployment.104. References throughout the Code to &quot;settlement&quot; include references tothe determination of pay by any method.105. Where the Code refers to a group, the group will normally be the sameas that used for the purpose of determining pay in the preceding 12 months. Itwill, however, remain open to those concerned to vary the composition of theirgroups. Where pay is fixed on an individual basis, the Code applies to theindividual as to the group.Intervals between Increases106. No group may receive an increase in pay under a settlement made after 6 November 1972 less than 12 months after the group last received a principal increase.107.   Paragraph 106 does not apply where:  (i) an earlier date for such an increase was specified (other than by referenceto changes in indices or rates of pay for other groups) in a previoussettlement made before 6 November 1972; or(ii) the last increase was deferred as a result of the standstill under theWhite Paper (Cmnd. 5125), in which case the 12 months may countfrom the date from which the last increase would have operated but forthe standstill;(iii) the increase does not count against the pay limit or is covered byparagraphs 121A and 121B (flexibility margin). (Increases under para-graphs 121B (flexibility margin), 149B (new efficiency payments schemes)and 152E (certain anomalies) are, however, subject to special rulesabout timing.)108. Pay increases which consist solely of one or more improvements ofthe kind described in paragraphs 123 (equal pay), 125 (hours), 127 (holidays),149A (efficiency payments schemes) or 152C (anomalies) are not principalincreases for the purpose of paragraph 106.The Pay Limit109. The pay limit for a group represents the maximum amount by whichthe average pay bill per head of the group may be increased in a 12-month period. This amount is either 7 per cent of the average pay bill per head of thegroup for the preceding 12-month period or  2-25 per week per head.Negotiators and others concerned with pay determination may choose which of these limits to apply to the group.109A. Where before 6 November 1972 a group has regularly received by automaticapplication and without further negotiation, the same absolute amount or the same percentage increase as one other clearly identified group, it may receive (in place of any increase which counts against the pay limit in its case) the same absolute or percentage increase as that other group receive under the provisions of this Code within the pay limit.109B. A precise method of calculation is set out in paragraph 117. Ifinsufficient information is available for this, the best available alternative methodshould be used; examples are given in paragraph 118. Those concerned will beresponsible for satisfying the Pay Board, if required, that the method used is thebest available.110. Subject to the individual limit in paragraph 121, it will be fornegotiators and others concerned with pay determination to decide on the amount and distribution of increases within the pay limit, and on the division betweenincreases in wages or salaries and improvements in other conditions of service.They should, however, have full regard to the objective of improving the relative position of the low paid.
111. The pay limit applies to the 12 months following the first increase after November 1973 which counts against the pay limit.112. The pay limit applies to the total of all pay increases for the group,other than those specifically exempted by other paragraphs of this Code, inrespect of the 12-month period in question, irrespective of whether they are paidduring that period or at a later date.,113. No payment should be made after 6 November 1973 in respect ofperiods before that date if the effect would be to circumvent the requirementsof the the White Papers Cmnd. 5125 (A Programme for Controlling Inflation:The First Stage), Cmnd. &quot;5205 (The Programme for Controlling Inflation : TheSecond Stage), and The Counter-Inflation (Price and Pay Code) Order 1973.Any such payments will count against the pay limit to the extent that they havenot already been offset against the pay limit applying in the period before7 November 1973.114.   In calculating the average pay bill per head;(i) the number in the group should be taken as the average over the preceding -ing 12 months;(ii) the pay bill should include the cost of all forms of pay, increases inwhich count against the pay limit, and should be adjusted to offset theeffect of absences from work due to absenteeism, sickness, short time working or to stoppages from any other cause.(iii) Part-time workers should be counted according to the proportion which their hours bear to the standard hours of the group. (They shouldbe counted on the same basis in calculating the sum of  2 &quot;25 per weekper head of the group.)115. Employers&apos; contributions in respect of their employees for national insurance, selective employment tax, pensions schemes and redundancy pay-ment schemes and (subject to paragraphs 119 and 120) the cost of overtimehours actually worked should be excluded from the pay bill and increases in them will not count against the pay limit.116. Subject only to the exceptions specified in the Code, the cost of allincreases in pay, including improvements in terms and conditions of employmentother than wages and salaries, must be taken into account in determining whether the total cost of a settlement is within the pay limit.Calculation of the Pay Limit1 117. A precise calculation of the pay limit of 7 per cent should be madeas follows:(i) determine under paragraph 105 the group to be covered by the settle-ment;(ii) ascertain the total pay bill for that group over the 12 months preceding the operative date;(iii) deduct payments for non-contractual overtime working, and employers&apos;contributions in respect of their employees for pensions and redundancy payments schemes, national insurance and SET; and adjust to offset the effect of absences from work;(iv) divide by the average number of workers in the group over the 12 monthspreceding the operative date.This gives the average pay bill per head over the previous year, less overtime.Next:(v) take 7 per cent of that and divide by 52 for a weekly basis or 12 fora monthly basis.This gives the maximum increase in the weekly or monthly pay bill per head allowablewithin the pay limit for the group for the next 12 months.
118. It may not always be necessary to carry out this calculation in full.For example:(i) where rates of pay are equal, or nearly equal, to earnings (excludingovertime), it may be convenient to calculate the pay limit by adding7 per cent or  2*25 to rates. The cost of any other improvements in pay which count against the pay limit would then need to be calculated separately and the new rate reduced commensurately;(ii) in other cases it may be possible to base the calculation on a typicalsample period of e.g. one month or one quarter or on typical sampleperiods for different parts of the year.118A. Where the alternative pay limit of  2-25 per head is chosen the maximumincrease in the weekly pay bill allowable within the pay limit for the group is calculatedsimply by multiplying  2-25Jbyj[tIie number currently in the group.118B. The rate of remuneration for occasional work which does notoccupy any individual for more than the equivalent of 30. days a year maybe increased outside the pay limit by up to 7 per cent applied at an annual rate to the period since the rate was last increased, up to a maximum ofof three years.Overtime, Shift, Night, Rest Day and Weekend Working119. All payments for work done in normal working hours within the meaning of Schedule 2 to the Contracts of Employment Act 1972 (which broadly includes anyhours paid at overtime rates which the employee is required to work under the termsof his contract) should be included in the pay bill. The effect on such payments of any improvement in pay will count against the pay limit, save as provided inparagraphs 120A to 120D below.120. If there is any widening of the percentage differential between the rate of pay for work done outside normal working hours (for example overtime, rest day orweekend working) and the effective rate of pay for standard hours (for example, if the overtime multiplier is increased from time-and-a-third to time-and-a-half), theadditional cost will count against the pay limit, save as provided in paragraphs 120Ato 120D below. For this purpose standard working hours are those recognised either by collective agreement or by custom and practice as being those beyond which overtimepayments at premium rates are made. In calculating the cost it should be assumed that the amount of such working in the 12 months from the operative date of thesettlement will be at least as much as in the preceding 12 months.120A. Premium rates for time worked between certain hours and at weekends may,however, be introduced or increased outside the pay limit with effect from the date of a principal increase for the group concerned subject to paragraphs 120B, C and D.Payments or increases under paragraphs 120B and 120C may not be added to basic rates on which overtime is calculated.120B. Premium payments (other than overtime payments) may be introduced or increased outside the pay limit for any hours worked on Saturday or Sunday or between8 p.m. and 6 a.m. on other days subject to the conditions in paragraph 120D and providedthat:-(i) the hours in question do not attract overtime payments at premium rates forthe workers concerned;(ii) those concerned have standard working hours as defined in paragraph 120,spread over a six or seven-day week; or work on shifts involving regular weekendrostering as part of their standard working hours; and(iii) the average hourly rate of premium payment, including the new or increasedpayments, in each of the periods mentioned above, does not exceed the equivalent of one-fifth of the appropriate basic time rate for hours outside such periods for the workers concerned.120C. Premium payments for any hours worked between 8 p.m. and 6 a.in. on anyday including Saturday and Sunday may be introduced or increased (additional to anyovertime payable) subject to the conditions in paragraph 120D and provided that the

It may not always be necessary to carry out this calculation in full.For example:(i) where rates of pay are equal, or nearly equal, to earnings (excludingovertime), it may be convenient to calculate the pay limit by adding7 per cent or  2*25 to rates.

Ail payments for work done in normal working hours within the meaning of Schedule 2 to the Contracts of Employment Act 1972 (which broadly includes anyhours paid at overtime rates which the employee is required to work under the termsof his contract) should be included in the pay bill. The effect on such payments of any improvement in pay will count against the pay limit, save as provided inparagraphs 120A to 120D below.120.

average hourly rate of premium payment (including the new or increased payments but excluding premium payments for overtime) does not exceed the equivalent of one-fifth of the appropriate basic time rate for hours outside such periods for the workers concerned.120D. For the purpose of calculating the payment or increase permissible underparagraphs 120B and 120C:-(i) all existing premia (including shift premia but in cases falling under paragraph 120C excluding overtime premia) payable in respect of the qualifying hours must be included in calculating the average hourly rateof premium payment, whether they are separately identified or havebeen consolidated into basic rates since 6 November 1972.(ii) Where an existing shift premium covers work outside as well as within the qualifying hours, or where a variable premium is paid for hours within the qualifying hours, the existing hourly premium should be calculated by dividing the total premia by the number of qualifying hours involved.Individual Pay Limit121. Increases subject to the pay limit should not exceed  350 a year forany individual. If the individual works part time this limit should be reducedaccording to the proportion his hours bear to the standard hours of the group.The following do not count against the  350 individual pay limit: (i) increases which do not count against the pay limit for the group ; and(ii) increases contained within the flexibility margin in paragraph 121A unless these take the form of personal increments not covered by paragraph 129.Flexibility Margin121 A. Where the terms of a settlement include one or more of the features specifiedbelow, the pay limit applicable to the settlement may be increased by 1 per cent of theaverage pay bill per head of the group covered by the settlement for the preceding12-month period or by the cost of such features whichever is the less. Groups whichare separate for the purposes of paragraph 109 may be combined for this purpose. Thefeatures are: (i) changes in pay or grading structures or in systems of payment designed to remedyanomalies or secure specific improvements in efficiency;(ii) improvements in holidays which count against the pay limit where this wouldnot increase the total holidays for the group concerned (subject to the sameexclusions as in paragraph 127) to more than the equivalent of four weeks ayear; the cost of such improvements to be calculated as in paragraph 128;(iii) the introduction or improvement of holiday pay;(iv) the introduction or improvement of sick pay schemes.121B. The changes or improvements referred to in paragraph 121A may not be implemented with effect from an earlier date than the first principal increase after thecoming into operation of this Code for those benefiting under the settlement, unless theyimplement in whole or in part a settlement reached before 1 April 1973, and the costdoes not exceed the 1 per cent margin.Other Improvements in Pay and ConditionsEqual Pay122. Orderly progress towards achievement of the requirements of the equal pay Act 1970 may be made outside the pay limit on the basis set out in para-graphs 123 and 124.123. Subject to paragraph 124 an increase for this purpose is outside the pay limit to the extent that by the end of 1974 it reduces by up to one-half: (i) any differential between men&apos;s and women&apos;s rates which existed at 7 November1973 relating to work of the same or broadly similar nature and which isrequired by the Equal Pay Act to be eliminated by 29 December 1975; or
(ii) any differential between women&apos;s rates existing at 7 November 1973 and the pay for the grade in which they are placed by job evaluation complying with thefollowing criteria: (a) the method of job evaluation used and the rules of application are specifiedin writing and have been agreed in advance with the employees concernedor their representatives;(b) the rules specify the form of job description to be used as the basis forevaluation; provide for the evaluation within an agreed specified periodof all new jobs within the area covered by the scheme, and for the re-evaluationof changed jobs within a similar period; and provide for appeals by employees against values given to their jobs;(c) the process of evaluation is distinct from the related process of determiningpay.124. No increase outside the pay limit is allowable under paragraph 123 if anyother increase affecting the group concerned has the effect of widening in percentage terms the differentials to which paragraph 123 refers.obiKhio novig s\ vitrn vrjitidteaoqtsi inluirtii. fliiw oUnuBusmmloo ^ntnoiA; &apos;.\t.i:Hours;/ saoriw.

Reductions in standard working hours may be made outside the pay limitif they reduce standard working hours to not less than 40 hours a week, net of mealbreaks.  This does not apply where standard working hours have at any time been increased by agreement to more than 40 a week.126. Reductions in standard working hours other than as provided for inparagraph 125 count against the pay limit. The true cost should be set againstthe pay limit but the cost should not be treated as less than proportional to thereduction (so that for example a reduction of one hour in 40 should be treatedas equivalent to not less than a 24- per cent increase in pay) except where theBoard is satisfied in the light of the evidence that the true cost is less.Holidays127. Improvements in holidays do not count against the pay limit unless theyincrease the total holidays for any group to more than the equivalent of threeweeks a year excluding:  (i) up to seven occasional or public holidays;(ii) rest days taken in lieu of weekends and overtime;(iii) rest days granted before 6 November 1972 in lieu of a shorter working week.127A. The cost of the additional holiday on 1 January (or an alternativeday in Scotland) does not count against the pay limit.128. Improvements in holidays other than as provided for in paragraph 127count against the pay limit. The true cost should be set against the pay limit but thecost should not be treated as less than proportional to the increase (so that for examplean increase of one day per year should be treated as equivalent to not less than a 0 4 percent increase in pay) except where the Pay Board is satisfied in the light of the evidencethat the true cost is less.Personal Increments129.   Except as in paragraph 130, where personal increments:  (i) are part of a pre-determined range or scale; and(ii) conform to defined principles and practice which before 6 November1972 governed the exercise of any management discretion in individual cases; and(iii) do not exceed those paid in similar circumstances in previous years bymore than results directly from any improvement to the range or scale which has been made within the pay limit and counted against it,
any net addition to the annual pay bill per head. for the group concerned willnot count against the pay limit. Increments which satisfy these conditions donot count against the limit of  350 a year for the individual.130. The following count against the pay limit and against the individuallimit of  350 :-(i) improvements in the ranges or scales in incremental systems covered by paragraph 129;(ii) any net addition to the annual pay bill of a group resulting from thepayment of types of personal increment other than those in paragraph129; and(iii) any element in personal increments which relates to factors not personalto the individual concerned, such as cost of living increases or companyprofits (other than under a profit-sharing scheme as it existed before November 1972).Promotion and Regrading131. Increases commensurate with greater responsibility may be given outsidethe pay limit to individuals who are promoted or the level of whose work isreassessed by the application of procedures and criteria established before November 1972. Where this test is not satisfied any increase in pay countsagainst the. pay limit and against the individual limit of  350. Artificialregrading and changes of job specification should not be used as a means of avoiding the provisions of the Code.Recruitment and New Work132. New recruits to existing jobs should not be paid more than those theyreplace or more than the rate paid currently by the employer concerned for thesame job.133. The rate for new work should not be more than the current rate paid for the same or most nearly similar work by the same or other employers. Whererates vary in different localities, the rate paid should not be more than the ratein the same locality.133A. Where before the statutory reorganisation of public services on 1 April 1974(16 May 1975 for local government in Scotland) an individual temporarily undertakeswork appertaining to the establishment and functions of a new authority or authorities which: (i) is additional to and wider in scope than his continuing work with his currentemployer;(ii) involves additional hours (not subject to overtime payment) or additionalresponsibility; and,(iii) continues for a period not less than three months.payment may be made for such work after 6 November 1973, and during the periodconcerned outside the pay limit at rates which do not exceed those allowable for new work in accordance with paragraph 133.Recognised Terms and Conditions134. The cost of increases to meet the purposes of Section 8 of the terms and Conditions of Employment Act 1959, the Road Haulage Wages Act 1938and similar legislation, arid the Fair Wages Resolution of 1946 will not count against the pay limit.Pensions135. New or improved benefits under occupational pension or death benefitschemes which are tax approved, or under comparable schemes not requiringtax approval, and any reimbursement of a corresponding increase in employeecontributions may, unless paragraph 136 applies, be given outside the pay limit.
136. Where a change in a pension scheme has the effect of increasing the pay, net of any pension contribution of a substantial proportion of the group of employees covered by the scheme, that increase counts against the pay limitunless:  (i) a revaluation of the scheme, made in accordance with generally acceptedprinciples for such revaluations, has shown a surplus in respect of thosereceiving the increase, the value of which equals or exceeds theincrease; or(ii) there has been a corresponding reduction in benefits to those receiving the increase; or(iii) the change had been proposed before 6 November 1972.Redundancy Payments137.   New or improved benefits under schemes which(i) provide payments to employees who leave an employer^ service or are redeployed because of redundancy in the circumstances described in (a) and (b) of Section 1 (2) of the Redundancy Payments Act 1965,and . ut.i :       .       .,       ji     it ;((ii) require a minimum of at least 52 weeks continuous service as a condition of such payments,are outside the pay limit, as are benefits which become payable after six monthsof incapacity.Profit-sharing Schemes138. Payments under the written terms of profit-sharing schemes as they stoodon or before 6 November 1972, will not count against the pay limit. Where the termsare not written, payments should not exceed what has customarily been paid. Anyother payments or benefits under such schemes must be counted against the pay limit.Share Option and Share Incentive Schemes139. The provisions of the Code do not apply to the operation of a savings-relatedshare option or share incentive scheme under the scope of Schedule 8 to the Finance Act1973 and approved by the Inland Revenue. In addition if the rate at which options orshares had been acquired by individual participants under a share option or shareincentive scheme operating on or before 6 November 1972, was fixed or relateddirectly, without managerial discretion, to quantified criteria by a pre-determinedformula the operation of that scheme on the terms ruling before that date is outsidethe pay limit.;139A. Except as in paragraph 139 no options may be granted under shareoption schemes or shares issued under share incentive schemes. The terms ofschemes under which shares already issued are still subject to restrictions, oroptions already granted remain unexercised, may not be improved.140. The acquisition of shares through any arrangements, not involvingoptions, by which employers facilitate the purchase of shares by employees is outside the pay limit provided that:(i) the shares are purchased at a price equal to their market value (themarket value being assessed without regard to any restrictions attachedto the shares, or to the employee^ rights as a shareholder, which do notattach, to all shares of the same class, or to the rights of all shareholders);and    ,/&apos;&quot;   i i ,   j,   J , (     ,, i-a     t   ,rni,(ii) there are no related loans or deferred payment arrangements.Other Benefits141. The cost of any new benefits and of any improvement or extensionof existing benefits or other terms and conditions of service will count againstthe pay limit unless otherwise exempted in the Code.   These benefits include :Benefits in cash or kind, including the provision of cars partly or whollyfor private use, living accommodation at less than economic cost, etc.
Loans at below market rate, e.g. for house purchaseLunch or other meal vouchersSeasonal and holiday bonusesResponsibility allowancesGeographical allowances other than London allowances covered by paragraph 141AOvertime and shift premiaStand-by paymentsLay off and sick pay141 A. Improvements to an allowance or differential rate of pay designed to compensate for the additional cost of accommodation and travel in London comparedwith the rest of the country may be increased outside the pay limit provided that the allowance or differential was being paid on or before 6 November 1972, on the basisof the formula given in Cmnd. 3436 (NBPI Report No. 44 of 1967) and that any increase is made on the same basis. Improvements to police pay differentials for London maybe made outside the pay limit on the basis of the same formula.142. Re-imbursement to an employee of the following expenses does not count against the pay limit: (ii)(i) expenses incurred in the performance of the duties on which he is employed;(ii) expenses incurred in a removal of his home which is necessary for the purposeof his transfer by his employer;(iii) the recurrent costs of providing himself with unfurnished living accommo-dation in a location subject to the direction or consent of the employer, where such reimbursement is made in accordance with procedures, criteria and standardsunder conditions of service established on or before 6 November 1972 (but excluding conditions of service providing for direct reimbursement of interest charges).When these expenses are reimbursed by fixed allowances these may be increasedoutside the pay limit, provided that the increase can be fully justified by reference to the relevant costs.Particular Methods and Systems of PaymentNational, Local and Plant Increases143. Where settlements or pay determinations for a particular group are concluded at more than one level (for example a settlement at national or industrylevel is supplemented by settlements at local or plant level) the pay limit will apply for the 12 months beginning with the first increase since 6 November 1972 which countsagainst the pay limit. The maximum increase in the weekly or monthly pay bill per head allowable within the pay limit for the group for that 12 months should be as inparagraph 117.  Paragraph 106 applies separately to each level of settlement.144. When local or plant negotiations take place before national negotiations the recommended method of achieving the purpose of paragraph 143 is by including in the local or plant settlements an off-setting provision precluding employers from making subsequent payments as a result of a national agreement which would resultin a total increase in the pay of the group concerned in excess of the pay limit. Thoseundertaking national negotiations should have regard to the requirement that any increase settled nationally if not offset as above should be taken into account in any subsequent local or plant negotiation so as to ensure that the maximum increase in the weekly or monthly pay bill per head of any group concerned does not exceed the pay limit for that group.Efficiency Payments (including Payment by Results) and Restructuring Schemes145. Except where specific provision is made in paragraphs 146-149Bincreases in pay under efficiency payments (including payment by results) andrestructuring schemes will count against the pay limit.   In the case of payment
by results schemes this applies to increased payments arising from changes inbase rate, conversion rate or other calculator, piecework prices or times, the fixed element or from any other changes in the terms.Existing Schemes146. Increases in pay under a scheme of payment by results, including pieceworkand commission payments, or under an arrangement linked to such a scheme will not count against the pay limit where they arise, under the terms of a scheme which was inoperation before 6 November 1972 or brought into operation under the provisions ofparagraph 149, from the direct and measurable contributions by the employees to increased output. After 1 July 1974, this provision will apply only where the operationof the scheme is kept under review by the control information specified in paragraph149A (vi).147. For those covered by schemes of payment by results, who do not benefit from a general pay increase, the 12-month period referred to in paragraph 109 will bethe 12 months from I April in any year.148. For those covered by schemes of payment by results who also benefit from a general increase which counts against the pay limit, account must betaken in calculating the amount available for the general increase of any increase under the scheme which counts against the pay limit. For this purpose it mustbe assumed that increases in pay which count against the pay limit arising underthe scheme during the 12 months following the general increase will be at least as great in percentage terms as in the preceding 12 months.Programmes agreed and partially implemented before 6 November 1972.149.  Where :-(i) there was on 6 November, 1972, an agreement to implement a programmeof productivity (including payment by results) schemes, or a restructuring,for specified groups of employees in which the amount of pay or the precise method by which it was to be calculated was clearly specified,leaving only the practical details of application of the scheme to particular groups to be settled; and(ii) the employer or group of employers covered by the agreement had on6 November, 1972, already implemented the programme in respect ofsome of the employees concerned,implementation of the programme in respect of the specified groups may proceed.Resultant increases in pay will not count against the pay limit, provided those arisingfrom payment by results schemes meet the requirement of paragraph 146.New Schemes149A. Increases in pay resulting from a new efficiency payment scheme or arestructuring scheme will not count against the pay limit provided that thescheme meets the following criteria: (i) after meeting all costs and charges incurred by the employer in installingthe scheme (including increased capital charges determined in accordancewith generally accepted accounting principles consistently employed byhim and pay increases to all employees benefiting from the scheme,whether directly or consequentially), the net savings arising from thescheme are,(a) sufficient to reduce total costs per unit of output and labour costs per unit of output below the level they would be but for the intro-duction of the scheme, and(6) at least equal to the cost of the pay increases under the scheme;(ii) the Pay Board is informed before the scheme is brought into operation;(iii) no increase is payable before the net savings have been achieved and in any casenot until after the results of the first three months running of the scheme havebeen submitted to the Pay Board for checking and the Board&apos;s approval givenfor payment to be made with effect from the date of operation of the scheme;49144118 d
(iv) the additional payments under the scheme do not exceed 50 per cent of theincrease which is allowable within the pay limit to those benefiting from thescheme;(v) the additional payments under the scheme are to be correspondingly reduced ifstandards or targets specified in the scheme are not met;(vi) the operation of the scheme is kept under review through regular man-encouragement  control information. The control information must, as aminimum, clearly indicate changes in output per man hour, earnings,labour costs per unit of output and total costs per unit of outputrelative to a typical earlier reference period and must ensure that output for payment purposes is correctly recorded;(vii) the scheme is based on properly measured work standards or targets, notmerely on past performance, and these standards or targets where appropriate: (a) take account of the improvement in performance which experience of doing aparticular job brings; and(6) are regularly checked and revised when methods change to ensure thatconsistency is maintained.149B. A new scheme which satisfies the provisions of paragraph 149A maybe brought into operation only with effect from the same date as the firstprincipal increase after 7 November 1973 for those benefiting directly fromthe scheme, unless that date is 1 July 1974 or earlier in which case the scheme may be brought into operation on any date after 31 December 1973.Settlements reached before 6 November 1972150... Settlements reached, but not implemented, on or before 6 November 1972,which provide for specified increases on specified dates on or after 7 November 1973(and not by reference to changes in indices or other rates of pay) may be implemented in full from their due date or dates. They will count against the pay limit unless theyare increases of a kind which do not count against the pay limit under other paragraphs of this Code.151. In the case of an increase under a settlement of the kind referred toin paragraph 150 the pay limit will apply to the 12 months following thatincrease, except where the increase falls within the period of a previous pay limit for the group and is counted against it. Where the total cost of thesettlement within that 12 months equals or exceeds the pay limit it may not beadded to, unless in ways which do not count against the pay limit.New Long-term Agreements152. Settlements may be made providing for staged increases at not lessthan 12-month intervals which are consistent with the Code but implementation of the later stages will be subject to the provisions of the Code at the time.152A. Any increase may be paid which could, consistently with the requirc-ments of the Counter-Inflation (Price and Pay Code) Order 1973, be paid with effect from a date before 7 November 1973.Threshold Agreements152B. Payments under threshold agreements may be made outside the pay limit andwill not count against the individual pay limit provided the following conditions aresatisfied: (i) the base figure for the purpose of the agreement is the Retail Price Index(RPI) figure for October 1973;(ii) the agreement runs for not more than 12 months&apos;from the date of publicationof the RPI figure for October 1973;
(iii) after the date of publication of the RFI figure which is 7 per cent abovethe base figure for the purpose of the agreement, a pay increase of notmore than 40p a week is given, with a further increase of not more than40p a week for every subsequent full 1 per cent rise in the RPI duringthe currency of the agreement;(iv) payments are treated as special supplements on an individual basis and are not included in the base rate for overtime or other premia;(v) each payment of up to 40p a week is paid in full only to full-time employees and to part-time employees working 21 hours or more a week pro rata.Anomalies152C. Subject in all cases to approval by the Pay Board, increases may be givenoutside the pay limit as necessary in order to correct anomalies satisfying the relevantcriteria set out in paragraphs 152D, 152F, 152G or 152H. Such increases may bebackdated to 7 November 1973 but not earlier.152D.   In order to qualify as an anomaly on the basis of a link: (a) the link must have been broken by the standstill; and(6) but for the standstill, the link must have determined the pay of the group concerned.In order to satisfy this condition:(i) there must be evidence of that link and clear identification of the pay groupbeing followed; and(ii) the effect of the link on the pay of the group concerned must have been known(even if not formally agreed) before 6 November 1972 or have been predictablewithin a narrow range;and where applicable:(iii) where the link is not embodied in a formal agreement and there are separatenegotiations, there must be evidence that all concerned intended that the outcome would be in accordance with (ii).These requirements apply to links both between groups and between grades within thesame or different groups.152E. When a link which meets the conditions in paragraph 152D is restored with a group which had negotiated before the standstill a long-term settlement providing forone or more pay increases or improvements in conditions after the end of the standstill,the linked group may apply such increases or improvements:(i) on 7 November 1973, where they were effective between the end of the stand still and 6 November 1973;(ii) on the operative date of the increase or improvement of the group being followed,where this is later than 6 November 1973.152F.  In order to qualify as an anomaly on the basis of a formal procedure: (a) the formal procedure must have been set aside by the standstill; and(b) but for the standstill the formal procedure must have determined the pay of thegroup concerned.  In order to satisfy this condition: (i) there must be a process agreed between the parties for determining the field of comparisons which cannot be changed during the course of a particularpay review; and(ii) there must be agreed rules governing the translation of external rates intoagreed internal levels of pay such that it is possible to infer the outcomefrom the external evidence within a narrow range. The procedure mustdetermine the actual levels of pay and not merely use outside evidence, forexample published wages or earnings indices, to gauge the size of increases.152G. Where there is a formal procedure, satisfying the conditions in sub-paragraphs152F (b) (i) and (ii) above, which was in operation before the standstill, had a review dateafter the end of the standstill and includes within its current review a period before the standstill, any increase which may be due at the first review following the standstillmay be paid in full on the first due date after 6 November 1973 in place of an increase under paragraph 109.
152H. Where a new anomaly is created when a link or formal procedure is restored in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 152D, 152F or 152G above, the consequential anomaly may also be treated as an anomaly arising from the standstillprovided that it meets conditions (i) to (iii) of paragraph 152D above.1521.  Increases designed to remedy an anomaly must:(i) be limited to what the link or formal procedure would have given if the link orformal procedure had been allowed to operate at the first operative date after November 1972;(ii) take full account of all relevant details of the settlement or procedure being followed and of benefits received by the linked group since 6 November 1972in so far as these are relevant to the benefits accruing from the restoration of the link or formal procedure; and(iii) for those whose basic pay exceeds  5,000 per annum, be staged and paid in twoequal amounts, subject to such modifications as the Pay Board may approvein order to prevent this provision creating serious anomalies in the pay structure of the group concerned. The first payment may be made with effect from a datenot earlier than 7 November 1973, and the second not earlier than 12 monthsafter the first payment.152J. For the purpose of calculating the pay limit for the next increase after the remedy of an anomaly, the calculations required by paragraph 109 may take accountof increases in the pay bill expressed as an annual rate, resulting from the remedy ofthe anomaly.152K. In determining increases remedying anomalies negotiators should haveregard to the objective, set out in paragraph 110, of improving the relative position ofthe low-paid and to the desirability, therefore, of not reversing any redistribution of income from higher paid to lower paid employees resulting from increases since6 November 1972.Part III-General153. Where the particular provisions of the Code cannot be directly appliedto particular cases or sectors without modification, the Price Commission andthe Pay Board will, in exercising their functions, apply those provisions with suchadaptations or modifications as appear to them to be necessary to give effect tothe principles and objectives of the Code.
SECTION IIIDIVIDENDSAdministration and General Principles1. In accordance with the Counter-Inflation Act 1973, dividend control willcontinue to be administered by the Treasury. The provisions of the existingOrder SI 1973/659 will continue to apply except for those changes to which effect will be given by an amending Order to be made by the Treasury underthe Act and which will take effect at the beginning of Stage 3. The following paragraphs incorporate these changes and set out in broad terms the principles which will be observed by the Treasury in the administration of dividend control under Stage 3.The Dividend Limit2. Except as indicated in paragraph 4, a company incorporated in theUnited Kingdom will not be permitted, without the consent of the Treasury, to declare dividends for any account year which exceed by more than 5 per cent the amount of ordinary dividends declared by that company for the precedingaccount year. Other analogous distributions out of the assets of the companywill be prohibited, except with the consent of the Treasury. Fixed rate dividendswill not be subject to control.3. The control of dividends will operate on declarations. Interim dividendswill not require the approval of the Treasury, unless they are likely to exceed thepermissible level for the account year, or to bring total declarations above that level. In general, the control will affect the declaration of final dividends, andfor this purpose declaration normally means the decision taken by shareholders atthe company&apos;s annual general meeting. The Act also gives power to controlpayments of dividends as distinct from declarations should this be necessary.Field of Application4. Dividend control will apply to all companies incorporated in the UnitedKingdom with the exception of:(i) investment trusts as defined in Section 359 of the Income and CorporationTaxes Act 1970;(ii) close companies to the extent that they increase distributions in order tocomply with the special tax rules concerning such companies;(iii) companies entirely in the beneficial ownership of another company or companies (except those in the ownership or part-ownership of an invest-ment trust) or those companies where ordinary dividend payments areexclusively inter-company transactions;(iv) former private or unquoted public companies in respect of the firstaccount year during which they become a quoted company and the succeeding account year;(v) new companies in respect of dividends declared for their first two accountyears.5. The exemption for close companies will apply only to the extent that anincreased distribution is necessary to avoid a shortfall assessment or an apportion-ment of their income. Where an increased distribution is necessary it can bemade at any time within a reasonable period from the end of the relevantaccounting year.6. As during Stage 2 the Order will apply to quoted companies only exceptfor those in the categories mentioned above. Companies other than quotedcompanies will not be covered by the Order.  They will nevertheless be subject
to the same limitations on dividend declarations as quoted companies and willbe expected to comply with them. If necessary, the restrictions will be appliedto individual unquoted companies by means of a notice given under the Act.Calculation of the Dividend Limit7. In computing what dividends may be declared for a company&apos;s accountyear, the starting point will be the total amount of ordinary dividends declaredfor the last account year in respect of which a profit and loss account of thecompany laid before it in general meeting was compiled. The money amount ofthese dividends may then be increased by 5 per cent to give the total amount ofthe ordinary dividends which may be declared for the succeeding companyaccount year.8. The basis of comparison will need to take account of the changes incorporation tax which came into operation on 6 April, 1973. The comparisonwill be between:(i) gross dividends paid before 6 April, 1973; and(ii) franked payments (that is, the aggregate of dividends and such proportionthereof as corresponds to the rate of advance corporation tax in force for the financial year in which the dividend is paid) made after 5 April,1973.The 5 per cent increase applies to the amount of the gross dividend declaredfor the company&apos;s preceding account year.9. Pro rata adjustments should also be made (i) to take account of changes of one month or more in the length of a company&apos;s accounting period; and (ii)where there has been a reduction in the company&apos;s share capital, or where a company&apos;s share capital has increased since the declaration of the final dividend(or its equivalent) for the preceding account year and the increase reflects thevalue of new cash subscribed or other real consideration. Where there has beensuch an increase in share capital the adjustment should be proportionate to theincrease in the number of shares issued; no account should be taken of any sharepremium where the amount or value of the consideration received for the sharesexceeds the nominal value.10. Normal capitalisation issues will not be prohibited by the Order, butan increase in capital which is the result of a capitalisation issue will not rankfor increased dividend.Application to takeovers, increases in share capital, recoveries, etc.11. The Order will empower the Treasury to issue consents to allow com-panies to declare dividends above the level normally permitted. Consents will only be granted in exceptional circumstances, and any application for such treatment must be made in writing to the Treasury well before any relevantboard meeting.12. It is not possible to specify in advance precise rules applicable to allcases. The following paragraphs are not exhaustive but they indicate the broadareas where Treasury discretion is likely to be exercised.Takeover defence13. Where the Treasury are satisfied that an actual takeover bid situationexists (j.e. where it is the bidder&apos;s intention to acquire more than 50 per cent of the voting shares of the company subject to the bid), companies wishing todefend themselves from the bidder by increasing their dividends will normally beallowed to do so.Increases in share capital14. Where the control would otherwise preclude companies from adjustingdividends to take account of new shares issued for real consideration (forexample, deferred shares becoming eligible for dividend for the first time)
and where this would result in a reduction in shareholders&apos; dividend incomecompared with the preceding account year, those companies will normally be permitted to make an appropriate adjustment.Recoveries15. Companies which have recovered from an adverse trading positionwishing to increase their dividends to an earlier more typical level will normally be permitted to do so provided that in the previous 10 years such a level was achieved at least twice by the company in its present form. They will not,however, be allowed the 5 per cent increase on top of this concession.Companies with no previous dividend declaration16. Companies which have never previously declared a dividend will normally be allowed by the Treasury to declare dividends up to two-thirds of those earningsavailable for distribution as ordinary dividend to shareholders arising in thecorresponding account year.Reconstructions, amalgamations, mergers, etc.17. Companies other than those under paragraph 4 (v) and which havebeen the subject of a reconstruction, an amalgamation or merger with existing companies or a reverse takeover, should consult the Treasury if they wish to declare a dividend in excess of the statutory limit.Pre-6 November 1972 commitments18. Dividend forecasts made toy quoted companies before 6 November 1972and contained in a prospectus issued under the rules of the Stock Exchange will normally be allowed to be honoured provided the Treasury are satisfied that a real commitment exists and that all the conditions of the forecast are met.Other dividend forecasts19. Companies wishing to make a forecast or honour a forecast made since6 November, 1972, in connection with an acquisition, rights issue, offer for sale,placing or requotation are advised to consult the Treasury if the dividenddeclaration concerned is in excess of the statutory limit.Minority shareholdings in subsidiaries20. Subsidiary companies where 10 per cent or less of the shares are held by individuals will normally be allowed by the Treasury to qualify as wholly-owned.Printed in England by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office3144118   Dd; 251965  K1200  10/73
