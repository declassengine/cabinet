CUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 90 COPY NO   6710 September 1973CABINETRELOCATION OF DEFENCE FACILITIES FROM SHOEBURYNESSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for defence. At the meeting of the Cabinet on 5 April (CM(73) 22nd Conclusions,,Minute 10) it was agreed that we should await public reaction to the reportof the Committee on Defence Lands (the Nugent Report) before consideringfurther the problem of relocating certain Defence facilities fromShoeburyness.    At that time, the options open to us were to accept therecommendation in the Nugent Report in favour of relocating these facilities at Tain or, if there was widespread opposition to this proposal.,to institute a further independent assessment of the five sites (Tain,West Freugh, castle martin, Pembrey and Lulworth) identified astechnically suitable for the proof and experimental work involved,2.        Apart from the representations made by the Member of Parliament,Mr Hamish Gray, Press and public comments have been less than mighthave been expected.    All the local authorities in the area are opposed tothe proposed extension of range activity at Tain and they are joined in opposition by^he Inver and District Community Association and the DornochFirth Action Group.    The principal reasons for their opposition, as hitherto, are that industrial development in connection with oilexploration has obviated the need for more local employment andenhanced the importance of the Dornoch Firth as an amenity area: thatthe noise of gun firing will cause undue disturbance in the area and thatthe range will interfere with fishing and air navigation.    Thus localopposition has been sustained, but there has been no evidence of more widespread opposition from members of the public or from other groupssuch as has occurred in respect of the recommendations in the NugentReport affecting castle martin and Lulwcrth.    While this fact does not mean that the local opposition at Tain is any less real or heartfelt than thatat castle martin, I consider that some of the grounds for opposition atTain are mis-founded.    There has never been any question of giving up theexisting Air Weapons range so that the amenity facilities in the DornochFirth area might be enhanced;  and the proposed proof and experimental work will in fact cause less noise disturbance than the previously plannedmore extensive use of the range for air weapons trials.
3,.        I. have considered with my colleagues the proposal to arrange foran independent assessment of the  !v8 possible sites.    The results of myexamination are set out in my minute of 19 July to the Prime Minister at annex A,    In my view there is no advantage in instituting an independentassessment which would be unlikely to provide any firmer basis for adecision than the Nugent Report,    Any such assessment would certainly involve further delays in the timetable for the Third London Airport which,as is clear from the paper by the Secretary of State for the Environment(CP(73) 89), has already suffered some slippage,40        If it is agreed that Tain should be chosen without a furtherindependent assessment, it remains to be decided whether a public inqiiiryshould be held into the proposed new use of the existing Air Weapons rangeat Tain.    As all the local authorities have objected to the proposal thenormal arrangement would be to hold a public inquiry.    To do so howeverwould inevitably introduce a further element of delay into the programme for the Third London Airport,    Moreover in the absence of any alternativeoite a public inquiry loses much of its purpose and an adverse result,which v/ould seem very likely to occur, would place us in an even moredifficult position if we had to overrule the findings than would be the case if we made a decision without an inquiry,    A public inquiry at Tain could also provoke demands for further public inquiries at Eskmeals andTy Croes,    In short we shall be criticised if we go ahead without a public inquiry but the criticism may well be just as strong, or even stronger^if we hold an inquiry and then do not accept its findings,5. The arguments for relocating the remaining Defence facilities fromShoeburyness at Tain are set out in the extract at Annex B from theNiigent Report,    I agree with the Committee1 s conclusion.    The Secretaryof State for Scotland has, however, drawn my attention to the heavydemand for building and civil engineering work in Easter Ross, resultingfrom existing North Sea oil developments,    A statement of the position asseen by his Department is attached at Annex C,    My Department has confirmed with the Property Services Agency that their estimate of5-6 years for the construction work involved in relocating the proof and experimental facilities at Tain took these factors into account,6,        I recognise that there is no easy and generally acceptable solution to this problem of relocating the remaining Defence facilities fromShoeburyness so that the Maplin site can be developed within an acceptabletime scale for the Third London Airport.    In the light of all the factorsmentioned in this paper I consider that on balance the least objectionablesolution would be for us to decide that the remaining Defence facilitiesfrom Shoeburyness should be reprovided at Tain and that there should be nolocal inquiry at Tain about this alteration in the use of the existing AirWeapons range.2
7.        I invite the Cabinet to agree with this conclusion,    A decision onthese points will provide a firm basis for the necessary furtherconsideration of how best to present the Governments conclusion on thisparticular recommendation in the Nugent Report,c ministry of Defence10 September 19733f
ANNEX ACOPYPRIME MINISTERRELOCATION OF DEFENCE FACILITIES FROM SHOEBURYNESSAt the meeting of the Cabinet on 5th April (CM(73) 22ndConclusion Minute 10) I was invited to give further considerationto my proposal that, if there were widespread and sustainedopposition to the recommendation in the report of the DefenceLands Committee (the Nugent Report) that certain Defence facilitiesfrom Shoeburyness should be relocated at Tain, we might need toarrange for a further independent assessment of all the arguments in relation to the five possible sites for these facilities,namely Tain, West Freugh, castle martin, Pembrey and Lulworth.2.     I think the Cabinet recognised that, in view of thecontroversial issues involved in the selection of the site forthe relocation of the Defence facilities from Shoeburyness, the composition of, and the procedure adopted by, the body entrusted with this further assessment would need to be seen to beauthoritative and impartial if we were to be able to accept itsrecommendation.   On the other hand, as it was recognised to be equally important to reach an early decision on the relocationsite in order to avoid further delay in the development of thenew Maplin Airport, it was agreed that the elaborate and time-consuming procedures of the Roskill Commission should be avoided.There are difficulties in reconciling these two requirements.3.     Any body, however eminent its composition, which merelycarries out in private a paper review of all the existing argumentsand confirms the recommendation in the Nugent Report that theDefence facilities from Shoeburyness should be relocated at Tainwill be unlikely to convince those opposed to this proposal thattheir widespread and sustained opposition has been seriously andobjectively re-assessed.   Potential objectors to any recommendation by such a body operating in private that Shoeburyness facilities should be relocated at West Freugh, castle martin, Pembrey orLulworth could legitimately claim that they had been denied eventhe opportunity of presenting their case, contrary to the currentpolicy of allowing the public to play a greater part in planningdecisions.    If, therefore, any recommendation resulting fromthis further independent enquiry is to carry sufficient public confidence to justify its acceptance by the Government, the bodyentrusted with the task would need to have at least some of thescope and authority of a Planning Inquiry Commission.A - 1(confidential)
(cENTiAL)U.     The appointment of a Planning Inquiry Commission (PIC) toconsider a number of possible sites would inevitably involvedelays.   On the most optimistic assumptions, a PIC assessment of the five possible sites would take 1U-18 months.    This time-scale could be reduced to about 12 months if an Ad Hoc Panelwere appointed on the lines set out in the Annex to this minute.Thus, any further independent assessment of possible sites forthe relocation of the Defence facilities from Shoeburyness.whichwas likely to carry public confidence would inevitably introduce a further element of delay into the programme for the developmentof the Maplin Airport.5.     In all the circumstances, I have doubts about the wisdom ofpursuing the proposal to institute a further independentassessment which, in the event, might well not produce any firmerbasis for a decision than the recent enquiry by the NugentCommittee.    I suggest therefore that a better course might be forthe Cabinet to review the situation in September in the light ofthe evidence then available of the public reaction to therecommendation in the report of the Nugent Committee.    (At thattime we could also consider whether debates should be arranged in Parliament at the end of October - before the conclusion ofthe current Session - on the Nugent Report; several members have already indicated that they expect to be given an opportunityto express their views before decisions are taken).6.     I am sending copies of this minute to the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary, the Lord President, the Home Secretary,the Secretaries of State for the Environment, for Scotland andfor Wales, and to Sir Burke Trend.C19th July 1975A- 2(confidential)
(confidential) ;&apos;Appendix to Annex AAD HOG PANELAn Ad Hoc Panel would &quot;be a more flexible version of a planning Inquiry Commission (PIC).    The justification for setting up such a Panel rather than a PIC would be that allthe relevant considerations had already been established andthe Panel would be asked merely to look at the five possiblesites already identified.2.     The Panel could be set up before any specific proposal hadbeen the subject of a formal notice in accordance with theprovisions of DOE Circular 80/71  (Welsh Office Circular l6k/71and Scottish Office Circular 131/72) but the procedure of the circular would be followed in respect of whichever site orsites the Panel considered to be worth pursuing.   The number of formal notices might thus be less than those required if a PICwas set up.    The Panel would conduct local enquiries at thosesites which appeared to warrant such action.3.     On the assumption that the Panel might be able to reducethe number of local enquiries to 3 rather than k or 5, the timing would be:-a. Preliminary consideration by Panelb. Formal consultations in accordance with appropriate DOE/Scottish/Welsh Circularsc. Local enquiriesd. Reporting on local enquiriese. Consideration of reports by Panel1-2 months2 months3-4 months2 months2-3 monthsIt would therefore not be realistic to allow less than about a year for this method of enquiry to be completed.    It would involve someor all of the Panel members working full time, at least during the holding of the local enquiries.A - 3(confidential)
(confidential)Annex BRELOCATION OF PROOF AND EXPERIMENTAL ESTABLISHMENT&apos; (P.&amp;E.E),SHOEBURYNESS1.    In our consideration of the sites in the area ofShoeburyness, we have noted that the Government decision to locate the Third London Airport at Foulness will mean thatsome 39,000 acres of Ministry of Defence land must be given up.  During the course of our review, we were invited by theSecretary of State for Defence to advise on an alternativesite for certain of the research and development facilities at the Proof and Experimental Establishment at Shoeburyness.2o    Ministers had already agreed that it v/as essential toreprovide the research and development facilities at presentcarried out on the range at Shoeburyness.   The penalties ofnot doing so are unacceptable, in terms of damage to theproduction and testing of armaments for our own Services, to theexport sales of these armaments, and to our prospects forcollaborative projects.3.    We established that the nature of the research anddevelopment work, apart from the work which is scheduled tobo transferred to other sites, was such that a site for these facilities has to meet exacting topographical and technicalcriteria.   It needs a sea frontage or at least two miles, withsand at low tide,   It has to be reasonably flat.   The landdepth needs to be at least two and a half miles and to allow for flank observation along the trajectory,, continuously for14 miles.  The associated sea danger area (the safety requirements for a range dictate, in practice, the use of a coastal site witha danger area of some 80 square miles) should be clear of majorshipping lanes, fishing and oil exploration areas.   Clear airspace up to 30,000 feet is necessary.  The locality of the siteshould be served, preferably by rail, but if not, by majorroads capable of carrying the heaviest tanks and guns.   the climate should be such that trials work could be carried outmost days of the year, and labour should be available locally.4.    We reviewed the steps taken by the Ministry of defence to find an alternative site (or sites) for the facilities, tomeet these requirements, and learned that the proposal to resiteall the facilities at PELulRWPENDINE had been toned downby the Government, in Auril 1971, following an adverse public inquiry.  Subsequently/an alternative plan v/as consideredb - 1(confidential)
under which all the gun firing facilities would have &quot;been .relocated at WEST FREUG-H to share an existing site with the.A.F. and M.0.D.CP. E.), with the static (non gun-firing)facilities going to SPADEADAM in Cumberland.   However, further examination showed that the proposals for West Freugh wereimpracticable.5.    At this stage, after an examination of sites in all partsof the United Kingdom, it was agreed that the gun-firingfacilities would be dispersed to a number of locations asfollows:   the main research and development tasks to TAIN;   two other research and development tasks to KIRKCUDBRIGHT;   andthe general proof work to be divided between&quot;ESIQviEALS inCumberland and ABERFFRAU (TY CEDES) in Anglesey.   These dis-positions would result in the acquisition, or acquisition of rights over, some 1,300 acres;   but the release of land bythe Ministry of Defence would be far greater - some 8,000 acresat Shoeburyness, with a coastline of nearly 10 miles, as wellas some 31,000 acres of foreshore.6.    Following local opposition to locating the research and development facilities at Tain, the Ministry of Defencecarried out a further exhaustive review of alternative sitesthroughout the United Kingdom, including Scotland andNorthern Ireland, but failed to identify any new area ofthe required size, which would meet the technical and safetycriteria, yet be environmentally and politically acceptable.7. - We have studied the reports of the 31 -possible sitesreviewed and considered both the environmental and technicalobjections to each one.   As a result, we concluded that, inScotland, there are only two possible sites for the P.&amp;E.E.facilities;   these are the existing R.A.F. air weapons rangesat Tain and West Freugh.  However, we noted that the futureuse of the West Freugh range for the testing and trials of aircraft would not be compatible with the proof and experimental work which we were seeking to relocate.   We also consideredthe range at Kirkcudbright, at present used by the MilitaryVehicles Experimental Establishment (M.V.E.E.1), but found thatit is topographically unsuitable for proof and experimental work;  P.&amp;E.E. facilities could not be resited there, even if additional land were to be acquired,8.    We also considered all possible sites in England, wales and Northern Ireland.   In Northern Ireland, MAGILLIGAN is theonly geographically feasible site, which does not conflict with air corridors;   this alone was sufficient to rule out all other possibilities.   At Magilligan, it would be necessary to acquire(confidential)
about 2,000 &amp;0rG3 O-i- S.(j.v1j. iilOxJo-j. jLoiiClJ    ScijQ. Ill aQQlOlon, W0found that there wore strong political and security objections.9. -   We established, that, in England and Wales, there were only three places to which the facilities could go:   Pombroy,CASTLEMRTIN or HJLWORTil.   To each there are strong objections.Pembrey could accommodate the facilities on the existing l,b00acres of Ministry of Defence land, with a land-take of 1,000acres, all of which is Forestry Commission land;   but, we considered that there would be strong political and environ-mental objections to reviving the proposal in an area wherea similar one has been turned down by a Public Inquiry.   Itwould also be necessary to move the R.A.F. range, at Peinbrey,to castle martin, and this would court strong local opposition.,because the only circuit pattern for aircraft using  the r^..^would overfly populated areas.   Royal Navy helicopter flying,at present at castle martin, would also have to move.10.  We also noted that castle martin could take the facilities,but only at the cost of displacing, on present dispositions,Royal! I Armoured Corps and Federal German Army training.   Theuse of castle martin by P.&amp;S. E. would also frustrate therelease of Lulworth, if our recommendations on this site were approved. ,,    , .11.  We have also considered the possibility of relocatingthe P.&amp;S.E. facilities at Lulworth, and have observed thatit is technically possible to do so.  However, this wouldalso frustrate our recommendation to release Lulworth.   Wenoted that this solution would also have the further objectionof significantly delaying the planned opening date of theThird London Airport.12,  We noted these difficulties and compared them with theproblems encountered at Taina Ross and Cromarty County Councilturned down the Ministry of Defence planning application onthe grounds of opposition from local residents.   All the localauthorities concerned alleged noise nuisance, particularly for the residents of Inver, possible adverse effects on thedevelopment of tourism, interference with fishing and sailing,and the possible restrictions on the development of Fearnairfield as a commercial enterprise.   The County Council alsotook the view that the Morrich More and associated beachesshould be made available for development of recreational facilities centred on Domoch Firth.   They were not soattracted by the prospect of some 400 additional jobs sincelocal unemployment is rapidly being absorbed by the expandingindustries in the Cromarty Firth area.   We established thatthe noise of guns would be offset to some extent by a reductionin the number of aircraft using the range, that there are no -major fishing or sailing activities in the area, and that therewB - 3.(confidential)
(confidential)is no possibility of the range being given up for recreationalpurposes, because it meets a long term operation requirement for the Royal Air Force.   Additionally, only an additional300 acres of grazing land would be needed at Tain and weunderstand the owners would be willing to sell.   Tain -isalso the only acceptable site which permits a constructionalprogramme in step with a withdrawal from Shoeburynessnecessary for the time-table for building of the Third london airport.   Lastly, we understand that the jobs offered bythe range would cover a.wide variety of-tasks which might be acceptable to the area, ranging from scientific, engineering and administrative, to industrial crafts, send-skilled workand general labouring.13.   Our review has shown that the relocation of the extensiverange facilities at Shoeburyness present formidable difficul-ties however it is done;   the technical requirements are soexacting that only very few sites in the United Kingdom canmeet them.  Each of these presents certain political and environmental objections.  Hov/ever, we have concluded thatTain,&apos;!with its existing R.A.F. range, offers the best solution,and we recommend accordingly.B - k(confidential)
(CONFIDENTIAL)ANNEX GThe provision of the proposed facilities at Tain wouldinvolve completing constructional work estimated to cost  k3.5 million in the next 5-6 years.    However, North Sea oil developments have imposed an extremely high demand for building and civil engineering work on Easter Ross.For the developments already taking place in this area, mostlyconnected with oil, about  h0 million will have to be invested in providing k,500 new houses (public and private) in the next 2^ years,and building will continue beyond 1975; in the next 5 years over 17 million will be spent on trunk roads and more than  5 million on schools and community facilities, together with a substantial amount on the utility services (water,  sewerage etc); and to thesecapital projects must be added both investment in the new factoriespnd workplaces themselves and the provision of accommodation for imported constructional labour.The severe pressure on this rural area, with its small existingpopulation, has already resulted in a dearth of building labour and very high tender prices.    Exceptional measures are being taken to try to keep pace with the demands,  since it is important, forbalance of payments and other national economic reasons, that theseoil-related developments should not be frustrated or delayed.    Ifthe proposed work at Tain is added to the already heavy overload,not only are these efforts likely to be defeated, but it seemsalmost inevitable that the present estimates of time and cost forthe Tain project will be exceeded.10 September 1975C - 1(confidential)
