1. The Ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the environment (RE) have been examining proposals for changes in theArmy junior training organisation.    The recent increase in the school leaving age has led to a very substantial decline in the number ofentrants - the entry in May of this year was only about 850 comparedwith 2, 900 the previous year - while the period of training has beenreduced on average from 2 years to one year.    There is therefore a greatly reduced need for junior training facilities.2. It is accordingly proposed to close the junior tradesmen&apos;sregiments at Rhyl (North Wales) and Troon (Ayrshire) and to carry outthe training elsewhere.    The Ministry of Defence see substantialbenefits in such an arrangement.    Not only will they be able to reduce their holdings of land and premises and to effect substantial netreductions in their military and civilian staff, with savings in running costs of well over  1 million a year;  they wiLL also be able to abandon the out-dated hutted accommodation at Rhyl and Troon and to concentratetraining facilities in modern purpose-built accommodation.    This is animportant benefit in view of the need to provide facilities which will encourage recruitment, which at present is seriously inadequate.3. RE have considered the implications of these proposals for regional policy.    191 civilian jobs wiLl be lost at Rhyl and 172 at Tronn.Both are areas where there is a high rate of unemployment - in february the figures for males were 11.7 per cent and 5. 8 per cent respectively.Both places are in assisted areas.    Moreover, the effect of abandoningthese establishments will be more serious than the mere figires of jobslost suggest because of the general increase in local economic activitybrought about by their presence.    The position at Rhyl is even moreworrying because the training centre is on the endge of the travel towork area of Shotton, where there are to be major steel closures.COPY NOiTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 8423 July 1973CABINETREORGANISATION OF THE TRAINING of junior SOLDIERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department
4. RE were originally asked to conisder whether the training of infantry junior leaders or tradesmen might be moved from Shorncliffeto keep either Rhyl or Troon open.    But they concluded that this wasnot acceptable since the accommodation at Shorncliffe has only rec-eiitlybeen  built for the purpose, at considerable cost..   They accepted alsothat there were compelling arguments for dicontinuing junior training at Rhyl and Troon.    Two matters however caused them concern.First, they were told that an early announcement was needed about thefuture of these two establishments, which were due to close for the summer vacation at the end of July and on present plans would not be receiving a new intake in the autumn.    The Secretary of State for Walesargued, however, that an announcement of the loss of even a comparatively small number of jobs at Rhyl would cause great public concern locallyand would be most inopportune until the task force which wasexamining the prospect of future employment in the Shotton area had submitted its report in the autumn.   Second, and more fundamentally, they considered that urgent and sympathetic consideration should be givento the continued use of Rhyl and Trcon, for other military purposes.They considered that there should be scope for this since they were informed that one-third of the army in the United Kingdom is stilloccupying hutted accommodation.    There is at present an excessiveconcentration of military installations in the south of England.    The aim,both in the interests of regional policy and on general planning and environmental grounds,   should be to secure a more even distribution;but although this is accepted in theory it usually proves impossible tosecure it in individual cases.   In the present instance the committee thought that the implications of the complete and permanent closure ofthe military installations at Rhyl and Troon would be so serious from thepoint of view of regional policy that the possibility of some alternative use by the army, even at some sacrifice, ought to be urgently considered.5. Thus the questions for consideration by my colleagues are first,whether a special effort should be made as a matter of urgency to findalternative defence uses for the facilities at Rhyl and Troon.    REappreciated that, as the Minister of State for Defence explained, therewould be genuine practical difficulties in doing this; but it seemed to themthatunless a real effort were made the Government could fairly be accused of failing to practise what it preached.    Second, there is thequestion of the timing of an announcement about the cessation of juniortraining at Rhyl and Troon.    An early announcement might perhaps betolerable if an indication could be given that both establishments were likely to continue to be used for military purposes, even if there were going to be some hiatus in the immediate future; but would an announce-ment be tolerable now - i. e. in advance of the submission of the reportof the Shotton   Task Force - if no such assurance could be included?R home Office23 July 1973 2
