THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOvTSRNMENICP (73) 85 COPY NO        6717 July 1973CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO 1977-78Memorandum by the Central Policy Review staff.     The 1973 Public Expenditure Survey is likely to raisemajor strategic issues for Ministers.        jj2o     The action taken in May has brought public expenditurein 1973-74- and 1974-75 broadly in line with what the economycan afford without risking a major reversal of the Governmenfstax objectives.,3.   But for the last 3 years of the present Survey, 1975-76to 1977-78, the problem is &quot;still unresolved,,   The first claim on resources over bhis period must be to re-establish asatisfactory balance of payments and to allow a sustainedincrease in private investment.   This will reduce the scope for increases in both private consumption and public expendi-ture.4-.   If public expenditure in the years 1975-76 is allowed toremain at the levels shown in the present Survey, the Govern-ment runs two serious risks:-a.   the tax burden will almost certainly have torise to finance these levels of public expenditure;the assessment of risks as between increasingtaxation and reducing the rate of increase in public expenditure involves a political judgment;bo   the resources left for private consumption will rise too slowly to satisfy public expectation forrising living standards; this will make counter-inflationary policy in the medium term verydifficult indeed.5.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer proposes (CP(73)81) tokeep the rate of growth of public expenditure at around3% per annum.   The effect of adopting these proposals wouldbe to re-establish an uncommitted Contingency Reserve in1977-78 of the order of  500 million.1SECRET
