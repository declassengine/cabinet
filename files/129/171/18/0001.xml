DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government &apos;;-,:&apos;V^;.:&apos;&apos;S&apos;?.-:K&apos;&apos;.V ii&apos;:k: v;.k^ &apos; &apos;CP(73) 98 COPY NO       g710 October 1973CABINETLATE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OCTOBER 1972RENT increases memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. On 19 July the Cabinet invited me to make a further report at theend of September on the problem caused by the failure of certain localauthorities to implement in time the rent increases due in October 1972under the Housing Finance Act0THE PROBLEM j;2, The extent of this problem can only be gauged approximately becausethe decision in each case rests primarily with the independent DistrictAuditor (DA) who will surcharge the councillors responsible for loss only where he is satisfied that the loss was due to their misconduct or negligence.The best present estimate is that there appears to be a strong case forsurcharge in the cases of the 13 English and 4 (Welsh) authorities listed inthe Annex.3.        It has been arranged that the audits of the first of these authorities,Camden and Merthyr Tydfil, should not be held until about November orDecember.    This would involve publishing in October the statutory noticeof audit.    It could well be March 1974 before the DAs were in a position toissue their decision.    The audits of the other authorities in the Annex arenot likely to follow until after Christmas.4.        Should no action be taken, it is possible that all councillors whovoted in favour of non-implementation, who abstained from votings or whowere absent without good reason from the meeting at which the decision wastaken, may be surcharged, jointly and severally, the sum of the net loss.If this sum is more than  500, which it is likely to be for each of the 13authorities, members surcharged are automatically disqualified from membership of any local authority (including the new authorities) for aperiod of five years.    The disqualification does not take effect until the periodallowed for making an appeal expires, or, if an appeal is made, until thedate on which the appeal is finally disposed of or dropped.    Over 200councillors might be so surcharged and disqualified.
AN AMNESTY WOULD REQUIRE legislation.        There is no existing power which would enable the High Court or theSecretary of State to relieve councillors of surcharge in this case.    Thepower to relieve is limited to cases where councillors have actedreasonably or in the belief that their actions were authorised by law.Nor can I use the powers used in the Merthyr Tydfil school milk case.The issue there was expenditure sanctioned by the Secretary of State,Now the issue is one of a loss or deficiency incurred by negligence ormisconduct.    I have no power to sanction that    The issue for decision is therefore whether to legislate to grant some or all of the councillorsinvolved a partial or total amnesty.THE CASE FOR AND AGAINST AN&apos; AMNESTY Jj6,        There are objections to an amnesty.    The councillors acted in full knowledge of the possible results.    An amnesty- would set a precedent for getting away with flouting the law and would encourage late implement a-tion of rent increases in the future.    Although the position this October hasnot fully crystallised, my present information is that there is only one large authority (the County Borough of Stockport) plus four small authorities who have refused to make the rent increases.    About 12 other authoritieshave been late and will thus lose income: these include Birmingham where,if surcharge for this year is eventually imposed, the sum per surchargedcouncillor could be large0    An amnesty would also be unfair to councillorswho are opposed to the Act but whose respect for the law led them to implement it on time and will seem misplaced to the ratepayers concerned.It might also be interpreted by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) as a sign of weakness in the context of the discussion about Stage 38 if the amnestywas announced in the near future.7,        But there are also strong arguments iu favour of an amnesty.Surcharge and disqualification on this scale is likely to increase oppositionto the Act, particularly since the size of the financial penalty is related tothe size of an authorityss housing stock, rather than to its lateness in implementing.    The decision to proceed with the October 1973 rent increases in spite of the opposition of the TUC might seem more offensive to the TUC if there appeared to be a vendetta over the October 1972 increases.A SUGGESTED COMPROMISE8.        These conflicting considerations appear to me to call for a compromise.    I therefore propose that1, The 5-year disqualification for surcharged councillorsshould stand.    Their deliberate flouting of the law has made themunfit to serve.
2. We should take power by amendment of Section 230 of theLocal Government Act 1933 to relieve those surcharged of personalliability in respect of the surcharge for 1972-73 only,    I would propose to use the power in England to relieve councillors except those in the three authorities which were the subject of defaultorders and did not comply within the period specified in the orderviz. Camden and the Urban Districts of Clay Cross and ConisbrougheWithin these three authorities one might consider a partialremission for the councillors of Camden and Ccnisbrough whoeventually resolved to implement of their own accord,,3a The decision should not be announced until it is clear thatthe announcement will not induce an authority to delay implementing the October 1973 rent increases.    Some authorities will be latemaking this increase and might be liable to surcharge when the accounts for this year are audited.    As a result, there will nodoubt be a demand for a second amnesty in a year&apos;s time,,    but these authorities will not be able to plead lack of time     To take power now to give them an amnesty would encourage them andothers to delay implementing rent increases from April 1974onwards,4.        Subject to the Lord Presidents views, the legislativevehicle might be a short Bill, rather than the Housing and planning bill already included in the 1973-74 Programme which is alreadydifficult to manage.SUBSIDY IMPLICATIONS9. The authorities who implemented late may, by forgoing income,have Increased their entitlement to housing subsidy.    This issue may betaken up by the Public Accounts Committee.    I therefore propose to takea power to withhold and recover subsidy of as. amount certified by theDistrict Auditor as Me best estimate of the loss Incurred.G r department of the Environment10 October 19733
