DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 9328 September 1973MORTGAGES AND MORTGAGE LENDINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. Last July the Cabinet authorised discussions with the building societies Association (BSA) on the establishment (without exchequer support) of voluntary schemes for stabilising the flow of mortgage funds and assisting first-time purchasers (CM(73) 31st Meeting, Minute 6).Since then there has been a sharp and unforeseen rise in interest rates,and the mortgage rate has increased to 11 per cent.    If these rates donot fall, I consider that, unless some action is taken, we face the seriousprospect of the continued pricing out of marginal first-time purchasers,coupled perhaps with mortgage rationing.    This could result in anaccelerating decline in the level of housebuilding - see Appendix A.IMMEDIA TE A C TIONStabilisation2.        Asa result of negotiations at official level the Council of the BSAwill consider on 4 October the acceptance of the attached Memorandum ofAgreement (Appendix B).    This provides for voluntary stabilisation ofthe flow of mortgage funds by a more controlled use of existing building society mechanisms with the investment rate being allowed to followmarket rates closely and quickly in order to produce an appropriate flow of mortgage funds.    The Agreement should prevent another house priceexplosion but it cannot shield mortgagors from rising interest rates.3. Once the Agreement is accepted by the Council and receives thenecessary support from the larger societies - which may take a fewweeks since their representatives may need to consult their Boards of directors - I recommend its immediate endorsement and implementation.But we should, also prepare on a contingency basis reserve powers tocontrol the investment or mortgage rate and the minimum liquidity ofany important society who might wreck the Agreement by not complying with BSA recommendations.copy NO67CABINET
Existing owner occupiers and first-time purchasers4. There is no case on housing grounds for shielding the generality of existing owner occupiers from present interest rates.    A number of suggestions for protecting existing owner occupiers are considered inAppendix C.    I believe that because of their implications for public sector finance any of these suggestions would be unacceptable.5. But there is a strong case on housing grounds for selectiveassistance to first-time purchasers, on the assumption that they are noteliminated from the market by sustained mortgage rationing.    The mainpossible options are discussed in Appendix C.    Most of them have beenconsidered and rejected earlier this year. I6. In an era of rising incomes the ability of a purchaser to repay hisdebt is better reflected in a mortgage under which repayments riserather than in a normal annuity mortgage.    Under pressure from officials the BSA representatives may advise the Council to recommend to membersa 3 year interest-only loan followed by a 35 year annuity as a means of reducing outgoings by glowing down the rate of capital repayment.    but such a recommendation may not be widely followed;  moreover at a mortgage rate of II per cent it would only reduce initial mortgage out-goings as compared with a 25 year annuity by 10.2 per cent net, whereasa reduction of 23 per cent net would be required to put potential first-time purchasers back where they were at the end of 1972 with a mortgage rateof 8. 5 per cent (see paragraph 6 of Appendix C).    I therefore recommenda scheme based on the deferment and capitalisation of interest of the kind which with Cabinet approval was put forward in discussions with the BSA,but with the addition of Government finance.    Such a scheme is illustrated in Appendix D.    The interest rate would be reduced to. 5 per cent in the first year - equivalent to a reduction of 17. 2 per centas compared with a 25 year annuity - for purchasers with incomes underand buying houses below, specified lower limits.    The assistance wouldbe phased out in equal steps over 5 years for each qualifying borrower.It would be tapered by giving half-rate assistance to purchasers fallingbetween upper and lower income/price limits.7. If Government support of the scheme took the form of a subsidythis would demonstrate very clearly our support for home ownership,would ensure a high level of take-up and would be simpler to administerthan if it took the form of an interest-bearing loan.    But a loan should,strictly speaking, suffice to meet the actual financial problems of first-time purchasers, and would be more consistent with our policies towardstenants.8. Assuming a mortgage rate of 11 per cent throughout, and startingat 1974 prices, a . subsidy would cost a maximum of  9 million in thefirst year, rising to about  66 million by the 6th year and levelling outthen except for any increase in house prices.    The cost of a loan would,at most, rise to  48 million in the 6th year and then fall away to2
 16 million in the 10th year as qualifiers sold their houses and repaidthe loan.    In practice a loan scheme would probably only cost about half this amount because there would be a much lower take-up if theassistance was in the form of a subsidy.9. Legislation would be necessary.    The scheme need notnecessarily be permanent because the relativities between house, prices,mortgage rates and incomes might change for the better.    I therefore propose that the legislation should enable the scheme to be terminated,and the interest rate floor and ceiling and house price and incomequalifying limits to be varied, by order.    I do not favour limiting thescheme to a short initial period subject to extension because this wouldnot make the right impression on purchasers and housebuilders.    Sincethe scheme can apply to most types of mortgage, we should also press the BSA to persuade members to adopt the three year interest only -35 year annuity scheme as their contribution to helping first-time purchasers.10.       The scheme could not be got off the ground before next year,because we could not avoid difficult negotiations with lenders whosevoluntary co-operation is essential to overcome totally new administra-tive problems.    This may necessitate modifications to the scheme.We may be pressed to give seme limited Exchequer guarantee againstthe extra risks of default by purchasers.    An early announcement couldencourage builders to improve starts.    Such an announcement is unlikely to cut the effective demand for completed houses until the scheme comes into force beyond the point to which it will probably be cut in any case bymortgage rationing.11.       I have considered the case for retrospective assistance to helpthose who have recently bought for the first time and who may now bein serious finarcial difficulties as a result of high mortgage rates.    Butquite apart from the administrative difficulties, I see no way of choosinga retrospective date which would not be felt to be intensely unfair by those who fall on the wrong side.12.       I must emphasise that the scheme could arrest the decline in private housebuilding only if there is no sustained, acute mortgagerationing.    I am confident that the scheme would not overheat thehousebuilding industry or significantly affect house prices.    Privatehousebuilding starts have been declining rapidly since the beginning of1973 and the scheme will not revive them to a level which is beyond theindustry1 s capacity.13.       Local authority lending is now restricted to priority categories ofborrowers and is thus directed mainly at first-time purchasers.Because of mortgage rationing by building societies, local authoritylending will probably have already reached about  280 million by mid-October as compared with the public expenditure provision of  218 million,and may reach about  350 million in 1973-74 unless we act to halt it atonce.    In the present climate it would be wholly unacceptable to increase
mortgage rationing by restricting this source of funds.    Local authoritylending will inevitably exceed present public expenditure provisions infuture years if building societies remain so short of funds.LONGER TERM14.       The scope for securing building society acceptance of government policies is limited by the fact that societies are so numerous,individualistic and independent.    The scope for Government control by direct legislative   action is limited, short of outright nationalisation,because we cannot risk involvement to the point of underwriting all their operations or hope to control by legislation their day to day borrowing andlending activities.    I am nevertheless concerned about the number ofsocieties, and the fact that they use short-term savings to finance long-term loans.    We may also be confronted with a new, fundamental problem.It may prove increasingly difficult to finance a high level of private house-building, in the context of volatile interest rates and growing sophisticationof investors, through the traditional means of small personal savings in building societies at low real rates of interest after discounting inflation.There is a case for securing the more rapid amalgamation of largersocieties and shifting a significant part of their savings from a short to along term base by, for example,  the creation of a secondary mortgagemarket eg through the Housing Corporation.    These propositions raise a wide range of difficult issues which could not be resolved quickly.    i recommend tnat the Chancellor and I should put in hand a -joint study atonce.CONCLUSION15.       I recommend -i.    Government endorsement of the Memorandum of agreement on Stabilisation subject to a satisfactory response from building societies and the preparation of reserve back up powers on a contingency basis (paragraph 3);ii.    immediate talks with the BSA with a view to early legislation for a Government supported interest-reducing grant or loanscheme (paragraph 6);iii. no further restriction in 1973-74 on local authority lending(paragraph 13);iv. a study of the longer-term problems of private sector housing finance (paragraph 14).GRDepartment of the Environment28 September 1973\

The level of private sector housebuilding is falling.    In19?&quot;2 196,000 houses were completed and 227,000 were started.   Inthe first four months of. 197.3 houses were completed and started at an   annual rate of 207,000 and 2^0,000 respectively (seasonallyadjusted) ; in the peri A May     --August 1973 tho annual rates were about18 5,000 and 210,000 respectively,   There is anecdotal evidencethat the rate ox starts has fallen even further more recently.FIRST TIME PURCHASES3*-        The percentage of building society mortgages granted tofirst time purchasers has fallen,    This is illustrated by thefollowing figures   -which refer to mortgage completions and there-fore refer to market conditions some three months earlier inrespect of each quarter shown - from the p?&apos;1 sample of building society mortgages&apos;.--

In fact only 8,000 out of tho actual number of 61;,000first-time purchasers in the second quarter 1973 had incomes under 2,000.    So it- can be said that 8,000 ;out of the 12,000 fewerfirst-time purchasers in the second quarter of 1973 were people with lower incomes who had been squeezed out.    The indications are that the third and fourth quarters will show a continued decline,The Department consider that the worsening position of thefirst time purchaser is due to a combination of rising mortgagerates and high house prices.    It is argxiable that high mortgagerates -would be wholly offset by a proportionate reduction in houseprices.    This seems unlikely.    For example to offset an increasein the mortgage .rato from 9.5$ to 11 $ house prices would havo tof.0Al by about 11 ;&apos;o.    Even if this were to happen, it would takekitao for the market to re-establish itself at a lower price level,uuring this period man;/ potential buyers would bo squeezed out ofIfoc market and builders&apos;&apos; might cut back on starts so hard that itwould take several years to reverse the trend.confidential

It; is not possible to say what effect the recent measures tocurb bank competition for small savings will have on building societies.

The estimate    of starts in 1973 and 197U is morespeculative because it is necessarily based on a judgement abouthow builders would react in cutting back their programmes- in the face of high mortgage rates and mortgage rationing.8.   A scheme of assistance designed to bring back into the marketa substantial range of potential first-time purchasers who havebeen squeezed out might induce builders locking ahead to 197h and1975 to raise starts and completions in 197h above these forecasts,but not to the level of 1972. But the effectiveness of the scheme would mainly depend on how far- building societies could be persuaded to meet the resultant additional demand from first-tine purchasersby restricting to an even greater extent their lending to thosesecond-time purchasers who are not selling to first-time purchasersor buying new houses.    This would in turn depend.to a large extent on how long market interest rates remained at their present level.

DRAFT MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT

BUILDING SOCIETY MORTGAGE FRANCE

General Objectives

1. The Government and the Council of the Building Societies Association agree that, subject to such overriding considerations as may be imposed by the Government&apos;s overall economic and social policies, their common objectives are:-

i. to support the growth of owner-occupation;

ii. to produce and maintain conditions in which the housebuilding industry can plan for a high and stable level of housebuilding for sale;

iii. to ensure that house prices do not increase at an unreasonable rate, and

iv. to maintain an orderly housing market in which, subject to iii above, sufficient mortgage funds are available to enable those wishing to do so to exercise a reasonable choice of owning the sort of house they want.

The Government and the Council of the Building Societies Association agree that building societies will continue to be the chief source of mortgage funds for house purchase and they further agree that, if the above-mentioned objectives are to be successfully realised, building societies will need to pursue borrowing, lending, and interest rate policies which should result in a stable supply of mortgage funds appropriate both in relation to the


level of effective demand and the supply of new and existing dwellings .for sale.Borrowing and,,Lending polioios2.   The Government and the Council of tho   Building Societies Associationconsider that the objectives in paragraph 1 are likely to be most readilyachieved by a system based on a more flexible approach to changes in therate paid to investors but, as far as possible, with less frequentconsequential adjustments to the mortgage rate.   This could involve awidening and a narrowing of the margin between the investment and the mortgage rates from time to time.   They also agree that the achievement of the overall objectives would also be assisted by a more flexible useof liquidity within the limits of prudent management, over short-termperiods between necessary changes in the investment rate, and by appropriate selective lending policies.   The Council therefore agree tobe ready:i, to recommend an increase or reduction in the investment rate as frequently (within the limits of practicability) as appearsnecessary to provide a flow of mortgage funds at the level requiredto achieve the objectives in paragraph 1 jii, to advise member societies to conduct their lending policieswith restraint, especially as regards second-time purchasers-&quot;-, ifit appears at any time that excessive mortgage funds might otherwisebo released in relation to the number of purchasers and the supply -of dwellings with a consequent undesirable rate of increase in house prices; .-::-bGTE: In the Memorandum a &apos;second-tine purchaser&apos; includes any purchasernot purchasing for the first time.
(confidential)iii.   to give general advice to in.or.iber societies as to whetherliquidity should be reduced or increased, depending on whether, there appears to be a temporary shortfall of funds or conversely a temporaryexcess which might lead to avoidable inflation in house prices, it being appreciated that the extent to which an individual society canfollow such advice (particularly with regard to a reduction of its &apos;-    ,       . . . &apos;           :f J   l /liquidity) must be governed by its financial position;iv.   to encourage member societies, especially if there is a temporaryshortfall in the inflow of funds, to lend to creditworthy borrowerson suitable properties in the following order of priority:a.   members of societies, who are -1t   first-time rmrchasers:2.   purchasers of new dwellings;3.   second-time purchasers if they are obliged to move urgently;.

(confidential)APPENDIX Gassistance to&apos;owner occupiersbuilding society finance1,     There are about Utj- - Ipg- million building society mortgagors(at mid 1973)* and probably about 1 million other mortgagors.Total mortgage debt owed to building societies at mid 1973 wasabout  13,700 million.    The number of new building-societymortgages taken out in a year in which there was no serious mortgagerationing would be in the region of 600,000 - 650,000,; of which50/&amp; - 55$ would be first-time purchasers.    New mortgages taken out would be, slightly over  li,000 million (at 1973 house prices), ofwhich about  2,000 million would consist of advances to first-time purchasers.2.     Looking to the future ,    it may prove increasingly difficultto finance a high level of private housebuilding, in the context ofvolatile interest rates and with more sophisticated investors,through the traditional means of small personal savings in building societies at low rates of interest after discounting inflation.If this turns out to be the case difficulties may arise becausesavings in building societies can virtually be withdrawn on demandalthough they are used to finance long-term housing loansaPresent position op owner occupiers3.     All existing and potential mortgagors benefit from tax relief on mortgage interest or the option mortgage subsidy.    Tax: relief atthe basic rate reduces a gross mortgage interest of 11% to 707%.
Tax relief on mortgage, interest    cost  39.0m in 1972/73and the&apos;option mortgage subsidy is estimated to cost  50ia in 1973/74,h.   Increases in mortgage rates put up the outgoings of allmortgagors who cannot extend their terms, and so put pressure ontheir budgets, in some instances to a degree of hardship..   for first-time purchasers, higher interest rates mean heavy, and incertain instances unsustainable burdens in the early years, eventhough the rising money incomes that tend to go with higherinterest rates reduce the burden in later years in a v/ay whichbalances over the lifetime of the mortgage.   For first-timepur-chasers the fundamental problem is to so schedule outgoings asto match ability to pay; the standard annuity mortgage does thisonly when, incomes rise slowly..5.   Tlie Department estimate that, when the mortgage rate goes up   j-to 11$, up to about half of fch.e-.lu5 million building-societymortgagors may not be able to avoid increased repayments by the traditional-method of extending their mortgage periods becausechoir previous level of repayment would not cover the interest due on their outstanding capital debt.   The increase in the mortgagerate from 9*5$ to 11$ would be about 12$ gross for mortgagors intheir first year - see Annex.6,  As for potential first-time purchaseres, if they were to be putback in the position they were in at the end of 1972 when the mortgage rate was 8.5$ it would be necessary to reduce the inert-Gage outgoings in the;first year by 25$ gross (23$net).   This is illustrated by the following table:(confidential)

Average building societyreserves currently total about 3*5% ( 5k-0m),   Consequently societiescould on average run at a loss on current account at the expenseof a reduction in reserves for a considerable period withoutfalling below the trustee reserve ratio eg a loss-making ratestructure of 7-5% / 10$ instead of 7*5?* / 11$ for one year wouldresult in a reduction in average reserves from 3*5$ to about 2o$4There would, however, bo considerable objections in requiring the;\ ..    , &apos;  III;&quot; &apos; 0. &apos;.......       -building societies to run at a loss for as long as a yenr-rincidence in the societies could bo affected and if reserveratios were reduced;below devels&apos;-thought&apos; commercially prudent, an(c)  Il^^y^njjv^^

In addition,  societies would be unwilling bo reduce liquidity to 10$ without the safeguard of an exchequer guarantee of their depositors&apos; funds.

But the higher the interest rate.;, the less cansuch schemes reduce imtitial mortgage outgoings because these cannotbe got down below the level of the interest due on the total debteg at 11   the maximum reduction that can be achieved in the first year of a mortgage in comparison with an orthodox       year annuity mortp-a^eis 7.h.f0 gross &quot;(10.2^ net).    These types of scheme are unpopular- withsocieties because they are more difficult to administer:    and. theyreduce cash flow by slowing down the rate of capital repayment.Interest-reducing Schemes20-.   A greater impact can be made on the reduction of initial mortgageoutgoings by the deferment and capitalisation of part of the initialinterest duo ie a part of the interest due in the initial years of a mortgage is deferred and repaid by instalments on a compounded basisat a later stage in the mortgage or from the procoeds of sale.    the alliance Building Society operate a simple and limited version- of theformer;    the Department have put forward the latter for considerationiii discussion with the BSA.    Again building societies dislike such schemes for the reasons advanced against lew-start mortgages.c i .   The advantage of such schemes over those based on re-schoduling&quot;the rate of capital repayment only is that the initial mortgageoutgoings can be reduced to virtually any desired level by choosingau appropriately lower initial level of repayment..

The Department1s illustrative scheme, if financed bya    Government subsidy, end applied on the selective&apos; basisproposed at &quot;197^ prices, and allowing for an increase in house prices of 7^ p^a would cost a maximum of  9 million in the first year, rising to about  66 million in the sixthyear, and then levelling out except for any increase due to increasing house prices.    If the scheme wore based on loansrather than grants the cost would tccal  !j8 million in the sixth year and then fail to  i 6m In the tenth year asqualifiers sold their houses and repaid their loans.    Bothcalculations assume that all eligible first-time purchasersv/ould use the scheme, but many are unlikely &quot;to use it,particularly if it takes the form of loans.This scheme is analogous to the U.S &quot;Section 235&quot; scheme,v.:hich is now in abeyance for reasons of economy.    Underthis scheme a subsidy was available to purchasers of new and improved houses;    the amount of assistance was designedt0 keep mortgage outgoings down to 20fo of income.    It would be inappropriate to limit the interest-reducing scheme to new houses!lu this country because most first-time; purchasers buy cheaperexisting houses.    The direct relationshio between the amount of w B-MI fc l*f L. V\ g I FX I
subsidy and tho level of income is also mere complicated than under the Department&apos;s scheme, which relates assistance to the mortgage rate, because it involves periodicre-assessmont of income,23,     Another way of reducing the level of interest payable, on a mortgage would be to increase the rate of option mortgage subsidy,although this would need amending legislation.    Under the optionmortgage subsidy scheme, any house purchaser can choose the subsidy in lieu of tax relief on mortgage interest.    The subsidy broadlyreduces the amount of not interest payable by about the same amount 1as tax relief (30/ ).    The primary purpose of the scheme is to givethe house purchaser whose income is so low that he is liable forlittle or no tax about the same amount of help as the better offhouse purchaser with a higher income who could therefore get fulltax relief on mortgage interest,    But to increase the rate of optionmortgage subsidy - to say the equivalent of a IlSS reduction ininterest - would be an indiscriminate and expensive way of dealingwith the problem of high interest rates, because the option mortgagesubsidy is available at a flat rate to a3.1 existing optionmortgagers and also to any house purchaser irrespective of income orhouse price.    It would also be more costly in public expenditure termThis, is because if the only access to the higher subsidy was throughthe option mortgage scheme, an increasing number of basic rate taxpayers would, choose the option mortgage in lieu of tax relief on mortgage interest.    Consequently public expenditure would increasenot only be the amount of the increase in the rate of the option mortgage subsidy, but also by the amount of the basic option.,mortgage subsidy equivalent to tax relief on mortgage interest forger.by house purchasers who would otherwise have chosen tax relief.[ COi^nUiCl&apos;M I SAL

If the assistance took the form of a loan repayable on resale the public expenditure costs would remain high initially until the loans began to be repaid on sales.

Capitalised Family Allowances

27. It is understood that New Zealand operate a system whereby family allowances can be commuted to provide the initial deposit on a house for younger first-time purchasers.

28. Such a scheme could only apply to a minority of first-time purchasers. Most first-time purchasers have no children or only-one child and a capitalised family allowance could only apply to first-time purchasers with two or more children. Consequently not more than at most one-third of the first-time purchasers that might be covered by a scheme limited by reference to income and house price limits would benefit. But even such a limited scheme, apart from the difficulty mentioned in paragraph 25 above, has the drawback that, whereas a capital contribution large enough to keep initial mortgage outgoings at the same level as they would be with a 25 year 81/2% annuity would need to amount to £885 for a typical £5,000 loan, a capitalised family allowances for a two child family would not exceed £350 at most - assuming that the qualifying child had just been born, and 90p a week capitalised over 16 years at 11%. Moreover the capitalised allowance would make a family worse off week by week as the consequential reduction in gross outgoings would normally be a little less than the reduction in income on account of cessation of allowances, because the family allowance is payable for not more than 16 years whereas the usual first-time purchase as mortgage runs for 25 years.

29. Because a capitalised family allowance would be limited in size and application it would not involve initial costs in excess of about £10m a year.

Differential Interest Rates

30. First-time purchasers might be charged lower interest rates by building societies and existing mortgagors might be charged proportionately higher rates. If, for example, first-time purchasers were charged lower rates on model of the proposed interest-reducing grant or loan scheme (see Appendix D), the building societies could cover this lost revenue by charging existing mortgagers 11.4% instead of 11% by the time the scheme was at the peak of its expenditure after 5 years, and assuming an 11% mortgage rate throughout. It would however be difficult to launch such a scheme at the expense of existing mortgagers when the mortgage rate has reached such an unprecedented level. It might be more acceptable simply to charge higher interest rates for higher income mortgagers. But there are too few for this to enable interest rates to be substantially reduced for first-time purchasers even on a selective basis. For example if all building society mortgagers with debts in excess of £10,000 were charged 12% when the "normal" mortgage rate was 11%, this would only enable first-time purchasers on the selective basis proposed to be charged 10%. Furthermore penal interest rates for better off Building Society mortgagers could drive them away to other financial institutions.

EQUITY OR INDEX LINKED MORTGAGES

31. Which publicity has been given to the possibility of equity or index linked mortgages as methods of reducing mortgage out-goings. Very generalised proposals for the latter have been put forward by Mr Cox of the Alliance Building Society and Mr Hirsch of Nuffield College, such propositions would need enabling legislation.


(confidential)52-.   With tho equity mortgage, the mortgagor pays a fixed (and low)rate of interest on his mortgage, but when ho sells his house lie pays an agreed proportion of -the capital appreciationto the mortgagee.53.   An index linked mortgage might work as follows.   The mortgagorwould start with, say, a 6/i annuity mortgage and the, phasing&apos; ofannuity repayments would be calculated in the normal way, - &apos; -But at the end of each year the outstanding capitalj debt wouldbe scaled up in accordance with an agreed index.   This would have2 results.   First at the end. of each year the principal and interestpayable would bo scaled up,   Second,;if the mortgagor sold his house bpfore expiry of the full term of tho mortgage, he wouldrepay the scaled up outstanding : amount.   For example, with a 3,000 mortgage for 23 years at 6% the outgoings in the first year would be  391 gross.   I If the index rose by % a year, theoutgoings in the sixth year would have risen to  4-99 *   If themortgagor redeemed his mortgage in the eighth year he would haveto repay  6,057 as&apos;, compared with  4,098 raider a normal annuity -the difference is attributable to compound interest at 5$ p.a,on the principal outstanding,   If he kept the mortgage runningfor 25 years, his last annual instalment would have risen to 13.2A but there would be no outstanding capital to repay,2&apos;!-,   Tho Kiksch version of the index:--!inked mortgage is .associated with a &quot;kortgage Refinance Agency&quot;, established bytho Government,   &apos;Ihe purpose of the Agency is to make it possible for now mortgagors to base their outgoings on an agreed index so that they pay interest at less than the normalmortgage rate in the initial yoors arid at a higher rate inthe later years.   &apos;i&apos;ho building society provide   the original(confidential)
(confidential)&apos;.&apos;mortgage and then transfer       it to tho Agency.   The Agencyreceives the. inde^-linhod payments from -the mortgagor andpays to the society what the society would have received fromthe mortgagor on a normal annuity,   1&apos;hc Agency&apos;s deficiency in the early years of the mortgage has to &quot;be financed by theGovernment,yy,   The equity mortgage could pose serious difficulties forthe owner-occupier whose income rose mere slowly than the valueof his house, especially if the mortgagee1s share of the equitywas substantial,   la order to pay the mortgagee the amount due,he would either have to /move to a worse house, or increase theproportion of income spent on mortgage repayments.   This problem could be avoided only by equity mortgages on indefinite term :or by a succession of equity mortgages with tire mortgagee (orlast mortgagee) faking his capital share from the estate of the deceased mortgagor.   Keny householders - and lenders would findsuch an arrangement,unattractive,JG,   from the mortgagor:s standpoint the index-linked mortgageis much less risky than the equity mortgage, unless his incomerises more slowly than the index.   But there are manor difficultiesin determining what combination of basic interest rate andindex increase give the same return to tire 3.ender asdoes an ordinary annuity mortgage at.the going interest ratee37. Both equity mortgages and index--linked mortgages producereturns to the mortgagee that are uncertain in amount and, withthe equity mortgage, also in timing (because- he does not knowwhen tho mortgagor will sell).    Building societies clearly wouldnot use short-term savings carrying a market rate of interestto finance long term mortgages with an uncertain return.    Even
(confidential)if they were to take such a risk, there would be initial deficits&apos; to the extent that the interest rate paid by mortgagors waslower than the corresponding investment rate paid by societiesfor their savings.Such deficits could in practice only be covered by a reduction in building society reserves -which theywould certainly object toor by Government subventions until such time as the returns from equity or index linked mortgagesmounted.    Similarlyy ttthe Hirsch &quot;MRA&quot; would need government support to get it off the ground.38.     Accordingly, if building societies were to grant equity or index-linked mortgages,  they would probably need to obtain the necessary fundsthrough the sale of a novel type of security bond   where the interest is   ;index-linked, or bonds which mature on a fixed date and are then redeemedfor an amount which depends on the rise in house prices since the dateof issue.   How large the market for such bonds would be is a matter forconjecture; but if index-linked bonds- proved popular, other financial institutions could issue them as well and or equal terms with building societies.    This would not be a market in which the building societiescould offer a unique combination of interest, liquidity and security.39-     In any case It would be dangerous for the Government toencourage on a national basis schemes for mortgage finance which pre-suppose perpetual inflation for their success.    It is of some relevancethat index linked mortgages are used in Brazil, which has suffered froman abnormal and persistent rate of inflation.    Building societies inBrazil pay 6 per cent interest on savings, but a &quot;monetary correction&quot; of16 per cent a year is made both to the capital sum saved and the mortgagedebt.    If particular building societies wished to experiment with equityor index-linked mortgages to meet special local situations,  this mightbe less objectionable, but such experiments would have no significant effort in this shorter-term.

The assistance would take the form of periodic payments from the Exchequer sufficient to reduce the monthly Interestelement in a mortgage repayment to qualifying lenders by a specified amount in the first 5 years for first tine purchaserson a selective basis.    It is proposed that the assistance should reduce the interest element in a mortgage repayment to 8.5/j inthe first year for first time purchasers who fall below specifiedlower income and house /price limits and should be phased out inequal steps over 5 years eg.Year^1   Year 2   Year 5   Year 4   Year 5,   Year 6Examole a mortgage rate	iip;	11%	11&amp;	11%	US:	lip-Loon	2,5x		1.5^	1%	0.5%	-Reduced Rate payable	5.5;-	9.op	9.5^	10$	p. ,&apos;,(V 10.5P	lipExample B						Mortgage rate	l!;::	.10P	11%		S.5P	Loan	2.%.	.  l.?l.i	1.5P	O.SP. lj:		XPReduced Rate payable	a   c r.	8.8P,	9-5P	C\   /If&quot;&apos;	3.5P	o:
CONFIDEfMTIA3.     Half of the full assistance would be available to first-time purchasers who fall between specified upper and lower income and house price limits eg the half-rate loans under Example a would be equivalent to a reduction of interest of 1.25$ in year 1,1$ in year two and so on.4.     Ho assistance would be payable for any part of the fiveyear period during which the amount due was less than the equivalent of a reduction of 0.1$ interest or if the mortgageinterest rate fell to 8.6$ or less.CRE.DITWORTHINESS5&quot;.      It. would be for the lender to decide in the normal way upon the credit-worthiness of a first-time purchaser when considering anapplication for a mortgage advance.    But it is essential for thesuccess of the scheme that lenders should take a favourable view ofthe purchaser&apos;s capacity to meet the mortgage outgoings and should pay full regard to the effect on mortgage outgoings of the reductionof interest to 8.5$ in the first year and to expected increases in incomes generally when assessing the maximum mortgage advance whichmight.be made in individual cases.gSTHOf OP CALCULATING .AGSI3TAE10E6.     Assuming an 11$ mortgage rate throughout, for illustrativepurposes, the Government assistance would in principle be thedifference between two annuities at 8.5$ gross and 11$ gross inthe first year, 9$ gross and 11$ gross in the second year andso on.   The mortgagor&apos;s account would be credited with capitalrepayments appropriate to an annuity mortgage at 11$.    It isunderstood however that lenders normally recalculate outstandingmortgage debt only on the first day of their financial year.
(confidential^Consequently, to avoid recalculation of debt during a financial jyear, the Government assistance in the second year would be calculated by reference to the difference between an annuity at115;. and a first year annuity at 9?- on the whole of the originalmortgage -advance for the full mortgage period, and similarlyin subsequent years.   when a mortgage involves interest-onlypayments(eg endowment mortgages,) the Government assistance&apos;would simply be the difference between the two interest ratelevels on the total capital debt.7.     A similar approach would be used for option mortgages.TIES LOAH ;^0?5RHAG?rV58.     If the assistance took the form of a loan, it is forconsideration whether it should be treated as a loan to the lender or to the mortgagor; and whether the interest payable on the loan should be calculated at the relevant normal mortgagerate from time to time or at the appropriate rate of interest for exchequer loans.9.    The Government loan with interest would be.repaid from the proceeds on the sale of the house.    If the house had not been sold after ten years the loan would be added to the outstandingmortgage debt and repaid by instalments over the residual life of the mortgage.    The mortgagor would be free however to repay the Government loan by instalments before the expiry of a periodof ten years from the purchase if he wished to do so.IkTOOkEAin) HCU35 111 ICE LIklTS10.
