&quot;0PUBLIC EXPENDITURE-GENERAL REVIEWI. INTRODUCTIONMinisters have recently decided the public expenditure programmes for 1973-74 and 1974-75,modifying priorities within them in so doing. Thisreport provides the information required for deciding the programmes also for 1975-76 to1977-78. The programmes for the complete fiveyears will be published in the next annual public expenditure White Paper which is due in the lateautumn.2. Ministers will wish to consider the programmes for 1975-76 to 1977-78 against the background bothof those which they published in the latest annualWhite Paper, Cmnd. 5178 of last December, andof the demands of private investment, the balanceof payments, and personal consumption. The rateof growth of personal consumption has to beconsidered in relation to counter-inflation policy;and there would be dangers in failure to keep therate reasonably in line, over a period, with the expectations of people generally.II. COMPARISON WITH CMND. 51783. Cmnd. 5178 presented programmes amountingto  30,217 million for 1972-730) and rising to 33,528 million by 1976-77 by the followingannual percentage increases1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-775-3	1-7	1-8	1-4The average annual increase for 1972-73 to 1976-77was 2 - 6 per cent.4. But, as the Cabinet recognised when they approved these programmes for publication, the contingency Reserves, which were shown as rising from  350 millionf) for 1973-74 to  700 million(a)for 1976-77, were already virtually fully committedfor unspecified but foreseeable expenditures.5. This is borne out by the costings in this report,which show, for example, that the total of the programmes for 1976-77 exceeds that of Cmnd.5178 by  646 million net at 1973 Survey prices. Ofthis,  121 million is due to changes in the estimatedcost of Cmnd. 5178 policies and  334 million to policy decisions taken since Cmnd. 5178; and theremaining  191 million represents the best availableestimates of net expenditure which are foreseeablebut on which policy has yet to be determined.(3)Details for each year are given in Annex A.6. While the changes raise the total for 1976-77from the Cmnd. 5178 level of  33,528 million to 34,210 million^1) those for 1972-73 reduce theCmnd. 5178 level from  30,217 million to  29,681million.(4)	The	annual	percentage	increasesbecome:				1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-786-5	2-1	3-4	2-4	3-3Comparison with the figures in paragraph 3 showsthat the annual increases are steeper than theywere in Cmnd. 5178 for every year especially for1975-76, which, however, reflects the fact that ministers have reduced the programmes for thepreceding two years and have yet to consider theperiod from 1975-76 onwards.(&apos;) The figures in this paragraph are in cost terms (t.e. including the relative price effect) adjusted to 1973-74 estimated outturn prices,excluding investment grants.(2) Including provision for upratings of social security benefits.(3) The  191 million net referred to in this paragraph is  491 million gross, less  300 million by reduction in the Contingency reserve for 1976-77. The inclusion of this provision in the programme totals is in part a departure from the concept of including only agreedcostings of existing policies. It includes two items subsidies to British Railways ( 140 million) and subsidies to the National coal board ( 70 million) on which it is necessary to put a figure in order that the overall total should not appear misleadingly low. it also includes  242 million for social security benefits, because a former convention, whereby benefits were assumed to rise in line with earnings, has been resumed for long-term benefits. The inclusion of these three items does not imply prior agreement either to future policy proposals in these areas or to these figures as costings of what would be involved in such agreement, which could be either lower or in some cases higher. This course has been preferred to the alternative of providing for these foreseeable proposals in a very large contingency reserve.On the other hand we continue to treat as a potential claim on the contingency reserve certain other items which are foreseeable inprinciple though not in detail (including new proposals for selective assistance under Section 8 of the Industry Act) but which arenot by themselves large enough to alter the broad order of magnitude of the programme total. Finally, the Defence Budget is afurther case where the figures are not an agreed costing of policy; in this instance the items of expenditure which are contingent oron which agreement has still to be reached are presented as an &quot; additional bid &quot;, but are not included in the programme total. Theprogramme total does however include  39 million arising from the accounting changes consequent on the abolition of the Purchasing(Repayment) Services Votes.(*) Mainly because of the effects of high prices for food, which reduced agricultural support payments, and for land, which retardedlocal authorities&apos; purchases for roads, etc.; the effects of the 2-month building strike; and shortfall in nationalised industries&apos; capitalexpenditure.
m.  DEMAND ON RESOURCES9. The increase in public expenditure, 1973-74 to1977-78, is given in paragraph 7 above as anaverage annual rate of 2-8 per cent. This impliesan increase in demand on real resources at anannual rate of 3-1 per cent. This becomes ;3-5 percent for the period 1972 to 1978,(s) during,whichperiod the gross domestic product may beexpected to increase at an average annual rate of3-9 per cent a year.(-) The medium-term economic assessment is prepared in termsof calendar years, and is based on 1972.TABLE public expenditure by programme  million1973-74estimate1977-78estimateAverageannualpercentageincrease1973-74 to1977-78At 1973-74 outturn prices(including relative price effect^Defence Budget........	...                  3,558	3,785	1-6	. &apos;                      /   94	141	10-7	279	375	7-7EEC and other overseas services......	307	457	10-5	542	396	-7-5	147	156	1-5Trade, industry and employment			Investment grants       .      ...	199	11		1,630	1,003	-11-4	&apos;.&apos;                        2,006	2,383	4-4	1,201	1,510	5-9	.      .              372	439	4-2	1,664	1,522	-2-2	1,524	1,748	3-5	...             980	1,258	6-4	&apos;    64	68	1-5	4,145	5,094	5-3	3,390	4,093	4-8	5,484	6,123	2-8	.      .      .             346	363	1-2	.      .      .             331	453	8-2	.            .              128	135	1-3	.      .             782	833	1-6	2,700	2,700	Shortfall......      .      .      .      .      .      .	-200	-200		...              150	500	Total expenditure   .      .	.      .       &apos;   31,624*	35,335*	2-8*\ Total demand on output .      .      .      .	...      .  &apos;       26,919*	30,413*	3-1** Excluding investment grants.SECRET$-7. The average annual increase from 1972-73 to1976-77 is 3-7 per cent compared with 2-6 percent in Cmnd. 5178. If, however, the increase ismeasured from 1973-74 to 1977-78- rollingforward from last year&apos;s White Paper, as is thenormal practice-the programmes in this reportimply an average annual rate of increase fallingbetween these two rates, at 2-8 per cent.8. Figures for the individual programmes are sum-marised in Table 1. The graph compares levels ofthe total programmes as now costed with those ofthe successive programmes published since theGovernment took office.

But from this rising total of resources, asubstantial proportion, is expected to be requiredfor the large increase in private investment, whichis itself required in order to achieve and sustain the increase in GDP, and for bringing the externalbalance back to a position of adequate surplus.When these prior claims have been allowed for,the growth in resources available for public expenditure and privately financed consumption is  per cent a year. If public expenditure rose by asmuch as 3-5 per cent a year in demand terms,privately financed consumption would have roomto rise by only just over 2\ per cent a year.
11. So low a rate of increase in privately financedconsumption could well be insufficient to matchgeneral expectations. It is markedly less than themost pessimistic prospect 3-3 per cent outlined in last year&apos;s public expenditure White Paper asimplied by the programmes set out there.12. Such an outcome would imply that there wouldbe virtually no scope for reducing the nominal ratesof taxation or for increasing allowances; in other words that the real burden of taxation would berising. Moreover, the tax credit scheme also bearson this point. The details of the scheme, andtherefore its cost, have yet to be settled; but if thenet cost were to be met by taxation (as opposedto reductions in public expenditure), it would bevery difficult to design tax measures which wouldnot leave a substantial number of taxpayers tocarry an even greater tax burden.13. To raise the average rate of growth ofprivately financed consumption to 3 per cent a year from 1972 to 1978 would entail reducing the levelof public expenditure in 1977-78 by some 800 million; and this would reduce the rate of growth of public expenditure from 1972 to 1978 tothe same rate 3 per cent a year in demand terms.This would also have the effect of leaving roomwithin the total for a substantial contingency reserve free of commitment subject to the points in the next following section.IV. ADDITIONAL BIDS14. The problem is made more acute by proposalsfor additional expenditure. These amount for1977-78 to  402 million. Details are given in annex B.15. Moreover, the costings in this report assume that nationalised industries will take full advantageof latitude under the price code to increase their prices to cover allowable cost increases as agreed by the Price Commission. To the extent thatsubsidy on current account may be needed in spiteof this, it would represent a further addition to public expenditure.V. MODIFICATIONS OF POLICY16. When the Cabinet commissioned this report,however, they foresaw the need to consider inter-preting existing policies more restrictively ormodifying policies in order to reconstitute the Con-contingency Reserve. The report therefore includes, inaddition to the costing of the programmes on theusual basis of existing policies,(6) alternativevariants costing less. All the summary tables and individual programme tables in this report embody(6) Following the accepted convention, where the Treasury andthe spending Department have been unable to agree on thecost of existing policies, the Treasury&apos;s figure has, withoutprejudice, been incorporated in the Part 1 tables: Details ofthe Departmental positions are given in Annex B to Part 1and in Part 2.the former; the variants are summarised in annex C, with more detail in the commentaries inPart 2 of this report on the individual programmes.17. Since commissioning this report Ministers havetaken policy decisions reducing the programmes for 1973-74 and 1974-75. These, which were announced by the Chancellor on 21st May, reducedexpenditure by  500 million (at 1972 Survey prices)for 1974-75 and approaching  100 million for1973-74; and these reductions are reflected (at 1973Survey prices) in the costings for the respectiveyears in this report.18. These decisions, while they do not prejudge the levels of any of the programmes for subsequent years, create some problems for the expression of&quot; existing policies &quot; as the starting point for con-sideration. The way in which these have been dealtwith in this report is set out in Annex D. Pointscalling for decisions arise in two areas localauthorities&apos; current expenditure, and expenditure on civil service manpower. In each case the 1974-75level is affected by the reductions announced on21st May 1973, and the question arises of theextent to which that reduction should affect expendi-ture in subsequent years up to 1977-78.19. While decisions on these two points mightcontribute to the reductions to be considered for theyears 1975-76 to 1977-78, Ministers will wish toexamine also other possibilities with that purpose in view. The variants, which have been includedin this report on the Cabinet&apos;s instructions, providematerial accordingly.20. Although the variants have been the subjectof discussion between the Treasury and the spendingDepartments, and although the facts as set downrepresent interdepartmental agreement (unless otherwise indicated) in the sense that a statedchange in a policy or its interpretation would, it isbelieved, lead to the expenditure saving noted, theyare not recommendations. Some of them would be strongly opposed by Departments. Some couldinvolve severe embarrassment, given past public statements. No Ministerial approval is implied bythe inclusion of a costed variant in the report. Thebbject has been to identify, within each programme,modified interpretations or actual policy changes which would be feasible.21. Within some programmes it has been possibleto identify and to cost separately more than onevariant, sometimes several, which could producesavings. In some such programmes these need tobe read as alternatives in the sense that, while oneor perhaps more might be adopted, it is not thoughtfeasible in all cases to implement all the variantsrelating to one programme because of the severity of their cumulative effect. The summary table below therefore also needs to be read in the sense that a total of  x million against a programme doesnot necessarily represent a feasible cut of thatSECRET		5141844	B* 2	
amount, but rather the total of a range of alterna-tivesi some but not all of which might be adopted.In the case of Defence, the figures of plannedexpenditure on existing policies in Part 2, togetherwith the costed variants, have been assessed by theTreasury on a provisional basis and the implications-tions are still under examination.22. With these reservations in mind, and takingfor simplicity only the 1977-78 figures, the extentof the range of possible reductions which could beconsidered may be summarised as follows. (Withthe same reservations, the figures in columns A and b are additive, except as indicated in the note to education and libraries.)TABLE 2		  million	A	B	From a		modified	From a	interpretation	change	of existing	of policy	policy	Defence budget.....Overseas aid.....Agriculture, fisheries and forestry .Research Councils, etc.       .      .   &apos; .Trade, industry and employment  .Nationalised industries&apos; capital expenditureRoadsSurface transport       ....Housing......Miscellaneous local services .Law and order.....Arts&quot;? . ..&apos; . . . .Education and libraries....Health and personal services .Social security.....Maplin defermentChannel Tunnel.....35C)15(2)15610736(&apos;)60204731514211552176(3)6115464C)24(5)834C1) Implications dependent on further study see paragraphs 7-9 of the section on defence budget in Part 2.(2) A modified approach to selective assistance to industry could also lead to a reduced callon the contingency Reserve.(3)  10 million of these variants overlap those under A.(4) Of this total about  35 million would, in the Treasury&apos;s view, arise on expenditure byNew Towns Authorities and the British Airports Authority see Special Analysis 6 in Part 2 but this part of the total is not agreed with Departments.(5) 24 million represents the estimated expenditure by British Railways during 1977-78 on providing a rail link to the Tunnel. Expenditure in the United Kingdom by the private interests who would build the Tunnel itself would be about  65 million during that year.This would be Government guaranteed finance but it does not technically count as public expenditure for the purposes of the review. If the Tunnel were not built some extra public expenditure on ports and British Rail ships would be required towards the end of the PESCperiod.VI.  CONCLUSIONS23. It is the general message of this report that,in order to pursue a consistent taxation policy andto accommodate the claims on resources entailed by the need to achieve fast economic growth andto assist the fight against inflation, some reduction is needed in public expenditure as at present planned.24.  Ministers will wish to consider:(i) whether they agree to aim at a net reduc-tion of  800 million in the costings for1977-78, with the implication of a lowerpath in the two preceding years, and a lower rate of growth of expenditure over the period as a whole;(ii) whether any, and, - if so, which of the additions listed in Annex B should beadmitted to the programmes;(iii) what modifications of policy should be made(drawing on the preceding section of thisreport and Annex Q in order to secure the selected lower rate of growth of expenditure.

Annex AComparisons with costings in Cmnd. 51781. The differences between costings in Cmnd. 5178and those in the present Report are due mainly tothe inclusion in the programme figures of items which were treated as potential claims on the contingency Reserve in Cmnd. 5178. the breakdown between this category, policy changes including the cuts announced on 21st May andestimating changes is summarised below.  million at 1973 Survey prices1972 1973-73    -741974-751975-761976-77I.

Tables 5 to 7 following shows in some detail theareas of expenditure where changes in programmeprovision have been necessary. The nature and status of the items in the first special category,covering expenditure formerly in the contingency reserve, are described more fully in footnote (3)to paragraph 5 in Part 1.3. Policy changes relate to decisions made sincepublication of Cmnd. 5178. The most important ofthese are the Chancellors announcement of cuts on21st May 1973 (page 10), additions agreed for housing, the cost of which is to be met partly fromthose cuts, and the 1973 uprating for social security.Another large area of additional expenditure relates to measures costing about  60 million a year insupport of prices  and incomes policy.    these measures are spread over a number of programmes and are summarised in Special Analysis 8 in Part 2of the Report.4. The programmes mainly affected by revised estimates of the cost of existing policies areagriculture; trade and industry; nationalised industries&apos; capital expenditure; housing; roads anddebt interest. For agriculture higher world food prices reduce the need to operate price guarantees.The trade and industry block is affected by revisedassumptions about the take-up of regional develop-ment grants and assistance under the local employment Act and the rephasing of refinancingof export and shipbuilding credit.5. The main reasons for lower estimates for nationalised industries&apos; expenditure are changes inassumptions about demand for energy, modernisa-tion of the steel industry and procurement of aircraft.The substantial shortfall in expenditure on roads in1972-73 is mainly due to strikes in the construction industry leading to slippage of some major road schemes and a pause in land purchase for futureroad schemes.6. The largest estimating reduction in housing expenditure falls on investment. More houses havebeen and will be sold (particularly in 1972-73 byNew Towns Corporations) and there is a substantial reduction in the number of new approvals (about120,000 a year in Cmnd. 5178 reducing to 95,000in this Survey). There is increased provision forsubsidies to housing authorities under the housing finance Act 1972 (reduction in 1972-73) and it is assumed that up to 1974-75 there will be asubstantial increase in the take-up of improvement grants paid to private individuals.7. Debt interest is calculated on a conventionalbasis. The increases compared with Cmnd. 5178are mainly due to higher average interest rates in1972-73 which for the purposes of this projectionare assumed to continue.TABLE 5Major items of expenditure treated in Cmnd. 5178 as a charge on the Contingency Reserve,but now included in the programme line(*)_   million at 1973 Survey prices1972-73       1973-741974-751975-761976-77Social security upratings(2).....Support to British Railways BoardAssistance to the Coal Industry    .      .      .      .Defence Budget:Northern Ireland and improvement in recruitmentAbolition of Purchasing (Repayment) Service VotesSterling area guarantees      .      .      .41852233110588013114024242140703941107281295491(&apos;) For the status of the italicised figures, see footnote (3) to paragraph 5 in Part 1.(2)The figures in this line include both the provision earmarked in the Contingency Reserve in Cmnd. 5178 (being the cost of anearnings uprating in 1975-76 only) plus additional provision for assumed earnings upratings for the long-term benefits only in eachyear from 1974-75 on.SECRET141844C* 2

There is the possibility of similar assistance to other industries including the Scottish Electricity Boards, British GasCorporation, the British Railways Board and the Post Office, but this cannot be quantified.(2) The Department of Health and Social Security consider that further provision is likely to be needed in the social security programme for, in particular, benefit for the disabled (currently the subject of a PAR) and for one-parent families (currently being considered bythe Finer Committee).  The amounts cannot yet be estimated.defence. The Ministry of Defence point out that theDefence Budget figures for 1976-77 wereacknowledged in Cmnd. 5178 to be provisional only;that CP (73) 8 recognised that Defence could, on present policies, need perhaps another  100 millionabove this provisional figure; and that, at the timeCmnd. 5178 decisions were takexi, the cost of theprogramme in 1977-78 was known to be likely to be higher than in previous years. The Defence Budgetfigures in Part 2 for 1976-77 and 1977-78 arenevertheless both based on the provisional Cmnd.5178 figure for 1976-77 and this largely accounts forthe size of the figures in Table 8 for these two years.Overseas aid2. The addition proposed would allow the &quot; true &quot;aid programme to be increased by 9 per cent in1977-78 as in the previous 3 years. The ODAconsider that this would represent no more thanexisting policy.
Employment services . The Department of Employment proposegreater expenditure on the Training OpportunitiesScheme because length of courses is greater than previously forecast. It is also proposed that a newtarget figure for trainees should be adopted. Thefigures assume the assisted area training grants scheme is wound up. Subject to review of theCommunity Industry Scheme DE proposecontinuation after 1974-75 with more employees.Additional measures for labour mobility have beenagreed in principle. There is a residual additional expenditure which the Department is claiming.Surface transport4. The Department of the Environment considerthat increased provision should be made for surface transport infrastructure if existing plans for improvements in commuter areas are not to be held up.Miscellaneous local services. Ministers have not yet agreed the level of allowances to be paid to local authority elected members and in the view of the Treasuryexpenditure should be offset by savings elsewhere.Legal aid. The Lord Chancellors Office consider that the1970 relativity between supplementary benefits andthe disposable income limits for legal aid should be restored and maintained. The figures are lower than those set out in Part 2 of the Report following a later revision of the cost estimates by the law society.Urban programme. The Home Secretary has put forward theseproposed additions.Education Scotland8. The Scottish Education Department considerthat additional capital provision for leisurefacilities is required in the North-East of scotland as a consequence of North Sea oil developments.Local authority health current expenditure. DHSS and the Welsh Office propose a growth rate of 3  per cent for the local authority health services when, following their integration into the reorganised health services, responsibility for them is transferred to central Government. They note that the 2-6 per cent growth rate provided for inTable 20 of Part 2 is below the growth rate atpresent achieved by local authorities (4 per cent) andthat planned for the hospital service (3  per cent).Property Services Agency10. The additions proposed by the PSA are  25million (in 1975-76 and 1976-77) on the creationof a Greater Parliament Square;  2 - 8 million a year from 1974-75 on modernising accommodation in existing Government offices; and the remainder toprovide offices for a &quot; Hardman &quot; dispersal.Improved transfer allowances11. The Civil Service Department has proposedimproved transfer allowances for non-industrial civilservants, including an element in respect of&quot; Hardman &quot; dispersal. The expenditure would bespread over a number of programmes.Mid-term Census of population12. No decision has yet been taken on a mid-termCensus in 1976.Flour stockpiling13. It has not yet proved possible to find off-setting savings in 1974-75 and later years to finance the proposed programme for building up the flourstockpile.
Annex G:Lower costed variantsThe purpose of this part of the report is to summarise the range of lower costed variantsidentified and described in more detail in theindividual programmes set out in Part 2. Table 9shows the areas where reductions might be possible by modifying the interpretation of existing policies.Table 10 shows reductions which might be achieved if alternative policies were agreed.The paragraphs below reflect departments&apos; views ofthe implications of making reductions of the orderquoted.1.   DefenceTables 9 and 10. Until a full analysis of the 1973Long-Term Costing has been completed it isimpossible to say in detail what the implications ofthe two alternatives would be. The Ministry ofDefence are in no doubt, however, that the effectof the cuts proposed would be to require major changes in existing policies and commitments.2.   Other Military Defence Nil3.   Overseas AidTable 10 figures imply an average rate of increase in line with assumed growth in GNP but would bebelow the lower average level envisaged in Cmnd.5178. Alternative paths between this GNP growth rate and &quot; present policy &quot; could also be envisaged.There is disagreement between the Treasury andODA about &quot; present policy &quot; proposals and ODA&apos;s objections apply a fortiori to any reduction ingrowth rate below the 8 -1 per cent proposed bythe Treasury as representing the upper limit ofexisting policy.4.   e.c. and Other Overseas Services Nil5. Agriculture, Fisheries and ForestryIn the view of the Agricultural Departments, the table should not be interpreted as suggesting thatall these variants are collectively on offer. Thegreater the number of variants adopted, the more severe become the implications of what amounts toa very substantial reduction in the level ofagricultural support. It has been decided that the saving of  25 million in 1974-75 will be found from amongst some of the items listed. Until the precise method of saving this sum has been determined it is not possible to say just what the repercussions in later years would be.6.   Research councils the alternative in Table 10 implies a reduction ingrowth from 3 per cent to about 2 per cent, thoughDES do not agree that this is an acceptablealternative.7. Trade, Industry and EmploymentTable 9 includes  10 million a year savings inselective regional assistance by altering the relevantcriteria. DTI consider that such a change wouldin fact involve a change in policy. The other DTIreductions in Tables 9 and 10 cover a number ofalternatives which, in DTI&apos;s view would, in varying degrees have adverse effects on regional policy or industrial efficiency. The greater part of savings on Employment services would be in traininggrants which in DE view would seriously affectrelationships with the Industrial Training Boards.The other savings would affect the present programme of development in the employment service and industrial relations.8.  FuelFor the NCB the figure in Table 10 implies areduction of 10 per cent in forecast coal output in1977-78, with further savings in assistance to thecoal industry (see Programme 7 in Table 10). Therewould be offsetting expenditure by way of social security etc.; and possible adverse effects on labour relations and security of fuel supply. for electricity DTI consider that the least harmfulalternative option would be to impose cuts of about 85 million within the period within existingstrategies; however they stress that security ofsupplies would be jeopardised and operating costsincreased. The Scottish Economic Planning Depart-ment do not consider that postponement of anytransmission or distribution schemes in the NSHEB&apos;sarea is acceptable because of serious risk to supplies. Capital savings by the Gas Corporationthrough forgoing supplies of North Sea Gas wouldbe very considerably offset by necessary alternativeinvestment which cannot at present be quantified.DTI emphasise the need not to make cuts whichwould be inconsistent with the decisions ministers will take in the context of the energy review.9.  SteelThe main effect of deferments proposed would beon bsc&apos;s production costs and product quality,making them more vulnerable to foreigncompetition.10.  Post OfficeTelecommunications expenditure could be cut bydeferring profitable investment in new facilities.The main option for Posts envisages a deferment ofthe new Post Office Headquarters building.11.  Airways and AirportsReduction in investment by the British AirwaysBoard implies a reduction in capacity with thepossibility ;of a considerable loss of potentialearnings and profits.   It has not been possible to
relate a reduction in BAA expenditure to specificprojects, but it would affect standard of service andthus the competitive position of BAA airports. Theeffect of postponing Maplin is shown in SpecialAnalysis 6 in Part 2 of the report.12.  Surface Transport IndustriesMost BRB investment is being considered in the context of the rail policy review and the onlyoptions relate to the possible postponement of theMaplin rail link.13.  RoadsDOE consider that for England cuts of the levelsincluded in Table 10 (which are after taking accountof cuts for housing) would distort the flow of workon motorways, trunk and principal roads. InScotland at least one major scheme in Glasgowwould be severely delayed and existing standards of road maintenance would be severely affected.14.  Surface transport the option in Table 10 includes a possible reductionof grants for railway research other than the advanced Passenger Train (APT)., Provision for four additional prototype APTs is retained, thoughthe future of this new train depends on the outcome of the Railway Policy review. There are additional savings on infrastructure expenditure, though DOEsay that these would be inconsistent with the policyof giving increasing support to public transport.15.  Housing NilBut postponing Maplin could have an effect onMaplin New Town expenditure for which seeSpecial Analysis 6 in Part 2 of the Report.16.  Miscellaneous Local ServicesReductions in capital expenditure could beachieved by withholding loan sanctions for water and sewerage projects and reducing local authorities&apos;allocations for environmental services in the locally determined sector. There would .be slight conse-quential savings in current expenditure. This would create problems for Departments in their relationship with local authorities. The effect of lower expendi-ture on research would depend on the projectsdeferred or dropped, but DOE attach considerable importance to maintaining the figures included forthe 1973 Survey.17.  Law and OrderTable 9 includes a possible rephasing of capitalexpenditure on forensic science laboratories.Deferment of one of two major prison buildingschemes in Scotland would lengthen the period ofover-crowding of prisoners. For higher courts itmight be possible to accommodate within Cmnd.5178 figures some schemes already approved bypostponing! site purchases and building. Thevariant in Table 10 for prison building in Englandand Wales assumes abandonment of one major andone smaller scheme and deferment of 6 others withrepercussions in general level of overcrowding etc.18.  ArtsThe alternative is a lower rate of growth inrecurrent expenditure by the Arts Council.19. Education and LibrariesWhatever public criticism the proposals in Table 9might arouse, they could be justified as being no more than modifications in existing policy. Themore drastic alternatives in Table 10 would howeverinvolve an overt change in the existing policies on educational expenditure, which were authoritativelydefined in Cmnd. 5174 and Cmnd. 5175; it istherefore likely that they would involve strong criticism. Raising of the school meal charge would need to be considered in the context of the government&apos;s counter-inflation strategy.20. Health and Personal Social services a reduction of the rates of growth to achieve thehospital recurrent expenditure savings in Table 10would involve postponing improvements in accom-modation and treatment. Local authorities current expenditure reductions would fall on preventiveand domiciliary services unless authorities leavenew residential accommodation unused. Capitalexpenditure reductions would slow down closing of old workhouses and building homes for thephysically and mentally handicapped and childrenneeding care.21.  Social security the savings in Table 10 imply a policy that thelong-term benefits will not be increased in line with earnings but that their real improvement will beheld back to the l\ per cent safety margin overprices which is assumed for the short-term benefits.DHSS do not regard this policy as acceptable.22.  Financial AdministrationTable 10 includes deferment of plant for the RoyalMint at Llantrisant.23.  Common Services Nil.24.  Miscellaneous Services Nil.25.  Northern Ireland Nil.,maplinExpenditure is included in a number of programmes.A summary is in Special Analysis 6 in Part 2. see also Note (4) on page 6 of Part 1:channel tunnelSee Note (5) on page 6 of Part 1.

MODIFICATIONS OF POLICYLocal  authorities  current  expenditure  and  ex-penditure on civil service manpower1.  The deoision to reduce public expenditure in1974-75 by  500 million and in  1973-74 byapproaching  100 million poses certain problems forthe expression in subsequent years of the cost of&quot;existing policies&quot;.   These have been dealt within this Report as follows.2. Where projects have been deferred but kept inthe programme at later dates, this has not in generalbeen allowed to produce any net increase in the total programme figure for 1975-76 onwards. Wherethe decisions on 1974-75 have entailed removingfrom a programme particular capital projects whichextended beyond 1974-75, the expenditure on thoseprojects has been removed also from the programme for any later year, and expenditure on other projectshas not been substituted for it.3. Some of the decisions on 1974-75 related toreduction of the current expenditure of localauthorities. The levels of this expenditure for the subsequent years have been retained in all the tablesof this report as they stood for each service beforethose decisions. But this is not to say that theseprojections represent policy in the same sense as before. For example, in some services the decisions on 1974-75 involved reducing capital expenditureof local authorities; and to the extent that growth of current expenditure is determined in these services by anterior capital expenditure, that growthwill tend to be overstated by retaining the current expenditure figures unchanged. On the other hand,in some services the decisions on 1974-75 involvedreducing expenditure on maintenance, and in the subsequent years some provision may need to bemade, as capacity allows, for arrears to be made good.4. If, however, total current expenditure of localauthorities were actually to revert, as in the figures in the tables of this Report, to the level originallyprojected for 1975-76, this would imply a sharprise in recruitment of local authorities&apos; staff in1975-76 to make good deceleration of recruitmentimposed by the squeeze on the previous year, and a sharp rise, of some  348 million (6-7 per cent in real terms) (instead of the  258 million 4-9 percent originally envisaged) in the total of current expenditure of local authorities between 1974-75and 1975-76. This implies in turn either a sharprise in local authorities&apos; rates in the spring of 1975,or an equivalent enlargement of rate support grant,or some mixture of the two. On the other hand, ifthese results (or similar ones in later years) are tobe avoided as conflicting with policy as hithertoenvisaged, this would imply some reduction in the forecasts of local authorities&apos; current expenditure as originally projected. A simple adjustment would beto preserve the original rates of increase but to applythem to the reduced level of this expenditure in1974-75, thus:Total Local Authorities&apos; Current Expenditure^)  million at 1973 Survey prices		1974	1975	1976	1977		-75	-76	-77	-78A.	As in the tables of this					report	5,180	5,528	5,782	6,034B.	Alternative projection	5,180	5,433	5,683	5,929The implications of moving towards alternative Bare set out in terms of the policies for each service in the commentaries in Part 2 of this report whichdraw attention to the difficulties of ensuring that local authority expenditure is held down to thesefigures. In any case final decisions on 1974-75cannot be taken until the rate support grant negotiations with the local authorities are broughtto a conclusion in the autumn and Ministers decide on the level of rate support grant. While it isnot possible to be precise about this element ofpublic expenditure Ministers will wish to considerthe desirable level of expenditure within the limits of the two lines set out above.5. The decision to reduce current expenditure ofthe central Government in 1974-75 by containing the growth of the civil service produces a similarproblem. In this case also the projections for theyears after 1974-75 on which in any case there isno Ministerial commitment at this stage have been left unchanged in the tables in this report. this implies both that the difficulty of recruitment whichhas reduced the starting figure for April 1973 is assumed not to persist, and also that ministers would be prepared to relax the policy of severerestriction of growth. If the contrary is assumedfor the sake of comparison the results are asfollows:Total wages and salaries of the Civil Service  million at 1973 Survey prices1974 1975 1976 1977-75     -76     -77     -78A.

See also Annexes A and Bto Part 1.1. The figures in the above table for 1974-75onwards are at present provisional, pending thecompletion of analysis of the 1973 Long TermCostings. The Defence Budget figures for 1973-74-1976-77 are those in Cmnd. 5178 revaluedplus the additions given in Cmnd. 5178 asconsequences of the abolition of the Purchasing(Repayment) Services Votes (i.e. cashflow adjust-ment), and certain other agreed estimating and policy changes.2. The agreed estimating changes fall into three groups:(i) revised forecasts of expenditure on measures approved as part of the programme to stimulate employment. Taken togetherthese involve increases of  10-4 million in1974-75,  2-3 million in 1975-76, and  1-4 million in 1976-77;(ii) for 1974-75, estimates of the extra costsarising from improvements in recruiting andpeacekeeping operations in Northern Ireland( 58-2 million). No provision for these items has been included for subsequent years, but it has been agreed that theamounts required will be allowed when thetime comes if the continuing need for these items of expenditure can be shown.Provisional estimates of the costs of these items, which are potential claims againstthe Contingency Reserve, are  54-3 million in 1975-76,  53-8 million in 1976-77, and 47 million in 1977-78;(iii) a miscellaneous group, mainly the increasesconsequent upon the abolition of the purchasing (Repayment) Services Votes.3.  The agreed policy changes consist of:(i) estimates of the cost of relocating certaindefence facilities now at Shoeburyness topermit progress on the Third London Airport( 12-3 million in 1974-75,  17-9 million in1975-76, and  17-9 million in 1976-77);(ii) reductions of  2-8 million in each of 1974-75 and 1975-76, and of  2-3 million in1976-77 following the premature repaymentin 1972-73 of certain United States military aircraft loans;(iii) increases of  4 million in 1974-75 and 6-0 million in 1975-76 arising out of the acceleration of payments to shipbuilders for naval construction work;(iv) the effect on the Defence Budget in 1973-74 and 1974-75 (- 10 million and - 60million at 1973 Survey prices respectively)of the measures announced by the chancellor on 21st May. These figures include thedefence element of the savings in civilservice manpower ( 4 million in each year).4. The Ministry of Defence consider that, if thefigures are to reflect accurately the cost of present policy, they need to be increased to include the 73 million (at 1973 Survey prices) which MinistersCONFIDENTIAL
agreed the Ministry of Defence could add, for planning purposes, to the Cmnd. 5178 figures for1976-77. This together with the provision for northern Ireland and recruiting already referred to inparagraph 2(h) and certain other special additions,would raise the Defence Budget totals in the first line of Table 1 above to:  million1974-75	1975-76	1976-773,385	3,550	3,620		The totals have	been arrived	at only after a vigorous scrutiny of the programme.5. The Treasury, on the other hand, believe thatit is inconsistent with Ministers&apos; earlier decisions about Defence Budget figures to make the planningaddition for 1976-77 and the other special additionsreferred to in paragraph 4, on both of which theChancellor has specifically reserved his position.Furthermore, the Treasury consider that if the concept of the Defence Budget as a block budget is to be preserved, the Ministry of Defence, whoenjoy the flexibility which the block budget confers,must also accept its concomitant discipline; andthat the additions in this paragraph should be contained within the figures in Table 1 above.6. No final judgment, however, on the appropriatelevel of defence expenditure in any of these years,or in 1977-78, will be possible until analysis of the1973 long-term costings is complete and has beenconsidered in the context of the general public expenditure situation. In the meantime theTreasury have proposed that the provisional figure for 1976-77 should be repeated for 1977-78. TheMinistry of Defence consider that this gives aseriously misleading impression of the requirementsof the present defence programme which would bemore realistically reflected by a provisional roundfigure of  3,700 million.COSTED VARIANTS7. Thus there are contingent items and unresolvedissues involving the following additional bids:  million1975-76 . : . . . 1181976-77 . . . . 1961977-78   .      .      .      .2768. As a result there is no single set of figuresrepresenting an agreed costing of existing policy,and it is therefore difficult to frame costed variantswithout a firm set of base figures to which theywould apply. On the basis of the Defence Budgetfigures in Table 1, the Treasury have postulated a1 per cent reduction as a modified interpretation of existing policies and a 2 per cent reduction as analternative policy approach in order to establishwhat the practical implications would be. Thiswould produce the following figures:  million at 1973 Survey prices	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78Modified interpretation of			existing policies     .	3,393	3,389	3,389Alternative policy implications-			tions    .      .      .	3,353	3,353	3,3539. Pending the completion of full analysis of the1973 Long-Term Costings an agreed statement onthe implications of these two alternatives cannot bemade. But the figures in Table 1 do not, in theMinistry of Defence&apos;s view, reflect the cost of thepresent programme, figures for which are given inparagraph 4. Large cuts would be required if the table 1 figures had to be accepted. On the same basis the cuts which would be necessary for thevariants are not 1 per cent and 2 per cent butaverage 5 per cent and 6 per cent respectively ofthe paragraph 4 figures, and reach 8 per cent in1977-78. The Ministry of Defence consider thatsuch cuts would require major changes in existing policies and commitments.

Provision is also included forassistance to security forces in the United ArabEmirates. The forecasts for 1973-74 and 1974-75also include provision for capital aid to a fewcountries, notably Singapore, Kenya and Malawi. Inview of the Malaysian Government^ wish that thebulk of the remaining Special Defence Aid provided under the 1968 Arrangements should be used for economic purposes, the provision previously madefor this in 1973-74 under this sub-programme hasbeen reduced. The amount to be spent by Malaysiafor economic purposes will be contained within the overseas Aid programme.2. The need for military aid, in particular theprovision of loaned British service personnel and capital equipment, fluctuates and new requirementscannot be forecast.Allied services . The main items are the cost of accommodation for Ministry of Defence headquarters staff, super-annuation for the Ministry&apos;s civilian staff and services provided by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Officeand Central Office of Information (stationery and recruitment publicity).

The adjustment (line b.) represents the differencebetween the two figures.1. The figures above for the Overseas Aid pro-gramme up to 1976-77 represent the revalued truelevel shown on page 24 of Cmnd. 5178. the adjustments to the true programme allowed for in cmnd. 5178 (to permit increased expenditure in theearlier years, matched by reductions later) are nolonger likely to be required and have been dropped.For 1977-78 the Treasury proposal of  376-3 million is based on an increase of 5-5 per cent inthe aid programme over the preceding year. the overseas Development Administration dissent and seek an increase of 9 per cent to  388-8 million.(Both figures exclude a further  4 - 7 million netinvestment by the CDC.)2. The differing views on 1977-78 representdiffering interpretations of present policy. The mainpolicy considerations are:(a) The Prime Minister undertook, at the united nations General Assembly in 1970, that theUnited Kingdom would do its best to reach the target of at least 1 per cent of GNP for total resource flows to developing countries(official aid, other official flows and privateflows) by 1975.(b) The Minister of State for the Foreign and commonwealth Office stated, at the united nations Second Committee in 1972, that should it appear that we might fall short ofthe 1 per cent in the mid-1970s we wouldcertainly consider further increases in our aid programme.(c) In the e.c. Summit Communique (Cmnd.5109) Member States were invited to adoptpolicies which included an increase in thevolume of official aid.3. The ODA consider that since the present government has approved a 9 per cent increase inthe final year of each of the three public expenditure white Papers published since it took office, &quot; existing policy &quot; implies an increase of 9 per cent once again in 1977-78.4. In the Treasury view the three annual increaseseach of 9 per cent have further improved theprospect that we shall continue to hit the 1 per centtarget (paragraph 2(a) and (b) above), and were intended to that end. The Treasury consider that a9 per cent rate of annual increase for a prolonged period could not be sustained and would go beyondthe requirement of announced policy. The onlyquantified Government undertaking is to try to reach the 1 per cent target by 1975. The total proposedrepresents an estimated 0-45 per cent of GNP in1977-78, and is thus well above the percentage (0-42per cent &quot;true&quot; 0-40 per cent actual) judgedadequate last year in order to reach the 1 per centtarget in 1975-76. It represents a rise in the propor-tion of estimated GNP over 1976-77 (0-45 per cent over 0-44 per cent).COSTED VARIANTS5. As shown in paragraph 2 above, the mainpolicy determinant is our endeavour to reach the target of at least 1 per cent of GNP in 1975-76
and thereafter. In addition, Ministers committed themselves on coming into office to an expandingaid programme and the Summit Conferenceendorsed an increase in the volume of official aidby its members.  Further:(a) Cmnd. 5178 produced an apparent average annual rate of increase for overseas aid as awhole between 1972-73 and 1976-77 of 4-2 per cent (representing 4-6 per cent for the aid Programme element as such). This was however the result of increases in the earlier years matched by reductions in the later years and did not reflect the policy for the&quot; true &quot; aid programme, which was shown in cmnd. 5178 to have a rate of increase ofover 7 per cent a year. Similarly in thelatest review by Ministers in C(73)8, the rateof increase identified for overseas aidbetween 1971-72 and 1976-77 was 5-8 percent a year but the corresponding figure forthe &quot; true &quot; aid programme measured over that span would be 7 per cent.(b) At the Third United Nations Conference on trade and Development (UNCTAD III) andother international conferences, and inParliament, Ministers have referred to the plans already announced (Cmnd. 5178 and earlier public expenditure White Papers) as showing an increase in net official aid flowsboth in real terms and &quot; we believe as a percentage of GNP in the next three to fouryears&quot;. References have also been made by united Kingdom delegates at international conferences to the annual average rise of per cent as well as to the 9 per cent rise ineach of the last three years, for the true aid programme in Cmnd. 5178. In addition, thehigher rates of increase ((a) above) in contrast to the rate for public expenditure as a whole has been stressed.(c) In defending internationally the UnitedKingdom&apos;s refusal to accept the proposed0-7 per cent of GNP target for official aidflows to developing countries we havestressed the greater importance and realismpresented by plans which provide for actualincreases over the years immediately ahead.We have supported this by references to united Kingdom published plans. Weindicated that the United Kingdom believes that official aid should form a substantial part of total flows counting to the 1 per cent of GNP target, as well as a substantial partbeing met by private flows.6. The Treasury&apos;s &quot; present policy&quot; proposals inparagraph 1 would result in an average annual increase of 8-1 per cent over the whole survey period.

(0-38)	(0-38)	(0-38)	(0-38)	(0-37)The Treasury consider a 6-5 per cent rate to be consistent with &quot; present policy &quot;, in that it shows a steady rise each year in the percentage share of gnp, and represents an increase in the volume of official aid over the level preceding and current atthe time of the Summit Communique.    While
recognising that these figures would represent areduction on future plans as published at the timeof the Summit Communique, the Treasury considersthat a lower rate of increase is equally consistent with the United Kingdom&apos;s obligations under the summit Communique. The ODA however considerthat this run of figures would imply a clear change from the stance taken at UNCTAD III and the summit. The Treasury also consider that a 5 percent average rate could be presented as not inconsistent with &quot; present policy &quot; because it wouldbe higher than the adjusted aid programme shownin Cmnd. 5178 although below the &quot; true&quot;programme. The ODA however would not accept that the adjusted programme was a correct inter-pretation of &quot; policy &quot;. A 3 - 5 per cent average rate would be in line with the assumed growth in GNPbut would be clearly below the lower average levelenvisaged in Cmnd. 5178. The average annual increase between 1968-69 and 1972-73 (estimatedoutturn) was 2 - 5 per cent.7. In regard to any level lower than thosediscussed in paragraphs 1-4 above, ODA observe that there is no certainty that private flows will grow parallel with the rise in GNP. They therefore consider that the proportion of GNP devoted to official aid would at least have to be maintained ifwe were to feel reasonably certain of attaining the1 per cent target throughout the period. There isin the ODA view no case for going below thefigures proposed, and the percentages forecast,under &quot; present policy&quot;. There will be constant pressure on donors to increase the percentage of gnp.  At the time of the Summit 0-41 per cent of gnp was the latest known level of official aid.That level will fall to 0-38 per cent this year onthe Cmnd. 5178 figures but with the proposed 9per cent increase would recover by 1974-75 andreach about 0-46 per cent in 1977-78. Forcalendar years the percentage reached 0-44 per centin 1967 and has continued with 1968 0-40 per cent,1969 0-39 per cent, 1970 0-37 per cent, 1971 0-41per cent, 1972 0-39 per cent. The 3-5 per centaverage line in paragraph 6 would therefore givepercentage figures below all except one year of thelast six years, the 5 per cent average line would bebelow the average performance of those six yearsand the 6-5 per cent level would be equal to thataverage.8. The Treasury point out, however, that the levelof 0-41 per cent of GNP in 1971 included an extraallocation towards relief in Bangladesh and that our per cent undertaking does not apply before the mid-1970s. The levels for 1975-76 (the target year)judged tolerable in Cmnd. 5178 in relationto this undertaking were 0-40 per cent actual,0-42 per cent true; given the uncertainty in the forecasts of private flows, something near to thesefigures in 1975-76 should be tolerable, and it isa matter of judgement how near. In consideringalternative lower levels consistent with present policy, the important factors are:(a) a  level  by   1975-76  judged  adequate to achieve the 1 per cent target on existingforecasts of private flows in that year; and(b) a rise thereafter consistent with a publicposture of an increasing aid programme withsome increase in its share of GNP if possible.4.  e.c. and other overseas services table 4   million at 1973 Survey prices1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 1971-72 1972-73 outturn outturn outturn, outturn provisional outturn	1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 estimate estimate estimate estimate estimateContribution to the European Econ-omic Community, etc. (net) .      .                                                  23-3 Overseas representation .      .             82-3     80-1     83-0     84-2     85-3 Overseas information     .      .      .       38-2     38-0     37-5     37-7     38-3 Other external relations .      .      .      42-1     40-7     38-6     40-8     45-7 Sterling area guarantees ...                                                  40-8	105-0    135-0    175-0    215 0    275 0 87-8     90-8     92-2     92-1     89-9 39-7     40-4     40-6     39-0     38-6 45-6     46-1     46-7     47-3     47-6 22-0Total       .      .      .     162-6    158-8    159-1    162-7    233-4	300-1    312-3    354-5    393-4    451-1Changes from Cmnd. 5178 revalued: Transfers from Cmnd. 5178 Cont-ingency Reserve to programme                                                +40 - 8 Policy changes       ...                                                 +0-4 Estimating changes ...                                                -18-6 Cmnd. 5178 revalued     .      .                                                        210-8	4-22-0           --01 -0-3 - -4-24-2    -f8-5   +18-6   +17-3 254-0    304-1    335-9    376-1

Overseas Representation4. This expenditure includes the cost of theForeign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) inLondon, British diplomatic and consular representa-tion in more than 120 countries and 7 officialdelegations to international organisations. It covers the cost of staff (excluding those engaged on information work) as well as their office and private accommodation abroad, and official travel.5. Also included in the expenditure figures is thecost of the Overseas Development Administration,confidential the Passport Offices in London and other centres,and the communications organisation in support ofthe Diplomatic Service.Overseas Information6.  This covers three main elements:(a) British Council expenditure to promote widerknowledge of the United Kingdom and theEnglish language abroad and to fostercultural relations with other countries. (Theremainder of the Councils expenditure is included in Overseas Aid.)(b) The cost of the BBCs External Services andassociated expenditure involved in british broadcasting directed to other countries.(c) The cost of information staff at home andabroad and their operational expenses, andof supporting services of the Central Officeof Information and the Stationery Office.7. The first three years of the Survey include thebalance of the additional provision for the expansionof cultural relations with Europe referred to in the1972 Report.8. Compared with the forecasts in Cmnd. 5178revalued, provision has been made for BBC/FCOinformation capital expenditure (mainly on broadcasting) to continue at the current level of 1 - 5 million a year. In addition  4 million (partly offset by savings on recurrent expenditure) has beenprovided over the Survey period to meet the costof replacing the present BBC Far East RelayStation.Other External Relations9. This item consists mainly of expenditure on the- Secret Service, certain Overseas Service pensions and international commitments and subscriptions,including the United Kingdom&apos;s assessedcontributions to regular budgets of United Nationsorganisations and of the Organisation for economic co-operation and Development, the Council ofEurope and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisa-tion (secretariat costs). While every effortcontinues to be made to contain the rate of expansion of such budgets, the forecasts of assessedcontributions payable are based on the mostrealistic assumptions possible at this stage. Provisioncontinues to be made for the voluntary support ofthe United Nations Force in Cyprus.Sterling Area Guarantees10. The guarantee to official holders of sterlingreserves was implemented because of the fall of the sterling exchange rate in October and November1972.&quot; Contributions to the European Communities, etc.1. This comprises United Kingdom contributions to the European Communities&apos; budget; capitalcontributions to the European Investment Bank andthe European Coal and Steel Community; and estimated receipts from the Communities&apos; budget.Receipts by the private sector are not included.2. The main source of forecasts of totalCommunity expenditure is the Commission^ ownthree year forward look which became availablelast autumn, on the basis of which the firstfundamental reassessment of the Communities&apos;budget and the United Kingdom share of it sincefigures were published in July 1971 was carried out and the results were published in Cmnd. 5178.The figures in the table above for the 1973 Surveyare essentially those appearing in Cmnd. 5178 re-valued to 1973 Survey prices, with certain modifications. Receipts from the Agricultural Fundhave been reassessed but their effect is notsignificant; our annual percentage contribution tothe. Communities&apos; budget has been raised slightly totake account of Norway&apos;s decision not to join theCommunity; and our three annual payments to theEuropean Coal and Steel Community have beenrephased so that they fall into the last nine monthsof the calendar year, given that our firstcontribution was not made in first three months ofcalendar year 1973 as had been hitherto expected.In the course of the next few months it is expectedthat there will be cause to make significant revisionsof the figures particularly in the light of decisions taken on expenditure from the guidance section ofthe Agricultural Fund and (towards the end of1973) on regional policy. In addition, as further work is done on estimation of the amount of own resources we are likely to pay over to the communities in 1978, the figure for the final yearmay have to be amended.3. As in Cmnd. 5178, conversion of our contributions from units of account to poundssterling has been at the rate of 2-4 units of account to the  , which is the rate at which contributionsare to be made until the   is refixed.
Non-Financial Data for 1973 White Paper11. The. scope for producing tables or furtherinformation on the relationship of expenditure toneeds is limited, but further consideration is being given to this. It is hoped that it will be possible toproduce, for Overseas Representation;(a) A breakdown of future expenditure into thefollowing   categories:    diplomatic   service(home); diplomatic service (overseas); the passport Office, and ODA;(b) the estimated future breakdown of UnitedKingdom based manpower by area;and, for Overseas Information, a table giving hoursof BBC broadcasting and numbers of languages, bybroad geographical area.5.

The format of the table broadly follows that adopted in Cmnd. 5178 except that expenditure onhorticulture, in line with the treatment under theCommon Agricultural Policy (CAP), has now beenreclassified as part of &quot; Agricultural support&quot; insteadof &quot; Other agricultural and food policies &quot;.price guarantees2. Under the Treaty of Accession the UnitedKingdom market prices for products to which the cap applies must be raised to e.c. levels by sixsteps between 1973 and 1978 and the deficiency round for these products must be ended duringthis period; the guarantees on beef and rye havealready been discontinued and for eggs they wdl end in 1974. The convention adopted in the Survey forprojecting the cost of deficiency payments for CAPproducts is to enter the estimated cost in full in thecurrent year and to phase out this amount over the transitional period. For the non-CAP products, theestimated cost in 1973-74 is projected forwardunchanged. As a result of higher world prices, thecost of the price guarantees has been greatly reduced below the levels projected in Cmnd. 5178 revalued,resulting in a saving of nearly  90 million in 1973-74and  55 million in 1976-77, after allowing for thedeterminations following the 1973 Annual Review ofAgriculture.production   grants   and   subsidies,   includingcapital grants3. The figures for expenditure on production grants and subsidies take account of the decision to secure a saving under this heading of  25 million in1974-75.   Until the precise method of saving this
 25 million has been determined it is impossible tosay what the repercussions in later years would bebut a possible run of figures rising to  39 million in1977-78 has been taken into account in Table 5.Provision has also been made in this table for likelyexpenditure on the two e.c. beef incentive schemesrecently agreed by the Community. This additional expenditure will be considerably less than the savings referred to above^ thereby meeting the agreedprinciple that the United Kingdom expenditure should be offset by domestic savings, although not ata loss to United Kingdom producers generally.4. The cost of the capital grant schemes, principallythe Farm Capital Grant Scheme (FCGS), has beenprojected forward on the basis of existing schemes and rates of grant. No allowance has been made for changes in expenditure arising from the introductionof e.c. schemes, notably the Farm development scheme proposed for the implementation of the EECDirective 72/159, or for any consequential modifica-tions to national schemes. In March 1973, the mainrate of grant under the FCGS was cut from 30 to20 per cent, producing savings of approximately 15 million a year from 1974-75 onwards. Also no allowance is made for a replacement of the horticulture-ture Improvement Scheme which expires in April1974, whether at a national or e.c. level. In total,expenditure on capital grants is forecast to falllromabout  105 million in 1973-74 to about  55 million in 1977-78.market support operations5. Expenditure under this heading relates to the costs of the Intervention Board for agricultural produce in implementing the CAP system of support.These include the costs of intervention buying, thepayment of incentives for storage or denaturing and export refunds. Import levies under the system arecollected by Her Majesty&apos;s Customs and Excise and do not form part of this programme. The expendi-ture forecasts represent the estimated cost of marketintervention operations in the United Kingdom, this being the net cost in the case of commodities boughtinto intervention and subsequently sold. also included is the gross cost of the general buttersubsidy amounting to  16 million in 1973-74 and 18 million in 1974-75, half of which is financed bythe Guarantee Section of the Agricultural Fund. net receipts from the Agricultural Fund are not nettedoff but are set against the contributions to theEuropean Communities see Table 4. Disregardingthe general butter subsidy, the rising trend ofexpenditure reflects the fact that as intervention pricesrise through the transitional period, the level of export refunds, of certain production grants and thevalue of stocks will increase.other agricultural and food policies6. This includes most of the other expenditure by government departments on, for example, agricul-tural research, advisory services, and the eradicationCONFIDENTIALand control of animal disease. It also coversexpenditure on the bacon stabiliser and the consumersugar subsidy which are being terminated early in1973-74. It also includes about  11 million in both1973-74 and 1974-75 for payments to sugar refiners,though this expenditure will be matched by increasedlevy receipts. The outturn for 1972-73 includes 31 million in respect of amounts paid to the milk marketing Boards which the Government hasdecided not to recover from the consumer by raising the retail price of milk. The forecast in the later years of the Survey assumes a continuation of thepolicy of recoupment, taking one year with another.If, however, the retail price were not raised in1973-74, the deficit at the end of the year would beof the order of  75 million or about  43 million ifthe prices were raised by lp a pint from October.And if Ministers again decided not to recover the deficit, the corresponding subsidy to consumerswould be an addition to the expenditure shown in the table.Fisheries7: The main expenditure under this heading relates to subsidies for the fishing industry, grants and loans for new vessels and equipment, research and develop-ment in connection with the industry, fishery protect-tion in Scottish waters and support for trawleroperations in Icelandic waters. The expenditure on some of these depends on operating results, theindustry&apos;s attitude towards capital investment andother factors which cannot be forecast with accuracy.The increased provision for 1973-74 is due mainly to the inclusion of the estimated cost for six monthsof support for trawlers in Icelandic waters, the replacement of a research vessel and the level ofcapital investment in fishing vessels, which rose in1972-73 and is expected to continue at the same ratein 1973-74.Forestry8. This item covers the activities of the forestry commission in promoting in Great Britain theinterests of forestry, the establishment and main-tenance of adequate reserves of growing trees and theproduction and supply of timber. Finance isprovided from the Forestry Fund comprising allsums received from trading and other activities andan annual grant-in-aid. The Survey figures consistof interest on capital, depreciation and the cashrequirement the grant-in-aid; the last item decreasesgradually over the Survey period but the averageis about  14-5 million a year.9. As the State Forestry Enterprise the Commission,in carrying out a combined planting and replantingprogramme of up to 22,000 hectares a year, will increase the size of its forestry estate from about770,000 hectares to about 860,000 hectares at the endof the quinquennium with a plantable reserve ofabout 100,000 hectares.   About 9-6 million cubic11
metres (9 million tons) of timber will be producedand sold. The forestry estate will be improved in theinterests of amenity and its recreational potentialincreased. As the result of changes announced inthe Consultative Document &quot; Forestry Policy &quot; issued in June 1972, the Commission has been set a target rate of return on its notional capital of3 per cent in real terms. The form of its accountsis being revised to bring out its performance inrelation to this target, allowance being made forplanting undertaken for social reasons which isexpected to yield less than the target rate. Theamount of (notional) capital is being substantially reduced. The effect of this reduction on the interestcharged a major element in the Survey figures is to produce substantially lower totals than for pastSurveys, though the interest element continues to beresponsible for the upward trend in the Survey totals.10. As the Forestry Authority the Commissionundertakes research into all branches of forestry,controls felling in private woodlands and providesgrants and technical advice to private woodlandowners. The estimates for grants to the private sector covered by the grant-in-aid do not reflectpolicy changes proposed in the consultative document; these are still the subject of con-consultations.ALTERNATIVE POLICY IMPLICATIONS11. The table shows the costings provided by theAgricultural Departments of technically feasiblealternative policies. They represent coursesinvolving *&quot; alternative policy implications &quot; requiringdecisions by Ministers rather than &quot;modifiedinterpretations of existing policies &quot;. In the mainthe items relate to the elimination or reduction ofexisting statutory schemes for which specific ratesof grant or subsidy apply so the scope for modifiedinterpretation is limited. It has been decided thatthe saving of  25 million in 1974-75 will be found from among items 2, 3, 4i and 4 ii. Exactly how the reduction will be made is yet to be decided butprovisional figures for 1974-75 and the later years have been taken into account in Table 5, seeparagraph 3. In the view of the agricultural departments, the table should not be interpreted as suggesting that all these variants are collectivelyon offer. The greater the number of variantsadopted the more severe become the implications of what amounts to a very substantial reduction inthe level of agricultural support.12.   The following points should be noted:(i) in the case of the FCGS and the Calf Subsidythe savings indicated are additional to the reductions already announced in March 1973;(ii) the Department of Agriculture and Fisheriesfor Scotland consider that, because of thehigher cost of supplying lime to farmers inScotland and their relatively greater depen-dence on it, the lime subsidy should beretained in Scotland even if the scheme isabolished in England and Wales. savings would then be reduced by  1-2 million inthe last three years. The Treasury view isthat to make an exception for Scotland would raise the issue of exceptions in other areas,e.g. Wales.13. No alternative costing has been made for thesupport to hill farmers, currently running at about 33 million a year. The Agricultural Departmentsconsider that the declarations on hill farmingannexed to the Treaty of Accession constitutevirtually a commitment to hill farmers to maintain their incomes in real terms at roughly the levelsobtaining at the time of the Treaty. They considerthat the present rates of assistance should last atleast until there is evidence that store cattle prices are not likely to fall to the levels of 1971-72. Hillfarmers are already affected by the cut in the calfsubsidy and would be affected by a decision to cut the beef cow subsidy and the rates of capital grants.The Treasury consider that savings are feasible inthis area, but accept that further study is requiredto establish the scale and timing of such savings.  million1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-781.

The Secretary of State for Education and science allocates this block budget to research councils and certain other bodies in the light of advice received formerly from the Council for scientific Policy and from 1973 from the advisory board for the Research Councils. From 1973-74 thetransfers from the Science budget to customerDepartments announced in &quot; Framework forGovernment Research and Development&quot; (Cmnd.5046), to which reference was made in &quot; public expenditure to 1976-77 &quot; (Cmnd. 5178), have beenmade. In that year the whole of the transferredmoney is being used by the customer departments to commission research from the Research Councils.The expectation is that the same procedure will apply in 1974-75 and in 1975-76. After thosetransitional years the residual Science budget andthe customer Departments&apos; expenditure on researchcommissioned from the Research Councils will,though connected, be distinct.2. The residual Science budget has been increased in each of the years from 1974-75 onwards by asum of  0-475 million in respect of higher tuitionfees for post-graduate students in receipt of awardsfrom the Research Councils. The additional sumshave not been taken into account in the calculation of the annual growth rates. The rate of growth ofthe Science Budget in 1977-78 is 3 per cent, thesame as in 1976-77.ALTERNATIVE POLICY IMPLICATIONS3. The Department of Education and Sciencehave provided estimates for an alternative lower rate of growth of the Science Budget (an averageof about 2 per cent instead of 3 per cent) for theyears 1975-76, 1976-77 and 1977-78. DES are notin any way agreeable to such a lower rate of growthbeing implemented.  million	1975-76	1976-77	1977-781973 Survey	134-4	138-4	142-5Alternative costing	.    133-9	136-4	138-4Saving	.       0-5	2-0	4-1

Apart from provision for selective assistanceto industry under Part 2 of the Industry Act 1972the Departments forecasts do not allow for possiblenew major projects or support schemes as yetunapproved. These are in principle a claim on the contingency reserve.Industrial Development Executiveregional development grants2. Grants will be made towards the cost of buildings and plant and machinery1 in the specialdevelopment areas and towards the cost of buildings in the intermediate areas, and, until 21st March1974, in the derelict land clearance areas.3. The forecasts are considerably lower than those contained in Cmnd. 5178 revalued. The largestdecrease is in 1973-74 ( 116 million) and is mainly due to applications being submitted more slowlythan expected- Of the net decrease in the period1974-75* to 1976-77 about  25 million to  30 millionstems from a revised estimate of the proportionof total payments which will be made to public corporations, which do not count as part of public expenditure. The forecast rate of building hasalso been affected by the sag in investment in thelatter half of 1972.HHHHBNB&apos; liHHBgexpenditure under the local employment act4. The forecasts take into account the running down of most of the forms of assistance availableto industry under the Local Employment Act 1972.The forecasts are based on the continuing develop-rnent of industrial estates and provision of factoriesbut other forms of assistance under the 1972 Actare expected to have terminated by the end of the survey period. Estimated expenditure on loans and grants and on the provision of land and buildings is now less than Cmnd. 5178 revalued.Expenditure on land and buildings is, however,expected to rise from about  12 million in 1972-73to  17 million in 1973-74 and to  18 million from1974-75 onwards.selective regional assistance5. Provision is made for loans and other formsof assistance to industry in the development and intermediate areas. Of the reduction of about  21million on Cmnd. 5178 revalued, over the period1973-74 to 1976-77, part ( 16 million) is due toreduced estimates and the remainder ( 5 million)to a cut, included in the recent measures announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to be effected by a greater use of interest relief grants rafterthan loans.general assistance to industrySection 8 of Industry Act6. Provision is included both for approved projects and for certain projects still tinder consideratioswhich are expected to be approved. No provisioQis included for possible future projects as ysiunforeseen.   These are a potential call on trc
contingency reserve. As stated in Cmnd. 5178the pattern of expenditure cannot be foreseen atthis stage. The initial limit in the Act for assistance under Section 8 is  150 million for the period upto the end of 1977, which may be increased byOrder by up to  100 million on not more than four occasions.Assistance to 1CL7. Provision is made in 1973-74 for the balanceof the  14-2 million support announced in July1972, and in addition for the further supportrecently agreed by Ministers of  25 - 8 million in theperiod up to September 1976.assistance to the shipbuilding industry8. Apart from minor changes in the forecasts forloan repayments the only variation from Cmnd. 5178revalued is the inclusion in 1973-74 of an additional 7 million for assistance to Cammell Laird Limitedowing to slippage from 1972-73.refinancing of home shipbuilding credit9. The estimates for 1973-74 to 1977-78 consistof two elements. The first is net refinanceprovided to the banks on guaranteed shipbuildingcredit. The second is the takeover by the DTIof a block of existing refinance at present held bythe Bank of England. The estimates reflect a higher level of net refinance, mainly owing to a slowergrowth of current account deposits, than was allowed for in Cmnd. 5178. This is more than offset, however, by a reduction in the provisionfor takeover of the existing block so that the combined effect is a net reduction of  33 million over the period from 1973-74 to 1976-77.tourism10. The forecasts assume some increases overCmnd. 5178 revalued in the grants in aid to theBritish Tourist Authority and the English TouristBoard ( 0-4 million a year). Forecasts for expenditure on tourist projects in the development areas under Section 4 of the Development of tourism Act 1969 have also been increased from 0-5 million to  1-2 million. This is a provisionalfigure. The scope of the scheme, and the longer-term level of expenditure in this area, will dependon decisions taken as a result of the current PARon Tourism.minor industrial sponsorship11. A management budget (i.e. a small blockbudget) is proposed for this area, within which DTIwould have considerable freedom in allocatingexpenditure. They have agreed reluctantly to thelevel shown, since projects to which they are already committed will take up most of this allocation, andthere will be little scope for new schemes.CONFIDENTIALresidual expenditure12. The forecasts for Investment Grants provide for expenditure arising from contracts entered into by industry before 27th October 1970. The totalexpenditure qualifying under these contracts and the phasing of the payments are still uncertain. Therehas, however, been some rephasing since Cmnd. 5178of expenditure on Investment Grants; and also of receipts from the realisation of the assets of theIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation.Civil aviation servicesgrant to civil aviation authority13. As in Cmnd. 5178 the forecasts assume that thegrant to the Authority will decrease over the survey period. The provision for 1977-78 is included at 9 million which is  4 million less than that for1976-77. The progressive reduction in the CAA&apos;sdeficit grant will however depend on their obtainingcorresponding increases in the Authority&apos;s income from charges, and the forecasts are necessarilytentative.capital expenditure by the caa14. The greater part of the Civil aviation authority&apos;s investment programme consists of invest-ment in equipment and installations for the NationalAir Traffic Services. The expenditure will provide,inter alia, new computers for the automation offlight planning; modernised or new navigational aidsat aerodromes and for en route purposes and new buildings and equipment for regional air traffic control centres.15. The forecasts for 1975-76 and 1976-77 are 9 million higher than the estimate in Cmnd. 5178revalued, which was prepared before the authority had had an opportunity to give proper considerationto their programme. The present forecasts reflectmainly the future requirements of the CAA ifpresent standards of air safety are to be maintained,and operating costs are to be reduced. The major part of the increase relates to new equipment Doppler VOR navigational beacons, a control towerat Maplin and various facilities at the Scottish air traffic centre.local authority expenditure on aerodromes16. There is an increase of about  5^ million for theperiod 1975-76 to 1976-77 which is mainly due to proposed new expenditure at Bristol Airport.dti expenditure on civil aviation17. The provision of  0-9 million a year from1973-74 onwards in respect of aircraft security measures is more than offset by the inclusion of receipts from and the reduced contribution to17
euro control. The total decrease on Cmnd. 51&apos;78revalued is about  4 million over the period 1973-74to 1976-77. No provision has been made for additional security measures at present underconsideration.Aircraft and aeroengine projects and assistanceconcorde18. Compared with Cmnd. 5178 revalued, the totalConcorde estimates show a reduction of  9 - 8 million in 1973-74, and  9-1 million in 1974-75, and increases of  0-4 million and  15-8 million in thenext two years. Within these totals there areincreases in development costs of  45 million overthe period 1973-74 to 1976-77 including theestimated cost of work to reduce engine noise. these increases are more than offset by decreases over thesame period of  47-7 million in the forecast ofproduction expenditure (net) as a result of a lowerassumption of aircraft produced. It is assumed thatall the aircraft produced will be sold, orders being placed mainly after Concorde has entered service in1975. The estimates are tentative, pending decisions on the production programme.RB21119. Since Cmnd. 5178 there has been somerephasing of the production programme of theRB211-22 and of the development of the RB211-24which has changed the pattern of expenditure and receipts between the years without increasing total net expenditure in the period 1973-74 to 1976-77.The present estimates are subject to a number ofreservations in respect of, for example, Rolls Royce(1971) Ltd&apos;s forecast of much lower losses on thefirst 555 engines, and possible warranty costs, whichcannot yet be quantified.assistance to rolls royce (1971) ltd20. No provision has been made for possibleacquisition of shares, loan of working capital andthe balance of the purchase price.for acquisition of assets. More working capital may be required but cannot be quantified at present. The balance of thepurchase price of the assets is likely to be paid in1973-74, if a negotiated settlement is reached; inthat event the further payment in addition to the interim payments already made could be of theorder of  60 million.general r and d programme21. This is another area for which a managementbudget is under consideration. Since Cmnd. 5178reductions of  3-0,million in 1973-74 and  1-7 million in 1974-75 have been made, reflectingslower progress on the various projects in the earlier years.other22. Provision has increased since Cmnd. 5178 by 4-6 million,  8-5 million,  14-7 million and 10-9 million in the years 1973-74 to 1976-77.The major increase is in respect of the launching aid for the HS146 aircraft projectrecently provisionally approved by Ministers.23. The reductions in 1974-75 announced by theChancellor of the Exchequer do not directly affectthe estimates for aircraft and aeroengine projects inTable 7 above, but they include a reduction of 13 million in the element in the Cmnd. 5178contingency reserve notionally attributed to newcivil aircraft projects. The effect of this is that theDTI&apos;s potential call on the 1973 Survey contingency reserve for 1974-75, in respect of these projects is limited to  8-3 million. jSpacenational space technology programme24. Pending decisions on an integrated Europeanprogramme the forecasts assume that the NationalSpace Technology Programme will continue duringthe period, and will include development of theGeostationary Technology Satellite for maritimeapplications (GTS-A) using foreign launchers.This does not, however, imply a policy decision as yet in favour of the programme as a whole. Interimauthority to October 1973 has been given for theGTS-A programme.international programmes25. The provision consists almost entirely of the contribution to the ESRO programmes of application satellites for aeronautical, meteorologicaland telecommunications purposes, which was agreed in December 1971, and to the post-Apollo studieson the development of a Space Laboratory.Nuclear energy and other nuclear expenditure26. In aggregate the forecasts for the period1973-74 to 1976-77 are  10-4 million less thanthose in Cmnd. 5178 revalued. This has come about despite increased spending on reactor research and development ( 12-6 million) following thedecisions to continue with the fast reactor and keepopen the options on thermal reactors pending furtherstudies announced by the Secretary of State on 8th August 1972. There is also an increase of 11-3 million in the payments to British NuclearFuels Limited (BNFL) in support of the TripartiteGas Centrifuge project.27. The principal factor in the overall reduction in expenditure is the elimination of the BNFLborrowing requirement of  37-5 million. This isdue to increased direct Government support for theCentrifuge project and the rephasing of theelectricity generating boards&apos; nuclear power station
programme. As against this, the slippage of the nuclear programme has also resulted in a reductionof  20-6 million in the forecasts of receipts fromsales of uranium ore to the generating boards. the forecasts do not however take account of theCentral Electricity Generating Board&apos;s latestnuclear assumptions (see paragraph 8 of the section on Fuel), but it seems unlikely that these assumptions will result in a significant increase insales of ore within the period. The figure for1975-76 also takes account of the forecast receiptof  4-5 million from the sale of shares in BNFL(although the timing of this is still undecided).Reductions on a number of other items account forthe balance of the decrease on Cmnd. 5178revalued.28. The forecasts of reactor R &amp; D are particularlyuncertain: policy on thermal reactor developmentremains to be resolved and it is possible that the fast reactor will make a bigger call on resources thanforecast. There is thus a possible call on the contingency reserve, particularly in the later yearsof the period.Other research and development29. There is an overall reduction of about  3 million on Cmnd. 5178, revalued, over the period1973-74 to 1976-77. This is mainly due to the phasing out of the payment of interest relief grant to the National Research Development Corporation.Provision for extramural research includes work bythe Natural Environment Research Council and theUKAEA and work on marine technology, withparticular reference to R &amp; D in connection with the exploitation of North Sea Oil.Export promotion30. The forecasts are for the period 1974-75 to1976-77 those contained in Cmnd. 5178 revaluedand for 1973-74 the amount agreed for Estimates.For 1977-78 the figure for 1976-77 has been repeated. This is consistent with the recom-mendation of the 1971 PAR that overall expenditureon the Export Promotion Programme should remain at its 1971 level in real terms.31. The Department of Trade and Industryconsider that these forecasts are too low and that increases of the following amounts are required inorder to maintain export promotion services at theirpresent level:  million1973-74    1974-75    1975-76    1976-77    1977-780-8 0-8 1-0 10 10The additional expenditure proposed reflects the review of services carried out by the british overseas Trade Board and the increased responseby industry to the forms of assistance available.It is, in the Departments view, particularly important that there should be no cut-back in services in the early years of the period.Consumer and other services32. This heading brings together certain servicespreviously included in the Administration and miscellaneous headings. It contains the expenditureof the Patent Office, Monopolies Commission andthe Metrication Board; subscriptions to international organisations, including the European Patent Office;expenditure on Standards, Weights and measures and some minor items. On a comparable basis the forecasts are very little different from Cmnd. 5178revalued.Shipping services33. There is an increase of  0-9 million on Cmnd.5178 revalued for the period 1974-75 to 1976-77.The revised forecasts include provision for increased expenditure on improving surveillance of navigationin the English Channel.Nationalised industries special assistanceassistance to the coal industry34. Provision was made in Cmnd. 5178 forassistance to the coal industry up to 1975-76 underpast legislation and under the Coal Industry bill which has now received Royal Assent. Thiscovered grants towards the costs arising from pitclosures, coal stocking, securing supplies of cokefor use by the steel industry and regional grants;payments for promoting the sale of coal to theelectricity generating boards, payments to redundantmineworkers and towards the costs of prematureand increased pensions. The Act provides foraggregate assistance of  490 million (increasable byOrder to  540 million) in the period 1973-74 to1975-76, further increasable by Order by  155million if assistance is to be continued until 1977-78.35. The forecasts of expenditure up to 1975-76 arethose of Cmnd. 5178 and are consistent with boththe intermediate course approved by Ministers andwith the financial limits in the Act. The forecasts are subject to the inevitable uncertainties but duringthis period the regional grant is expected to account for about  165 million and the various measures of social assistance (Redundant Mineworkers&apos; PaymentsScheme, early payment of retirement pension,increased pension and other grants in connection withpit closures) for about  120 million. The estimates for 1976-77 and 1977-78 follow the limits imposed by the Act but may prove to be inadequate. the precise breakdown cannot be quantified but thegreater proportion will be on social assistance.19CONFIDENTIAL
other1 assistance36. The forecasts provide for compensation inrespect of accelerated investment to be paid to the gas and electricity industries. Provision is also madefor a grant of  5 million in 1973-74 towards the costs incurred as a result of the Central electricity generating Board&apos;s decision, following a request from the Government in the interest of security ofsupplies, to hold stocks of ancillary materialssubstantially in excess of the amount justified onnormal commercial considerations. For the period1973-74 onwards  4-7 million a year has been included for the proposed scheme to provide benefits to steelworkers made redundant from January 1973.Administration37. The costs of the Patent Office, monopolies commission and the Metrication Board, previouslyshown under this heading, are now included in&quot; Consumer and other services &quot;. On a comparablebasis there are increases on Cmnd. 5178 revalued,due to the inclusion of provision for the Price Corn-mission; increases in consultancy work, travel inconnection with e.c. entry and expenditure onpromotion of the assisted areas.OTHER DEPARTMENTSEmployment services38. This covers expenditure by the Department ofEmployment on employment and training; by localauthorities on employment services (e.g. shelteredemployment for the severely disabled); and by theDepartment of the Environment on premises. TheTreasury and the Department do not agree on theprogramme except in 1973-74, and the followingtable compares their recommendations:	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-	-77	1977-78Treasury  .	.   150-3	167-4	206-0	207	7	214 0Department	.   150-3	1700	225-4	238	9	255-7Difference .	-i    -- .	2-6	19-4	31	2	41-739. The provision for 1973-74 shows a saving of 4-6 million on Cmnd. 5178 revalued. The pro-gramme so far agreed for 1974-75 to 1976-77is Cmnd. 5178 revalued with the following allow-ances and amendments. First, the Pay Board leads to new expenditure of  0-8 million in 1973-74and  0-9 million a year thereafter. Second,allowance is made for  1-7 million in 1974-75 and 1-8 million in 1975-76 to offset the loss of loanrepayments made earlier than previously forecast.Third, there is a net reduction in 1974-75 to take account of the net saving of  22 million ( 20 million in 1972 prices) on training announced by theChancellor of the Exchequer on 21 May and itassumes the Department will contribute the 1 percent reduction in civil service numbers requiredwithout prejudice to any later negotiations on manpower ceilings. The provision for 1977-78would allow for a 3 per cent increase over 1976-77.40. The 1974-75 programme is not however fullyresolved. Only part of the expansion of the training programme announced for that year has beenprovided for so far, since without the Departmentsagreement to phase out the assisted area traininggrants the full  22 million net saving could not bemaintained. Details of this and the Departmentsremaining additional bids for 1974-75 to 1977^78are set out in the following table and paragraphs 41to 45 below.  million					1974	1975	1976	1977	-75	-76	-77	-78Training Opportunities Scheme	1-6	19-6	310	38-7less Assisted Area Training				Grants    ....	2 0	6-3	8-4	8-4Training net .      .	-0-4	13-3	22-6	30-3Community Industry	1-9	2-3	2-8	2-8Labour Mobility  .	1:1	1-1	11	11Other (mainly estimating)	--	2-7	4-7	7-5Total    ....	2-6	19-4	31-2	41-741. The main increase proposed by the department is in the programme for the Training OpportunitiesScheme which provides training courses of up to ayear in length mainly in Government TrainingCentres and in Colleges of Further Education.Cmnd. 5178 provided for trainees to be increased from 30,000 in 1972 to 64,000 in 1976 and noted inthe commentary the aim of a significant increase in later years. The Department now find that theaverage length of courses in Colleges of further education is greater than they forecast so that extra expenditure is needed if they are to maintain theirpresent training targets. The Secretary of State for employment has also proposed adoption of a newtarget of 95,000 trainees a year by 1978. This, ifapproved, would require expenditure on additionalplaces in Colleges of Further Education as well as more grants. Taking all these factors into account the Department now propose expenditure on thescheme of  103 million compared with the  72million provision for 1976-77 in Cmnd. 5178.42. To offset some of this additional expenditureon the Training Opportunities Scheme the Secretaryof State has further proposed that he should start tophase out this year his scheme for assisted areaTraining Grants in support of training by employers in these areas.  These grants represent only a small
increased the number of persons assisted to transferthough the expenditure is expected to be lower than was then forecast. On the other hand theDepartment^ figures include the provision forfurther improvements discussed in paragraph 44above.48. Details of the Departments occupationalsafety and health services were given in Cmnd. 5178.The Employment Medical Advisory Service was setup early in 1973. The recommendation of theRobens Committee on Safety and Health at workfor an independent statutory Safety and health authority has been accepted and legislation is being prepared. To the new Commission will betransferred various Government inspectorates. the forecasts do not take account of this recentdevelopment, and in particular do not provide forany extra expenditure which might flow from thisdecision.49. The Department also provide specialisedplacing services for disabled persons together withfacilities for rehabilitation in Industrial rehabilitation-tion Units; and they provide grant aid for employ-ment for severely disabled persons in shelteredworkshops. They are undertaking a number ofreviews in this area.50. At present grants are made towards the costof the Youth Employment Service to those localauthorities who have elected to provide it. However,from the dates of local government reorganisationevery local education authority will have a duty toprovide a vocational guidance service for peopleattending educational institutions (other than thoseattending universities or evening classes) and an employment service for people leaving them.Central Government financial assistance will begiven through the rate support grant arrangements and the Department will then cease to grant aidlocal authorities. At the same time the department will take over from local education authorities the responsibility for certain duties with regard tothe administration of unemployment benefit and supplementary allowances for young people under18. Expenditure by local education authorities willnot be affected by these changes as the cost of theincreased scope and coverage of the Service willbe offset by the savings on the administrative costof unemployment benefit and other work trans-ferred to the Department.51. Certain of the Departments schemes fortraining, transference and rehabilitation should be eligible for assistance from the European SocialFund from 1973, but such receipts are taken intoaccount in the net contributions to e.c. (Table 4).Redundancy Fund payments52. To take account of the decrease in the numbersreceiving redundancy payments, the present provision is considerably lower than that in Cmnd. 5178.A^^part of the general inducement scheme and it isdoubtful whether they are of any real value in termsof the total stock of skilled manpower available inthe country or significantly affect the decisions of firms about expansion in Assisted Areas. Most ofthe jobs which attract grant are unskilled or semi-skilled or are ones requiring specialised training foralready skilled workers. The Department has no control over the quantity or quality of training.43. Ministers have agreed in principle that theCommunity Industry scheme, which employspreviously unemployed young people in tasks of social value, should be continued to 1974-75 at least.The Department now forecast that it will bepossible to employ 2,000 people in that year ratherthan the 3,000 previously proposed. Subject to a review of the scheme, they propose that it shouldbe increased after 1974-75 to 3,000 employees and,if allowance were made for savings on supple-mentary benefit, the net cost which they would need to find would be about three-quarters of the grosscost shown in the table above.44. Ministers have also agreed in principle that toencourage the mobility of labour there should be some additional expenditure, of about  1 -1 million a year, mainly in support of the expenses of peoplelooking for jobs away from their homes.45. Apart from the above policy changes most ofthe balance for the Departments additional bidsarises from estimating changes which the Treasuryconsider they should accommodate by offsetting savings. In 1977-78, however, the Departmentpropose provision of  44-4 million on theadministrative expenses of the Industrial TrainingBoards and on key training grants. The Treasurypoint out that present policy at 1973 Survey price is that this expenditure should be up to  38-9million a year.46. The Governments policy on employment andtraining is explained in Cmnd. 5250 &quot; employment and Training: Government Proposals &quot;. provision is made for the cost of running the new ManpowerServices Commission which will be responsible for operating the employment and training servicesthrough the Employment Service and TrainingServices Agencies which have both been set up. TheEmployment Service Agency has made considerable progress in developing its structure and its pro-gramming and budgeting systems. It has alsolaunched a programme for providing job centres inimproved premises at a cost rising from  2 - 5 million in 1974-75 to  4-9 million in 1977-78. the professional and Executive Recruitment placingservice has made a promising start but only begancharging fees for its services in June 1973 becauseof current price restrictions. The forecasts take account of this.47. The improvements in the EmploymentTransfer Scheme referred to in Cmnd. 5178 have
In 1972-73 about 262,000 people received paymentscompared with 388,000 in 1971-72. The Schemeis at present the subject of a PAR.Regional Employment Premium53. The Regional Employment Premium, which is paid in respect of manufacturing establishments inthe development areas, will be phased out from september 1974 and there is provision for residualclaims in the second half of 1974-75 and in 1975-76.Ministers will decide later this year on the manner and riming of the phasing out and in the light ofthat decision further provision will be necessary.Refinancing of Export Credits54. There have been no changes in the arrange-ments described in Cmnd. 5178 for the refinancingby the Export Credits Guarantee Department of advances made by the clearing banks in respectof exports financed on credit of two years and over.55. The totals for 1975-76 and 1976-77 are nowsome  40 million and  65 million respectively lessthan was anticipated in Cmnd. 5178. these reductions are mainly due to revised forecasts ofthe overall volume of export finance outstanding inthose years. The amount of the refinancingpayments due to the clearing banks in 1972-73was lower than expected and accordingly  70million of the refinancing commitment assumed bythe Issue Department of the Bank of England priorto March 1972 was taken over by the export credits Guarantee Department in 1972-73. The1973-74 to 1975-76 figures for the remainder ofthe phased take-over in those years have beenreduced accordingly. The amount still due to betaken over from the Bank of England was approximately  300 million at 1st April 1973.56. The aim of the refinancing arrangements is, as stated in Cmnd. 5178, to ensure the continuingavailability of finance for exports produced in themain by the heavy7 capital goods industries,engineering, etc., where the contracts involve heavy-cash outlays and lengthy periods of manufacture and payment. Such continuing availability of financecannot be quantified in terms of a specific pro-gramme of needs. The willingness of the clearing banks to make advances to exporters depends, insome measure, on the extent of the banks&apos; owncommitments and resources at any given time. Thenew arrangements agreed in March 1972 wereframed in the light of this situation so that theactual amount of refinancing undertaken by theExport Credits Guarantee Department in anyparticular year follows the total demand for financeby exporters and takes account of the total of current account deposits held by the clearing banks inthat year.57. Some measure of the extent to which expendi-ture on refinancing will achieve the aim of the march 1972 arrangements can be assessed by comparing the yearly provision by the Export credits guarantee Department for refinancing with theyearly increase in the total volume of net fixed ratefinance outstanding:  million	Increase in net	Increase in	fixed rate export	amount refinanced	finance outstanding	by ECGD1972-73 .	290	2301973-74 .	335	2501974-75 .	386	3011975-76 .	238	1671976-77 .	250	1651977-78 .	232	14358. The figures given in the above paragraph are necessarily tentative. They show that, on presentassumptions, the Export Credits Guarantee Depart-ment will refinance between 65 and 80 per cent of theyearly increase in the total volume of fixed ratefinance outstanding. This then is the measurementof the refinancing which will be required to achieve the aim of the March 1972 arrangements.Miscellaneous services59. This item includes most of the expenditure ofthe Development Commission and the expenditureof the Highlands and Islands Development Board; agrant to the South of Scotland Electricity Board forstocking ancillary materials in excess of commerciairequirements; and also the grants to the scottish and Wales Tourist Boards, including their expenditure in Scotland and Wales on the hole!loans and grant scheme and the scheme of assistanceto tourist projects in development areas.Maplin Development Authority60. The Maplin Development Bill which providesfor the setting up of the Authority is at presenibefore Parliament Table 7 includes tentativeestimates of the cost of the land reclamation whichwill be undertaken by the Authority during the forecast period: the estimates are based on theassumption that the airport will open in 1980.Compared with Cmnd. 5178 revalued, the newfigures show a total reduction of some  4 miliioaover the first four years of the present Survey. Mostof the land reclaimed by the Authority will betransferred to other public authorities, in particulHthe British Airports Authority and the Port 0!London Authority, and the rest will be availableeventually for development in accordance with theGovernments industrial, regional and environmentpolicies. No allowance is made in the table fc&apos;payments by other public authorities for reclaimedland nor the off-setting receipts by the Authority:these transactions will have no net effect on thetotal of public expenditure.
MODIFIED INTERPRETATION OF EXISTINGPOLICIESSelective regional assistance61. Expenditure under Section 7 of the industry act will reflect industry&apos;s response to the forms ofassistance that have been offered, and can only be varied by altering the criteria. There are threeways in which this could be done: by varying theconcessionary interest rate, by varying the maximumpublic sector contribution to individual schemes, orby varying the boundaries or qualifications foreligibility of the assisted areas.62. The present criteria for Section 7 assistancehave only very recently been drawn up and announced, and any alteration at this stage aimed at reducing expenditure would be widely criticised as inconsistent with the Governmenfs declared policy of providing a stable set of incentives for regional regeneration. The loss of confidenceinvolved would have an impact wider than the directloss of financial assistance, and could call inquestion the credibility of the Governmenfs regional policy as a whole.63. It should be possible to achieve savings of 10 million a year by the end of the Survey period by increasing the concessionary interest rate by,say, 1 per cent representing a third of the differencebetween the concessionary and normal commercialrates. A reduction of 15 per cent would benecessary in the maximum public sector contributionto schemes to achieve a similar saving. TheDepartment of Trade and Industry consider thatthis would involve a change in policy and that thesepotential savings should come under the heading&quot; Alternative Policy Implications &quot;.General   assistance   to   industry Section   8   ofIndustry Act64. As mentioned in paragraph 6 above, the forecasts include provision only for approvedprojects and for certain projects still underconsideration which are expected to be approved.Any further expenditure under Section 8 of theIndustry Act would be a claim on the contingency reserve, and it has been agreed that a figure of 250 million over the Survey period should betaken as an &quot; indicative planning target&quot;; althoughit has always been understood that this did not mean that the sum would necessarily be spent.65. There would be a possible option to reduce the potential claim on the contingency reserve by adopting a stricter approach in considering proposalshere, combined with a lower planning target. the savings cannot, however, be precisely estimatedbecause there is no firm estimate of what expenditure will be without a stricter approach of this kind.However, a decision to extend to later years the limit of  35 million now agreed for 1974-75 would havethe effect of cutting  15 million a year from theamount which has provisionally been earmarkedagainst the contingency reserve for this item. In theDepartments view, this would curtail the Govern-menfs capacity to carry out its declared policy ofintervening to strengthen and modernise key sectors of British industry. They consider that schemes which on their merits would have qualified for support would have to be rejected; and this in turnwould have an adverse, though unquantifiable, effecton the efficiency of those sectors of industry that were involved.Civil aviation services capital expenditure by theCAA  million	1973	1974	1975	1976	1977	-74	-75	-76	-77	-781973 Survey	.   15-3	13-4	13-4	14-2	130Modified costing	.   15-2	12-6	12-3	11-3	9-2Saving	.    0-1	08	1-1	2-9	3-866. Most of the CAA&apos;s expenditure in 1973-74 and1974-75 is already firmly committed and the reduc-tions offered here (a total of  8-7 million) relatemainly to the removal of projects scheduled for thelast three years of the Survey and consist entirely of capital expenditure.  2 - 6 million would be savedif the opening of Maplin were delayed until 1983:the other savings would retard modernisationprogrammes designed, inter alia, to produce savings in both staff and maintenance costs.Aircraft, etc. general R&amp;D programme  million	1973	1974	1975	1976	1977	-74	-75	-76	-77	-781973 Survey	.   17-5	18-5	190	190	190Modified costing	.   17-5	18-0	180	180	180Saving	- :---	0-5	10	10	1067. In the Treasury&apos;s view an alternative, feasibleinterpretation designed to produce a lower level ofexpenditure may be achieved by a general shading-down of expenditure over the whole field, as above;and that this need not involve policy changes. How-ever, DTI consider that even these small reductionsmight involve the risk that industry may not be ableto participate across the board in future civilsubsonic projects.Other   research    and    development extramuralR&amp;D68. A severe rationing of the budgets of theRequirements Boards set up as a result of Cmnd.5046, and a restriction of the work by NERC to thelevel of the 1976-77 provision of Cmnd. 5178revalued, would provide the following savings:

Similar considerations apply here as in the caseof Section 7 assistance. Changes can be effected byvarying either the rate of grant or the size of theareas qualifying. Either would involve a majorrevision of Government policy towards regional development. The consequences would include aserious effect on the credibility of the policy and on industrial confidence generally, particularly as therehas been much criticism of the frequent changes ofrates by Government in the past.70. A reduction of 2 per cent in the rate of grant(f.e. from 22/20 per cent to 20/18 per cent) would lead to an eventual saving of about  20 million a year during the last three years of the survey period. In earlier years the savings would be substantially less, partly because expenditure onRDGs will still be building up and partly because itwould take some 18 months from the announcementbefore payments committed at the old rate wouldhave ceased.Minor industrial sponsorship71. The DTI view is that the figures adopted as a normal interpretation of existing policies are so lowthat no lower figures are possible without consider-able modification of policy. With such policy changes, however, the following savings could beachieved:  million	1973 -74	1974 -75	1975 -76	1976 -77	1977 -781973 Survey Alternative costing	6-2* 6-0	6-5 6-0	6-8 6-0	6-9 60	7-0 6-0Saving	0-2	0-5	0-8	0-9	1-0* Excluding  4-3 million in respect of the programme foraccelerated public sector purchases of machine tools.Aircraft, etc. general R&amp;D programme72. The Treasury consider that in addition to the savings due to the modified interpretation of existing policies in paragraph 67 above a further cut of 1 million a year from 1974-75 onwards should bepossible without major detriment to the programme.The DTI consider that these more substantial savings would mean withdrawal from one or moreareas of research activity, allowing developmentcapability to lapse in those areas.Space73. If no joint European space programme is agreed there is a policy option to discontinue thenational space technology programme. On theassumption that no new commitments are enteredinto beyond those already authorised, and that work at MOD(PE) establishments is wound up by31 March 1974, the savings on the 1973 Surveyfigures would amount to about  39 million over theperiod. In addition there would be no; potentialcall on the contingency reserve.Nuclear energy and other nuclear expenditure  million	1973	1974	1975	1976	1977	-74	-75	-76	-77	-781973 Survey	61-8	43-6	29-3	29-9	18-3Alternative costing	58-6	39-4	26-1	26-6	15-1Saving	3-2	4-2	3-2	3-3	3-274. The 1973 Survey estimate assumes the cancellation of work on either the steam generatingheavy water reactor (SGHWR) or the hightemperature reactor (HTR) to achieve the cutsassociated with the Chancellor of the Exchequersstatement of 21 May 1973. The alternative costingrepresents the further savings which would beachieved by cancellation of further work on theremaining of the two systems, and from a decision toundertake no further long term research on systemsbeyond the sodium-cooled fast reactor. The figures are illustrative only since no consultation has takenplace with the sea. The savings from cancellation of work on any particular reactor system are considerably less than the total expenditure involvedin continuing development, partly because of substantial run-down costs (particularly redundancy payments) and partly because continuing pro-grammes would have to carry a larger share ofoverheads of the R&amp;D establishments (whether itwould be possible to close one of the establishmentscould be determined only after careful examination).Selection of this variant would further limitMinisters&apos; options on the choice of thermal reactorsfor future installation and would leave only onereactor of United Kingdom design (the AGR) in the running.75. Further savings amounting to  1 or  2 million a year might be possible if the sea&apos;s programmeof underlying research in support of reactor develop-ment were drastically reduced. But it would benecessary to examine carefully with the sea whatscope there might be for savings in this area without
mprejudicing the basic support to reactor R&amp;D.A separate exercise would be needed in order to assess the implications of such a choice.Other research and development Extramural R&amp;D76. A very restrictive regime for the RequirementsBoards, particularly that for ship and marinetechnology; a reversal of current policy to increaseeffort in the fields of marine technology and offshoreoil; and a restriction of work by NERC to the 1975-76 level in Cmnd. 5178 revalued would providesavings additional to those in paragraph 68 above,as follows:  million	1973	1974	1975	1976	1977	-74	-75	-76	-77	-78Saving	9H995!

Savings on training grants would be achieved by restricting new expenditure by the ManpowerServices Commission to Cmnd. 5178 figuresunrevalued. The Department point out that industrial Training Boards have already expressed doubts about the adequacy of these grants; thata restriction to 1972 cash figures would reinforcethese doubts and disturb the relationship betweenthe Training Services Agency and the ITB&apos;s in thecradal initial stage of development; and that theview of the Agency is that it would be completely&apos;impracticable to run the scheme on the basis of us 1972 cash figures. The Treasury consider thatthe savings would not be inconsistent with publicly announced policy that this expenditure will rise&quot;up to  35 million in a full year&quot; and that thescheme has not yet taken on sufficiently firm shapefor such savings to be regarded as impracticable.&apos;9. Savings on the premises of the employment service Agency could be achieved by reducing theiaprovement programme by a quarter so postrxminghs completion from 1979-80 to 1981-82. TheBepamnent point out that the provision of properly9ied modem offices is a fundamental necessity forthe proper development of the service.CONTTDENTL4L80. Staff savings could be made by the defermentfrom 1974-75 to 1976-77 of the introduction of the&quot;breach of contract&quot; provision of Section 113 ofthe Industrial Relations Act; and by the defermentfrom 1974-75 to 1975-76 of the reduction to 26weeks of the qualifying period in unfair dismissalcases under the Industrial Relations Act TheDepartment observe that such action is likely tohave political implications. These staff savingsmay be subsumed as part of the exercise to reduceCivil Service numbers (see paragraph 39).Refinancing of Export Credits81. If the level of the present 6 per cent fixed rateof interest charged by the clearing banks for finance for exports of two years and over guaranteed bythe Export Credits Guarantee Department were raised in 1973 by \ per cent, the full effect of savings on refinancing would not occur until1977-78.

The present 6 per cent rate of interest hasbeen in existence since March 1972 when it was reduced to that level from f54 per cent. The level is determined by the Government and is altered only with Ministerial approval after assessment of thefull economic implications (including the effect on united Kingdom exports). It is impossible to judgewith any confidence the effect on exports of an alteration in the interest rate since it depends ona number of imponderables, e.g. the relative levelof international and domestic interest rates, and the underlying competitiveness of, and elasticity of demand for, United Kingdom exports.Maplm Development Authority  million	1973	1974	1975	1976	7977	-74	-75	-76	-77	-781973 Survey	1-0	15-0	19-0	17-0	15-0Ahensative costing	1-0	14-0	17-0	15-0	13-0Saving		1-0	2-0	2-0	2-083.

Chancellor of the Exchequer on 21st May, coupled with the fact that the initial forecasts were alreadylower than in Cmnd. 5178 revalued, suggests thatthe shortfall should not be too big. In thecircumstances we have retained last year&apos;s provisionof a shortfall allowance of  100 million for eachyear of the Survey period.Comparison with Cmnd. 5178 revalued5. Over the four years 1973-74 to 1976-77 the forecasts of capital expenditure by the industries have been reduced from the amounts shown in cmnd. 5178, revalued to 1973 Survey prices, by amounts of between  70 million and  265 million a year. This has been caused by a decrease in theestimate of the demand for energy over the quinquennium and beyond; a reduction in the rateof progress which will be made in the modernisation of the steel industry; a slight reduction in the fore-cast rate of procurement of aircraft by the british airways Board; and the reductions announced bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer on 21st May.Financial performance and counter inflation policy. During the last two years the nationalised industries have been subject to counter inflationarypolicies, firstly by matching the CBI initiative on price restraint and then under stages I and II of theGovernments counter inflation programme. for most major industries the effect has been theabandonment of financial objectives; a reduction inthe level of self-financing; and calls for compensation (which have been agreed finally or inprinciple for a number of industries for the year1972-73). Proposals are now with Ministers for asystem of short-term financial objectives, and for compensation, for 1973-74. A special table showingcapital expenditure and sources of funds of theindustries is included this year for the first time ina special analysis to the Report. It shows for theyears 1972-73, 1973-74 and 1974-75 the total capital programme, and the sources of fundsincluding balance of revenue after interest and depreciation, other capital receipts and compensa-tion. The analysis therefore brings out the relativeburden of the capital expenditure on these programmes on the taxpayer and the consumer.CONFIDENTIAL 27Investment by the nationalised industries. The capital expenditure programmes of the nationalised industries account for about 6  percent of all public expenditure. The programmes are normally planned so that the industries can meetthe demands of their customers for products and services, for which they pay, in the most efficientway. However, in 1971 the industries were requested to advance expenditure on. certaininvestment projects in 1972-73 and 1973-74 inorder to assist the employment position.2. Nationalised industries&apos; capital expenditure isnow expected to show a gradual increase over thefive-year period from  1,937 million in 1973-74 to 2,350 million in 1977-78. Expenditure on fixed assets is likewise expected to increase from  1,914million in 1973-74 to  2,350 million in 1977-78.The figures in the tables reflect the reductions innationalised industry capital expenditure totalling 140 million in 1974-75 announced by theChancellor of the Exchequer on 21st May. Theirprecise allocation is still tentative pending further discussion with the Boards. Some  20 million ofthis is to be found from disposal of land and fixed assets, and is now more likely to accrue in 1973-74.3. For capital expenditure other than fixed investment the provisional outturn for 1972-73 andthe estimates for 1973-74 and 1974-75 are  145million,  102 million and  67 million respectively.These amounts are higher than usual and providefor the build up of stocks partly. to restore theposition following the run down due to the miners&apos;strike early in 1972 and partly to increase the size of the holdings of stocks needed as the economyexpands.4. In 1971-72 expenditure on fixed assets after allowing for substantial shortfall was about  200million lower than forecast. The provisional out-turn for 1972-73 shows an underspend of about 28 million again after allowance had been madefor a substantial shortfall on the total of theindustries&apos; own estimates. This underspending,although showing a downward trend suggests the continuing need for some allowance this year: butthe reductions in expenditure announced by the

The National Coal Board&apos;s (NCB) activitiescomprise mining (collieries and opencast),ancillaries (eg coke ovens), trade undertakings andparticipation in off-shore prospecting for hydro-carbons.2. In July 1972, Ministers decided that the board should aim at the intermediate of three possiblerates of contraction (though they did not preclude aswitch to a lower rate if this seemed desirable).This course involves a reduction in manpower of26 per cent over the three years 1973-74 to 1975-76.On current estimates, a reduction of this order would bring about a decline in output of around 20per cent by 1977-78 see table below though this is inevitably subject to much uncertainty.million tonsActual Estimates1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977-72    -73       -74    -75    -76    -77    -78Output . 120* 141 136 128 121 119 ,116* Distorted by National Strike.3. The NCB&apos;s proposed figures for mininginvestment postulate a lower manpower rundown,23 per cent, in the years up to 1975-76. In orderto ensure consistency with the intermediate courseapproved by Ministers, Departments have agreedto reduce the NCB&apos;s proposals for mining investment by  6 million over the five years 1973-74 to 1977-78. The exclusion of an additional  31 million hasbeen agreed because it related to the sinking ofnew mines and other projects, the case for whichhas not yet been fully assessed. Some of thisinvestment may prove to be desirable when it is fully appraised.4. The investment levels sponsored by DTIinvolve a decline of about 20 per cent in annual expenditure on mining between 1973-74 and 1977-78 ie about the same as the expected decline in output over this period, but the figures in Table 8contain further reductions of  5 million in 1974-75,  7 million in 1975-76 and  8 million in each ofthe following two years to reflect the Treasury viewthat the forecast decline in output should be accompanied by a faster decline in investment.The DTI disagree with these reductions, which theyclaim would be counter-productive, in that theywould affect productivity, thereby frustrating theBoard&apos;s efforts to follow the intermediate course, or else increase the level of support they need to keepto this course. Ministers&apos; current review of energypolicy may also lead to a need for higher investment in coal.5. The amounts included for mining for 1973-74to 1976-77 are in total  10 million lower than thecorresponding levels in Cmnd. 5178 revalued, but
pending decisions on coal support those levels werebasically the same as those contained in the 1971Survey.6. The figures for investment in non-miningactivities (which will only exceptionally be financed from the National Loans Fund) include the total capital expenditure envisaged, except that in tradeundertakings, which remains at a token  1 million ayear. Investment in ancillaries in 1973-74 to 1976-77 (excluding off-shore exploration) is in total  5 million lower than the revalued figures in Cmnd.5178 because of a drop in the estimated demand forcoke and manufactured solid fuels. Expenditure foroff-shore exploration and the development of established fields has been phased back, owing todelays in the development work itself and in negotiating sales with the Gas Corporation. Thefigures show reductions of  4 million in 1973-74, 7 million in 1974-75 and  2 million in 1975-76, andan increase of  9 million in 1976-77. They make no allowance for the discovery of new oil or gasfields by the NCB and their partners or the awardto them of further licences.7. Support for the industry, under the Coal Acts,to attain the policy described in paragraph 2 above is included in the section on Trade, industry andemployment.Electricity Council and Boards (England and Wales)8. Investment in electricity supply is primarilydetermined by the forecast growth of simultaneousmaximum demand (SMD) and the level of unitsales expected, which in turn depend uponexpectations of (economic gpowth. The annualinvestment of the industry has fallen steadily froma high point of  665 million at outturn prices in1966-67 to the present rate of about  450 million as the load forecast has been reduced each year over the last decade. The 1973 forecast of theElectricity Council is lower than the 1972 forecastunderlying Cmnd. 5178 as indicated below-Cmnd. 5178 March 1973 forecastYear	Units	SMD	Units	SMD	required		required		(Million	(MW.)

This difference arisespartly as a result of the Electricity Councils taking a less confident view of economic growth than theGovernment. However, the projected expenditure inTable 8 runs at a level above that in Cmnd. 5178revalued, because the CEGB proposed on 6th April1973 to provide for a substantially increased propor-tion of new generating capacity to be met by nuclearstations with consequent increased capital costs.This increased nuclear cost more than offsets reduc-tions in the number of station orders required tomeet the reduced load forecast.9.  Expenditure on generation, accounting for about two-thirds of the whole programme, depends uponthe forecast for SMD for six years ahead of theexpenditure year, i.e. for the winter when capacitystarted in any one year can be brought into service.A planning margin of capacity over the forecast isnecessary to allow for variations between actualdemand and forecast, for plant breakdown, and foradverse weather, and a separate allowance is madefor delays in the planned completion of plant.  Thefigures in Table 8, as in Cmnd. 5178, are based onthe planning margin of 20 per cent adopted by theElectricity Council in 1971.  Ministers have still toconsider whether this planning margin should be endorsed but the Department of Trade and Industryconsiders that the uncertainties about the demandforecast, future plant availability and constructiondelay make a 20 per cent margin barely adequate at best if the present risk of power cuts is not toincrease.  A further important consideration is thesituation of the heavy electrical plant manufacturing industry which has suffered from the low rate ofordering over the past few years.   The generatingBoards have a commercial interest in smoothingplant ordering to maintain a steady flow of work tothe  manufacturers  thereby  reducing  costs  andsustaining the capacity needed to meet demand inthe longer term, while the Government is also con-cerned with the consequences for employment and export capability.  The estimates therefore maintainthe provision included in Cmnd. 5178 for a majorstation order in 1973, and the Central electricity generating Board (CEGB) is  seeking approvalaccordingly to order a 2,000-MW. oil-fired station atLittlebrook, Kent, as soon as possible.- Ministers areexpected to consider this proposed order, its implications-tions for fuel policy and the planning margin issue in July.10- The estimates in Table 8 also provide forfurther orders in 1974 and after on the scaleexpected to be needed to meet likely demand in years beyond 1977-78 on the basis of the 1973 loadforecast. They assume that there will be orders forone oil-fired station in addition to that referred to inparagraph 9 and one pumped storage station beforethe end of 1974 and otherwise only nuclear stationswill be ordered. For illustrative purposes, theestimates for nuclear stations have been based onadvanced gas-cooled reactor costs, but this does not
imply any decision on reactor type and the actualcosts; of a nuclear programme will depend upon thedecision on reactor type.11. Provision is included in Table 8 for a substan-tial programme of conversion of existing power stations (totalling 5,000-MW. capacity) to burn oil ornatural gas instead of coal. The planned conversionexpenditure totals about  55 million over the wholeprogramme of which the greater part falls into theperiod from 1975-76 to 1977-78. This expenditure is designed to reduce system costs and improvesystem flexibility between fuels and will depend uponMinisters&apos; decisions on energy policy as well as the outcome of the Gas Corporation^ negotiations toacquire more natural gas for the United Kingdom.12. The programmes of the Area Electricity boards have not yet been finally assessed by DTI, but theyare more dependent upon forecasts of demand andeconomic activity in the next two or three years.There is a reduction in all years in this component of the estimates compared with Cmnd, 5178 revalued,reflecting the reduction in short-term load forecastsand the consequent deferment of some systemreinforcement and of some provision for connectionsof new domestic and industrial loads.13. The estimate of  484 million in 1974-75 incor-porates a reduction of  32 million below the figureproposed by the industry as the expected contributionto the package of public expenditure reductionsannounced on 21st May by the Chancellor of theExchequer. The Electricity Council advise that suchcuts will undoubtedly invoke increased risk to security of supplies, particularly in distribution asfrom 1975-76. This is not entirely compatible withthe announced objective of maintaining investmentessential to sustain economic growth and the reduc-tion shown is subject to confirmation by DTIMinisters.14. The industry&apos;s decision to base its estimates onthe assumption of an all-nuclear programme forstation orders after 1975 represents a radical change from the basis used in previous estimates, andreflects the recent changes of view about future fuelavailability, particularly oil. After discussions between the Minister for Industry and the electricity council the DTI have concluded that the mostprudent course is to accept this increased financial provision so as to be able to implement the policyof exploiting nuclear energy as rapidly as possible.Meanwhile the Treasury has considerable reserva-tions as to the extent to which the CEGB component of the programme embodied in Table 8 is likely to prove acceptable or realistic in the event.Scottish Electricity Boards15. Although they are separate statutory bodies theNorth of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board (NSHEB)and the South of Scotland Electricity Board (SSEB)plan and operate their generating system as one. in considering the pattern of overall investment it istherefore necessary to view the programmes together.16. The main determinant of the generating capacity required for the Scottish system is the forecast maximum demand on the system. TheScottish Electricity Boards&apos; 1973 forecast of maximum demand on the mainland system in average weather conditions is:Megawatts (MW.)1972	1973	1974	1975	1976	1977	1978	1979-73	-74	-75	-76	-77	-78	-79	-805,491*	6,263	6,703	7,208	7,663	8,158	8,688	9,248* Actual Winter maximum demand not adjusted to averageweather conditions.These forecasts, which show a reduction of nearly500 MW. on the 1972 forecasts for 1979H-80, havebeen discussed with the Boards and are consideredacceptable for planning purposes.17. The estimates published in Cmnd. 5178 took account of the decision that the NSHEB should build a 1,260-MW. oil/gas-fired generating station atPeterhead instead of the proposed nuclear station at stake Ness. The first 630-MW. generating set atPeterhead was approved for commissioning in 1978but no final decision was taken on the timing of thesecond set. As a decision was needed before con-tracts for the station were placed in June 1973, thequestion was referred to Ministers for separate consideration. In the context of the Chancellorsstatement on public expenditure on 21st May,Ministers agreed that the second set at Peterheadshould be commissioned in 1979 but that theprovision for the conversion of two SSEB coal-firedpower stations to oil or gas firing should be deferredto allow a reduction of  3 -1 million in expenditure in1974-75. The figures in Table 8 reflect this decision.18. With the ordering of Peterhead no furtherstations will require approval this year. To take account of the reductions in forecast demand the boards have deferred the investment provision forthe additional capacity which will be required after1980. Otherwise apart from the deferment of power station conversions referred to in paragraph17 above, the programmes of the Boards arebasically the same as those in Cmnd. 5178.British Gas Corporation19., Planning by the British Gas Corporation(BGC), formerly the Gas Council and Area Boards,has been dominated by the need to secure additional supplies, which has been accentuated by recentdownward revision of the total quantity of reservesunder contract. This revision has necessarilyinvalidated some of the Corporation^ planningassumptions. The BGC is at present negotiating topurchase gas from the Frigg field which lies partly in the United Kingdom sector and partly in the
Norwegian sector of the North Sea. If successfulit expects to absorb in total about 5,000 million cubic feet a day (mcfd) in 1977-78. On the basis ofexisting reserves alone the comparable figure wouldbe below 4,000 mcfd; this would imply a significantcontraction of the present level of sales to industry.20. The programme of expenditure on fixed assets,before provision for absorbing further natural gassupplies, shows substantial reductions throughoutthe period on the corresponding figures in Cmnd.5178 revalued. This reflects both lower plannedinvestment and a new adjustment designed to eliminate the previous tendency towards over-estimating.21. The figures contained in Cmnd. 5178 includedan allowance of  25 million in each year from 1973-74 in recognition of the industry&apos;s need for additional expenditure on further supplies of gas.For the purposes of the current Survey, departments have agreed that the figures should include theestimated cost of absorbing and marketing Frigggas as indicative of the likely expenditure on additional natural gas supplies. The table illustrates the estimated expenditure on Frigg included in thefigures in table 8:  million	1973	1974	1975	1976	1977	-74	-75	-76	-77	-78Estimated expenditure					on Frigg gas .	8-0	41-0	40-0	26-0	25-0The figures in Table 8 also include the effects of the cuts in expenditure announced in the Chancellorsstatement on public expenditure on 21st May.BGC have deferred expenditure of  10-5 million from 1974-75 into the succeeding two years bypostponing office, showroom and computer projects and by deferring renewals of non-urgent distributionequipment. Compared with Cmnd. 5178 revalued,total expenditure on fixed assets is lower in 1973-74by  47 million and in 1974-75 by  30 million, withincreases of  5 million in 1975-76 and 1976-77.22. A possibility of BGC equity participation perhaps  100 million-in the pipeline and shoreterminal associated with Frigg has been raised in negotiations. This would be financed by, foreignborrowing but is at present too contingent for inclusion in the Survey.23; WiUiout additional supplies the BGC will notbe able from the end of 1972-73 onwards to meetnon-tariff (mainly industrial) demand. Up-tOrdateestimates of the level of sales they will achieve inthis sector are not yet available. Forecast tariff(mainly domestic and commercial) demand, whichthe industry can and will meet, is as follows:million thermsActual		Estimates		1971    1972	1973	1974    1975	1976	1977-72     -73	-74	-75     -76	-77	-785,200   5,600	6,100	6,600   7,200	7,600	8,00024. The cost of converting appliances to burnnatural gas (about  220 million at outturn prices inthe review period) is not included in Table 8 but is reflected in the industry&apos;s gross trading surpluses.The conversion programme is scheduled for completion by the end of 1976.ALTERNATIVE POLICY IMPLICATIONS25. The following paragraphs deploy a number of&quot; costed variants&quot;. In considering them, twogeneral points should be borne in mind.(i) Energy (and steel-see paragraph 3 of Section9) are basic inputs to productive industry.It would be of questionable wisdom toimpose cuts which would damage thecountry&apos;s productive capacity simply becausethese industries happen to be nationalised.Increased imports of steel and oil would benecessary to sustain growth.(ii) Energy prospects are uncertain. The greatestuncertainty centres on future prices for oil.Greater dependence on oil imports wouldinvolve reduced security of supply and strain on the balance of payments. The alternative of increased dependence on nuclear powergeneration would increase capital investment in electricity.National Coal Board  million	1973	7974	7975	1976	1977	-74	-75	-76	-77	-78Investment in fixed assets					Cmnd. 5178 revalued	97	102	86	73	1973 Survey  .	96	90	81	72	64Alternative costing .	96	90	81	72	57Saving					7Assistance to the coal industry					Cmnd. 5178 revalued	155	150	135		1973 Survey  .      .     &apos;.	155	150	135	70	soAlternative costing .			131	, 55	26Saving      .			4	15	2426. The above option entails a reduction of 10 percent in the NCB&apos;s forecast output in 1977-78.Investment in 1977-78 would be reduced by 7 million, and the NCB&apos;s revenue deficit would fallby  24 million, thereby saving an equivalent Assuming Government assistance to the coal industry.. A
reduction in output of this order would require a fall in manpower of 102,000 over the period (39 percent of the current labour force), compared with75,000 on the normal Survey programme. the closure of an additional 23 pits would also benecessary. Faster contraction of the industry,bearing most heavily on the assisted areas, wouldresult in additional expenditure on social security benefits, redundancy pay, etc., which could offsetmuch of the savings while the deterioration in labour relations that would probably result fromfaster contraction could increase the Board&apos;s costs.Reduced output could also lead to a shortage of energy, requiring a higher level of coal or oil imports and reducing security of supply.Electricity  Council  and  Boards  (England  andWales) -  million	1973	1974	1975	1976	1977	-74	-75	-76	-77	-78Cmnd. 5178 revalued .	.    488	518	542	615	1973 Survey     .	.    472	484	555	648	739Alternative costing			540	610	680Saving			15	40	6027. Under this variant, which the DTI oppose, the cancellation of the thermal power station order in1974 would save some  60 million a year by 1977-78, but only at the cost of increasing the risk of power cuts and exacerbating the problems of theheavy electrical plant manufacturers. This could lead to increased unemployment in the plantmanufacturing industry (with increased unemploy-ment and social security.payments) and to increasedpressure for regional assistance. In addition, cuts in electricity investment must place at risk industrial productivity some years hence. Ministers are in anycase due to consider (in July 1973) the issues of planning margin (which raises the question of theacceptable level of risk of power cuts) and of theposition of the plant manufacturing industry.28. An alternative variant, which the DTI similarlyoppose, which would provide savings of the same order of magnitude would be to reduce to two thenumber of new nuclear power station orders inthe whole programme to 1977-78. This assumes that future fuel availability (either oil or coal)would make such a reduction possible. Inter-mediate assumptions of the nuclear content of thepower station building programme would yieldcorrespondingly reduced savings. The adoption ofthis course would also depend upon future policy decisions about nuclear strategy, which are due tobe announced by early 1974.29. On either option, large public expendituresavings would be possible without pre-empting the eventual decision on the case for a 1973 order or ministers&apos; future consideration of the planningmargin and the plant manufacturers&apos; needs.Although the normal Survey programme allows forthe most likely nuclear strategy in the present viewof the industry; decisions on individual stationorders, and the associated expenditure, will remain under the control of Ministers&apos; later decisions.30. However, the DTI do not consider that either of the two options in paragraphs 27 and 28 are acceptable. If a lower profile of expenditure isessential the DTI would instead propose for con-sideration a range of cuts spread over the whole industry. Such cuts would of course impair efficiency and increase operating costs (at rates of return on capital well above the test discount rate) whichwould be reflected in the revenue budget, prices andborrowing. Their cumulative effect together with the cuts already imposed for 1974-75 would most certainly jeopardise the security of supply moreparticularly on the distribution side and they represent only the scale of reductions possible whichwould be comparatively less harmful than theprevious options. The savings implied would amount to  25 million in 1975-76,  30 million in1976-77 and  30 million in 1977-78, producing totalsavings of  85 million in the three years.Scottish Electricity Boards  million1973 1974 1975 1976 1977-74    -75    -76    -77    -78South of Scotland ElectricityBoardCmnd. 5178 revalued1973 Survey  .Alternative costing .Saving    .      .North of Scotland Hydro-Electric BoardCmnd. 5178 revalued1973 Survey  .Alternative costing .Saving71-5   59-8   54-8   62-375-5  56-4 49-1   48-9 70-075-5  56-4 49-1   48-1 69-30-8 0-718-5  23-6  45-8   52-425-3  31-5  51-3   53-3 43-525-3   31-5   51-3   53-2 42-80-1 0-731. The majority of the Scottish electricity boards&apos;investment is already committed for up to six years ahead. A decision on the second set at Peterhead,which is in the basic figures, has been considered separately by Ministers in advance. Apart fromthat, the only remaining scope for reduction lies intransmission and distribution expenditure which is incurred only when this is necessary to maintain thesecurity of the system and to avoid the risk ofinterruption of supplies to industry and to com-mercial and domestic consumers. It has thus not proved practicable to seek to identify an alternativeprogramme path for the two boards. The costedvariant for the SSEB embodied in the above table
involves the postponement of a transmission schemewhich, though not essential, is commercially desirable and whose deferment would cause financial loss tothe Board. The figures shown for the NSHEBwhich relate to the postponement of transmission anddistribution schemes are not considered acceptableby the Scottish Economic Planning Departmentbecause of the very serious risk involved to supplies at a time when the requirements of the highly important industrial developments taking place in theNorth are particularly difficult to forecast and couldbe severely prejudiced-British Gas Corporation  million1973 1974-74     -751975 1976 1977-76     -77     -78Cmnd. 51/8 revalued1973 SurveyAlternative costingSaving190-8 190-4 163-7 141-0143-3 160-0 169-0 146-2 125-0135-3 119-0 129-0 120-2 100-08-0 41-0 40-0    26-0 25-032. The option embodied in the above figuresrepresents a decision that the BGC should not be permitted to purchase gas from a substantial sourcebeing developed in the North Sea; for the purpose ofillustration the cost of acquiring gas from the Friggfield has been used as being indicative of the scale of the expenditure involved. Frigg represents a secure source of energy supply available at a lowcapital cost: a total investment of  140 million buysan output equivalent to that from about eight2,000-MW. power stations. Its loss would result in about 5,000 million therms of unsatisfied industrialdemand in 1977-78 which would otherwise be metmainly by imported oil. If further North Sea gasreserves were not contracted the BGC would need toconsider plans for importing liquefied natural gas ormanufacturing substitute natural gas. Althoughduring the period of the Survey present indicationssuggest that the capital cost of either alternative would not exceed the capital cost of exploiting Frigg,in the longer term the capital savings from forgoingFrigg would be considerably offset by the necessaryalternative investment, which cannot yet bequantified.9.  steel table 9   million at 1973 Survey prices1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 1971-72 1972-73 ontfam outturn  outturn  outturn provisional outturn	1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-7&amp; estimate estimate estimate estimate estimateExpenditure oa fixed assets ia fee United Kingdom British Sted Corporation       .       83-0   105-0    173-0   257-0   204-0 Less: Sales of fixed asses .      .      -4-0    -4-0    -2-0   -16-0    -4-0	242-0    339-0    353-0    384-0    399-0 -22-0                                 Gross  domestic fixed  capital formation   ....       79-0    101-0    171-0   241-0    209-0 Other capital expsodnnre .      .       69-0     31-0    -3-0  -29-0     72-0	220-0    339-0    353-0    384-0    399-0 46-0     27-0       5-0     26-0     15-0Total capital exoesnrane     143-0   132-0    16S-0   212-0    172-0	266-0    366-0    358-0   410-0    414-0Changes from Cmnd. 5178 revaiBad: Estimating chaoses .      .      .                                                -78-0 C-i 5173 xevafaad    .      .      .                                                 350-0	-20-0  -18-0     -        --104-0  -27-0   -25-0    -2-0 390-0    411-0    383-0   432-0	1.

Net capital expenditure has been further reduced by 20 million, representing the amount of the agreedcut in investment by DTI nationalised industries which it was suggested might be found from the saleof assets. This amount is provisionally shownagainst BSC and in 1973-74 rather than 1974-75,since it is now thought more likely to accrue in thatyear. It is subject to later reallocation on the basisof further advice from DTI.2. The early part of the period will see the corn-missioning of developments at Scunthorpe, Llanwern,Teesside and Ravenscraig. By the end of the period the Corporation^ major expansion at Port Talbotand the first stage of the new complex at Teessidewill be under way, as will a new electric arc steel-making plant in Scotland supported by a directreduction pelletisation plant. Modernisation and expansion of capacity for stainless and alloy steels atSheffield should be well advanced. The proportionof basic oxygen steelmaking facilities is planned toincrease from less than 50 per cent to 76 per cent ofthe total. Continuous casting capacity will also beincreased and there will be substantial expenditureon modern ironmaking and rolling plant. Obsoletesteelmaking capacity of about 9 million tonnes willbe closed. These and other developments areexpected to bring the Corporation^ total productioncapability for liquid steel up from 27^ million tonnesin 1972-73 to over 31 million tonnes by 1977-78.During the period the Corporation expect to reducemanpower by about 12 per cent to just over 200,000by 1977-78.10.

The estimated reduction in expenditure is basedon deferments by one or two years of a variety of projects selected so as to cause the least overalldamage as seen at present to bsc&apos;s operations. Adifferent selection might be made nearer the time inthe light of trade and technical developments. Thedeferments would leave the main elements of the approved strategy for the expansion of steelmakingintact; total steelmaking capacity would not neces-sarily be affected, though this would be only at theexpense of retaining old and less efficient plant forlonger. Deferments of new rolling mill projectscould however affect capacity for particular finished products. The main effects of the deferments, how-ever, would be on bsc&apos;s production costs and on theimprovement of product quality. bsc&apos;s ability tosupply British industry with products at the quality and price required would be affected, they would bemore vulnerable to competition from imports, andtheir profits would suffer.

Thisdecrease is made up as follows:  millionTelecommunications   .      .      .   -63-1Posts ......   -24-9Giro and Remittance Services . -t- 0-5Data Processing Service      .      .   +13-6Telecommunications2. The Telecommunications investment programmeaccounts for over 94 per cent of the total PostOffice figures for the five years to 1977-78 and theamount estimated for 1977-78 is 2-4 per cent higherthan for 1972-73. The programme within theUnited Kingdom caters for major improvements inthe quality of the inland services such as the elimination of serious congestion in the trunk andlocal networks, the reduction of plant defects to aminimal level, and the completion of conversions ofmanual exchanges and STD coverage. Work isalso in hand to improve the quality of theinternational service over the period. Given a fairly sharp increase in rentals and connectioncharges in April 1974, the programme meets levels of demand which are in each year higher than thoseforecast last year but also gives rise to an expenditure which is on the whole lower than last year&apos;s even before account is taken of the  33*5 million cutforming part of the reduction in public expenditurein 1973-74 and 1974-75. These savings are achieved by economies in the design of exchanges and to a lesser extent by a reduction in the cost ofexchange equipment at constant prices. Before the cut in public expenditure it had been planned toreduce the waiting list to 40,000 by March 1975,but the estimated effect of the cut is that the waitinglist (now 200,000) may be about 100,000 and risingat that date. Some  27 million is included in theprogramme for equipment modernisation.Posts3. Expenditure on Posts has been substantiallycurtailed from the proposals embodied in Cmnd.5178, mainly by the refinement of estimatedaccommodation requirements and by a slower rateof letter mechanisation: a saving of  2-0 millionarises from the cut in public expenditure in 1973-74and 1974-75. Just over 70 per cent of the reducedprogramme will be devoted to the replacement of buildings that will have to be given up or whichare seriously deficient in space and to buildings toprovide service in new areas of population growth.Expenditure on postal plant (17 per cent of the total)will provide for the continuation of lettermechanisation but over an extended period and forthe completion of parcel mechanisation. almost all the remaining expenditure will be on the replacement of obsolescent vehicles and a smallexpansion of the transport fleet.CONFIDENTIALGiro and remittance services4. The Giro investment programme is small. Theonly significant change from last years Review for march 1973 prices is an increase of  0-4 million in1972-73 caused by late contractors claims relatingto the construction of the National Giro Centre atBootle. No capital expenditure is included forRemittance (money and postal order) Services.Data processing services. The Data Processing Service provides computerservices both for the various Post Office businessesand for other customers. In 1971 however, thePost Office decided that for the time being it would no longer engage in computer services for othercustomers apart from its existing commitments andutilisation of spare capacity. This policy remains unchanged. The increase in expenditure on fixed assets compared with Cmnd. 5178 is due to two newprojected schemes for the telecommunicationsbusiness and the probable need to bring forward the replacement of an out-of-date range of computers.ALTERNATIVE POLICY IMPLICATIONS  million1973 1974 1975 1976 1977-74     -75     -76     -77     -78Cmnd. 5178 revalued .   705-0  726-4  723-7  730-21973 Survey .   708-6  693-6  714-5  700-9  677-2Alternative costing    .   708-6  693-6  706-2  687-8  660-3Saving      .      .      -     -      8-3    13-1    16-96. The lower costed option for the telecommunications-tions business totalling  29-5 million assumes thatno further savings should be made in areas affectingthe size of the waiting list. Most of it representsexpenditure on a number of new facilities whichthe Post Office are planning to introduce, such asradio paging, key phones, proprietary telephones,alarms by carrier and facsimile, which are likely to prove highly profitable although the investment is relatively small. Some of these are part of the overall modernisation programme. Others areprojects which the Minister of Posts and telecommunications has been pressing the PostOffice to introduce as a result of pressure from the manufacturing industry and in the interest of theconsumer.7. The option for Posts totals  8-8 million andenvisages a deferment of the new Post OfficeHeadquarters building. The Post Office wouldhave to continue to occupy rented accommodation at substantially greater expense, go back on under-takings to the Staff Side and incur the ill-will of theCity Authorities because of non-development of the site. There would be cumulative adverse effectsfrom the remaining options, which relate to minorworks and furniture and fittings.35

The investment programme of the british airways Board (BAB), formerly BOAC and BEA,shows fairly substantial reductions from Cmnd.5178 revalued with the exception of two years,1973-74 and 1975-76. The increased expenditure in1973-74 is largely the result of bringing forward thepurchase of boac&apos;s 14th and 15th Boeing 747s:other factors are slightly greater progress payments for further B747s and TriStars. The reduction in later years reflect in the main the rephasing ofadditional B747 purchases and lower expenditureon other aircraft, mainly BAC Super 1-1 Is.Aircraft expenditure is again the major item ofexpenditure in 1977-78 with nearly  70 million outof a total of  97 million being allocated to B747sand TriStars.2. About 80 per cent of the BAB&apos;s capitalexpenditure is usually on the purchase of aircraft.The programme envisages a growth in the BAB&apos;sfleet over 5 years of 5 Concordes, 16 TriStars and16 Boeing 747s plus stage payments on a further10 747s (the net result is an increase of 3 747s overthe 1972 Investment programme).3. The anticipated effect these purchases are intended to have on the BAB&apos;s performance arereflected in the table below which envisages anaverage growth of 11 per cent a year in passengermiles over the next five years:	Passenger	Load ton	Revenue	miles	miles	1972-73     .      .	100	100	1001973-74     .	122	118	1181974-75     .	130	125	1281975-76     .	139	135	1451976-77	155	155	1651977-78     .	169	170	184Average annual per-			centage increase   .	+ 11	+ 11	+ 13(extracted from BAB Corporate Plan)4:&apos; It is expected that market shares will be held at current levels but increases are planned by BEA to expand its share of the inclusive tour market to andfrom the United Kingdom to 20 per cent by 1975and by BOAC to increase its share of the scheduledmarket between the United Kingdom and theUnited States of America from 28 per cent in 1971-72 to 35 per cent in 1977-78.British Airports authority. The estimate for capital expenditure by theBritish Airports Authority (BAA) in the five-year period is  109 million, to cater for the forecastgrowth in traffic at its existing airports, mainly at heathrow and Gatwick. This includes  10 million as the estimated cost of developments at Edinburghairport, for which planning permission in principlehas been given and for which a contribution will bemade by the Department of Trade and Industry.
The provision within this total for the first fouryears taken together does not exceed the aggregatefor those years in Cmnd. 5178 revalued.6. BAA will towards the end of the period begin the construction of terminal buildings and other facilities for the new Maplin airport ( 18 million in1976-77 and 1977-78 taken together). These costs are additional to the figures in the preceding para-graph and are based on the assumption that the target date for the opening of Maplin is 1980. .,7. An indication of the developments required atthe five existing BAA airports is provided byestimates of the growth in the number of terminalpassengers (that is, passengers whose air journeysbegin or end at the airport concerned) and aircraftmovements; the total annual figures for the fiveairports (Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Edinburgh,Prestwick) are:Terminal passengersMillion to nearest 0-51968-69     1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	1972-7316-5          18-5	21-0	23-0	25-0(BAA&apos;s forecasts)			(estimated)1973-74     1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-7827-5         30-5	33-5	37-0	40-5Aircraft movements			Thousands			1968-69     1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	1972-73*285           *310	*320	353	364(BAA&apos;s forecasts)			1973-74     1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78375           394	415	429	447&apos; Excluding Edinburgh.ALTERNATIVE POLICY IMPLICATIONSBritish Airways Board	1973	1974	1975	1976	1977	-74	-75	-76	-77	-78Cmnd. 5178 revalued	78-9	168-8	203-3	131-3	_1973 Survey      .	95-9	124-0	203-8	109-4	97-1Alternative costing&apos;&quot;	88-0	124-0	182-0	97-0	900Saving .	7-9	-	21-8	12-4	7-1* Treasury proposal not yet agreed by DTI.8. The operational implications of the lower costedoptjon are as follows. In the first year, the board might be unable to purchase any helicopters orBAC-llls at present leased. In the succeedingyears they would have to reduce the expenditure by the equivalent of the cost of 3 Boeing 747s(either by forgoing further 747 orders or bycancelling Lockheed 10-11s or Concordes).Depending upon the aircraft type chosen they couldsuffer a considerable loss of potential earnings andof profits and would be denied opportunities for expanding their services. Reckoning for BOACalone, and reckoning in terms of seat numbersrather than the number of aircraft, forgoing 3 747smight be taken as the equivalent of a reduction ofsome 10 per cent in their capacity.British Airports Authority&apos;3l1974--751975-761976-771977-781973 Survey (includingMaplin) . . . 20-5 23-0 23-5 24-0 36-0Alternative costing     .   20-5    23-0    23-5    23-0    34-0Saving .10     2-09. The lower costed option involves reductions in expenditure exclusively at existing BAA airportsand not at Maplin (which in 1977-78 accounts for nearly half the expected capital expenditure). Ithas not been possible to relate a reduction inforecast expenditure at the existing airports to specific projects. Given present policies and the forecast rate of traffic growth, any reduction in theBAA&apos;s forecast expenditure for the period could lead to a standard of service lower than is con-sidered necessary to maintain the internationallycompetitive position of the BAA airports.10. There can be no compromise on aircraftsafety, on the ground or in the air; passengerhandling facilities would therefore bear a disproportionately-portionate share of any economies, resulting in morecongestion in passenger terminals for more hours atpeak travelling periods, more congested car parks and access roads and a general diminution inamenities for the Authority&apos;s customers. The resultcould be an increasing loss of traffic, involving areduction in the BAA&apos;s revenue, inconvenience(and possibly loss of business) to business men, andan adverse effect on the tourist industry.11. The Authority&apos;s forecasts are based on theassumption that Maplin should be open and operational by 1980. Paragraph 83 in the section on Trade, industry and employment suggests thatthe opening date may be deferred by three years.This would not necessarily affect the phasing ofBAA expenditure at Maplin; but delay in BAAconstruction work of one year would for exampleproduce additional reductions in expenditure of 3 million in 1976-77 and  12 million in 1977-78.Delay in opening Maplin could however lead to a need for certain further expenditure at theAuthority&apos;s existing airports.

As noted in the commentary on the surveyfigures, there seems at present no realistic possibilityof reducing BWB investment below the levels shownthere; no lower costed option is therefore suggested.The NBC, NFC, BTDB and STG do not generallyenvisage increases in expenditure during the period,and a lower option for these would therefore beunreal. The investment proposed is the best estimate of the investment required to run their business.

Expenditure on roads covers construction,improvements, maintenance and lighting of (a)major roads, i.e. motorways, trunk and principalroads and (6) other roads and car parks. Expen-diture on new construction and improvement of major roads (including lighting) and on maintenance and lighting of motorways and trunk roads is eitherfinanced wholly by the Government or subject to specific Government grant. Maintenance ofprincipal roads (including lighting) and all expen-diture on other roads and car parks is a localgovernment responsibility and is government assisted only through the rate support grant. Thecapital element of this local authority expenditure on other roads is subject to only limited central control;in England and Wales it is confined to the overalllimit on capital expenditure for locally determinedprojects imposed under the terms of DOE Circular2/70 and Welsh Office Circular 116/70 and localauthorities are free to vary their expenditure withinthe total. It cannot, therefore, be estimated withthe same accuracy as the expenditure financedspecifically by Central Government.New Construction and Improvement2. Over the past decade expenditure on roadsincreased substantially to cater for the growth intraffic. Road vehicles in Great Britain increased from some 10 million in 1961 to 15 million in 1971;the weight of goods carried by road increased from1,240 million tons to 1,735 million tons; and thenumber of passenger miles from 143,000 million to over 245,000 million. Growth can be expectedto continue in all these sectors; by 1980 the numberof road vehicles is expected to increase to over20 million. New and improved roads are essential if there is not to be increasing congestion andaccelerating damage to the economy and environ-ment.3. The programme for new construction and improvement covers development of the maininter-urban network (motorways and trunk roads);of principal roads (mainly roads of similarimportance in and about urban areas); and otherroads. The bulk of the expenditure is on majorroads and rather more than half of this is on inter-urban roads.CONFIDENTIAL
4. Expenditure figures in the table broadly reflect the continuation of the existing policies shown in cmnd. 5178 but the date by which they can beachieved has been set back because of a shift of resources in England to assist housing and because ofthe cuts outlined in the Chancellors statement of21st May 1973. So far as motorways and trunk roads in England are concerned the trunk road net-work policy includes two major aims namely toassist in economic development and to improve the environment. It seeks to - achieve the former by providing links to the national network for the regions and a good system of roads to the airportsand ports, especially those of special significancefor trade with the rest of Europe. It seeks to achieve the latter by diverting long distance traffic form the centres of towns, especially historic ones,and to relieve them of noise, dirt and danger. the trunk road programmes for Scotland and wales have similar aims.5. Most journeys, however, take place in urbanor urbanised areas and it is in this context that theprincipal road programmes are of particular importance since they help to provide bypasses for small towns, to ease congestion in the suburbs andto cut congestion in town centres. But itis recognised that as well as bringing environmentalbenefits roads in towns can cause disruption to thecommunity. For that reason, the Government hastaken powers in the Land Compensation Act togive people better compensation and to limit thedamaging effects that a road might otherwise have.6. Cmnd. 5178 described the method of economicappraisal of road schemes. Consideration has beengiven to showing what expenditure on roads buys,as recommended by the Expenditure Committee1971-72, Eighth Report. No satisfactory measures have yet been found. Statistics of road miles builtor maintained suffer from the variability of costof land, carriage way widths, volume of traffic, etc.Although costs and benefits are assessed for individual schemes in the inter-urban road pro-gramme, no overall input and output measures have yet been found for roads expenditure as a whole,but work will continue on this subject.England7. The overall aims remain those outlined abovebut in Cmnd. 5178 the Secretary of State for the environment announced that he had reviewedpriorities within the field of his responsibilities and decided to place more emphasis on other aspects ofthe environment, and in order to make resources available for this, slightly to reduce the .rate of growth of expenditure on roads. That trendcontinues in this year&apos;s proposals with a further reduction in the rate of growth. It has also been affected by the decision to reduce public expenditurein 1974-75, which also has attendant effects on1973-74 and later years. The allocation of thereduction of  85 million at 1972 Survey prices which is  94 million at 1973 Survey prices asbetween capital and current, and major and otherroads is shown later.  In total, the policy cuts are:  million1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78200	94-0	49-1	54-5	50-98. The proposed overall increase in total expendi-ture on roads is 5-0 per cent a year from 1973-74to 1977-78 with an increase of 5-2 per cent between 1976-77 and 1977-78. (These figiires maybe compared with those for the preceding periodproposed in the 1972 Report, i.e. a growth rate of8-1,per cent from 1972-73 to 1976-77 ancl 6-7 percent between 1975-76 and 1976-77.) Within thesefigures expenditure on the Road Programme proper(new construction and improvement of motorways,trunk and principal roads,) is to grow by about-5 per cent a year as compared with a growth rate of 11 per cent proposed in the 1972 Reportfor the previous five-year period; this was howeverreduced to 6-8 per cent in Cmnd. 5178.Capital expenditure. The expenditure figures contained in the tableshow a reduced rate of growth throughout the survey period (and accordingly some recession ofthe date by which the network of strategic trunkroutes will be completed) to allow for policy changesincluding the effects of the Chancellors statement of21st May.

The effectof all these reductions has implications for expenditure well beyond the PESC period.10. The slow progression in principal roadexpenditure in Cmnd. 5178, which reflectedreductions rising to  30 million in 1976-77 is continued in the present proposals. As with the trunk Road programme, progress will be slowed down further by the cuts of 21st May and a contribution for mortgage interest rates. the reductions and their consequences are:  million1973-74    1974-75    1975-76    1976-7720 0        19-0        10-2 2-6
Proposals for roads in towns have to be related to public transport and to measures for traffic restraint,but, as suggested above, there will remain the needfor a substantial programme of road building in urban areas. Indeed, the Secretary of State hasalready approved in principle proposals within theGreater London Development Plan, which may leadto very substantial expenditure when they come tobe translated into work. Local authority capitalexpenditure failing in the locally determinedcategory under DOE Circular 2/70 e.g. non-principal roads, is expected to grow by about 4 percent a year on average but will be affected by a cut of  10 million for 1974-75.CURRENT EXPENDITUREMaintenance of motorways and trunk roads11. The maintenance programme for the trunk road system includes special expenditure to bringthe system to the standard proposed in the reportof the Marshall Committee. As indicated in Cmnd.5178 examination of the implications of therecommendations has continued. The detailedreport of the Transport and Road research laboratory&apos;s Working Parties on the economies ofhighway maintenance has aided the review. Therecosting of the forecasts of trunk road expenditureon existing policy exceeds Cmnd. 5178 revalued ineach year after 1973-74. The reasons are:(a) a revised assessment of the damaging powerof heavy vehicles;(b) the inadequacy of the earlier estimates tocover all the items required;(c) the estimate of a level of expenditure requiredto hold the standards once achieved.The pace at which this work can proceed has,however, been restricted by a cut of  10 million for1974-75.Local Authorities12. Local authority current expenditure is expectedto grow by an average of 6 per cent a year. Theprogression will, however, be uneven since it mustaccommodate a cut of  35 million for 1974-75 inaccordance with the Chancellors statement of 21stMay. This will mean holding back on any appreciable start to bringing roads up to the levelof maintenance recommended in the Marshallreport by reducing the level of expenditure estimated for 1974-75 during the last rate support grantnegotiation.Summary13. To the extent that the cuts last year and thisyear have involved postponement or abandonment of projects, this will mean greater delay anddiscomfort to road users, a worsening ofenvironmental conditions in many towns and villages and a substantial loss of the economic benefits that are derived from schemes designed tokeep traffic, including commercial vehicles, movingreasonably freely. For example, a by-pass canlead to a 50 per cent reduction of traffic in a townand a worthwhile reduction in noise levels.Expenditure on roads in England will be well belowthe level of Cmnd. 5178 revalued.Wales14. In the separate table for Wales, expenditure figures reflect the revaluation of the Cmnd. 5178provision adjusted to accommodate the followingreductions which arise partly as a consequence ofthe redirection of resources towards housing andpartly because of the decision to reduce public expenditure in 1974-75.  million1974-75    1975-76    1976-77    1977-782-70-61-01-3Reductions are spread fairly evenly over thecomponents of the programme.15. The M4 continues to be the main priority inSouth Wales and accounts for a substantial part ofthe motorway and trunk road expenditure in wales in this Survey period. The programme as a wholemaintains the continuation of the existing policies.16. Total expenditure is expected to grow by anannual average of 8-1 per cent over the period1973-74 to 1977-78. The 1977-78 provision is anincrease of 7-1 per cent over 1976-77.Scotland17. Between 1973-74 and 1977-78 expenditure is planned to increase by an annual average of 5 - 2 percent. The 1977-78 provision is 3-6 per cent abovethe 1976-77 figure.18. Major procedural difficulties continue toimpede the trunk road new construction programme.In particular, Court of Session proceedings on on every large scheme which was due to start in 1973-74 requires rephasing of expenditure in the period to1977-78. The 1977-78 bid is the same as the 1976-77 provision. The proposed level of expenditure would enable the Central Scotland motorway anddual carriageway programme originally scheduledfor completion in the early 1970s to be completed by 1977, and would also provide for the improve-ment by about 1978 in general to modern singlecarriageway standards of the trunk roads leading to the North and North East, i.e. the areas mostimmediately affected by North Sea oil development.Apart from these very high priority programmes,only a very limited number of trunk road schemescan be accommodated within the proposed provision and this is effectively limited to schemes which areof high priority, in an advanced state of preparation,or on which Ministerial commitments have been given.19. The principal road new construction pro-gramme in Central Scotland is designed to complement the trunk road programme. TheCmnd. 5178 revalued provisions have been reducedCONFIDENTIAL43
by  5 million over the period 1974-75 to 1976-77and the original bid for 1977-78 by  2 million to offset in part the additional expenditure on housingarising from the proposals contained in Cmnd. 5272and the 1974-75 provision has been further reducedby  1-8 million. Glasgow will continue to account for the major share of principal road expenditure asthe highest priority radial routes from the nowcompleted north and west flanks of the Inner RingRoad reach construction stage and as associatedurban renewal projects proceed.20. Apart from a reduction of  0-5 million in1974-75 trunk road maintenance is in line with theCmnd. 5178 revalued provisions. This reflects as lower phasing of expenditure than had beenscheduled early in 1972 for additional maintenance work arising from the recommendations of the marshall Committee Report and which will extend beyond the Survey period.21. Local authority capital and maintenance expenditure have been reduced by  0-5 million and 4-5 million in 1974-75; otherwise the remainingbids are broadly in line with Cmnd. 5178 revaluedprovisions. The only significant fluctuations result from the rephasing of expenditure on the additional public Works Programme 1971-73 and from thesmall allowance made in the later years of the review period for additional maintenance (arisingfrom the Marshall Committee Report) on localauthority roads.ALTERNATIVE POLICY IMPLICATIONSEngland and Wales22. Because of the need to find reductions in theroad programme in order to offset additional expenditure proposed for housing, the Departmentsshave been unable so far to identify any further savings that could be made for the purpose of helping to reconstitute the contingency reserve inthe later years of the period.23. As an indication of what might be possible if additional savings of the order of  35 million were necessary in the later years, the Treasury have putforward the figures in the following table. TheDOE maintain that if savings of the order of  35million by 1977-78 became necessary they wouldnot expect to achieve them by the pattern ofexpenditure proposed. The savings proposed,though small in percentage terms, would be furthercuts on a programme that has already suffered heavily. To be sure of achieving the savings, cutsmight have to fall on the areas under the Secretaryof State&apos;s immediate control motorways and trunk roads directly financed by the Department, and principal roads financed as to 75 per cent. the flow of work would be distorted with a waste of resources, and failure to realise the economic and environmental benefits that would have been derived from schemes that would have to be deferred or forgone.Scotland24. The Scottish figures in the table were producedto illustrate the consequences of further policy cutsin roads expenditure totalling 4 per cent over theperiod, in addition to the reductions already madeto offset the additional expenditure proposed for housing and the general reductions in 1974-75.The Scottish Development Department points outthat any reduction in the provision for trunk roadswould make it impossible to achieve minimal policyobjectives. The lower level of expenditure impliedfor principal roads in the later years could beachieved only by imposing a severe delay proportionate least one major scheme in Glasgow. Thereduction of 4 per cent on other local authoritycapital schemes which the figures imply could beachieved only by rejecting many necessary projects,which would be very controversial. The further reduction of 8 per cent implied in the provision fortrunk road maintenance, which was reduced in cmnd. 5178 would mean going back on Ministerialpromises of higher standards and would severelyaffect existing standards. About half of the impliedreductions involve local authority maintenance expenditure an 8 per cent reduction which would prevent any progress towards the higher standardsrecommended in the Marshall Report, and controlover this type of expenditure is not such as to ensurethat reductions of this order would be made.  million at 1973 Survey pricesRoads	1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78				england Normal programme Savings .	939-0	954-8	1,034-9 100	1,085-7 25-0	1,142-1 35-0Alternative policy	939-0	954-8	1,024-9	1,060-7	1,107-1wales Normal programme Savings .	73-4	77-2	85-6 0-5	93-4 10	1000 1-0Alternative policy	73-4	77-2	85-1	92-4	990scotland Normal programme Savings .	115-5 4-6	115-2	132-9 6-3	136-4 8-4	141-3 6-3Alternative policy	110-9	115-2	126-6	128-0	1350great britain Normal programme Savings .	1,127-9 4-6	1,147-2	1,253-4 16-8	1,315-5 34-4	1,383-4 42-3Alternative policy	1,123-3	1,147-2	1,236-6	1,281 1	\ 1,341-1VAT	11-7	12-2	13-4	13-7	14-3Total alternative policy	1,135-0	1,159-4	1,250 0	1,296-8	1,355-4

The Government provides a wide range offinancial assistance to public transport. Somegrants, such as the unremunerative railway servicegrants made to the British Railways Board (BRB),bus fuel grants and rural bus and ferry grants, aremade to help sustain existing transport services.Other grants, such as infrastructure grants, areaimed at improving the public transport services provided by nationalised industries and localauthorities in commuter areas.2. As stated in the House of Commons on 27thJuly 1972 by the Minister for Transport Industries,support to BRB additional to that provided underthe Transport (Grants) Act 1972 will be needed.Until the rail policy review is complete it is notpossible to assess how much additional support willbe needed, what form it will take and the public expenditure involved. In the meantime, provision has been included based on the best availableforecasts  of  the  revenue   shortfall  on  presentaccounting conventions. The increase over Cmnd.5178 revalued consists almost entirely of this additional support.Support to nationalised transport industries british railways board. Grants are made to the Board to cover their losses on unprofitable passenger services retained for social or economic reasons. The total level of grant is assumed to remain constant in real terms.This means that increases in real net costs willhave to be covered by operating economies and/orclosures. No assumption can yet be made aboutthe eventual viability of the London and SouthEast commuter network it is not expected thatthis will be achieved during the Survey period: theeffect of price restraint policies has been to widen the gap that would have to be closed by fareincreases   and   the   prospect   of   viability   has
therefore receded. At present, grants are payable in respect of some 212 services involving about,450 passenger route miles.national freight corporation4. The Transport Act 1968 provided for thepayment of up to  60 million in grants to the NFCover the five years from 1st January 1969.Provision is made for a final payment in 1973, but even if this is required the total amount paid willhave been well under  50 million at outturn prices.british waterways board. The provision covers the deficiency between theBoard&apos;s revenues and the minimum expenditureneeded to maintain the waterways.national bus company6. The Transport (Grants) Act 1972 provided fora special grant of  7 million in 1972 to enable theCompany to respond to the CBI initiative on priceswithout being in breach of its statutory duty.scottish transport group7. The provision covers subsidies to the Scottish transport Group, in respect of losses on WesternHighlands and Islands shipping services operated by its subsidiary David MacBrayne Ltd.Other Surface Transportports8. The estimates cover investment by theindependent harbour trusts and local authorityowned harbours together with loans to ports in theprivate sector. Provision is included for expenditure by the Port of London Authority on dredging and port facilities at Maplin.bus fuel grants9. The estimates reflect the continuing policy ofrefunding to operators of bus stage servicesincreases of fuel duty since 1964. The apparentdecrease in the level of grant results from thedeflation of the cash figures to a constant pricebasis and it is expected that grant will continue tobe payable in respect of about 1,700 million miles of stage carriage services run each year.rural bus and ferry services10. This provision comprises central Governmentand local authority assistance towards the provision,maintenance or improvement of bus and ferryservices for the benefit of people in rural areas.infrastructure expenditure11. This provision comprises gross expenditure bylocal authorities, Passenger Transport Executives,nationalised industries and to a small extent privatetransport   operators,   on   measures   designed  toimprove public transport in commuter areas,including all expenditure on fixed assets by BRB inthe London and the South East commuter area. Itis an increase over the period on Cmnd. 5178revalued of about  25 million and would ordinarilyhave covered the schemes, and their phasing,foreseen at that time which have since beenapproved or are now coming forward. Because ofunavoidable cost increases and a necessary forwardphasing of some schemes the proposed provision will not accommodate all the projects which havebeen approved; many of these are in the course of construction. To hold investment at the proposedlevels would therefore have serious implications forfurther schemes many of which are, on grounds ofpublic transport policy, of high priority. It isunderstood that DOE Ministers will be asking forthis provision to be increased at least so as to accommodate the priority schemes.other passenger transportLondon12. Detailed consideration of the investment programme of London Transport is a matter for the glc. The forecast shows little change from Cmnd.5178 revalued.Other13. The provision comprises investment estimates for the Passenger Transport Executives and the municipal transport undertakings together with newbus grants payable to the private sector. Apartfrom some increase in the last item the provisionshows little change from Cmnd. 5178 revalued.miscellaneous transport services14. The main items are road safety, rail research and receipts from fees for driving and vehicle tests.A small provision has been made for Department ofthe Environment expenditure in connection withthe Channel Tunnel. The project itself, if it wentahead, would, however, be financed mainly by private sector loans (Government guaranteed) whichwould not count as public expenditure.15. The provision for road safety is much thesame as in Cmnd. 5178 revalued and reflects the likely value of expenditure when road safetybecomes a statutory duty of the major localauthorities (which were designated in the LocalGovernment Act 1972 as road safety authorities).A PAR on road safety has recently been completed.16. Provision is again made for additional proto-type advanced passenger trains, with other conse-quential expenditure, in order to accelerate thedevelopment of the new train.

These costings include the provision for proto-type advanced passenger trains (APTs) referred to inparagraph 16 above and research on the gasturbine version. But the provision for grants forother railway research is limited to the 1972 Surveyfigures revalued.18. Provision is made for the four prototypesregarded as essential for the full testing of a passanger service. The justification for developmentof the advanced passenger train will be considered as part of the Railway Policy review. If it were decided not to proceed with the APT, the provision would be removed.19. The effect of reducing the provision for otherrailway research would be felt mainly in 1976-77and 1977-78. Reduction in support available fromthe Department would reduce the opportunities opento British Rail to engage in important research on,for example, new systems technology which mighthave an important effect on the future viability ofthe undertaking.Infrastructure  million	1973	1974	1975	1976	1977	-74	-75	-76	-77	-781973 Survey	88	88	82-2	85	85Alternative costing	88	88	82-2	75	75Saving	1		-	10	1020. Infrastructure was not one of the items theCabinet mentioned as a subject for a lower costedoption, and the Department has not proposed anyfigures. The Treasury considers, however, that since a large part of the programme in the later years is made up of projects which have not yet received Ministerial assent, there is scope for reduction (if only by delaying starts), shouldoverall financial constraints so dictate. TheTreasury therefore propose a saving of  10 million in each of the last two years, which should leaveexpenditure at a level sufficient to support projectsalready committed. The DOE point out that theGovernments policy is to give increasing support to public transport, and that these reductions would render such a policy impossible.15.  housing table 15   million at 1973 Survey prices	1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 outturn outturn  outturn			1971-72 1972-73 outturn provisional		1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77 1977-78 estimate estimate estimate estimate estimate								outturn				England Subsidies: Central government subsidies &apos; Rate fund contributions   .

Provision has also beenmade for the  15 million bridging grant to building societies to enable them to abate increases in mortgage interest rates for three months during1973. Pending final decisions on the level of future expenditure on the new policies (CM (73) 22ndMeeting refers) the gross costs over the period ofthe Survey have been assessed at about  550 million of which about one-third replaces expenditure whichwould otherwise have taken place under existinghousing policies.

Subsidies, rebates and allowances4. The system of subsidies to local authorities andNew Towns introduced under the Housing finance act 1972 and the Housing (Financial Provisions)(Scotland) Act, 1972 is intended to be responsive to the actual needs of the authorities and of their tenants. In England and Wales the broad principle is that these subsidies are designed to meet at least75 per cent of any reckonable deficit in the HousingRevenue Account. If income is sufficient to balanceexpenditure, no subsidies are paid. Thus resources are concentrated on those authorities whose reckon-able expenditure outstrips rental income, and enablesan authority, for example, to undertake new building without an unreasonable call upon therates or fixing rents at a higher level than reflects the fair rental value of the property. In additionlocal authorities are responsible for payment of rent allowances to private tenants and receivesubsidy on this account.5. The estimates turn critically on the assumptions about the extent to which increases in localauthority expenditure will be offset by rent increases.In England and Wales the average unrebated rentper dwelling in 1972-73 was about  153 a year.The estimates postulate an increase of  24 in 1973-74, followed by a continuing but flattening rate of increase to  222 in 1976-77, as fair rents are reached.An increase of  25 is assumed in 1977-78, following the statutory triennial review of fair rents during1976 and the next year. In Scotland the averagelocal authority standard rent at November 1972was  95-68. The fair rents system does not applyto the public sector in Scotland, but authorities arerequired to increase their rents at annual intervalsuntil they balance their Housing Revenue Accountswithout a deficit contribution from rates, and there-after towards meeting increases in expenditure.Balance will be achieved at different times by different authorities, but the estimates allow forannual increases to raise the average figure tosomewhat less than  200 by 1976-77.6. After 1973-74 residual subsidy (i.e. the mainsubsidy which phases out the old subsidy system)reduces sharply. That apart, the overall level of subsidies and of rate fund contributions under the1972 Housing Finance Acts is expected to remainfairly constant over the Survey period in Englandand Wales, while in Scotland some continuingdecline is anticipated.7. Rent rebate subsidy for England and Wales hasbeen calculated on the assumption of a 100 per centtake-up among tenants in receipt of supplementary benefit (1-2 million rising to 1-4 million over the survey period) and that take-up among the 750,000-800,000 qualifying tenants not in receipt ofsupplementary benefit will rise from its present levelof about 80 per cent to stabilise at about 90 per centin 1975-76. Rent allowance subsidy is based upona take-up level increasing from 50 per cent in1973-74 to 75 per cent in 1975-76 and later yearsamong those not getting supplementary benefit.Over the period the number of such tenants inunfurnished accommodation qualifying for an allow-ance is expected to decline from about 400,000 toperhaps 300,000. A 100 per cent take-up of allow-ance is included for private unfurnished tenantsreceiving supplementary benefit. Provision has beenmade for tenants of furnished accommodation onthe basis of the categories of such tenants eligible to claim allowances which have already beenprescribed. These categories comprise some 125,000tenants. The rebate and allowance figures do not include the contributions towards rent that are paidin supplementary benefit. Broadly the sameassumptions about take-up have been applied inrelation to the estimates for Scotland. It is expectedthat the number of tenants, not in receipt ofsupplementary benefit, who will receive rent rebateswill increase from about 220,000 in 1973-74 to260,000 in 1975-76 as rents increase. provision has been made for 14,000 private furnished tenants and tenants of furnished accommodation to receiverent allowances in 1973-74, this figure rising to20,000 in 1975-76.Option mortgage scheme8. The option mortgage scheme, which was introduced in 1968, is designed to help people withmoderate incomes to buy their own homes by giving them benefits roughly equal to those that areavailable to people with higher incomes through tax relief on mortgage interest. The number of optionmortgages continues to grow, as illustrated in thefollowing table:

By the end of 1972 there were over 400,000option mortgages. The amount payable varies notonly with the total number and value of optionmortgages, but also with the rate of interest. ThePESC estimate is based on the assumption that 15per cent of all new mortgages will be on the optionscheme.the building societies mortgage lending rate \ percent below what it would otherwise have been,typically 9\ per cent instead of 10 per cent. Theestimated cost is  15 million, all in 1973-74.Temporary bridging grant to building societies10. As a temporary measure the Government has announced a three-month subsidy in order to keepHouse improvement and slum clearance11. The growth in demand for improvement grantsis shown in the following table.IMPROVEMENT GRANTS APPROVED (not seasonally adjusted)Thousands of dwellings	For local authorities				For private owners and housing associations				For all owners																Discretionary		Standard	Total	Discretionary		Standard	Total	Discretionary		Standard	Total	Con-version	Improve-ment			Con-version	Improve-ment			Con-version	Improve-ment														Great Britain												1967   .	1-7	22-3	8-4	32-4	3-9	24-8	59-3	88-0	5-6	47-0	67-7	120-31968  .	1-9	28-8	10-3	41-0	4-4	23-4	59-2	87-0	6-2	52-2	69-4	127-81969  .	2-7	30-8	6-9	40-4	5-6	24-0	53-5	831	8-4	54-8	60-8	124-01970   .	2-9	48-0	8-5	59-4	12-3	460	62-1	120-4	15-2	94-0	70-7	179-91971   .	3-1	82-0	3-9	890	19-5	66-2	57-8	143-5	22-6	148-2	61-7	232-51972   .	3-7	128-5	4-5	136-7	27-9	145-8	57-5	231-2	31-6	274-3	62-1	368-012.  Between 1967 and 1971 approvals averaged and 56,500 in Scotland in anticipation of the138,000 a year in England and Wales and 19,000 a termination of the Housing Act 1971 in June 1974.year in Scotland. In 1972-73 there has been a peak In England and Wales a further 320,000 approvalsof approvals of some 339,000 in England and Wales are forecast for 1973-74, after which they are
expected to decline to about 250,000 by 1977-78: forScotland 56,000 for 1973-74 reducing to 35,000 in1977-78.13. Although the exceptionally high present level ofimprovement expenditure is expected to fall awayafter the expiry of the Housing Act 1971 (which provided 75 per cent rates of grant in the deyelop-ment and intermediate areas), and although localauthority investment on the improvement of theirown housing stock will probably decline as theresidue of older improvable council houses is reduced, a vigorous improvement programme is planned until the end of the decade. Ministers havealready taken a 1973 PAR on older housing andhave, reached a broad decision in favour of aredirection of policy towards areas of special housingneed. A provisional addition of  90 million hasbeen made for this in the forecasts since it is part ofthe Cmnd. 5280 and Cmnd. 5272 proposals.14. A survey in 1971 indicated that there are inEngland and Wales 1 - 2 million dwellings which aretechnically unfit. On the basis of changes found inthe 1971 survey since 1967 it is reasonable to assume that a further 800,000 houses will become unfitwithin the next 10 years. Given a rate of slum clearance at about present levels (70,000 a year) some700,000 unfit houses would be cleared over the sameperiod. (The Housing Finance Act 1972 shouldremove the financial constraints on the clearance ofunfit houses, but the rate of progress is likely to bedetermined by management and social as much as financial considerations.) This leaves over 1 millionunfit dwellings which is about the number whichcould be dealt with by means of improvement shouldthe rate at which they are improved be at least thatachieved between 1967 and 1971.15. Existing policy is however to improve morethan just housing which is technically unfit. It isnot possible accurately to quantify how many sub-standard houses require rehabilitation in one formor another, but a recent survey of all English localauthorities on the basis of a 12-point classification of standards indicated that, in their view, about million dwellings currently fall into this furthercategory. These, as well as the technically unfithouses would all be dealt with in about 10 years under the programme incorporated in this Survey.16. In Scotland it is estimated that about 190,000houses fail to meet the statutory minimum tolerablestandard. The rate of dosure or demolition in ,recent years has been about 18,000 a year. this rate is expected to increase as a result of the intro-duction of a specific subsidy for slum clearanceexpenditure, in the Scottish 1972 Act, together withthe Government^ drive to encourage local authoritiesto deal with all remaining houses which do not meetthe&quot; tolerable standard in the shortest possible time.Investment17. Approvals by local authorities have declined inrecent years and these together with approvals byNew Towns and the SSHA (but excluding subsidisedHousing Associations) have been projected forward as shown in the following table:Thousands			Year	England	Scotland	Wales1970 actual	94,460	20,824	5,1921971 actual	99,070	23,122	3,7001972 actual	75,300	28,567	2,1001973	69,000	22,000	4,5001974	70,000	22,000	4,0001975	70,000	23,000	4,0001976	70,000	23,000	4,0001977	70,000	23,000	4,00018. The Investment figures also make the following assumptions:(a) that local authorities will let contracts /forsome 5,000 houses a year specifically for sale.(b) that  they will  sell  some  35,000  existingdwellings a year to tenants.(c) that the demand for rented accommodation willin future be met to a greater extent byhousing associations (see paragraph 21below).New building to rent19. Outside the New Towns the number oi:dwellings put into contract depends on theaggregated decisions of all the local housing authorities. The national total has fallen over recentyears. From some 185,000 in 1967 the number had fallen to 104,000 in 1970 and fell further to 91,000in 1972. The decline reflects the fact that there isno longer a need to build as many council housesas possible everywhere. In many areas, the futureneed is mainly to provide for special categories,e.g. the elderly. The need for continuing large scale building for general needs is now concentrated on the larger towns.20. Any estimate of future local authority activity in new house-building is necessarily speculative.Performance in the recent past has fallen well belowexpectations of the housing departments. reactions to the impact of the Housing Finance Acts are stilldifficult to judge as is the impact of local govern-ment reorganisation. The general need for rented accommodation in London remains great and might result in higher levels of new house-building bylocal authorities there. Slum clearance losses are estimated at about 84,000 a year and other losses(e.g. redevelopment for other reasons) at about22,000 a year! A substantial but uncertain numberof those displaced (relatively more in Scotland thanin  England  and  Wales  because of its  higher
^proportion of public housing) will look to the localauthorities for accommodation. In addition, overthe country as a whole, accommodation for the elderly (where the general objective is to enable as many as possible to live within the community) isnot always satisfactory and, as the reorganisedlocal authorities begin to take a wider view oftheir housing functions, it may be that they will do more for other special needs which in the past mayhave been neglected, e.g. the disabled.21. On the other hand these needs do not alwayscall for new building. The local authority housingstock is now substantial and with re-let ratesgenerally higher than in the past new needs can toa greater extent be absorbed through vacancies.The measures announced in Cmnd. 5280 and Cmnd.5272 will provide an alternative to renting a councildwelling for more people than hitherto and thistogether with a continuing trend towards owner occupation accounts for much of the lower level of council house building now envisaged.      *Building for sale by local authorities22. Hitherto local authority building for sale hasbeen generally discouraged and has fallen well short of 1,000 dwellings in each of the last three years.As Cmnd. 5280 envisages, the Government is nowasking local authorities to come forward withschemes designed to meet local needs for lowerpriced houses for sale which are not fully satisfied by developers. It is envisaged that schemes coveringof the order of 5,000 such dwellings a year arelikely to be approved over the next five years.Sale of existing council houses23. The number of sales in England and Wales has risen substantially over the last two years. with strong Government encouragement more localauthorities are selling than ever before and moretenants want and are able to buy. In 1972, 42,000houses were sold by 579 authorities, as against16,000 by 403 authorities in 1971 and 6,000 by 227authorities in 1970. The estimate is for some 35,000sales a year from 1973 onwards. The level of sales in Scotland is very much lower and the estimatesenvisage no more than 500 sales a year.Local authority lending to private individuals24. Local authorities lend to private individualsfor house purchase and for house improvements;they also make loans to housing associations.Almost 80 per cent of local authority lending is for house purchase.25. The purpose of local authority lending for house purchase is defined in circular DOE 22/71as &quot; to meet housing needs, or to further housingpolicies, which would not otherwise be met orfurthered &quot;. Lending is therefore restricted to the priority categories of borrower listed in the circularsuch as the homeless, people high on a Councilswaiting list or displaced by local authority develop-ment, and people wishing to buy older property which would not attract a commercial mortgage.Similar arrangements apply in Scotland.26. Local authority lending therefore is additional to lending by building societies and other institutions and tends to fill in the gaps which they leave. Itis difficult to trace any exact correlation in recentyears between the levels of building society lendingand local authority lending if only because thelatter has been subject to limitations of one kindor another, but there is always a tendency for localauthority lending to rise Jwhen building societyfunds are in short supply and to fall when building society funds are plentiful. The lending figuresalso include provision for the finance of localauthority sales of existing houses to their owntenants, and of new houses built for sale by localauthorities.27. The following table illustrates the pattern oflocal authority lending to private owners for house purchase (excluding loans for the purchase of council houses). Since 1965 lending has been limited, first by quota (in 1966-69) and subsequentlyby restriction to the priority categories of borrowers.As a result it is now mainly directed to loans forthe purchase of existing (usually cheaper), houses and the number of loans on new houses has fallensubstantially. These trends are not expected to change though the precise number of loans willfluctuate from year to year.Local authorities: England and WalesThousandsAll dwellings		New dwellings1960  .	47-9	18-51961   .	62-3	21-81962   .	.,,     .          53-4	21 01963   .	57-6	18-91964   .	77-2	24-01965   .	87-1	21-31966   .	46-2	13-81967   .	56-6	11-31968   .	38-8	11-11969   .	19-1	9-51970   .	44-1	5-91971   .	47-2	5-81972   .	45-2	4-2Lending by the Housing Corporations and by localauthorities to housing associations28.

In addition, overthe country as a whole, accommodation for the elderly (where the general objective is to enable as many as possible to live within the community) isnot always satisfactory and, as the reorganisedlocal authorities begin to take a wider view oftheir housing functions, it may be that they will do more for other special needs which in the past mayhave been neglected, e.g. the disabled.21. On the other hand these needs do not alwayscall for new building.

The figures for these programmes show asubstantial increase to give effect to the decisionsannounced in Cmnds. 5280 and 5272. The white paper pointed to the continuing decline of theprivate rented  sector; this is illustrated in the
following table which shows that between December1966 and December 1972 the number of privatelyrented dwellings in Great Britain fell from 3-3 million !to 2-6 million. This has the effect ofcrowding private tenants into fewer houses. Over-crowding, rising rents for furnished accommodation,and poor housing conditions are thereby increased.Especially in areas of housing stress, the physicalcondition of the stock is often poor and the privatelandlord has little incentive to improve it even withthe benefit of grant. The decline in this sector isgenerating a shortage of inexpensive rented accommodation. The aim is to try to overcomethis as far as possible through the voluntary housingmovement to counter the tendency towards amunicipal monopoly of rented accommodation. Aswith the other Cmnd. 5280 and Cmnd. 5272expenditure, additional expenditure of the order of 430 million over the period has been provisionallyincorporated in the forecasts for this purpose.STOCK OF DWELLINGS      BY TENURE	Rented from local authorities or new town corporations		Owner occupied		Rented from private owners		Other tenures4			If n ; Total	Thousands	Per cent of total	Thousands	Per cent of total	Thousands	Per cent of total	Thousands	Per cent of total		England										1966	4,016	26-7	7,354	48-8	2,901	19-3	782	5-2	15,053	1967   .	- 4,145	27-1	7,584	49-6	2,779	181	790	5-2	12,298	1968   .	4,267	27-4	7,834	50-4	2,657	17-1	798	5-1	15,995	1969   .	4,390	27-8	8,029	50-9	,   2,559	16-2	795	5-0	15,773	1970   .	4,513	28-2	8,214	51-4	2,461	15-4	792	50	15,980	1971    .      .      .	4,599	28-4	8,427	52-1	2,371	14-6	788	4-9	16,185	1972   .      .      .	4,626	28-3	8,681	.....53-0	2,281	13-9	784	4-8	16,372	Wales										1966   .	238	26-5	470	52-4 [j	143	16-0	46	51	897	1967   .	248	27-2	481	52-6	138	15-1	47	5-1	914	1968   .	255	27-4	495	53-2	132	14-3	47	51	929	1969   .	264	28-0	505	53-7	127	13-5	47	5-0	943	1970   .    &apos; .	272	28-5	516	54-0	121	12-7	46	4-8	955	1971    .      .	277	28-6	528	54-6	116	12-0	46	4-5	967	1972   .      .	277	28-3	543	55-5	113	11-5	46	tt,   4-7	979	Scotland										1966   .     &apos;.      .	810	47-4	494	28-9	287	16-8	119	6-9	1,710	1967   .	841	48-6	505	29-2	264	15-3	119	6-9	1,729	1968   .	868	49-6	518	29-6	243	13-9	120	6-9	1,749	1969   .	834	50-5	529	29-8	229	12-9	120	6-8	1,772	1970   .	921	51-3	540	300	216	12-0	120	6-7	1,797	1971    .	948	52-3	553	30-5	195	10-7	119	6-5	1,815	1972   .	969	53-0	567	31 0	175	9-6	118	6-5	1,829	Great Britain										1966   .	5,064	28-7	8,318	47-1	3,331	18-8	947	5-4	17,660	1967   .	5,234	29-2	8,570	47-8	3,181	17-7	956	5-3	17,941	1968   .	5,390	29-6	8,847	48-5	3,032	16-6	965	5-3	18,234	1969   .	5,548	30-0	9,063	49-0	2,915	15-8	962	5-2	18,488	1970   .	5,706	30-5	9,270	49-5	2,798	14-9	958	5-1	18,732	1971   .	5,824	30-7	9,508	50-1	2,682	14-2	953	5-0	18,967	1972   .      .	5,872	30-7	9,791	51-1	2,569	13-4	948	4-9	19,180											(&apos;) New estimates based on the 1971 Census will be prepared as soon as the national housing data become available.

Expenditure on water and sewerage in Englandand Wales has been reduced below the figures givenin Cmnd. 5178. These reductions, involving a slowing down of the programme, have been made asa result of the need to meet additional expenditureon housing announced in Cmnd. 5280, and to reducepublic expenditure in 1974-75. The savings at 1973Survey prices are as follows:  million	1973	1974	1975	1976	1977	-74	-75	-76	-77	-78England   .	.    16-9	28-3	14-0	10-9	7-wales	0-4	2-3	_____-....		 A steadily increasing programme of expenditure will still be required to cope with the demand for water,which is expected to double between now and theend of the century, to combat water pollution andthe risk of flooding, to replace outworn sewers andto provide additional facilities for new housing andindustrial expansion. Over the Survey periodexpenditure on water is expected to rise by 25 - 9 percent and on sewerage including New Towns by 27 - 8 per cent.3. The Water Bill now before Parliament providesthat the responsibility for these services shall betransferred to new Regional Water Authorities on1st April 1974. This concentration of functions intoa small number of strong authorities should ensurethat outstanding problems, particularly the need todevelop further large-scale sources of water and toimprove effluent standards, are attacked with muchgreater vigour and in a way which secures maximum efficiency and economy. The Departments thereforebelieve that it may be necessary later to review thepresent rate of growth. In the Treasury&apos;s view, any increase in the rate of growth would represent achange in existing policy.
CONFIDENTIAL---4. Provision for sewerage programmes in new towns shows some increase in expenditure in1974-75, 1975-76 and 1976-77 over that cpntem-plated in Cmnd. 5178. This is mainly due toadvancement of the sewerage works schemes inMilton Keynes and Central Lancashire which is needed to keep pace with the housing programmes in those towns. In addition provision has beenmade for expenditure in the new town proposed tobe included in the Maplin development.5. Much of the expenditure under the heading&quot; Improvement of the environment and localfacilities &quot; is directly related to the housing pro-gramme, e.g. land acquisition for private housing;public open spaces; and town expansion. Theestimates reflect changes in the forecasts of additional expenditure and receipts arising from the specialprogramme of land acquisition for resale for private housing development referred to in Cmnd. 5178.For various reasons the response of the localauthorities has been slower than expected, and it has there fore been necessary to rephase the programmeso that part of it now falls in 1974-75. Authoritieshave also experienced difficulty in financing, without additional loan sanctions, the related works that arerequired in order to make the land acquired ripe for building. To remedy the situation 20 per cent of theoriginal provision in England is being earmarked forminor road works and for sewerage and sewage disposal. The revised provision included for pur-chases of land and receipts in England and Wales inthe Survey period, is as follows:  million	1973	1974	1975	1976	1977	-74	-75	-76	-77	-78Expenditure	51-2	18-7			Proceeds from sales   .		11-4	35 0	46-4	11-36. The Secretaries of State have decided to makereductions to the forecasts of expenditure on theimprovement of the environment and local facilities to provide for additional resources for the new housing policies and also to contribute to the savings in public expenditure necessary in 1974-75. the resultant reductions are:  million1973 1974 1975 1976 1977-74     -75     -76     -77     -78special allowance is made for the demand for newpremises and depots by the new local authoritiesafter reorganisation. These will therefore have to be accomodated at the expense of other projectsaccording to the local authorities&apos; own priorities.7. The bulk of local authority expenditure on other public health and on improvement of the environ-ment falls in the locally determined sector under thearrangements for controlling capital expenditureintroduced in April 1971. Present indications are that this is resulting in some redistribution ofexpenditure either within miscellaneous local services or between the various programmes which includelocally determined expenditure.8. The provision for New Towns industrial and commercial development takes account of arephasing of programmes by some j of the Corpora-tions. Town centre redevelopment schemes atMilton Keynes and Peterborough are being brought forward because housing development is proceeding at a quicker rate than expected, ji^hile at Peterleeand Warrington more industrial building is to beundertaken to meet increasing demand. In order,however, to provide offsetting policy savings for housing the Department of the Environment intends to encourage a rather faster disposal of mature com-mercial assets by new town corporations. This will produce the following savings: j11   million1973-74    1974-75    1975-76    1976-77    1977-781 0 3 0 5-0 5-09. The Sport figures have been increased comparedwith Cmnd. 5178. The figures still fall well short of what the Sports Councils themselves would liketo be available for assistance towards individual projects.10. The forecasts for arterial land drainage inEngland and Wales include expenditure on the thames Flood Barrier and associated works, bothinterim works, required upstream and permanentworks downstream of the proposed barrier. the forecasts for land drainage (including sea defencebut excluding Thames Flood Prevention Works)compare as follows with the figures in Cmnd. 5178revalued   millionEngland . . . 5-6 55-5 30-5 39-6 51-wales      .      .      .     -      2-3     0-7     1-0     1-4These reductions do not imply any slackening of demand for greater expenditure in improving the environment, or in providing sports and recreational facilities.

Expenditure on these projects and on a majorscheme which is proposed for the East Moleseyarea accounts for the increases in 1974-75 to1976-77.11. The forecasts for the Thames Flood PreventionWorks represent the latest figures of expected expen-diture by the Greater London Council and the Essexand Kent River Authorities. Projected expenditureon the Thames defences compares as follows withthe figures in Cmnd. 5178 revalued   million	1973	1974	1975	1976	1977	-74	-75	-76	-77	-78Cmnd. 5178 revalued .	18-8	36-6	390	36-4	_1973 Survey	13-8	36-3	38-5	34-3	21-7These figures reflect a more realistic assessment of cost estimates than was possible in 1972 whenthe forecasts for the Thames scheme, althoughincluded in the total figures for land drainage, werenot separately identified in the Survey Report. Thisis a unique engineering project of major complexityand further estimating changes must be regardedas inevitable.research12. The provision takes account of the sums trans-ferred to the DOE from DES in respect of expen-diture by the Natural Environment research council, in accordance with Cmnd. 5046; and ofcertain other adjustments between departmentsconsequent upon implementation of the customer/contractor principle.13. The figures provide for the increase in theDepartments research programme agreed in previous years to provide the necessary research support forthe Departments policies. Provision is at a lower level than Cmnd. 5178 revalued because allowance has been made for the probability of delay in certainresearch projects.scotland14. In Scotland the forecasts for sewerage overthe Survey period are slightly greater than the comparable figures in Cmnd. 5178. This increase is required to meet the increasing pressure to provide facilities of an adequately modern standard. Theprovision for industrial and commercial development by the Scottish New Towns, all of which have&quot; Special Development Area Status &quot; is based upona reappraisal of their prospects and is also somewhat higher than in Cmnd. 5178 revalued. these increases are however more than offset by downwardestimating changes in expenditure on the improve-ment of the environment.15. The forecasts for Scotland have been further reduced by policy savings to produce contributions to the cost of the new housing policies and to the reductions in public expenditure in 1974-75.  Thesesavings are as follows:		  million1973-74    1974-75    1975-76    1976-77	1977-780-7          4-6          -          1-0	2 current Expenditure16. The forecasts for 1973-74 reflect the rate support Grant Order 1972 and the Rate support grant Order (Scotland) 1972. For subsequent years the forecasts generally project forward the expen-diture trends which were taken into account in these orders save that for 1974-75 reductions have beenmade of  12-7 million in England and Wales, and 0-6 million in Scotland to secure savings in public expenditure. These reductions are not at presentreflected in the forecast of expenditure for the yearsafter 1974-75. The implication of reducing theseforecasts of local authority expenditure in these years to take account of the lower level of current expenditure now expected in 1974-75 are set outin Annex D to the Main Report (page 20). Forthis programme if the savings in 1974-75 were tobe reflected fully in the forecasts for subsequent years, the following reductions from the figurespresently shown would arise:  million	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78			England and Wales . Scotland	13-3 0-6	13-9 0-7	14-5 0-7The capital reductions which have been made in1974-75 may also result in some consequentialreductions in current expenditure in subsequent years. It is not possible to assess at present howgreat such reductions might be.17. The Departments consider that the reducedfigures for 1975-76 and subsequent years above would be unrealistic. The original figures in Cmnd.5178 already represented less than the localauthority associations considered to be the trueneeds of local authorities, bearing in mind the effects of local government reorganisation and the rapid development of planning services. Present indica-tions are that outturn of expenditure in 1972-73and 1973-74 may prove to be higher on these services than was forecast, and in the view of DOEofficials the adoption of reduced figures agreed by ministers for 1974-75 for the purposes of the rate support grant negotiations will not necessarilyensure that authorities will reduce their expenditure to this extent. Thus in the Department^ view itwould be incorrect to present the unaltered figures
for 1975-76 as producing the growth of 5-7 per cent over the reduced 1974-75 forecasts that they wouldseem to suggest.18. Within the existing forecasts, specific provision has been included, as in Cmnd. 5178, for the extracosts expected to flow from local government reorganisation. These include elections, initialexpenses of the new authorities who in 1973-74 willin England and Wales overlap with the existing authorities, the costs of winding up the existing authorities and staff compensation.19. In the rate support grant settlements theGovernment decided that joint action was requiredby central and local government to keep down theincrease in rates in 1973-74. The settlements there-fore made allowances for a reduction of  10 million in England and Wales and  1 million in Scotlandfrom the level of current expenditure which might otherwise have been expected, as the localauthorities&apos; contribution to this joint action. As in cmnd. 5178 this reduction in expenditure has for convenience been set against Miscellaneous local services. In practice, however, the savings will be shared by other local authority programmes.20. Local authority expenditure in the threepountriesj, excluding provision for reorganisationincreases over the Survey period by an average ofabout 4-5 per cent in England and Wales and 5per cent in Scotland.ALTERNATIVE POLICY IMPLICATIONSLocal authority expenditure21. The figures in the table below represent the sort of savings on local authorities&apos; capitalexpenditure that the Treasury consider might be looked for in the later years of the Survey period if ministers wished to secure reductions over and above those so far offered as contributions to thecost of the new housing policies and to the public expenditure reductions in 1974-75. They are designed to secure a comparable level of savings tothat achieved in 1974-75, and would be sought bywithholding approval for projects within the keysector (mainly water and sewerage) and by reducinglocal authorities&apos; allocations for locally determinedcapital expenditure:  million1975-76     1976-77     1977-78EnglandWales   .Scotland44454344414453514922. The Treasury believes that such savings mightbe expected to produce consequential reductions in local authority current expenditure.    It is notpossible to assess how great these savings wouldbe and further discussions with the departments would be necessary if Ministers decided to impose the reductions in capital expenditure proposed.23. Apart&apos; from those savings in current expenditure which could be expected to follow from cuts in capital expenditure as above, it is notpossible for the Treasury to identify independentchanges in policy which would ensure reductions incurrent expenditure on miscellaneous local services.The possibility of such reductions might howeverneed to be considered further in the light of theGovernments policy towards the development oflocal authorities&apos; current expenditure as a whole inthe context of the rate support grant negotiations.24. The present forecasts of current expendituredo not include provision for the new allowances for local authority elected members, the level of whichhas not yet been agreed by Ministers. It is notpossible at present to quantify the overall cost ofthe new allowances, but the Departments view isthat it might increase expenditure in 1974-75 and subsequent years by about  19 million in GreatBritain. Whatever the cost of the new allowances,it must, in the Treasury view, be found by offsetting savings by the three Departments.25. In the Departments&apos; view, the reduction which ministers have already made in the figures for1974-75 will be extremely difficult to achieve andthe position will be made even worse if they are tobe continued into later years. Over half the total capital programme is for water and sewerage. Whileit might be possible to reduce the rate of growth in later years this would require a specific Ministerialannouncement that the planned programme forcleaning up estuaries and rivers would have to be postponed, and that the new Regional water authorities&apos; expenditure on water and sewerageservices was to be restrained. It would be necessaryto accept that the housing programme and industrialdevelopments might be affected by such restraint.26. The Departments also consider that theproposed lower figures for locally determinedexpenditure could have very serious implications.The reductions already made for 1974-75 will makeit extremely difficult for local authorities to meet their continuing commitments on existing projects,let alone to meet the problems arising fromreorganisation, but at least it can be argued thatprojects are being postponed for one year only. to seek continued postponements to the extentsuggested by the Treasury would make for an impossible situation which might even result in a breakdown of the locally determined scheme.27. The Departments also doubt whether the consequential reductions in current expendituresuggested are realistic since if capital expenditure is
restricted on the lines suggested, authorities will tend to rent or lease premises and equipment thatthey would otherwise have purchased.28. The position is different in Scotland becausecontrol by block allocations in the locally determined sector is practised in respect of only three of the large authorities. Further reductions to the Cmnd. 5178 figures over and above those already made, would require the Scottish Office tosecure the deferment of schemes that would be approved under current policy. This would be particularly difficult with the growing need forinfrastructure support for North Sea oil.New towns industrial and commercial development29. If it was necessary to override the New Towns&apos;authorities&apos; commercial judgment, which would demand an overt policy intervention, it would inthe Treasury&apos;s view be possible to increase thedisposal of assets beyond the extent intended. TheDepartment is unable to estimate what might be feasible or how economic this would be. TheTreasury therefore offer the following arbitraryfigures, based on those in paragraph 8, as an indication of the order of magnitude.  million1973	1974	1975	1976	1977-74	-75	-76	-77	-782	3	3	5	5Research  million	1973	1974	1975	1976	1977	-74	-75	-76	-77	-781973 Survey	14-2	18-3	20-7	22-6	23-3Alternative costing	13-3	17-6	20-4	22-4	22-8Saving	0-9	0-7	0-3	0-2	0-530.   Expenditure	at this	lower	level	would	havevarious effects depending.on which projects had tobe deferred or dropped. But the following maineffects are likely :(a) the benefit in future years of research aimed at improving the efficiency of the much more,substantial DOE main spending programmes would be forgone and(b) there would have to be a reduction of currentefforts to improve by research the under-standing of major environmental problems,such as the future of central urban areas,thus adversely affecting the ability to formulate appropriate policies.31. The Department therefore consider thatresearch should be a very high priority and they attach considerable importance to the need tomaintain the figures proposed for inclusion in the1973 Survey, which have been reduced to theminimum consistent with the necessary researchsupport for the Department^ main expenditures.17.

HOME DEPARTMENTS&apos; SERVICESPoliceengland and wales. Police expenditure is expected to increase by16-8 per cent over the Survey period. The estimates are based on the assumption that police manpowerwill rise from 100,500 (750 less than was assumed in Cmnd. 5178) to 116,150 compared with a growth of about 8,900 over the previous five year period.Civilian strengths are expected to increase from40,450 (2,200 less than was assumed in Cmnd. 5178)to 50,350. Included in these figures is provision for ,000 traffic wardens (1,000 below the figureassumed in Cmnd. 5178) which, in the light of experience, is regarded as a more realistic assess-ment of the growth which can be achieved.2. As in previous Surveys the major part of theincrease in current expenditure stems from the projected increase in police and civilian manpower.The strength figures start from a lower base thanenvisaged in the 1972 Survey due to an increase inwastage and a somewhat smaller increase inrecruitment than had been expected; and reflect theagreement reached in rate support grant negotiations on a lower growth rate for traffic wardens.Otherwise recruitment assumptions are littlechanged.3. The estimates allow for increased capitalexpenditure on the purchase of sites and theconstruction of operational buildings arising fromthe very substantial forward programme submittedby police authorities. This has been met by areduction in the expenditure on new dwellings whichreflects the policy of police authorities to permitpolice officers to purchase their own houses. Thecapital estimates also include provision for replace-ment buildings for forensic science laboratories; for police district training centres and for expansion ofthe Police College. Continued provision is made forthe Police National Computer.4. Apart from the manpower requirementsmentioned above the current expenditure estimatesprovide for an expansion of the programme of research into police methods, equipment and communications; equipment of the forensic sciencelaboratories and police district training centres; andthe use of contract labour to implement changes inthe fire and police wireless schemes resulting fromthe reorganisation of local government boundaries.These increases are partially offset by a reduction inestimates for the running costs of the Police NationalComputer due to more precise figures becoming available as the project develops.noteSince the Report was drafted it seems unlikely thatrecruitment will come up to the expectation of the forecasts. No change is proposed in the policy of encouraging police recruitment and there are to beno restrictions in recruitment. But as part of the cuts announced by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 21st May 1973,  10 million and  4-5 millionhas been deducted from police current expenditurein 1973-74 and 1974-75 respectively, to reflect the likely shortfall in recruitment and the expectation that in a general climate of restraint local authorities will reduce other current expenditure on goods and services. Similar savings of  4-5 million in each ofthe subsequent years of the Survey are to beexpected.Capital expenditure on building projects has alsobeen reduced by  1-1 million in 1973-74, by  2-million in 1974-75 and by  1-0 million in each ofthe subsequent years of the Survey in accordancewith the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ announce-ment of 21st May.scotland5. The expenditure is expected to increase by 8&apos;per cent over the period. The estimates assume thatthe police strengths will rise from 11,350 to 12,200and civilian strengths from 3,430 to 4,540 this latter figure provides for 1,230 traffic wardens. Theincrease in police strengths starts from a higher basethan previously forecast as a result of increasedrecruitment the rate of which is expected to reducefrom 1974-75 onwards. The estimate for 1974-75incorporates reductions of  0-5 million (police) and 0 -1 million (fire) in local authority current expenditure as part of the provisional distributionof the Chancellors cut in expenditure on scottish local authority services. The actual distribution willbe settled in the course of discussions with the localauthorities.Prisonsengland and wales6. Expenditure on prisons is expected to rise by36 - 8 per cent over the period. The estimates providefor the continuation of the prison building pro-gramme against a background of seriously over-crowded establishments as described in Cmnd. 5178.Although the prison population is below the levelpreviously expected, the rising trend in population is expected to be resumed. The main assumptionsare that during the Survey period the total inmatepopulation will rise from 42,300 (compared with45,500 assumed in Cmnd. 5178) to 50,300 and thatthere will be an increase of 5,500 non-industrialstaff in all grades.7. The staff growth taken in conjunction with the revised projections of inmate population should bring about an improvement in the present non-industrial staff/inmate ratio of 1:2-7 and by the endof the period this is expected to be 1:2-4. but because, for example, the proposed new establish-ments with better facilities require on average ahigher staff/inmate ratio than existing establishments,the staff growth is unlikely to lead to any significant
9reduction in overtime working. The estimatesprovide for an increase in the number of probationofficers seconded for welfare duties in prisons inEngland and Wales and for their introduction intotraining borstals. It is expected that 420 will be so employed in 1973-74 rising to 540 in 1977-78.These figures are consistent with those quoted in cmnd. 5178 as are those for ancillary workers (12in 1973-74 rising to 178).8. The capital programme has been phased tomaintain starts at about 3,000 new places each yearup to 1975-76. The level of starts beyond 1975-76will need to be reviewed in the light of the populationtrends but present plans assume a lower rate ofstarts which will enable the place-producing part ofthe programme to be concentrated to a greater extent on &quot; one-off&quot; and specialist establishments to meetparticular rather than general needs. Subject tothis reservation, the programme continues to placemost emphasis on the provision of more Category Cadult training prisons and young offender accom-modation. The use of inmate labour, wherever possible, continues to be a feature of the programme.9. The programme assumes provision of about13,000 places over the period.10. There are still about 12,000 prisoners sleepingtwo or three in a cell, but it has been possible in thelast two years to reduce substantially the numberthree in a cell. It is the intention to continue to place the emphasis on reducing the number three in acell. Assuming the timely completion of the schemes in the current programme, and the projected size ofthe prison population, there is unlikely to be a significant reduction in the total number sharingcells, but the proportion of the inmate populationdoing so will fall.11. The estimates provide for over 4,500 quarters for prison officers during the period, an assumptionconsistent with Cmnd. 5178.12. The estimates provide for a continuation of theprogramme of expenditure on prison industriesleading to increased production and sales.13. The estimates do not take any account of possible cost implications of:(i) the forthcoming report of the AdvisoryCouncil on the Penal System on the youngoffender part of the prison service; and(ii) the review of dispersal policies ordered by ministers following the disturbances atGartree.scotland14. The expenditure is expected to increase by33-7 per cent over the period. The capital pro-gramme is necessary to cope with the presentovercrowding in which 1,900 inmates are sleepingtwo or three to a cell, and also the expected rise inthe total inmate population from 5,650 to 7,000 in1977-78. The programme will provide 3,100additional places in the Survey period and thusovercome both the present overcrowding and the projected rise in the prison population. Theincreased expenditure also provides for an additional750 quarters for prison officers; allowance has alsobeen made for an increase in current expenditure,largely attributable to the need to recruit 960additional non-industrial staff of all grades over theperiod.Probation and after-careengland and wales15. Expenditure is expected to rise by 48 - 3 per cent over the Survey period. The main assumptions(which are consistent with Cmnd. 5178) are that thenumber of probation officers will rise from 3,775to 5,300 over the Survey period and ancillary staff from 240 (210 in Cmnd. 517^8) to 400. The estimatesprovide for the continued expansion of the probationservice. They allow for an increase of 1,800 places in adult hostels and bail hostels; the setting up by1976-77 of 78 Community Service Schemes and DayTraining Centres under the control of probation andafter-care committees, after the initial experimentalintroduction of these new services; and the continuedprovision of 200 additional places each year involuntary after-care hostels.16. The estimates for training probation students(including prison welfare officers) are based on an output of 660 trained students in 1974 and 745 in1975 and subsequent years. For the years 1976-77and 1977-78 provision is made for the increased costs attributable to a switch of emphasis from one-year to two-year training courses for non-graduatestudents.Fire services england and wales17. Expenditure is expected to rise by 9-7 per cent over the period. The manpower assumptions are broadly consistent with Cmnd. 5178. The numberof whole-time firemen will rise from 26,080 to26,880 and civilian staffs from 4,360 to 5,180. Thenumbers of retained (part-time) and junior firemenare consistent with Cmnd. 5178, as are the manpowerassumptions for improved trainings18. It is not now proposed to provide a centralrecruit training establishment as recommended by theDepartmental Committee on the Fire Service (seeCmnd. 5178) and savings amounting to  0-7 million in total in current expenditure have been made by comparison with Cmnd. 5178 figures for the years1975-76 and 1976-77. There is no correspondingsaving in capital expenditure, since it is expected that local authorities will need to incur expenditure onimproving local recruit training facilities. The fore-casts include provision for building requirements atthe Staff College.* See Note * following paragraph 21.CONFD3ENTIAL65
19. Responsibility for certain fire research projectspreviously included in the Miscellaneous local services programme by the Department of the environment and estimated to cost  1-2 million overthe years 1973-74 to 1976-77, has been transferredto the Home Office.20. Local authority capital expenditure on fire services is now part of the &quot; locally determinedpool&quot; and it is not possible to make accurateestimates for the individual services. provision made in the Survey period is the Cmnd. 5178estimates revalued and projected forward one year.f21. Provision has been made in the estimates forthe effects of the Fire Precautions (Loans) Act 1973which proposes that loans should be made available by local authorities to facilitate improvements to small hotels and boarding houses necessitated by the fire Precautions Act 1971. The estimates are neces-sarily imprecise. The estimates of net lendingexclusive of interest charges and assuming a 10-yearloan period are:  million1973-74    1974-75    1975-76    1976-77    1977-7810 1-4 1-8 10 0-9The Home Office take the view that this expenditure should not be absorbed within the ceiling for Lawand Order; and that it should more properly be allocated to Miscellaneous Local Services under thecontrol of the Department of the Environment.However, as the Home Office will be responsible forthe general administration of the loans scheme, theTreasury consider that the expenditure should be allocated to Fire Services. *Note :* As part of the cuts announced by the Chancellorof the Exchequer on 21st May 1973, a saving of 0-5 million has been assumed in 1974-75 in current expenditure on fire services. It is unlikely that fire services recruitment will fall short of the assump-tions made in the forecasts; but it is assumed that ina general atmosphere of financial restraint savings of this order will be made in current expenditure on goods and services.t In 1974-75  0-6 million has been deducted fromthe previous figures for capital expenditure as partof the total savings announced by the Chancellorof the Exchequer on 21st May 1973.scotland22. Expenditure is expected to increase by 13-8 percent over the periodl The estimates assume anaverage annual increase of about 75 whole-timefiremen. (With regard to the 1974-75 estimate, seethe note under Police, paragraph 5.)Other services england and wales23. As in previous Surveys the bulk of theexpenditure is in respect of grants to statutory or voluntary bodies. The estimates show an increaseof 12-4 per cent over the period. They include 2-8 million in 1973-74 and  0-3 million in 1974-75 for the completion of the work of the UgandaResettlement Board. The distorting effect of this expenditure causes a decrease in the estimates in1974-75.24. The main factors in the increase are:Urban Programme. The estimates for 1973-74and 1974-75 include  1-7 million in respect ofdelays in the completion of capital expenditure on regional infrastructure. Excluding this sum it isestimated that expenditure will rise from  13-1 million in 1973-74 to  16-9 million in 1977-78which is consistent with Cmnd. 5178.Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. after deducting the contribution from the Scottish Homeand Health Department the net expenditure isexpected to rise from  3-9 million in 1973-74 to 6-2 million in 1977-78. The estimates are basedon an intake of 12,350 cases in 1973-74 rising to17,450 in 1976-77 and 19,500 in 1977-78 comparedwith 11,790 in 1973-74 rising to 15,255 in 1976-77in Cmnd. 5178.scotland25. This includes provision for the urban programme which, if the element of  0 - 4 million forthe infrastructure programme is excluded, isestimated to rise from  1-3 million in 1973-74 to 1-9 million in 1977-78 and for contributions tothe Home Office in respect of the Scottish share of criminal Injuries Compensation Board expenditure which is expected to rise from  1-0 million in1973-74 to  1-6 million in 1977-78.Comparison with Cmnd. 5178england and wales26.

The programme covers expenditure on bothhigher and lower courts in Great Britain as well asthe costs incurred by departments concerned withthe administration of justice.29. The main factor determining the level ofexpenditure is the work load of the courts, butfollowing the passing of the Courts Act 1971capital expenditure is expected to increasesubstantially from 1972-73 onwards because of theneed to meet the accepted policy of concentratingthe business of the courts in fewer centres and to remedy inadequacies in existing facilities.england and wales30. Magistrates&apos; courts and other lower courtsaccount for more than half the total expenditure onlaw courts in England and Wales, and most of thisrelates to the cost of running these courts. Theestimates exceed those in Cmnd. 5178 revalued byabout  2 million a year. This is mainly becauselast year following the Courts Act 1971 the centralGovernment took over from local authoritiesresponsibility for the payment from public funds of costs awarded by magistrates and crown courts andthere was then insufficient information on which to base reliable projections. The estimates also showexpenditure increasing by about 30 per cent overthe Survey period due to a continuing increasein the volume of work. The figures also reflect theneed to replace some existing court buildings taken over for use as higher courts.31. The estimates cover expenditure on the highercourts including the new Crown Court and theCounty Courts.32. On 1st January 1972, as a result of the courts act 1971, Assizes and Quarter Sessions (which hadbeen the responsibility of local authorities) werereplaced by the Crown Court (for which the centralGovernment is responsible).33. This radical reorganisation envisaged proposalsfor increased capital expenditure on a centralisedcourt building programme in order to remedy the deficiencies in the existing provision of highercourts. Unfortunately, there is no experiencewithin central Government on which estimates forsuch a programme can be based. The PropertyServices Agency now maintain.that the programmeof courts envisaged in Cmnd. 5178 will cost almost50 per cent more during the period 1973-74 to1976-77 than estimated in Cmnd. 5178 revalued.The Treasury&apos;s view is that an increase of that ordercannot be accepted without the most stringentreview of all the assumptions underlying theestimates. For the purpose of this Report,therefore, the estimates are, after carrying forward the underspend from 1972-73, the same as in Cmnd.5178 revalued with an additional  1-9 million forschemes specifically approved by the Treasury.34. The counter inflationimpolicy combined with acertain over-optimism in Cmnd. 5178 hasnecessitated a reduction of  2 to  3 million a year in the level of fees and charges designed to cover the cost of civil business. The deficit on the directcost of civil business is estimated to be of the orderof  1 million a year,! but would be considerably higher if account were taken of the cost of allied services. iiscotland35. From 1st April 1973, the provision andmaintenance of Sheriff Court Houses became theresponsibility of the central Government; they wereformerly a local authority responsibility. CentralGovernment also assumes responsibility for administering the Lay Summary Courts in April1975 when the Burgh Courts cease to function as provided in the Local Government (Scotland) bill now before Parliament. The increase in centralGovernment current expenditure on these accountshas been reassessed and is now estimated to be only partly offset by a reduction in capitalexpenditure. Over the period as a whole an extra 1-5 million is required compared with Cmrid. 5178revalued.Reservations by the Lord Chancellors Office36. The Government has accepted the recom-mendation of the Royal Commission on Assizes andQuarter Sessions that, as part of his overallresponsibility for the running of the courts, the LordChancellor should accept the obligation of ensuring that new courts are built and maintained to satisfactory standards by the central Governmentwherever they are needed (Report, paragraph 335).37. The building programme of the lord chancellor&apos;s Office is based upon statistical forecasts of the need for future courtroom accommodation,which take into account the rate of growth of crime,current disposal rates and population trends. the validity of earlier forecasts has been greatlyreinforced since the 1972 Review by the most recentCONFIDENTIAL67
statistical projections. However, after taking account of developing design criteria, it is theopinion of the Property Services Agency that the requirement cannot be met without increased provision as follows:	1973	1974	1975	1976	7977	-74	-75	-76	-77	-781973 Report (Higher Courts					and Judges&apos; Lodgings)  .	7-6	7 0	9-1	12-5	12-5PSA estimate .      .      .	7-6	8-8	13-4	16-8	15-5(all figures exclude acquisitions of local authority property).38. Jn the opinion of the Lord Chancellors Officeit would have the most serious effect upon the ability of the courts to fulfil their task if the requirement were not met.Legal aid39. The estimates cover expenditure on theprovision of legal aid, advice and assistance for those of small or moderate means, and are basedon estimates of demand for the service. There isno scope for reducing the level of expenditurewithout either a reduction in the scope of the legal aid Scheme, which could not be achieved without legislation, or a change in the policy of partialannual uprating.40. The figures for legal aid in Great Britainassume that the number of both civil and criminal cases in which legal aid is granted will continue torise. Apart from this, the other main reasons for therise in expenditure over the years covered by thepresent Survey, are the introduction in 1973-74 ofa new Scheme for legal advice and assistance whichis expected to cost  1-9 million in the first year of operation rising to  2-7 million by 1977-78; andthe addition of VAT to solicitors&apos; charges from1973-74 onwards which it is estimated will cost 2-2 million in 1973-74 rising to  2-6 million by1977-78.41. The figures show a decrease, when comparedwith Cmnd. 5178 revalued, of  5-1 million over theperiod 1973-74 to 1976-77, and this is primarilyattributable to reductions in the estimates of thecost of administration and of payments to solicitorsand counsel arising from a decrease in the estimated number of legal aid certificates to be issued formatrimonial causes and in magistrates&apos; courts.Reservations by the Lord Chancellors Office42. Entitlement to legal aid, in part or in whole,is determined by reference to a scale of disposableincome, available to an individual and his dependants, after taking into account variousallowances. Present policy continues as in the pastto be based on annual uprating of the allowances(in  line  with  supplementary  benefit)  but  onlyoccasional uprating of the disposable income limitsat the discretion of Ministers, and the forecastsassume that there will be no uprating of disposableincome limits in the five years covered by the survey. In this respect legal aid is treated lessfavourably than other means-tested social benefits,especially supplementary benefit, to which, in theview of the Lord Chancellors Office, legal aid oughtto be linked. The Lord Chancellors Office therefore consider that the disposable income limits for legal aid should be uprated as soon as possible to restore the relativity to supplementary benefit as at thelast legal aid uprating in 1970, and that annualuprating in line with supplementary benefit shouldbe the rule thereafter. To restore the limits to the1970 level would add an estimated  2-5 million ina full year and annual upratings would each addabout  1 million a year to the cost of theprogramme. On the assumption that the firstuprating was effective from April 1974 the additional cost would be  2-5 million in 1974-75 rising to 5-5 million in 1977-78.MODIFIED INTERPRETATION OFEXISTING POLICYPolice, England and Wales43. A saving in capital expenditure on forensicscience laboratories might be made without anovert breach of existing policy by rephasingcommencing dates and delaying the replacement of unsatisfactory accommodation.   The figures are:  million1975-76	1976-77	1977-780-1	0-2	0-2Prisons, Scotland44. To achieve a worthwhile reduction it wouldbe necessary to defer by one year one of the two major building schemes due to commence in the survey period and thus lengthen the time that over-crowding will persist in obsolete prisons.45. The deferment mentioned above would resultin the following reductions:  million	1976-77	1977-78	0-9	1-0Higher	courts	46.   If	Ministers   wished	to   exercise   greaterstringency in this programme the  1-9 millionaddition mentioned in paragraph 33 could probablybe contained with the Cmnd. 5178 totals at theexpense of some postponements in both sitepurchases and building.
ALTERNATIVE POLICY IMPLICATIONSEngland and Walesprisons47. (i). Current policy, as announced toParliament, and in the public expenditure white paper, is to achieve a level of starts of new prisonplaces averaging 3,000 a year. The prison building programme had come virtually to a halt at the endof the 1960s and considerable effort has gone intobuilding up the rate of starts in accordance withthe Government^ election pledge to restore the prison building programme.(ii). A reduction of  3 million has already beenmade to the building programme in 1974-75 follow-ing the recent Government cuts in public spending.This had the effect of deferring work on four major schemes and the provision of staff quarters at a fifth.To achieve further economies would mean reducingthe level of starts to about 2,400 in both 1974-75and 1975-76. To achieve such a reduction wouldinvolve, as one possibility, abandoning one of theschemes on which work has now been deferred anda second project now under negotiation with thelocal authority, and deferring work on a further sixschemes by one or two years. Such a change ofpolicy would achieve the economies shown in the table below totalling  7-6 million over the survey period in addition to the reduction of  3 millionalready made.(iii). The loss of 1,000 places and the defermentof another 2,000 would inevitably affect the levelof overcrowding in obsolete Victorian prisons both at the end of the Survey period and in the rest ofthe decade. It would delay the time when there wasa reasonable balance between the prison population(on the basis of current prison population project-tions) and the &quot; uncrowded &quot; capacity of the system;and would still further delay the replacement ofthe old Victorian prisons.(iv). Planning clearances now have time limits, andany deferment of a scheme can put the clearanceat risk. More important, perhaps, it would becomemuch more difficult to sustain a case at a public inquiry for the new prisons which are still badly needed, particularly in the North-West of England,if it were known that planning clearances alreadyobtained in other parts of the country were not beingutilised.(v). Besides these general arguments a further cut in prisons capital would cause difficulty on individualschemes. For example,&apos; the measures involved would include the abandonment of a young offenderestablishment at West Mailing in Kent, for which planning clearance was obtained only after a public inquiry and where pressure was put on the UgandaResettlement Board to vacate the camp. Similarly,there has been a recent public inquiry concerningtwo prisons in the East Riding and it would castdoubt on the case made at that inquiry for the urgency of the prisons if one of them were nowdeferred.Total capital expenditure  million	1973	1974	1975	1976	1977	Total	-74	-75	-76	-77	-78	1973 Survey .	25-5	29-6	38-8	41-2	44-8	179-9Alternative costing	25-5	28-8	37-3	37-9	42-8	172-3Saving .	-	0-8	1-5	3-3	20	7-6

The purpose of grants for the arts and the craftsis to encourage, by means of subsidy or guarantee,performances, exhibitions and works of qualitywhich would not otherwise be possible and therebyincrease the understanding, practice and accessibilityof the arts and crafts. In general such grantsrepresent less than half of the total cost, and inmost cases under a third. Apart from the box-office, they are supplemented by grants from privatecharitable sources, local authorities, individualpatrons of the arts and, in the case of the film, from industry. The range of support includes music,opera, ballet, drama, pictorial arts, sculpture,literature, the art of the film and sound recording.2. The national museums and galleries are almost wholly financed from public funds, but each to various degrees draws support from bequests andother funds, and benefits from sales of services,publications, reproduction rights and the like. the range of the national museums includes the wholeof art and antiquities together with representativehistorical, technological and scientific fields. Themuseums play an important part in school, univer-sity and adult education, research and recreation.Coverage3. The programme includes expenditure on local aswell as on national museums and galleries thoughdirect control is restricted to voted provisions.Other local expenditure is determined by localauthorities. Expenditure on the British Museum,but not the British Library, is included. Expenditureon minor capital works, furniture and maintenanceof the premises of the national museums and galleries is attributed to the Arts programme forthe first time. The totals are in line with Cmnd.5178 revalued.Museums and Galleries4. Provision for current expenditure is made onthe basis of the known development plans of the institutions and on the building programmes already under way. It allows for the maintenance of and additions to the collections. The provisions assume that the introduction of admission charges will raise in a full year  750,000 net from the Englishinstitutions, but a decision on when the chargeswill be introduced has still to be taken. It isestimated that a further  100,000 will be raised
from the Scottish and Welsh institutions and anadditional  100,000 from the British Museum(Natural History) and the Geological Museum,provision for which is made in other programmes.5. The extent of the capital programme has yet to be determined. A provisional programme hasbeen prepared and submitted indicating what canbe achieved within the resources outlined in theWhite Paper on Future Policy for Museums and galleries (Cmnd. 4676). The nature of the pro-gramme is such that it can be controlled in practiceonly by the manipulation of major schemes.Provision is based on the figures in Cmnd. 4676appropriately rephased and revalued, but account has been taken of the policy decision to delay until after 1974-75 the start of one major scheme, whichwill be redesigned (the British Museum AmenitiesBlock). The reduction in the programme will be 1-0 million in 1974-75, with some consequentialreduction in 1973-74.National Theatre6. The additional Government contribution to theNational Theatre referred to in Cmnd. 5178 as being subject to the passing of the National Theatre andMuseum of London Bill has been authorised andthe total Government commitment to the Theatre,therefore, is now  5-7 million: the GLCcommitment is  4-7 million.Arts Council and grants to the arts7. Provision for the arts has been made, on thebasis of present policy, for a 10 per cent increasea year in real terms, as in Cmnd. 5178. TheTreasury has asked that the policy of a 10 per centgrowth rate should be examined with a view tosavings in the later part of the planning period.This is referred to again in paragraph 9 below.Provision for the crafts has been made from within this total, and additional resources for assistanceto local museums, as recommended in the Committeeon Provincial Museums and Galleries Report, wouldhave to be found from the same source.8. Apart from direct grants made to organisationsin the regions, grants to Regional Arts associations and to the Welsh and Scottish Arts Councils haveincreased from  1-8 million in 1970-71 to a proposed  4-1 million in 1973-74. The arts council estimates that some two thirds of the totalgrant is now spent outside London.ALTERNATIVE LOWER COSTINGSGrowth rate for the arts9. As part of a general policy to encourage longer-term financial planning by the Arts Council, theCouncil has been given an indication of the imaximum figure of its jgrant for 1974-75 and1975-76. While no indications have been given for1976-77 and 1977-78, // the adoption without adequate notice of a smaller annual increment would produce a hiatus in planning which could lead to the accumulation of deficits by some of the arts council&apos;s larger clients as has happened in the past.Furthermore it is established policy to add a newregional dimension to the Arts Council activitieswithout cutting down on the support for metro-politan art and the amount of the grant spent in the regions has increased rapidly.10. The Department considers that any change incurrent policies, if made necessary on general financial grounds, should apply to the years 1976-77and 1977-78, but should also be based on analternative long-term plan for arts finance. TheDepartment accepts that a 10 per cent growth rateresults in a geometric growth leading to a doublingof finance every 1\ years, and that this cannot con-tinue indefinitely. At the same time for the reasonsoutlined above a sudden change to a lower per-centage growth rate more in line with the movementof national resources would cause difficulty. Analternative lower costing could be that the actualincrement in 1975-76 should be continued for subse-quent years producing a saving of  0-3 million in1976-77 and  0-8 million in 1977-78. (By 1979-80the saving would be over  3 million.)

The estimates have been based on a continuation of existing policies including those announced in cmnd. 5174 and Cmnd. 5175 which followed the1972 PAR study on Higher Education and SchoolsExpenditure and the James Report on teacher training. The expenditure consequences of these policies were reflected in Cmnd. 5178. The aim ofthe expenditure continues to be to make provision,both capital and current, for the numbers of pupilsand students expected to attend schools and colleges.The main reasons for the rising expenditure includethe continuing improvements in teacher/pupil ratiosin schools, and growth in numbers expected to enterhigher education, and the extension of provision for children under five.2. The forecast is that between 1973-74 and1977-78 expenditure (Great Britain) will rise by 657 million or 3 - 9 per cent a year.3. Manpower engaged in the education service(excluding universities) is expected to increase byabout 3-6 per cent a year over the period from943,000 in April 1973 to 1,125,000 in April 1978.ENGLAND (including post-school education in wales and University Grants Committeeexpenditure in Scotland)4.

Thefigures include estimates of students expected to be followingcourses, other than courses of teacher training, in colleges of education.(3) Estimated for the academic year commencing in the relevant financial year. Includes students (together with thefull-time equivalent of part-time students) following courses of in-service training and induction training as well as courses of initial teacher training.
5. The estimate of local authority current expendi-ture for 1973-74 is determined by the rate support grant settlement for that year. Annex D ofthe Main Report raises the question whether the savings in public expenditure in 1974-75 announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 21st Mayshould affect 1974-75 only or whether they should form a new lower base for expenditure projectionsin subsequent years. The only saving in theeducation and libraries block which is affected bythis question is the share of the reductions in localauthority recurrent expenditure attributed for PESCpurposes to this programme, i.e.  22 -1 million for england and Wales. If the reductions in the 1974-75figures were projected into the forecasts for later years, the savings would be as follows:  million1975-76	1976-77	1977-7822-3	23-3	24-1(Excluding expenditure by Welsh Office on schools.)Since the response by authorities to the Chancellorsstatement cannot be centrally predicted or controlledin detail, the  22 -1 million reduction has, for PESCpurposes, been arbitrarily distributed among themore important heads of the programme. Inpractice it is likely that authorities will decide tomeet the Chancellor^ requirements in 1974-75 bydeferring maintenance and by other temporaryexpedients. Such deferment could not be long con-tinued and would need to be made up subsequently.So the savings shown above would accordingly, inthe Department^ view, entail a real lowering of standards. This would probably fall in the area ofnon-teaching costs, particularly books, equipment and other aids to learning but might also affectauthorities&apos; willingness to employ teachers. both these consequences would arouse public criticism andbe difficult to reconcile with the Education white paper.6. On 1st April 1973 building cost limits forschools, further education and colleges of educationwere raised by 22 per cent on account of pay and price increases. The cost limits for universitybuilding were increased by a similar amount fromthe same date but of the increase 5 per cent wasclassed as a real addition to the programme, thebalance being on account of pay and price increases.7. The forecasts of capital expenditure provide for building starts as follows:  million	1973	1974	1975	1976	1977	-74	-75	-76	-77	-78Schools  .	220-4	231-5	223-9	215-3	216-3Further Education   .	51-9	63-0	92-5	92-5	90-9Teacher Training	4-2	4-2	4-2	4-2	4-2Universities	32-0	30-6	52-1	67-7	53-7	308-5	329-3	372-7	379-7	365-1Youth Service and Local Libraries cannot be costedon the basis of starts programmes controlled by theDepartment and are therefore omitted from this table.schools (england)8. As the table in paragraph 4 shows the number of teachers is expected to rise from 403,000 in 1974 to462,000 in 1978. This growth represents a movement towards the target for England and Wales of 510,000(full-time equivalent) qualified teachers set out in cmnd. 5174.9. The estimates of current expenditure are mainlyrelated to the teacher and pupil numbers and allow,mainly from 1975-76, for the increased provision for children under five announced in Cmnd. 5174. they also provide improvement factors in non-teachingcosts of 3 per cent in 1973-74 and in subsequent years.10. The method for calculating expenditure on school transport in past years has provedunsatisfactory in the light of actual expenditure onthis item; estimates have been significantly lower than expenditure. To remedy this situation a newformula taken into use in connection with the1973-74 rate support grant negotiations has been used for the present Survey period. The new method accounts in 1976-77 for  7-1 million of thechange from Cmnd. 5178 revalued recorded in the table in paragraph 22.11. The building programme starts not only take account of the changes in the school population butalso continue to provide for the replacement and improvement of old primary schools (at new costlimits  61-7 million in 1973-74 and 1974-75 and 64-8 million in each of the subsequent years) and,from 1975-76, of old secondary schools also (at 11-3 million in 1975-76 and 1976-77 and  22-million in the following year). The starts from1974-75 to 1976-77 include  17-2 million in eachyear for provision for children under five and rising to  22-9 million in 1977-78.12. In the light of the recent Ministerial decisionto defer the increase to 14p in the charge for school meals, originally due to take effect from 1st April1973, the forecasts are costed on the basis of a 12pcharge throughout the Survey period.13. The estimates reflect the acceleration of thespecial school building programme announced in cmnd. 5174 with starts (at new cost limits) asfollows:.   million1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-7815-1	17-9	21-6	23-3	23-3CONFIDENTIAL75
further education (england and wales)14. The current estimates are based on the studentnumbers (full-time equivalents) set out in the table in paragraph 4. Account is taken from 1974-75onwards of net annual savings of  5&apos;7 million inconsequence of an increase in fees for further education courses which are assumed to take effect from the commencement of the academic year 1974-75. As regards advanced further education, theWhite Paper (Cmnd. 5174) set out the framework for the further pattern of growth. In the absenceof any comparable policy for regulating the scale of development of the remainder of further education, the establishment of courses in this sector and the scale of provision made by localeducation authorities generally reflect their individual response to the needs and demands theyidentify.15. The Departments original proposal for building programme starts in 1976-77 was  99*7 million but this figure was reduced in discussionwith the Treasury to the level of the preceding year ( 92-5 million) pending the outcome both ofthe current Further Education AccommodationSurvey and of the review of higher education which local authorities have been asked to undertake in response to the Departments Circular 7/73 on theDevelopment of Higher Education in the Non-University sector. The results of both enquiriesshould enable a further assessment to be made ofthe additional places required in the non-advancedsector and also those necessary to fulfil the policy on higher education announced in Cmnd. 5174.teacher training (england and wales)16. The table in paragraph 4 reflects the policiesannounced in Cmnd. 5174 for a reduction in thenumber of students following courses of initial training and for the expansion of in-service training and the introduction of induction training for new entrants to the profession. The number of full-timestudents on courses of initial training in colleges ofeducation is expected to fall from 112-8 thousandin 1973-74 to 78-5 thousand in 1977-78.universities (great britain)17. The forecasts of student numbers and the related expenditure reflect the quinquennialsettlement for 1972-77 announced in Cmnd. 5174.An adjustment has been made to recurrent grants and student awards to reflect an assumed increasein fees from the academic year 1974-75.18. The Department considers that the cost of acquiring properties adjacent to the Royal college of Art (District Valuer&apos;s 1972 valuation  0-9million) should be added to the estimate for 1974-75. It is understood that these properties, whichare likely to be required in the near future, will shortly come on to the market and if not purchasedwhen available may be permanently denied to the college.19. As a result of the Governmenfs rejection ofthe Computer Board&apos;s proposal to install an IBMcomputer at Glasgow University, continued use ofthe rented IBM computer at Edinburgh Universitywill be necessary pending installation of a newlarge computer at Edinburgh to provide a regionalservice for the Scottish Universities. Provision of 0-2 million is therefore made in each of the years1974-75 and 1975-76 for the continuing rental.youth service and local libraries20. Apart from capital grants to voluntary youthand community projects these programmes are nolonger controlled by the Department; they have since April 1971 come within the locally determinedsector of the local authority capital programmes.The figures represent a continuation in 1977-78 ofthe levels agreed in Cmnd. 5178 up to 1976-77revalued to 1973 Survey prices.british library21.

These differences result from both policy andestimating changes.

Also reflected in the forecasts is the acceleration of the specialschool building programme with starts as follows:  million1973-74    1974-75    1975-76    1976-77    1977-780-7 1-0 1-1 1-2 1-227. As in England the estimate of local authoritycurrent expenditure for 1973-74 is determined bythe rate support grant settlement for that year andthe expenditure for subsequent years is projectedonward by reference mainly to the number of pupilsand teachers. The numbers of pupils and teachers in Wales are expected to show similar trends tothose in England and take account, mainly from1975-76, of the increased provision for children under five. The 1974-75 forecast has been reducedby  1-0 million following the reductions announced in local authority current expenditure. If this reduction is projected into subsequent years savings would result as follows:  million1975-76		1976-77	1977-781-0		1-0	1-1The  implications	of	these	reductions  on  theprogramme would	be	similar	to those set out inparagraph 5.28. Charges for school meals have been costed at12p throughout the Survey period.These increases result from both policy andestimating changes. The policy changes follow from the decision to defer the planned 2p increasein the charge for school meals and the mainestimating changes result from higher capitalexpenditure on the school building programme, andan increase in pupil and/teacher numbers.ISCOTLAND  (excluding  university  grants  com-mittee expenditure on universities)30.

The reductions of  2-8 million in localauthority current expenditure for 1974-75-reflecting the Chancellor&apos;s announcement of 21stMay are notional, being subject to the outcome of discussions with the local authorities in the coming months about the distribution of the savings amongservices. If the reductions in the 1974-75 figures were projected into the forecasts for later years, the savings would be as follows:  million1975-76	1976-77	1977-782-9	3-0	3-1The likely main changes resulting from thesesavings would be that the number of teachers whomauthorities would be able to recruit would be
insufficient to permit the achievement of the targets for staffing standards in primary and in secondary schools by 1975-76 and 1977-78 respectively asnoted in paragraph 33. In each case there wouldbe. a delay of one year. Authorities would also require to slow down maintenance programmes and improvements in the supply of books.32.

Forecasts of current expenditure are related tothe increase in pupil and teacher numbers set outin the table above. The number of teachers avail-able is expected to be sufficient to allow theannounced staffing standards in primary schoolsrepresented by a pupil-teacher ratio of 25:1 to beachieved by 1975-76 and the proposed staffingstandards in secondary schools represented by apupil-teacher ratio of 15:1 to be achieved by1977-78.34. The school building programme makes provision for new places mainly caused by the shift of population and the increasing secondary school population, with particular reference to the accom-modation required in primary schools for the improved staffing standards and for the developmentof nursery education announced in the White Paper&quot; Education in Scotland: A Statement of Policy &quot;(Cmnd. 5175).further education35.

Forecasts of the number of students over theperiod reflect the intended stabilisation of staffingstandards in primary schools from about 1975-76.other services37. Expenditure on meals and milk which takes account of the deferment of the proposed increase incharge from 12p to 14p from 1st April 1973 isestimated to rise from  15 million in 1973-74 to 16-5 million in 1977-78. These figures have been adjusted to reflect the expected purchasing power ofthe cash value of the charges. Forecasts for univer-sity awards make provision for the expected growth in the number of Scottish students qualifying forawards (from 27,643 in 1972-73 to 38,900 in1977-78). This item also includes expenditure on social and recreational education and the libraryservice.38. Additional provision is included for expenditureon leisure facilities of  0-5 million in 1974-75. Butthe Department consider that a further  0 - 5 million is required in 1975-76 as part of the North Sea oilinfrastructure requirements.comparison with cmnd. 5178 (scotland)39.

These increases are partly offset by otherestimating changes.COSTED VARIANTS41.

42. The possibility of savings in the areas of localauthority current expenditure which have not been referred to above (notably non-teaching costs in schools and further education and expenditure on the youth service and local libraries) would have to beconsidered further in the light of the government&apos;s policy towards local authorities&apos; current expendituregenerally.43. The Education Departments consider that the implications for different parts of the education programme of the items listed in the precedingTables would be as follows.ENGLAND AND WALES (and universities inScotland)general44. Where existing policies simply represent the continuation of some well-established practice orpattern of provision, e.g. the continuation of a standard rate of growth, modifications may bepossible without arousing a great deal of public criticism. But when, as for the great bulk ofeducation expenditure, existing policies have only recently been authoritatively defined and explained in a White Paper (Cmnd. 5174), any subsequentmodifications are likely, to arouse much strongercriticism than would otherwise be the case, even when they do not amount to the abandonment ofa specific pledge but only to the disappointment of reasonable expectations generated by the white paper. At the least such modifications would beseen as bad management, taking place so soon after the publication of the White Paper; theywould also reinforce the criticisms of those whoregard the proposals as inadequate and doubt theGovernments intention of carrying them through.nursery education45. To reduce the total nursery building pro-gramme by as much as one-third from 1974-75onwards (Table (ii) (a) (1)) would amount to a virtual abandonment by the Government of thescale of expansion proposed in the White Paper,not simply its timing.improvement     programme     for     primary    and secondary schools46. To impose a cut of as much as one-quarter inthe plans for improvement of primary and secondary schools (Table (ii) (c) (ri)) would leave no room for a rising secondary programme and would also require a substantial cut-back in the programme for primary schools. While there is no public commit-ment about the level of this programme in 1977-78,Table 19 provides for a continuation in that year ofthe existing level, and this will be the general publicexpectation.&quot; slippage &quot; of 1972-73 building programmes(Table (ii) (b), (d), (f) and (m))47. A refusal to increase the 1973-74 startsprogramme to compensate for &quot; slippage&quot; from1972-73, as is the normal practice, could be operated administratively for the local authoritybuilding programmes with little risk of criticism.But it would have to be made known to the universities, and would probably arouse strong criticism.university equipment grant supplementation(Table (i) (c).and Table (ii) (g))48. Supplementation is the addition normally madeeach year to university grants to compensate forrising prices as ascertained by the application of an agreed index. To withhold all supplementation due on account of 1973-74 price increases (Table (ii)(g)) would be regarded by the universities as undulyharsh and in breach of a Government undertaking,unless it was declared publicly that &quot; exceptionaldifficulties &quot; existed.slowing   down   of   introduction  of  in-servicetraining49. While some slowing down from the rate of growth provided for in Table 19 might occur if local authorities were left to manage things for themselves, there will be strong pressure on theDepartment, particularly from the teachers&apos; unions,to maintain an acceptable rate of progress (Table(ii) (/))-universities:     supplementation    of    recurrentgrant50. As the present quinquennial settlement was astringent one, the withholding of even 12  per cent of supplementation for the 1973-74 price increase(Table (i) (e)) would be resented by the universities.The withholding of all supplementation for 1973-74(Table (ii) (k)) would create very severe problems for the universities and would lead to widespreadcriticism of the Government as being a breach ofan existing undertaking, unless the Governmentdeclared that &quot; exceptional difficulties &quot; existed.SCOTLAND51. Difficulties would arise in Scotland from a departure from the White Paper &quot; Education inScotland: A Statement of Policy&quot; (Cmnd. 5175).There would be particular criticism of a reductionin the nursery school programme: and the reductions in other capital programmes would be unlikely to escape adverse comment given thenature of the commitments entered into or implied by the White Paper.CONFIDENTIAL81

Provision for the Scottish central services is included under Other central services and grants.1. The coverage remains similar to that in Cmnd.5178. The main changes in classification have beenthe transfer of responsibility for supporting certain categories of students training for social work andfor the cost of certain courses to the education andlibraries programme, and the transfers to the health and personal social services programme ofcertain health treatment expenditures arising fromentry into the e.c., and of provision forconcessionary fares made by local authorities,previously counted as miscellaneous local services.2. For the years to 1976-77 the figures in Cmnd.5178 have been revalued. The main policy change is i the decision to expand family planning services under the National Health Service. This was referred to in Cmnd. 5178, but the figures in theWhite Paper were not amended at the time to take account of the change.   The cost has now beenprovided for in the table, which incorporates atotal provision for family planning services in 1976-77 of about  30 million. This figure takes accountof the further policy decision that contraceptives,including the pill, should be made available underthe standard National Health Service chargingarrangements, which limit the charge for the pill tothe flat-rate prescription charge. It is estimatedthat this decision on charging will lead to a more rapid expansion of the service as well as to asubstantial reduction in the yield from charges.The extra cost is estimated to rise to a peak of nearly  17 million in 1976-77, with some reductionin subsequent years. A decision has been deferredon how this extra cost should be met. A furtherpolicy change results from the Chancellorsstatement on 21st May on public expenditurereductions. The figures for local authority current expenditure on the personal social services haveCONFIDENTIAL83
been reduced, in 1974-75 only, by  4-3 million inEngland, by  0-2 million in Wales and by  0-million in Scotland. It should be noted that theScottish element of the reduction for 1974-75 isparticularly provisional and subject to the outcome of discussions with the local authorities in thecoming months about the distribution of the savingsamong the services. The question of reductions in subsequent years is discussed in Annex D ofPart I. If the growth rates provided for in Table20 were applied to the lower baseline the reductions in subsequent years would be:  million1975-76	1976-77	1977-785-5	60	6-6The main burden of these further reductions wouldbe likely to fall on the preventive and domiciliaryservices, since a large share of the annual growth rate is pre-empted by the consequences of capitalworks.3. The main estimating changes arise in the family practitioner services ( 5-8 million in the first year of the quinquennium,  7-0 million in the second, 9-6 million in the third, and  11-4 million in thefourth see paragraph 16 below) and from areassessed apportionment of administration costsbetween the Social security and Health and personal social services programmes.4.

There is broad agreement between theDepartments and the Treasury on the figures in the table, with one important exception current expenditure on local authority health services inEngland and Wales. The figures shown for Englandand Wales are those in Cmnd. 5178 revalued(amended to cover estimated additional expenditureon family planning). The White Paper figuresreflected the result of the rate support grant negotiations for 1973-74 but did not carry forward the consequences of this settlement to subsequent years. The result was that the average annualgrowth rate for England and Wales between 1971-72 and 1976-77 was 2-6 per cent. In Scotland therate support grant negotiations were still in progresswhen Cmnd. 5178 was published and the outcome of the settlement is reflected in the figures in the table.6. Local health services will be managed from1974-75 onwards by Area Health Authorities, inconjunction with hospital services which have forsome years been developing at the rate of Z\ percent a year. In the last two years of theirmanagement of local health services, localauthorities in England and Wales are expected to achieve development at the rate of 4 per cent a year.DHSS and Welsh Office thus regard it as of utmost importance that a service which is developing at about 4 per cent should not, when financial responsibility is transferred to the central Govern-ment, be required to slow down to 2-6 per cent.Any enhancement of this rate would clearly haveto be achieved at the expense of the hospital service;and if the rate is not enhanced, the effects are likelyto be felt first by the preventive and domiciliaryservices, such as health visiting, home nursing and family planning. But the first two of these services are used mainly by the elderly and the preliminaryconclusions of the PAR on the Elderly are that thegrowth rate of expenditure on them should beincreased.7. DHSS and Welsh Office therefore proposeforecasts for local health current expenditurereflecting growth at 3\ per cent a year. Theadditional expenditure would be as follows:  million	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78England	2-6	5-3	8-1	9-9Wales   .	0-2	0-4	0-6	0-7Manpower8. The manpower forecasts for the programme arein keeping with the developments foreshadowed in cmnd. 5178. The total manpower in this programme is planned to rise from 1,005,295 at thebeginning of 1973-74 to 1,183,274 at the end of1977-78. Over the period the total increase will beabout 18 per cent, but the increases in particular services will reflect the emphasis given to develop-ment of different parts of the service, and thelimitation on the numbers likely to be available.A growth over the period of 43 per cent is forecast for the personal social services compared with 13per cent and 12 per cent in the hospital and community health services respectively. Theincrease in general medical and dental practitionersis expected to be about 6-5 per cent a rate of increase which is much greater than the forecastgrowth in population over the period (2 per cent).PAR and the programme budget9. The PAR on the Elderly has been circulated to ministers. The report shows that just over 30 percent of recurrent public expenditure on the health

The programme is controlled as a blockbudget. The provision in the programme continuesbroadly at the same level as in Cmnd. 5178 except to the extent that for England and Wales deductionshave been made to help meet the cost of family planning. A redefinition of expenditure within thecapital category means that expenditure in Englandand Wales formerly falling on the current head nowhas to be accommodated in this programme (ineffect a reduction in total capital expenditure in real terms). In the absence of any availableadditional funds provision has had to be made within the programme for installation of electricalgenerating facilities for use in power failures. Allthese changes, reflecting the Governments decisions on priorities, lead to reductions in this programme by sums in excess of  15 million a year.14. The objectives of the programme are broadlyas set out in Cmnd. 5178, except for the recently announced decision that community hospitals inEngland and Wales will be associated, where appropriate, with general hospitals, as units in thedistrict hospital service. This decision was announced on the basis that no change in the overall financial provision was involved.  million1973-74        1974-75        1975-76        1976-77        1977-78EnglandBasic programme .....	195-3	191-3	187-7	186-3	186-1	-.&quot;     .              4-3 &apos;		&apos; ,..7&apos;2.^---.--.	-	.&apos;&apos; -1971 addition ( 118 million)   .	10-6	14-2	10-2		-Total     .      .      .      .      .	210-2	205-5	197-9	186-3	186-1WalesBasic programme .      .      .      .      .	9-9	9-7	10-8	11-3	11-3Regional infrastructure ....	1-1	-	 , ,.....		-&apos;1971 addition ( 118 million)   .	.      .              10	1-5	0-4		Total     .      .      .      .      .	120	11-2	11-2	11-3	11-3Scotland						. ^V-......        25-9	27-1	26-8	27-2	27-2Regional infrastructure ....	.                     0-5			2.--	 1971 addition ( 118 million)   .	.              2-4   ,	1-8	1-4	:&apos; - - &apos; -&apos;&quot; if	 Total     .      .      .      .      .	-.            28-8	28-9	28-2	27-2	27-2Total Great Britain .	251-0	245-6	237-3	224-8	224-60---------and personal social services is spent on services for people aged 65 and over, although they are only13 per cent of the population. The number ofelderly people is growing absolutely andproportionately, from just over 7 million to nearly8 million or 14 per cent by 1982; the number ofthose over 75, who are the heaviest users of services,will increase from 2\ million to 3 million over thesame period. This will throw a heavy burden onthe programme. The PAR report recommends agreater emphasis on domiciliary and day care.10. The DHSS is developing a programme budget in conjunction with Departmental work on a planning structure for the health and personal social services. This is based on a structure ofclient groups, such as the elderly, the mentally handicapped etc. It is not however proposed thatthis client group structure should be used for thefinancial control of the NHS authorities afterreorganisation in 1974. The authorities willcontinue to receive block allocations for their capital and current expenditure.11. It is planned that information on howexpenditure is related to client groups should beincluded in future public expenditure White Papers,to supplement the information on the amountsdevoted e.g. to hospital, family practitioner andlocal authority services.
hospital current expenditure15. This block budget covers advances to hospital authorities, and takes up more than half the totalexpenditure on the whole health and personal social services programme. Its objectives remain broadlyas set out in Cmnd. 5178 and the provision in1977-78 is based on a continuation of the 3  percent a year increase allowed for in that white paper. High priority will continue to be given to bringing standards of staffing and living conditions for long-stay patients the elderly and the mentally ill and handicapped up to a basic acceptablestandard. The redefinition of capital expenditure(see paragraph 13) will bring some relief to this programme.family practitioner services16. This heading covers the general medical, dentaland ophthalmic services and the pharmaceuticalservices. The figures are the best availableassessments of likely expenditure; they take accountof the latest forecasts of numbers of doctors and dentists; volume and costs of services, treatmentsand prescriptions; and policy on charges. The mainchange from Cmnd. 5178 revalued is the estimatedcost of the extension of family planning servicesthrough the family practitioner services, and of the associated charges (rising to  18 million a year).Minor changes include some further increase in theproportion of dental treatments provided without charge to patients in the priority classes; a decreasein the proportion of sight tests which give rise tothe supply of National Health Service glasses; andan increase in the number of prescriptions expectedto be dispensed. As a result of estimating changes the drug bill is expected to be more than  9 million higher in 1976-77 compared with Cmnd. 5178revalued. A reduction of  3  million a year in thedrug bill has been assumed from 1974-75 onwards,arising from the Governmenfs Order to bring down the price of Valium and Librium. This has beenclassified as a policy change.17. The forecasts for current expenditure assume that prescription charges will remain at the flat rate of 20p an item for most items; that dental and ophthalmic charges will be increased as costs rise;and that exemptions from charges in thepharmaceutical, dental and ophthalmic services willremain unchanged.18. Over the five-year period to 1978 it is estimatedthat the numbers of doctors will increase from24,965 to 26,470, a 6 per cent increase, and ofdentists from 12,420 to 13,370, an 8 per cent increase, and that the ratio of population to doctorswill go down by 4 per cent from about 2,180 to 1to about 2,100 to 1.local authority servicesCapital19. The greater part of capital expenditure on local authority health and personal social services is controlled centrally under &quot; key sector&quot;arrangements in England and Wales, and throughborrowing consents in Scotland. The objectivesremain broadly as set out in Cmnd. 5178.The relevant financial provisions in Cmnd. 5178have been taken as the basis of existing policy.The three-year building programmes, submitted bylocal authorities in England and Wales in October1972, show that the level of investment theycontemplate is substantially higher than theprovision made in the programme for these years.There is a similar indication in the ten-year plansfrom local authorities in England and Wales so farexamined and the six-year plans so far receivedfrom Scottish local authorities. The Departments&apos;experience has been that local authorities&apos; buildingforecasts are optimistic and need to be writtendown. Nevertheless, the figures in the table for1974-75 have necessitated reductions in these fore-casts which the Departments themselves wouldhave wished to avoid, because the Cmnd. 5178provisions do not enable the local authorities togive as high a priority to these services as theDepartments would have considered appropriate if more resources had been available.local authority servicesCurrent20. The forecasts reflect the 1972 rate support grant settlement for 1973-74 (1973-74 and 1974-75for Scotland), subject to what has already been said in paragraph 5 about the local health figures for england and Wales, and to the adjustments madeas a result of the Chancellors statement on short-term reductions (see paragraph 2 above). Theprojection for the new year 1977-78 provides for growth in the personal social services at 8-5 percent on 1976-77 in accordance with the underlyingtrend referred to in Cmnd. 5178, before the additionof  8-9 million a year to the totals to take accountof the transfer of expenditure on concessionaryfares by local authorities (paragraph 1 above).Expenditure on personal social services willcontinue to be the responsibility of local authorities,and its level will be dependent inter alia on thefuture rate support grant settlements.ALTERNATIVE POLICY IMPLICATIONS21. The following paragraphs set out the implications-tions of reducing expenditure in order to build up a true contingency reserve as required by Ministers. Intabular form the adjustments resulting from the changes of policy listed below would be:

The implications for different parts of theprogramme of these illustrative reductions would inthe view of the Departments be as follows.hospital current23. A large part of this provision is pre-emptedas a result of capital developments. When these have been met, little more than 1 per cent (about 14jr million in 1973-74) out of the annual 3J percent growth is left to cover pressures from theageing population and the use of new drugs and medical techniques, as well as improvements in standards outside the area covered by the new building programme. The consequences of reduc-tions of   per cent or \ per cent in the growth ratefrom 1975-76 would most likely be one or a combination of the following, depending on the degree of the saving and the priorities chosen to implement it:(a) Delay in commissioning or making full use ofsome of the new buildings becoming available.(b) Delay in improving conditions in long-stayhospitals.(c) Delay  in  other  developments  except theinescapable growth of expenditure on drugs,new medical treatments, etc.The adjustments to expenditure would be of thefollowing order:  million1975-761976-771977-78a.b.-4-3-8-5-8-8-17-6-13-7-27-3hospital capital24. This element has effectively been reducedalready in order to contribute towards the cost of family planning, to cover expenditure previouslydefined as &quot; current&quot; and to meet, urgently, the costof providing generators in hospitals for emergencypower supply.25. Assuming a reduction in 1977-78 of  10 million the build-up would probably be as follows:i   million1975-76	1976-77	1977-78-30	-60	-100Cuts of this order would have to be announced; andthe DHSS does not think that it could avoid post-postponing the rebuilding of Broadmoor due to begin in1976-77. Other schemes would have to be deferred.local  authority   health   and  personal   social services capital26] The consequences of an assumed reduction of 8 million have been examined. The build-up wouldprobably be as follows:  million1975-76	1976-77	1977-78-20	-5-0	-80It has already been necessary to defer some projects in 1974-75 in order to keep expenditure within thecontrol total. One consequence in England andWales is that the present policy of giving first priority to Health Centre projects is to be changed,because progress has been so rapid in the past twoyears that too much of the total allocation is nowdrawn towards Health Centre expenditure. Anyfurther reductions would worsen the situation and, inparticular, would slow down the closing of the oldworkhouses and the building of homes for the younger physically handicapped; would slow downprogress in building units in the community for the mentally handicapped to meet the targets set out in cmnd. 4683 with consequences for the hospital services and would lead to the deferment of some more key projects for children needing care, par-ticularly observation and assessment centres.local    authority    personal    social    servicescurrent27. The existing forecasts before the inclusion ofexpenditure on concessionary fares provide for anaverage annual compound growth rate of 8-6 percent in line with the Cmnd. 5178 figures. Theconsequences of reducing the growth rate to 8 per
cent and to 7-6 per cent from 1975-76 have been examined. Adjustments would probably be of thefollowing order:  million	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78a.	+0-3	-3-8	-6-3b.	-1-2	-7-1	-11-6The present growth rate is high by comparison with most other local authority programmes, but has reached this level only in the past few years, as theresult of national pressures and various pieces oflegislation. The base from which it began was verysmall. Reductions of the order postulated above would inevitably mean slowing-down some specialprogrammes, such as for the mentally handicappedAs the result of the surge in capital works, the conse-quences on running expenditure are now estimated to absorb about 6 per cent of the annual develop-ment increase, leaving about 2\ per cent to meet the pressures for increasing services such as home helps,social workers and meals at home.28. These reductions would thus have to fall on thepreventive and domiciliary services if authorities areto avoid leaving new residential accommodationunused. If the reductions in capital expenditureindicated in paragraph 26 above were made, further reductions in current expenditure in 1976-77 of 2 million and in 1977-78 of  4-3 million might beassumed to occur, because of reduced pressure onrecurrent expenditure flowing from the capital programme.21.

Italics indicate that the estimates have the status explained in the footnote to paragraph 5 of Part 1. See also Annex A to Part 1.7. Includes  77 million in 1975-76 and  198 million in 1976-77 already provided for in the 1972 Public Expenditure Survey.Policy assumptions1. The programme is a projection of the social security programme underlying Cmnd. 5178 as modified by subsequent Ministerial decisions but with the provision for upratings from 1974 onwardsincreased so as to illustrate the cost of improving the benefits in real terms every year. On some points the Department of Health and Social Securityhave reservations (see paragraph 11).Upratings2. The assumption underlying Cmnd. 5178 was thatthe upratings in 1973, 1974 and 1976 would be in line with the movement of prices since the previousuprating and that the uprating in 1975 would be in line with the movement of prices since the 1974uprating plus the movement of real earnings sincethe 1973 uprating. This assumption was the resultof adapting the previous programme, when upratingswere biennial, to the change to annual upratihgs,the new upratings being assumed to be in line with prices only. The date of uprating in each of thefour years was assumed to be 16th November.3. It has now been decided that the 1973 upratingshould be brought forward to 1st October and that,for the first time, there should be a bigger increasein the long-term benefits than in the short-term. Thelong-term benefits will be increased by 14-8 per cent and the short-term benefits by 8-9 per cent. on present assumptions about the movement of prices the real improvement will be 6-4 per cent and0-9 per cent respectively over the benefit ratesestablished by the uprating in October 1972. Thiscomparison ignores the  10 special payment madeto pensioners in December 1972.4. Since the start of the national insurance scheme in 1948 pensions have moved broadly in line with earnings, albeit with greater or less delay and someups and downs. In the last three years (including1973), although the upratings have not altogetherkept pace with earnings, the broad effect has been tocontinue this policy. This year&apos;s costing thereforeillustrates the effect of continuing the policy on theworking assumption that upratings of long-term benefits in line with the movement of earnings willtake place annually. This working assumption is,however, arbitrary in that the timing of improve-ments in the event will depend on the conjuncturalsituation and the discretion of Ministers to provideno more than compensation for prices. For short-term benefits, however, it has been assumed that thepolicy, started with the 1973 uprating, of providingcompensation for prices only, with a small safetymargin (1  per cent), will be continued throughoutthe period of the Survey. The same assumption as before is made about the date of each uprating(16th November).5. The following table shows the extra cost, overthe programme in Cmnd. 5178 revalued, of:(a) the 1973 uprating as now decided, and its priceprotection at each subsequent uprating;(b) the real improvement in the upratings from1974 onwards, on the assumptions given above.  million at 1973 Survey prices1973 1974 1975 1976-74    -75    -76    -77Cost over Cmnd. 5178 revalued of:1973 uprating and its subsequentprice-protectionUpratings  1974 to  1976-realimprovement      .     .149    219    237    239335444CONFIDENTIAL89
Family allowances6. Family allowances are assumed to remain fixed in money terms throughout the period of the Survey.It was however agreed by Ministers that at theappropriate time it would be possible to considerclaims on the contingency reserve for up to 15 million a year to provide additional help forpoor families.  3^ million of this has already been spent on extending the currency of award for variousmeans-tested benefits (school meals, welfare milk and family income supplement) from 6 months to 12.Family income supplement7. It is now settled policy to uprate family income supplement annually every autumn, at the same time as the other benefits. The figures therefore assume that expenditure on this benefit will remain at a fixed level in real terms throughout the period of the survey.Short-term benefits8. Pending decisions on the report of the PAR on short-term benefits shortly to come before Ministers,no change has been assumed in the structure of these benefits. As in last year&apos;s Survey, it has been assumed that earnings-related supplement will be payable at the 15 per cent rate on earnings between 30 and whatever upper limit is set for the paymentof graduated contributions. This limit will be raised from  48 to  54 in October 1973 and is assumed tobe raised in line with the movement of earnings at each uprating thereafter.Tax credit scheme. The target date for the start of the tax credit scheme is 1977. The scheme will have considerableeffects on the social security programme, but it isnot possible to take account of these until the detailsof the scheme have been settled and a decision reached on how tax credits are to be treated for public expenditure purposes.Rate of growth of the programme10. The annual rate of growth of the programme in real terms, year on year, is as follows:per cent1973-74    1974-75    1975-76    1976-77    1977-781-2 4-1 2-6 2-4 2-5The average annual rate, of growth of the programme in real terms from 1972-73 to 1977-78 is 2-5 percent. This figure reduces to 2 -1 per cent if varia-tions in the numbers of beneficiaries are excludedand account is taken only of real improvements in benefits.Reservations by the Department of Health and social Security11.  The Department^ reservations are as follows:UPRATINGS(a) The DHSS point out that there is increasing pressure to improve the pension in relation to earnings and that, in their view, the present rate of pension enables unfavourable com-comparisons to be made with the rates paid inother e.c. countries. Over recent years the pension has been declining as a proportion of average earnings. The 1973 uprating willreverse this trend, on present forecasts of themovement of earnings between October 1972and October 1973; but there will be no further improvement thereafter since the upratings inthe programme are assumed to be in line with, but not more than, the movement of earnings.(b) The programme assumes a growing differentialbetween the rates of the long-term benefits andthose of the short-term benefits. It may wellnot prove possible to persist with this to thefull extent shown.(c) The date of upratings from 1974 onwards is assumed to be 16th November. In the threepreceding years the upratings will have been on 20th September 1971, 2nd October 1972and 1st October 1973. On this pattern it may prove difficult to make any uprating last for13\ months. If the uprating date in 1974 and later years were brought forward to 1st October, there would be additional expenditure of about  40 million a year.FAMILY SUPPORTFamily allowances were last increased in 1968.The only provision for expenditure on familysupport is the  11^ million remaining of the 15 million which Ministers agreed might be madeavailable from the contingency reserve. public discussion of the tax credit scheme is likely to add to pressure for improvements in family allowances in advance of the introduction of tax credits in1977. It cannot therefore be assumed that the 11^ million will be adequate for expenditure on family support in the intervening period.-OTHER IMPROVEMENTS(a) The disabled. Various improvements havebeen made in the provision of cash benefits for the disabled, but there is heavy pressure for further development. The subject is currently under study as a PAR which seems likely to produce recommendations for additional expenditure, though it is not yetpossible to quantify this.(b) One-parent families. The report of the FinerCommittee on one-parent families is due bythe end of the year and is expected to contain
recommendations for further expenditurethough, again, it is not yet possible toquantify this.(c) Supplementary benefit disregards.   It may bedifficult to continue refusing to increase theamounts of income disregarded for supple-mentary benefit, which have not been raisedsince 1966. A 50 per cent increase is alreadyjustified by the rise in prices since 1966 andwould cost  12 million a year.(d) Development of the selective benefits. Theremay be a need for further improvement inthe selective benefits. For example, a doub-ling in 1974 of the age addition paid to pensioners aged 80 and over would cost an extra  14 million a year. Criticism seems likely to continue of the level of the allow-ances for additional heating for which some people receiving supplementary benefitqualify. To raise these allowances by one-third in 1974 would cost an extra  3 million.(e) Payment   of   pocket   money   to   certainpsychiatric patients. Patients in psychiatrichospitals have their pocket money allowanceadministered by the hospital authority and do not in practice get as much as they wouldunder the supplementary benefit rules governing pocket money for similar patients in other hospitals. It would cost  3 million a year to eliminate this discrimination.  Theintention is to hold the present situation aslong as possible but, if pressure increased,it would be very difficult to resist a change.if) Earnings rule for retirement pensioners. Thelimit above which the pension is reduced onaccount of earnings needs increasingperiodically in line with the movement of earnings, but this is not specifically allowed for. To make such an increase every (say)two years would involve expenditure risingby about  2 million each year.ALTERNATIVE POLICY IMPLICATIONS12. As an example of a smaller scale of upratingthan that given in paragraphs 4 and 5, the cost ofthe programme would be reduced if, from 1974onwards, the long-term benefits were not upratedin line with the movement of earnings but their real improvement were held back to the amountof the safety margin which has been assumed forthe short-term benefits, i.e. \\ per cent each year.The effect on the 1973 Survey programme would be:  million at 1973 Survey prices1974 1975 1976 1977-75      -76     -77     -78Upratings 1974 to 1976-realimprovement limited to liper cent a year .      .      .    -10    -43    -96   -15422.

The greater proportion of the total is for theRevenue Departments with smaller sums for theDepartment of the Environment, the Department ofHealth and Social Security and local authorities.The largest single increase in expenditure during1972-73 results from the build up of an extra6,000 staff to administer VAT whilst the reductionCONFIDENTIAL 91
in the following year is due principally to a fallin DHSS expenditure following the abolition ofSET. The estimates allow for an increase in InlandRevenue staff for the restructured national insurancescheme, offset to some extent by the run-down ofsurtax staff following the introduction of the unifiedsystem of personal taxation. The decrease after1975-76 is caused mainly by the virtual cessation of payments to local authorities in respect of Driverand Vehicle Licensing following the transfer of these functions to the Department of the Environment.Royal Mint2. The estimates for the years from 1973-74onwards allow for the fact that VAT on inputs to united Kingdom coins will now be included inthe Minfs costs in producing those coins. Theestimated requirements of the various denominationsof United Kingdom coins have been reassessed inthe light of experience, leading to reductions in1973-74 and 1974-75 and increases in 1975-76 and1976-77. There has also been some reassessment ofthe proper allocation of costs to United Kingdomcoinage work and of the likely receipts fromrecovered silver etc. ^3. Requirements of plant for Phase II of the newMint have been modified. The plant will nowcost a total of  2-6 million ( 1-3 million of thiswas spent in the years 1971-72 and 1972-73).Buildings for Phase II are included under &quot; other financial administration&quot; and are now expectedto cost a total of  3-3 million. ( 1 million of thiswas spent in the years before 1973-74.)4. Provision is made in the years 1976-77 and1977-78 for plant to a total cost of  0-5 million to provide an additional process at Llantrisant whichwould enable another category of overseas coinwork to be undertaken there. A building to housethis at a cost of  0-2 million is included under&quot; Other financial administration&quot; in the years1975-76 to 1977-78.Post-war Credits5. The figures reflect the decision to repay post-warcredits in the course of 1972 and 1973.Other financial administration6. The costs of the Department for national savings account for over  20 million a year. also included is the cost of the Treasury and certaincosts incurred by the Bank of England, includingthe note issue, work on the management of theNational Debt, and the Bank of England&apos;s capitalexpenditure.ALTERNATIVE POLICY IMPLICATIONSRoyal Mint7.

The programme as shown in the table aboverepresents in aggregate a marginal decrease in expenditure compared with Cmnd. 5178 revalued,increases in 1974-75 and 1975-76 being offset bydecreases in 1973-74 and 1976-77.2. This has been achieved despite the need toprovide for extra expenditure on certain projects.These include new buildings for the Inland Revenuecomputerisation schemes. In addition, Cmnd. 5178was based in part on the 1971 forecast of CivilService numbers, but the present figures are basedon the 1972 forecast.3. There has been some offsetting net slippagein expenditure on new works projects. It has alsobeen possible to absorb part of the increased costof Civil Service staff numbers and extra spendingon civil emergency precautions by reductions in thelevel of expenditure on maintenance and running costs. The remainder of the net change is due tothe first steps towards segregation of the transactionsof the Property Services Agency&apos;s Supplies division from other voted expenditure, prior to establishing the Division on a Trading Fund basis. This hasinvolved charging for services shown in this programme (and, on a much smaller scale, other programmes) on a commercial basis, with acorresponding increase in receipts which, after certain adjustments to minimise the effect, produce an apparent net reduction in expenditure.4. It has not been possible to agree on the figuresfor capital expenditure shown in the table. TheProperty Services Agency submitted forecasts which include  25 million for expenditure on the creationof a Greater Parliament Square. The PSA also included  2-75 million a year from 1974-75onwards on modernising accommodation in existing government offices. The Parliament Square ex-penditure is additional to the cost of constructionof a Conference Centre, provision for which was included in this programme in Cmnd. 5178.5. Since Greater Parliament Square and the officemodernisation programme (part of a package ofnew policies) have yet to be approved by Ministers,the Treasury view is that the expenditure should be omitted from the expenditure forecast of existing
policy. They have therefore reduced the Depart-menfs figures by the amount included for these items.Stationery Office (Home)6. HMSO supplies Government Departments withtheir printing, publishing, stationery and officemachinery, and it also supplies some other public sector bodies. Provision for 1974-75 to 1976-77 is some  6 million lower than in Cmnd. 5178 revaluedbecause the current forecasts are projected from a lower base the 1973-74 Estimate-than thosemade earlier. Increases from year to year coverexpected growth in service, especially in the fields of photo-copying and automatic machines forgeneral typing pools.Central Computer Agency7. The Agency&apos;s role is to promote the applicationof computer systems in Government with the aim off improving administrative efficiency and wideningpolicy choices. It advises Departments on systems;on the capabilities of hardware, software and other equipment; on facilities available within Govern-ment and outside; and on project and installationmanagement. It also provides centralised pur-chasing and contractual services. With effect from 1st January 1973 the Agency assumed responsibilityfor the formulation of policy on and financial controlof telecommunications used in Government for adminsitrative purposes. The increase in 1975-76over Cmnd. 5178 revalued is occasioned byprovision for the acquisition of computers to thevalue of  5-9 million for the tax credit scheme.Home publicity8. This covers expenditure on publicity campaignsby the Central Office of Information for other government Departments, which are directedprincipally at audiences in the United Kingdomthrough the media of press and televisionadvertising, films and exhibitions. Related printingcosts by HMSO are included. Forecasts which departments made of their publicity requirements have been substantially reduced. Provision in 1973-74 took account of publicity necessary for theintroduction of Value Added Tax, and for legal aid, together with minor increases to coveradditional needs for other purposes. The figures for1974-75 onwards reflect the phasing out of non-continuous campaigns.COSTED VARIANTSAccommodation (Home)9. It has not been considered possible to include any alternative costing line for this programme.The furnishing, rent and maintenance and running costs of existing buildings and those planned to betaken into the estate are largely irreducible commit-ments given the staff numbers to be housed andthe agreed standards of provision; steps have alreadybeen taken to economise on expenditure so that itis as low as possible in relation to the requirements.The only variable item in the programme is thecapital cost of new construction and the relatedDepartmental Administration expenditures. Theoffice building programme is however designed tomeet part of the need for accommodation to housestaff and is as an alternative to renting accommoda-tion. If additions to the estate are not provided bynew Crown building they must be leased from private developers. Ministers have recentlyaccepted in principle the economic case for buildingrather than leasing since there is no saving inresources in cutting back on Crown building and very large losses in terms of extra rents incurred.Stationery Office (Home)10. Lower alternative costings are not possible forthe basic office services which are provided byHMSO at the request of other Departments. TheDepartments choices are largely limited to the best way of organising itself to meet these services.Central Computer Agency11. It has not been considered possible to include any alternative costing fine for this programme.The demand for computers comes from outside the agency and additional requirements stem fromMinisterial decisions, e.g. the tax credit scheme,elsewhere. The use of computers producesimprovements in efficiency and savings in staff thus reducing the cost of other programmes.Home publicity12. A lower level of expenditure could only beapplied equitably as a cut across the board on all departments.

This includes expenditure by several Govern-ment departments (the Office of Population Censusesand Surveys, General Register Office (Scotland),Land Registry, Ordnance Survey and minorexpenditure in other departments) and a smalleramount of local authority expenditure. Theexpenditure on Social Surveys, carried out on an allied service basis, for Government departments is included. Part of the decrease in expenditure after1971-72 results from the completion of the 1971Census.2. No decision has yet been taken on a mid-termCensus in 1976, which would cost between  14million and  15 million, and no provision has been included in this Survey.3. The Land Registry&apos;s forecast income from ad valorem fees shows a decrease of  2- 3 million ayear by comparison with Cmnd. 5178 revalued.This reflects the sharp fall from 16 per cent to 8 percent in the rate of increase in house prices which took place during the last quarter of 1972.4. Provision is made for administrative expensesof the proposed Office of Fair Trading. When thisis established the provision will become the separateresponsibility of the Director-General who will bethe Accounting Officer.Broadcasting (capital expenditure)5. Expenditure covers the capital requirements ofthe   British   Broadcasting   Corporation   (Homeservices) and the Independent broadcasting authority. The Corporation and the Authority are co-ordinating separately financed programmes forthe construction of UHF stations to transmit BBCand IBA television services on 625 lines (black and white and colour). The aim is to increase thepresent coverage of nearly 92 per cent attained bythe UHF stations to about 96 per cent by 1977-78.The Corporation^ expenditure (capital and current)is financed by Government grant which at presentconsists of the whole of net licence revenue. TheAuthority provides transmitters to broadcast the programmes of independent television companies and is financed by the rentals charged to those companies. Following the extension of its functions under the Sound Broadcasting Act 1972 theAuthority is also providing transmitters to broadcastthe programmes of independent radio contractors,the first of whom have now been appointed, whoserentals will finance the capital expenditure involvedexcept in the initial period during which provisionfor the IBA to draw up to  2 million on loan hasbeen made in the Sound Broadcasting Act 1972.Meteorological services. This covers the cost of services provided for both civil and defence purposes. These estimates,for both purposes, which cannot be separatelyidentified, are included in the Defence Budget(Table 1). An equivalent reduction is made toOther military defence (Table 2) in order to includethe expenditure in Miscellaneous services.
Civil defence7. The forecasts provide for continuing improve-ment in the state of preparedness in oivil defence,while maintaining the current average level of annual expenditure.Civil emergencies8. The expenditure in 1973-74 is the cost of thefirst instalment of additional flour following thedecision to increase the stockpile from 9 weeks to12 weeks supply, together with expenditure of  1 million on modifying storage facilities. Expenditurein later years associated with the remaining build-upof the stockpile is treated as a possible addition see Annex B of the Main Report.Royal parks and palaces, ancient monuments and grants for historic buildings9. Expenditure on staff costs and certain capital and current expenditure is attributed to theprogramme for the first time. The amounts shownin the table are consistent with the policy on whichthe Cmnd. 5178 figures were based.10. The Department of the Environment, theScottish Office and Welsh Office note that theprovisions for the repair and maintenance of historicbuildings and for grants to outstanding conservationareas are cash figures, and that no revaluation hasbeen allowed to the Cmnd. 5178 provisions. they also note that with rapidly rising costs and theintroduction of VAT the commitment rations will come under considerable pressure in the near future.Other miscellaneous services11. The estimates in Table 24 include receipts of 7 million accruing mainly in 1973-74, from thesale of assets of the State Management Districts ofCarlisle, Gretna and Cromarty Firth.12. About a third of the amounts in the table forthis item are net lending and investment overseasof Cable and Wireless Limited. It is a Governmentowned company which provides internationalcommunication and internal telephone systems ina number of overseas countries. It provides animportant link in the Commonwealth telecommunications-munications system. The investment plans of thecompany are to be reviewed later in the year, so the estimates are provisional.COSTED VARIANTSBroadcasting (capital expenditure)13. The BBC and IBA are providing for capital programmes for UHF transmissions on 625 lines(colour and black and white) which will reach 98per cent of the population by 1980. In the case ofthe BBC this is a faster rate of growth than in cmnd. 5178. The Ministry of Posts and telecommunications are strongly opposed to cuts inthis programme. Any substantial reduction in theprogramme would deny television to an increasing number of viewers in areas served only by 405line transmissions for, from 1975 onwards, setscapable of receiving them will no longer be manufactured; it will become increasingly difficultto obtain spares for these sets. The Treasury feelthat the alternative of a more phased programmedoes exist, although they agree with the Ministrythat the political difficulties of denying orwithdrawing television services would need serious consideration, which could await the outcome ofthe recently approved enquiry into broadcasting in rural England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales.25.

Table 25 has been compiled from estimates which are prepared by the Northern Ireland Depart-ments and it sets out the expenditure for which these departments are now responsible. It is important to note that this table does not represent the full extent of public expenditure in Northern Ireland.The most significant items which do not appear inthe above table are the cost of the Army and defence generally and the major part of agricultural support that has been applied to the UnitedKingdom as a whole.2. The Northern Ireland Temporary Provisions Acthas been extended for a further year and the Secre-tary of State for Northern Ireland thereforecontinues to be directly responsible for the experidi-ture of the Northern Ireland Departments. The tablemakes no attempt to take account of the changesenvisaged in the White Paper &quot;Northern IrelandConstitutional Proposals &quot; (Cmnd. 5259). Futureaccountability for that part of public expenditurethat arises on any services transferred to NorthernIreland will probably be to the new Northern ireland assembly but the United Kingdom Government will retain direct responsibility for the &quot; excepted &quot; and&quot; reserved &quot; areas of expenditure and direct Parlia-mentary accountability for that area will continue tobe to Westminster. The major area of expenditure for which responsibility will remain with the UnitedKingdom Government will be law and order thoughexpenditure on Trade, industry and employment andon Agriculture will be subject to consultation and agreement between the United Kingdom Govern-ment and Northern Ireland.3. The basic pattern of expenditure in NorthernIreland continues to follow that in the rest of theUnited Kingdom but the special circumstances inNorthern Ireland play an important part in deter-mining the level Of expenditure on particularprogrammes: e.g. law and order reflects to asubstantial degree expenditure on compensation forterrorist damage; and assistance to industry reflects the high level of unemployment that prevails inNorthern Ireland.4. The figures in the above table show that present estimates exceed the forecast in Cmnd. 5178 revaluedby  68 million. Most of this can be traced to thelarge increase in expenditure on law and order.The estimates for other programmes notablyhousing and assistance to industry have been reviseddownwards. These lower estimates reflect lower levels of activity which in turn are the result of thedisturbed conditions in Northern Ireland. Thefollowing tables illustrate this.Public Sector Housing Number of Completions	1972	1973	1974	1975	1976	1977	-73	-74	-75	-76	-77	-781972 Survey	-.&apos;  9,800	10,390	10,900	10,900	10,900	1973 Survey	 	7,500	8,000	9,100	9,400	10,000						Jobs created with public assistance							1972	1973	1974	1975	1976	1977	-73	-74	-75	-76	-77	-781972 Survey	.   4,000	8,000	8,000	8,000	8,000	_1973 Survey	 	5,000	7,000	7,500	8,000	8,0005. Extensive changes in local government orgariisa-tion, with many important services becoming the direct responsibility of the Northern Ireland Govern-ment, will come into effect in 1973. As a consequence there has been a certain amount ofreclassification of expenditure and revision of estimates following closer scrutiny by NorthernIreland Departments. This has lead to an additionof about  16 million during the period 1973-74 to1976 77.CONFIDENTIAL97
SPECIAL1.  Local authorities&apos; expenditureCurrent expenditure . In this analysis the forecasts of current expen-diture on local authority services described in thepreceding section of Part 2 are brought together.With the exception noted in paragraph 3 below allforecasts are on the price basis of the current rate support Grant Orders.ENGLAND AND wales. The outturn for 1971-72 reflects the actual out-turn submitted by local authorities. No information is yet available from local authorities of their expenditure in 1972-73, but the provisional outturnshown reflects Departments&apos; estimates in the lightof the actual outturn for 1971-72.3. For 1973-74 the individual service figures andthe total are generally consistent with the relevant expenditure forecasts agreed for the purpose of the1972 Rate Support Grant Order in November 1972.The Education figures, however, reflect the Minis-terial decision after the conclusion of the rate support Grant negotiations to defer the increase inschool meals charges due to take place from 1stApril 1973. The consequential addition to localauthority outgoings will be taken into account ina future Rate Support Grant Increase Order. Inaddition the figures for charges which are expressedin the Rate Support Grant Order in cash terms havebeen converted to a constant price basis. Moreover,1972-73Total current expenditure (Survey basis)   . 4-8Total revenue expenditure (RSG basis)     . 5-5SCOTLAND7. The Scottish figures are generally on a similar basis, those for 1971-72 reflecting the actual outturnas submitted by local authorities.8. The forecasts for 1973-74 are generally thoseagreed for the purposes of the March 1973 rate support Grant Order. That for Education is slightly above the figure agreed in the Order, mainly on account of the decision to defer the school mealscharge, hut also partly to take account of ananticipated increase in pupil and teacher numbers.ANALYSESthe forecasts for Law and Order assume a slightly lower level of police manpower than was accepted in the negotiations.4. The forecasts for the individual services apartfrom Local Health (see paragraph 5 below) generallyproject forward the expenditure trends which emerged from the 1972 Rate Support Grant Settle-ment. For 1974-75 however these projected figures have been reduced as a contribution to the savings in public expenditure required in that year. forecasts for 1975-76 and subsequent years have not for thepresent been reduced to take account of the lower level of expenditure now expected in 1974-75. this possibility is discussed in Annex D to the MainReport.5. The figures for Local Health, apart from1974-75 are those in Cmnd. 5178 revalued, amended to include estimated expenditure on Family Plan-ning. The forecasts for Miscellaneous Local Servicestake account of extra expenditure which will result from local government reorganisation. They do not however include any provision for the cost of thenew attendance allowance for local authoritymembers to be introduced from 1st April 1974,the level of which has yet to be agreed by Ministers.6. The forecasts for all services from 1971-72onwards represent in percentage terms the followingrates of growth from the previous financial year.Per cent				1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-786-6	2-7	6-7	4-6	4-47-2	3-6	7-1	5-2	4-99. The forecasts for years after 1973-74 generallyproject forward the expenditure trends which emerged from the Rate Support Grant Settlement.As with England and Wales however reductions havebeen made to the forecasts for 1974-75 to providepublic expenditure savings in that year. Noconsequential changes have been made to the fore-casts for subsequent years.10. As with England and Wales, provision hasbeen Included within Miscellaneous Local Services
for the consequential costs of the reorganisation oflocal government in Scotland in 1975. The Adminis-tration of Justice forecasts now allow only for net expenditure on Burgh and J. P.

Capital expenditure12. From the financial year 1971-72 the arrange-ments for controlling capital expenditure by localauthorities in England and Wales were significantlychanged. The table reflects the new arrangements,full details of which are set out in circulars 2/70 and66/71 of the Department of the Environment (116/70and 138/71 Welsh Office). Their broad outlines are however as follows.13. Local authority capital expenditure is nowdivided into two categories. &quot; Key sector &quot; schemesremain subject to specific approval by Departments.However, land acquisition associated with such schemes in the field of education, local authority housing and principal roads, no longer requiresapproval since it is assumed to be related to approved programmes of new construction in these fields; and slum clearance under Parts II and III ofthe Housing Act 1957, improvements under theHousing Act 1959, and the purchase of buses bymunicipal transport undertakings have also beendeemed free of control for the time being. Withinthe remaining &quot; locally determined&quot; sector, local-authorities are free to incur capital expendituresubject to an overall annual limit on payments;within their annual allocations authorities can deter-mine their own priorities between projects and services. Over or under spending in any one yearup to a limit of 10 per cent of the allocation is allowed provided that the amount in question is charged against or added to the allocation for the succeeding year. In the case of counties, the alloca-tion covers both the county council and the district councils, and it is for the authorities within thecounty jointly to determine how the allocation is tobe applied.14. To arrive at the total of the allocations to authorities, it is necessary to make adjustments to thepublic expenditure estimates shown in the table.Forecast expenditure from revenue and from capitalfunds is deducted since this expenditure does not count against authorities&apos; allocations. Allowance hasalso to be made for the fact that the allocation is tobe made at estimated outturn prices. In the pastit has also been necessary to make an addition to the survey figures to take account of known dis-crepancies between the capital payments returns oflocal authorities, and their final account figures. the explanation of these discrepancies has however nowbeen brought to light as a result of the improvedstandard of statistical returns, and the public expenditure estimates for miscellaneous local services in this Report have been accordingly adjusted to reflect in full the capital expenditure incurred bylocal authorities.15. Individual allocations for locally determinedschemes are calculated largely by formula and authorities are advised of their formula allocation inadvance of the beginning of the financial year inorder that they may have adequate time to plan their capital expenditure programmes. There have been no changes in the breakdown of expenditure betweenkey and locally determined sectors since last year.The reorganisation of local government on1st April 1974 and the simultaneous transfer of theresponsibility for certain services away from localgovernment will however result in some change inthe composition of the locally determined pool.Expenditure on small sewerage schemes, which is atpresent locally determined, will become part of the responsibilities of the new Regional water authorities and will consequently pass out of thecontrol of local government.16. One of the main objectives in introducing alocally determined sector was to give localauthorities greater freedom in deciding prioritieswithin this area. Present indications are that thishas resulted in some redistribution of expenditure between the various programmes which includelocally determined expenditure. It is not possible tosay however whether there has been a permanentshifting in local authority priorities, and the break-down between services within the locally determinedsector still partly reflects Departmental estimates ofwhat local authorities would have been likely to have spent on their services had the previous loansanction control arrangements remained unchanged.SCOTLAND17. There has been no change so far in the overallarrangements for controlling capital expenditure bylocal authorities in Scotland, although a pilotscheme with a small number of authorities has been introduced in 1973-74. The table below simplydraws together the forecasts of expenditure byScottish local authorities included in the functionaltables, and the provisos regarding accuracy of the breakdown between services do not apply to thesame extent.

3.  Population and employment. The increase in population, either in total orin particular age groups, affects a wide range of programmes. The latest projections are thereforesummarised in the following table.2. It shows that for most age groups the estimates are lower than those in use at the time of the 1972Survey. This is partly because the projections startfrom a lower base derived from the preliminaryresults of the 1971 census which put the 1971population at a level some 374,000 or 0-7 per centbelow the previous estimate for 1971. In addition the future growth is slower. because of lowerassumptions about the number of future births.3. This of course is reflected in the slower rate of growth predicted for the younger age groups. For1977 (the end of the period covered in last year&apos;sSurvey) the estimate for the 0-4 years age-group hasbeen reduced by 308,000 or 6-7 per cent, and forthe 5-15 years age group by 111,000 or 1-1 percent. These two groups account for about halfthe reduction from the 1977 level predicted last year.The balance is accounted for mainly by the lowerbase, and the effect of this is shown most clearly inthe age group containing people over! 16 but underretirement age. The growth rate is much the sameas last year but the level is, some 300,000 lowerthroughout the period.4. The size of the working population in 1972 is virtually the same as in last year&apos;s estimates but the projected growth is slowed leading to an increase of only 50,000 in the periodjUp to 1977 compared withan increase of 180,000 oyer the same period in theprevious projections. Tjhe current estimates take account of the 1971 census data but are provisionalpending a full reworking&apos;of the calculations.5. Figures are not shown for earlier years as these are not available on a basis consistent withthe new figures for 1972 onwards.t

A short commentary on the main programmesfollows.3. The defence development programme is designed to assist the Services to meet their equipment requirements in the most economical and effective way compatible with the budgetary and resources restraints on the equipment programme.These requirements arise from the commitmentsplaced on the Services by the Governmenfs defenceobjectives. The development programme is dividedup under the broad headings of aircraft; guided weapons; electronics; ship construction, navalweapons and equipment, and ordnance and other
army equipment. In addition there are a numberof other minor fields of work. The main headingsinclude activities carried out on a collaborative basis with a number of other nations. Details of the mainprojects involved in this breakdown are given in chapter 6 of Cmnd. 5231. The defence research programme is designed to support the defencedevelopment programme by providing the body of knowledge necessary to the devising or appraisalof new equipment. The programme, which is controlled by procedures including an annual reviewto determine future trends and possible changes inemphasis, is managed as 19 major fields of research(aerodynamics, aero engines, armoured fighting vehicles, etc.)4. The entry under Research Councils etc.comprises the residual Science Budget of theDepartment of Education and Science following thetransfer of funds to Customer Departmentsannounced in &quot; A Framework for government research and Development&quot; Cmnd. 5046. Expendi-ture by the Department for Agriculture andFisheries, Scotland, in respect of agricultural research, Scotland is now included underAgriculture, fisheries and forestry.5. The Department of Trade and Industry&apos;sprogrammes are concerned primarily with assistanceto industry, but include also a number of Govern-ment requirements determined by statutory obli-gations or administrative or operational needs.The forecasts include expenditure on aircraft andaeroengine projects and assistance (mainly Concordeand RB211); expenditure by Government research establishments and those of the Atomic energy authority; grants to Research Associations; otherextramural support for industrial technology; ship-ping services; departmental expenditure on civilaviation; expenditure on national and internationalspace projects; and the United Kingdom contri-bution towards R&amp;D on the tripartite centrifugeproject. In accordance with the White Paper on government R&amp;D (Cmnd. 5046) expenditure on general industrial R&amp;D is now subject to theapproval of Requirements Boards. The forecastsfrom 1973-74 onwards include provision for work by NERC on repayment, transferred from the science Budget in accordance with Cmnd. 5046.No provision has been made for major new projectsas yet unapproved (e.g. new aircraft and aeroengineprojects).6. Other Departments] expenditure on R&amp;D is relatively less significant. The programmes of theMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food areconcerned mainly with agricultural development,control of animal and plant pests and diseases,fisheries research, food science research and botanyresearch. Those of the Department of the environment cover building, construction, planning,transport and environmental research, including expenditure by the Departments four research establishments. DHSS is concerned mainly withresearch into the functions of health care and personal social services, medical equipment, hospital building and engineering, computer applications,and with locally organised clinical research.5. PARs related to PESC programmesSince 1971 the Public Expenditure Survey machineryhas been strengthened by the system of programme analysis and Review (PAR), whereby each majorDepartment does at least one in-depth policy studyannually in a selected area of public expenditure.PAR subjects are chosen by Ministers after con-sideration by a committee of officials (PARC).

6.  Maplin1. Expenditure connected with the Maplin projectis included in several different functional pro-grammes. The only identified reference in the tablesis to the capital expenditure of the MaplinDevelopment Authority (included in the trade,industry and employment block). The tables belowdraw the figures together so as to indicate the total public expenditure involved.2. No account is taken of sales of land by theMinistry of Defence to the Maplin development authority, or by the Maplin Development Authorityto the British Airports Authority, the Port ofLondon Authority and the Civil Aviation Authoritybecause of uncertainty about timing and prices. Inany event these transactions would be within thepublic sector and so have no net effect on public expenditure. The British Airways Board are not included in the tables it is not expected that any significant expenditure would be incurred by theBoard at Maplin before the end of the forecastperiod.3. At this stage many of the figures are inevitablytentative. The first table assumes that the firstrunway will be open in 1980 and the figures havebeen agreed with departments. Some slippage isprobably unavoidable and this run of figures istherefore likely to be on the high side and isbeing reviewed. The second, which represents thelower costed option, is on the basis of an openingdate of 1983. Apart from new towns and BAAexpenditure, these figures have been agreed with departments. The Treasury have assumed that all expenditure associated with the New Town(including roads) could be deferred for threeyears if the opening date were postponed until 1983. This would involve a firmdecision in advance to keep the rate of build-up of the New Town as at present and to begin itat a later date. The alternative would be tolengthen the period of build-up and this would bethe Department^ preference. This would resultin very little deferment of expenditure on the NewTown. On roads, DOE maintain that, Maplinroads having been absorbed into the existingceilings of the PESC bloc, any savings on Maplinshould also be available within the same ceiling.Furthermore they hold it wrong to cut the road programme by individual projects; in the past that programme has been treated as an entity andsmooth progress can only be maintained on thebasis of a given ceiling on expenditure, and not ofagreement to a specific list of projects.4. The lower costed option for BAA expenditure at Maplin has been put in by the Treasury: it isbased on the assumption that this expenditure willbe delayed by at least one year. The Departmenthave been unable to agree to this assumption; they believe that a deferment of the opening date ofthe airport by three years does not necessarily meanany delay at all in the start of BAA constructionwork at Maplin.Maplin expenditure : 1980 opening date  million1973 1974-74    -751975 1976 1977-76    -77    -78Preliminary expenses(Tables 1 and 16)Maplin development authority (Table 7)Rail access (Table 12)Roads Access (Table 13) .Roads New town &quot; urban &quot;roads (Table 13)New Towns Housing, Sew-erage and Other (Tables 15and 16) .BAA investment (Table 11).CAA investment (Table 7) .PLA investment^) (Table 14)Total .MOD expenditure on reloca-tion   of  Shoeburyness(2)(Table 1)Overall total1-8	0-8	0-5	0-5	.0-51-0	15-0	190	17-0	15-00-5	1-7	3-1	3-5	22-00-3	1-4	2-5	3-5	140 .	0-7	2-6	6-6	8-6	3-0	5-5	90	16-5 		-	3-0	15-2- -	 .	0 1	0-9	1-61-5	5-5	7-0	4-5	2-55-1	28-1	40-3	48-5	95-93 0	12-3	17-9	17-9	16-881	40-4	58-2	66-4	112-7(&apos;) These figures assume that PLA expenditure at Maplin willbe offset to a substantial extent by the sale to the MDA forreclamation purposes of fill dredged up by the PLA in con-structing the deep water channel.f2) These figures are a notional phasing of a tentative estimateof a total expenditure on this item of around  100 millionup to 1980-81.Maplin expenditure: 1983 opening date  million. 1973  1974  1975  1976  1977-74    -75    -76    -77    -78Preliminary expenses(Tables 1 and 16)   .Maplin development authority (Table 7)Rail access (Table 12)Roads Access (Table 13) .Roads New town &quot; urban &quot;roads (Table 13)New towns Housing, Sew-erage and Other (Tables 15and 16) .BAA investment (Table 11).CAA investment (Table 7) .PLA investmentC) (Table 14)Total .MOD expenditure on reloca-tion   of  Shoeburynessf2)(Table 1)Overall total1-8    0-8    0-5    0-5    0-5100-31400-61-117-01-32-21502-22-813-02-08-50-73-03-00-5 2-0 3-5 5-0 4-53-6   18-5   24-5  25-5   35-23-0 9-9 14-3 14-3 13-26-6  28-4  38-8   39-8  48-4(&apos;) These figures- assume that PLA expenditure at Maplin willbe offset to a substantial extent by the sale to the MDA forreclamation purposes of fill dredged up by the PLA in con-structing the deep water channel.(2) Extremely tentative estimates.
7. Nationalised industries financing the table below has been included to give an indication of the amount of the capital expenditureof the nationalised industries which is met from themoney paid by their customers for the supply ofgoods and services and the amount contributed bythe Government by way of capital and currentgrants.The figures for capital requirements and grantfinance are the same as those shown elsewhere inthis Report. Those for balance of revenue,depreciation and other capital receipts are derivedfrom returns provided by the industries, adjusted inaccordance with the economic assumptions in thecurrent short-term forecasts.The figures show that in 1972-73 total internalfinance, as defined in the Table, was equivalent toabout 42 per cent of total capital requirements.The corresponding figures for 1973-74 and 1974-75are 41 per cent and 51 per cent, respectively.The revenue figures assume that the nationalised industries will be allowed to increase their pricesduring Stage Two to the maximum extent permitted by the Code.1973 outturn pricesNationalised industries: Methods of financing capital requirements1972-73 1973-74 1974-75Expenditure on fixed assets   .      ...      .      .      .      .      .      . 1,871&apos; 2,145 2,261Less Shortfall........... - -100 -100Total after Shortfall........... 1,871 2,045 2,161Lew Sales of fixed assets.........., -67 -93 -60Gross domestic fixed capital formation........ 1,804 1,952 2,101Other capital expenditure......... 154 105 66Total capital expenditure as shown in this report...... 1,958 2,057 2,167Additional capital expenditure (mainly changes in working capital)    .      .      . 286 240 218Total capital requirements........ 2,244 2,297 2,385Financed by:Balance of revenue .      .......... -280 -380 -235Depreciation .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      .      . 1,140 1,160 1,230Other capital receipts including investment grants     ..... 60 70 90Total internal finance .      ........ 920 850 1,085Current grants by Government........ 230 320 330Capital grants by Government......... 80 85 100Total internal and grant finance.......  .      . 1,230 1,255 1,515Amount of capital expenditure to be financed by borrowing or issues of publicdividend capital .      .      .      ........ 1,014 1,042 870Definitions1.

Changesin Working Capital through a change in the relationship between trade debtors and tradecreditors are not included.confidential. Balance of Revenue is after interest, taxation and dividend on Public Dividend Capital but beforecurrent grants by Government (see 5 and 7 below).3. Depreciation includes supplementary depre-ciation and provisions for accelerated obsolescence.4. Other Capital Receipts includes electricitycustomers&apos; contributions but excludes sales of fixed assets.Ill
5. Current Grants by Government includes alldeficit grants and specific current grants notavailable to private industry e.g. Social Cost grant to NCB and unremunerative services grants to BRB.6. Capital Grants by Government includes grants which   are   not  available   generally e.g.   infra-structure grants and grants to meet the cost ofcapital expenditure.7. All other Government Grants which are also available in the private sector e.g. Fuel Duty RebateGrant and Rural Bus Grants have been included inthe calculation of Balance of Revenue.8.  Support of counter-inflation policyGovernment measures in support of counter-inflationpolicyOver the last year or so there have been a numberof measures involving public expenditure to preventthe full effect of higher costs being passed on to consumers or to maintain the level of individualincomes. These measures which affect a number ofdifferent programmes are summarised below togetherwith an indication of the amounts of public expendi-ture involved.   In many cases it is not possible to separate counter-inflation measures from expendi-ture which would have been incurred under otherpolicies. The figures quoted below must thereforebe regarded as highly conjectural.There have also been some central government measures in support of counter-inflation policy which do not count as public expenditure because they represent intra-public sector transfers. Revaluationrate relief for domestic ratepayers and generous rate support grant settlement are examples of these.  millionCounter-inflation Measure and Part 2 Table	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77	1977-78Milk prices by writing off Milk Fund deficit (Table 5)	31	&apos;&apos;	-   --	. ^- ,:.	-   :&quot;		2&apos;	-&quot;&apos;	&apos; . \j -&apos;				- ;-.	5	&apos;.&apos; - &apos;	-.: -	-	School meals charges (Table 19)......		20	15	15	15	15Increase in rent rebates (Table 15) .      .      .      .      .	-&apos;   -	34	36	38	38	.38Government trading services, fees and charges:						HMSO prices (Table 23).......	1	1	1	1	1	1Goods vehicle testing and licensing (Table 14) .	-	- 3	3	3&quot;	3	:;\    3Court fees and charges (Table 17).....		1	1	1	1	1 K 1 -Marine Survey fees (Table 7)......	1	1	1	1	1	:T&quot;&apos; &quot;lHydrographic Charts and Ordnance Survey (Tables 1 and 24) .	1	1	1	1	1	Lump-sum payments to pensioners (Table 21) .	80	:i   - &apos;	....... bM4-^			1 -- - -&apos;General uprating 1973 (Table 21) .      .      .      .	-   :	149	219	237	239	240Restraint of nationalised industry prices (a)	300	400	300		z?. - - - -	10, T-.(a) Not all the amounts shown would count as public expenditure, though they all represent claims on resources.

They are subject to large margins of uncertainty. No figures are given for years after 1974-75 in view of the difficultyin forecasting. The figures subsume assistance to the National Coal Board (Table 7) and the British Railways Board (Table 14),though probably not all of this is due to the effects of price restraint.

Expenditure onprofessional fees and agency staff is excluded. Thefigures shown for each programme are higher thanthose which would be entered against wages and salaries in an analysis of public expenditure by economic category since the latter relate only towages and salaries forming part of current expendi-ture on goods and services and exclude wages and salaries (a) classified to other economic categoriesand (b) forming part of the operating expenditure of central Government and local authority trading services.

Superannuation3. Table 2 summarises for 1973-74 and 1977-78the transactions of the various pension schemescovering central Government and local authorityemployees. The left-hand side of the table shows the transactions of the various superannuation fund(national or, otherwise) and &quot; pay ass you go&quot;schemes, while the right-hand side shows how these transactions enter into public expenditure and receipts and contribute to the public sector&apos;sborrowing requirement.4. Emerging superannuation costs are expected torise over the period covered by the report due mainly to:(a) increases in the number of pensions in issue;(b) increases in the average amounts of pensionpayment reflecting past salary and wage move-ments.The extra cost will be offset in part by increasedreceipts from employees&apos; contributions.

Manpower5. The numbers of public authority employees,corresponding to the figures for remuneration inTable 1 and with the same coverage, are analysedby broad category in the following table:Manpower employed in the United Kingdom by central Government and local authorities,1971 to 1978TABLE 3 &apos;000 as at 1 April1971 1972 1973 1974 1975 1976 1977 1978actual        actual      estimate     estimate    estimate      estimate     estimate     estimateCentral Government:Civil Service	694	696	716	715	715	742	744	747Armed forces  .	367	372	367	353	346	341	339	338National Health Service	673	702	724	743	762	781	800	819Other     .      .	101	110	112&apos;	118	120	121	123	124Local authorities	1,872	1,954	2,027	2,069	2,191	2,270	2,351	2,420Total .	3,707	3,834	3,946	3,998	4,134	4,255	4,357	4,448In the absence of departmental returns for localauthority employees on certain services, mainly inthe Roads and miscellaneous local services pro-grammes, estimates for these missing categories havebeen made by the Treasury and the figures for localauthorities must be regarded as subject to error.Throughout the table an adjustment has been madeto take account of the -proportion of part-timeemployees. The average annual increase of2-6 per cent in total numbers from 1972 to 1977implied by the figures corresponds with the rate of increase in total remuneration over the correspondingperiod given in Table 1.6. A large proportion of public authorities man-power is employed in the Social Services defined tocover education, health and personal social services,social security, local authority employment services(excluding sheltered workshops) and local authorityprobation and after-care services. In 1973 thenumber estimated to be employed in these sectors isalmost exactly 2 million, 50 per cent of the total public authorities&apos; employees. (This excludes those not technically employed in the public sector butpaid mainly from public funds and doing similar work to those directly employed. The universities,other parts of non-public sector education, anddoctors and dentists outside hospitals form the main categories of excluded staff and probably account fora further 200,000 people.)7. Current public expenditure plans imply that by1978 the total employed in the Social Services willhave risen to just under 2 - 3 million. This represents an annual growth of 3 - 5 per cent a year whichcompares with 4-4 per cent a year in the two years1971 to 1973 and with 3-0 per cent a year in theperiod 1972 to 1977 reported in last year&apos;s public expenditure Survey. A similar picture of a slower rate of increase compared with the last two years buta faster rate than in last year&apos;s programmes emergesfor each of the main services covered except for those coming under the Law and order programme.

The staffing of the Civil Service forms only apart (18 per cent) of the total public service man-power provided for in PESC. An increase of some31,000 in the total number of staff is forecastover the five-year period 1st April 1973 to 1st April1978; in percentage terms this is 4-3 per cent or anaverage annual rate of 0-9 per cent; and this compares with the significantly higher average annualgrowth rates of, for example 2-5 per cent in theNational Health Service and 3-6 per cent in localauthorities.9. The table above breaks down the number ofcivil servants into 12 sections plus a residualelement. The figures for 1st April 1974 and1st April 1975 reflect the recent decision to save 35 million in the cost of the Civil Service for thoseyears. The allocation in the table between depart-ments of the manpower reductions is based on ageneral reduction of 1 per cent at 1st April 1974,the resulting figure held at 1st April 1975, but theactual  allocation  is  still  being  discussed with departments. The figures for the dates beyond1st April 1975 are the original PESC figures and donot therefore show any changes which may follow the reductions in 1974 and 1975. The following paragraphs comment on the increases and decreasesoriginally forecast for the period 1st April 1973 to 1st April 1978 and which are therefore subject tofurther review.10. Sections 1 and 2 cover the departments con-cerned with defence and external policy, the Ministryof Defence alone employing nearly two-fifths of thewhole of the Civil Service. The forecast reductionof over 3,000 posts in the Ministry of Defence is aresult of the continued programme of rationalisationand other economy measures.11. The main reason for the increases in theChancellor of the Exchequer^ departments is theneed to provide Inland Revenue staff to deal withthe earnings-related National Insurance scheme; tosome extent these are offset by the rundown of1
surtax work. Section 3, as well as a number of smaller departments, also covers Customs and excise; and the Department for National Savings.12. In the Department of Employment (Section 4)the increases are accounted for by expansion in industrial training, employment services and occupa-tional safety and health; there are some offsetting savings on benefit work, resulting from the reductions in the forecast level of unemployment and with thetransfer of passport work to the Post Office. Thefigures in the table above do not take any accountof the setting up, outside the Civil Service, of the manpower Services Commission and the operationof employment and training services by agenciesresponsible to that body. This will take about halfthe present staff of the department out of the CivilService.13. In Section 5 DHSS requirements account for anincrease of some 8,600 or nearly 30 per cent of thenet total Civil Service increase over the period 1973to 1978; the needs are mainly for contributory and supplementary benefit work.14. Significant increases in DOE (Section 6) arisingmainly out of the centralisation of driver andvehicle licensing work are largely offset by reductions in the number of industrial staff in the PropertyServices Agency due to reductions in commitments and increases in efficiency and productivity.15. In the Home Office (Section 7), where theincrease of 8,000 represents some 25 per cent of thetotal net increase, in addition to requirements forimmigration work and Police support services themain increases are to provide staff in the prison service to keep pace with the forecast increases in prison population and to reduce overcrowding andovertime working. The latter factors also affect theScottish Office and this is the main reason for theincrease in Section 8.16. Entry into the Common Market is the mainfactor affecting Section 9. Staffing of the depart-ments covered by Sections 10 and 11 is affected by anumber of factors but overall increases will not be substantial.17. The main cause of growth in Section 12 is the increasing crime rate together with the transfer ofwork currently the responsibility of local authorities.This section also includes the Land Registry whosestaff, currently some 5,000, is forecast to increase by over 1,000 during the period due to increases in thenumbers of applications for the registration of land;under legislation, however, the Registry is likely tobe hived-off from the Civil Service during the next two years.
