ANNEXLOCAL DEFENCE COSTS IN GERMANYReport by OfficialsPR EGSNT POSIT IONOn 2nd January the Chancellor of the Exchequer reported to thePrime Minister that -&quot;Time is so pressing that it is necessary to startconsidering what the position will be if the Germanreply is unsatisfactory. &quot;2.        At the moment the posit on is governed by the statement made on 3rd December, 1957 to the Council of the Western European Union (V/.E.U.)and the North Atlantic Council as follows -&quot;Her Majestyrs Government are prepared to keep55,000 men in Germany until March 31, 1959 ifacceptable arrangements are made to meet their localcosts.   If, on the other hand, no satisfactory arrange-ments can be made Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be forced to reconsider afresh for reasons of externalfinance the whole question of the number of troopsallocated to N.A.T.O. which it will be possible forthem to locate outside the Sterling Area. &quot;3.        In their report, which will come before the North atlantic council next week, the three experts appointed by N.A.T.O. have givenus the certificate we sought about the validity of our balance of paymentscase.4. This paper examines, first, the military possibilities, second,the fina.ncial implication and third, the foreign political implications.FORCES IN GERMANY5.

In the long-term planning for the reduction of our forces, worldwide, to 375,000 regulars by the end of 1962, it has hitherto been assumed that the forces in Germany will be reduced to the following levels -BaAoOoR.5 Brigade Groups 44,900 men by 19632nd T AJ.102 Bomber and Recceaircraft 8,500 men by 1961
9. The Array target of 5 Brigade Groups in Germany in 1963 was based on the best assumptions then available about the reductions it ought to be possible to achieve in other parts of the world.   For this and other reasons it may be desirable, therefore, to consider the possi-bility of a further reduction of the Army in Germany to -4 Brigade Groups or about 35,000 men.10.      Although no firm plans for reduction in 1958/59 below 6 BrigadeGroups and 220 aircraft have been worked out, the following is a very rough first approximation of possible DM costs in 1958/59 on the basisof various strengths to be achieved by the end of the financial year(i.e. 31st March, 1959) -B.A.O.R. , 2nd T.A.F.Brigade   Strength        DM costs7 DM costsGroups   millions Aircraft        Strength          millionsS         63,500	45	220 UE	15,5006         52,000	36	102 UE	8,6004about35,000	32	Nil	Nil3         30,000	30		2          25,000	29		Nil          Nil	(?) 20		The strengths for 4 Brigade Groups and below are roughapproximations based on arbitrary assumptions about the ratesof withdrawal of administrative and supporting troops whichwould accompany the withdrawals of the Brigade groupsthemselves./ These figures assume a progressive withdrawal throughout theyear; e. g. if the number at the beginning of 1958/59 were63,500 and nil at the end, the average number to be supportedwould be about 30,000.11.       There is a considerable difference between -(a) accelerating the run down of our forces in Germany to say4 Brigade Groups and 102 aircraft, to the maximum extentcompatible with economy and with existing planning for thereduction of our forces to 375,000 by the end cf 1962;(b) a &quot;crash&quot; reduction of the forces in Germany to this levelby the end of 1958/59; and(c) a &quot;crash&quot; withdrawal of all our forces in Germany by theend of 1958/59.12.       Plans based on (b) or (c) are likely to entail a number ofconsequences which might prove unacceptable - e.g* the housing ofService personnel in unsatisfactory temporary accommodation, and difficult movement or financial problems.   These consequences have notbeen explored, but it is clear, however, that beyond an as yet undetermined
point a very rapid withdrawal would -(a) only secure really large savings after the end of1958/59; and(b) prejudice the efficiency and morale of the forces.In any case, the relief to the Budget from withdrawals from germany would be limited to the lov/er cost of maintaining the troops at homeinstead of in Germany s unless there were corresponding reductions inthe total size of the Army.FTNANCIAL IMPLICATIONS13,      The financial implications can be reduced to two points -(a) In default of a substantial German payment, in 1958/59,the additional burden on the Budget and on the balance of payments willbe large (see paragraph 9).   As regards the Budget, in 1957/53 the defenceburden on the British taxpayer was reduced from about  1,483 millions to about  1,420 millions as a result of the contributions received mainly from Germany.   Whatever the final outcome ofthe defence Estimates,this burden seems certain to be higher if there is no sizeable german contribution.    On the balance of payments, the current improvement inthe sterling/dollar rate must not be allowed to obscure the very large sums which have got to be repaid to the International Monetary fund and the Export/import Bank in the next year or eighteen months, the needfor earning a larger current surplus in order to enable us to do this aswell as to fortify the reserves, and the growing uncertainties about theworld economic situation in 1958 and 1959.   This background for thefuture, together with the experience of 1957, together show quite clearly that the additional burden (i. e. to replace the German contribution) ofthe order of  50 millions cannot be borne.(b) In judging what is practicable by way of withdrawal, we haveshown that the plans for reduction to 52,000 men (paragraph 5) or to55,000 men (paragraph 6) have been worked out in detail and we know that they could be put into operation in a practical way.   Reduction to lower levels has not been worked out in detail and their implications canonly be guessed at.   There would certainly be some considerable further savings by bigger withdrawals (paragraph 9) but there would also be greater practical difficulties than in the phased programmes which havealready been worked out.   They would also probably involve additionalexpenses in this country.POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS OF TROOP WITHDRAWALS14.      It is important as a matter of tactics not to forget that we hopethat the whole strategy of N0A0T.O, will shortly come under review.   Itis possible that agreement to maintain smaller shield forces may emerge.Nor can the possibility be excluded that some measure of &quot;disengagement&quot;might later be determined upon which would involve troop reductions, in kind, in numbers or in both, ixi an area which would presumably includeat least part of the German Federal Republic,   The conclusion from thisis that, whatever our eventual intentions, it would be unwise to show ourhand prematurely.   Outside events may do the work for us.   Thus we might attain cur end without odium.
15.       The choice between the different courses must depend to aconsiderable extent on how much money the Germans will contribute.We can expect almost anything between the two extremes, viz. -(i)        that the Germans would offer nothing, notwithstanding the rJ.A.T0Oo finding;(ii)        that they will offer to pay the whole sum (i. e. 50 millions).The extremes themselves are unlikely.   In between lie various possible german offers.   They might or might not be accompanied by e. g. offersto purchase arms, loan offers, etc.   Such an offer (say for example 20 millions plus other services) is the most likely thing.   We shouldhave to weigh such an offer very carefully, estimating the probablereaction of our Allies, before we embarked on any course ether thanplans in paragraphs 5 and 6 (i. e. 55,000 or 52,000 men).16.       Even the latter might draw a good deal of odium upon us andwe might not secure the acquiescence of our Allies,   In fact, anyrespectable German offer might be conditional upon our sticking to the concession already offered, i. e. not reducing below 55,000.17.       Thus, if the Germans made an offer such as that above, wecould not take a decision to go lower than, say, 50,000 consistently withmaintaining the goodwill of our Allies and we could expect them to argue that we were in breach of the Treaty.   If we persisted in this course,it is the view of the Foreign Office that there would be a very serious danger that this would strike a mortal blow to N.A.T.G. and Anglo/American co-operation.   At best we could not hope to avoid the followingconsequences -(a) a weakening of NA,T,0o;(b) the frustration of our plans under the heading ofinterdependence, balance of collective forces,political consultation, etc. ;(c) more European Six-Power activity, i. e, excluding the United Kingdom;(d) serious prejudice to the prospects for obtaining the free trade area;(e) an increase, especially in Germany, in the desireto make some sort of a political settlement withRussia.8th January, 195S
