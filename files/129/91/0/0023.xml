This shortage appears to beprincipally due to the loss of trained staff, over and above the marriage wastageto be expected in this type of profession, rather than to difficulties of recruitment.(With Treasury approval steps to improve recruitment were taken recently.)2. Present ScalesThe present scales, which range from  420 to  850, operate from5th November, 1956, and were awarded by the Industrial Court. It was anticipatedat the time that the Courfs award would be more favourable to radiographers,as a 15 per cent, shortage was admitted before the Court.3. The ProblemWe are satisfied that we should be fully justified in giving further increases in pay, in order to arrest and make good the shortage of radiographers, the effects ofwhich are described briefly in paragraph 5. The problem is to determine theminimum increases which can be expected to achieve that result.4. The Present ClaimIncreases of from  75 to  220 (11 per cent, to 38 per cent.) are now claimed,which would cost about  430,000 in a full year. We consider such increases to be greater than is justified by the facts or the object to be attained. In our view weshould offer increases ranging from just under 5 per cent, to just over 10 per cent.,at a cost of about  130,000 in a full year, and we believe it reasonable to hope thatthe claim could be settled for that. The offer would be unrelated to the cost ofliving. The sutnber of staff involved is about 4,000.5. Work of RadiographersRadiographers are employed on (i) diagnostic and (ii) therapeutic work.(i) X-rays are extensively used to diagnose conditions and to assess results of medical treatment or surgical operations. Nearly every branch ofmedicine is to some extent dependent on this diagnostic service.(ii) X-rays and other ionising radiations are increasingly used for thetreatment of many forms of cancer. For some forms there is no othersatisfactory treatment.A breakdown in the service resulting from a shortage of radiographers must therefore have serious effects on the diagnosis of injuries and diseases anatreatment of patients generally, with a prospect of longer stays in hospital and a^C.

less economical use of hospital beds, and in particular on the treatment of cancerpatients. We are informed that the point of breakdown has already been almostreached in some hospitals.6. Treasury view the Treasury have taken the view that this claim must be turned down inaccordance with the general economic policy of the Government, on inflationarywage claims, if necessary by our using our powers to disapprove a Whitleyagreement after warning both Management and Staff sides.7. View of Non-Departmental Members&apos;of the Management SideThe non-departmental members of the Management Side are unanimous that even in present economic circumstances the situation in hospitals is so serious andthe likelihood of collapse of this service, if pay is not improved, so great that substantial increases should be given. This view is fortified by comparison withthe pay of other medical auxiliaries.8. Consequence of Refusing any IncreaseWe are satisfied that, on merits, a substantial concession should be made.Quite apart from the merits, there are practical issues which cannot bs ignoredif our colleagues reach a contrary decision.   Either,(1) the Management Side might be persuaded- which we regard as unlikely to. reject the claim outright, on its merits in the context of the general economic situation. This would leave open the way to arbitrationbut we are doubtful whether the Staff Side would in fact obtain a&apos; substantial increase at arbitration, because the Industrial Court laiddown the present level of salaries a little over a year ago. rejection of the claim would therefore leave the difficulties of the service andthe possibility of breakdown unrelieved. Alternatively, and muchmore probably (2) the Management Side might be induced to reject the claim, but only on being told that we would not approve any increase and with the objectof leaving open the way to arbitration. In order to achieve this object,it would be necessary to give the Staff Side also advance notice of intention to disapprove. Any such action would inevitably attract. widespread publicity and attacks more violent than those provoked. . by our action in the case of the administrative, and clerical staff, havingregard to the different nature of the radiographers&apos; work and its more direct bearing on healing and the care of the sick.(3) It is by no means impossible that the Management Side might neverthelessmake an offer. If it were accepted by the Staff Side, we should then have actually to withhold approval. This would&apos; be presentationallyeven more- difficult than in the case of the clerks, and would lead torenewed allegations of the: unfairness of the Health procedure in the context of arbitration.9; Public Relations AspectWhichever way the decision goes,, we are faced with- a problem in. public relations.(1) Increases can properly be granted only if this case can be successfullydistinguished from that of the administrative and clerical: staff under-    1,200.  We recognise the presentational difficulty but we believe thatit can.  A pay increase for. radiographers could be presented as being necessary, in order to attract and,, still more, to retain, qualified1 staff inv the numbers, essential to the efficient running of the hospital service;      and. the treatment of cancer.   There Would be no question of./ f      .   compensating employees for..a rise in the cost-of-livihg and&apos;the increasegranted would be in no way comparable, with either the; cost-of-livingincrease refused to the administrative and clerical staffer with thosetj.    ..   . more, recently, gr.an.ted to. certain other classes of hospital staff.(2f), If5ion the other&apos;hand. ihcr^as^sWe^re refused by the. threat or - use of our: power. to* withhpld. approya),, we should.&apos; be&apos; clearly vulnerable- to the&apos; inevitable outcry; because of&apos; the; present&apos; dangerousr shortage1 -or^Statffand its link with the inadequacy of their pay.SECRETOCXS I
10. ConclusionWe therefore seek the agreement of the Cabinet to a substantial increase of pay though not as much as is claimed because:  (1) It is necessary for the efficient running of the hospital service and to avoid the real danger of a breakdown in an essential part of it; and(2) Our action, if properly and effectively presented, can be distinguished frominflationary pay concessions based on the cost-of-living and thus doesnot constitute a breach in the Government^ general economic policy.J.
