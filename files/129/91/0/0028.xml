Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1958C. (58) 28 Copy No.31st January, 1958CABINETAGRICULTURAL policy memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and food on 31st October, 1957, the Cabinet authorised us to introduce a Bill to repeal the disciplinary provisions of the Agriculture Acts, to modify the provisions relatingto security of tenure, and to clarify the instructions to farm rent arbitrators(C.C. (57) 77th Conclusions, Item 7). This decision was announced by the PrimeMinister in the Debate on the Address. Our colleagues may wish to know whatthe reaction has been.Repeal of Disciplinary Powers2. The National Farmers&apos; Union (N.F.U.) and other English organisationshave come out strongly against the repeal; so has the Opposition. All this we expected.3. The opposition of the N.F.U. seems to have been stimulated fromheadquarters, but is supported by all but one of the county branches. Their greatfear, despite very clear assurances to the contrary, is that repeal of the disciplinaryprovisions might lead to an attack on the system of price guarantees.4. The Country Landowners&apos; Association (C.L.A.), though not unanimous onthe subject, have given the N.F.U. their general support, partly no doubt out ofa feeling of loyalty to them and partly because they think the retention of thepowers might save them from land nationalisation proposals by a LabourAdministration in years to come.5. The Scottish Landowners&apos; Federation, and the Scottish branches of theLand Agents Society and the Institute of Chartered Surveyors, are ready to acceptthe repeal of Part II, but the Scottish N.F.U. are opposed to it.6. We discussed this proposal with our supporters in the House when theyreturned from their constituencies after the recess. Our backbenchers feel strongly that we should go ahead with this now and they do not expect ordinary farmers to react at all fiercely to the repeal.7. To sum up, there is a good deal of opposition to repeal, and this will certainly be reflected in the debates on the Bill. We do not think, however, thatthe feeling is at all strong among the general run of farmers and landowners.It is perhaps significant that even at the Annual General Meeting of the N.F.U.not a great deal was said about disciplinary powers; the subject was quiteovershadowed by the coming price review.8. The alternatives to repeal were thoroughly explored before the decision was taken last October. Nothing that has happened since justifies, in our view,reopening the matter. Moreover, we are committed to adopting therecommendations of the Franks Committee (Cmnd. 218). This means that wecannot leave things as they are. We must in any case legislate on procedure,and this will open up the whole question.52934THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA3 STY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
Security of Tenure9. Last autumn the N.F.U. and C.L.A. reached agreement on a formula to relax the present over-rigid provision. This we propose to adopt as a basisof legislation, and we believe we shall very shortly achieve complete and final agreement on a detailed draft suitable for incorporation in legislation.10. We also intend to bring the Scottish law on succession to and bequestof tenancies broadly into line with the position in England; the Scottish N.F.U.are strongly resisting this proposal.Rental Arbitrations11. We propose to instruct farm rent arbitrators that an award should bebased on open market values. This will encounter some opposition from theN.F.U., who are trying to get action on this delayed. But they cannot really objectstrongly to rents being based on market values. The C.L.A. attach greatimportance to this change; and we are convinced that it is essential if we are tomaintain a satisfactory landlord-tenant system.Tenants&apos; Rights12. The provisions on the security of tenure and rental arbitrations may appear to favour the landlord against the tenant farmer. We are considering whether there are any provisions favouring the tenant, including strengthening his present rights to secure essential fixed equipment from a landlord who refuses toprovide it, which it would be reasonable to include in the Bill.Conclusion13. After considering the reactions, we still believe that we should go ahead with our proposals.J. S. M.J. H.30th January, 1958.
