secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER RRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1958C. (58) 321st February, 1958Copy No.CABINETTHE AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY AND THE BRITISH EUROPEAN AIRWAYSFor the last six months I have, with Cabinet concurrence, been seeking a strengthening of units in the aircraft industry, with two ends in view:  (i) to enhance their ability to compete with the much more powerfulAmerican units, this being the indispensable condition of their futuresuccess in the civil aircraft field;(ii) to relieve the heavy dependence which they have shown over the last twelve years on Exchequer finance, a dependence stemming from theirown individual weakness.2. To have pursued this policy through mere exhortation would have beenprofitless; to have resorted to compulsion would have been undesirable, andimpossible without legislation; the only other course was to use the power of contract. In the military field there are no new contracts in prospect; in the civilfield there is only one the new British European Airways (B.E.A.) need for jet aircraft. Here the placer of the contract is not the Government, but B.E.A.; thefinance required for the contract comes, however, from the Government and inother respects the implications for the Government are profound.3.   The firms originally tendering for the contract were:  A. V. Roe (a subsidiary of Hawker-Siddeley), offering an aircraft with aRolls-Royce engine still to be developed;Bristol, offering an already developed Bristol engine;de Havilland, offering the new Rolls-Royce engine.After having displayed an initial preference for Bristol. B.E.A. switched tode Havilland, largely, it would appear, on the ground of the new Rolls engine.4. I was invited accordingly to negotiate with Rolls-Royce and de Havillandthe financial terms on which they were prepared to meet the requirement. Iimmediately found myself in the difficulty that, while Bristol and A. V. Roe didnot seek Government money, Rolls-Royce and de Havilland did. I stipulated thatno Government money should be made available for the development of eitherengine or air-frame. Rolls-Royce quickly accepted this stipulation, de Havilland,after having rejected overtures for a merger made to them by Hawker Siddeley,accepted the stipulation in a series of proposals the latest of which is a company to undertake the project, with capital and work in the following proportions:  5. Meanwhile Hawker Siddeley and Bristol had come together at an early stage to propose a joint company with capital in the proportions of: 1Per cent.Memorandum by the Minister of SupplyPer cent.de HavillandHunting ...Fairey67iHawker Siddeley ...Bristol     ......653552952
The Company would manufacture the aircraft with the new Rolls engine,though the developed Bristol engine would be offered to foreign customers if they desired it. The Bristol design team would remain in charge for the first year orfor any other length of time that B.E.A. might wish to specify in the contract.Rolls-Royce have undertake^ to do the power plant on equal terms for either group.6. There are thus two contenders for the project and there are three criteriato be applied to their offers. First, technical ability to meet B.E.A.&apos;s requirement of twenty-four aircraft, delivery to begin in 1964. Either group should be ableto do this, and there is nothing to choose between them.7. Secondly, future capacity to compete in the world civil aircraft marketwith the least possible call on Exchequer finance. A decisive advantage wouldseem to reside here with the Hawker-Bristol combination for the following reasons:  (i) The Hawker-Bristol group, alone among British airframe constructors,would come within distance of matching the strength of the presentAmerican corporations (see annex). The position of the HawkerCompany as the third largest industrial group in Canada and the largestaeronautical group there would add substantially to the resulting ability to penetrate the American market.(ii) The aircraft work of a Hawker-Bristol combination would form but partof a widely diversified industrial structure, on the strength of the wholeof which credit could be more easily raised than for the more speculativepurpose of aircraft, thus diminishing the call on Government finance.(iii) The Hawker Company are far and away the largest private possessor ofaeronautical testing and experimental facilities in this country. It is highly desirable that these should be harnessed to large-scale civil aircraft. If this harnessing cannot come about in relation to the presentrequirement, I do not see how it can come about, and the policy ofsecuring the maximum amount of research work on private accountas against Government account will be stultified.8. Thirdly, ability to export to foreign air lines an aircraft of roughly thekind desired by B.E.A., though not necessarily exactly the same. This is important,for the number of aircraft desired by B.E.A. twenty-four is uneconomic fromthe point of view of the constructor; eighty would need to be manufactured toallow the constructor to break even and 120 to make a reasonable profit.9. Pan-American Airlines (P.A.A.) are seeking an aircraft somewhat similarto that sought by B.E.A. and are in negotiation with Hawker-Bristol, who areprepared to deliver in advance of delivery to B.E.A. de Havilland have anagreement with B.E.A. by which they do not seek to sell abroad without firstsigning a contract with B.E.A. P.A.A. are a more influential airline than B.E.A.,and are likely to determine the pattern of world demand, Koninklijke LuchtvaartMaatschappij and Scandinavian Airlines System following suit. The questiontherefore is: which is the more likely to secure a P.A.A. order Hawker-Bristol orde Havilland?10. This is a difficult question, but I would rate the chances of Hawker-Bristolhigher for these reasons:  (i) P.A.A. desire the aircraft in 1963, B.E.A. in 1964.   Indeed P.A.A areinsistent that they must be the first to operate the new aircraft.Hawker-Bristol are the more likely to satisfy the P.A.A. demand,particularly since it can be met only with the already developed Bristolengine.(ii) P.A.A.&apos;s specifications for the aircraft differ from B.E.A.&apos;s.  By hitchingthemselves first to B.E.A., de Havilland have made more difficult theiradjustment to the probable world requirement.(iii) P.A.A. are likely to buy British only if they see behind the aircraft a technical and producing organisation comparable to the strongAmerican organisations. If Hawker-Bristol cannot satisfy them onthis score, it is unlikely that de Havilland can. It is probable in that case that P.A.A. will turn to an American producer, who will be ableto outstrip in speed of production anything that de Havilland can offer.
11. In short, while either Hawker-Bristol or de Havilland could equally wellmeet the B.E.A. requirement, an advantage in the export of the aircraft seems to lie with Hawker-Bristol and an overwhelming advantage lies with them in promisefor the future of civil aircraft production. B.E.A., however, have expressed a wishto place the order with de Havilland, and the question for the Government is whether, in this predicament, they should give their consent to the investment of 30 millions by B.E.A. in new aircraft.12. If, as is suggested by the Minister of Civil Aviation, permission is givento B.E.A. to invest in the de Havilland aircraft, the decision will in my judgmentcarry the following implications:  (i) There will be a strong risk that the aircraft will not be an export, andtherefore commercial, success. The real. return obtainable on the investment would in that case be less than that obtainable by investmentelsewhere. And financial loss would carry with it risk of call on theGovernment for help.(ii) We shall have given our blessing to a weaker organisation as against a stronger. We are only too likely to see continued therefore our post-warhistory of seeking the prizes that are obtainable in the field of civil aircraft but without an industrial organisation capable of realising them.For my part I believe that Government effort and government expenditure in relation to civil aircraft are worthwhile, but not if weare unable to fashion the appropriate industrial instrument.(iii) We shall have exposed the deficiencies of our policy of securing anadequate strengthening of industry by the mere use of the power of contract.  We shall therefore be in a weak position to resist other androugher measures for reorganising it, particularly nationalisation.In the light of these considerations I recommend that the B.E.A. purchaseof the de Havilland aircraft be disallowed.13. I recommend even more strongly that no authority to buy thede Havilland aircraft be announced on Wednesday next, as requested by theMinister of Civil Aviation. If this request is granted I venture to suggest that theGovernment risk making themselves look foolish. The Hawker-Bristol talks with.A.A. are proceeding exceptionally well and a contract is in preparation. It islikely to be signed shortly, possibly within a few days. If such a signature were announced after the Government had given authority to B.E.A. for the purchaseof the de Havilland aircraft, it would be seen that B.E.A. had expressed a wrongjudgment, that the Government, despite earlier inclinations to the contrary, hadendorsed that judgment, but that the world was taking a different view. Further,to have both a B.E.A. order with de Havilland and a P.A.A. order with Hawker-Bristol would be to invite an internecine struggle for the export market between two British rival aircraft and organisations. One or other or both would fail tomake a commercial success of their projects and might turn to the Governmentfor financial help. The overwhelming national interest lies in the securing of theP.A.A. contract; if it is indeed won, B.E.A. would be less than patriotic if they didnot follow the P.A.A. lead.14. Finally, I would draw attention to the genesis of this story the selectionby B.E.A of a preference and the negotiation by myself of the terms on which thepreference could be met. Much has been said in Press comment on this subjectof the customers freedom of choice. In the true commercial world the customerremains neutral as between one supplier and another until the terms are fullyknown. Here, however, the customer opted prematurely, before the terms were known. He was able to do so because the terms and the financial implications arethe prime concern of the Government. The principle of freedom of consumerschoice is in this instance subject to much qualification. There is a double interest B.E.A.&apos;s and the Governments which requires that they should work in partnership. Unless opportunity is taken of this episode to bring home to the nationalised airline corporations this need for partnership, I am afraid I see littlefuture for the civil aircraft industry in this country.A.
