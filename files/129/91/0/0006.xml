G OVERNMENT expenditure UR EMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in the letter which the Prime Minister wrote on 6th january to the former Chancellor of the Exchequer he stated that -&quot;The Cabinet decided to pursue by every possible means the policy of keeping Government expendituresubstantially the same as last year. &quot;The &quot;words &quot;last year&quot; refer - as is shown by an earlier passage in theletter - to the current financial year.2.         The letter went on to say that the Cabinet, as a result of their work together, were able to reduce the excess of expenditure for theforthcoming year over that of the current year to &quot;something less thanone per cent of the total of current Government expenditure&quot;.3.         I suggest that in our utterances we should be at pains to avoid any confusion about what is meant by these various references to expenditure in the two years.   The one per cent (which was intended bythe Prime Minister to indicate an order of magnitude) was one per cent of the total of Government expenditure for this year including expenditure from the Consolidated Fund as v/ell as expenditure from Votes; and oneper cent of this total is in fact about  50 millions.   But this total ofexpenditure has no significance for present purposes apart from its usein this assessment of the one per cent.4.        The gap v/ith which the Cabinet have been, and are, concerned is that between the Parliamentary Estimates for the two years, i.e. -(a) for the current year, the total of all Estimates,original as revised, and Supplementary Estimatesalready presented and to be presented; and(b) for the forthcoming year, the total of the original estimates only.We must remember that the actual expenditure in the current year will bewell below the total at (a) above.   At the present time, however, we canonly proceed on the basis of the total Estimates; and a comparison later on between the actual expenditure for this year with the Estimates for nextyear would produce a much larger gap0   So too would a comparison which included all Government expenditure above the line, Consolidated Fundservices as well as Supply Services.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HI R BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTThe circulation oi thi  pare- has been strictly limited.h is -issued for the persona! use of.......-----......-------- rTOP SECRET Copy No.S?-L-C.(58) 610th January, 1958CABINET
5.         I suggest, therefore, that in any references to this matter weshould continue to stick to the comparison in (a) and (b) above and thatwe should refer always to &quot;Estimates&quot; for the two years rather than to&quot;expenditure&quot;.   If we use the expression &quot;Parliamentary Estimates&quot;,or are careful in writing to spell &quot;Estimates&quot; with a capital E, this will help to direct attention to what we are in fact talking about, which isParliamentary Votes,6.        If it is necessary to refer to possible reductions in Social service estimates, it might, I suggest, be best to say that sudden and insufficientlyconsidered action in relation to the social services might well have the opposite effect to what we intend by withholding help from those who need it, and so offend against the nation&apos;s sense of social justice.   By doingthat we should undermine the general willingness to show restraint uponwhich success in the campaign against inflation depends.D.H.A.Treasury Chambers, S0W.l.9th January, 1953-2-
