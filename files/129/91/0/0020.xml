LONDON BUS dispute memorandum by the Minister of transport and Civil aviation agree with the Minister of Labour&apos;s paper on thisquestion (C.(58)17) but I think my colleagues should also considercertain other vitally important issues which flow from it.2. We have said that while firmly pursuing our policy of controlling inflation, we will not interfere with the normal processes of collective bargaining, and that we would accept in the public sector the results of arbitration.3. In my own sphere I have tried to prevent inflationaryeffects from any wage increases by insisting that the British transport commission (B.T.C.) including the Liondon Transport Executive (L.T.E.)must absorb, as far as is humanly possible, any increase given by arbitration by cuts in services and man-power so that it does not result in an increase in fares and charges.4. We must decide whether this doctrine is still accepted as fulfilling the requirements of Government economic policy.   In other words, that a gay increase is not inflationary if it is covered either by increased productivity and efficiency or alternatively by cuts in services or man-power so that as a result there is no increase in cost to the consumer.   If this remains our policy we should examineits effect on the issue facing us.5. Any recommendation which the Committee might makewould of course not be binding on either party.   But however we present it, it will appear to the public to be an arbitration award.   If the worsthappens and the recommendation is acceptable to the unions, and of a kind which the L.T.E. felt they could not in reason reject, it could probably be implemented without cost to the consumer by cuts in bus services in London.   If we are then to act consistently with our declared policy, we should have no reason for directing the L.T.E. to decline to pay up.    For us to try to do so at that stage would make nonsenseof our agreement to set up the committee in the first place.-1-THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of.........-------------------------TOP SECRET Copy No.--TT?L.C.

6. I think we must be quite clear, however, at this criticalstage in the wage situation whether we mean to try to go further than this and say that no wage increases at all should be granted evenif recommended by this committee.    In this case the unions might saythat we were overthrowing not only this committee but all forms of collective bargaining include ng arbitration in a nationalised industry.H0wever, if this is the position which we wish to hold, and if thecommittee is set up, then of course I must at some stage give apublic direction to the E.T.E. that whatever the results of thiscommittee may be they are not to pay any wages increase.    This mightplace the Government in so difficult a position that it would be better not to set up the committee.H.W.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1.23rd January, 1958-2-
