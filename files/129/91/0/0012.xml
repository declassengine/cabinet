SECRET..THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1958C. (58) 12 Copy No.20th January, 1958CABINETTHE HIGH COMMISSION TERRITORIES IN SOUTH africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations the General Election in South Africa, which is expected to take place late in April, may create new tensions in the relations between the nationalist government and the United Kingdom. Among the issues which may provideNationalist leaders with the raw material for extreme statements designed to attract the Afrikaner vote is the future of the High Commission Territories. two matters with regard to these are under discussion between South Africa and ourselves and could be &quot; blown up &quot; for election purposes to proportions which,however unjustifiable, might cause us a good deal of trouble.  These are:  (a) The development of minerals and railway communications in Swaziland.(b) Defence facilities for Union forces in Bechuanaland and Basutoland.This first subject may also involve decisions which may cause some controversywith a section of the Conservative Party in the House of Commons in additionto the Opposition, although for different reasons. I have thought it right to circulate the annexed memorandum for the information of my colleagues so thatthey may be aware of the nature of the issues at stake.H.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,20th January, 1958.52877b
ANNEXMEMORANDUMSWAZILAND IRON ORE AND PROPOSALS FOR RAILWAYS INSWAZILAND1. Extensive deposits of iron ore of good quality have been discovered atBomvu Ridge in north-west Swaziland and two concerns have applied to theHigh Commissioner for prospecting rights with the option of mining rights. Onegroup is represented by the Power Securities Corporation and consists of certainUnited Kingdom interest, i.e., Balfour Beatty and Company, Ltd., BritishThomson-Houston and European and African Sales, Ltd., in association withJohannesburg Consolidated Investments Ltd.; the other, Swaziland Iron OreDevelopment Company Limited, is a company registered in Swaziland which hasbeen formed by the Anglo-American Corporation of South Africa Ltd. and Guest,Keen and Nettlefolds, Ltd.; this Company&apos;s application will supersede proposalsalready made by its parent, Anglo-American.2. It is common ground that the deposits cannot be exploited without a railway to carry the ore to a port. Originally it was assumed that this railwayshould run to the eastern border of Swaziland to connect with the Portugueserailway joining Goba in Portuguese East Africa to the port of Lourenco Marques.The High Commissioner in April 1957 informed the Union Government that his mind was turning in that direction. In June he received a reply from the UnionGovernment proposing that the Government-owned South African railways should construct and operate a railway across- Swaziland from the Transvaalto a port to be built at Sordwana Bay on the Natal coast, north of Durban. TheUnion Government were prepared to provide the money for the whole of theconstruction. I discussed this proposal with the Prime Minister and certain other of my colleagues and decided that it was essential for the Swaziland Governmentto own that portion of the railway lying within Swaziland; the cost of constructionof this portion has been estimated at  7-6 millions.3. Anglo-American have made a firm offer of the necessary finance for therailway on terms which are reasonable. Their offer is conditional on their being given the iron ore concession but stands irrespective of the outcome of the provingof the deposits. They have also undertaken that, in the event of the trans-Swaziland railway not being built, they will &quot; explore the possibility of arranging the finance for a railway from Goba.&quot; Satisfactory conditions can be made tosecure that South Africa&apos;s native policy does not intrude into Swaziland. The HighCommissioner has expressed the view that the readiness of the group with whichAnglo-American are associated to provide railway finance gives them a decidedadvantage over their competitors. I and my advisers agree that they are the more practical of the two applicants and the more likely to contribute to the developmentof Swaziland. It is true that the Power Securities group have more numerousrepresentatives of United Kingdom industry and trade as against the singleimportant United Kingdom company which is associated with Anglo-American.On the other hand, Johannesburg Consolidated, who are also participants in thePower Securities group, and would conduct the iron ore operations, represent asubstantial Union interest. Anglo-American have associated themselves for theprospecting and exploitation of the iron ore with Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds; theyare also in touch with the Commonwealth Development and Finance Corporationwho are considering putting up  1 million towards the finance of the railway. Boththe iron ore company and the railway loan will therefore have a considerableUnited Kingdom content.4. These considerations have influenced me to accept the High Commissioner^recommendation that the concession should be granted to the group formed byAnglo-American and Guest, Keen and Nettlefolds.52877
5. Before the South African Government will declare a firm decision on the trans-Swaziland railway they will have to survey and analyse potential traffic andit will be necessary that the iron ore deposits should be commercially proved inorder to show how much traffic they will generate. This means that the prospectinglicence must be awarded in the very near future, since the process of proving may take up to eighteen months. Even if there is some doubt about the railway atpresent I see no reason to depart from my view that the concession shouldbe awarded to the Swaziland Iron Ore Development Company. Discussions have begun, without formal commitment, with Anglo-American on the drafts of the relevant documents. The decision in principle to award the concession to theSwaziland Iron Ore Development Company has not been communicated either toAnglo-American or to Power Securities.6. Critics in or out of Parliament may suggest that this is the thin end of thewedge to extend South African influence in Swaziland. I think we must risk this as we would not be justified in turning down an offer which may mean so much in development to the future of that country.Defence Facilities for the Union in the High Commission Territories7. In September 1957, Mr. Erasmus, the Union Minister of Defence, visitedLondon at his own request and, in the course of discussion with Lord Mancroft,acting for the Minister of Defence, pressed with emphasis and at length the questionof the High Commission Territories. He made various requests, most of whichhad so little military justification, that we could only infer that his purpose waseither to score a personal success by extending Union influence into the Territories,or alternatively if his requests should be refused by the United KingdomGovernment, to enable him to reinforce the standing pressure for transfer of the territories by arguing that United Kingdom control of them was a hindrance tothe Union&apos;s defence needs. After further more detailed discussions between mr. Erasmus and the High Commissioner in Pretoria in October and November1957, they agreed to make the following five recommendations to their governments.  We have been informed that the Union Government accept them.(a) South African Air Force, Government-owned and Government-charteredaircraft should have the right to fly over the three Territories without first seeking permission to do so and to inspect existing airstrips in the bechuanaland Protectorate, accompanied by a member of the high commissioners staff.(b) The High Commissioner should retain the right to ask for changes in the composition and the ranks of Union military parties visiting the territories on duty; and to ask them to travel in plain clothes.(c) The Union Defence Force should have the right to pass through a smallcorner of Basutoland territory in transit to a radar site on Union soilon the Basutoland border (access from the Union being apparentlydifficult).(d) The Union have the right, in the event of an emergency arising inSouth-West Africa, to send military vehicles by a defined route acrossthe Bechuanaland Protectorate and for this purpose to make a preliminary reconnaissance of the route, the party to be accompaniedby members of the High Commissioner^ staff.(e) In view cf the intention of the Union Government to establish a permanenttropical training centre in the Caprivi strip the Union Governmentshould have the right of access overland across the bechuanaland protectorate. This would involve a preliminary reconnaissance party of about six vehicles, a convoy of about fifty vehicles to set up theschool and the right to replace worn out vehicles along this route andto reconnoitre it annually. The route proposed passes through the bechuanaland Protectorate for about 450 to 500 miles.8. I have given much thought to these recommendations, and to their implications. In the result I propose to accept (a) which is reasonable. Theformula at (b) represents a retreat by the Union in which Mr. Erasmus onlyreluctantly acquiesced; at the same time the High Commissioner has said that hewill only exercise his right in exceptional cases. In the circumstances I proposeto agree. The recommendation at (c) may provoke comment in this country, butthe Paramount Chief Regent of the Basuto has consented, which should enable us
to reply to critics. I should also point out that this too represents a retreat by theUnion; Mr. Erasmus pressed to be allowed to survey sites for a radar station inBasutoland itself, but this was firmly resisted by the High Commissioner. In thecircumstances I am prepared to accept it. The recommendation at (cl) concernstransit across a sparsely-inhabited area and I am prepared to agree. If we ourselveswant to send troops or police to deal with an emergency in one of the high commission Territories the most convenient way overland is through UnionTerritory and for Basutoland there is no other way.9. The recommendation at (e) for transit rights to the Caprivi strip is muchmore questionable. Prima facie it appears to be a once-for-all operation, whichwould not be so very objectionable; but clearly it would be impossible to refuse a request arising subsequently. I have little doubt that the reason why the Uniondefence authorities have said that they have decided to establish a tropical training centre in the eastern part of the Caprivi strip is to establish a basis for requestingthe right to run military convoys over Bechuanaland, since access to the strip from south-West Africa is both circuitous and difficult. The route proposed is between450 and 500 miles long, so that the convoys would spend some time in making the transit, and the Union authorities have indicated that a journey of this distancewould provide practice in driving in difficult desert conditions. The passage of units of the Union Defence Forces over such a long route through the Protectoratewould, in my view, make a deplorable impression on the bechuanaland. Although thenorthern part of the route is comparatively uninhabited, the southern part passesthrough the Bamangwato Reserve. The Bamangwato are quiet and content at themoment, but this is a sensitive area. I propose therefore that this request shouldbe refused.10. The High Commissioner, whom I have consulted, does not disagree with my assessment, but points out that there is a danger of the Union Governmentseizing on a refusal of the request as a pretext for picking a quarrel with the UnitedKingdom Government over the Territories. He also thinks that they might takevarious actions against them such as denouncing the 1910 Customs Agreement orrequiring us to remove the Headquarters of the Bechuanaland Protectorateadministration from Mafeking. Such action would be seriously embarrassingeconomically and would involve substantial expense. No retaliatory action is opento the Territories. It cannot be overlooked that the economies of the territories are dependent on the Union of South Africa, with which they have been, since 1910,in a Customs Union. It may be that this warning is pessimistic; nor do I wish tosuggest that we should, in our administration of the Territories, be swayed by fears of possible Union action; but it is right to reckon with the possible consequences.11. I am asking the High Commissioner to consider whether a modificationof the Union proposal would be acceptable. The rational method of obtainingaccess to the eastern Caprivi strip would be by rail through the bechuanaland protectorate and Southern Rhodesia to a point south of Victoria Falls, and thenwestwards by road. This road runs for about 40 miles through Southern rhodesia and about 10 miles through the Bechuanaland Protectorate, but I should beprepared for this since the area in question is Crown land, not a Native Reserve,and almost uninhabited. Transit by rail is much less objectionable than acrosscountry; it is relevant that the Bechuanaland railway is operated by South AfricanRailways as far as the Rhodesian border. It may be doubted whether thissuggestion will satisfy Mr. Erasmus, if his heart is set on parading the Union&apos;military might through as much of the Bechuanaland Protectorate as possible; itmay, however, serve to keep negotiations going until after the General Election.12. I thought my colleagues would like to be aware of these two matters.The problem of defence facilities contains obvious material for exploitation bySouth African spokesmen. The Power Securities Corporation has a number ofsupporters in the Conservative Party and the impact of a major mining venturecombined with an extensive railway system will make a big impact upon the Swazisthe significance of which will not be lost upon the Opposition. Nevertheless, Ithink it is wise to proceed as I have proposed.AnnexesMap of the Bechuanaland Protectorate.Plan of Proposed Railway Routes in Swaziland.
