TEXT OF DRAFT REPLY TOMR. BULGANIN&apos;S LETTER TO THEPRIME MINISTER OF 11TH DECEMBER, 1957My colleagues and I have been studying your letter.which was delivered to me on 11th December.   Although I have now received yourfurther letter dated 8th January I feel sure that you would not wish meto delay my reply to your earlier letter.   V/e shall, of course, also givecareful consideration to the views expressed in your second letter.2.        The British Government naturally share the desire of theSoviet Government to improve the international situation and developbetter relations between the two countries.   V/e emphatically endorse the view that the preservation of peace ought in times like these to bethe first objective of every civilised Government.   That is the heartfeltdesire of the British people and the sincere aim of the BritishGovernment.   I can assure you most solemnly that no British Governmentwill ever commit, take part in or condone an act of aggression againstthe Soviet Union.   That was the purport of my reference in a broadcast on 4th January to a pact of non-aggression.   This concept is, of course,inherent in the Charter of the United Nations.   Nevertheless I nowsolemnly repeat this assurance.   It was because I thought that such an assurance might be useful at the present time that I made referenceto it in my broadcast.   The form of any bilateral or multilateraldeclaration will of course require further consideration since our purpose must be to reinforce and not to cast doubt upon the existing provision of the United Nations Charter.   But as I went on to say in mybroadcast peace cannot be secured just by words:   we need deeds as well.We need also to understand one another correctly and not to labour undermisapprehensions on either side.   For this reason I was sorry to seerepeated in your letter a number of statements about the policy of theUnited Kingdom Government and about the character and purpose of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation which are not justified by the facts.Although I do not think that much would be gained by a public argumentabout these points I must call attention to some of these mis-statements which if allowed to pass without comment might be likely to gain credence.You asserted, for example, that the Federal German Republic was to begiven the opportunity to produce atomic and hydrogen weapons and thatthe disarmament talks had been frustrated because the Western powers had tried to impose unacceptable conditions on the Soviet Union.   As iswell known, there is no justification for either of these statements.3.        I much regret that your letter seems to ignore a great manyconstructive proposals which we and our associates have put forward with the aim of reducing tension.   For example, you say nothing about theDraft Outline Treaty of Assurance which we offered in Geneva in 1955.Nor do you say anything about our plan for partial disarmament whichwas recently endorsed by a two-thirds majority of the United Nations.It could hardly be disputed that an agreement based on this plan would bring untold benefits to the world.   Unfortunately, your Government has so far declined to recognise the plan even as a basis of further negotiation.   Indeed your representatives have consistently rejected our
SECRET t* r*t. hefforts to come down to the hard practical facts of disarmament.   Couldyou not take up our repeated offers to set groups of experts at work onthe technical details of disarmament, especially the problems ofverifying and controlling the measures which you or we have proposed?For after all the practical aspects of these problems remain largelyunexplored.   For example, you agree to control over a suspension of nuclear tests and to the principle of air and ground inspection againstsurprise attack.   Why could we not start at once to work out how these,and other essential controls, should operate in practice?&apos; I cannot under-stand why we should not make such a beginning.   For after all, if dis-armament is really to help re-establish a proper sense of confidencebetween countries, it must consist of measures whose execution can be observed, checked and enforced.   This is what is needed to create realconfidence and this is what we on our side want.4.        Your letter, although passing over our proposals in silence,contains a number of concrete suggestions.   With one exception, allthese have been put forward and discussed before.   Progress has, infact, been made on some of them, particularly in the sphere of Anglo-Soviet cultural and commercial relations.   If it has not been possible tomake progress on some others I honestly feel that this has not been ourfault.   I am also grieved that your letter of 11th December does notmention the subject of German re-unification although this remains anessential condition of European security.5.        The suggestion that is new is that an agreement should be negotiated between the powers possessing nuclear weapons to the effectthat no such weapons should be produced or stationed on the territories of Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia.   This suggestion, which hasalready been put forward by the Polish Government, is ojjen to certainobvious objections, but the British Government are studying it with a viewto seeing whether there are elements in it which could be made thebasis of some alternative proposal.6.        Towards the end of your letter you say that personal contacts between Soviet statesmen and Western statesmen could in your viewcontribute greatly towards the achievement of mutual understanding.I agree that such meetings do have their part to play in reaching the settlements we all desire.   You v/ill no doubt have noticed in this connexion that in the communique published at the end of their recent meeting the North Atlantic Council recorded their willingness to promote,preferably within the framework of the United Nations, any negotiationswith the Soviet Union likely to lead to the implementation of thedisarmament proposals endorsed by a large majority of the general assembly of the United Nations in November.   The North Atlantic Councilstated that they were also prepared to examine any proposal from what-ever source for general or partial disarmament and any proposalenabling agreement to be reached on the controlled reduction of arma-ments of all types.   Finally, they declared that if the Soviet Governmentrefused to participate in the work of the new Disarmament Commissionthey would welcome a meeting at Foreign Ministers level to resolve the deadlock.   I think it right to remind you of these proposals especially the last.   I must frankly say that I feel that a meeting of this character,itself carefully prepared, is necessary if we are to make real progress.
7.         In your letter of 8th January you made some proposals withregard to a meeting of Heads of Governments.   I am considering theseproposals.   We must not forget that much would be expected by the worldfrom such a meeting and failure or disappointment would be correspon-dingly grave.   This subject is however treated at some length in yoursecond letter and you will perhaps allow me to revert to it when I replyto that letter.
