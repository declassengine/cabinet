THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of........--------------------TOP SECRET Copy No-jL.C.(5S) 101 3th January, 1958CABINETESTIMATES, 1958/59Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the speeches which our former colleagues have made since their resignation have strengthened the initial impression that theGovernment are weakening and compromising in the tough anti-inflationaryline adopted last September.   They have in fact implicitly charged us with exactly this.   In particular it has been implied that an insufficientlytough line has been taken with defence cuts and that expenditure on thesocial services has been regarded as sacrosanct.2.      V7e must prove these allegations groundless or our policies willcrash and the support of our party with them.3.      How in the circumstances can we do this?   I believe that, withthe final cuts which are now being urgently discussed, we can defend theaggregate Defence Estimates.   The announcement of big pay increases forthe Forces will be extremely av/kward but probably not unmanageable.   ButI regard it as essential that in putting forward the Estimates we should prove that there is no substance in the charge that we have exempted thefield of social service expenditure.   V/e must show that we have been toughin this field too - but selectively tough.   What are the alternatives ?(a)   The Minister of Education has offered me another  1 million.I do not believe there are any further substantial economiestc be achieved here.   The reasons for the increase in these estimates are self-evident.(b) The Cabinet decided against alterations in the family allowances scheme.(c) There are the Welfare services - school meals, school milk,welfare milk, etc.   Increased charges would produce worth-while savings;  but it would not be easy to reconcile themwith the terms of the Prime Ministers letter to the formerChancellor and such cute would enable it to be said that wehad after all been obliged to adopt the views expressed by ourformer colleagues.(a)   There are possible increases in health charges.   The Cabinetthought these undesirable,   And they have the disadvantagethat they hit those in trouble.-1-
(e)    Finally there is a transfer of a further slice of expenditureon the Health Service to the stamp.   The present proportionof the total gross cost represented by the various charges and the stamp combined is about 16 per cent.   (Beveridgesuggested 20 per cent as a reasonable proportion for thestamp - charges not then being in the picture.)   Theremaining cost falling on general taxation in the estimates for the coming year (after allowing for rate-borne expenditurand receipts from superannuation contributions) is 555 millions.   After allowing for the increased revenue from the higher stamp enforced last autumn for a full year the National Health Service Estimates v/ill be up by about 10 millions on this year&apos;s total Estimates.4.      When I last reported to the Cabinet the gap stood at  97 millions on the basis of firm decisions, with further probable reductions in prospecwhich enabled me to assess it at &quot;about  90 millions&quot;.   As a result offirm changes during the last few days it now stands at  82 millions.(Of the reduction cf  15 millions, about  7 millions is due to increasedSupplementary Estimates for this year;  the position is spelt out in more detail in Annex A.)   Further changes will, I hope, be apparent by the time we meet, particularly as regards the provision for Malta and the requestI have just made to the Ministers concerned for further reductions in research and development both defence and civil.   Apart from these theresnay be as much as  3 millions or so still to be got in various minorreductions still being pursued Departmentally.5.      It looks to me as if on present figures, which are set out in annex B, something like 1 Od. on the stamp will be required if we are tobridge our gap honestly.   If further Departmental savings can be securedwe might be able to make do with Id. or 2d. less.6.      I set out in a separate paper (C.(5C) 11) some considerationsrelating to the financing of the National Insurance Fund deficit by borrowinI am convinced that if we used this device in order to get down to a &quot;gap&quot;of no more than  50 millions (and it would be discovered at some stage that the former Chancellor had not agreed to this) we should be accused,and I think rightly, of weak wangling for purely presentational purposes,D.H.A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.18th January, 1958

In factit was, on the basis of decisions then taken, about  98 millions.This difference of  23 millions is accounted for partly by the 16 millions which results from taking the Service Estimatesnet of foreign aid, and partly by the fact that the  40 millionsreductions were assumed as firm whereas in fact only about 33 millions had then been offered.Since then the following changes have occurred:-  millionsapproximate LyAs at 7th January, 1958 98Net increases in this year&apos;s supplementary estimates (mainly in Defence Budget) net reductions in next year&apos;s Estimates(i)    due to recalculation on later information ft9 on National insurance fund deficit, offset by others, mainlyExchequer Equalisation Grant) 4(ii)    due to economy cuts, offset by afew increases 7IsLess   correction of error due to rounding  net total reduction in the gap 1 6As at ICth January, 1958-3-

No account is taken, in the figures of yield, of tax loss onemployer&apos;s share.   V/e lose about  2 millions of revenue (notreflected in Votes) for every Id. added to the employer&apos;s share.2. The percentages in the last column relate to charges and stampput together. The yield of the stamp alone would come to wellunder 20 per cent in all cases.3. Moreover the percentages are based on a full year&apos;s yield fromthe various possible additions to the stamp.   If the yield nextyear were used instead the percentages would be lower.   (Inthe case of a lOd. increase from 1st July the percentage - takingstamp and charges together - would be about 20. 1 next year:  thepercentage in the first full year - 1959/60 - depends of course on what the cost of the service will then be.)
