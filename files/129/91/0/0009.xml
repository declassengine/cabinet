DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)1.1 st January, 1952RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET union memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Cabinet have asked me to circulate a memorandum on themain issues which need to be considered in dealing with the soviet union in present circumstances.   This is a very large subject but Ihave set out in this paper some general thoughts.GSI TSRAli C QNSIDER AT IONS2.      I begin with a consideration of the objectives of British foreignpolicy.   They are, in my view -(a) the preservation of peace;  we desire this for materialas well as moral reasons;   global v/ar would destroyus;   a limited war would be expensive, would damage our trade and would involve the risk of drifting intoglobal war;(b) the maintenance of stability, both political and economic,throughout the world;  we live by our trade;(?)   the defence of free institutions and of human rights wherethey exist;   where they do not, the encouragement oftrends which will result in ordered progress towards them.3.      By what methods can we achieve those objectives?(a) The main threat to their achievement comes from Communistimperialism.   At present this is directed by the rulers of the soviet union but they are likely to be joined in the not too distant future by theleaders of Communist China.   We must therefore ourselves resist, andorganise others to resist, the threat from these quarters.   the strengthening of British power and influence is an important factor, butwe have to recognise that we are no longer capable of containing the communists on our own.(b) It follows that -(i)    we must work in the closest harmony with theUnited States;(ii)    we must uyake everything \s?e can of the intangibleCommonwealth association (which is or should befundamentally anti-Communist);.,1-COPY NO.CABINET
(iii)    we must continue our support of those organisationsformed to meet the threat, i. e0 the north Atlantic treaty organisation (N,A0T.Oo)0 the Bagdad Pact and theSouth East Asia Treaty Organisation (S0E^A0T,0,);(iv)   in our relations with our dependent peoples, we must continue to give the example of ordered progress which, whatever may b.e said^ in fact commands the respect of almost everyone.PUBLIC OPINION4j      The support of public opinion for Ker Majesty&apos;s Governments foreipolicy is essential.   The Soviet Government are playing a clever gamein appealing over the Heads of Governments to public opinion in theWestern countries and in the uncommitted countries.   In the past, Sovietmisdeeds in Czechoslovakia, in Korea and in Hungary, the unattractive-ness of the Soviet leaders (Stalin, Molotov, Vyshinsky), together withthe unpleasantness of many Western fellow-travellers, have enabled usto retain the fundamental support of the majority of the public for our attitude to the Soviet Union.   But the new Soviet methods have a greaterappeal and v/e must convince public opinion that we are not only pursuingthe objectives mentioned in paragraph 2 above but also that we arehandling our relations with the Soviet Union prudently, skilfully a^cl insuch a way as to lose no opportunity for a compromise or workingarrangement on any and every cause of friction.5a What do those generalities (imperfectly and elliptically expressed)mean in terms of current policy and action by Her Majesty&apos;s Government?Without attempting any order of priority, I consider that they requires-(a) The correct deployment of the resources available.(b) Proper public presentation of the contrast betweenRussian and Western attitudes.(c) Positive policies on -(i)   Disarmament(ii)   European security(iii)   The Middle East.(d) Definition of our attitude to the satellite countries.(e) Co-ordination of economic policy and effort includingmeasures against economic penetration by the Communiststates.(f) The greater flow of information and the development of personal contacts between us and the Soviet Union.(g) Expansion of trade with the Communist countries.
SECRET g g60 Each of the matters set out in paragraph 5 is important, but forbrevity I will deal only summarily with some of them.(ci)    he correct deployment of the resources availableV/e have still some way to go to convince our allies that thestruggle is global and therefore that our resources must be correctlydeployed globally.   I am told the reason why Mr. Adlai Stevenson refusedto join the American Delegation in Paris was because he felt that thelatter were concentrating too much upon military measures in Europe.The United States Secretary of State, Mr. Dulles, however on his return from Paris is reported to have said that he had found no interest amongthe European states about anything but military measures in Europe,,If Mr. Dulles said this, he completely misrepresented the British andthe European position.   I am going further into this report.However that may be, we must continue to press our own pointcf view.   We want a military doctrine to be produced for Europe whichwill preserve the deterrent and provide for adequate forces (a.) to preventactual incursions and (b) to ensure that if there is an attack the majorNoA.T.O. allies are involved.   I believe that forces of sufficient sise canbe provided without making it impossible for the N.A.T.O. countries to preserve their economic strength, and also impossible to have enoughavailable to tackle political and economic problems along the rest of theworld front.Further progress must await the proposed Ministerial N*A.TcO.meeting in March.(b) Public presentation of the contrast of Russian and WesternattitudesThe need for that is self-evident.   It is my hope that clearer ideas of how to achieve it will emerge from consideration of this paper.(c) (i)   DisarmamentOur basic position is that a fs^r-reaching disarmament agreement will never be attained until there has been a settlsment of most of thepolitical problems of the world and the removal of the causes of friction.On the other hand we think that a partial disarmament agreement would contribute to a lessening of tension and to the solution of these other difficulties.   V/e face the fact however that such a partial disarmamentagreement cannot go very far, failing the settlement of other problems.In conducting our discussions with the Soviet Union, we have to guard against two main dangers -(a) their attempt to nibble away at the nuclear deterrentwhilst leaving conventional forces untouched;(b) their attempt to interweave into the disarmament discussionssomething which will lead to the neutralisation of the wholeof Germany.
SECRETSIOur present position as put forward in the proposals of29th August safeguards us from both these dangers.These proposals can be summarised as follows -1.     Suspension of nuclear tests for two years.2,     New production of fissionable material not to beused for manufacturing nuciear weapons.3.     If 2. were achieved, then 1. could continue indefinitely.4.     Initial transfer of existing stocks of fissionable material to peaceful purposes.5.    Reduction from outset of programme, of conventionalarmaments and military man-power.6.    Ground and air inspection to safeguard against surpriseattack.7.     Undertaking to use nuclear weapons only in self-defence.8.    Use of outer space only for peaceful purposes.9.    Above agreements to be subject to existence of appropriatecontrol measures.That, I feel coupled with the challenge to set up working groups containedin the Prime Minister&apos;s last letter to Mr. Bulganin, is a perfectlydefensible position.   Nevertheless, we should consider whether there is any respect in which we can afford to give a little ground.I think there are two respects in which this might be possible.I feel myself that if the United States Government amends the atomic energy Act and agrees to give us almost in its entirety the know-howwhich we are seeking to acquire by our own testss then we might join the United States (if they were ready to do the same, which might or might not be the case) in some agreement with the Russians about tests.Secondly, I believe that we could go a considerable way in the event ofGerman reunification towards the de-nuciearisation of an area in the rniddlof Europe.   I do not think that this would have much military significancebut it might be a political sedative.   Dr. Adenauer has already said hewould accept the demilitarisation of the jxresent Eastern Zone of germany in the event of reunification.   I cannot see what harm there would be inadding a strip on either side of the Eastern Zone of say 100 miles oreven more which might be de-nuclearisedo   I do not believe that this idea would meet with much objection from the Germans.There is a third possibility, fraught with greater political danger.The Germans have hitherto appeared to be adamant on the point that theywill not have any thinning cut along the existing line on the ground thatthis would perpetuate the division of Germany.   This is a difficult position.   At the NoA.T,,O0 meetings, in private discussion with the
Chancellor, we put to him the advantages of having, e. g. a 100 milebelt free from Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (I0R.B.MC) but hewould have none of it.   He has since said that he could accept not havingthem in West Germany or in a part of it if the decision was reached on military rather than political grounds,   We may want to press him onthis point.   There may also be other forms of disengagement which would bring us advantages, e.g. limited force withdrawals from the presentline   We would have to try to convince the Germans that any scheme ofdisengagement which we favoured would improve rather than hinder theprospects of eventual reunification.(ii) European security the Minister of Defence and I will soon be in a position to circulate to our colleagues a report based on a study in which our officials are still engaged on the instructions of the Prime Minister aboutthe possibilities of &quot;disengagement&quot;.   I have referred to this topic tosome extent in the preceding sub-paragraph.   I do not wish to prejudge the findings of the report.   But the dangers of extensive disengagementare fairly obvious, i. e. making more likely the neutralisation of Germany,the withdrawal of American forces from Europe and the break-up ofN.A.T0O.   On the other hand, disengagement would contribute towards aslackening of tension and certain limited forms of it might have positivemilitary advantages.   I think it important for us to remember that muchas we wish a slackening of tension, a vigorous Germany with 75 millioninhabitants even if possessing only conventional armaments, would ifreunited outside the Western alliance, be a menace to peace and stability in Europe.   Those who most demand such a Germany would be least willingto take any stept- to keep it under control.   It is a paramount British interestto prevent such a Germany emerging.   It is equally a paramount british interests to keep United States forces in Europe and N.A.T.O. in effectiveexistence.(iii) Middle east the Suez operation imposed a temporary strain upon ourMuslim friends in the Middle East.   The Bagdad Pact helped to steadythe situation.   The Shah of Persia, President Iskander Mirza of pakistan and Mr. Menderes of Turkey helped very much to sustain Nuri Pashaand the friendly elements among the Arabs.   Since then, in spite of allthe efforts of our enemies to identify us with Israel, our reputation inArab eyes has been substantially restored.   My own view is that under-lying public Arab condemnation has been a certain respect for our decisionto use force.H.M. Ambassador in Amman in a recent despatch said that thecontest between East and West in the Middle East is like a game oftennis in which the only score is from a double fault.   The United Statesserved a double fault when Mr. Loy Henderson made his visit to Ankara,They served another double fault over the sensationalised arms delivery to Jordan.   The Russians served a double fault in their attempt to use the United Nations over the alleged Turkish threat to Syria.   The UnitedKingdom has lain pretty low through ail this and thereby we have gainedin influence, certainly in Jordan and probably in the other friendly Arabareas.   However this reticence to declare ourselves can be pushed too farand iu spite of the risk of our serving a double fault, we must have somepositive: views,   I think they should be along the following lines --5-SECRET
(1)        To support our friends.   We have done this by the contributions,financial and other/ise, we have made to the Bagdad Fact;  by military aid to Iraq and to the Lebanon;  by the development loan to Jordan;  by our support of the Ruler of Bahrain in his internal difficulties;  and our aid to the Sultan of Muscat,   We have helped the Government of theSudan directly and indirectly.(?.)       In the Arab-Israel struggle we are under constant pressure from our Arab friends, particularly Muri, to make some gesture helpful to them.   We are discussing this with the Americans, but on the face ofit, it is difficult to find anything that would help Nuri without going too far from the Israeli point of view.   This is an area so fraught with difficulty that I think it is appropriate to use the Secretary-General ofthe United Nations as the most likely means of coaxing both sides towards a settlement.   Kis efforts over the recent Mount Scopus and GovernmentRouse controversies in Jerusalem bear out this view.(3)        To support any reasonable initiative towards a development plan for the Middle East as an area.   Mr, Hammarskjold is considering a plan of this nature but he envisages the creation of an Arab ministerial council to control the allocation of priorities to regional development projects, and to organise the provision of funds from richer arab countries, the oil companies and elsewhere.   Kis plan bristles withpractical difficulties.   It could be extremely dangerous for us.   I have therefore laid it down that we should be careful not to indicate anydisapproval of his objectives;   it would be fatal if we were thought to beobstructing a development plan for the Middle East;   on the other hand we should bring out in full relief the practical difficulties of his presentideas in the hope that we may divert him into more realistic areas of thought,(d) Definiti on of our attitude to satellite countriesIf we appear to lose heart in our dealings with the Russiansor to lose interest in negotiating with them, the satellite populations maybegin to lose hope,   I do not subscribe to Mr. Kennan&apos;s belief that thesepopulations will accommodate themselves to the Soviet order in a relatively short space of time if they gain the impression that the Westhas stopped caring about them.   History shows that ideas of independencecontinue to survive in Eastern Europe generation after generation in themost discouraging conditions.   The rebellion of the Hungarians proved that their spirit had not been damaged by twelve years of Communistoccupation.   Nevertheless, there is a limit to what these peoples can beexpected to accomplish in the way of actual resistance if they are deprived of any gleam of hope that their condition may one day be changed.   Oneof the demands which the Prussians are now putting forward mostinsistently is that we should recognise the status quo .   We should neverdo this.(e) Co-ordination of economic policy and effort includingmeasures against economic penetration by CommuniststatesThis is a slow and laborious task.   We are attempting to studyit as ihe moment with the United States administration.   Progress isfrankly diappo intinga
We must remember that a serious economic recession in theFree World would nullify the best laid military and economic plans.(f) The greater flow of information and the development of personal contacts between us and the Soviet union and(g) More tradeI will not attempt to deal with these matters in this paper.NEGOTIATION WITH THE SOVIET UNION7.        We have publicly declared our willingness to negotiate with theRussians.   As I have said above, public confidence in our conduct offoreign policy will depend to a considerable extent upon whether or not we show ourselves sincere in that willingness.   I do not share Mr. Dullesview that the Russians will not keep any agreement made with them.   Ifit is about a specific subject and expressed in specific terms with theaction to be taken precisely prescribed, then the Russians are as likelyto keep such an agreement as anyone.   The kind of agreement they arenot capable of keeping is a vague engagement to approach a matter in acertain spirit, for example, a &quot;Gentlemen&apos;s Agreement&quot; that free anddemocratic institutions should be allowed to flourish in a certain area ofthe world.   It is contrary to their whole system of government and their nature to operate this kind of agreement.8.        One of the depressing features about the present situation isthat the Russians are showing no willingness to negotiate with us, as wewould understand the term, about anything.   There was a certainnegotiation about the Austrian Treaty; over cultural exchanges and to avery limited extent over trade, there was an indication in 1956 ofwillingness to negotiate:   during an earlier phase detailed problems inBerlin could be discussed.   But over the last year, there has been nonegotiation, with the sole exception that their agreement to an inspectionsystem to supervise suspension of tests could perhaps be regarded asan attempt to negotiate on that specific problem.9.         Therefore in considering the methods of opening new discussions with the Soviet I am not confident that they want to do anything more thancontinue the processes of discussion by public statement, in order to force the West into unilateral concessions.   Nevertheless, 1 think thereis a genuine Russian anxiety which will continue for some years aboutpossible United States military action and that might lead to realnegotiations on some point.   The Rapacki plan might be an example.   just as the Russian agreement to finalise the Austrian Treaty came out of the blue, so some similar decision might be made by them in future.10. Whatever channels may be used for discussion with the Russians,there are two general precepts which we must observe -(a)  We must keep in step with our allies and in particular withthe United States.   This observation is not so easy in practice as it maysoui^d.   Wf; often form an opinion which is different from that of theUnited stated.es Government as to wha.t points may be worth seriouslypursuing with the Russians and the method of doing so,-7-
(b)  The steps we take must be understood by our own publicopinion.11.      There are four different channels that can be used, the traditional diplomatic channel, the United Nations, Ministerialmeetings and Summit meetings.(a) Summit meetings represent the method v/hich is most favoured by the general public.   It is primarily for this reason thatBulganin has laid such emphasis on it in his last letter.   While the public will understand that an unprepared Summit meeting is not likely to achieve anything, they will not be likely to accept this as an excuse for postponing one indefinitely.   We must therefore reconcile ourselves tosuch a meeting.   And since this is so, we must avoid the impression thatwe have been dragged to such a meeting by Russian insistence.(b) In their latest Note theRussians have rejected our proposalfor a meeting of Foreign Ministers.   They probably have two motives forthis.   First, to accept our proposal would have interfered with the propaganda impact of their call for a Summit meeting.   Secondly, theymay be genuinely averse from negotiating with Mr. Dulles.(c) There is no demand at the moment by the Russians for negotiations in the United Nations, apart from the not very seriousproposals for a special Assembly or something similar on disarmament.We must remember that in certain circumstances the Security council might afford cover for private negotiations with the Russians, perhapsthrough the permanent representatives in New York.(d) There is no prima facie reason why we should not havediscussions with the Russians through ordinary diplomatic channels,e.g. through the Western Ambassadors in Moscow.   The advantage ofthis channel is that it is removed from   the limelight.   For the purposeof testing the Russians and clearing away the rubble in preparation for ministerial or Summit meetings, this method is probably the best.12.      In the light of these general considerations we have to decide what reply should be sent to Bulganin&apos;s latest letter suggesting a summit meeting at Geneva in two or three months1 time.   In the letter he suggestedcertain variants for participation at the Conference.   On this point I havehad certain communications from the Prime Minister during the last fewdays about which I will inform the Cabinet at the meeting on Wednesday.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.1.21st January, 1958
