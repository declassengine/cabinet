introduction-2.   [To be drafted].Balance of power. The purpose of Britain&apos;s defence effort is to help to preserve peace and stability in the world. Under conditions of modern war this task cannotany longer be thought of in terms of national defence. Present-day military preparations cannot be planned on a national basis, since no country is strong enough or large enough to stand alone. Nor can they properly be described as defence. For there remains no effective protection against all-out war,save the threat of devastating retaliation; and it is by this crude method thatthe peace of the world is now being &quot;maintained.4. Russia&apos;s successful launching of artificial satellites is evidence ofher remarkable progress in rocket development. But it should not be thoughtthat this has upset the balance of military power.5. In fact, the overall superiority of the West is likely to increase ratherthan diminish, as a consequence of the advent of medium-range ballisticrockets. These weapons, against which there is at present no answer, could,fiom sites in Europe and elsewhere, dominate practically every target ofimportance in the Soviet Union. The possession by Russia of rockets of equal range will not, for reasons of geography, afford her any correspondingstrategic advantage. It would be of no use to her to attack Western Europe,unless she could simultaneously knock out the vital strategic air bases in theUnited States. She could at present have no reasonable hope of achieving this with manned bombers and it will still take her several years to complete the development of an accurate inter-continental rocket and produce it insufficient numbers. By then, the United States, which has now also successfully launched an artificial satellite, will have inter-continental rocketsalso; and strategic rocket weapons of all ranges will, in due course, be maderelatively invulnerable by siting underground. Meanwhile, both sides are proceeding with the development of submarines, capable of firing nuclearmissiles from under water.6. There is thus no military reason why peace should not continue tobe maintained for another generation or more through the balancing fears of mutual annihilation. In fact, there is no reason why all this should not go on almost indefinitely. But that would indeed be a mournful prospect.To-day no country can hope to gain anything by war; and all would deriveincalculable benefit from the restoration of mutual confidence and real peace.7. There can, however, be no mutual confidence or real peace so longas the arms race continues with ever increasing momentum. Means mustbe found to halt and reverse this ruinous process.152892c* 2Britain&apos;s Contribution to Security
8. It is not necessary to stress the practical difficulties of reaching agreement on disarmament and of enforcing the agreement, once made.The issue is further complicated by the possibility that additional nuclea^jpowers may emerge in a few years&apos; time. Nor is the problem confined to reaching agreement between Russia and the West. In the next decade, thevast potential resources of China will have to be reckoned with as an increasingly important element in the balance of power.9. The ultimate aim must be complete disarmament by ail nations, coupled with complete inspection and control by a world authority with a world police force. Nothing less than this makes sense. That may seem a long way off.But it is just as well to recognise it and proclaim it as the final objective.10. It would, of course, be too much to hope that complete disarmamentcould be brought about all at one stroke. The objective will have to be pursued by stages. If the safety of humanity is not to be imperilled, great care must be taken to maintain, at each successive stage, the balance ofmilitary power and deterrents, which, for the present, constitute almost the sole safeguard of peace.11. In seeking a basis for agreement, account must be taken of theentirely different military positions of the two sides.12. Russia has been making great strides in the field of nuclear weapons and rockets. But her real strength lies in her overwhelming superiority inconventional armaments and military manpower. The Soviet Union and hersatelliles have over 200 active divisions, some 20,000 aircraft, and a fleetwhich includes some 500 submarines.13. The West, on the other hand, relies for its defence primarily uponthe deterrent effect of its vast stockpile of nuclear weapons and its capacity to deliver them. These constitute the only real protection which the free world possesses. The democratic Western nations will never start a war against Russia. But it must be well understood that, if Russia were to launch a major attack on them, even with conventional forces only, they would haveto hit back with strategic nuclear weapons. In fact, the strategy of N.A.T.O. isbased on the frank recognition that a full-scale Soviet attack could not berepelled without resort to a massive nuclear bombardment of the sources of power in Russia. In that event, the role of the allied defence forces in europe would be to hold the front for the time needed to allow the effects of the nuclear counter-offensive to make themselves felt.14. It is best that these facts should be stated plainly ; since the one thingwhich might conceivably tempt the Soviet Union into military adventurewould be the erroneous belief that the West, if attacked, would flinch from using its nuclear power.Disarmament15. Against this background, it is easy to understand why the SovietGovernment constantly demands a total and immediate ban on nuclear weapons, without offering any equally far-reaching or rapid disarmament :6hthe conventional side. In taking this line Russia also derives an immensepropaganda advantage, since she is ab&apos;e to exploit the natural revulsion withwhich normal people everywhere regard weapons of mass destruction: V2
- 16. The Western nations, although they know that their entire safetyrests upon the possession of nuclear power, have never resisted the ideahat nuclear weapons should be progressively reduced. But they obviouslycannot agree to this without fully compensating reductions in conventional forces.  Otherwise Russia would be left in a position to dominate the world.17. On the other hand, it must be recognized tha\ however carefully thebalance of armaments is held, there always remains, a possibility that someunforeseen circumstance or miscalculation might spark off a world-wideexplosion. Therefore, since there are risks in leaving things as they are,it was felt justifiable, within reasonable limits, to accept risks in trying to bringabout a settlement. It was in this spirit and with these considerations in mind that Britain, Canada, France and the United States put forward, through theUnited Nations, a balanced and controllable plan for disarmament by stageswhich could begin to take effect even in the absence of progress in thesolution of major political problems. Their main proposals can besummarized as follows:-(a) nuclear tests to be immediately suspended;(Jb) production of fissile material for weapon purposes to be stopped:(c) existing military stocks of fissile material (including material already incompleted weapons) to be progressively transferred to civil purposes:((/) conventional armaments and military manpower to be progressively reduced;(e) an effective system of inspection to be instituted, to ensure that the-agreements are observed by both sides and to reduce the danger of surprise attack.18. This plan was endorsed by the United Nations by the overwhelming majority of 56 to 9. The only opposition came from the countries of theSoviet bloc, who not only voted against it, but subsequently declared their intention to boycott all further proceedings of the United NationsDisarmament Commission.19. More recently, the Governments of N.A.T.O. jointly declared inParis that they are ready to discuss with the Soviet Government its proposals,together with the Western proposals and any other proposals from any orherquarter. These discussions need not. of course, be confined to the subjectof disarmament. The first step towards disarmament is not necessarily adisarmament agreement. If some progress could be made towards thesettlement of one or more of the outstanding political problems, big or small, this would help to create a more favourable atmosphere in whichfhe question of disarmament could be pursued with a better prospect ofsuccess.20. If agreement could be reached the prize for humanity would betremendous. Therefore, despite the frustrating experience of previous negotiations, which have been used as a sounding board for communist propaganda, it would be unthinkable to give up trying, until every conceivablepossibility has.been exhausted.3
21. Though optimism must be tempered by past disappointment. her majesty&apos;s Government will approach any further discussions withoutprejudice and with resolute determination to make them succeed, it wouldjjbe unrealistic not to recognise the difficulties. But, provided both sides havela genuine will to reach agreement, it should not be impossible to find somefair and workable method of composing the differences which at presentdivide, impoverish and endanger the world.22. Hope lies in the fact that disarmament is obviously just as muchin the true interests of Russia as of every other country.23. But. even with the best intentions, these negotiations are bound tobe extremely complicated and consequenUy protracted; and when agreement has been reached, its full implementation will inevitably take a number ofyears.24. Meanwhile, the free world cannot afford to lower its guard. Untildisarmament is actually achieved, the utmost vigilance and preparednessmust be maintained. There can be no letting up in anticipation of aninternational agreement which, however much the West desires it, may notnecessarily materialise.Collective Defence25. The. protection of the free world against the Communist threat mustincreasingly be treated as a single problem, and must be undertaken bythe collective effort of all the countries concerned. This idea of collective defence inspired the creation of N.A.T.O., the Baghdad Pact and S.E.A.T.O.Through these three regional systems, which include other members of theCommonwealth, Britain will continue to make her main contribution to thejoint task of preserving peace.26. If the full benefits of collective defence are to be obtained, themembers of the alliance must be prepared to accept that they will inevitablybecome more and more inextricably dependent on one another. The concept of interdependence in defence planning of all kinds was formally enunciatedby President Eisenhower and the Prime Minister in Washington last october and was subsequently endorsed by the fifteen Governments of N.A.T.O. inParis. The practical application of this principle will unavoidably raise, ineach of the countries concerned, military, economic and political problems of varying kinds; but in view of the unquestionable benefits to the common cause, ways must be found of overcoming them.27. The policy of interdependence is particularly applicable to theNorth Atlantic Alliance, which has an international command with a joint planning organisation. Within this integrated structure, it should be possiblegradually to get away from the idea that each member nation must continueto maintain self-contained national forces, which by themselves are fullybalanced. Instead, each should seek to make the most useful contributionit can to the combined forces of the alliance as a whole.28. Even greater advantages are obtainable from collective action inthe technical and industrial fields. The members of N.A.T.O. possessbetween them the world&apos;s greatest manufacturing and scientific capacity.If research and production could be jointly planned, considerable economies4
in time and resources could undoubtedly be secured, particularly in regardto weapon development. [Insert passage about co-operation with U.S.A.,^europe and Commonwealth.&apos;]29. Within the Baghdad Pact and S.E.A.T.O. defence systems, it isequally desirable to secure effective integration of the efforts of the countries concerned, though circumstances make it impracticable to carry this process to the same lengths as in N.A.T.O. Central planning organisations with jointstaffs have, however, been set up; and it will be the aim to develop progres-sively closer co-ordination of the available forces of the member States.Nuclear Deterrent30. These three regional defence organisations together provide a vitally important defensive shield along the frontiers of the free world. But by themselves they would be ineffective, were it not for the fact that behind them stands the immense nuclear power of the West. This continues to restprimarily upon the strength and constant readiness of the American StrategicAir Command, with its bases all round the world and its vast supply ofmegaton bombs.31. Britain is now making an increasingly significant contribution tothe nuclear deterrent. She has a substantial and growing stockpile ofkiloton weapons, the design of which is being steadily improved as a resultof the experience gained from the trials at the Maralinga proving ground inAustralia. Following upon the successful thermo-nuclear tests at christmas island, British megaton bombs are now in production and deliveries to theRoyal Air Force are beginning.32. The British strategic bomber force, which is equipped to carry thesebombs, provides a mobile and flexible form of military power. While based in Britain, its aircraft can be transferred within a few hours to stationsoverseas. The majority of the squadrons are equipped with Valiants; butthe proportion of Vuleans and Victors, with their greater performance, is steadily increasing. These can fly as high and as fast as any bombers in service in any other country; and the accuracy of their navigational andbomb-aiming equipment is unsurpassed. In addition, good progress is beingmade with the development of propelled bombs, which can be released froma considerable distance, thereby making it unnecessary for the aircraft to fly into the more heavily defended target area.33. Britain&apos;s nuclear power cannot, of course, be compared with thatof the United States. Nevertheless, when equipped with megaton weapons,the British bomber force will in itself constitute a formidable deterrent.34. If the deterrent influence of the bomber force is to be fully effectiveit must not be thought capable of being knocked out on. the ground by a surprise attack. Measures are accordingly being taken to raise its state of readiness, so as to reduce to the minimum the time needed for take-off. Otheiaction is also being taken to increase the security of the bomber force. Inorder to obtain the earliest possible warning of the approach of hostileaircraft, the organisation of the radar watch is being improved and is being more fully linked with the system on the Continent.5
. 35. Now that Britain has a substantial strategic bomber force and ugrowing stockpile of nuclear weapons of her own, it has become necessary kco-ordinate operational plans with the United States Air Force.36. Following upon the decision, announced a year ago. that it was not practicable to attempt to defend the country as a whole against nuclear attack.Fighter Command now has the more limited task of protecting the bomberbases; and its strength is being correspondingly reduced. When the Russians,in addition to their manned bomber force, have ballistic rockets in sufficient numbers capable of knocking out airfields in Britain, the value of a fighterdefence system will obviously decrease; and the same will apply to a missiledefence system, effective only against aircraft. But that stage has not yet beenreached. Meanwhile, the squadrons of Fighter Command will continue to play their part in defending the deterrent. British short-range ground-to-airmissiles will begin to be deployed during the coming year, and a longer rangetype is in course of development. In the development of these weapons theWoomera rocket range in Australia is playing an invaluable part.37. Britain&apos;s contribution to the strategic deterrent will representless than one-fifth of the total Defence Estimates for 1958-59. this figure includes the cost of the strategic bomber force and its nuclear bombs and of the fighter force and radar system in Britain. It also covers the costof research and development related to the deterrent and its defence, includingguided missiles and ballistic rockets. About half the expenditure on the deterrent is at present going into forces and equipment for its defence. Onthe basis of present plans and estimates, it does not seem likely that the costof the deterrent will increase significantly over the next few years.Ballistic Rockets38. The Western nuclear deterrent will shortly be supplemented byballistic rockets. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have accepted the offer of theUnited States Government to supply Britain with American intermediate-range ballistic missiles. In order to comply with United States law, the nuclearwarheads will remain under American control.39. These weapons will be operated by personnel of the R.A.F. who will receive training in America. Should the first weapons be ready for deploymentbefore this training is completed. United States personnel will man the sitestemporarily until the R.A.F. are ready to take over. In either case the operational use of the missiles will be subject to joint decision by the twoGovernments. The deployment of the missiles will be governed by technical and military considerations and they will be dispersed over an appreciablenumber of sites. It is planned to locate them on property already owned bythe Government.40. The financial arrangement is broadly that the United States will pay for the missiles themselves and for the special equipment connected withthem; while Britain will meet the cost of constructing the sites and other necessary capital expenditure in this country. The British share is estimated to be about  10 millions. This will be financed out of sterling counterpartfunds of United States defence aid.41. These American rockets cannot, of course, be regarded as an element of independent British nuclear power, but they represent a valuable addition6
Conventional Forces42. The strategic nuclear deterrent is the decisive factoirin the preventionof major war; but it does not obviate the need for maintaining an adequateshield of land forces, with air and naval support, tb defend the frontiers ofthe free world. Nor could it, of course,&apos;be used in localised emergencies,still less for preserving order and stability, all of which tasks represent alarge part of the present responsibilities of the British armed forces.43. For these roles the primary need is for mobile, well-equipped,conventional forces. Apart from tactical nuclear aircraft bombs and artilleryweapons for use in appropriate circumstances, the three Services will continueto be equipped with non-nuclear weapons, and a substantial part of the research and development effort for them is being devoted to projects of thiskind. .....44. The greater part of Britain&apos;s military effort will continue to go intoconventional forces. After allowing for the withdrawal of British troops fromKorea and Jordan and for the reductions in Germany. Libya. Malaya.Hong Kong and elsewhere, Britain is still maintaining forces of the three services of over 200,000 men in support of her alliances and overseas commitments in the Far East, the Middle East. Europe and the Atlantic.These substantial forces represent a very considerable contribution by theBritish nation to the preservation of stability and peace throughout the world.45. The widely dispersed nature of Britain&apos;s military responsibilitiesmakes it essential for the Army to maintain a strong Central Reserve sup-ported by an adequate fleet of aircraft to carry reinforcements rapidly to anypart of the world. A proportion of this reserve will be kept at a high state of readiness, so that it can be moved at very short notice. In order to facilitateair transport, heavy equipment, vehicles and other supplies will be storedat focal points, such as Singapore. - ... -46. At present R.A.F. Transport Command is equipped with Hastingsand Comet aircraft for long-distance lifts and with Bevefleys for transportationwithin the theatre of operations. These will-be supplemented..by&apos;Brifahhias,of which twenty have been.ordered, This will greatly expand the Commandslong-range troop-carrying capacity. ........; 47. Close co-operation continues to be maintained between the armed forces of the United Kingdom and those of other members of the Comriion-wealth. Australia and New Zealand are sharing with Britain the task of helping Malaya in her resistance to Communist terrorism. The RoyalRhodesian Air Force is playing its part in Middle East defence, and a squadron operates from Aden. Discussions - have recently been held withthe Union of South Africa about the defence of the African continent. TheRoyal Navy periodically carries out joint exercises with - the naval forcesof all other Commonwealth countries.       -  ; 1%to the combined strength of the Anglo-American nuclear deterrent. Meanwhile,a British ballistic rocket of more advanced design is being developed in close-&apos;^co-operation with the United States on the highest priority. This will carry a megaton warhead, and is being designed for launching from underground.
Command Structure in Middle East49.   A number of important changes have been made in the commandstructure in the Middle East.50. The Governors of Kenya. Tanganyika and Uganda have resumedcontrol of their local forces whose role in future will be internal security andlocal defence. At the request of the Governors the General OfficerCommanding and the majority of officers continue to be provided from theBritish Army. Any British troops of the Central Reserve who are stationed in Kenya will not form part of the local garrison and their use will be controlled from London.51. As regards the remainder of the Middle East Command, conditionsin that area make it no longer practicable to control from a singleheadquarters in Cyprus the British forces in the East Mediterranean as wellas those in the Arabian Peninsula. It has. therefore, been decided to create an independent integrated Command, with headquarters at Aden. This will come into operation on April 1st next, and will be responsible for the british forces of all three Services in the Arabian Peninsula, together with the naval units allotted to the Persian Gulf.52. The creation of this new Command will involve only a slight increase in the staff of the existing headquarters at Aden. On the other hand,the separation of the forces in the Arabian Peninsula from the Middle east command will enable appreciable reductions to be made in the headquartersorganisation in Cyprus.Sea Power53. During the past year, the Government have reviewed the role,composition and disposition of the Royal Navy. British naval forces mustbe fitted to perform three main tasks:  In peacetime, to help carry out BritaitVs responsibilities in colonies andprotected territories, to defend British shipping and generally to contributeby their presence to the maintenance of peace and stability ;848. By the end of March, the strength of the British Army of the Rhinewill be about 64,000. This represents a reduction cf 13,000 during the last twelve months. The Council of the Western European Union has agreed .that the British troops in Germany should be further reduced to a total of55,000. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have stipulated that this is dependentupon satisfactory arrangements being made to meet local costs incurred inforeign currency. In this connection, the Government have, in accordancewith the revised Brussels Treaty, asked the North Atlantic Council to considerthe financial problem involved in maintaining their forces in Germany. Theindependent experts appointed by N.A.T.O. to examine the position, confirm that, the Deutschmark element in this expenditure, estimated at  47 millionsnext year, would represent a heavy additional burden on Britain&apos;s balanceof payments. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have accordingly made it clearthat, in the event of adequate financial assistance not being forthcoming, theywill reluctantly have to reconsider the size of the British land and air forcesthey can afford to retain on the Continent.
10 secret A V0in limited war, to protect sea communications, to escort troops and supplies to the theatre of operations and give them support in action ;in global war, to make an effective contribution to the combined naval forces of the Western Alliance.54. East of Suez it is proposed to maintain a balanced, all-purposefleet of appreciable strength. This is necessary to enable Britain to dischargeher obligations to S.E.A.T.O. and the Baghdad Pact alliances, and to fulfilher independent military commitments in that area.55. This Eastern Fleet will be based on Singapore. It will be composedof one aircraft carrier (with a balanced complement of strike, fighter and anti-submarine aircraft), one cruiser, and a number of destroyers, frigates and smaller vessels. It will also include a converted carrier equipped to accommodate a Marine Commando force and capable of carrying helicoptersfor either the troop-carrying or anti-submarine role. These ships will operatesingly or in groups, coming together at intervals for training.56. In the Atlantic and Mediterranean the Royal Navy and maritimeaircraft of the R.A.F. will continue to play their part in N.A.T.O.; though,as was explained a year ago, this will be on a somewhat reduced scale. Since,apart from certain colonial responsibilities, the Royal Navy would, in war,operate together with other allied navies, the aim should be to make the most effective contribution to the combined forces of the Alliance, and notnecessarily to provide a fully balanced ali-purpose British fleet.57. Russia*s formidable submarine force constitutes a threat which hasto be reckoned with, not only in global war in the Atlantic, but in situationsshort of global war anywhere in the world. This threat is of special concern to an island people, dependent upon sea communications for their food supplies and commercial life. For this reason the Government consider itdesirable to concentrate the efforts of the Royal Navy to an increasing extent on the anti-submarine role. To fulfil this task, the naval forces in the atlantic and Mediterranean will include two carriers (which, while containing somefighter and strike elements, will be equipped predominantly with anti-submarine aircraft and helicopters), two cruisers and a number of destroyers,frigates and submarines.58. In addition to the main operational fleets, a small number of frigateswill, at all times, be stationed in the Persian Gulf to discharge Britishresponsibilities in that area. Some light craft will be employed at HongKong for local defence, together with a frigate patrol to protect british shipping along the China Coast. A few frigates or destroyers will also bekept on the West Indies and on the South Atlantic Stations.59. The plans for the Reserve Fleet are being reviewed and brought into line with the above policy. In so doing, it is proposed to follow the principlethat the Reserve Fleet should comprise only sufficient ships to keep the ActiveFleet up to strength, allowing for accidents and long refits.60. A number of important projects are in hand to ensure that the royal navy will in the years ahead continue to keep abreast of the times. A newcomprehensive radar and aircraft control system for carriers, more advancedthan any other in service elsewhere, has been introduced.   A low-level tactical9
bomber is being developed for the Royal Navy, and its adoption by the RoyalAir Force :s being cons:dcrcd. The prototype will fly later this year. Thedevelopment of a British nuclear submarine is proceeding, and in this muchvaluable information and assistance is being received from the United States.Naval Dockyards61. The naval construction and modernisation programmes are beingaligned with this policy : and dockyard and base facilities are being curtailedto correspond with the planned reductions in the size of the Navy.62. The Naval base at Trincqmalee was handed over to the ceylon government last October: and the British naval establishments in Ceylon wilibe progressively withdrawn over the next four years. As already announced,the dockyard at Hong Kong will be closed by the end of 1959. thereafter the fleet East of Suez will be based on Singapore, and its maintenance and repairs will be mainly concentrated in the dockyard there.63. In the Mediterranean, the facilities in Gibraltar will continue tobe required. At Malta, the level of naval activity is likely to decline andcertain British firms are examining the feasibility of taking over the dockyardfor commercial use. In the light of the outcome of this examination, thefuture of the dockyard will be decided after consultation with the maltese government.64. At home, it is planned to close the naval dockyards at Portland andat Sheerness. The closures will be spread over a substantial period ; this will assist those who become redundant in finding other employment. It isexpected that the closure of the dockyard at Portland will be completed by april, 1959, and that at Sheerness a year later. Work will be concentratedat the Royal Naval Dockyards at Portsmouth, Devonport, Chatham andRosyth.Civil Defence65. Civil Defence will continue to form an integral part of the defenceplan. The framework of the local civil defence services and of the regional organisation is being maintained. Further provision is being made for training schools and training equipment; and additional orders are being placed forinstruments to measure radio-activity. It remains the Governments policy to encourage the recruitment and training of the Industrial Civil DefenceService, which contributes some 200.000 volunteers towards the total of well over half a million men and women now enrolled in civil defence.Improvements continue to be made in the warning and monitoring system and in defence communications.Contraction of Forces66. In accordance with the policy approved by Parliament, the processof reducing the size of the Forces is continuing. At the end of the year 1957-58.the three Services will have a combined strength of 606,000 (Navy 99,000,Army 325,000, R.A.F. 182,000).* This represents an overall reduction of83,000 during the current year.* Unless otherwise stated, manpower figures in paragraphs to relate to UnitedKingdom-based, adult, rmle personnel of all ranks, and do not include boys, women,Gurkas, Colonial troops or locally enlisted personnel.10
Regular Recruitment70. As announced a year ago in Command Paper 124, the Governmentare planning to bring National Service to an end by December 1962 and to rely thereafter on small all-regular forces of a combined strength of about375,000. By that date Britain&apos;s military commitments may quite possibly have increased or decreased; but nothing has so far happened to lead theGovernment to revise this figure or to alter its views about the prospects of recruiting the regulars needed.71. The Services have been given authority to recruit up to the followingceilings: Navy 88,000; Army 165,000; R.A.F. 135,000. The fact that these three ceiling figures for recruiting together total 388,000 does not mean thatit is intended to increase the planned strength of the combined forces beyondthe figure of 375,000 mentioned above. But the Government have felt it right for the present to maintain some flexibility.72. The Royal Navy obtains all its regulars on initial engagements of nine or twelve years. During 1957 it recruited 2,800 ratings and 4,300boys and apprentices. Of these 800 entered the Royal Marines. There isa need for some increase for recruits in certain branches, and also for theMarines who have a higher proportion of national servicemen to be replaced.If there were no change in the current trend of recruiting, the manpower,strength of the Royal Navy would be about 84,000 by the end of 1962.73. In regard to the Army, the picture cannot be presented so simply,since the whole pattern of recruitment has been radically altered by thedecision to end, with few exceptions, the three-year engagement and to1167. An undertaking was given that those whose careers were prematurelyterminated through the contraction of the Forces would be given faircompensation and would be helped in every way possible to find suitable employment in civilian life. Last July a scheme for compensation was published in Command Paper 231. The Royal Navy have completed the selection of those to be retired. Over 90 per cent, of the officers concerned,and 100 per cen&apos;. of the ratings, are voluntary applicants. The Army andthe Royal Air Force, where the problem is larger, are not so far advanced:but it is already clear that it will likewise be possible to deal with a high proportion of the redundancies in both Services on a voluntary basis.68. To help ex-Regulars to find suitable employment the Ministry ofLabour and National Service, the Services and the appropriate voluntaryassociations have been linked closely together in a Regular Forces ResettlementService. A Resettlement Advisory Board, under the Chairmanship ofSir Frederic Hooper, has been established and a number of ResettlementCommittees have been set up to cover the different parts of the country.69. The reduction in the size of the Army necessitates the disbandrnentor amalgamation of a number of units. Last July, plans were announced for reducing the &quot; teeth arm &quot; units by 51. (The Royal Armoured Corps is to bereduced by 8 regiments ; the Royal Artillery by 21 regiments ; the royal engineers by 5 regiments ; and the Infantry by 17 battalions.) By the end ofMarch 1958, 8 of these reductions will have been made. A further 22 will becarried out during 1958-59. Corresponding reductions will be made in thesupporting and administrative units.
Pay and Allowances79. Meanwhile, the Government have felt it right to introduce, withoutfurther delay, certain increases in the rates of pay and allowances for regularsof all ranks.   These will come into force early in April.12substitute for it an initial engagement of not less than six years. However,it is encouraging to observe that, in the first three months since the new scheme came fully into effect (November, December and January) long-termengagements have risen to . as compared with 685 in the correspondingperiod a year ago.74. Any forecasts based upon statistics over so short a period must betreated with great caution. Nevertheless, certain points are worth noting.As was expected, recruitment of men for the &quot; teeth arm &quot; units presents lessdifficulty than for most other corps. Without any improvement in the presentrecruiting trend, the infantry, which is the basic arm, would by the end of1962 be almost up to its planned strength.75. As was foreshadowed in the Defence Statement a year ago, the recruitment of men for the Army&apos;s technical, professional and administrative units raises special problems, about which it is not possible to generalise.The Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers do not appear likely tohave much difficulty in securing the numbers they need except in certain trades.On the other hand, the present recruitment rates for most of the other administrative corps are well below requirements.76. During 1957, the R.A.F. recruited about 5,600 airmen on long-serviceengagements, some 3,400 boys and apprentices and about 8,500 on short-service engagements. Recruiting both of men on 9-year engagementsand of apprentices and boys showed a satisfactory increase over the previous year. As was expected, the announcement of the plan to end NationalService led to a decline in recruiting on the shorter engagements. The present rate of recruiting of pilots is almost sufficient, but that of certain otheraircrew categories will need to be increased. If there were no change incurrent recruiting rates, the regular strength of the R.A.F. would expand toabout 120.000 by the end of 1962.77. It is most desirable to increase considerably the strength of theWomen&apos;s Services, which will have an increasingly important part to play inthe new all-regular forces. There is a wide range of duties open to them athome and abroad. It is hoped that the improvements in pay, allowances andother conditions will encourage more women to enter the W.R.N.S., W.R.A.C.and W.R.A.F.78. The willingness of men and women to serve in the armed forces is determined by a wide variety of factors, psychological as well as material. Inview of the importance of obtaining ihe regular recruits needed to enablenational service to be ended, the Government thought it desirable to initiatea fresh and comprehensive study of this question. They accordingly set up,last November, an independent committee, under the chairmanship ofSir James Grigg, to examine the problem in all its aspects and to make recommendations. It is hoped that the committee will present their reportby the end of the summer or early autumn.
80. All regular other ranks will receive an increase in weekly pay of14s.. 17s. 6d., or 21s., depending on their length of engagement. In addition,the special low rate for recruits is to be abolished. In future they will receive the same rate as the &quot; one-star private &quot; or his equivalent. Thiswill mean that a recruit enlisting on a six-year engagement will be paid24s. 6d. a week more than at present.81. Junior officers will receive proportionately larger increases than thosein the higher ranks. For example, the pay of a Second Lieutenant will beraised by  73 a year, and that of a Lieutenant-Colonel by  110.82. There will be a special increase in the pay of the Women&apos;s Services,over and above the general increase. The woman recruit will receive 21s. aweek more than at present.83. The rents of Service quarters are at present abnormally low. Oneicsult of this is that married officers and men for whom quarters are notavailable are liable to suffer serious financial disadvantage. To remedy this,it has been decided to increase the rate of marriage allowance, while atthe same time raising the rents of official quarters and to pay to other ranksthe &quot; out-of-quaners &quot; allowance of 3s. a day now payable to officers. these three measures, taken together, will leave those occupying Service quarters inbroadly the same financial position as they are now and will greatly improve the position of those not in quarters.84. Steps have recently been taken to remove various grievances andanomalies connected with allowances. For example, the scheme, under which men serving in certain oversea stations, who are separated from their families,aie granted a period of home leave, has been extended to Aden, thePersian Gulf and Habbaniya. The regulations governing the issue ofdisturbance allowance have been relaxed, so that this allowance will nownormally be payable for every move made for Service reasons, instead of onlyonce in each normal tour of duty. The unpopular system, whereby rationswere provided from Service sources for families in Germany, will shortly be changed. Certain restrictions on the use of leave travel warrants by service personnel stationed in Britain have been removed. Certain increases arebeing made in the education allowances payable to all ranks.85. The increases in pay and allowances, and other improvementsreferred to above, will cost about  33 millions in the year 1958-59, of which 23 millions is in respect of pay.Accommodation86. In addition, plans are going ahead for the improvement of accom-modation of all kinds for the armed forces at home and abroad.87. One of the attractions of Service life is the chance it offers to seethe world. The Government intend, as far as practicable, to remedy existingdeficiencies in barracks, married quarters and other accommodation overseas.As evidence of this policy, plans have recently been approved for theconstruction of additional new accommodation for units in Kenya, Aden,Malaya and Hong Kong.13
88. For the United Kingdom a comprehensive programme is being prepared for the replacement or modernisation of out-of-date barracks, messesand hospitals and the construction of considerably more married quarters atMa cost of about  90 millions over the next five years. The reorganisation ofsfithe forces during the past year unavoidably delayed decisions on the building programme, which will have the effecl of restricting the amount of construc-tion in the coming year. However, a number of important projects will be commended during the year. These include improvements in navalaccommodation both afloat and ashore and new barracks at a number ofR.A.F. stations. Important works already started for the Army at Colchester,Tidworth, Bovinglon, Windsor and Bicester will be pressed forward, and newbarrack and housing schemes will be put in hand during 1958, including those at Woolwich. Arborfield. Aldershot and Bordon.89. It is proposed to accelerate the provision of canteens and clubs, sportsgrounds, swimming baths and other recreational facilities. Particular attention will be paid to the needs of those serving overseas and at isolated stations athome. Work on these projects, estimated to cost  1 million, will be carriedout during the coming year.Reserve Forces90. The Royal Naval Reserve and the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserveare being amalgamated in order to make the best use of training and other facilities. Its members will be given more specialised training so that, ifmobilised, they will be ready for immediate active service. This single unifiedreserve will be known as the &quot; Royal Naval Reserve.&quot;91. The Territorial Army has been making good progress in recruitingvolunteers, and the annual camps have now been restricted to the volunteerelement. During the year, the number of volunteer other rank entrants direct from civil life increased from about 7.000 to about 14,000. The total numberof volunteers in the Territorial Army is now over 70,000 all ranks.92. The Royal Air Force needs reserves to bring operational units andthe Control and Reporting System up to war establishment, and to reinforceoverseas stations. Because of the short warning period likely in the event of attack, the reserves allocated to units in this country are being posted in peacetime to Reserve Flights attached to their operational stations. In theevent of war, an important role in the Control and Reporting System hasbeen allotted to the Royal Auxiliary Air Force.Economies in Administration93. The new Defence Administration Committee, composed of thePermanent Secretaries of the Ministry of Defence and the Service Departments,together with the Principal Personnel Officers and Principal administrative officers of the three Services, is beginning to produce results.94. Particular attention is being paid to the possibilities of entrustingone of the Services with responsibility for performing administrativefunctions on behalf of all three.   For example, steps are being taken14
progressively to reduce waste of effort due to the transport and handling of rations by each Service separately.  Small but useful savings have also been^fenade in other fields, as for instance over the movement of freight.   The^^possibility of pooling certain types of Service stores is being studied.95. Hospital facilities are being replanned in accordance with a singleco-ordinated scheme for all three Services. This will&apos; enable old anduneconomical hospitals to be eliminated.96. The Government have decided where practicable and economic tobring to an end the present system, under which each Service provides andmaintains separate overseas trunk wireless networks with its own transmittingand receiving stations. The possibility of transferring these functions to civilian agencies is being examined.97. The Defence Administration Committee have already sentinvestigation teams to study organisational problems in Malta and Aden, anda similar visit to Singapore is being arranged.Expenditure98. For the year 1957-58, the Defence Estimates, before the deduction of expected receipts from Germany and the United States, amounted to 1,483 millions, and, after their deduction, to  1,420 millions. The admiralty and Ministry of Supply will require supplementary estimates amounting to 43 millions.99. The Defence Estimates for 1958-59 amount to  1,465 millions before taking into account the payments in respect of the local costs of British Forcesin Germany. As in previous years, these costs, estimated at  47 millions,have been included as appropriations in aid. The estimates to be presented to Parliament will thus amount to  1,418 millions.100. Thus the Defence Estimates for 1958-59 are  2 millions less thanin 1957-58 or  45 millions less than the original and supplementary estimatescombined. Within these reduced estimates it has been found possible to absorb increased costs in civilian wages and prices amounting to about 50 millions, increases in Service pay and allowances costing  33 millions,compensation to officers and men prematurely retired totalling  21 millions,and a reduction of  16 millions in respect of payments from Germany andthe United States. It will therefore be seen that the new estimates implyreductions in the defence programme of the order of  120 millions.15
