secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. February 1958C. (58) 43 Copy No.17th February, 1958CABINETCYPRUSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe following is an account of the position reached in my talks with the Turkishand Greek Governments during the past fortnight. The starting point for thesetalks was the draft statement on policy circulated to the Cabinet by the colonial secretary with C. (58) 4.Discussions with the Turkish Government2. My discussions with the Turkish Ministers were held on 25th and26th January before the meetings of the Baghdad Pact. They were continued asfar as possible in the intervals between those meetings and ended with a finalconversation on 31st January. The Governor of Cyprus joined me in Ankara andwas present at two of my meetings with the Turkish Foreign Minister.The Turkish Position3. The Turks had previously seen the draft statement and indeed hadcommented on it before I arrived in Ankara. They maintained that their first choicehad always been that we should stay on in the island. Now, however, a new situation had arisen. The Turkish minority in Cyprus could no longer submit tobe governed by the Greek majority even under British rule and Turkey must havea physical state in the island in order to meet her security and strategic requirements.Accordingly, they urged that any interim constitutional developments should be onfederal lines, and that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should agree to proceed to the partition of the island as soon as possible. They asked that the assurance containedin the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statement of .19th December, 1956, with regard to the eventual option of partition should be incorporated in a treaty which would be binding on any future Government in this country. Finally, they pressed for theearly convening of a conference for the purpose of considering the strategic requirements of the United Kingdom and her allies. They hoped that if Greecerefused to attend such a conference Her Majesty&apos;s Government would neverthelesshold discussions with the Turkish Government alone and then make arrangementsfor establishing a Turkish base in Cyprus forthwith. They said more than once that they would not in the least mind a Greek base if the Turks had one. TheTurkish Ministers showed no particular interest in the proposals for terminating theemergency and for the return of Archbishop Makarios. They asked, however, thatthe Archbishop should not be named in the statement to be made by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment.Reply to the Turkish Case4. I told the Turkish Ministers that in the particular circumstances of Cypruswhere the two communities were inextricably mixed it would be inappropriate to speak of federal institutions. Our purpose, however, was to develop institutionswhich had the support of both communities. I indicated that it might be possibleto extend the arrangements whereby certain aspects of public affairs affecting the53028b
two communities might be dealt with separately and suggested a form of words which would make it clear that such was our intention. I emphasised the difficultiesof partition and pointed out that Her Majesty&apos;s Government regarded partition asthe last resort. I made it clear, however, that we stood by the statement ofDecember 1956. I undertook to include in the draft statement a passage to theeffect that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would issue invitations as soon as possible toa conference at which the security and strategic requirements of the UnitedKingdom and her allies would be discussed, and I assured the Turkish ministers that at that conference Her Majesty&apos;s Government would have a positive proposalto put forward regarding means to safeguard Turkish security and strategic interests..I gave no specific commitment, however, as to when and in what circumstances itmight be possible to establish a Turkish base. As regards the conclusion of anagreement to cover the statement of December 1956, I said that this would beconsidered at the time of the conference. Finally, I said that I would consider whether or not to name the Archbishop in that part of the draft statementdealing with the termination of the emergency.5. I gave the Turkish Ministers a revised draft of the statement and sent them from London a memorandum setting out our final position in regard to the various points which had been raised during the talks. Copies of these documents are attached (Annexes A and B). The penultimate paragraph of the memorandummakes it clear that my assurances to the Turkish Ministers particularly in regard tothe conference on strategic requirements only become effective if we proceed withthe statement.Discussions with the Greek government. Although the Turkish Ministers did not retreat in any way from theirinsistence on partition as the final outcome and indeed demanded the immediateestablishment of a base as a guarantee of this outcome, it seemed to me not unreasonable to hope that they might with careful handling be persuaded to acceptthe base as an alternative to partition, particularly if they were convinced of ourown determination to remain in Cyprus. The purpose of my visit to Athens wastherefore to see whether there was any prospect of reconciling the Greek demandfor self-determination with the idea of a Turkish base.Warning to the Greek Government on Dangers Ahead7. The Greek Government were not shown the draft statement at any timeand I did not put forward any specific proposals during my conversations with thePrime Minister, M. Karamanlis, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, M. Averoff,which took place on 11th and 12th February. I concentrated mainly on theincreased dangers of communal strife in Cyprus and the probability that any furtherviolence, whether on the part of EOKA or the Cypriot Turks, would make partitioninevitable. The Governor of Cyprus, who accompanied me, was able to drive thispoint home. I think it made a considerable impression.Greek Reaction to the Turkish Position8. On the other hand the Greek Ministers showed little understanding of theTurkish Governments anxieties for the security of the Turkish mainland. they maintained that any legitimate preoccupations on this score could be met by treaty provisions, for example the kind of guarantees which were provided for in the concept of qualified independence previously put to me by M. Averoff in New York(and also by M. Spaak, the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO)). They reacted unfavourably, as was to be expected, to theidea that the Turks might be given a base before the future of the island was finally decided. They argued that the question did not arise unless and until Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment themselves withdrew from Cyprus entirely. As to this, I took theline that, although the statement of December 1956 stood, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would naturally be prepared to entertain any solution which was acceptable to the Greek and Turkish Governments as well as to the Cypriots.Although the Greek position was self-determination without the possibility of partition, I thought that there should be room for compromise on the basis thatCyprus should advance towards self-determination as a unitary State within a fixednumber of years, provided that Turkey&apos;s strategic requirements were met by theintroduction of a Turkish enclave at an appropriate stage in the constitutional
development of the island. I made it clear that no suggestion in this direction hadbeen made by me to the Turkish Government and that it would be a majoroperation to induce them to accept a compromise on these lines.The Greek Position : Independence9. The Greek Ministers said that their official position was still self-determination. However, they developed at some length the independence solution.This v/as that the island should remain as a unit; after a short period ofself-government it should be given independence within the Commonwealth bindingitself not to seek to change its international status for a further period of years; itshould submit to obligations regarding minorities, and also with regard to foreignpolicy and armaments; the change in status might be subject to a vote in the united nations. The new State should become a member of NATO. They would accept this independence solution if Her Majesty&apos;s Government cared to put it forward.They would not comment on my ideas of a compromise then and there since it had only been mentioned in general terms, but if it were elaborated they would study it.Later I was given certain private indications that, if Her Majesty&apos;s government decided to impose a compromise solution on these lines, the Greeks would in factaccept it.Next Steps10. I did not attempt to reach agreement with the Greek Ministers as to ournext steps. I referred to the possibility of a tripartite conference on the Cyprusquestion as a whole, our invitation to which still held, and also to the possibilityof a conference limited at least ostensibly to strategic requirements. The Greekreaction was negative in both cases. They preferred the idea of bilateralconversations conducted by Her Majesty&apos;s Government with the Greek and turkish governments separately.Communique11. I attach the joint communique issued at the conclusion of the Athens talks(Annex C). The main point of interest is that, during the drafting of paragraph 2,M. Averoff said that the Greek Government could never associate themselves withany disapproval of EOKA even by implication. (&quot; To you they may be terrorists:to our people they are fighters for freedom.&quot;) This paragraph had accordingly torefer to the British view alone.British Bases under British Sovereignty12. Throughout the discussions in both capitals it was made clear by me that whatever happened, British bases under British sovereignty would remain in the island. This was accepted by Turkish and Greek Ministers.Personalities13. In seeking some compromise, we are up against a problem in thepersonalities involved. M. Menderes, the Prime Minister of Turkey, is a man ofbroad views, but under considerable pressures, political and economic. M. Zorlu,the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, is almost not negotiable. He is about aseasy to deal with as the Communist Prime Minister of North Korea during the korean armistice negotiations. M. Karamanlis is honest, but timid. He has aferocious Opposition and Press to face and his own team is not loyal. M. Averoffwas rather more impressive than before, but is an extremely wily negotiator. Howfar he is capable of being straightforward in this sort of situation I do not know.14. I am submitting separately a short paper on what action should now betaken.S.

ANNEX a revised DRAFT OF STATEMENT IN parliament rise to make a statement on Cyprus. The Governor is repeating this statement in Cyprus to-day. I have also authorised him to make an announcement on measures to bring the emergency to an end in three months. The steps whichit is proposed he should take will be dependent on peaceful and orderly conditions prevailing in the island. I shall refer to this further at the end of my statement.Her Majesty&apos;s Government have made persistent efforts to achieve agreementwith the Greek and Turkish Governments on the question of the future of Cyprus.In particular, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have for some time past done their utmost to bring about a conference between the three Governments. Moreover,Her Majesty&apos;s Government have repeatedly made it clear that they will give the closest consideration to any proposal agreeable to both the Greek and turkish governments and to both communities in the island. Unfortunately, so far theGreek Government have refused to attend such a conference except uponconditions unacceptable to Her Majesty&apos;s Government. Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenthave, therefore, reviewed the position in consultation with the Governor, and havemade the following decisions, which leave open the final solution:  (1) Her Majesty&apos;s Government have already declared their acceptance of theprinciple of self-determination. That declaration is reaffirmed, and her Majesty&apos;s Government now further declare their intention to achieve a settlement of the Cyprus problem on the basis of that principle seven years after the end of the emergency.(2) Her Majesty&apos;s Government at the same time stipulate as fundamentalconditions of such a settlement:  (a) that questions affecting the Turkish community in Cyprus are fairlysettled;(b) that such bases and installations as may be required to meet thesecurity and strategic requirements of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand their allies, in particular for geographical reasons Turkey,are retained.(3) With regard to the first stipulation, Her Majesty&apos;s Government reaffirmtheir assurance that the Turkish-Cypriot community, no less than theGreek-Cypriot community, should be given the freedom to decide for themselves their own future status, i.e., that the Turkish-Cypriots, no less than the Greek-Cypriots, are entitled to exercise their right ofself-determination as a community.(4) With regard to the second stipulation, Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs bases and installations will be under British sovereignty. So far as the strategic requirements of their allies are concerned, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment are prepared to hold a conference as soon as possible toconsider these matters, it being clear that the final decision on thesematters will remain with Her Majesty&apos;s Government.(5) During the seven-year period the people of Cyprus will be given theopportunity of working a system of representative institutions. her majesty&apos;s Governmenfs purpose is that the form of these institutionsshould be a matter for discussion and agreement between the governor and representative leaders of the two communities in the island.(6) The announcement which the Governor is making to-day on measures tobring the emergency to an end will, I hope, provide a suitableatmosphere for the introduction of a representative Constitution. Acopy of the Governors announcement will be available in the librarywhen I sit down. It provides for a progressive release over a period ofthree months of those detained under the emergency regulations andfor the revocation of the regulations at the end of that period, after which Archbishop Makarios and the three others excluded with himwould be free to return to Cyprus. All cases of those convicted duringthe emergency would then be reviewed by the Governor in ExecutiveCouncil. These measures for terminating the emergency will be dependant on the continuance of a state of tranquillity.
ANNEX BMEMORANDUM SENT TO TURKISH GOVERNMENTHer Majesty*s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs values the friendlydiscussions on Cyprus which he had in Ankara with the Turkish Prime Ministerand Minister for Foreign Affairs. As he said at the meeting on 31st January heand his colleagues have gone as far as possible in the spirit of Anglo-Turkishco-operation to meet the points put forward by the Turkish Government.It is essential that there should be no misunderstanding between Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Turkish Government. Accordingly Her Majesty&apos;s Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs wishes the Turkish Government to know hisunderstanding of the position reached at the discussion on the various points mentioned in the Turkish memorandum of 1st February. This is as follows:  (1) Her Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he did not see any great difficulty in incorporating a reference to the colonial secretary&apos;s statement of 19th December, 1956, in the proposed statement to be made by Her Majesty&apos;s Government but that he would considerwhether it was tactically wise.(2) Her Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wouldbe prepared to invite the Turkish and Greek Governments to aconference which would convene in a matter of weeks to consider thesecurity and strategic requirements of Turkey and also the strategic requirements of Greece. At this conference it would be possible todiscuss among other things the question of a Turkish base in Cyprus.Greece would&quot; not have a right of veto at the conference. If Greecerefused to take part there would be bilateral talks on the security and strategic requirements of Turkey between Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand The Turkish Government. At the conference Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would have positive proposals to make.(3) Her Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he wouldgive favourable consideration to amending point (5) of the draft statement to be made by Her Majesty&apos;s Government to make it clearthat both communities in Cyprus should each participate in exercising their rights within the framework of the Constitution.(4) Her Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that her majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared to consider favourably withthe Turkish Government at the time of the conference the possibilityof embodying in a formal document Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs pledgeof self-determination contained in the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statementof 19th December, 1956.(5) Her Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that he took note of the Turkish Governmenfs views about the reference to Makariosin Her Majesty&apos;s Governments draft statement. He said he would beprepared to consider omitting this reference though it might be worse than useless to do so since the first supplementary question her majesty&apos;s Government would be asked would be on this point and theywould have to reply with specific reference to Makarios on the lines ofthe relevant part of their draft statement.(6) Her Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs restated that nosubstantive steps in introducing a Constitution could be taken for sometime. Since Her Majesty&apos;s Government proposed to call the conferencewithin a matter of weeks no major political developments could in facttake place before the conference. Her Majesty&apos;s Secretary of Statemade it plain that he was referring to the political developmentsenvisaged in the draft statement and that his assurance did not mean that nothing would be done before the conference. For example, therewould be Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs statement and the Governor of cyprus might declare his readiness to convene separate Turkish-Cypriotand Greek-Cypriot consultative bodies.
The understanding of Her Majesty&apos;s Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on the points stated above relates to the situation which will become actual whenHer Majesty&apos;s Government make their proposed statement.The Turkish Government will observe that in recording the understandingon point (2) above reference is made to &quot; the security and strategic requirementsof Turkey.&quot; In drafting their public statement Her Majesty&apos;s Government cannotgo further than this to meet the views put forward by the Turkish Government onthis point. They will, however, be prepared to give consideration to the Turkishsuggestion for some bilateral assurance amplifying this phrase.ANNEX CJOINT COMMUNIQUE ISSUED AT CONCLUSION OF TALKS IN ATHENSDiscussions took place on 11th and 12th February between the british foreign Secretary, Mr. Selwyn Lloyd, and the Greek Foreign Minister,Mr. Evangelos Averoff, on the question of Cyprus. On 12th February,Mr. Selwyn Lloyd was received by the Greek Prime Minister, Mr. ConstantineKaramanlis, and had a discussion with him and with Mr. Averoff.Mr. Selwyn Lloyd explained the point of view of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand stressed the risks inherent in the present situation in Cyprus. He outlinedvarious ways by which he thought progress could be made and emphasised theimportance of restraint and moderation on all sides in order that efforts to achieve a settlement should have a chance of success.The Greek Foreign Minister explained in detail the principles on which Greekpolicy towards Cyprus was based and the reasons which made it necessary fora solution to take account of these principles.Although their views did not coincide on some basic points, the ministers agreed that their conversations had been of mutual benefit and that they would further study each other&apos;s views.
