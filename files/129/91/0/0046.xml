THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1958C. (58) 46 Copy No.20th February, 1958 &quot;*&quot;-&apos;&quot;&apos;CABINETROAD programme memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil AviationFollowing the discussion on the Severn Bridge project in Cabinet on12th December, 1957, I was asked to arrange for a review to be undertaken ofthe strain which major civil engineering projects were likely to impose on theresources of the industries concerned in the years ahead, and to submit proposalsfor a satisfactory spacing of these projects (C.C. (57) 84th Conclusions, Minute 9).2. The main British projects, many of which are under construction or are about to start, are as follows:  ProjectTunnels *Dartford*Clyde 1*Clyde 2TyneBlackwallBridges *Barton* Runcorn-Widnes* Kings-ferryForthSevern  millions11 06-754-013 09-03&apos;2-11515Construction1956-621957-611960-631959-651959-641957-601956-601957-601958-631960-65* Already begun or authorised.I am now principally concerned with the Tyne and Blackwall Tunnels and the severn Bridge, which I have provisionally included in my road programme at the dates shown, though no public announcement has yet been made.3. The case for the Tyne Tunnel rests on the fact that it would form a necessary link between highly-industrialised areas with a population of1-5 million. At present the heavy cross-river traffic either has to make the considerable detour to Newcastle or use ferries which are slow and uncertain. Theduplication of Blackwall Tunnel is even more urgently required as the presenttunnel is seriously overloaded and is too narrow for modern traffic. Accidentsand hold-ups in the tunnel frequently occur, but with a second tunnel the presentaverage journey time of 20 minutes could be cut to 3^ minutes. The economic advantages of a new Severn Bridge are self-evident since there is at present no roadcrossing of the Severn below Gloucester. Detours of traffic of anything up to50 miles would be avoided for an estimated volume of traffic of about 10,000vehicles a day. The advantages to South Wales in particular would be very substantial.4. Somewhat different considerations arise as between the two tunnels andthe Severn Bridge, but on all of them I have taken the expert advice of the53050
Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors, the British Constructional SteelworkAssociation and the Export Group for the Constructional Industries. Their advice to me is unanimous and is as follows.5. (a) The programme set out in paragraph 2 above can be carried out without any undue strain upon the industry&apos;s resources of labour, materials and finance and without impairing export interests.(b) The prestige gained by the successful completion of the Forth and SevernBridges would be of great value abroad to the reputation of the Britishconstructional industry.(c) Special problems arise in the case of the Forth and Severn Bridge projects.A consortium of the three largest steel bridge building firms in the country hasbeen agreed for the Forth Bridge contract, subject to proper costing safeguards,and the industry&apos;s view is that important economies in cost could be secured forthe Forth and Severn Bridge contracts if they were phased as indicated inparagraph 2 above so that skilled staff and specialised plant for the superstructurework could be moved from one job to the other at the most appropriate time.(d) Up to 75 per cent, of all work on ihe Forth and Severn Bridges would besubject to competitive prices.ie) It would not be possible for each of the three firms forming the consortiumfor the Forth Bridge contract to build up a team for the purpose of submittingcompetitive tenders for the Severn Bridge, but if the two superstructures couldbe treated as one job, the knowledge and experience gained would be put to thebest national advantage both practically and economically.(/) To introduce Continental bridge builders for the 25 per cent, of the work(approximately) on the Severn Bridge which will not be the subject of competitivetendering would do considerable harm to the prestige of the British industrywithout any counteracting advantage to the possibilities of British contractorsobtaining work on the Continent.(g) There are considerable precedents in other Government fields for theprocedure suggested above.6. After most careful consideration of the views expressed by the industry i have reached the conclusion that they should be accepted, and accordingly I seek the agreement of my colleagues to proceed in the following way:  (a) I should announce as part of my agreed  240 millions road programmethat the Tyne and Blackwall Tunnels will be authorised in the financialyear 1958-59, and that the Severn Bridge scheme will be authorised in the 1960-61 programme. I would propose to make an early announcement about Tyne. The L.C.C. have now informed me thatthey do not propose to proceed with the reconstruction of the AlbertBridge, and I would therefore announce Blackwall at the same time.I would agree the timing of the announcement on Severn with theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister for Welsh Affairs.(b) The negotiations with the consortium of contractors agreed for the ForthBridge should be extended to cover the carrying out of the highly specialised superstructure work on the Severn Bridge in the most economical way possible.H. W.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W.1,19th February, 1958.
