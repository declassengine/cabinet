(WIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 1023rd January, 1958 COPY NOCABINETTRADE WITH THE SOVIET union memorandum by the President of theBoard of trade the Foreign Secretary in C.(58) 9 says in paragraph 3(a) v/emust &quot;ourselves resist and organise others to resist&quot; the Communistthreat and in paragraph 6(e) he notes that &quot;progress is frankly dis-appointing&quot; in co-ordinating economic policy and effort includingmeasures against economic penetration by Communist States.2. The H Bomb has made a world war less likely. The struggleshifts to the economic field. Here the Soviets have the advantage of arapidly growing export potential and centralised direction. The free world has greater economic power but it is not effectively applied.The problem is how to combine free enterprise as the principle of oureconomies with that degree of strategic planning in international trade which the world of young, impatient and uncommitted nations demands.3.         It is worth noting that in the economic field the resources of theBritish Commonwealth (e.g. the proportion of international trade done in sterling) are, relative to those of the United States, greater than in themilitary field.   Our influence should, therefore, be more important.Nonetheless, the free world can only organise its economic resources under the leadership of the United States.   Here thei*e is a difficulty.   The United States does not at present enjoy the moral reputation-tion in this field which would entitle it to lead:   for two reasons -(a) The refusal to trade with the Communists is seen to befutile.   The Russian technical progress has dazzled everybody.   So longas the embargo exists the Russians can make a double propaganda out ofeach scientific discovery:   &quot;Look what we have done, and remember wehave done it in spite of the embargo&quot;.(b) It is probably true that the reason why the United states has given so much aid without strings, and has so often got so little inreturn, is because they maintain quotas on the import of agricultural products and tariffs against manufactured goods.   The Americans arehigh-minded lenders and low-minded creditors.   Countries such as the afro-Asians take note of this contradiction, grasp what is going, and thenfeel sore because they are allowed only restricted opportunities tobuild up their young economies by trade.   Hence the appeal of bulk-dealswith the Soviet.-1-9 5
r- f*0 0If the United States gave the advanced countries a stronglead towards very liberal trade policies the necessary basis wouldexist from which to prove that the free world&apos;s economic system wasaltogether more attractive than that of the Soviets.This is not, in our age, so heroic a suggestion.   for science and technology assure to the advanced countries the power toraise their standard of life much faster than the backward countries.The old fear of comparative wage costs makes little sense when automa-tion and computers do the work.   The United States are ahead and willdraw further ahead so long as their system of education is not neglected.4.        The Americans argue that the strategic lists of embargoed goodsmust not be reduced because imports into Russia-  would strengthen theindustrial base, and therefore the power of the Soviets to export and wageeconomic war (see V/ashington telegram No. 104).Against this I would say -(a) The Soviet economy will develop whether they import from us or not.(b) They can outwit the embargo through loopholes.(c) The embargo is a fine propaganda weapon in their hands.(d) It does not pay us to see the Soviet foreign trade concentrated on the uncommitted countries.(e) It is inconsistent to welcome a large extension of culturalexchanges but not of trade.(f) A fat Communist is less likely to make war than a thinCommunist.   The richer men are,the more middle-class they are, moreindependent in thought and less easy to govern.   This is the fundamental difference between the American point of view and ours.(g) The West needs a practical diversion from disarmamentwhere progress is unlikely and we are made to appear to be hangingback.   We could take the initiative in trade.   I would refer my colleagues to Moscow Despatch NS/1016/3 of 2 8th October, 1957, paragraph 5, fora vivid description of the Caucasian people&apos;s desire for more consumer goods.    Sir Patrick Reilly says &quot;The Soviet Government may soon have reason to apprehend a gargantuan growth in consumer demand&quot;.   this demand we could offer from the housetops to fill, but with little chanceof making an impression unless we are prepared to deal first with the embargo.   (See Mr. Krushchev&apos;s interview with the Editor of the daily express edition of 23rd December.)5.        How strong is resistance in the United States to pruning the embargo?   I found business opinion ready for a change in policy.   But,as Sir Harold Caccia has always told us, powerful  opposition exists in congress.   I formed the impression that Congress lags behind publicopinion on most things to do with relations with the Soviet.   unfortunately the managers of the Republican Party feel they cannot abandon a positionthey have held so strongly.
6.        We should have a better chance of selling to Mr. Dulles a sharp reduction in the strategic lists if it were presented as part of apolicy to counter the Russians&apos; economic offensive.   He is afraid of strengthening the Russian base because we have not organised theeconomic power of the free world and cannot be sure we can win theeconomic war.   But if we do not make ourselves strong enough to take on the Soviets in the economic field, treating them like any otherbuyer and seller, showing the rest of the world that our economic system in full competition with theirs is better than theirs, what chance have weof convincing those who are hesitant between the two ways of organisingan economy?7.        It follows that we need some kind of economic general staff orplanning machinery.   Mr. McCloy told me that in November he tried on mr. Dulles the idea of a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.)economic general staff and that Mr. Dulles answered that he couldapply the economic power of the United States better if he kept every-thing in his own hands.   Since then some leading bankers and business-men in the United States are thinking of economic planning on a narrowerfront than N.A.T.O.  I found both on the west coast and in Wall Streetmuch interest in this idea,   I should guess that progress here, as withthe embargo, can now only be made at a very high level.8.         My conclusions are -(a) the economic power of the free world must beapplied with more effect;(b) the leadership is with the United States;(c) but in this field the United Kingdom and theCommonwealth have a greater influence than inthe military field;(d) the elements of a successful organisation ofthe free world&apos;s resources are -(i)  the industrial countries to adopt veryliberal trade policies;(ii)  aid to be given only with strings;(iii) the embargo to go except for strictly military goods;(iv) in spite of the disappointing start injoint economic planning noted by theForeign Secretary we should maintainthe position tha^ this is a positive step which has to be taken, quietly no doubt,and at first perhaps only with theUnited States,, Canada and ourselves.D,E0Board of Trade, S.W,1.23rd January;, 1958
