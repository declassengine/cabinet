confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1958C (58) 37 Copy No.Nth February, 1958CABINETTERRITORIAL waters memorandum by the Minister of State for Foreign AffairsAn International Conference on the Law of the Sea will begin at Geneva on24th February. I circulate for the consideration of the Cabinet a memorandum prepared by officials of the Foreign Office in consultation with the Departmentsconcerned which poses in paragraphs 5 and 6 alternative policies on the breadth of the territorial waters the United Kingdom Delegation should be directed tosupport.2. Traditionally, and in the national interest on all counts, we support theprinciple of the 3-mile limit. But in recent years a rapidly growing number of countries have been claiming wider jurisdiction. It is accordingly most unlikelythat the 3-mile principle will carry the day at the forthcoming Conference. Itis true that we can ourselves stick to this principle, even if the Conference votesotherwise, but this will simply put us at a disadvantage with no substantialcompensation; it will pay us better, if the argument is going against us, to try to promote acceptance of something less good than the 3-mile limit, but betterthan the extremes (e.g., a 12-mile limit) for which some countries will press.3. The memorandum discusses two possible second-best policies on whichthe delegation might fall back if it becomes clear that the Conference will notuphold the 3-mile limit. Each possibility has advantages and disadvantages, and departmental interests are, for reasons set out in the memorandum, necessarilydivided. Paragraph 9 of the memorandum indicates what these Departmentalinterests are. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Scottish Officeand the Ministry of Power would prefer what is called in the memorandum the&quot; 6-mile proposal.&quot; The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, the AirMinistry, the Admiralty, the Ministry of Defence and the Colonial Office would prefer what is known as the &quot; Canadian proposal&quot; for a 3-mile limit coupled with a 12-mile exclusive fishery zone. Of the latter Departments, the Ministryof Transport and Civil Aviation, the Admiralty and the Ministry of Defence wouldin the last resort be prepared to accept the 6-mile proposal. The interest of theAir Ministry and the Colonial Office in avoiding an extension to 6 miles is,however, strong, and the interest of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and food and the Scottish Office in avoiding the &quot; &quot;Canadian proposal&quot; is equallystrong. The Chiefs of Staff could only accept a 6-mile limit if it were combined with a reservation of all air and sea passage rights as they exist at present on a3-mile basis. The Home Office and the Board of Customs and Excise are preparedto accept either proposal.4. The situation at the Conference itself will also no doubt affect our tactics.Subject to this, I invite the Cabinet to decide whether we should prefer an extensionof the territorial sea to 6 miles or a proposal made by the Canadian Government,with the probable support of the United States Government, that the 3-mile limit should be retained for all purposes except fisheries, for which the limit shouldbe extended to 12 miles.A. N.Foreign Office, S.W.1,12th February, 1958.53015b
UNITED KINGDOM POLICY ON THE BREADTH OF THETERRITORIAL SEAMemorandum by OfficialsA major International Conference on the Law of the Sea and other maritimematters to be held under the auspices of the United Nations is due to start on24th February in Geneva. One of the principal issues at the Conference will bethe question of territorial waters (breadth of the territorial sea) which hasincreasingly been a cause of international disagreement and friction.2. The principle of the &quot; 3-mile limit&quot; which was fairly generally acceptedbefore the war (although even then there were a number of defections) has recentlybeen in rapid decline. Probably not more than some 20 States now accept andapply it integrally, although these include some of the major maritime Powers suchas the United States, United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, the federal republic of Germany and Japan. Another major shipping nation, Norway (in common with the rest of the Scandinavian countries), accepts 4 miles. The greatmajority of States however assert claims to varying distances of 6, 9, or 12 miles, oreven further. It is probably only because the Conference is in prospect that anumber of other States which at present claim less than 12 miles have not alreadygone to that distance, and there is some indication that one or two Middle Easternor Asian States may yet proclaim a 12-mile limit before the Conference starts.3. The main (though not the only) impetus behind the flight from the 3-mileprinciple is the question of exclusive fishery rights which every State is entitled to reserve to itself within its territorial sea. Many of the newer nations, and some ofthe older ones, are engaged in coastal fishing and so have more to gain than to lose,in the short run at least, by extending their limits. Unless their fishing appetite canbe satisfied in some other way (and it is doubtful whether there is any such way which the deep sea fishery nations could accept without undue sacrifices), it is virtually certain that the Conference will reject the 3-mile principle considered asthe maximum permissible limit. The danger is that it will not stop at that but will proceed to adopt a 12-mile limit. Some countries are likely to press for more orfor no maximum limit at all. The fact that Russia and her satellites claim 12 andwill not budge from that position will be a powerful factor tending towards theadoption of that distance.4. While the United Kingdom Delegation at the Conference must strain everynerve to uphold the 3-mile principle, it is essential that it should have a &quot; fall-back &quot;policy for use if (as seems all too likely) these efforts are unsuccessful, andespecially with a view to avoiding the very serious development that would berepresented by a general adoption of a 12-mile limit for all purposes (defence, air navigation, fisheries, &amp;c). Theoretically such a development would not be formallybinding on the minority of countries not subscribing to it. But in practice in peacetime at any rate it would be difficult to counter. The 3-mile countries neednot themselves claim more than 3 miles, but would be unable to prevent othercountries from doing so and enforcing their claims. Resistance or forcible counter-action would be liable to lead to serious incidents and friction, which it is one of the aims of the Conference to lessen.5. The Inter-Departmental Territorial Waters Committee, after consideringthe views expressed by all other nations, have discussed the following two alternative policies (which of course would only be resorted to by us when it was clear that the 3-mile principle could not be upheld). The first, proposed by thelegal adviser to the Foreign Office, envisages an extension of the territorial sea to6 miles. Nothing less would stand any chance of acceptance, but the underlyingidea is that there will be a body of moderate opinion at the Conference, which willbe anxious to carry the major maritime Powers with it, and will therefore beprepared to settle for 6 miles provided countries like the United States and united Kingdom are willing in the last resort to go to that. If they are not, this body of moderate opinion may well swing over to the 12-mile limit.6. The second proposal, which has been made by the Canadian Governmentand will most probably be supported by the United States Government, would retain the 3-mile limit for all purposes except fisheries.   In respect of fisheries
however, the coastal State would enjoy exclusive rights up to 12 miles. the canadians originally intended to claim their territorial sea at 12 miles generally andfor all purposes, but were persuaded to modify this in the above sense. the underlying idea, at any rate in the United States view, would be to take advantageof the fact that the main impetus behind the claim to extended territorial waters isthe desire for increased exclusive fishery space, by buying off these States with an exclusive fishery zone of 12 miles, in return for the general acceptance of the 3-mile limit as the basic limit of territorial waters proper.7. Two points must be interjected at this stage. The first concerns theprinciple of the so-called &quot; contiguous zone.&quot; This is a belt of sea outside territorial waters in which the territorial State assumes the right to exercise certain limitedfunctions of a preventive character for sanitary, customs and fiscal purposes. Thecontiguous zone remains high seas, and is not under the actual sovereignty orjurisdiction of the coastal State. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have never specificallyaccepted the principle of the contiguous zone, but it is in fact almost universallypractised even by major maritime Powers such as the United States [e.g.,for customspurposes). There is fairly general agreement that the correct limit of the contiguouszone is at a distance of 12 miles from the coast, inclusive of the territorial sea.Consequently, on the basis of a 3-mile limit, there would be a contiguous zone forsanitary, fiscal and customs purposes of 9 miles. On the basis of a 6-mile limit,the contiguous zone would be 6 miles broad. If there were a 12-mile breadth of territorial sea, there would be no contiguous zone at all. On the basis of theCanadian proposal as described above, there would be a 3-mile limit for naval,air and navigation purposes with a contiguous zone of 9 miles for sanitary, fiscaland customs purposes, and in addition, in this total breadth of 12 miles, the coastalState would be entitled to reserve to itself exclusive fishery rights. Although thequestion of the contiguous zone is a complication, it does not affect the basicproblem of the belt of territorial sea over which the coastal State has actual and exclusive sovereignty.8. The second point is that consideration has also been given to the questionwhether it might not be possible to meet the appetite for increased fishery rightsby establishing an overall system of fishery conservation on the high seas, directed to ensuring that coastal States did not find the stocks of fish off their coasts depletedby extensive foreign fishing, in the hope that this might enable a number of states to agree to adhere to the 3-mile limit. However, it seems likely that the appetitesof coastal States would not be satisfied without their being given a very largedegree of control over the high seas fisheries in extensive areas off their coasts.From the deep sea fishery point of view, this result would be likely to be less acceptable than either of the others mentioned.9. The Departments represented on the Territorial Waters Committee havebeen unable to agree which of the alternatives in paragraphs 5 and 6 above is preferable. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Scottish Officeand the Ministry of Power would prefer the 6-mile proposal. The Ministry ofTransport and Civil Aviation, the Air Ministry, the Admiralty, the Ministry ofDefence and the Colonial Office would prefer the Canadian proposal to retain the3-mile limit with fishery rights extended to 12 miles. The Admiralty, Ministry ofTransport and Civil Aviation and the Ministry of Defence, however, realising thatan alternative policy may be necessary and inevitable, are prepared to accept the-mile limit if this seems to be the best way of avoiding further extension. TheChiefs of Staff, although concerned at any extension of the 3-mile limit, could accept the compromise of a 6-mile limit, provided that it were combined with a reservation and affirmation of all existing sea and passage rights to be retained asif 3 miles were still the limit, including the right of innocent passage for aircraftbetween 3 and 6 miles. The Home Office and the Board of Customs and Exciseare prepared to accept either proposal.10. The position of the Colonial Office is naturally complicated by the wide variety of geographical circumstances in the territories with which they areconcerned. Most Colonial territories would be glad to have extended the areaover which they have exclusive fishery rights and would, therefore, support theCanadian proposal. On the other hand some of the smaller Colonies would have difficulty in protecting any extension of their rights at sea. For the Colonies withrestricted approaches notably Gibraltar, Hong Kong and Singapore there arestrong defence (including the Royal Air Force) objections to any extensions of53015
territorial seas controlled by their neighbours. In these and some other cases onwhich neighbouring States may well prove unco-operative, any extension of thearea over which those States may legitimately interfere with free passage, &amp;c, isgenerally undesirable; and while under the Canadian proposals the operations of foreigners in their contiguous zone could be inconvenient, they would on the wholebe less embarrassing than the consequences of extended sovereignty up to the-mile limit.11. It is not known how other Commonwealth Governments will regard theCanadian proposal. New Zealand is inclined to accept it. Australia and theUnion of South Africa have favoured a 3-mile limit. India and Ceylon haverecently proclaimed extensions to 6 miles. Pakistan supports the principle of a uniform limit. Ghana would probably welcome an extension to help her fisheries.So far as is known, the Federation of Malaya has not yet formed any definiteviews.12.   The general arguments in support of the 6-mile proposal are:-^(a) It may be the only effective means of avoiding the adoption of a Zj-milerule. Even if 6 miles is not actually adopted, enough voles againsta 12-mile limit might be collected to block it.(b) A 6-mile limit would be much less of an evil to the United Kingdomfishing industry than 12 miles. The latter would deprive the distantwater trawlers, who account for over half the fish landed in the UnitedKingdom of about 20 per cent, of their total catch (about 40 per cent,round Iceland), and the near and middle water trawling fleet would lose about half their present catches at Faroe, another important fishingarea. Hull, Grimsby, Fleetwood and Aberdeen would all be gravelyimperilled, and large and important sections of the trawling fleetswould be crippled. Such losses would be completely unacceptable to the fishery Departments. The losses from a 6-mile limit shouldbe only about a third of those from a 12-mile limit, and while seriousthey might be bearable. There is no possibility of adequatelycompensating ourselves for the loss of fishing grounds elsewhere by extending our own limits.(c) The extension of the sovereignty of the coastal State to 6 miles would ensure our rights in respect of the exploitation of oil and mineralwealth of the continental shelf up to those limits, if agreement is not reached at the Conference on the question of the continental shelf though it probably will be.13. The main argument against the 6-mile idea (but it applies a fortiori toany greater extension of the territorial sea) is that aircraft, whether civil or military,do not enjoy any right of innocent passage through or over air space aboveterritorial waters. Any extension of territorial sovereignty to 6 miles would resultin the conversion of air space now over high seas into air space over territorial waters, which could be overflown only with the permission of the States concerned.Failure to obtain such permission (particularly in the areas of Gibraltar, singapore and the entrances of the Red Sea and Persian Gulf) would seriously prejudice our ability to maintain our strategic air communications to and within the middle and Far East.14. The main arguments in support of the Canadian proposal are asfollows:  (a) It would preserve the principle of the 3-mile limit and avoid any extensionof the actual sovereignty of the coastal State beyond that limit.(b) The main advantages, from the United Kingdom point of view, of preserving the 3-mile limit as such are:  (i) Strategic and reconnaissance. Warships and aircraft can getnearer foreign coasts.(ii) Passage. The right of passage for warships through territorial waters not consisting of international straits is contested.Therefore the narrower territorial waters are, the better.(iii) Navigational. With a 3-mile limit the coastal States would haveless opportunity to interfere with maritime shipping withinterritorial seas. An extension Of territorial limits would increase
navigational difficulties, particularly in the following respects:vessels would have greater difficulty in pin-pointing their position off coasts; visual aids (lighthouses, &amp;c.) would onlybe of use in extremely good weather; radar fixes on coasts wouldnot always be practicable. Again, if the territorial sea isextended, sheltered waters at present part of the high seas usedfor repairs, refuelling, &amp;c, might cease to be available to shipping,(iv) Security. The Admiralty would experience great difficulty in providing more vessels to patrol any extraterritorial sea (if we decided to claim up to the full permitted maximum).(c) A major advantage of the Canadian proposal is that by retaining the3-mile limit as the limit of State sovereignty, it would avoid the serious difficulty over the passage of aircraft indicated in paragraph 13 above.15. The main argument against the Canadian proposal is that it would entail all the disadvantages for United Kingdom deep sea fisheries outlined inparagraph 12(b) above. There is also a serious underlying danger in thedisassociation of exclusive fishery rights from territorial sea limits, which theCanadian proposal involves. The fact that extended fishery rights have hithertorequired extended territorial waters, has probably acted as some brake on fisheryclaims, although, for the same reason, it has also acted as a spur to claims toextended waters. Once the two are disassociated there will be nothing to preventfuture attempts to extend the exclusive fishery limit from 12 to 15 or 20 miles orfurther and this will be facilitated by the fact that no extension of territorial waters proper, or territorial sovereignty, would thereby be entailed. This wouldbe catastrophic for the distant water fleet and parts of the near and middle waterfleets and more than one-half of our fish supplies would be lost.16.   Further points to be noted are: (a) The Canadian proposal is likely to be put forward, either by Canada or some other country at an early stage of the Conference. If it is to be supported by the United Kingdom Delegation on the basis that theintegral 3-mile principle for all purposes (including fisheries) cannot be preserved, no special question arises. If not, however, and if theCanadian proposal is to be effectively countered by an alternative suchas the 6-mile proposal, this too may have to be made early, and it willbe essential for major maritime countries to take the lead in doing so,as its attraction will lie largely in the fact that it represents an extensionof territorial waters to which these countries are prepared to agree. Butthe indications are that the Americans will not join in this and will prefer the Canadian proposal.(b) The matter has been under consideration by the Joint Planning Staff andChiefs of Staff. Their conclusions, which view the matter purely fromthe standpoint of naval, military and air interests, would naturally tellin favour of the Canadian alternative ; but they also indicate that someextension of the territorial sea and of coastal sovereignty, though liableto cause difficulties of movement, would not be wholly unacceptableprovided it were accompanied by a specific reservation and reaffirmationof all naval and air passage rights as they would have existed if the3-mile limit had been retained. Whether such a reservation orreaffirmation could be obtained must, however, be open to some doubt.(c) The Conference is primarily to deal with the Law of the Sea in time ofpeace. If nothing to the contrary emerges, it might be possible to contend that any extended breadth of territorial sea agreed upon has no application under war conditions ; or else for the Western maritimePowers to declare that they only accept it on that footing. On the otherhand, the longer a generally accepted wider limit is in force in peacetime,the more difficult it will be to claim the right to revert to a 3-mile limitin war.(d) The Russians and their satellites are unlikely ever to agree to less than12 miles of territorial sea. Both the 6-mile and the Canadian proposal will therefore be unacceptable to them.Foreign Office,15th January, 1958.
