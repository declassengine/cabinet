secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1958C. (58) 1 Copy No. C2nd January, 1958CABINETEGYPT: FINANCIAL negotiations memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues will wish to know the course of the financial negotiations withthe Egyptian Government in Rome.The discussions which began on 4th November and were adjourned on11th December showed that it was almost certainly possible to reach agreementwith Egypt on the following points:  (a) desequestration of British property;(6) the removal of the other disabilities imposed on United Kingdom nationalsat the time of our intervention;(c) resumption of normal trade;id) compensation for British property that has been Egyptianised, with provision for impartial evaluation in significant disputes (the basis of valuation has still to be agreed);(e) an advance payment to Her Majesty&apos;s Government of compensation forEgyptianised property of  30 millions in the form of securities (certain technical points on this remain to be settled);(/) the removal of the restrictions on the No. 1 Account, resulting in a cashrelease to Egypt of  23-4 millions out of which will be paid whatever the Egyptians meet as &quot; pre-zero&apos;s.&quot; This sum might be as much as 5/6 millions, leaving a net figure of about  18 millions;(g) the resumption of pensions, compensation for dismissed British officials,return of securities held on behalf of British citizens in the names of egyptian branches of British banks and similar provisions.In addition we hoped to reach agreement on the exclusion from these negotiationsof Egyptian claims in respect of damage done during the intervention on the onehand and of our Governmental claims on the other. The Egyptians howeverhave not yet accepted this.2. So far we and the Egyptians have regarded these as items on which therewas broad agreement in the context of a wider agreement which would also define the extent of Egypfs liability for damage to British sequestrated property andregulate certain other matters.3. The two main points on which agreement could not be reached and which led to the adjournment of the talks were:  (a) Egyptian liability for damage done to sequestrated propertyThe Egyptians only admit liability for &quot; irregularities &quot; occurringduring sequestration, i.e., where Egyptian law had been infringed.This would exclude claims on account of mismanagement or of lootingbefore the sequestrators took over, and certain intangibles, such asinsurance policies, tax claims settled in favour of the egyptian government, and contracts of service. We should have no right toask for decisions taken or long-term commitments entered into by thesequestrator during his period of administration, to be set aside.52773
(b) The method of settling disputes about compensationWe asked for neutral arbitration. The Egyptians insist thatdisputes involving desequestrated property must be decided by theirCourts (though they are agreeable to impartial evaluation in the moreimportant cases where Egyptianised property is involved).4. We shall have to take the initiative in asking for the talks to be resumed.But before doing this we must decide how to break the present deadlock.5.   The choices seem to me to be as follows:  (a) to conclude a partial agreement which would cover those points on which agreement seems possible and leave for discussion later: (i) the problem. of compensation for desequestrated property; (ii) the question of anyfurther releases from the Egyptian No. 2 Account apart from the initialcash release of  18 millions;(b) to conclude an agreement broadly in the form offered us by the Egyptians;(c) to attempt to agree upon a lump sum settlement under which we wouldmake a cash release to them and they would make to us not an advancepayment of compensation, but a payment in full and final settlement;(d) to have no agreement at all.6.   Choices (b), (c) and (d) all seem to me to be undesirable.Choice (b) seems politically impracticable, because while we do not yetknow either the extent of the damage to sequestrated assets or its causes, itseems more than likely that only a small part of it will prove to be due to thesequestrator acting contrary to the Egyptian law. We should thus veryprobably be abandoning the greater part of our claims under this head, andconsequently make ourselves more vulnerable to the demand that her majesty&apos;s Government should compensate the claimants.Choice (c) is something to which Egypt would be most unlikely to consentunless we agreed that our share represented all that was due to us on all ourclaims. This would almost certainly leave a balance of British claims which her Majesty&apos;s Government would be pressed to meet. Moreover it would be extremely difficult to reach agreement on a figure for compensation in advanceof the return of our property and without any scrutiny of individual claims.Choice (d) is an extreme one, and hardly worth considering so long as there remains a prospect of securing an agreement on so many important aspects. Moreover it would have the serious international implicationsdiscussed below.7. The practical alternatives, therefore, are either to have a partial agreementor to have no agreement at all.8. If we have no agreement we shall be under great pressure from those whohave lost their property in Egypt to seize the Egyptian sterling balances and use them to pay compensation. This would be something which we could only do inthe last resort. To seize the balances unless we clearly had no alternative, wouldbe a further blow to international confidence in sterling. Moreover the balancesamount to a little over  70 millions whereas the assets (at the owners&apos; valuation)are worth  175 millions or more than twice as much. Finally, a solution on theselines would rule out any prospect of any improvement in Anglo-Egyptian relationsfor a long time to come.9.   The advantages of a partial agreement on the other hand are:  (a) that we should be able to resume current trade and restore diplomatic relations with Egypt;(b) that we should secure the return of property valued by the owners at 128-5 millions;(c) that we should secure an advance payment of compensation of at least 30 millions for Egyptianised assets. (If we were to use this money tomeet other claims, e.g., for sequestrated property, we should clearly doso at our own risk.)In return we should be making a cash release to the Egyptians of some  18 millions.
10. We should however have postponed for later discussion the claim for compensation in respect of desequestrated property. It might be said that if wecannot get a satisfactory settlement on this when we hold the whole of the Egyptianbalances, we are not likely to be able to do so once we have released  18 millions to them and received  30 millions as compensation leaving only  20 millions or sostill blocked. (This  20 millions would be subject to what may have to be deducted,say  7 millions, if and when the Egyptians allow refugees who do not wish to returnpermanently to Egypt to repatriate to this country the proceeds of selling theirdesequestrated property.)11. Much depends therefore on the value of the claims for compensation which we should be leaving over for settlement.at a later date. To make an exactestimate is extremely difficult. Indeed one of the arguments for leaving the questionover is that once British property has been desequestrated and the owners have returned to Egypt, they will have a far better idea of the state of their assets. Ingeneral, however, our claim for compensation would fall under two heads:  (a) damage or loss to personal property such as furniture, effects and vehicles.The total amount for such property declared to us is about  5 millions.A reasonable estimate might put the figure for damage at about 1 million, much of which probably took place as a result of lootingbefore the Egyptian Government took over the control of the property;(b) claims for damage to commercial assets (whether owned by private persons or by public companies) as a result of the acts of the sequestrator,e.g., in settling tax claims or other matters in dispute at the time whenthe sequestrator took over, or as a result of long-term contractsconcluded by him on manifestly uncommercial terms. It is extremelydifficult to form any estimate of the value of claims under this head.The largest claim is probably in respect of the assets of the shell company.12. If we accept a partial agreement we shall not have abandoned any ofthe claims in paragraph 11 above and at some future date the Egyptian Governmentmay be willing to come to an agreement in order to secure the release of theremaining  20/13 millions in the No. 2 Account. If, however, we were forcedultimately to reach a compromise on some of these claims and a claim were tobe made in consequence against the Exchequer, we should in my view havegood grounds for resisting it. In the last resort, however, it is clear that tomake some payment in respect of personal effects would not be too heavy a price to pay for a final agreement. The difficulty would be however to confine theExchequer liability to this narrow class of claim.13. The position is more doubtful on commercial and industrial assets.There is, as I have said, a risk of criticism from the owners if we release 18 millions to the Egyptian Government without getting any satisfactoryadmission of liability in respect of sequestrated property. I propose, therefore,that before negotiations are resumed, we should get in touch with some of theprincipal owners of sequestrated assets, especially the Shell Company, and tell them what we have in mind. We should put it to them that negotiations havenow gone on for several months and that in our judgment the choice lies between a partial agreement under which the claims for sequestrated property would not be finally abandoned, and having no agreement at all. Under the former alternative,the owners of sequestrated property will at least secure the return of their assetswhile the owners of Egyptianised property will secure compensation forEgyptianisation.14.   To sum up I recommend (a) that our delegation should be authorised to negotiate for a partialagreement on the lines proposed in paragraph 5 (a) above;(b) that before the negotiations are resumed, we should get in touch with theowners of some of the principal sequestrated industrial assets and put to them the case for proceeding on these lines.P.
