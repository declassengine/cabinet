(58) 33 Copy No.7th February, 1958CABINETDUTY-FREE PETROL FOR UNITED STATES SERVICEMEN IN THEUNITED kingdom memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsIntroductionDuring rhe past nine years discussions have taken place on and off with theAmerican Service authorities in this country (United States Third Air Force) aboutthe provision of a duty-free ration of petrol for members of the United Statesarmed forces stationed here. The original request by the Americans in 1948was intended to include petrol for private motoring. Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentrefused this request and the Americans then asked whether it would be possibleto provide a duty-free ration of petrol for United States servicemen to use intheir private cars on duty journeys. The majority of these duty journeys wouldbe between home and base, although there would be cases in which officiallyauthorised journeys were undertaken in private cars.2. Departments agreed at the official level that this request was reasonable and should as far as possible be met. Discussions were therefore held betweenCustoms and Excise and representatives of the United States Third Air Force towork out the details. As a result of these discussions a scheme was agreed which seemed to be workable with a negligible degree of abuse. The approximate costto the revenue would be  14- millions per annum.problem. Before final approval was given to implement the scheme it was thought desirable to give further consideration to the likely public and Parliamentaryreactions and for Ministers to discuss this. As my colleagues know, parliament and Press are normally hostile to any extension of privileges to foreigners in thiscountry. It is therefore possible that the announcement of such measures would provoke some critical comment.4. The arguments in favour of the scheme are however strong and most ofthem could be developed in answer to criticism. They are as follows:  (a) Feeling in the United States Air Force is running high. It would be furtherembittered if after all this time we were now to refuse what is essentially reasonable request.(b) The United States forces in the United Kingdom are one of our biggestdollar-earning assets. It is common sense and good business not to jeopardise this.(c) In a number of other North Atlantic Treaty Organisation countriesincluding France and Germany (and some outside NATO) United states forces receive much more generous treatment than is proposed here.(d) The proposed concession accords both with the letter and the spirit ofArticle XI of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement which providesthat &quot; A force may import free of duty the equipment for the force52982
and reasonable quantities of provisions, supplies and other goods forthe exclusive use of the force and, in cases where such use is permitted by the Receiving State, its civilian component and dependants.&quot; Thebenefits which United States troops get in this respect in other NATOcountries are based upon the NATO Status of Forces Agreement.(e) It is the policy of the United States Government to provide housing onbase for their servicemen. However in the United Kingdom theirservicemen are obliged in many cases to live a long way away from theirbases.(/) There will be some corresponding advantages to United Kingdom military personnel in the United States where legislation in such matters isbased on reciprocity.Recommendation5. I therefore ask my colleagues to approve the provision of duty-free petrolto United States servicemen on the lines described above.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W.1,6th February, 1958.
