secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1958C. (58) 24 Copy No. 5 \28th January, 1958CABINETWAGES  POLICY:  RADIOGRAPHERS  IN THE  NATIONAL  HEALTHSERVICEMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in their paper, C. (58) 23, the Health Ministers conclude that a substantial increase of pay should be offered to radiographers. They say that this is necessaryin order to recruit and retain more radiographers in the hospital service, which is atpresent suffering from an acute shortage of them, and they argue that if properlyand effectively presented it can be distinguished from inflationary pay concessions.I am afraid that I cannot agree.2. The radiographers last had a pay increase as a result of arbitration inNovember 1956, only a few weeks earlier than the administrative and clerical grades in the Health Service, whose recent pay award was vetoed, and a few weeks later than the New Towns staff to whom a pay increase has been refused. Any payaward to the radiographers will, therefore, be taken as a relaxation of our policyunless it can be convincingly demonstrated that the radiographers&apos; case is of anentirely different character from other pay claims which are before us or in prospectand which we have got to resist. I submit that it cannot be so demonstrated forthe following reasons:  (i) The claim before the Industrial Court in 1956 was for a far greater increasethan was in fact awarded and was supported inter alia by the argument that such an increase was necessary to make good the shortage inestablishment. In awarding little more than was justified by the increasein the cost of living, the Court implicitly rejected the claim for asubstantial revaluation on grounds of shortage. The shortage then was15 per cent. According to the latest available information, the figure isprecisely the same to-day. How then can we admit it as a validargument for better treatment than has been given in the other casesreferred to above?(ii) The Health Ministers say that the Industrial Court might well reject a staff side claim if the matter now went to arbitration again. This is to admit that the merits of the case are not self-evident to reasonable men.3. In these circumstances, I can see no hope of persuading other Unions, suchas those concerned in the administrative and clerical pay claim, or the public ingeneral, that this is an altogether different type of claim. I therefore conclude thatwe must stand firm and refuse to make any offer of increased pay to theradiographers.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,27th January, 1958.52910
