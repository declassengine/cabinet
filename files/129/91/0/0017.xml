LONDON BUS DISFUTEMemoiandum by the Minister of Labour and national service realise that there will be serious diffciulties whether or notI set up a Committee to deal with the London bus dispute.   I have given full weight to the objections raised, and I share many of the doubtsexpressed.   But there is no simple solution.2.        To refuse to set up a committee would be a complete departure from normal procedure.   To appoint a body of the kind suggested is thevery least I could do when called upon to assist in a dispute.   A refusalv/culd certainly be construed in the present atmosphere as a challenge bythe Government to the unions, who would be able to say that it was in conflict with recent pronouncements by Government spokesmen that therewas to be no inteference with the normal procedure.3.        A refusal would almost certainly result in a strike, which wouldnot be confined to the buses, and might cover the whole transport fieldincluding railways and docks.   More important still it would appear tobe a strike against the Government and not against the London transport executive.   V/e must not get into this position.4.        It has been suggested that I should refuse a committee but should press arbitration instead.   Apart from the fact that the Londonbusmen have repeatedly rejected arbitration, I think that a committeewould have certain advantages over the normal forms of arbitration.   Inthe first place, I should appoint the chairman of the committee, and it is obviously of the greatest importance that he should be someone who under-stands the seriousness of the issues involved;  moreover, the employers&apos;representative would be nominated by the London Transport executive and it would clearly be advantageous to have in this capacity a strongpersonality, fully seized of the attitude of employers generally in thepresent situation.   (The London Transport Executive have put forward twovery suitable names.)  The third member would be a nominee of the tradeunion.   A further reason for preferring a committee to arbitration isthat with the latter there is either an express or an implied obligation on both parties to accept the arbitrators&apos; award.   The committee would bereporting only to the parties and in the form of suggestions which either side could reject.-1-THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of-......---------------.....______TOP SECRET Copy No.-JOTC,.(5G) 3.723rd January, 1?5G&quot;CABINET
TOP SECRET845.        My idea about the terms of reference is as follows -&quot;To examine the position arising from the claim of theTrasnport and General Workers1 Union for an increase in wages of all employees covered by the agreements betweenthe London Transport Executive and the Union and theconfirmation of the Executive that they were not preparedto offer any increase in wages at present, and to reportto the parties. &quot;6.        I think it might go a long way to meet any possible criticism of Government action if I gave to the Press copies of a covering letterfrom the Ministry to the parties making it absolutely clear that thecommittee is set up only because the parties have asked for it, and thatits report is only to the parties and will not call for or imply government action.conclusion.        1 recognise that this is an important decision.   Either way i cannot escape criticism.   But I believe after full consideration that thebalance of argument is clearly in favour of setting up the committee.The most inconspicuous time I could pick for this would be late on Fridayevening for Saturday morning papers.   It would be very difficult to explainfurther delay than this.I.M.Ministry of Labour and NationalService, S0W.l.23rd January, 1958
