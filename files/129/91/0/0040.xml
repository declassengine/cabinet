/secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1958C. (58) 40 Copy No.11th February, 1958CABINETINTERMEDIATE RANGE BALLISTIC MISSILESMemorandum by the Minister of defence at their meeting in Bermuda last spring, the Prime Minister and the Presidentagreed that the United States should supply Great Britain with intermediate rangeballistic missiles, to be deployed in four squadrons of fifteen missiles each. the squadrons would be manned and operated by the Royal Air Force as soonas sufficient officers and men had been trained in America; if missiles were ready for deployment before this stage had been reached, the United States Air force would man some of the squadrons until the R.A.F. were ready to take them over.The Americans would provide the missiles and specialised equipment free of cost;Great Britain would meet the cost of constructing the sites.2. The negotiation of the detailed Agreement is now almost complete. It willtake the form of exchanges of letters between Her Majesty &quot;s Ambassador atWashington and the United States Secretary of State. One set of letters will cover a Memorandum of Agreement setting out what each party undertakes to do;&apos;allthese documents will be published. A second set of letters, which will be secret,sets out those parts of the Agreement which, for reasons of security, cannot be made public, and also provides that, if the United States Government should at any timein the future wish to make proposals for the deployment of additional squadrons of missiles in Great Britain, to be manned and operated either by the United states air Force or the Royal Air Force, Her Majesty&apos;s Government will give such proposals prompt and sympathetic consideration. The United States Governmenthave made it clear that they have no such proposals in mind at present.&quot;3. Copies of all these documents in their present state of drafting are atAnnexes 1 to 5.4.   The chief points to which I should draw the Cabinefs attention are:  (1) without cost to us, the Americans will supply the missiles and specialisedequipment and will train British personnel in the United States to operate them;(2) we are to provide the sites and certain supporting facilities, such ascommunications, the capital cost of which is estimated at about 10 millions; but this figure is subject to revision. In return for this, the americans have taken over a dollar commitment of a roughly equalamount for the purchase for the Army of Corporal missiles. These will now be provided free of cost under the Military Assistance Programme;(3) each of the four squadrons of missiles will be dispersed over five sites.The sites will be located on active or disused airfields belonging to theAir Ministry in Norfolk, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. The final choice of sites will depend on the result of a survey;(4) the operational use of the missiles will be a matter for joint decision bythe British and American Governments;(5) the nuclear warheads for the missiles will, in accordance with United Stateslaw, remain in American custody. These American missiles cannot,of course, be regarded as an element of independent British nuclear power; but they represent a valuable addition to the combined strengthof the allied strategic deterrent;53002B
(6)&apos; Since: the Thor missile may not be fully developed when deployment in britain begins, the Agreement provides for modifications to beundertaken by, and at the expense of, the United States Government tomake the equipment capable, in the opinion of experts of both countries,of satisfactory operational performance;(7) the nuclear warheads will always be in a fully assembled state and will normally be permanently positioned on the missiles. The missiles willincorporate a number of safety features designed to prevent aninadvertent nuclear explosion;(8) detailed arrangements to implement the Agreement are being negotiatedseparately between the Air Ministry and the United States Air Force.These contemplate that the first squadron will be deployed betweenJuly and December, 1958, the second by mid-1959 and the remainingtwo by March, 1960. It will be necessary to reserve our position forthe present on this timing, as there are a number of problems of planningclearance, priorities and other practical difficulties which must be looked into first. The Secretary of State for Air is considering submitting aseparate paper on these to the Cabinet.5. I invite the Cabinet to approve the conclusion of an Agreement in the terms proposed in the Annexes to this memorandum.D.

ANNEX 4(Not to be Published)Document 4(Draft of letter from United States Government about the secret provisionsof the Agreement)1.   I write with reference to the exchange of letters of ,constituting an Agreement between the Governments of the United Kingdom andthe United States on intermediate range ballistic missiles.2- Confirming discussions between representatives of our two Governments,four squadrons of &quot;fifteen missiles each will be deployed in the United kingdom as rapidly as practicable.3. The United States Government will provide at its expense in amountsand kinds appropriate to five years of operation:  (i) Missiles.(ii) Specialised equipment.(iii) Training facilities and training missiles.(iv) Spare parts as required to maintain the missiles and specialised equipment in an operational condition.(v) Modification kits, modified components or assemblies, or such factorymodifications of the missiles and specialised equipment as may beagreed to be necessary.4. It is understood. that the United Kingdom Government will provide at its expense:  (i) Land, appropriately prepared sites, and supporting facilities, includingutilities, buildings and other fixed installations.(ii) Supporting equipment, including such items of common ground supportequipment for units and bases as may be agreed upon, and such items of a technical nature as may be agreed shall be produced in theUnited Kingdom.5. It is recognised that material, equipment and training to be furnishedpursuant to the Agreement will serve the same general purpose as that for whichfunds were originally earmarked in support of Plan K and that such aid will,therefore, be financed in so far as practicable from funds already earmarked forthe United Kingdom in support of Plan K.6. Representatives to be nominated by the two Governments shall agreethat the missiles and specialised equipment to be supplied under the agreement are capable of satisfactory operational performance. Should it be agreed betweenthe two Governments that missiles and specialised equipment which are not initiallycapable of satisfactory operational performance should nevertheless be deployedin the United Kingdom, the United States Government will supply modificationkits, modified components or assemblies, or undertake factory modifications, inorder to ensure that the missiles and specialised equipment are made capable ofsatisfactory operational performances. Any replacement of missiles alreadysupplied to the United Kingdom by missiles of a higher standard of performanceor the provision of major assemblies and specialised equipment related to suchhigher standard would be the subject of separate negotiations.9. The arrangements recorded herein are made in consonance with the north atlantic Treaty and in pursuance of the Mutual Defense Assistance Agreementbetween the United Kingdom Government and the United States Government,signed January 27, 1950, as supplemented, and related agreements, and are subjectto the applicable provisions thereof.10.
