secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1958C (58) 41 Copy No.20th February, 1958CABINETBALLISTIC MISSILESMemorandum by Secretary of State for AirI have been invited by the Home Affairs Committee to report to the cabinet certain points about the deployment of American ballistic rockets (Thor) in thiscountry (H.A. (58) 3rd Minutes, Item 1). These points will bear directly on certain aspects of the Minister of Defence&apos;s statement to the House of Commons aboutthe Agreement on this subject with the United States Government.2. The American Government want to keep to a timetable under which thefirst of the five sites needed for the first squadron should be ready for its threemissiles by July 1958 and the fifth site by the end of the year. This paper is written on the assumption that we keep to these dates whatever arrangements are made about the manning of the first squadron.3. The Home Affairs Committee approved in principle that the details ofthis deployment should be kept secret. Though we may be criticised for classifyingas secret a weapon which when established will very often be clearly visible, weshould be making a present of intelligence a long time before the last weapon isdeployed if we revealed the detailed location of sites now. There are still strongersecurity objections against revealing such details as the relationships betweensites and the system of command and control. Finally, it would be quite wrong to give the deployment of Thor, which is a nuclear weapon, a lesser securityclassification titan that of other RAF. weapons.4. To prevent publication of details in the Press it is necessary to issue a&quot; D &quot; Notice and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has asked me to bringthe attached draft, which the Home Affairs Committee have approved, to theCabinet. If we take this action with our own Press it is clearly essential that weshould ensure that the United States Government and the United States Air Forcedo not adopt a different security policy in respect of Thor. Action is being taken with Washington on this point.5. A decision on secrecy would have a considerable effect on what action we take to consult local authorities and private interests. I have discussed theposition with the Attorney-General.6. On the one hand there is the Governments policy, emphasised by the franks Committee, of giving local interests affected by a proposal by a defence department to acquire or to exercise rights over land, even when secret, everyreasonable opportunity to object and have enquiries made into their objections(Cmnd. 218). Although this policy does not directly apply to this case because we shall be using active or inactive airfields which already belong to us, it couldbe argued that the spirit of our policy requires a procedure for hearing objections.The siting of rockets on inactive airfields in particular will constitute a changeof use. And, provided security considerations do not arise, local opinion would normally be granted a hearing. On the other hand this project has certain specialfeaturesi; there- is no room for manoeuvre as regards the detailed location of sites53046b
which are fixed by complicated operational criteria once the broad area is settled and it would be contrary to British and American practice to pinpoint the location of nuclear weapons.7. In my view not only is the normal procedure of full consultationinapplicable in this case but so is the more limited procedure, which we usuallyapply to secret projects, of informing selected representatives of the Countyauthority concerned, which in fact gives them a chance to comment. The reasons are, firstly, that if we tell them the detailed sites they will know more than we are proposing to tell Parliament. This has been done in the past, but this project isattracting exceptional political and Press interest, and I think we would be criticised-if we took this step. Secondly, if we inform County authorities no useful purposev/ould be served except for the ventilation of objections. We would not be ableto satisfy them and would only irritate still more people as, for example, localresidents. The Attorney-General agrees with me on this. I would howeverpropose, as a matter of courtesy and good relations, to inform the Chairmen ofthe County Councils concerned that there will be a site or sites in their counties.This could be timed to coincide with the Governments announcement.8. I think the right course would be to make as full a statement as possibleto Parliament about our policy for deploying these weapons, in which we explain that the sites are being carefully selected in the light of a number of complexconsiderations, that they will all be on iand already owned by the Air ministry and that they will be in certain counties which we would list. We should alsostress that there is no question of launching these weapons in peacetime or even of test firing the rocket motors at these sites. It is for consideration whether wesay in the main statement, or reserve for supplementary answer, that because ofthese many factors and because we have taken every possible step to minimiseinterference with land, local interests, &amp;c, the Government have decided thatconsultation with county or local authorities would not be appropriate.9. As to the cost the broad sum is really determined by the main agreementbetween the two Governments. But there are important points of application.Firstly the money allowed in Air Estimates for 1958-59 is based on an earlier andslower American timetable of deployment and amounts to only  350,000. Secondlythe actual sum we shall spend in the coming financial year can be varied by two factors. If we do not consult local authorities we shall be able to get an earlierstart. If we use such practices as multi-shift working and schedule contracts, theywill increase the cost of the work.10. The increase in cost due to these accelerated measures would not be great.They will apply only to the operational part of the work and within that part might involve an increase of between 10 per cent, and 25 per cent. They will be requiredonly for the first squadron and to a lesser degree the second squadron. If we take these special measures and if we do not consult local authorities and both these decisions are necessary to keep to the timetable of deployment requested by the americans-the actual expenditure incurred in 1958-59 might on Air Votes amountto about  1-5 millions. There is no scope in my Works vote, which has alreadybeen severely pruned in spite of our policy to improve standards of accommodation,for finding this additional expenditure.11. I recommend that we should take these accelerated measures for the deployment of the first squadron and to a lesser degree for the deployment of thesecond squadron. I am confident that the work for the third and fourth squadronscan be carried out by normal fixed price contract without any multi-shift working.12. Expenditure also falls on the G.P.O. for the provision of the considerabletelecommunications network required. The Postmaster General is, I understand,satisfied that this work can be carried out in accordance with the tight time-tableprovided that it can be given priority in the military field. I can accept this condition. I am also informed that the Post Office are satisfied that theexpenditure which they may incur in the forthcoming year, amounting to up to 100,000, can be found out of their existing Estimates.I therefore recommend that:  (a) the deployment of Thor should be treated as secret: that appropriateinstructions should be issued to the Press and that close liaison shouldbe kept with the American Government;
(b) in the light of the many special factors about this deployment there shouldnot be the normal system of consultation with local authorities and private interests affected but that there should be a full statement inParliament supplemented by a personal letter from me to the chairmen of the County Councils concerned;(c) all necessary financial and contractual measures should be taken to getthe first squadron installed by the planned date but that I shouldrevert so far as possible to the normal fixed price contract for theremaining squadrons.G. R. W.Air Ministry, S.W. 1.18th February, 1958.AnnexBALLISTIC MISSILESDraft &quot; D &quot; NoticeI am directed by the Service, Press and Broadcasting Committee to inform you that from time to time the Government will make official announcementson the subject of sites in the United Kingdom concerned with the operation ofballistic missiles, with a view to giving as much information as security allows.This information may include broad geographical reference, by country or area,to the general locations of such sites.2. I am to request you, in the interests of national security, not to add to thisfactual information by publishing the number, precise localities or general layoutsof, or operational relationships between, any sites in the United Kingdom concernedwith the operation of these missiles. Finally you are asked not to refer, in such away as to impart information on these same matters, to any surveys being made ofsuch sites.
