Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1958C (58) 47 Copy No.20th February, 1958 - - - .CABINETARTIFICIAL INSEMINATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department andLord Privy Seal and the Secretary of State for ScotlandLord Wheatley&apos;s recent decision in the Court of Session, that artificial insemination of a woman without the consent of her husband is not adultery, andthe Primate&apos;s subsequent speech to the Convocation of the Province of Canterbury,have re-awakened public interest in the subject generally, and there is increasing pressure for action by the Government. There is to be a Debate in the House ofLords on 26th February.2. The last occasion when the subject came before Parliament was in 1949,when there was a Debate in the House of Lords in the course of which theGovernment of the day undertook to go into the matter. Since then the RoyalCommission on Marriage and Divorce have recommended that artificial insemination by a donor without the consent of the husband should be a ground for divorce or for judicial separation, and that artificial insemination with the husband&apos;s consent should be a bar to proceedings for nullity on the ground ofimpotence. But it was not within the R.oyal Commission^ terms of reference toconsider the wider implications of the practice, and it seems to us that some formof enquiry into the whole matter cannot now be avoided.3. We think that a Departmental Committee would be appropriate for thepurpose. A number of Departments are concerned with special aspects of theproblem but the practice has broad social implications in which no Departmentappears to have a predominant interest. We therefore consider that it wouldbe appropriate for us jointly to set up the proposed Committee, without prejudice to the ultimate Departmental responsibility for consideration of the Committee&apos;sreport.  The Lord Chancellor and the Minister of Health agree with this course.4. There seem to us to be two main aspects of the problem which theCommittee ought to consider. The first concerns the broad implications of thepractice of artificial insemination for individuals, families and society as a whole,and the second concerns the legal consequences of the practice for the woman, the husband, the donor and the child. Under the first heading are comprised such questions as the effect of artificial insemination upon society and upon family life;whether it should be prohibited; and if not, whether it should be regulated asregards the selection of donors and the conditions under which the practice is to be permitted. The second heading covers questions such as divorce law, legitimacy,the law of succession and the registration of births.5. We accordingly suggest that the Committee should have the following termsof reference:  (a) to  enquire   into   the   existing  practice  regarding  human   artificial insemination;(b) to consider whether, taking account of the interests of individuals involved and of society as a whole, the practice should be prohibited orregulated; and(c) to examine the legal consequences of the practice;and to make recommendations.53051THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
19th February, 1958.6. We suggest a small committee consisting of two members of the medical profession, two persons with legal experience and four or five lay men and women.Some of the members should be able to reflect opinions held in the Church ofEngland, the Church of Scotland and the Free Church Federal Council. TheChairman should be a layman.7. We invite our colleagues to agree that an Interdepartmental Committeeshould be set up as proposed above and that this should be announced in the debate on 26th February.R. A. B.J. S. M.
