THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1958C (58) 21 Copy No.24th January, 1958CABINETTHE PART-TIME DIRECTORS OF THE BANK OF ENGLANDMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on the subject of the part-time directors of the Bank of England the ParkerReport says the following:  &quot; It will be observed that our inquiries into the dealings of companies with which Lord Kindersley and Mr. W. J. Keswick were connected hasfocused attention on circumstances in which a Director of the Bank of England,who has other business interests, may find himself in a difficult andembarrassing position. This is particularly so in the case of a Director of theBank, who, like Mr. W. J. Keswick, is the one person to whom his businesscolleagues look for advice, and where he cannot escape his duty to give such advice. This raises a general and very important question of policy with whichwe are clearly not concerned. Had it been our duty to express an opinion onthis matter, we should, before doing so, have required exhaustive evidence asto the advantages and disadvantages of continuing a state of affairs which has so long existed.  The criterion, of course, must be the national interest.&quot;2. In my judgment, there is no occasion for us to adopt a defensive posture onthis or any other issue arising out of the Parker Report. It is the Opposition whoare on the defensive. Even on this particular question, on which their positionis certainly less embarrassing than it is on other aspects of the matter, it is worthremembering that the present organisation of the Bank of England is one which was substantially reaffirmed by them in the Bank of England Act, 1946; and that at thattime they attached importance to the inclusion in the Court of active members ofthe commercial community.3. The Parker Tribunal could hardly have indicated more plainly than theyhave that, if this matter had been within their terms of reference, they would havebeen unwilling to contemplate any precipitate action. By their reference to thelong existence of the present state of affairs they even suggest that the presumptionis against change.4. On the merits of the matter I would only observe that the present system ismore in conformity with our general philosophy than any alternative would belikely to be. It makes available to the Government and its central Bank the advice and counsel of active leaders of private enterprise in the management of the creditsystem. I set out in the Appendix a statement which the Governor of the Bankmade to the Parker Tribunal indicating the advantages of this arrangement. Thereis much force in what this memorandum says; and I suggest that we should be inno hurry to make changes in the direction which the Opposition would no doubtfavour and which would put the management of the Bank (under the supervision of the Chancellor of the Exchequer) more exclusively in the hands of a permanent,full-time bureaucracy.5. In my view, we should adopt the suggestion, which is implicit in the ParkerReport, that the matter should be carefully and impartially studied, but withoutacknowledging or implying that there is anything necessarily wrong with the present arrangements. The Radcliffe Committee is at present enquiring &quot; into the workingof the monetary and credit system.&quot;   My predecessor stated, in his Budget Speech52903
last year, that &quot; the Committee would review the working of the system in theconditions of to-day.&quot; Lord Radcliffe takes the view that this question ofthe constitution of the Court of the Bank of England and its functioning comes within the terms of reference of his Committee, and he had already been contem-plating dealing with it in the Report of his Committee. He would therefore be quite willing to accept a request that he should give specific attention to it. Ipropose, therefore, that I should ask the Radcliffe Committee to address themselvesto the question of policy referred to in the Parker Report and in so doing to take account of the Tribunals observations upon it. This move would be announced in the course of the debate in the House of. Commons.6. The alternative of an ad hoc enquiry into this matter (e.g., by a group ofPrivy Counsellors) would, in my view, be likely to cut across the work of the radcliffe Committee in that the constitution and functioning of the Bank ofEngland is an integral part of the &quot; working of the monetary and credit system &quot;which the Radcliffe Committee is reviewing. This alternative would, moreover,cause difficulties with the Court of the Bank of England.7. There are three concessions which could be considered. 1 would in factrecommend none of them.(a) We could ask Lord Radcliffe to produce an interim report on this matter,in advance of his general report. He would, I believe, be most unwilling to contemplate this, since he takes the view (rightly, as I judge) that thematter is bound up with the rest of the work of his Committee and cannot without serious disadvantage be separated from it. There wouldalso be difficulties with the Court of the Bank. There is, in fact, nourgency, since the Parker Tribunal, apart from hinting strongly thatthere is much to be said for the present system, have foundunambiguously that nothing has in fact gone wrong in the past.(b) Another possibility would be to alter, at least as an interim measure, thearrangements by which Bank Rate is determined every Thursdaymorning. Under such a change, Bank Rate would be considered bythe Court only when an alteration was in prospect instead of weekly;and changes would be made at any convenient time instead of beingmade almost always on a Thursday. Although there are certainlydisadvantages in the present system, I am not in favour of making animmediate change since any change whatever at this moment wouldbe taken as an indication that the Government consider the presentsystem to be so defective as to require immediate modification.   No&apos;n defence or apology of the present system is called for in the light ofthe Report and we should not appear to offer one. In any event this change would meet only to a limited extent the criticism that part-timedirectors have prior knowledge of a move in Bank Rate. And any modification of the system now would immediately provokecontroversy as to the adequacy of what we had done even as a stop-y-: gap measure. The Court of the Bank of England, whose responsibility.this primarily is, hold strongly the view that there should be no immediate change of practice for the reasons which I have expressed.They would, however, be quite ready to consider the point furtherafter and in the light of the Parliamentary debate on the Report.(c) The Governor of the Bank of England informs me that it is his intention,in any event, for the immediate future to restrict consultation with thepart-time directors about Bank Rate changes to the minimum that is practicable. This is obviously a sensible measure; But I would notannounce it, for the same reasons as those for which I would be reluctant to ask the Bank to make the change mentioned at (b) above.8.   I therefore seek the agreement of my colleagues to proceed as proposed inparagraph 5 above.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1. .....24th January, 1958.
APPENDIXStatement made by the Governor of the Bank of England to theParker TribunalI am very grateful to you for allowing me to read this. I would like to say,-first, that naturally the Bank would attach the greatest weight to any commentwhich the Tribunal might make on this point, buf I do feel that it might be useful if I were to paint the picture now as I see it. From time to time some strain is puton Directors by their possession of special knowledge, but it is very clearly under-stood by Directors that they must not allow special knowledge derived from theBank to influence them in their affairs elsewhere, but must seek to divorcethemselves from that knowledge and act as they would have done if theyhad no such knowledge. I thought that the Chairman put this positionvery clearly when questioning Mr. Keswick. A director clearly also has to be careful not to give any hint outside the Bank about special knowledge either in what he says or in such ways as abstaining from decisions.It seems to me that a similar position often arises both in business matters and, more generally, in other walks of life, where an honest man must often divorceone set of interests from another and must not use in one capacity information available to him in another. The position arises almost every day in banking,where a banker is not expected to use, for his bank&apos;s profit, secret information about a customer^ affairs. A professional accountant is not free to use secret information about the affairs of his clients for the benefit of a company of whichhe may be a director. I am not familiar with the legal profession but I imagine that the same position must arise there too.It is obvious that, in a case such as is before the Tribunal, this problem is so high-lighted. But I should not wish the Tribunal to feel that it is a problem which gives serious or frequent trouble in the Bank of England. In my 20 years&apos;experience on the Court I have found that in practice it does not give my colleaguesfrequent difficulty. On the rare occasions when a Director is uncertain about hisproper course, my experience is that he immediately comes to the Governor orDeputy Governor and asks what he should do.Nor should I wish the Tribunal to feel that this is a new problem. It musthave been with the Bank of England throughout its long history. In fact in theold days, when most Directors were individual merchants or partners in merchantfirms, it must have arisen much more frequently than it does now. Nor indeedis this problem confined to this country. In the other great financial market of theworld, the United States of America, the same sort of problem exists. Theresponsibility for fixing the rate of discount lies, subject to approval by the Boardof Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, with the Boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks in each district. These Boards of Directorsinclude representatives of commercial and banking interests, and conduct their affairs on rather similar lines to the Court of the Bank of England.But the existence of this problem (even if it arises infrequently) must pose thequestion whether the present arrangement is on balance best suited to the national interest.  I am most strongly of opinion that it is.The Bank of England is not, as is sometimes suggested, a mere operatingdepartment under the Treasury. This suggestion has been fed over recent yearsby quotation of a reference by a very great Chancellor of the Exchequer to theBank as &quot; his creature,&quot; a phrase which the Chancellor told me on the following day he had used lightly and in jest.The Bank of England is the banker, agent and confidential adviser toGovernment over a very wide range of financial matters, domestic and international.The Bank has also a direct responsibility for market monetary management,which includes the fixing of Bank Rate and various other market operations.This is the position both in Law and practice. In Law the Court is responsible forthe conduct of the Bank&apos;s affairs subject to any direction which may be given by her Majesty&apos;s Treasury under Section 4(1) of the Bank Act, 1946. In practice theCourt of the Bank accept and discharge these responsibilities, in consultation with
Her Majesty&apos;s Government and recognising that in the last resort the policy of theBank must conform with the general policy of Government. I am confident thatthis position is clearly understood between the Bank and Her Majesty&apos;s Treasury.The first responsibility for formulating the Bank&apos;s policy and for tenderingadvice to Her Majesty&apos;s Government naturally falls on myself and the deputy governor. We have at our disposal advice on policy and operational matters fromthe Executive Directors and the Permanent Staff of the Bank, most of whom have spent much or all of their working lives within the Bank. But it has beenconsistent practice throughout my experience for the Governor and deputy governor to keep the Court as a whole, and Directors individually, closely informed about policy and to consult with them and seek their views before making any major proposal. The Directors of the Bank cover between them a very wide range of interests in banking, industry, commerce, Trade Unions, shipping and insurance.They are all practical men, with a wide and up-to-date knowledge of events athome and abroad. It is quite invaluable to the Governors to be able to draw onthis fund of knowledge and experience in formulating policy and to be able to share with the Court responsibility for decisions which must affect sterlingthroughout the world. I believe that, at any rate in my experience of 20 years onthe Court, successive Chancellors of the Exchequer have felt it an advantage tothem, and to the national interest, to know that advice tendered to them by the governors and decisions proposed by the Governors have the support of the wide experience represented by the Court of Directors.The strength and the independence of thought of the Bank derive mainly froma Court constituted on present lines, taking an active and continuous part in formingpolicy. If the nature of the Court were to be altered so that it were not to be composed of active practical men of business, or if Directors were to become merefigureheads divorced from the real affairs of the Bank, then it is my belief that theutility of the Bank to the public interest, in this country and in the Commonwealth,would disappear.
