THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT&apos;)r&quot;Kjjf&quot;- &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;       --------C(53) 11 COPY NO. C_13th January, 1953CAD IITETNAT[QNA.L INSURANCE FUND DEFICIT, 1958/59Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer this deficit stood at  14 millions in the Estimates submitted tothe Treasury by the Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance.   TheMinistry have now revised their forecast of the deficit to  23 millions on new advice from the Ministry of Labour.2. Before we finally decide whether to meet the deficit from Votes,or by realising securities held in the Fund (i. e. by borrowing), I should like to put certain points before my colleagues.3.      If we meet the deficit by borrowing, we shall meet with two maincriticisms, to which we must have our answers ready:   first, that theprocess is inflationary, and second, that it is a raid on the contributors1own money, which is held in reserve for them against their own eventualbenefits.4.      I do not attach great importance to the second criticism, for ithas no foundation in reality.   Even if it had (and it may be inexpedient toexplain that the balances do not 2-eally belong to the contributors), itmight be possible to argue that in present conditions it is reasonable forthe contributors to avoid seeking relief from the taxpayer - through theuse of their reserves for the next two years or so and thereafter by paying the higher contributions which any new scheme must necessarily exactfrom contributors as a whole, though not from each of them individually.50      The first criticism, however, is one which I must naturally takevery seriously.   The effect of the operation is the same as that of taking any other block of expenditure in the Estimates and meeting it by borrowinginstead of from Votes.   We cannot afford to admit the charge that it isinflationary, nor, of course, would I in fact want to carry out the operation in an inflationary way.   I would therefore have to levy the same amountof taxation as I would have had to do in order to meet the charge fromVotes.   I would have to explain that because I was doing this the processwas not inflationary.   The Opposition would of course retort that in that case I was merely using  23 millions of taxation to offset  23 millions ofexpenditure financed by borrowing - an operation whose only conceivablepurpose would be to reduce artificially the total Parliamentary estimates and evade Parliamentary control over the expenditure.   It would not even
(as would an increase in the &quot;stamp&quot;) have the effect of relieving the taxpayer, (This *loes not mean that it can never be right to run downthese balances.   Their proper use is to meet deficiencies resulting from,e. g. , a prolonged slump in employment, when the Governmenfs task would be to combat deflation.)6.      In the light of this, how should we see the pros and cons of theoperation, if we eschew for the moment any idea of using it purely forpurposes of improving Estimate presentation?   Let me say at once thatI entirely recognise that those of my colleagues who have favoured thealternative of borrowing have been seeking to find a way of relieving theExchequer of considerable burdens, not only in the coming year but in theyear or two after that. But if, by relief to the Exchequer, we mean relief to xhe taxpayer and to the problems of taxation facing the Chancellor inthose years, I am afraid that the advantage may turn out to be illusory,because I cannot in fact relieve the taxpayer to the extent of the suggestedborrowing without increasing inflation.   In other words, the operation would be beneficial only when inflationary tendencies disappear. For thisreason, I do not by any means rule out the idea for 1959/60 or some lateryear, when we may hope that our anti-inflationary struggle has had some success.   But I think my colleagues may like to consider again whether we could really afford, in the coming year, the charge that we v/ere eitherbeing inflationary or (if not) merely doing a wangle.7.      Another thought which troubles me is that it has hitherto beenuniversally contemplated that this deficit would be met from Votes.We oui-selves took power to do so in the National Insurance Act, 1954,and on the Second Reading of last year&apos;s Bill (13th November, 1957)the Ministers in charge went out of their way to emphasise - and they had full Cabinet authority for this - that next year&apos;s deficit would be borneby the Exchequer.   So if we decide to meet it by borrowing instead, weshall, I feel, be expected to show some solid and convincing reason forthe change which did not apply two months ago.   I confess that I am netauite confident at present that we can produce such a reason - apart ofcourse from our present troubles over the &quot;Gap&quot;.D0K.A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.18th January, 1953
