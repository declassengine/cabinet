secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1958C (58) 48 Copy No.25th February, 1958CABINETNUCLEAR POWER :  I.B.R.D. LOANMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 31st October, 1957, my predecessor as Chancellor of the Exchequer was invited to examine the possibility of revising, on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister, the terms on which a loan might be obtained from the International bank for Reconstruction and Development (I.B.R.D.) for the United Kingdom nuclear power programme (C.C. (57) 77th Conclusions, Minute 5).2. With the agreement of the Minister of Power, exploratory discussions havenow been held between officials and representatives of the I.B.R.D. An agreedreport by officials on these discussions is annexed.3. It will be seen that the nature of the proposed loan would correspondclosely with the concept outlined by the Prime Minister, and that officials have found in the arrangements no particular feature which by itself constitutes a majorobstacle to the taking of a loan. While I fully appreciate that, taken together, allthe procedures involved present a certain amount of inconvenience, I am strongly of the opinion that this does not outweight the economic advantages which would accrue.4. As my predecessor pointed out in C. (57) 253 this I.B.R.D. lending inconjunction with the New York market represents the only real chance we have of getting any new direct fortifications for the reserves. Since then the indicationshave become all the stronger that we are in no position to forgo this addition toour resources. Although the immediate prospects for the balance of trade of theUnited Kingdom itself are good, partly because of the fall in commodity prices,nevertheless, for that same reason, which stems from the recession in the UnitedStates, the prospects for the rest of the sterling area are serious. The net result islikely to be a loss to our gold and dollar reserves before the end of the year. Wecannot afford to dispense with any potential source of gold and dollars which maystrengthen the United Kingdom and the sterling area in weathering the effect on world trade of the United States recession, and if this round went smoothly thereis a good prospect that we should be able to raise further sums in the same way.5. It is quite certain that we cannot hope to effect any change in the majorfeatures of the proposed arrangements by further exploratory discussions, and it isonly reasonable to expect that we may lose the opportunity once and for all unless we now open firm negotiations.6. The loan from the I.B.R.D. would have to be applied specifically to the nuclear power programme. This means in my view that it must be a loan from theI.B.R.D. direct to the nationalised industry, since I regard as overwhelming theobjections to borrowing by the Treasury earmarked for specific purposes. Asregards the market loan, if our expectation that this can be a general-purpose loanis fulfilled, the same objection to Treasury borrowing does not arise. But there arealso over-riding reasons of Budget policy for deciding that the industry shouldborrow direct from I.B.R.D. and indeed from the New York market as well if thatis technically possible.53065b
7. The industry are due to raise some  140 millions of capital next year.Under present arrangements this sum will be provided by capital advances from theExchequer below the line. The more the industry borrow direct from I.B.R.D. andthe New York market, the less will be the amount that has to be issued to them from the Exchequer and the better will be my prospects of reducing the overallBudgetary deficit in the next year or so. This is not just a presentational Budgetadvantage, though the presentation of the Budget has its importance, and the nearerwe can get to an overall balance the better will be the effect created abroad. the borrowing in the United States will be a genuine gain to the economy, since to that extent public investment here will be financed without calling on domesticresources, and it is fully justifiable to reflect that gain in the Budget accounts.8. I therefore recommend that authority be given for the opening of firmnegotiations without delay with the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment, with a view to obtaining a loan of $50 millions to the nationalisedelectricity supply industry towards their nuclear power programme. I alsorecommend that in conjunction with this negotiations should be opened for afurther loan of $50 millions from the New York market. In this case too the borrower should preferably be the nationalised industry. But if, on technical grounds, this course is not feasible, the loan should be a general purpose loan toHer Majesty&apos;s Government.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,21st February, 1958.
ANNEXNUCLEAR POWER: J.B.R.D. LOANReport by OfficialsSummaryUnited Kingdom officials have had detailed talks with representatives of theInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development (I.B.R.D.) about whatwould be involved in a loan from the Bank (in conjunction with a loan from theNew York market) for the United Kingdom nuclear power programme. TheAppendix to this report sets out the position on various aspects of the matter which do not call for detailed decisions by Ministers. The report itself summarisesbelow the background to the discussions, and sets out the principal considerations affecting the three main issues for decision by Ministers, which are as follows:  (a) Whether the United Kingdom should now proceed with a view to a loan from the I.B.R.D. in conjunction with a loan from the New Yorkmarket.(b) Whether the loan from the I.B.R.D. should be taken by the nationalisedelectricity industry direct, or whether it should be taken by theGovernment for lending to the industry.(c) Whether the loan from the New York market should be raised by theindustry or by the Government.Previous Developments2. On 31st October, 1957, the Cabinet invited the Chancellor of theExchequer to explore further the terms and conditions on which a loan mightbe obtained from the I.B.R.D. for the United Kingdom nuclear power programme.During the following week both the then Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Power met the President of the I.B.R.D., and these meetings served to confirm the following points:  (a) The I.B.R.D. could not make a dollar loan to finance expenditure in theUnited Kingdom except in conjunction with a loan raised on the new york market, which would render the I.B.R.D.&apos;s own loan justifiableas a gap-bridging operation.(b) The probable  amounts were  $50 millions  from  the  I.B.R.D.  and$50 millions from the market, though the I.B.R.D. would step up theamount when the time came if that proved possible.(c) We could take it that these might be the first of a series of loans from theI.B.R.D. (and the New York market) over the next few years.(d) Neither the I.B.R.D. nor the market loan would involve any equity holding;both would be bond issues. Neither would require anything in thenature of a mortgage, on the assets of the industry.3. The then Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Power thenagreed to a suggestion by the President of the I.B.R.D. that representatives of theBank might visit the United Kingdom to discuss with interested authorities herewhat would be involved in an I.B.R.D. and a market loan, without prejudice tothe decision whether Her Majesty&apos;s Government would wish to go ahead withsuch an arrangement. A decision would have to be taken by Ministers in thelight of the outcome of the discussions. This visit was to take place, and has infact taken place, without any publicity or any disclosure that discussions were proceeding. The I.B.R.D. sent a team of four, led by Mr. Davidson Sommers,one of their Vice-Presidents who is also the Bank&apos;s General Counsel, and includingthe Bank&apos;s Atomic Energy Adviser. During the week commencing 9th December,1957, the I.B.R.D. representatives had a series of meetings with representatives ofthe Treasury, the Ministry of Power, the Electricity Council and the central electricity Generating Board.  Other Departments have been kept informed.53065
I.B.R.D. Procedures4. There are various requirements and procedures which have to be satisfiedbefore the I.B.R.D. makes a loan to any country or organisation. These are dealtwith in some detail in the Appendix. On none of the points dealt with in theAppendix, taken individually, have difficulties been encountered so far which appear to constitute a major obstacle to arrangements for a loan.5. There is a further point, not arising so directly from the discussions withthe I.B.R.D. to which it is desirable to draw the attention of Ministers. This is the likelihood that at a later stage in their enquiries the I.B.R.D. would become seizedof the degree of economic risk involved in - the United Kingdom&apos;s nuclearprogramme. It is public knowledge that on present forecasts power from theUnited Kingdom nuclear stations is expected to be 10 per cent, dearer than power from conventional stations in the United Kingdom. This assumes no increase inthe cost of coal and oil for conventional stations; a 5 per cent, rate of interest on capital for the nuclear stations; and a given net price for the Generating Board&apos;snuclear fuel after allowing for repurchase of irradiated material by the atomic energy Authority. What has not hitherto been known is that this estimate alsoassumes that, as a result of technical progress postulated between now and, say,1960, a certain &quot; burn-up &quot; of fuel elements will be achieved although so far therehas been no practical experience to demonstrate this as attainable.6. It is suggested that this uncertainty about the fuel element performanceneed not by itself be regarded as an insuperable obstacle in the way of an applicationfor a loan. As the inherent risk in the nuclear power programme does notinvalidate the programme itself it need not invalidate the case for seeking a loan.If Ministers were to decide to seek a loan it could be put to the I.B.R.D. that we didnot claim to be able to show that each item in our electricity development programme would in the short run yield a profit by the test of commercialaccountancy. Taking all items together the manpower situation for coal mining,the insecurity of our oil supplies and the prospect of further scientific development in the field of nuclear energy we regarded our nuclear power programme asjustified on broad grounds. From the purely financial angle I.B.R.D. would have their guarantee from Her Majesty&apos;s Government whether the nuclear power stationsmake a profit or not.I.B.R.D. Loan Who should be the Borrower?7. The Electricity Council and the Generating Board would prefer that anyloan should be through the medium of the Treasury. This would avoid furthercomplications in general procedure for financing the industry, and would relieve theindustry of any exchange risk. The Treasury, however, consider that there are over-riding objections to any departure from the principle that the Exchequer doesnot borrow for specific purposes. This principle has so far been rigorously observed in spite of pressure. The I.B.R.D. would be prepared to make the loan either tothe industry (with a Government guarantee) or to the Government itself, but inthe latter case the loan proceeds would definitely have to be allocated for finance of the nuclear power programme, and thus would be an earmarked loan fora specific purpose. Even if the Treasury were to take the loan for lending to theindustry this would not dispose of the question of legislation, which would be needed, whether to provide for a lending operation of this kind, or for directborrowing from the I.B.R.D. by the industry. The Treasury therefore consider thatthe loan from the I.B.R.D. should be taken by the industry whether by theElectricity Council or by the Generating Board would have to be further considered.Market Loan Who should be the Borrower?8. The Electricity Council and the Generating Board would also prefer thatthe loan from the New York market should be raised by the Government, and here there are not the same objections from the Treasury&apos;s point of view. It isunderstood that this could be a general-purpose loan, not specifically related to finance for the nuclear power programme, although the prospectus for the marketloan would mention that it was being raised in conjunction with the I.B.R.D. loan for the programme. In that case, no fresh legislation would be required to enablethe Government to raise the market loan, whereas additional powers would be needed to enable the Electricity Council or the Generating Board to borrow by an issue of bonds in the New York market.   Moreover, the I.B.R.D. advise that
a New York loan to the industry (with a Government guarantee) would have some market disadvantages as compared with borrowing on the market by her Majesty&apos;s Government.Other Points9. The following two further points, which are dealt with in more detail in the Appendix, should be noted:  (a) It will be implicit in a decision to proceed with the I.B.R.D. loan projectthat, if the industry ever raises money in the United Kingdom on thestrength of a charge on its assets or revenues (which would probablybe a necessary feature of any borrowing by the industry without a treasury guarantee), the I.B.R.D. should, if necessary, at that stage begiven equivalent security (see paragraph 1 (g) of the Appendix).(/;) It would be the United Kingdom&apos;s intention that the I.B.R.D. loan shouldbe related to as limited a sector of the nuclear power programme aspossible, but it may well be necessary to relate it to at least two nuclear power stations rather than to a single station.10.  To sum up Ministers are invited to decide:  (a) Whether the United Kingdom should now proceed with a view to a loan from the I.B.R.D. in conjunction with a loan from the New Yorkmarket.(b) Whether the loan from the I.B.R.D. should be taken by the nationalisedelectricity industry direct, or whether it should be taken by theGovernment for lending to the industry.(c) Whether the loan from, the New York market should be raised by theindustry or by the Government.February 1958.AppendixCONDITIONS UNDER I.B.R.D.&apos;s PROCEDURESThe requirements and procedures on which the I.B.R.D. have to be satisfiedare partly a matter of their Articles and partly a matter of practice. Although inthe present case the I.B.R.D. are prepared to be accommodating in such matters as not requiring competitive tendering and in financing expenditure alreadyincurred, it is clear that they will be very reluctant to forgo any of these requirements or procedures as a concession to the United Kingdom, if to do so would make it difficult to demonstrate to other member countries that the UnitedKingdom was not being given favoured treatment. The principal steps involved are as follows:  (a) Report to the I.B.R.D. Board on the financial and economic position ofthe United Kingdom.This is not expected to present any problem. Such reports have beenprepared in the past in connection with United Kingdom guarantees of I.B.R.D. loans to Colonial territories. The last of these reports wasin connection with the Kariba loan in 1956. It will be a question of bringing this up-to-date.(b) Report on the general activities and financial position of the electricity industry.This is not expected to present any problem, so far as it deals with thepast and the present. In addition, the I.B.R.D. staff would wish to askquestions on and comment in their report about the probable futurefinancial policies and viability of the industry, so as to be in a positionto deal with any comments on this which may be made when thereport goes to the I.B.R.D. Board. The Electricity Council do notwelcome this prospect, though they do not suggest that this is a seriousobstacle to arrangements for a loan.(c) Technical report on the economics of the nuclear project or projects withwhich an I.B.R.D. loan would be associated.
This report would be based on documents of a confidential but, forthe most part, general character to be made available to the I.B.R.D.staff by the Generating Board. This would then be supplemented bydetailed enquiries into particular aspects. The United Kingdom wouldbe given an opportunity to comment on the report in draft before it was put to the I.B.R.D. Board. No information of military value would be supplied, and it is not considered that any leak of informationof commercial value would result. The Generating Board do notwelcome the obligation to deal with these enquiries or the calls whichwould be made on its time but the work would not be so heavy asto constitute a serious objection to arrangements for a loan.(d) I.B.R.D.&apos;s right of inspection during construction.The I.B.R.D. would expect to send representatives on visits of inspection, lasting one or two weeks each, once or twice a year, duringthe period of construction. They would also expect to receive progressreports, perhaps once every quarter. The Generating Board wouldbe prepared to accept such arrangements.(e) Procedure for reimbursement of expenditure.The I.B.R.D. would make disbursements against evidence that expenditure had been incurred. This would present no difficulty.(/) Guarantee Agreement.If a loan is made to Her Majesty&apos;s Government for lending to theindustry, there will be only a Loan Agreement If it is made direct tothe industry, the Loan Agreement would be supplemented by aGuarantee Agreement between the United Kingdom and the I.B.R.D.Either the Loan Agreement or the Guarantee Agreement, or both, would include undertakings to the effect that the project or projects will becarried to completion; this does not appear to present any difficulty.There would also be a &quot; negative pledge &quot; to the effect that, if any assets of the United Kingdom or of the industry are pledged as security toany other overseas lender, then the I.B.R.D. will at the same time begiven corresponding security. This is of definite significance only asit concerns Her Majesty&apos;s Government, who have already given the&quot; negative pledge&quot; as part of the United Kingdom guarantees forI.B.R.D. loans to Colonies; as a result, having now pledged dollarsecurities as collateral for an advance from the Export-Import Bank of washington, the United Kingdom has also been obliged to pledgesimilar collateral to the I.B.R.D. From this point of view, the effectof taking an I.B.R.D. loan for the nuclear power programme would not involve any further pledge of collateral to the I.B.R.D. in the firstinstance, but would result in the giving of such collateral if, for instance,there were to be a repeat of the Export-Import Bank Agreement in thefuture, and the amount which we could borrow on the strength of our dollar portfolio would be correspondingly reduced. However, this isa disadvantage which we must in any case expect to incur when wecome to guarantee further I.B.R.D. loans to the Colonies.(g) Finally, there would be an undertaking that, if the industry ever createsanything in the nature of a mortgage or debenture in favour of anyother lender, the I.B.R.D. would be given similar security. As distinct from the form of &quot; negative pledge &quot; just discussed (which is concerned only with overseas borrowing), this final undertaking might conceivably in some circumstances be brought into effect if the industry were to borrow on the United Kingdom market on the strength of a charge on the business. The nationalised electricity industry has neverso far given any such security which has been unnecessary while all its market borrowings have been guaranteed by the Treasury but theposition might be changed if it were decided that any future marketborrowings should not have the benefit of the Treasury guarante.Relationship of the Loan to the Nuclear programme . If Ministers decide to proceed with a view to an I.B.R.D. loan, a subsidiaryquestion which will have to be further explored is whether the loan should be related to the nuclear power programme as a whole or to one or more particular nuclearstations.   The Generating Board have expressed strong objections to associating
a loan with the whole programme, on the grounds that this would enlarge the scope for specific technical enquiries by the I.B.R.D., and would prefer any initial loan tobe related to one particular station, either trie Berkeley or the Bradwell project.The Generating Board would, however, accept that it necessary any initial loanshould be applied to both these stations, and would be ready to consider the selection of further particular stations in the event of subsequent loans. The I.B.R.D.&apos;sown attitude on this remains to be further clarified. The indications are that agreement with them would be possible on the basis of a loan which, within the nuclear programme, would be directed towards the finance of the Bradwell andBerkeley projects. The Treasury&apos;s concern in this respect is that the sector ofthe programme chosen should be large enough to justify receipt of the whole$50 millions from the I.B.R.D. by, say, 1st January, 1959. Though selection of asingle station might achieve this result if the I.B.R.D. were prepared to relatedisbursements to expenditure on a   for   basis, it would be necessary to embraceboth Bradwell and Berkeley to achieve the same rate of disbursements if the latter were on, say, a basis of 10s. for every  1 spent, as they might well be. Theinclusion of a third and fourth station would not make a very material difference to the rate of receipt, since progress on other stations will not be so early as onthese two.Market Issue Procedures and Terms3. Whether the bond issue in the New York Market were affected by her majesty&apos;s Government or by the industry, it need not be specifically related to the nuclear programme, and would not involve supplying confidential information onthat subject. But it would require a very full prospectus, much bulkier and more detailed than a prospectus issued in the United Kingdom, giving all relevant information about the economic and financial position of the United Kingdom(whether as borrower or guarantor) and of the industry also, if the industry werethe borrower. Representatives of the United States Issuing House will have to visit the United Kingdom at an early stage to put preparation of this in hand.These requirements would not arise if the Market loan were to take the form ofa private placing with financial institutions, but Mr. Sommers of the I.B.R.D.has expressed doubts about the prospects for such an operation, and certainlyadvises that it would have definite disadvantages from the point of view of securing a broad market, and, still more, from the point of view of establishing a market which could be tapped by the United Kingom in future years. Although theexpenses of a private placing would be somewhat smaller, the amount which couldbe raised would be less and the rate of interest would be higher. The indications,are therefore, that the Market loan would be by means of a public offer. Theexpenses of the issue would be met by the spread between the price paid by theUnited States public and the price received by the United Kingdom.4. As regards the yield to be offered to the public, this might have to be slightly higher if the issue were made by the industry with a guarantee, instead of by Her Majesty&apos;s Government. Moreover, Mr. Sommers had advised that a guaranteed issue would be less advantageous from the point of view of establishing the credit of the United Kingdom Government itself with a view to subsequentborrowing in the New York Market.
