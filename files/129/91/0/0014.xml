CABINETGRANT TO THE ARTS council memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer should be glad to have the views of my colleagues on theproblems with which I am faced regarding the grant to the Arts council for 1958/59.   The amounts involved are relatively small, but there maybe considerable public comment on my decision.2.        The Arts Council help a v/ide range of cultural activities,including the Covent Garden Opera Company, Sadler&apos;s Wells, the Old Vic,seven symphony orchestras, repertory theatres, musical festivals andso forth.    The Exchequer grant which they distribute among these bodieshas risen from  235,000 in 1945/46 to  675,000 in 1952/53 and 9S5.000 in 1957/58.3.        The then Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr. Macmillan),when informing the Council of the last-mentioned amount in December, 1956told them that he saw small prospect over the next two or three years ofan increase in the amount of grant given for the Council&apos;s presentactivities, and he expressed the hope that the Council would bear in mind that there was little hope of any expansion being possible in that period.4.        Towards the end of last year, the Council informed my predecessor that they estimated that they would require  1,23S,600 in1958/59, i. e. , more than  250,000 above the figure for 1957/58.    they said that this increase was mainly due to wage increases and rising costs among the bodies which they assisted, to the absence   of an american tour for the Royal Ballet, and to the need to carry out acertain amount of work that had been deferred from previous years.5.        My predecessor informed Sir Kenneth Clark, the Chairman ofthe Arts Council, that he saw little hope of being able to give more than 1 million in 1958/59, but said that he would take a final decision in thecourse of this month.6.        I ought perhaps to explain at this point that formally theTreasury do no more than indicate to the Arts Council the amount of theExchequer grant which they can expect.    It is for the Arts Council todecide how that money should be spent.    But, of course, the Arts Councilinform the Treasury how they have built up their estimate and whatwould be involved if they did not receive the amount for which they ask.The Government tends to be saddled with responsibility for theconsequences of any cuts.7. The Council have said that, as an emergency operation, theactivities which they at present support could continue on a grant of 1,100,000 in 1958/59. It is clear, however, that this would involvea substantial increase in grant in 1959/60.-1-C.(58) 1421st January, 1958(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.&quot;)Q
8.        The Council have also indicated that, if a grant of less than 1,100,000 were given to them, they would have to terminate their support to Sadler&apos;s Wells.   This would yield a saving of  50,000 in1958/59 and a further  90,000 in a full year.    If further savings had tobe effected, the Arts Council would probably withdraw their support from two or three symphony orchestras.and, unless these orchestras were able to secure more assistance   locally, they would have to be disbanded.9.        An increasing proportion of the and Council grant is now goingto opera and ballet and is supporting   Covent Garden, Sadler&apos;s Wells,Carl Rosa and, to some extent, the Welsh National Opera Company.Under the original proposals for 1958/59, more than 50 per cent of theexpenditure of Sadler&apos;s Wells and Carl Rosa was to be met by the arts Council.    This is a disquieting development, since it greatlylessens the incentives within these bodies for economical administration.The proportion of the Arts Council grant going to opera and ballet wouldbe nearly 60 per cent.   The withdrawal of support from Sadler &apos;s Wellswould help to correct this undue emphasis on assistance to opera andballet and, as indicated above, would give a substantial easement tothe Arts Council in later years.10.        There are three courses open to me.    I can -(a) give a grant of  1 million, as offered by my predecessor,in the knowledge that this will involve the closing down of Sadler&apos;s Wells, and probably the disbandment of anumber of symphony orchestras;(b) give a grant of  1,050,000 (or possibly rather less on thebasis of  50,000 above this year&apos;s figure), which wouldprobably involve no more than the closing of Sadler&apos;s Wells;(c) give a grant of  1,100,000 to enable present activities to continue at spartan level, in the knowledge thatcontinuance of these activities in 1959/60 would almost certainly involve a substantial increase in grant.11.      My conclusion is that I ought not in existing circumstanceato give a grant of more than  1 million.D.H.A,Treasury Chambers, S.W.I.21st January, 1958-2-
