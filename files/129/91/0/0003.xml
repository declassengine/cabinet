We are all of us agreed that either of these courses would be quite unacceptable and would gravelyimperil the prospects of stimulating recruitment, upon which the ending of National Service depends.3* We have, however, with considerable difficulty found it possible to accept a number of other cuts in the defence estimates,amounting in all to about  18 millions, made up as follows -  millionsAdmiraltyWar office air ministry ministry of SupplyR,  &amp; D.Nuclear Test3-133(plus  51 millionsoff the civil estimates)184, As a result of these cuts, the defence estimates as a whole will be red iced to  1,474 millions.
