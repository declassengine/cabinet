ANNEXBRITISH EUROPEAN AIRWAYSExtract from a letter from the Attorney-general to the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation11th February, 1958X        K       X       XThe relevant statutory powers of the Minister of transport are contained in Sections 3(5) and 5 of the Air Corporation Act, 1949.Under Section 5 the Minister may, after consultation with B.E.A.,give B.E.A. directions of a general character as to the exercise and performance by that corporation of their functions in relation to matters appearing to the Minister to affect the national interest, andthe corporation is under a statutory duty to give such effect to such directions.2.     As I am wholly ignorant of the circumstances which led you to write to me, I cannot express any opinion on whether you could lawfullygive a direction under Section 5.3.      The matters in relation to which you give a direction mustappear to you matters which affect the national interest.   If it were established that there were no grounds upon which you could properlycome to that conclusion, your direction if challenged in the courts wouldbe held invalid.4.     The directions must be of a general character, i. e. you couldnot lawfully direct B.E.A. not to place a particular order, or to buy only from named manufacturers, but you could if it appeared to you in thenational interest and there were grounds for that conclusion, give a direction that B.E.A. were only to buy aeroplanes made in the UnitedKingdom.5.      If you give a direction under Section 5 and it is a valid one, theB.E.A, must comply with it.   The duty imposed on them by Section 3(1)does not give them any ground for not doing so.6.     I am sorry not to be able to be more helpful about this, but itis really not possible without knowledge of the circumstances.7.     Section 3(5) enables you to limit the powers of the corporation to such extent as you think desirable in the public interest by providing that any power of the corporation specified in the order is not to be exercisable except in accordance with a general or special authority given by you.8.      Consequently, if you thought it desirable in the public interest,you could make an order that B.E.A. should not buy any aeroplanes exceptin accordance with a general or special authority given by you.   you could thus, by only giving authority for specific purchases, control theorders for aeroplanes placed by B.E.A.
9.      An order under this provision is made by statutory instrumentwhich is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either house.10.     With regard to the powers of B.E.A. to borrow money.Section 8(1) requires the consent of the Treasury to borrow temporarilyby way of overdraft or otherwise.   The consent of the Treasury is also required for the borrowing of money.by the issue of stock for theprovision of working capital, and for the other purposes mentioned inSection 8.11.     If the consent of the Treasury is not forthcoming, the moneycannot lawfully be borrowed.   I see nothing in the Act to fetter theexercise by the Treasury of their discretion to grant or withhold consent,and there is no limitation as to the matters to which they can haveregard in determining whether or not to give their consent.12.     A Minister is certainly not compelled to make an advance underSection 42 of the Finance Act, 1956.X       X       X       X(Signed)  REGINALD MANNINGHAM-BULLERThe Rt. Hon. Harold Watkinson, M.P.
