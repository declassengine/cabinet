[13 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAKEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(58) 713th January, 1958 COPY NO.cabinet national HEALTH SERVICE CONTRIBUTIONMemorandum by the Minister of Pensions and national insurance would like to invite my colleagues attention to certain respects in which the proposal to increase the National Health Serviceelement in joint National Insurance/National Health Service contributions would, it appears to me, in particular as a result of my experience on theNational Insurance Bill,be open to criticism, so that these may be weighedbefore a final decision is taken.2.        The proposal to increase the contribution to the National health service levied on the joint National Insurance/National I-lealth service contribution or &quot;stamp&quot; is not of course an economy or a reduction inGovernment expenditure.   It is an increase in taxation.   The method usedis that of a hypothecated regressive poll tax.3.        The impact of this impost is directed neither by considerations of ability tf* pay ncr by the degree of use made of the National health service.   It is quite arbitrarily attached to liability to contribute to national insurance.   It falls upon some millions of people who, by reasonof their small means or family responsibilities, are deliberatelyexempted from income tax.   Its arbitrariness is further illustrated bythe fact that it falls on these married women in employment who opt in to national insurance but net on those who opt out.   It falls also on the S3lf-emplcyed and non-emplcyed contributor to national insurance, many ofwhom are people of very limited means.4.       A decision as to whether an increase in the joint contribution isat present wise may be affected by the reflection that such an increase would be the third within a year and that an increase of 10d. in respectof employed persons would involve a trebling of the Health Serviceelement of the contribution within the same period.   The Health contributionwas raised (by lOd. in all divided as to 2d. and 8d. between employer andemployed, a.nd by 10d. in respect of self-employed and non-employed) atthe beginning of September 1957,   That increase v/as defended on thegrounds that it restored the relative size of the contribution to thatcontemplated in 1946.   The increases in the National Insurance contribu-tion provided for by the National Insurance (No. 2) Act, 1957 are not yet in force.   These increases (3s. lid, in all in respect of employed persons and 2s. 3d. for the self-employed) will operate in the week beginning 2nd February.   They will,, therefore, actually be felt by wayof deduction from the pay packet at the end of that week.   They will be at
the rate of 17s. 6d. (3s. Id. employer, 9s. 5d. employee) for employedmen, 11s. 6d. for self-employed, 9s- Id. for non-employed.   The Cabinetv/Sll recall that when they considered these proposals on 2nd August(C.C.(57) 61st Conclusions, Minute 4) they came to the conclusionthat, notwithstanding the emerging deficit on the National Insurance Fund,these represented the highest acceptable level of contributions.   The wisdom of this decision was confirmed by the severe criticism during debates on the Bill of the high level of the proposed contribution, and theirimpact on the poorer section of the community.5.         In the light of the above it will inevitably be argued against us, either that we are incapable of planning more than a month or twoahead or tha\ knowing we were going to do this we were guitty of sharppractice in not revealing it at the time of the recent Bill.   In additionwe shall be faced with an announcement of an increase when the presentincreases have only just come into effect.6.        Apart, therefore, from the general difficulties of this proposal,the timing of an announcement has plainly difficulties of its own.3* .A..
