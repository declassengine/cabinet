SECRET r        ^0THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC SiAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1958C. (58) 50 Copy No. 5725th February, 1958CABINETNUCLEAR POV/ER: I.B.R.D. LOANMemorandum by the Minister of PowerIf the Chancellor of the Exchequer is of the opinion that, in order to augmentthe reserves and to reduce the overall deficit in the forthcoming Budget, we should seek to negotiate a loan from the International Bank for Research andDevelopment (I.B.R.D.) to the electricity authorities of 50 million dollars and an issue on the New York market of a further 50 million dollars, I would not maintainmy objection to this course.   .2. I consider, however, that in order to assist the consideration of this matterI should state my reasons for disliking the proposal:  (a) It will require legislation.(b) It will be most unpopular.  Our success in the civil use of nuclear power has been much publicised and the fact that we are now compelled to seek American aid for its prosecution will, I feel, be much criticised.(c) Mr. Black, the President of the Bank, has made it clear that the Bankcould not lend against electricity works as a whole but only againstthe nuclear power programme. I am suspicious of the motives.(d) There are still uncertainties attaching to a programme based on a scienceso new as atomic power. We cannot be sure that in the course of theirscrutiny of the programme the Bank, stimulated perhaps by hostileAmerican critics of our nuclear techniques, will not unearth some facts which tend to discredit it.(e) Information submitted to the I.B.R.D. Board is available to every member country which means all our potential customers. If the fearsexpressed in (d) above proved to be justified and an adverse reporton our nuclear programme were made to the Bank, our chances (whichare at present promising) of doing nuclear business in Italy, Japan andother countries would suffer a serious set-back.(/) There is no certainty that further loans beyond the present 100 million dollars will be forthcoming.(g) Any such loan is only a temporary addition to our reserves and will haveto be repaid in dollars with interest.3. In any case I consider that the electricity authorities should not be askedto borrow on&quot; the New York market. This, in my view, should be a Treasuryoperation for the following reasons:  (a) Borrowing by a nationalised industry will not, in my view, be distinguishablefrom borrowing by the Government, and camouflaged government borrowing might well invite criticism.(6) The International Bank Mission gave us to believe that a direct loan toHer Majesty&apos;s Government could be floated in New York at a lower rate of interest than a loan to the nationalised industry even if it carrieda Government guarantee.(c) The procedure would be more complicated if the industry were to be the borrower.  The electricity authorities would have to file with the New53068
Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1,24 th February, 1958.York Market authorities an elaborate dossier of information about their economic and financial prospects.(d) Her Majesty&apos;s Government already have the necessary statutory powers        i for a Wall Street loan. Borrowing by the industry in Wall Street would .)add to the new legislation to be presented to Parliament.(e) It would be hard to justify making the electricity authorities carry theexchange risk implicit in a dollar loan of this kind, considering thatthey have no need of dollars for their programme and no means of earning dollars with which to service the loan.M.
