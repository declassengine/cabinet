C.(58) 2227th January, 1958CABINETIMPERIAL INSTITUTE;  COLCUTT TOWERMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer was invited by the Cabinet to report further on the possibilityof securing a substantial economy in respect of the Colcutt tower(C.C.(58) 8th Conclusions, Minute 3) .   It was originally proposed topull down the existing Imperial Institute building (including the tower),built by Colcutt, in order to make possible an adequate expansion of theImperial College of Science.   This is a large scheme, of the highest importance in the Governments plans for expanding facilities for scientific studies.COPY NO.2.      The proposal raised a great storm of protest, not only from theRoyal Fine Art Commission, but from architects generally, fromarchitectural writers like John Betjeman, from a number   of Membersof Parliament and others interested in amenities.   The London CountyCouncil were also dissatisfied with the plan on other grounds.   Afterlong and delicate negotiations, a compromise was produced whereby therest of the building would be pulled down and the tower preserved.   Thiscompromise was not approved by the Royal Fine Art Commission, butthey were prepared to acquiesce in it.    It was endorsed by the Cabinet(CM.(56) 45th Conclusions, Minute 3) and announced in Parliament on21st June, 1956.   The announcement, and a reference to this matter by the Lord Privy Seal in Debate on the same day, are annexed.3.     It will be seen that the terms of this announcement virtuallycommit the Government, subject only to the obtaining of expert adviceas to the scheme&apos;s technical feasibility.   No reservation was made asto cost.   The technical reports have now been received, and they conclude that the plan is technically feasible.   The cost of the works necessaryto secure the stability of the tower as a free-standing campanile isestimated at  200,000.   Since it would cost about  40,000 to pull thetower down, the net additional expenditure is  160,000, but it would be prudent to assume that an unusual job of this kind is likely in the end to cost more than the original estimate.4.      Many people may thinkt   and I agree with them, that this is alarge sum to spend on such a purpose, and the present atmosphere iscertainly propitious for economy measures.   But there are arguments against a change of plan.(a)  The expenditure would not fall to be met until about 1960.It will not therefore affect next year!s Estimates.-1-(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT)
(b) If the tower is not to be retained, considerable revision ofthe building plans will be necessary, and there will be some undesirabledelay in the progress of an urgent expansion scheme.(c) There will certainly be considerable controversy, an occasion for which will arise on the Imperial Institute Bill now beforeParliament.   Lord Bridges has been informally consulted as Chairmanof the Royal Fine Art Commission, and he advises that a &quot;considerableexplosion&quot; is probable.(d) The Minister of Housing has been recommended by hisAdvisory Committee under Sir William Holford to include the imperial institute in a list of buildings meriting preservation because of their special architectural interest.   The Minister need not accept thisrecommendation;  but if the Government decided to pull down the towerthe Committee^ recommendation might easily become known.5.     My own conclusion is that on the whole we had probably betterlet the existing plan remain unchanged.   Rightly or wrongly, theGovernment are pretty deeply committed to this scheme.   Amenityinterests are notoriously vocal, and command considerable Parliamentasupport.   Here, to the charge of vandalism they would no doubt adda charge of breach of faith.   I doubt whether the resulting row would be worth while.D.H.A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.27th January, 19582-
ANNEXIMPERIAL COLLEGEExtracts from House of CommonsOfficial Re-port of 21st June. 1956I.    Cols.  125 - 125SIR P. SPENS asked the Secretary to the Treasury whether he is yet in a position to give any further information aboutthe plans for the development of Imperial College.MR. H. BROOKE:   Yes.     When I last informed the Houseof the position, the plans prepared by the Imperial Collegefor the development of the rectangle between Prince ConsortRoad and Imperial Institute Road had just been formallysubmitted by the College to the London County Council asplanning authority.     The Council gave its outline approval to the plans for the east and west blocks of the proposedbuildings, and work can now proceed on these with the con-currence of the Royal Pine Art Commission.As regards the central part of the scheme, I understandthat, quite apart from the wish of the Royal Pine art commission to preserve the Collcutt Building,  the Councilregarded the plans submitted by the College as somewhat over-building the site, and thought that a reduction in densitymight also enable the retention of at least the tower to beconsidered.     The situation will, however, be eased as aresult of the acquisition by the College of all the north,east and south sides of Princes Gardens, lying immediately to the east of the rectangle.      Of this area, the east side and most of the south side are available for immediatedevelopment.     These sites in Princes Gardens are reservedfor residential development, and are being acquired primarily to enable the College to provide much needed residence forsome of its students.     They are not, therefore, in any sensea substitute for the rectangle.     But the plans prepared bythe College for the development of the rectangle providedthere for certain facilities (common rooms and refectories)which the planning authority would be prepared to accept onthe new sites.     This will make it possible to transfer a portion of these facilities to Princes Gardens, and thus toreduce the density of the development of the rectangular site.The College has also considered with great care, inconsultation with the L.C.C. and the Royal Pine art commission, whether, in the light of this ruling it would bepossible to meet the Commission^ wishes in regard to theCollcutt Building.     The conclusion is that it is still notpossible to meet its wishes in full without reducing the scale of the expansion at the Imperial College on which the Governmenthave decided, and to which they attach great importance;   but a revised plan has been prepared which not only gives a lowerdensity of development, but would also enable the central towerof the Collcutt Building to be preserved by the College as a free standing campanile.     Before a definite decision can be-3-
taken it will be necessary for expert advice to be obtained on the stability of the tower as a separate unit.     The RoyalPine Art Commission has given its views on this proposal ina letter the text of which is as follows:&quot;Sir,I am directed by the Royal Fine Art Commission to refer to the meeting on 23rd March with the Financial Secretary and representatives of the University Grants Committee, LondonUniversity and the Imperial College of Science and Technology,at which the proposed expansion of the College at SouthKensington was further considered in the light of suggestions made by the London County Council.     The whole position wasreviewed by the Commission on the 11th April, when it wasagreed that a start should be made on the new buildings facingExhibition Road and Queen&apos;s Gate while the future of the restof the site was further discussed.     Representatives of theCommission subsequently met the Rector and his architect,and a revised scheme for the central area was seen by theCommission on 9th May.This latest scheme retains the tower of the imperial institute, leaving an open, space between it and the RoyalCollege of Music, the new buildings being reduced in volume,limited to a height of about l6o feet maximum and re-arrangeda sy mme t r i c a 1 ly.The Commission welcomes the initiative taken by theCounty Council in this matter, and appreciates the effortsthat have been made by the College authorities and theirarchitect to meet the criticisms of the earlier scheme.      Itis now more than ever convinced, however, that much of thedifficulty has arisen from the original requirement to construct a larger volume of building on this site than is suitable eitherto this part of London or to the collegiate character of theinstitution.     It considers that this will become increasinglyapparent at the time when demands for the expansion of particulardepartments have to be met.The Commission cannot approve any development which involves the demolition of the main Collcutt building in viewof its architectural value and historical importance.     Butthe decision to do this has been taken, and in these circum-stances the Commission prefers the latest scheme which retainsthe tower to the original scheme which involved a total des-truction of the building.     The Commission agrees with theCellege authorities that the latest revised design provides the best basis so far suggested for a scheme on these lines.There are a number of points that will require furtherconsideration, including the treatment of the base of the tower,both structurally and aesthetically, if the rest of thebuilding is removed.     The Commission would welcome oppor-tunities to consider these and other details as the schemedevelops.Copies of this letter have been sent to the College, theUniversity, the University Grants Committee and the LondonCounty Council.I am, Sir,Your obedient Servant,(Sgd.)    GODFREY SAMUEL&quot;
II.    Col.  1762Now I come to the controversial question of the tower.The College authorities have considered with great care, andin consultation with the London County Council and the RoyalFine Art Commission, whether, in the light of this develop-ment it would be possible to meet the wishes of the Commissionin regard to the Collcutt Building.     The conclusion is thatit is still not possible to meet its wishes in full withoutreducing the scale of the expansion of the Imperial Collegeon which the Government have decided and to which we attachfirst-class importance as being our major technologicalbuilding at the present time.I am glad to say, however, that a revised plan has beenprepared, which not only gives a lower density of development,but v/ill also enable the central tower of the Collcutt building to be preserved by the College as a free-standing campanile.Before a decision on the tower can be taken, it will be necessaryfor expert advice to be obtained on the stability of the tov/eras a separate unit.     A Written Answer, with the views of theRoyal Fine Art Commission on this matter, will be printed inthe OFFICIAL REPORT to-morrow morning.-5-
