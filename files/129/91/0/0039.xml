Never in peacetime has lite British sailor, soldier and airmanhad a more vitally important part to play.   Never has hemore deserved the respect and appreciation of those who livetheir daily lives under the cover of his protection.Britain&apos;s Contribution to PeaceBalance ok&apos; Amis1.   The world to-day is poised between the hope of total peace and the fear of total war.2. The Western Nations and the Soviet Union face one another withdeep-seated mutual distrust. Each fears that the other has aggressiveintentions; and no amount of pacific assurances in both directions have sofar succeeded in removing these suspicions. Against this sombre background,the peace of the world is being uneasily maintained by a precarious balanceof arms, in part conventional and in part nuclear.3. Russia&apos;s successful launching of artificial satellites is evidence ofher remarkable progress in rocket development. But it should not be thoughtthat this has upset the balance of military power.4.   In fact, the overall superiority of the West is likely to increase ratherthan diminish, as a consequence of the advent of medium-range ballisticrockets.  These weapons, against which there is at present no answer, could,from sites in Europe and elsewhere, dominate practically every target ofimportance in the Soviet Union.   The possession by Russia of rockets of equal range will not, for reasons of geography, afford her any correspondingstrategic advantage.  It would be of no use to her to attack Western Europe,unless she could simultaneously knock out the vital strategic air bases in theUnited States.  She could at present have no reasonable hope of achieving this with manned bombers, and it will still take her several years to complete the development of an accurate inter-continental rocket and produce it insufficient numbers.   By then, the United States, which has now also successfully launched an artificial satellite, will have inter-continental rocketsalso; and strategic rocket weapons of all ranges will, in due course, be maderelatively invulnerable by siting underground.   Meanwhile, both sides are proceeding with the development of submarines, capable of firing nuclearmissiles from under water.5. There is thus no military reason why a world conflagration shouldnot be prevented for another generation or more through the balancing fears of mutual annihilation. In fact, there is no reason why all this should not go on almost indefinitely. But that would indeed be a mournful prospect.To-day no country can hope to gain anything by war; and all would deriveincalculable benefit from the restoration of mutual confidence and real peace.6. There can, however, be no such confidence or peace, so long as the arms race continues.  Means must be found to halt and reverse this process:152892
7. It is not necessary to stress the practical difficulties of reaching agreement on disarmament and of enforcing the agreement, once made.The issue is further complicated by the possibility that additional nuclearpowers may emerge in a few years&apos; time. Nor is the problem confined to reaching agreement between Russia and the West. In the next decade, thevast potential resources of China will have to be reckoned with as an increasingly important element in the balance of power.8. The ultimate aim must be comprehensive disarmament by all nations,coupled with comprehensive inspection and control by a world authority.Nothing less than this makes sense. That may seem a long way off. But it is just as well to recognise it and proclaim it as the final objective.9. It would, of course, be too much to hope that this objective couldbe brought about all at one stroke. It will have to be pursued by stages.If the safety of humanity is not to be imperilled, great care must be takento maintain, at each successive stage, the balance of military power anddeterrents, which, for the present, constitute almost the sole safeguard ofpeace.10. In seeking a basis for agreement, account must be taken of theentirely different military positions of the two sides.11. Russia has been making great strides in the field of nuclear weapons and rockets. But her basic strength lies in iier overwhelming superiority inconventional armaments and military manpower. The Soviet Union and hersatellites have over 200 active divisions facing the West, about 20.000 aircraft,and a fleet which includes some 500 submarines.12. The West, on the other hand, relies for its defence primarily uponthe deterrent effect of its vast stockpile of nuclear weapons and its capacity to deliver them. The democratic Western nations will never start a war against Russia. But it must be well understood that, if Russia were to launch a major attack on them, even with conventional forces only, they would haveto hit back with strategic nuclear weapons. In fact, the strategy of N.A.T.O. isbased on the frank recognition that a full-scale Soviet attack could not berepelled without resort to a massive nuclear bombardment of the sources of power in Russia. In that event, the role of the allied defence forces in europe would be to hold the front for the time needed to allow the effects of the nuclear counter-offensive to make themselves felt.13. It is best that these stark facts should be stated plainly; since the one thing which might conceivably tempt the Soviet Union into military adventurewould be the erroneous belief that the West, if attacked, would flinch from using its nuclear power.Disarmament14. Against this background, it is easy to understand why the SovietGovernment constantly demands a total and immediate ban on nuclear weapons, without offering any equally far-reaching or rapid disarmament onthe conventional side. In taking this line, Russia also derives an immensepropaganda advantage, since she is able to exploit the natural revulsion withwhich normal people everywhere regard weapons of mass destruction.2
15. The Western nations, although they know that their entire safetyrests upon the possession of nuclear weapons, have never resisted the idea that these should be progressively reduced. But they obviously cannot agreeto this without fully compensating reductions in conventional forces.Otherwise Russia would be left in a position to dominate *he world.16. On the other hand, it must be recognised that, however carefully thebalance of armaments is held, or thought to be held, there always remains apossibility that some unforeseen circumstance or miscalculation might sparkoff a world-wide catastrophe. Since there are risks in leaving things as theyare, it is justifiable, within reasonable limits, to accept risks in trying tobring about agreement. In this spirit and with these considerations in mindBritain, Canada, France and the United States put forward, through theUnited Nations, a plan for partial disarmament which could immediately be put into effect, even in the absence of progress in the solution of major political problems. Their main proposals can be summarised as follows:  id) nuclear tests to be immediately suspended;(/;) production of fissile material for weapon purposes to be stopped assoon as an effective control system is operating;(c) existing military stocks of fissile material (including material already incompleted weapons) to be progressively transferred to civil purposes:id) a first stage in the reduction of conventional armaments and militarymanpower to be completed within one year;ie) an effective system of inspection to be instituted, to verify that theagreements are being observed, together with aerial and groundinspection to reduce the danger of surprise attack.17. A plan on these lines was endorsed by the United Nations by the overwhelming majority of 56 to 9. The only opposition came from thecountries of the Soviet bloc, who not only voted against it, but subsequentlydeclared their intention to boycott all further proceedings of the united nations Disarmament Commission.18. More recently, the Governments of N.A.T.O. jointly declared inParis that they are ready to discuss the latest Soviet proposals, togetherwith the Western proposals and any other proposals from any otherquarter. These discussions need not, of course, be confined to the subjectof disarmament. The first step towards disarmament is not necessarily adisarmament agreement. If some progress could be made towards thesettlement of one or more of the outstanding political problems, big or small, it would help to create a more favourable atmosphere in whichthe question of disarmament could be pursued with a better prospect ofsuccess.19. If such an agreement could be reached the prize for humanity wouldbe tremendous. Therefore, despite the frustrating experience of previous negotiations, which have been used as a sounding board for communist propaganda, it would be unthinkable to give up trying, until every conceivablepossibility has been exhausted.3
20. Though optimism must be tempered by past disappointment. her majesty&apos;s Government will approach any further discussions withoutprejudice and with the will to make them succeed. It would be unrealisticnot to recognise the difficulties. But. given sincerity and perseverence on both sides, it should not be impossible to find some fair and workable methodof composing the differences which at present divide, impoverish and endanger the world.21. Hope lies in the fact that disarmament is obviously just as muchin the true interests of Russia as of every other country.22. But, even with the best intentions, these negotiations are bound tobe very complicated and consequently protracted; and when an agreement has been reached, its full implementation will inevitably take a number ofyears. Meanwhile, the free world cannot alford to lower its guard. Untildisarmament is actually achieved, the utmost vigilance and preparednessmust be maintained. There can be no letting up in anticipation of a settlement which, however much the West desires it, may not necessarily materialise.Collective Defence23. The protection of the free world against the Communist threat mustincreasingly be treated as a single problem, and must be undertaken bythe collective effort of all the countries concerned. This idea of collective defence inspired the creation of N.A.T.O., the Baghdad Pact and S.E.A.T.O.Through these three regional systems, which include other members of theCommonwealth, Britain will continue to make her main contribution to thejoint task of preserving peace.24. If the full benefits of collective defence are to be obtained, themembers of the alliance must be prepared to accept that they will inevitablybecome more and more inextricably dependent on one another. the concept of interdependence in defence planning of all kinds was formallyenunciated by President Eisenhower and the Prime Minister in Washington last october and was subsequently endorsed by the Heads of the fifteen Govern-ments of N.A.T.O. The adoption of this principle will unavoidably raise,in each of the countries concerned, military, economic and political problemsof varying kinds. This applies in particular to countries like Britain whichare members of more than one defence system and have also independentoverseas responsibilities of their own. But, in view of the unquestionablebenefits to the common cause, ways must be found of overcoming these difficulties, as far as is practicable.25. The policy of interdependence is particularly applicable to theNorth Atlantic Alliance, which has an international command with a joint planning organisation. Within this integrated structure, it should be possiblegradually to get away from the idea that each member nation must continueto maintain self-contained national forces, which by themselves are fullybalanced. Instead, each should seek to make the most useful contributionit can to the combined forces of the alliance as a whole.26. Equally important advantages are obtainable from collective actionin the technical and industrial fields.   The members of N.A.T.O. possess4
26. Equally great advantages are obtainable from collective action inthe technical and industrial fields. The members of N.A.T.O. possess betweenthem the world&apos;s greatest manufacturing and scientific capacity. If research and production could be jointly planned, considerable economies in timeand resources could undoubtedly be secured, particularly in regard toweapon development. Within the framework of the Western european union. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have, during the current year, initiateddiscussions on this subject, with the French, German and DutchGovernments. Technical studies are now proceeding, and it is intended indue course to set up appropriate machinery to co-ordinate these bilateralefforts. Close co-operation is being maintained with the United States and canada on a number of important projects. If the American Congressapprove the proposal to amend the Atomic Energy Act. the scope for fruitfulcollaboration will be greatly extended. In that event, the British research and development programme will be reviewed, with the object of eliminatingduplication and ensuring the most effective contribution to the joint needsof the Western Alliance.27. In the Baghdad Pact and S.E.A.T.O. where different conditionsapply, measures to achieve the highest practical degree of co-operation arebeing taken. Efficient combined planning organisations have been set up within both these alliances, and action is being pursued to strengthen andco-ordinate the forces of the member States.Nuclear Deterrent28. These three regional defence organisations together provide a vitally-necessary defensive shield. It is of the highest importance that the frontiers of the free world, particularly in Europe, should be resolutely defended on theground and it should be made clear beyond all doubt that aggression will be resisted. But the effectiveness of these shield forces depends ultimately on thefact that behind them stands the immense nuclear power of the West, whichmust be regarded as part and parcel of the allied defence system. Thiscontinues to rest primarily upon the strength and constant readiness of theAmerican Strategic Air Command, with its bases all round the world and itsvast supply of megaton bombs.29. Britain is now making an increasingly significant contribution to theWestern nuclear deterrent. She has a substantial and growing stockpile ofkiloton weapons, the design of which is being steadily improved as a resultof the experience gained from the trials at the Maralinga proving ground inAustralia. Following upon the successful thermo-nuclear tests at christmas island, British megaton bombs are now in production and deliveries to theRoyal Air Force have begun.30. The British strategic bomber force, which is equipped to carry thesebombs, provides a mobile and flexible form of military power. While based in Britain, its aircraft can be transferred within a few hours to stationsoverseas. The majority of the squadrons are equipped with Valiants; butthe proportion of Vulcans and Victors, with their greater performance, is increasing. These can fly as high and as fast as any bombers in service,in any other country; and the accuracy of their navigational and bomb-aiming equipment is unsurpassed.    In addition, good progress is being5
169  iSECRET *made with the development of propelled bombs, which can be released froma considerable distance, thereby making it unnecessary for the aircraft to fly into the more heavily defended target area.31. Britain&apos;s nuclear power cannot, of course, be compared in magnitudewith that of the United States. Nevertheless, when equipped with megatonweapons, the British bomber force will in itself constitute a formidabledeterrent.32. If the deterrent influence of the bomber force is to be fully effective,it must not be thought capable of being knocked out on the ground.Measures are accordingly being taken to raise its state of readiness, soas to reduce to the minimum the time needed for take-off. Other action is also being taken to increase the security of the bomber force. In orderto obtain the earliest possible warning of the approach of hostile aircraft,the organisation of the radar watch is being improved and is being more fully linked with the system on the Continent.33. Now that Britain has a substantial strategic bomber force and a growing stockpile of nuclear weapons of her own, it has become necessary toco-ordinate operational plans with the United States Air Force.34. Following upon the decision, announced a year ago. that it was not practicable to attempt to defend the country as a whole against nuclear attack,Fighter Command now has the more limited task of protecting the bomberbases; and its strength is being correspondingly reduced. When the Russians,in addition to their manned bomber force, have ballistic rockets in sufficient numbers, capable of knocking out airfields in Britain, the value of a fighterdefence system will obviously decrease; and the same will apply to a missiledefence system, effective only against aircraft. But that point has not yet beenreached. Meanwhile, the squadrons of Fighter Command will continue to play their part in defending the deterrent. British short-range ground-to-airmissiles will begin to be deployed during the coming year, and a longer rangetype is in course of development. In the testing of these weapons theWoomera rocket range in Australia is playing an invaluable part.35. Britain&apos;s contribution to the strategic deterrent will representsomewhat less than one-fifth of the total Defence Estimates for 1958-59. this figure includes the cost of the strategic bomber force and its nuclear bombs and of the fighter force and radar system in Britain. It also covers the costof research and development related to the deterrent and its defence, includingguided missiles and ballistic rockets. About half the expenditure on the deterrent is at present going into forces and equipment for its defence. Onthe basis of present plans and estimates, it does not seem likely that the costof the deterrent will increase significantly over the next few years.36. The Western nuclear deterrent will shortly be supplemented byIntermediate-Range Ballistic Missiles, and Her Majesty&apos;s Government have,accepted the offer of the United States Government to supply Britain withsuch weapons. The Agreement setting out this arrangement will becompleted very shortly and its terms will be published.37. These American rockets cannot, of course, be regarded as an element of independent British nuclear.power, but they represent a valuable additionto the. combined strength of the allied strategic deterrent.   Meanwhile, a6
&quot;Ji&quot; .  . 17SECRETBritish ballistic rocket of more advanced design is being developed, on thehighest priority, in close co-operation with the United States. This will carry a megaton warhead, and is being designed for launching from underground.Conventional Forces38. The strategic nuclear deterrent is the decisive factor in preventingmajor war. But the very success of the deterrent compels the CommunistPowers to adopt other methods to achieve their stated goal of worlddomination. It must be expected that they will now increasingly concentratetheir efforts upon political subversion, economic penetration and, where the risks are not too great, indirect military action. The strategic deterrent doesnot obviate the need for maintaining a substantial shield of land forces, with air and naval support, to defend the frontiers of the free world. Nor couldit, of course, be used in localised emergencies, still less for preserving order and stability. For these tasks, which represent a large part of the presentresponsibilities of all three Services, conventional forces equipped with non-nuclear weapons are required. A high proportion of Britain&apos;s military effort will therefore, of necessity, continue to go into forces of this kind.39. In addition to her contribution to the Western nuclear deterrent,and to the forces of N.A.T.O. on land, in the air and on the sea, britain is at present maintaining over 100,000 men of the three Services in the far east and the Middle East.40. The widely dispersed nature of British military responsibilitiesmakes it essential for the Army to maintain a strong Central Reserve sup-ported by an adequate fleet of aircraft to carry reinforcements rapidly to anypart of the world. A proportion of this reserve will be kept at a high state of readiness, so that it can be moved at short notice. In order to facilitateair transport, heavy equipment, vehicles and other supplies will be storedat focal points, such as Singapore.41. At present R.A.F. Transport Command is equipped with Hastingsand Comet aircraft for long-distance lifts and with Beverleys for transportationwithin the theatre of operations. These will be supplemented by Britannias,of which twenty have been ordered. This will greatly expand the Command&apos;slong-range troop-carrying capacity.42. Close co-operation continues to be maintained between the armed forces of the United Kingdom and those of other members of the Common-wealth. Australia and New Zealand are sharing with Britain the task of supporting Malaya. The Royal Rhodesian Air Force is playing its part in middle East defence, and a squadron is at present at Aden. Discussions on defence have recently been held with the Union of South Africa. The royal navy periodically carries out joint exercises with the naval forces of all other commonwealth countries.43. By the end of March, the strength of the British Army of the Rhinewill have been reduced by 13,000 to about 64,000: and the Council of theWestern European Union has agreed to a further reduction to 55,000 duringthe coming year. In this connection, the Government have, in accordancewith the revised Brussels Treaty, asked the North Atlantic Council to considerthe financial problem involved in maintaining their forces in Germany. Thecost next year is estimated at  115 million, including about  44 million inDeutschmarks.  The independent experts, appointed by N.A.T.O. to examine7
Sea Power44. During the past year, the Government have reviewed the role,composition and disposition of the Royal Navy. British naval forces mustbe fitted to perform three main tasks:  In peacetime, to help carry out Britain&apos;s responsibilities in colonies andprotected territories, to defend British shipping and generally to contributeby their presence to the maintenance of peace and stability ;in limited war, to protect sea communications, to escort troops and supplies to the theatre of operations and give them support in action ;in global war, to make an effective contribution to the combined naval forces of the Western Alliance.45. East of Suez it is proposed to main a balanced, all-purposefleet of appreciable strength. This is necessary to enable Britain to dischargeher obligations to S.E.A.T.O. and the Baghdad Pact alliances, and to fulfilher independent military commitments in that area.46. This Eastern Fleet will be based on Singapore. It will be composedof one aircraft carrier (with a balanced complement of strike, fighter and anti-submarine aircraft), one cruiser, and a number of destroyers, frigates and smaller vessels. It will also include a converted carrier equipped to accommodate a Marine Commando force and capable of carrying helicoptersfor either the troop-carrying or anti-submarine role. These ships will operatesingly or in groups, coming together at intervals for training.47. In the Atlantic and Mediterranean the Royal Navy and maritimeaircraft of the R.A.F. will continue to play their part in N.A.T.O. Since,apart from fulfilling certain colonial responsibilities, the Royal Navy will be operating in conjunction with other allied navies, the aim will be to make themost effective contribution to the combined forces of the Alliance, and notnecessarily to provide a fully balanced all-purpose British fleet.48. Russia&apos;s formidable submarine force constitutes a threat which isof special concern to an island people, dependent upon sea communicationsfor their food supplies and economic life in peace and in war. For this reason the Government consider it desirable to concentrate the efforts of the royal navy to an increasing extent on the anti-submarine role. To fulfil this task,the naval forces in the Atlantic and Mediterranean will include two carriers(which, while containing some fighter and strike elements, will be equippedpredominantly with anti-submarine aircraft and helicopters), two cruisers anda number of destroyers, frigates and submarines.49. In addition to the main operational fleets, a small number of frigateswill, at all times, be stationed in the Persian Gulf to discharge Britishresponsibilities in that area.   Some light craft will be employed at Hong8the position, confirmed that expenditure of this order in Deutschmarks would place a heavy additional burden on Britain&apos;s balance of payments. her majesty&apos;s Government have accordingly made it clear that, in the event of adequate financial assistance not being forthcoming, they will reluctantlyhave to reconsider the size of the British land and air forces they can afford to retain on the Continent.
1 17SECRETKong for local defence, together with a frigate patrol to protect british shipping along the China Coast. A few frigates or destroyers will also bekept on the West Indies and on the South Atlantic Stations.50. The naval construction and modernisation programmes are beingaligned with this policy, and dockyard and base facilities will be curtailedto correspond with the reductions in the size of the Navy. Similarly, the plans for the Reserve Fleet are being revised. In so doing, it is proposed tofollow the principle that the Reserve Fleet should comprise only sufficientihips to keep the Active Fleet up to strength, allowing for accidents and longrefits.51. A number of important projects are in hand to ensure that the royal navy will in the years ahead continue to keep abreast of the times. A newcomprehensive radar and aircraft control system for carriers, more advancedthan any other in service elsewhere, has been introduced. A low-level tacticalbomber is being developed for the Royal Navy, and its adoption by the RoyalAir Force is being considered. The prototype will fly later this year. Thedevelopment of a British nuclear submarine is proceeding, and in this muchvaluable information and assistance is being received from the United States.Civil Defence52. Civil Defence remains an integral part of the defence plan. the framework of the local civil defence services and of the regional organisation is being maintained. Further provision will continue to be made for training schools and training equipment; and additional orders are being placed forinstruments to measure radio-activity. It is the Government^ policy toencourage the recruitment and training of the Industrial Civil Defence Service,which contributes some 200,000 volunteers towards the total of well over half a million men and women now enrolled in civil defence. Improvementscontinue to be made in the warning and monitoring system and incommunications.Contraction of Forces53. In accordance with the policy approved by Parliament, the processof reducing the size of the Forces is continuing. At the end of the year 1957-58the three Services will have a combined strength of 606,000 (Navy 99,000,Army 325,000, R.A.F. 182,000).* This represents an overall reduction of83,000 during the current year.54. An undertaking was given that those whose careers were prematurelyterminated through the contraction of the Forces would be given faircompensation and would be helped to find suitable employment in civilian life.Last July, a scheme for compensation was published in Command Paper 231.The Royal Navy have completed the selection of those to be retired. Over90 per cent, of the officers concerned, and 100 per cent, of the ratings, arevoluntary applicants. The Army and the Royal Air Force, where the problem is larger, are not so far advanced; but it is already clear that it will likewisebe possible to deal with a high proportion of the redundancies in both services on a voluntary basis.* Unless otherwise stated, manpower figures in paragraphs 53 to 65 relate to UnitedKingdom-based, adult, male personnel of all ranks, and do not include boys, women,Gurkas, Colonial troops or locally enlisted personnel.9
55. To help ex-Regulars find suitable employment a regular forcesresettlement service has been established by the Ministry of Labour inco-operation with the Services and appropriate voluntary associations. In-addition, a Resettlement Advisory Board, under the Chairmanship ofSir Frederic Hooper, has been set up, together with a number of regional commitees.56. The reduction in the size of the Army necessitates the disbandmentor amalgamation of a number of units. Last July, plans were announced for reducing the &quot;teeth arm&quot; units by 51. (The Royal Armoured Corps is to bereduced by 8 regiments ; the Royal Artillery by 21 regiments ; the royal engineers by 5 regiments : and the Infantry by 17 battalions.) By the end ofMarch 1958, 8 of these reductions will have been made. A further 22 will becarried out during 1958-59. Corresponding reductions will be made in thesupporting and administrative units.Regular Recruitment57. As announced a year ago in Command Paper 124, the Governmentare planning to bring National Service to an end by December 1962, and to rely thereafter on smaller all-regular forces of a combined strength of about375,000. By that date Britain&apos;s military commitments may quite possibly have increased or decreased; but nothing has so far happened to lead theGovernment to revise this figure or to alter its views about the prospects of recruiting the regulars needed.58. The Services have been given authority to recruit up to the followingceilings: Navy 88,000; Army 165,000; R.A.F. 135,000. The fact that these three ceiling figures for recruiting together total 388,000 does not mean thatit is intended to increase the planned strength of the combined forces beyondthe figure of 375,000 mentioned above. But the Government have felt it right for the present to maintain some flexibility.59. The Royal Navy obtains all its regulars on initial engagements of nine or twelve years. During 1957, it recruited 2,800 ratings and 4,300boys and apprentices. There is a need for some increase for recruits incertain branches, and also for the Marines, who have a higher proportion ofnational servicemen to be replaced. If there were no change in the currenttrend of recruiting, the manpower strength of the Royal Navy would be about84,000 by the end of 1962.60. In regard to the Army, the picture cannot be presented so simply,since the whole pattern of recruitment has been radically altered by thedecision to end, with few exceptions, the three-year engagement and to substitute for it an initial engagement of not less than six years. However,it is encouraging to observe that, in the first three months since the new scheme came fully into effect (November, December and January) long-termengagements have risen to 3,557, as compared with 685 in the correspondingperiod a year ago.61. Any forecasts based upon statistics over so short a period must betreated with great caution. Nevertheless, certain points are worth noting.As was expected, recruitment of men for the &quot; teeth arm &quot; units presents less10
difficulty than for most other corps. In fact, if the recruiting trend remainsas at present, the infantry, which is the basic arm, would by the end of 1962 beup to its planned strength.62. As was foreshadowed in the Defence Statement a year ago, the recruitment of men for the Army&apos;s technical, professional and administrative units raises special problems, about which it is not possible to generalise.The Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers do not appear likely tohave much difficulty in securing the numbers they need except in certain trades.On the other hand, the present recruitment rates for most of the other administrative corps are below requirements.63. During 1957, the R.A.F. recruited about 5,600 airmen on long-serviceengagements, some 3,400 boys and apprentices and about 8,500 on short-service engagements. Recruiting both of men on 9-year engagementsand of apprentices and boys showed a satisfactory increase over the previous year. As was expected, the announcement of the plan to end NationalService led to a decline in recruiting on the shorter engagements. The present rate of recruiting of pilots is almost sufficient, but that of certain otheraircrew categories will need to be increased. If there were no change incurrent recruiting rates, the regular strength of the R.A.F. would expand toabout 120,000 by the end of 1962.64. It is most desirable to augment considerably the strength of theWomen&apos;s Services, which will have an increasingly important part to play inthe new all-regular forces. There is a wide range of duties open to them athome and abroad. It is hoped that the improvements in pay, allowances andother conditions will encourage more women to enter the W.R.N.S., W.R.A.C.and W.R.A.F.65. The willingness of men and women to serve in the armed forces is determined by a wide variety of factors, psychological as well as material. Inview of the importance of obtaining the regular recruits needed to enablenational service to be ended, the Government thought it desirable to initiatea fresh and comprehensive study of this question. They accordingly set up,last November, an independent committee, under the chairmanship ofSir James Grigg, to examine the problem in all its aspects and to make recommendations. It is hoped that the committee will present their reportby the end of the summer or early autumn.Pay and Allowances66. Meanwhile, the Government have felt it right to introduce, withoutfurther delay, certain increases in the rates of pay and allowances for regularsof all ranks.   These will come into force early in April.. 67. All regular other ranks will receive an increase in weekly pay of14s., 17s. 6d., or 21s., depending on their length of engagement. In addition,the special low rate for recruits is to be abolished. In future they will receive the same rate as the &quot; one-star private&quot; or his equivalent. Thiswill mean that a recruit, enlisting on a six-year engagement, will be paid24s. 6d. a week more than at present.68. Junior officers will receive proportionately larger increases than thosein the higher ranks. For example, the pay of a Second Lieutenant will&apos; beraised by  73 a year, and that of a Lieutenant-Colonel by  109.11
69. There will be a special increase in the pay of the Women&apos;s Services,over and above the general increase. The woman recruit will receive 21s. aweek more than at present.70. The rents of Service quarters are at present abnormally low. Oneresult of this is that married officers and men for whom quarters are notavailable are liable to suffer serious financial disadvantage. To remedy this,it has been decided to increase the rate of marriage allowance, while atthe same time raising the rents of official quarters and to pay to other ranksthe &quot; out-of-quarters &quot; allowance of 3s. a day. now payable to officers. these three measures, taken together, will leave those occupying Service quarters inbroadly the same financial position as they are now, and will greatly improve the position of those not in quarters.71. Steps have recently been taken to remove various grievances andanomalies connected with allowances. For example, the scheme, under which men serving in certain oversea stations, who are separated from their families,aie granted a period of home leave, has been extended to Aden, thePersian Gulf and Habbaniya. The regulations governing the issue ofdisturbance allowance have been relaxed, so that this allowance will nownormally be payable for every move made for Service reasons, instead of onlyonce in each normal tour of duty. The unpopular system, whereby rationswere provided from Service sources for families in Germany, will shortly be changed. Certain restrictions on the use of leave travel warrants by service personnel stationed in Britain have been removed. Increases are being madein the education allowances payable to al! ranks.72. The increases in pay and allowances, and other improvementsreferred to above, will amount to about  32 millions in the year 1958-59, ofwhich  22 millions is in respect of pay. These increases will be more than offset by savings, resulting from the reduction in the strength of the forces andin the number of civilians employed by them. In fact, the total bill for pay,allowances and maintenance of Service personnel and the wages of civilianswill be lower in 1958-59 than in the previous year: and as the rundown ofthe forces proceeds, these costs will continue to decrease.Accommodation73. In addition, plans are going ahead for the improvement of accom-modation of all kinds for the armed forces at home and abroad.74. One of the attractions of Service life is the chance it offers to seethe world. The Government intend, as far as practicable, to remedy existingdeficiencies in barracks, married quarters and other accommodation overseas.As evidence of this policy, plans have recently been approved for theconstruction of additional new accommodation in Kenya, Aden, Malaya and hong Kong.75. In the United Kingdom, a comprehensive programme is being prepared for the replacement or modernisation of out-of-date barracks, messesand hospitals and the construction of considerably more married quarters, ata cost of about  90 millions over the next fiye years. The reorganisation ofthe forces unavoidably delayed decisions on the building programme, whichwill have the effect of restricting the amount of construction in the coming year. However, a number of important projects will be commenced during1958-59.   These include improvements in naval accommodation both afloat12
secret and ashore and new barracks at a number of R.A.F. stations. Importantworks already started for the Army at Colchester, Tidworth, Bovingtqn,Windsor and Bicester will be pressed forward, and new barrack and housingschemes will be put in hand during 1958, including those at Woolwich,Arborfield, Aldershot and Bordon.76. It is proposed to accelerate the provision of canteens and clubs, sportsgrounds, swimming baths and other recreational facilities. Particular attention will be paid to the needs of those serving overseas and at&apos;isolated stations athome. Work on these projects and other amenities, estimated to cost 1 million, will be carried out during the coming year.Expenditure77. For the year 1957-58, the Defence Estimates, before the deduction of expected receipts from Germany and the United States, amounted to 1,483 millions, and, after their deduction, to  1,420 millions. The admiralty and Ministry of Supply will require supplementary estimates amounting to 43 millions.78. The Defence Estimates for 1958-59 amount to  1.465 millions, before taking into account the payments in respect of the local costs of British Forcesin Germany. As in previous years, these costs, estimated at  47 millions,have been included as appropriations-in-aid. The estimates to be presented to Parliament will thus amount to  1,418 millions.79. Within these reduced estimates it has been found possible to absorb increased costs in civilian wages and prices amounting to about 50 millions, increases in Service pay and allowances costing  32 millions,compensation to officers and men prematurely retired totalling  14 millions,and a reduction of  13 millions in respect of aid from the United States.These additional charges, amounting to  112 millions, have therefore been met within estimates totalling about  2 millions less than those for 1957-58.or about  44 millions less than the original and supplementary estimatescombined.80.
