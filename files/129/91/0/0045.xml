confidential this document is the property of her britannic majestvs governmentQUESTIONS OF PROCEDURE FOR ministers. Cabinet ProcedurePreparation of Business for the Cabinet1.   The business of the Cabinet consists, in the main, of:  (i) Questions which engage the collective responsibility of the Government,either because they raise major issues of policy or because they arelikely to occasion public comment or criticism.(ii) Questions on which there is an unresolved conflict of interest between departments.All questions involving more than one Department should be examined inter-departmentally, before submission to Cabinet, so that the decisions required maybe clearly defined. When there is a conflict of interest between Departments, itshould not be referred to the Cabinet until all other means of resolving it have been exhausted, including personal correspondence or discussion between the ministers concerned.2. Proposals which involve expenditure or affect general financial or economic policy should be discussed with the Treasury and, if agreement cannot be reached between officials, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer before they are submittedto the Cabinet or to a Ministerial Committee; and the result of those discussions should be indicated in the memorandum.3. Matters which fall wholly within the Departmental responsibility of a singleMinister and do not engage the collective responsibility of the Government neednot be brought to Cabinet at all. A precise definition of such matters cannot begiven, and in borderline cases a Minister is well advised to bring the matter before his colleagues.4. These rules do not limit the right of Ministers to submit to the cabinet memoranda setting out their views on general issues of policy.5. When a Minister wishes to raise a matter orally at the Cabinet, the PrimeMinister^ consent should be sought through the Secretary of the Cabinet.6. Memoranda for the Cabinet should be as brief and as clear as possible.Time spent in making a memorandum short and clear will be saved many times overin reading and in discussion; and it is the duty of Ministers to ensure that this is done by personal scrutiny and, where necessary, revision of memoranda submittedto them by their officials.The model memorandum explains at the outset what the problem is, indicatesbriefly the relevant considerations, and concludes with a precise statement of thedecisions sought. It is sometimes useful to include a summary of the main pointsbrought out in the body of the memorandum, but such a summary should neverexceed a few lines. Prefatory covering notes should be avoided. To facilitatereference in discussion, paragraphs should be numbered.If it is necessary to refer repeatedly to a body with a long title, an abbreviatedversion may be used if on the first mention the full title is given and the abbreviationadded in brackets, e.g., &quot; The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.).&quot;7. Save with the Prime Ministers permission, which will be granted only for reasons of extreme urgency, a memorandum may not be set down on the agenda for discussion by the Cabinet until two working days after it was circulated.8. Cabinet memoranda (as distinct from memoranda for Cabinet Committees)are normally reproduced by the Cabinet Office, the text being sent by the originatingDepartment to the Cabinet Office for the purpose. If for any reason a cabinet memorandum is reproduced by the originating Department, all copies should be sentto the Cabinet Office, and application should be made to the Cabinet Office for any additional copies required by the reproducing Department. The same rule applies
to memoranda reproduced by Departments for consideration by Cabinet Com-mittees: all copies made should be sent to the Cabinet Office for circulation. Ifan originating Department so wishes, a standing arrangement may be made whereby the Cabinet Office will automatically supply for its use a fixed number of additionalcopies of memoranda.9. In no circumstances, other than those mentioned in the preceding para-graph, are Cabinet memoranda to be reproduced or copied in Departments. If a department requires additional copies of a memorandum, application must in every case be made to the Cabinet Office.A ttendance at Cabinet10. Cabinet meetings take precedence over all other business. If a memberof the Cabinet, or a Minister summoned for a particular item, is unable for any reason to be present at a Cabinet meeting, he should notify the Secretary, whowill inform the Prime Minister and will also consider whether any rearrangement of business is required.11. Ministers&apos; private secretaries can help the Secretary of the Cabinet byindicating, when asking for a subject to be placed on the Cabinefs Agenda, which ministers other than members of the Cabinet are likely to be concerned, so thatarrangements may be made for their attendance.12. The Prime Ministers Private Secretary is responsible for ensuring that theproceedings of the Cabinet are not disturbed. To assist him, Ministers should give instructions that messages are not to be sent to them while in Cabinet unless theyare so urgent that they cannot wait until the end of the meeting.13. The Secretary should be informed of Ministers&apos; out-of-town engagements,and also of their week-end and holiday arrangements so that, if some suddenemergency arises, he may be able to inform the Prime Minister at once which ministers are immediately available.Cabinet Conclusions14. The record of the Cabinefs proceedings is limited to the decisions taken and such summary of the discussion as may be necessary for the guidance of thosewho have to take action on them. The Secretary is under instructions to avoid,so far as practicable, recording the opinions expressed by particular Ministers.Matters of exceptional secrecy may be recorded in a Confidential Annex.15. Any suggestions for amendment of Cabinet Conclusions must reach theSecretary not later than the next day but one following that on which the meeting was held. Thereafter the Conclusions will be sent to be printed.16. Ministers are responsible for giving such instructions to their departments as may be necessary to give effect to the Conclusions of the Cabinet, and for com-communicating to subordinate Departments or branches decisions of which they shouldbe made aware. Where an urgent matter arises in Cabinet unexpectedly, and adecision is reached requiring immediate action by a Department not represented at the meeting, the Secretary will ensure that the Department concerned is notifiedforthwith.17. When a Department has to take action upon, or is otherwise directly affected by, a particular Conclusion, the actual decisions of the Cabinet on that matter may be copied in the Department, together with so much of the record of thediscussion as is essential to a proper understanding of them, and these extracts maybe passed to responsible officers in the Department, as may be necessary. Thedistribution of such extracts within a Department should be limited to the occasions on which it is strictly necessary for the efficient discharge of public business, and care should be taken to see that extracts are sent only to those officers of the Depart-ment who need be acquainted with the actual terms of the decision. Where action has to be taken at once by a Department, application may be made to the Secretaryfor an advance copy of the relevant Conclusions.Return of Cabinet Documents18. Cabinet documents are the property of the Crown. Ministers relinquish-ing office should hand over to their successors those Cabinet documents which arerequired for current administration and should return all others to the Cabinet
Office. A former Minister may at any time have access in the Cabinet Office to copies of Cabinet or Cabinet Committee papers issued to him while in oitice.To facilitate the recovery of Cabinet and Cabinet Committee papers and toensure their safe custody Ministers are asked during their tenure of ofnce to arrangefor the regular return to the Cabinet Office (at intervals of, say, three to six months)of such Cabinet documents as are not required for current administration.On a change of Government, the outgoing Prime Minister issues special instructions about the disposal of the Cabinet papers of his Administration.Cabinet Committees19. The procedure outlined above applies mutatis mutandis to ministerial committees of the Cabinet.While Committee meetings provide a useful forum for the discussion of policyand for enabling Ministers to ensure that their points of view are understood andto make a contribution to the formulation of policy, their prime object is thedespatch of business and the making of decisions. Attendance should be restricted to the permanent members and other Ministers who have a major interest in thequestion under discussion.Collective Responsibility20. Decisions reached by the Cabinet or Cabinet Committees are normallyannounced and defended by the Minister concerned as his own decisions. Theremay be rare occasions when it is desirable to emphasise the importance of some decision by stating specifically that it is the decision of Her Majesty&apos;s Government.This, however, should be the exception rather than the rule. The growth of anygeneral practice whereby decisions of the Cabinet or of Cabinet Committees were announced as such would lead to the embarrassing result that some decisions ofGovernment would be regarded as less authoritative than others. Critics of adecision reached by a particular Committee could press for its review by someother Committee or by the Cabinet, and the constitutional right of individual ministers to speak in the name of the Government as a whole would be impaired.21. The method adopted by Ministers for discussion among themselves of questions of policy is essentially a domestic matter, and is no concern of parliament or the public. The doctrine of collective responsibility of Ministers depends, inpractice, upon the existence of opportunities for free and frank discussion betweenthem, and such discussion is hampered if the processes by which it is carried onare laid bare. For these reasons it is also the general practice to avoid, so far aspossible, disclosing the composition and terms of reference of Cabinet Committeesand, in particular, the identity of their Chairmen.II. Precautions against Unauthorised Disclosures of Information22. Disclosures in the Press of matters under discussion by the Cabinet or its Committees damage the reputation of the Government and impair the efficiency of its administration.23. Ministers who share the collective responsibility for the governments programme must be kept generally aware of the development of important aspectsof Government policy. But outside this narrow circle knowledge of these matters should be confined to those, whether Ministers or officials, who are assisting inthe formulation or execution of the particular policy concerned, or need to know what is afoot because of its effect on other aspects of public business for whichthey are responsible.24. Government policy should not be discussed with persons outsideGovernment service unless this is necessary for the transaction of public business.Care should be taken to see that no discussions of Government policy are held in places where they may be overheard.25. Ministers are personally responsible for ensuring that all members oftheir staffs understand the need for exercising the strictest discretion, and for seeing
that the appropriate precautions are strictly observed in their Department Thefollowing considerations should be borne in mind:  (i) While it is within the discretion of Ministers to decide which of their advisers or subordinates should be shown Cabinet papers, the normal rule is that such papers should not be seen by any save their immediate advisers concerned in the formulation of policy. In particular, cabinet papers should not be circulated as a matter of course to information officers or their staffs.(ii) A Minister who is a member of the Cabinet has responsibilities wideithan those of his own Department, and will in that capacity receive some documents which are of no concern to any of his subordinates.(iii) A Parliamentary Private Secretary is not a member of the Government;and the information given to him should be correspondingly limited&apos;Only exceptionally, and with the express authority of his Minister,should he be shown Cabinet or Cabinet Committee papers or othersecret official papers. The information given to him should be limitedto what is strictly necessary for the discharge of his Parliamentary andpolitical duties.(iv) Documents reflecting the personal views of Ministers are in a specialcategory, and their handling requires special care. It is contrary tothe doctrine of collective responsibility to make known the attitude of individual Ministers on matters of policy.(v) If occasions arise on which it is necessary that any considerable numberof officers should be consulted on particular issues arising out of cabinet memoranda, this should be done by means of minutes addressed to theofficers concerned, confined to the particular points on which they arerequired to advise, thus avoiding a wide circulation of the memorandathemselves.(vi) Experience has shown that leakages of information have often occurredas a result of the skilful piecing together, by representatives of the Press,of isolated scraps of information gathered from several sources, eachin itself apparently of little importance. The only safe rule is, thereforenever to mention such matters even in the form of guarded allusions,except to those who must be informed of them for reasons of State,until the time has come when disclosure, in whole or in part, is authorised. Reasons of State may require, in appropriate cases, the confidential communication of some information to a responsible editor,lobby correspondent, &amp;c, for purposes of guidance; but such communication is only justified where it can be assured that theconfidence and the terms on which it is made are respected.26. Secrecy cannot, however, be secured solely by rules restricting the circulation of papers. Public business cannot be transacted without a fairly widedissemination &quot;of confidential information within Government circles, and theessential need is for the observance of a high standard of discretion by all whoacquire knowledge of such information in the course of their duties an attitude of mind which puts first the interests of the Government as a whole and subordinateseverything to that end. It is the duty of Ministers to set this standard of discretion in regard to all confidential matters which come within their knowledge, to give an example to others, and to see that their example is followed.III. Ministeral Speeches, Broadcasts, &amp;c.27. In public speeches Ministers should exercise special care in referring tosubjects which are the responsibility of other Ministers. They should keep withinthe ambit of approved Government policy, and should not anticipate decisions notyet made public. In all cases of doubt they should consult the Minister concerned.28. The Foreign Office should always be consulted before any mention is madeof matters affecting foreign affairs or relations with foreign Powers; and Ministerswishing to refer to matters of defence policy should in all cases first consult the
Minister of Defence. Ministers should also be specially careful in referring to matters affecting our relations with self-governing Commonwealth countries, or tothe political aspects of Colonial affairs (e.g., self-government in certain Colonies)and on these points should consult the Commonwealth Secretary or colonial secretary respectively, unless the matter to be mentioned falls wholly within theirown responsibility.29. In the present international situation special care is needed in conver-sations at social functions at Embassies or at other functions at which foreigndiplomatic representatives are present. If matters of foreign policy are discussed at such functions, a note should be made afterwards of the salient points of the conversation and a copy sent to the Foreign Secretary.30. Unless they have first obtained the agreement of the Leader of the Houseof Commons, Ministers should avoid saying anything which might affect theprogramme of Government business in Parliament. Thus, they should not without this agreement promise White Papers, the publication of which might result in ademand for a special debate; and legislation should never be promised without the express approval of the Cabinet or the Legislation Committee.By-Elections and Local Government Elections31. Members of the Cabinet should not normally speak at by-elections; but other Ministers, including those of Cabinet rank, may do so. As a general ruleMinisters above the rank of Parliamentary Secretary should not speak at localgovernment elections. There may, however, be occasions on which a Minister may feel obliged to do so for special reasons, particularly in his own constituency.Broadcasting Arrangements32. The following notes on broadcasts by Ministers have to be read againstthe background that the decision whether a person is to broadcast rests with the broadcasting authorities. There is no legal sanction or formal agreement oranything else which requires them to accept a particular broadcaster. Strictlyspeaking, therefore, there must be an invitation. It can, of course, take the formof a favourable response to a request, an acquiescence in a suggestion, or an actualinvitation by the Corporation on its own initiative. Whatever the form, it is in essence an invitation by the broadcasting authority.33. Broadcasting by Ministers is, in large part, subject to agreements betweenthe major political parties, which provide for:  (a) Party Political Broadcasts on sound and television on a quota basis.   Thearrangements are made on decisions taken by the Prime Minister.(b) Budget Broadcasts (i.e., by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and a memberof the Opposition in reply) which are to be regarded as a special seriesof Party Political Broadcasts. The arrangements are made, by theChancellor of the Exchequer and through the usual channels.(c) &quot; Ministerial Broadcasts &quot; which are described as being &quot; purely factual orexplanatory of legislation or administrative policies approved byParliament, or in the nature of appeals to the nation to co-operate in national policies, such as fuel economy or recruiting, which require the active participation of the public. Broadcasts on State occasions alsocome in the same category.&quot; By the present practice these are made only on the B.B.C. services, and the use of television for the purpose isrestricted to a small number of major occasions a year. Thearrangements with the B.B.C. provide for a right of reply when theOpposition successfully claim that the Minister has been controversial.Ministers intending to broadcast should communicate with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster who will be responsible for obtaining the Prime Minister^ approval. Because of the possibilityof the Opposition^ claiming a reply, the subject of the broadcast should in all cases be given, and the Prime Minister may require to see eitheran outline or the text of a broadcast before giving his approval.34. The agreements referred to above do not preclude the broadcasting authorities from inviting whom they please, including Ministers, to broadcast on
sound and television. The following are additional classes of broadcasts by which ministers may be affected:  (d) News Reports: the B.B.C. and I.T.A. are, naturally free to includeappearances by Ministers in the course of their normal news reports,but it would be inconsistent with the agreement between the Parties if a&apos;so-called news report was in fact a &quot; Ministerial Broadcast&quot;(category (c) above), not only because the use of television (as distinct from sound broadcasting) for Ministerial broadcasts is confined to theB.B.C. and to a small number of major occasions, but also because no right of reply exists as a matter of course in the case of a news report.Care is therefore necessary to see that such occasions are no more thannews reports. This will, in all probability, be so when the Press and broadcasting authorities attend spontaneously, as, for example, when a Minister holds a full-scale Press Conference at which visual reportingis permitted, or when he arrives at an airport on returning from a visitabroad. The more a Minister says on a &quot; news &quot; occasion, the moredoes the character of the broadcast approximate to that of a&quot; Ministerial Broadcast&quot; rather than of a news report. The Ministermust make the decision whether to accept an invitation to broadcasta news report, but the offices of the Prime Minister and the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster should be notified.(e) Invitations to Ministers to Broadcast on the initiative of the B.B.C. or theI.T.A.: such occasions may be of the B.B.C. &quot; Press Conference &quot; typein which a Minister or a member of the Opposition is invited, fromtime to time, to be questioned on the air by a group of Press represen-tatives of varied opinions. But, on the other hand, invitations may befor direct talks by the Minister and may be indistinguishable from&quot; Ministerial Broadcasts.&quot; The Opposition have protested to theB.B.C. that this is an abuse. The Prime Minister^ approval should therefore be obtained before any invitation under this head is accepted.(f) There are occasions on which Ministers are invited to take part in broadcastsin a private and not a Ministerial capacity. Nevertheless the PrimeMinisters prior approval should be obtained before such invitationsare accepted.35. Broadcasting by sound and by television is a useful instrument forconveying the British point of view to people in other countries. But before ministers commit themselves to making broadcasts over foreign wireless systemsthey should first consult the Foreign Secretary and any other Minister who may be concerned with the subject of the broadcast. They should then seek the permission of the Prime Minister.If Ministers are invited to broadcast while on a visit to another country theyshould seek the advice of Her Majesty&apos;s representative in that country beforeaccepting the invitation.IV. Press Articles and Interviews by MinistersPress Articles36. Ministers are precluded from the practice of journalism in any form;but this prohibition does not extend to authorship or to writings of a literary,historical, scientific, philosophical or romantic character. For these there are numerous and respectable precedents.37. This rule need not be interpreted as debarring a Minister fromcontributing an article or a letter to a newspaper, on occasion, for the purpose of supplementing other means of informing the public about the work of his department. In deciding whether to write an article, a Minister should bear inmind his obligations to Parliament: for example, he should not discuss a Bill before it has received its Second Reading in the House of Commons. Ministers should not accept payment for such articles. While a Minister may occasionally write a letterto a newspaper, it is not in general desirable that Ministers should engage incontroversy in the correspondence columns of the Press. A Minister should not inany event do so without first obtaining the Prime Ministers authority.38.  This rule governs dealings with the foreign as well as the home Press.
Party Publications39. The rule in paragraph 36 does not debar Ministers from contributing tothe publications of the political organisations with which they are associated.Payment should not be accepted for such articles.Interviews40. A Minister may decide in his discretion whether he should grant specialinterviews to individual Press representatives, bearing in mind that an interviewgranted to a representative of a single newspaper or agency may arouse jealousyin the rest of the Press. As a general rule, the same considerations apply tointerviews as to written articles (see paragraph 37 above).V. Parliamentary Private Secretaries41. Parliamentary Private Secretaries occupy a special position which is not always understood by the general public, either at home or abroad. They arenot niembers of the Government, and should be careful to avoid being spoken of as such. They are Private Members, and should therefore be afforded as great a liberty of action as possible; but their close and confidential association with ministers necessarily imposes certain obligations on them, and has led to thegenerally accepted practice set out in the following paragraph.42. Parliamentary Private Secretaries should not make statements in theHouse or put Questions on matters affecting the Department with which they are connected. They should also exercise great discretion in any speeches or broadcastswhich they may make outside the House, taking care not to make statements which appear to be made in an official or semi-official capacity, and bearing in mind atthe same time that, however careful they may be to make it clear that they arespeaking only as Private Members, they are, nevertheless, liabie to be regarded asspeaking with some of the authority which attaches to a member of theGovernment. Generally they must act with a sense of responsibility and with discretion; and they must not associate themselves with particular groupsadvocating special policies.VI. Absence of Ministers from the United Kingdom43. Any member of the Cabinet or Minister in charge of a Department who wishes to be absent from the United Kingdom, whether on duty or leave, shouldtake the following steps:  (i) The Foreign Secretary, Commonwealth Secretary or Colonial Secretary(as appropriate) should be consulted. Concurrently the PrimeMinisters Private Secretary should be informed that a visit is underconsideration.(ii) The Prime Minister^ approval should then be obtained.(iii) After the Prime Ministers approval has been obtained, the minister should seek The Queen&apos;s permission to leave the country. At the sametime Her Majesty should be informed of the arrangements made forthe administration of the Ministers Office during his absence.Other Ministers who propose to leave the United Kingdom, whether on duty or on leave, need not obtain The Queen&apos;s permission to do so. They should,however, after obtaining the consent of their own Minister, take the action at (i)and (ii) above.44. When a Minister is to be away from London, his Parliamentary secretary will normally take Ministerial charge of the Department. On some occasions,however, it may be desirable that arrangements should be made for another minister of Cabinet rank to hold himself available to give political guidance to officials of the Department and to represent the Departments interests in discussions in Cabinet or Cabinet Committees. Any such arrangements, if notinitiated by the Prime Minister, should have his prior approval.When one Minister of Cabinet rank is acting in this way on behalf of another,special care must be taken over the exercise of statutory powers. With someexceptions the powers of a Secretary of State can be exercised by another Secretaryof State; and the powers of a Board or Council may be exercisable in the absenceof its principal member. But for the most part the powers of a Minister cannot
be exercised by a Minister in charge of another Department; and a Minister who is acting for an absent colleague should be careful to avoid appearing formally toexercise powers which are expressed by statute as exercisable by his colleague.There is no similar difficulty about submissions to Her Majesty. Submissionsmade in the absence of a Minister should be made by his parliamentary secretary if he is a Privy Counsellor; if he is not, they may be made by another minister of Cabinet rank. Submissions on behalf of an absent Secretary of state must be made by another Secretary of State. Submissions on behalf of the FirstLord of the Admiralty may be made in his absence by the Senior lord commissioner.45. Occasional visits by Ministers to territories and services overseas forwhich they are responsible (e.g., a visit by a Colonial Office Minister to a Colonyor by an Admiralty Minister to a Royal Naval establishment overseas) may properly be charged to public funds. Ministers should not, however, charge to public fundsthe cost of visits to other countries made for the purpose of observing the workingof a Government service abroad analogous to that for which they are responsible in the United Kingdom.VII. Parliamentary Statements and PapersStatements after Questions46. When Parliament is in session important announcements of government policy should be made, in the first instance, in Parliament. But, if too manyannouncements are made at the end of Questions, Parliamentary business isimpeded. Furthermore if they are too frequent or too long their effect is bluntedand they may not receive adequate publicity in the Press. Ministers proposing tomake a statement after Questions, whether or not related to a Question on theOrder Paper, or to answer a Question at the end of Questions, are therefore askedto conform with the following procedure:  (a) The earliest possible notice should be given to the Prime Ministers private secretary, who will consult as necessary with the Leader of the Houseof Commons and with the Chief Whip. Particulars should be given ofthe subject matter of the proposed statement, the date on which it is desired to make it, and the grounds for making it on that date and foradopting this method of announcement. It should also be statedwhether the announcement has been approved by the Cabinet or by oneof its Committees.(b) Copies of the draft statement should be sent as soon as it is available tothe Prime Minister, to the Leader of the House of Commons and to theChief Whip. These copies should arrive not later than 10 a.m. on theday on which the statement is to be made.(c) It is at times desirable that a copy of such a statement should be shown to the Opposition shortly before it is made. If this is desired, a copyof the final text should reach the office of the Chief Whip in the Houseof Commons as early as possible and in any case not later than 2 p.m.on the day on which the statement is to be made.(d) A copy of the final text should in all cases be sent to the Speaker.ie) It may sometimes be expedient that a corresponding statement should bemade simultaneously in the House of Lords. Ministers should, where necessary, consult the Leader of the House of Lords on this point.Publication of White Papers47. Similar considerations apply to the publication of White Papers,particularly as regards the avoidance of simultaneous publication of White Papersfor which it is desired to obtain publicity. Ministers are therefore asked, eventhough the publication of a White Paper may have been approved by the Cabinet,to apply to White Papers the procedure laid down for statements after questions in paragraph 46 (a) above.48. Care must be taken to avoid any possibility of an infringement ofParliamentary privilege when publicity arrangements are made for White Papers.The accepted practice is for final revised proof copies of White Papers to be madeavailable to Lobby correspondents somewhat in advance of their being laid in the
Vote Office and for Ministers to hold a Lobby Conference if they think it desirable.The Prime Ministers Adviser on Public Relations should be consulted if there is any question of a wider advance distribution than this. Such wider distribution e.g., to industrial correspondents is to be avoided save in exceptional circumstances.VIII. Foreign Affairs49. Ministers should remember the importance of sending to the foreign secretary a note of the salient points of any discussions which they may have with representatives of foreign States. This applies to private discussions as wellas those held in the course of official business.IX. Civil Servants and Political Conferences50. Ministers should not ask civil servants to attend, still less to take partin, party political conferences. There is a standing rule in the Civil Service that civil servants in their official capacity should not accept invitations to conferencesconvened by, or under the aegis of, political organisations. To preserve the reputation of the Civil Service for being completely immune from Party allegiance,it is equally important that no civil servant should be in attendance at Partyoccasions. If a Minister wishes to have a brief to explain any of his departmentalactivities, there is no reason why a brief should not be provided, but neither the author of the brief nor an Information Officer should be present at the conference or meeting.The situation is, of course, different where a Minister requires officials to bein attendance, not to be present at the Conference or to take part in its business,but to enable him to carry out urgent departmental work.X. Ministers&apos; Private Interests51. The principles which should guide Ministers in deciding whether theymay properly continue to hold Company Directorships and similar offices havebeen stated from time to time in the House of Commons, as by Sir HenryCampbell-Bannerman in March 1906, and by Mr. Chamberlain in July 1939. the conventions at present to be observed are set out below.52. It is a principle of public life that Ministers must so order their affairs that no conflict arises, or appears to arise, between their private interests andtheir public duties.Such a conflict may arise if a Minister takes an active part in any undertaking which may have contractual or other relations with a Government Department,more particularly with his own Department. It may arise, not only if the minister has a financial interest in such an undertaking, but also if he is actively associatedwith any body, even of a philanthropic character, which might have negotiationsor other dealings with the Government or be involved in disputes with it.Furthermore Ministers should be free to give full attention to their official duties,and they should not engage in other activities which might be thought to distracttheir attention from those duties.Each Minister must decide for himself how these principles apply to him.Over much of the field, as is shown be\pw, there are established precedents; butin any case of doubt the Prime Minister of the day must be the final judge, and ministers should submit any such case to him for his direction.Where it is proper for a Minister to retain any private interest, it is the rule that he should declare that interest to his colleagues if they have to discuss public business in any way affecting it, and that he should entirely detach himself from theconsideration of that business.Ministers include all members of the Government except unpaid AssistantGovernment Whips.Directorships53. Ministers must on assuming office resign any directorships which theymay hold, whether in public or in private companies and whether the directorship
carries remuneration or is honorary. The only exception to this rule is thatdirectorships in private companies established for the maintenance of private familyestates, and only incidentally concerned in trading, may be retained subject to this reservation-that if at any time the Minister feels that conflict is likely to arise between this private interest and his public duty, he should even in those cases divesthimself of his directorship. Directorships or offices held in connection withphilanthropic undertakings should also be resigned if there is any risk of conflictarising between the interests of the undertakings and the Government.Shareholdings54. Ministers cannot be expected, on assuming office, to dispose of all theirinvestments. But if a Minister holds a controlling interest in any company,considerations arise which are not unlike those governing the holding ofdirectorships; and, if there is any danger of a conflict of interest, the right course is for the Minister to divest himself of his controlling interest in the company.There may also be exceptional cases where, even though no controlling interest is involved, the actual holding of particular shares in concerns closely associated witha Minister^ own Department may create the danger of a conflict of interest. Wherea Minister considers this to be the case, he should divest himself of the holding.Ministers should scrupulously avoid speculative investments in securities about which they have, or may be thought to have, early or confidential information likelyto affect the price of those securities.&quot; Names &quot; at Lloyds55. A Minister cannot properly continue to be a &quot; name &quot; at Lloyds while holding office as Chancellor of the Exchequer, President of the Board of Trade or minister of Transport: in such case he is required to suspend his underwritingactivities. Other Ministers need not cause their name as an underwriter to be suspended, though Ministers should not, while holding office, establish a connectionwith Lloyds without obtaining the permission of the Prime Minister.Pension Schemes56. A Minister while holding office may continue to participate in a firm&apos;pension scheme in one or other of the following ways:  (a) His pension rights up to the date of assuming office could be frozen, nofurther contributions being payable during his tenure of office.(b) Where his pension rights are secured by an insurance policy, the policy could be transferred to him and he could either pay future premiumshimself or have the policy converted into a fully paid up policy.(c) Provided that this can be done under the rules of the particular firm&apos;scheme, pension contributions could continue to be paid during histenure of office (which would then rank as pensionable employment forthe purposes of the scheme) so long as they were paid either:  (i) by the Minister alone: or(ii) by the Minister and the firm; or(iii) by the firm alone paying both the employer and employeecontributions.Arrangements involving the continuation of pension contributions, whether under (i), (ii) or (iii) of (c) above, should not be made unless the Minister is expectedto resume his former employment on ceasing to hold a Ministerial office.It must be emphasised that whatever arrangements are made they must not go outside the terms of the particular pension scheme. There would be noobjection to the alteration of the rules of a scheme so as to permit (a) or (b) above,but approval could not be given for the addition to the scheme of a special provisionallowing contributions to be continued (whether by the Minister or by the firm or partly by each) during the tenure of a Ministerial office. If Ministers have any doubt about the propriety of the arrangements they intend making, the PrimeMinisters Private Secretary may be consulted.The taxation effects of arrangements of the,above types vary according tothe particular kind of pension concerned. The Chief Inspector of Taxes(Superannuation), Somerset House, W.C. 2, would be willing to explain the effects
of any particular proposal on the taxation of both die firm and the Minister, or theMinister could, if he preferred, make his enquiry through the Financial Secretaryto the Treasury.Where pension contributions are not made under (c) above, a Minister maybe entitled to claim relief on premiums paid for a deferred annuity, subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in Part III of the Finance Act, 1956. Themaximum relief will normally be 10 per cent, of the Ministers salary (including anytaxable salary as a Member of Parliament) but reduced by the amount of any annual payments, &amp;c, which he makes and which cannot be set against other income. Ahigher limit applies to those who were born before 1916 and who do not, in respectof some other employment, either receive a pension or retain a right to a futurepension. The Chief Inspector of Taxes will be willing to give further information about this relief.XI. Visits to Constituencies57. It is the custom for Ministers when accepting invitations to visitconstituencies to inform the Members concerned. It is particularly desirable togive as much notice as possible in the case of constituencies represented by government supporters. Ministers cannot, of course, invite Members to accompanythem, but adequate notice will enable them to ensure that they receive invitationsfrom local organisers to functions of an official nature. It will also enable themto make suggestions to the Minister about the inclusion in his itinerary of placeswhich it would be helpful for him to visit.
