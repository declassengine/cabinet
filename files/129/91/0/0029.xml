It is issued for the personal use of.......................................c-(58) 29 TOP SECRET Copy No.3rd February, 1958CABINETNATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 22nd January the Cabinet approved, in principle, the proposal to increasethe National Health Service (N.H.S.) contribution by 8d. They invited me toconsider, in consultation with the Ministers concerned, the apportionment of this increase between the employee and the employer; and to submit detailed proposalsfor the implementation of this increase.  (C.C. (58) 8th Conclusions, Minute 2.)2. Annexed is a memorandum prepared by my officials, using facts agreed with the Departments concerned, to provide a basis for discussion between ministers. This sets out the alternatives, and the various considerations whichmay be taken into account.3.   Decisions are required on three points:  (a) The amount of the increase for women and juveniles.(b) The apportionment between employer and employee.(c) The treatment of the self-employed and non-employed (Classes II and III).No difficulty arises about (a). I have discussed (b) and (c) with the other ministers concerned, with the results shown below.Apportionment between Employer and Employee4. In my view the Health Service contribution ought to be paid mainly bythe employee, since the benefits are enjoyed by him and his dependants. Politicallyit is easier to defend an increase which adheres to the principles laid down by theLabour Government. If we are to adhere as closely as possible to the presentproportion of 5 to 1, or to the original Labour Government proportion of nearly6 to 1, the right way to split the extra Sd. is Id. :\d.\ a 6d.: 2d. split is slightly lessaccurate, and fractions of a penny are not feasible. Moreover, as the tableannexed to the memorandum shows, every penny which is put on the employerreduces the annual net yield to the Exchequer and increases the Government^own expenditure.5. There are also the presentational aspects to be considered. The Ministerof Pensions sees some advantage in a 50/50 split. He takes the view that theproposed increase, coming as it does so soon after that which came into force last september, cannot be presented, as last September^ change was, simply as abringing up to date of the 1946 position; and that in these circumstances a newposition has arisen which can only be justified on the grounds of financial necessity.He thinks, therefore, we should find it politically more acceptable to follow the retirement Pension principle of dividing the increase equally between employersand employees.6. The Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Health, whowill be piloting the legislation through the House, would find difficulty in arguingfor 50/50, which shows an apparent divergence from earlier precedents. Butthey would prefer 6d.: 2d. to Id.: \d., partly because the latter would mean atotal employee^ contribution of 10s. and there is thought to be some advantage in keeping it below that figure.52951
2TOP SECRET7. Though I would still prefer Id.: Id., I am prepared to accept 6d.: 2d.as a compromise and so, I understand, is the Minister of Pensions, in the contextalso of the proposals in the next paragraph.Self-Employed and Non-Employed8. The present legislation charges self-employed and non-employed, thewhole N.H.S. contribution: this suggests that they should be charged the wholeof the extra 8d. But my colleagues have represented that there is a case fortempering the wind to these classes, for which our Party traditionally have awarm regard; and that in the National&apos;Insurance field proper apart from theN.H.S. contribution the increase in the contribution under the National insurance acts, 1954 and 1957, was deliberately tempered in this way in favour of the self-employed and the non-employed. I am prepared to acquiesce in the suggestionthat the increase to be imposed on these classes should be limited to the increasebeing imposed on employed contributors.Conclusions; 9. We are agreed therefore in recommending for the Cabinefsconsideration:  (i) that the contributions in respect of women and juveniles should beincreased by 6d. and Ad. respectively;(ii) that the adult male employee^ contribution should be increased by 6d.*the woman&apos;s contribution by Ad. and the juvenile&apos;s by 2d. The increase for the employer would be 2d. in each case;(hi) that the self-employed and the non-employed should pay the sameincrease as the employee.10. This would produce a total National Insurance and Health Service stampof 18s. 2d. for the employed man, split 9s. lid. employee and 8s. 3d. employer, ofwhich the N.H.S. element is 2s. Ad. split Is. l$\d.: S\d. The total net financialbenefit to the Exchequer from these proposals would be  28-V millions in a full yearand  23-2 millions in 1958-59.11. I hope that it will be possible for the Cabinet to have before them, whenthey discuss this, the time-table of events announcement, Ways and MeansResolution, Second Reading, &amp;c.D. H.

,; ANNEX :  &apos; /V    .* ?MEMORANDUM BY officials the Cabinet have decided in principle on an increase of 8d. in the national health Service Contribution payable by art adult employed man. This paper sets out the subsidiary matters on which decisions are required.Rate of Contribution in respect of Women and Juveniles2. To maintain the existing relativities the contributions payable in respectof women and juveniles should be increased by 6d. and Ad. respectively.The Apportionment of the Increase between Employee and Employer3. At present the employee pays Is. A\d. and the employer 3\d. of the weekly adult male contribution. This 5:1 ratio follows the split between employer and employee in the original lOd. element of the N.I. contribution. This elementwas derived from the Beveridge recommendation which was based on the conceptthat it was reasonable for the insured person to make a direct contribution inrespect of the free health service which was to be made available to him and his dependants. As the employer was at that time paying l%d. a week towards thecost of medical benefit under the old National Health Insurance scheme this was continued and incorporated in the 1946 legislation. The \%d. was in fact a survivalfrom the pre-1948 insurance scheme and represented not an assertion of theprinciple that the employer should contribute towards the cost of the N.H.S. but rather the continuance of an existing obligation.4. If the further increase of %d. were to be apportioned in the same way asthe existing Is. 8d. the most exact split would be 6\d. employee, l\d. employer,with comparable provision for women and juveniles. Since additions to the presentstamps involving odd halfpennies are impracticable, the amounts can be roundedup or down without departing significantly from the original ratio and thusmaintain the existing apportionment. The alternatives, on this basis, would beId. employee, Id. employer, and 6d. employee and 2d. employer. The second ofthese would keep the total employee, N.H.S. and N.I. contribution at less than10s. (i.e., at 9s. lid.).5. Another alternative would be to split the Sd, equally between employer and employee. This would be an obvious departure from the present basis whichwould require explanation. It would put on to employers, by a direct levy related to the number of their employees, a larger share of the cost of the N.H.S. thanthey bear in this way at present. It could be argued that the maintenance of the health of his employees is an economic interest of the employer, but if this argumentis held to justify a 50:50 split of the proposed increase, the question arises of why it does not justify a similar split of last year&apos;s increase or, indeed, of the originalcontribution. Moreover, the higher the employees share is set, the greater the riskof affecting prices. There was, however, nothing sacred about the originalproportion, and a 50:50 split would keep the employed man&apos;s contributionappreciably below 10s. (i.e., 9s. 9d.). And the lower the employee^ share is set the less would be the effect on wage claims. There is little variation in the grossyield (which will be shown in the National Health Service Estimates) of the additionunder any of the alternatives but the net yield of the addition (i.e., after taking account of loss of tax revenue and the cost to the Government as an employer) is reduced the more the employees share is increased.Treatment of Self-Employed and Non-Employed (Classes II and III)6. Hitherto the self-employed and non-employed have paid the full weeklyN.H.S. contribution. If past precedent were followed this would mean that these classes would pay the proposed increases of Bd. for men and 6d. for women. Manyself-employed and non-employed people are hard pressed and there is a case onhardship grounds for limiting the increase payable by these two classes to the amount paid by the employed person. If the 50:50 split were adopted the self-employed&apos;sweekly contribution would be left below 12s. On the other hand, the existing arrangements assume that the Health Service is entitled to receive as muchaltogether in respect of a Class II or Class III person as in respect of a Class I
4TOP SECRETperson, since it provides the same benefits to all. If a concession is now made inregard to the proposed increase, this could give rise to pressure to make itretrospective, so that the total contribution paid by a Class II or Class HI wouldbe no more than the contribution of an employed person. It also opens the wayto other claims for concessions on grounds of hardship e.g., by low-paid manual workers.Financial Considerations7. The employer^ share of the contribution would rank for tax relief andthe Exchequer would lose about 30 per cent, of the total yield of the employer^contribution. The loss of tax for every \d. of the contribution charged to the employer would be about  1-2 millions in a full year. If Classes II and III donot pay the full increase there is a loss of  0-3 million in respect of each Id. whichis added to the employees contribution. Moreover, the Government, as an employer, both directly in regard to civil servants, the Armed Forces and theN.H.S. and indirectly in so far as grant is paid on other public services wouldhave to meet from Departmental Votes substantially increased charges. Thisextra charge will amount to approximately    million for every Id. which is addedto the employees share.8. The attached statement shows the financial effects of the various alternatives. It will be seen that the gross yield does not vary greatly under anyof them but the net yield does. Column V shows that as compared with alternative A, Alternative B shows an annual loss of  1-2 millions or if the self-employed and non-employed bear only the same increase as the employees 1-5 millions. Alternative C shows an annual loss of  3-65 millions if employersbear half the Sd. increase and Classes II and III bear the full increase and 4-75 millions of the latter classes bear only the same increase as the employees.appendix the following Table shows the financial effects of alternative ratios fordividing the proposed 8^. increase in the contribution between employees and employers on two alternative assumptions about the treatment of the self-employed and non-employed:  i.e., id) if the self-employed and non-employed pay the full increase of 8d.(b) if the self-employed and non-employed pay only the employee&apos;s shareof the increase (figures in square brackets).
