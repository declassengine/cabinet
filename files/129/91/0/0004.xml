ANNEX ADRAFT statement i r;se to make a statement on Cyprus.     The Governor isrepenting   this statement in Cyprus today.     Ke is also making anannouncement on measures to bring the emergency to an end in threemonths to which I shall refer at the end of my statement.2. Her Majesty!s Government have made persistent efforts to achieve agreement with the Greek and Turkish Governments on thequestion of the future of Cyprus.     In particular   Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have for some time past done their utmost to bring abouta conference between the three Governments.    Moreover Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have repeatedly made it clear that they wil? give the closestconsideration to any proposal agreeable to both the Greek and turkish governments and to both communities in the island.     Unfortunatelyall these endeavours have proved of no avail.3. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have therefore reviewed theposition in consultation with the Governor and have made the followingdecisions, which leave open the final solution:-1.   Her Majest.y&apos;s Government have already declared their acceptance of the principle of self-determination.    that declaration is reaffirmed, and Her Majesty&apos;s government now further declare their intention to achieve a settlementof the Cyprus problem on the basis of that principleseven years after the end of the emergency.2.   Her Majesty&apos;s Government at the same time stipulate asfundamental conditions of such a settlement -(a) that questions affecting the Turkish community in cyprus are fairly settled;(b) that such bases and installations as may berequired to meet the strategic requirements ofHer Majeety&apos;s Government and their allies are retained.3.   With regard to the first stipulation Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentreaffirm their assurance that the Turkish cypriot community no less than the Greek Cypriot community should be given the freedom to decide for themselvestheir own future status, i. e. that the   Turkish Cypriotsno less than the Greek Cypriots should be given the rightof self-determination as a community.4.   With regard to the second stipulation, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment&apos;s bases will be under British sovereignty.5.   It is further stipulated that during the seven year period the people of Cyprus should show that they are ready towork and maintain a representative constitution.Discussions as to the form of that constitution should beundertaken in the first instance with the Governor in cyprus.-1-TOP SECRET
4. Tf however at any time a solution for- the future of the islandis reached which is approved by the Greek and Turkish governments and by both communities in Cyprus, Ker Majesty&apos;s Government will accept it, provided that it meets the stipulation to which I have referredregarding the retention of bases.5. That is my statement.     The announcement, to which 1 referred,to be made by the Governor tcday proposes measures for bringing thestate of emergency to an end in a peiiod of three months.    A copy of theGovernor&apos;s statement will be immediately available in the Library.     it provides for a progressive release over a period of three months of thosedetained under the emergency regulations and for the revocation of theregulations at the end of the period, after which Archbishop Makarioswould be free to return to the island on his assurance that he will useall his influence for the maintenance of peaceful conditions.    At the sametime the three others excluded with him would be free to return to Cyprus.These measures for terminating the emergency will be entirely dependenton the continuation of a state of tranquility.-2-
