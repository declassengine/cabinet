ISECRET ----88(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE FRCPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 19COPY NO. ^ V23rd January, 1958CABINETAIRCRAFT FOR BRITISH EUROPEAN AIRWAYSJoint Memorandum by the Minister of transport and Civil Aviation and the Minister of supply the Opposition have chosen civil aviation as a subject for debate on Monday, 26th January.   They no doubt intend to raise as the main topicof attack the British European Airways (B.E.A.) requirement for a new jet aircraft which has been the subject of prolonged negotiations and muchrecent comment in the Press.   They will no doubt receive the benefitof some briefing from B.E.A.  We are nearly though not quite ready totake a considered decision on all the issues involved, and the debate may cause us some embarrassment if we can make no effective reply.   Wehave therefore felt it necessary to seek the advice of our colleagues.2.      The B0E.A. requirement is for delivery in 1963 to 1965 of about twenty-four short haul, pure jet aircraft, seating 70/80 (standard classseats), of high cruising speed (600 m. p. h.).   They are needed to meetthe competition of the large United States jets which will be flying into and across Europe.3.      This requirement coincides with a prospective slump in the air-craft industry caused by a sudden change in defence policy and the curtailment of both development and production of military aircraft.Quite apart from the problems of contraction with which this will face theaircraft industry, the industry is divided into too many units of too littlestrength and there is a need to concentrate its resources in order to withstand the competition of the United States industry and to exploit the growing world market for civil aircraft.   Short of legislation, her majesty&apos;s Government have no effective method of bringing this policy to fruition other than the power of contract, though economic forces willalso play their somewhat slow part.   We have therefore been considering whether it is possible to combine the objectives of meeting the B.E.A.requirement and at the same time laying the foundations for the rationalisation-tion and redeployment of resources of the aircraft industry.4.      Two groups, the Bristol Aeroplane Company in association withthe Hawker Siddeley Group, and de Havillands in association with Huntingsand Faireys are now competing for the B.E.A. order and have eachoffered to form joint companies to undertake it as a private venture.Rolls Royce have undertaken to produce the engine as a private venturefor either group.-1-
SECRET895.     The proposal which has been made by the Bristol/hawker siddeley Group offers in the view of the Minister of Supply considerable advantages from the point of view of rationalisation of the industry and ofharnessing substantial non-aircraft interests behind the development and production of civil aircraft.   It is also his view that there is a strongpossibility that unless they can be brought into the field of civil aircraft and in the absence of any new demand for military aircraft Hawkers,with their immense experience and technical facilities, will go out ofthe aircraft business altogether.   B.E.A. however, took a firm Boarddecision that they wished to order a project based on the de Havillanddesign team.   At the request of the Minister of Transport and CivilAviation they reconsidered this but re-affirmed their decision.   our efforts to bring de Havilland&apos;s and the Bristol/Hawker Siddeley Grouptogether have failed.   Since this failure de Havilland&apos;s have shownwillingness to join with certain other companies and build a new group of greater size and strength, though still not to such an extent as to match the importance of the Hawker/Bristol combination from the point ofview of the future of the industry or to match competing American units.It will require some more days of intensive negotiation to bring the revised de Havilland proposal to satisfactory completion.6.     In the view of the Minister of Supply there is a further importantcomplication in that Hawker/Bristol have at the moment in the UnitedStates a team who are negotiating with Pan-American Airways the saleof a substantial number of the Bristol aeroplane.   Indeed if the british civil aircraft industry is to have a substantial future it must be preparedto go into the export field regardless of whether or not there is a home demand.   It is of course the intention of the de Havilland group to startan export drive immediately the B.E.A. order is placed.   The differencebetween the two groups is that the Hawker/Bristol group are trying tosell their aircraft without an order from B.E.A.  In the Minister of Supply!view it may well be that while B.E.A., who are in many ways a uniquelysituated airline, incline their preference one way, world demand mayincline a different way.   If this were to turn out to be so and we hadprematurely opted for the aircraft of B.E.A. choice, the export would prove to be limited and the promise of private venture would be nullified.7.      A strong argument against the announcement of a decision onMonday is that it seems highly probable that, in the light of their UnitedStates negotiation, Hawker/Bristols will announce that they will proceedwith their project irrespective of the B.E.A. order.   We should then bein the embarrassing position of having pre-judged the balance of advantagebetween the B.E0A. preference coupled with a strengthened company underde Havilland leadership on the one hand and what the Minister ofSupply regards as an even better amalgamation of companies, plus the clear prospect of an important export order on the other.   At the same time it must be recognised that we have no power to require B.E.A. to purchasean aircraft not of their own choice, nor would the Minister of transport and Civil Aviation be prepared to do this if he had the power.   Equallyeven if the Hawker/Bristol group do receive an American order it by nomeans follows that B.E.A. would change their preference.8.      In all the circumstances we conclude that it would be wrong totake an immediate decision in favour of the de Havilland aeroplane.   we ask our colleagues to agree that --2-SECRET
(i) We should postpone any decision for a period not exceedinga fortnight in order to give time to see the results of the hawker/Bristol sales talks.    Meanwhile the latest proposalsof de Kavilland&apos;s to form a strengthened company are expectedto be in our hands on Monday next and will be examined.(ii) In the debate we should take the line that -(a) B.E.A. have expressed a preference for an aircraftdesigned under the control of the de Havilland team;(b) important questions affecting the future of civil aircraftdevelopment, and our ability to compete  in world markets are raised by the placing of the B.E.A.contract;(c) critical negotiations between one of the groups concerned and a possible overseas operator are not quiteconcluded;(d) negotiations are still proceeding between certain of the British companies concerned;(e) full consideration is meanwhile being given to all the factors involved, including the wishes of B.E.A. ,and that it is hoped to make a full statement ofGovernment policy within two weeks.H.W.A.J.rd January, 1958-3-
