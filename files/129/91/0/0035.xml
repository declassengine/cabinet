rth February, 1958CABINETBRITISH FORCES IN europe memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at our meeting on 28th January, I was invited, inconsultation with the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence,to circulate a memorandum on the minimum acceptable contribution by the German Government during the coming financial year to the localcosts involved in retaining British forces in Germany, the number of troops which it would be practicable to withdraw from Germany in the near future,and the level of British forces which we could afford to retain in germany in the longer term in the absence of any financial contribution by theGerman Government (C.C.(58) 11th Conclusions, Minute 2).2. Events have moved fast, and we aiid the North atlantic treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) are faced with a German counter-proposal to deposit  100 millions, interest free, in London against futurepayments for arms.   By itself this proposal is entirely unacceptablefor three reasons.   First of all, because it represents a loan when we wanta cash payment;   secondly, because we simply cannot afford in our presentcircumstances to borrow to meet non-productive current expenditure;   and thirdly, because it would mean receiving advance payments against possible export orders, some of which we would expect to get anyhow.The waiver of interest would be of  negligible   advantage to us.    Thepresent offer can only be of interest as an ingredient of much widerproposals which   included a substantial cash payment;  and was alsolinked to firm export orders instead of to vague promises.3. Apart from this, work is proceeding on the various pointslisted in paragraph one above.   I do not think we can usefully spend much time now on considering the minimum acceptable contribution from Germanyuntil an offer has been made which comes nearer to meeting our requirements.4. I understand that the Ministry of Defence will very shortly be able to say how quickly it would be possible to withdraw troops.5. The work on the practicable long-term level ofUnited Kingdom troops in Germany will take more time; the questionof a settlement to cover three years or more may well arise at thenext stage in the N.A.T.O. discussions, and will need very carefulconsideration:-. I think it would be premature in the new circumstancesfor us to propose such a settlement in N.A.T.O.-1-SECRET(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF KER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 35 COPY NO.

6. My colleagues will wish to consider the next steps to be taken.1 am sure that they will agree that we should say flatly why the presentoffer is no good;   continue to press N.A.TcO. to find a solution to theproblem which is on their table;  and to make no suggestion whatever thatwe should be prepared to compromise.   We shall also need to considerpossible means of putting additional pressure on the Germans, in N.A.T.O.and elsewhere.D.1U.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.7th February, 1958-2-
