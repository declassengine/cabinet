confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY&apos; OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1958C. (58) 368th February, 1958CABINETFARM PRICE review memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer we have to decide the line to be taken in discussion with the farmers&apos; Unionsduring the annual review of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry which is due to start on 12th February. This has been considered by the ministerial Committee on the Farm Price Review and 1 have been invited to submit to the Cabinet the views of the Committee. We are agreed on the major issues.There is however one reservation at this stage by the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Agriculture. This is referred to below.The Minimum Award2. The new long-term assurances under the Agriculture Act, 1957, require aminimum determination sufficient to maintain the total value of the guarantees atnot less than 974- per cent, of the total for the previous year, plus or minus cost increases or decreases that have occurred on review commodities since the lastannual review. There is a net cost increase of about  114- millions. Two and a halfper cent, of the total value of the guarantees is about  32 millions. The net result isthat we can take off from the total value of the guarantees not more than about 204.- millions.Total Value of the Guarantees3. Our view is that this year a reduction in the total value of the guarantees tothe full extent permitted under the long-term assurances is justified, though theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture wish to reserve their position on the point that a small amount of room for manoeuvre should be retainedat this stage.4.   The main factors that have led us to this conclusion are:  (i) The general economic situation requires a strict attitude to be taken to theclaims of agriculture as of other sectors of the economy;(ii) Exchequer liability is very high about  290 millions in 1957-58 and stilltending to increase, as against  240 millions in 1956-57 ; this representsabout 30 per cent, of the market value of the commodities concerned ;(iii) the net income of the industry for 1957-58 is forecast at by far the highest level ever achieved about  360 millions both on an actual basis and when adjusted to normal weather conditions, compared with 314 millions actual and  331 millions on a normal basis in 1956-57;this already meets the farmers&apos; call for an upward trend in theirincomes;(iv) net output, forecast at 63 per cent, above pre-war for 1957-58 comparedwith 61 per cent, in 1956-57, is still going up;(v) the net cost increase of  11-J- millions on review commodities is the smallest since 1954;(vi) our international relations, particularly with the Commonwealth and with western Europe, also require a strict attitude to the claims ofagriculture;(vii) our production objectives require substantial reductions in the guaranteed prices of a number of major commodities, particularly milk, pigs and eggs, all of which are being overproduced.Copy No.   ft -i52989
5. We feel that, in the circumstances of this year as set out above, this is theoccasion for a determination at the minimum permitted by the long-term assurances. Indeed, the farmers could be told that they were fortunate in theprotection afforded them by the long-term assurances, since otherwise a case fora still greater reduction could well have been made.6. The Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture feelhowever that a determination at the minimum would have presentationaldifficulties and they would not wish at this stage to preclude the possibility of a determination slightly above the minimum. The grounds that might be advanced to justify such a determination would be:  (i) it is the fall in world commodity prices that has influenced a number ofthe major factors such as Exchequer liability, and it is a purpose ofthe guarantees to protect home agriculture against the full effects ofsuch fluctuations and to allow changes necessary to meet long-termtrends to be made gradually;(ii) farm incomes have not gone up to the extent of incomes in some other sectors of the economy and, with a settlement at the minimum, theExchequer would be getting the benefit from the increasing efficiency of the industry.It would therefore be easier politically (despite the major considerations inparagraph 4 above) to present a determination a little above the minimum.Views of the farmers&apos; Unions7. The farmers&apos; Unions have been running a campaign for a determinationthat would reverse the alleged falling trend in net income and would leave farmerswith a substantial share of the increasing efficiency of the industry. Despite thesubstantially higher level of net income this year, they are likely to try to make outthat any apparent reversal of trend in net income, whether in money terms or in real terms, is due to temporary factors and is not therefore likely to continue without some further increase in the guarantees.Commodities8. The major need is to reduce substantially the guarantees on milk, pigs and eggs. It would also be desirable to reduce the guarantee on wheat. It is not desirable to increase the guarantees on any commodities, since all are reasonablyprofitable at present. We have practically reached the limit at present for usefulincreases in production grants.9. Even a determination at minus  204- millions leaves less scope than wewould like to have for reductions in the guaranteed prices of the individual commodities. The attached schedule concentrates on reductions in the guarantees for milk, pigs and eggs and there is little room for any variation. These commodities are of particular concern to the small farmers about whom we might have to give further thought. We are in any case still considering whether minor modificationsshould be made, and in particular whether room could also be found for a smallreduction in the guarantee on wheat, which is a large farmers&apos; crop.Conclusion10. On behalf of the Ministerial Committee on the Farm Price Review invite the Cabinet (i) to agree that officials should be authorised to start the discussions with the farmers&apos; Unions on the basis of a determination for the total value ofthe guarantees at the minimum permitted under the Agriculture Act,1957;(ii) to approve the general lines of the attached schedule for changes in the guarantees and to authorise us, should we find it desirable, to modifythis in minor respects before it is presented to the National Farmers&apos;Unions.D.
