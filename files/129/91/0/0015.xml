I SECRET SO(TfllS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)$ C.(58) 15 COPY NO. &quot;SZlst January, 1958- - l-IHHIII    I    111 III- I......I.MMCA3INETBRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSION:  BUS wages memorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil AviationInformed public opinion is watching very closely our attitude towardscurrent wage claims, particularly those from nationalised industries where we can be expected to have closer control.    The Governments - -attitude to the claim of the Transport and General Workers Union for anincrease of 25s. a week for the bus crews of the London transport executive, will be regarded as the test of our determination to defeatinflation.2.        The reply of the London Transport Executive (L.T.E.) to the 25s.claim has been that in the light of declining traffic receipts and the general position of the British Transport Commission^ (B.T.C.) finances, theycannot afford at this juncture to make any offer at all.    The transport and General Workers Union have refused to accept arbitration but have asked the Minister of Labour to set up a committee of enquiry to look atthe circumstances of the present dispute and to make recommendations.The first question is whether the Minister of Labour should accede to therequest.   He might conceivably refuse.   To do so would be against allprecendent and might provoke an immediate strike.   If it did so, the result might be that he would later be   compelled to set up a committee ofsome sort to settle the strike - which would look like a defeat for theG overnm ent.3.        If the committee were set up the L..T.E. have assured me that theywould say in evidence that they had not asked for the committee, and thatthey could not undertake to be bound in advance by its findings.    (The unions would no doubt refuse toba boundalso^ They would, however, of courseattend the committee and give it whatever assistance that they could.They would rej^eat that they could not make any offer at this time for thereasons already given.4.        We must however obviously consider the possibility that thecommittee however constituted would recommend some increase.    If theaward recommendation were clearly absurd, the L.T.E. have told me thatthey will reject it.   If it is not absurd, however, (and they seem to have inmind a possible award of 5s. to Central London busmen) they would,before announcing whether they accepted it or not, bring the matter to me and give me an opportunity  to consult my colleagues.    If it were then ourview that to accept a claim was not in the national interest then the L.T.E.would not pay, but we should of course have to give this advice in public.5.        It is always possible that if we do set up the enquiry and if itrecommends an increase, the union might turn down the increase.    In manyways this would be very convenient for us.    We cannot say at this stagewhat are the chances on this possible course of events.    So long as the
chance exists, however, I think that it adds to the attraction of settingup the committee and letting events take what can be presented assomething like the normal pattern of arbitration,    V/e must ensure that both the chairman and the L..T.E. nominee of the proposed committeeare likely to take a firm line.H.W,Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1.21st   January, 1958
