Uc,Copy No.-..zC.(58) 23rd January, 1956CABINETGOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE 1958/59Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the draft Estimates (civil and defence) for 1958/59 show anincrease of  153 millions over the probable actual expenditure (i. e. originaland supplementary Estimates) of the current year.2. I regard it as essential, in order to safeguard the   and to demonstrate our determination to maintain our disinflationary policy,that we should subject the Governments own expenditure to the samediscipline as we have imposed on public investment and the private sector.This implies that the excess of  153 millions must be substantiallyeliminated,,3. 3y a number of decisions in response to requests by thePrime Minister it is expected that the civil Estimates will be reduced byabout  40 millions.4. The defence Estimates are in my view capable of reductionunder the following heads:-  millions(a) Service Department Votes 12(b) Research and Development 10(c) Deferment of &quot;inducements&quot;(i. e. improvements in service pay and allowances) 26   total  48 millions this allows for the retention of  9 millions for marriage and out-of-quarters allowances.     But there is a case for omittingthe entire provision for &quot;inducements&quot; of  35 millions whichis in the Estimates.-.1-
