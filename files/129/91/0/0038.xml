ANNEX a parliamentary ANNOUNCEMENT : 18th FEBRUARY, 1958CLOSURE OF PORTLAND AND SHEERNESS DOCKYARDS;ABOLITION OF THE NORE COMMAND;RE-ORGANISATION OF HOME AIR COMMAND.With permission I will make a statement about the future of the royal dockyards, naval air establishments, and the structure of the Home Commands.Her Majesty&apos;s Government have decided, with great regret, that the NoreCommand should be abolished; that Sheerness and Portland Dockyards, theAircraft Repair Yard, Donibristle, and certain air establishments, should be closed;and that the Torpedo Experimental Establishment should be transferred fromGreenock to Portland.2. The decline in naval repair work resulting from the planned reductions in the Fleet will not require the closure of any other dockyard in the UnitedKingdom. Singapore and Gibraltar Dockyards will be retained. The future of malta Dockyard is still under consideration.3. The Nore Command will be abolished by April 1961, and its remainingfunctions transferred to other authorities. At Sheerness, the Dockyard will be rundown gradually, closing April 1960. At Chatham, the Dockyard will be retained;but the barracks and other naval establishments will be closed, also by April 1961.4. At Portland the dockyard will be reduced by July 1959. The naval basewill be retained. I have considered with particular care the final stage of the concentration at Portland of underwater research and development and havedecided that the Torpedo Experimental Establishment must be transferred therefrom Greenock in order to achieve the closest co-ordination in the development ofunderwater weapons.  This move will take place towards the end of 1959.5. The tasks of the Home Air Command will be concentrated in larger groupsat fewer bases. The Aircraft Repair Yard at Donibristle will be closed by the endof 1959. The Royal Naval Air Stations at Ford, Bramcote and Eglinton will alsobe closed in about a year&apos;s time. The Air Station at Brawdy and the Air ElectricalSchool at Worthy Down will close later.. 6. I am well aware of what these decisions will mean for Chatham men, andfor many Fleet Air Arm ratings, of the Royal Navy, and for the civilian employees of the establishments to be closed. My Right Honourable Friend the Ministerof Labour will arrange as necessary to open special employment offices inside these establishments before discharges begin. With the assistance of My right honourable Friend the President of the Board of Trade, everything possible willbe done to bring the facilities at Sheerness, Donibristle and Greenock to the noticeof suitable industrial interests. We shall enter into consultation immediately withthe staff associations and trade unions.7. Details of these plans, and of their effects, are included in my NobleFriend&apos;s Explanatory Statement on the Navy Estimates, which will be availablein the Vote Office later this afternoon.8. The result of the re-organisation will be a total reduction of about 2,700naval posts ashore and of over 7,000 civilian posts. Thus more men will beavailable to serve at sea, and an annual saving of about  7 millions will beachieved. The Government is confident that, although some hardship will be unavoidable, all those in the Naval Service will appreciate the necessity for thesedrastic measures for the purpose of maintaining the strength of the sea-goingFleet.
ANNEX BFIRST LORD&apos;S EXPLANATORY STATEMENT ON NAVY ESTIMATESExtract Relating to Parliamentary Announcement on 18th February, 1958ROYAL DOCKYARDS AND NAVAL SHORE SUPPORTDuring the last year there has been a thorough review of the future needsof the Navy ashore in order to ensure that the resources of men and money available will be used to the best advantage of the smaller Fleet.2. In particular, a most careful examination has been made of the future ofthe Royal Dockyards and naval air establishments, and of the structure of theHome Commands. It has been decided that the Nore Command should be abolished; and that Her Majesty&apos;s Dockyards at Sheerness and Portland, and theRoyal Naval Aircraft Yard, Donibristle, and five other air establishments, shouldbe closed.3. The decline in naval repair work resulting from the planned reductions in the Fleet will not require the closure of any other Dockyard in the UnitedKingdom. The closure of the Hong Kong Dockyard by the end of November,1959 was announced earlier. Singapore and Gibraltar Dockyards will be retained.At Malta the level of naval activity is likely to decline and certain British firms are examining the feasibility of taking over the Dockyard for commercial use. In thelight of the outcome of this examination, the future of the Dockyard will bedecided after consultation with the Maltese Government.The Nore Command and Sheerness Dockyard4. The post of Commander-in-Chief, The Nore, and the Nore Command willbe abolished. It is planned that the Commander-in-Chiefs present functions, in both his national and NATO capacities, will be transferred to other authorities by April 1961. Responsibility for naval establishments remaining in the Commandarea will be allocated to another Home Command.5. Sheerness Dockyard will be run down by April 1960. It is hoped to dispose of the yard before closure to industrial or commercial interests. It employssome 2,500 industrial and non-industrial staff. About 1,100 are established, ofwhom as many as possible will be absorbed into Chatham Dockyard. The balanceof unestablished employees will be reduced by normal wastage and discharge.6. At Chatham the Dockyard will be retained; but by April 1961 her majesty&apos;s Ships will normally be refitted there with only key personnel on board.It is planned to close or transfer the barracks and other naval establishments,as shown below. Deep regret is felt that it is necessary to break the long association in history, going back four centuries, of the Royal Navy with the Medway towns.Royal Naval Barracks, Chatham :To be closed by April 1961.H.M.S. Ceres (Royal Naval Supply and Secretariat School):To be housed in the Royal Naval Barracks, Chatham, for at least twoyears; then to be moved, probably to Portsmouth. (It is not possible to moveCeres straight to its final location.)Mechanical Training Establishment, Chatham:To be transferred; probably to Portsmouth by September 1960.Royal Naval Hospital, Chatham :To cease to be a naval hospital by April 1961.H.M.S. Wildfire (Royal Naval Base, Sheerness):To be closed by April 1960, or as soon as the run-down of SheernessDockyard permits.53003
Chart and Boom Defence Depots:The Chart Depot at Sheerness and Boom Defence Depots at Sheernessand Queenborough to be closed by 1960.Royal Naval Armament Depots:Royal Naval Torpedo Depot, Chatham, and Chatham GunwharfWorkshops to be closed by end of 1958.The Depots at TJpnor, Lodge Hill and Grain; and Chatham GunwharfStorehouses to be closed by 1963Other minor Fleet establishments and services at Chatham and Sheernesswill also be closed, reduced or transferred as the run-down of the Commandprogresses.7. In the Chatham and Sheerness area as a whole, the total number ofindustrial and non-industrial employees will be reduced by normal wastage anddischarge by about 2,700 over the next three years or so.Portland Dockyard and Underwater Research and Development Concentration8. Portland Dockyard will be run-down by July, 1959. A naval base will beretained there in support of the local establishments and H.M. Ships using the harbour.9. In addition, as has already been announced, research and development establishments, dealing with underwater weapons are to be concentrated there.This is essential in order to provide for the day-to-day working association of scientists in this important field, and to promote the closest possible integration ofthe techniques of detection and control in underwater weapons. The final stage of the concentration has been considered with particular care; but it has beendecided that there is no alternative to the transfer to Portland of the TorpedoExperimental Establishment, Greenock, if the most efficient scientific and technical co-ordination is to be achieved. The plans for the concentration are summarised below. The major part of it will be carried out during the first quarter of 1959;the Torpedo Experimental Establishment will not leave Greenock until towardsthe end of 1959.Underwater Detection Establishment, PortlandTo remain.     ;Admiralty Gunnery Establishment, PortlandTo be transferred to Portsdown, near Portsmouth, beginning early in 1959.Torpedo Experimental Establishment, GreenockTo be transferred to Portland towards the end of 1959.Royal Naval Torpedo Depot, WeymouthTo be closed towards the end of 1959 as a torpedo depot; to coincide withthe transfer of the Torpedo Experimental Establishment, for which its .staff and facilities will be available.Underwater Countermeasures and Weapons Establishment, HavantTo be transferred to Portland, beginning early in 1959.Underwater Launching Establishment, West Howe, BournemouthTo be transferred to Portland by mid-1959.10. The final effects of this reorganisation on civilian employment at Portlandcannot be precisely assessed. The Dockyard employs some 1,600 industrial and non-industrial staff. Most established men will Continue in employment in thearea; but some 200-300 men, including apprentices, will be offered transfer to admirality work elsewhere, and about 700 unestablished employees will be graduallyreduced by normal wastage and discharge. Some of the latter may be re-employedin the research and development concentration. At the Torpedo ExperimentalEstablishment, Greenock, where about 750 staff are employed, about 300
unestablished employees will have to be discharged. All established staff will beinvited to transfer to other establishments where suitable vacancies exist, includingthe Royal Naval Torpedo Factory, Alexandria.Home Air Command11. The tasks of the Home Air Command will be concentrated in largergroups at fewer bases. Six air establishments will be closed over the next threeyears, in addition to the air stations at Anthorn and Stretton, which are alreadyclosing. They are the Royal Naval Aircraft Yard, Donibristle; the Royal naval air Stations Ford, Bramcote and Eglinton; the Royal Naval Air Station Brawdy(which will be kept in reserve); and the Air Electrical Training Establishment atWorthy Down.12. The Aircraft Repair Yard at Donibristle, which is unsuitable for thelatest types of aircraft, will be closed by the end of 1959. It is hoped to dispose of it to industrial or commercial interests. It employs about 1,400 industrial and non-industrial staff. As many established men as possible will be absorbed intoRosyth Dockyard. The 700 or so unestablished employees will have to be reducedby normal wastage or discharge. Some 900 unestablished employees will be similarly affected at the other five air establishments, from which established men will be offered transfer elsewhere.   Planned dates or closure are as follows:  Royal Naval Air Station Ford, Sussex;Royal Naval Air Station Bramcote, Warwickshire:To be closed in late 1958 or early 1959.Royal Naval Air Station Eglinton, Co. Derry:To be closed in first half of 1959.Royal Naval Air Station Brawdy, Pembrokeshire:To be closed in 1960 (but to be kept in reserve).Royal Naval Air Electrical Tleaning Establishment, Worthy Down, nearWinchester :To be closed in 1961 its task to be transferred to Royal Naval Air Station,Lee-cn-Solent.13.   The air establishments to be retained are:  Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton.Royal Naval Air Station Lossiemouth.Royal Naval Air Station Culdrose.Royal Naval Air Station Abbotsinch.Royal Naval Air Station Arbroath.Royal Naval Air Station Lee-on-Solent.Royal Naval Aircraft Yard Belfast.Royal Naval Aircraft Yard Fleetlands.A small part of the Home Air Command task will be accommodated atRoyal Naval Air Station Halfar (Malta).Other Measures of Reorganisation and Reduction14. Decisions have also been taken to effect many smaller reductions andother measures of economical reorganisation, of which some have already been announced. In Germany the Elbe Squadron has been withdrawn and the RhineSquadron will shortly follow. The small craft which support the Fleet and shoreestablishments at all the major ports are being amalgamated into a single PortAuxiliary Service. Further reductions have been made in storage depots; inparticular, a number of smaller armament depots are to close. These closures havebeen made public except for that of the Royal Naval Armament Depot,Charlesfield, which will be run-down by the end of 1959. Training establishments
are being reduced to conform with the training requirements of a smaller Vote A.The savings in civilian posts resulting from these decisions are, so far as possible,being achieved through the process of normal wastage.15. In addition, savings are being made in Ceylon. Following an agreementwith the Ceylon Government in April 1957, the Naval Base at Trincomalee hasbeen transferred to the Royal Ceylon Navy, and other naval facilities (except theRoyal Naval wireless station) are being evacuated by the end of September 1958.Summary16. It is recognised that these measures will create disturbance and difficulties for both civilian and naval personnel. Everything possible will be done to mitigatehardship for all who are affected, and in particular to help civilian employeesdischarged to find other work. The Ministry of Labour and National Service willbe arranging, as necessary, to open special employment offices inside the establishments affected before discharges begin.17. The ultimate annual savings which will result cannot be accuratelyforecast. It is expected to achieve the following results, although the full effect ofsome of them will not be realised for about 4 years:  Major Reorganisation and Reductions (paragraphs 4-13):A saving of about 7,200 civilian posts; of about 2,700 naval posts ashore;and of about  7,000,000 a year.l^tvjiC ^uiiiniaiiu,Home Air Command;Sheerness Dockyard;Portland Dockyard; andR. and D. Concentration.Other Measures of Reorganisation and Reductions (paragraph 14):A saving of about 5,800 civilian posts; of about 3,500 naval posts ashore;and of about  5,000,000 a year.Overseas Dockyards and Bases (paragraphs 3 and 15):A saving of about 10,000 civilian posts; of about 450 naval posts ashore;and about  3,500,000 a year.Hong Kong;Trincomalee.18. These eventual savings total about 23,000 civilian posts at home andabroad, between 6,000 and 7,000 naval posts ashore, and about  15,500,000 ayear. They will make available more men to serve at sea; and more of our resources will be released for the paramount purpose of maintaining the strengthof the sea-going Fleet.
