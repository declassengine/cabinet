secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1958C. (58) 31 Copy No.31st January, 1958CABINETBRITISH EUROPEAN AIRWAYSMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation on 24th January the Cabinet invited me, in consultation with the Minister ofSupply, to circulate a further memorandum on the need of British european airways (B.E.A.) for new jet aircraft when the outcome of the current negotiations between the Hawker/Bristol consortium and Pan American Airways was known.(C.C. (58) 9th Conclusions, Minute 3.)2. I am circulating the present memorandum now because I do not believethat a settlement of this issue can be delayed any further. The announcement by de Havilland that Pan American Airways is going to open discussions withthem has changed the situation. Whatever interest Pan American Airways may show in the proposition being put before them by the Hawker/Bristol team, it is hardly likely that any firm order will be given without considerable technicalappraisement not only of their project, but also of the de Havilland design all ofwhich is bound to take an appreciable time.3. I must also tell my colleagues that, whatever may be the results of the hawker/Bristol sales effort, I am quite clear that I have no power to requireB.E.A. to take the Hawker/Bristol project against the Corporation^ own wishes.Nor, if I had the power, would I wish to do so. Whatever might go wrong withthe project during development, whether delay in delivery or technical difficultyor misadventure of any kind whatever, would be attributed by B.E.A. and by outside critics as my fault and that of the Government who had forced theCorporation to take an aircraft not of its own choosing. My colleagues will be aware of the strong feeling expressed on both sides of the House during the debate on civil aviation on 27th January, that the Government should not interfere inB.E.A.&apos;s choice of aircraft. If as a result of any American negotiation B.E.A.or de Havilland want to change their own minds then that is another matter.4. So far as I am concerned, therefore, I cannot refuse to allow B.E.A. toplace its order where it wants. I have gone as far as I can to help the Minister ofSupply with his plans for the future of the aircraft industry. To go further wouldmake me a party to the principle that, in connection with this order, which isbeing placed by the Corporation and not by the Government, B.E.A. can, in afashion which they believe to be contrary to their own best interests and to their statutory duty, be used as an instrument of Government policy for bringing abouta reorganisation of the aircraft industry. (5. It will also I believe place the Government in an extremely difficult position if we try to choose the aircraft rather than allow the customer to do so.Both groups are offering their aircraft as genuine private ventures. Both are going into the export field. I have no reason to suppose that, if B.E.A. place their order with the de Havilland group, there will be any real risk of the project notbeing successfully carried through. B.E.A.&apos;s auditors have confirmed this inconsultation with those of de Havilland. I do not see therefore on what groundswe can base a refusal to allow B.E.A. to exercise its technical judgment.52939SECRET

6. I have now examined the latest proposals for the formation of thede Havilland group. They may well have been slow to come to this decisionbut they have now come forward with a logical proposal for the formation of anew Company, probably to be called the Aircraft Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (to be known as air co-operation ), in &quot;which de Havilland would hold 67Jf per cent., HuntingAircraft 22-1 Per cent- ar*d Fairey Aviation 10 per cent., with technical participationby Handley Page Aircraft Ltd. who would contribute their experience of high-speedmilitary aircraft construction; Rolls Royce would provide and finance the entirepower plant. The net capital assets of the group would be  374- millions and theyshould find no difficulty in providing the capital needed for the project. Theauditors say that de Havilland should be able to finance the additional expenditure&apos;which a contract for the supply of twenty-four B.E.A. jet airliners would involveand, if additional contracts are obtained, there should be no difficulty in arranging the further finance required. In arriving at this conclusion, they have taken no account of the Hunting and Fairey interests. The de Havilland group should alsobe fully capable of selling the aircraft overseas for it is at least arguable thatde Havilland have more experience in oversea markets than either Hawker orBristol.7. B.E.A., as already indicated in C. (58) 19 of 23rd January, 1958, havefinally decided in favour of the de Havilland project. I list their reasons in theappendix.8. To sum up, the Corporation have no views against the sharing ofproduction between different firms but they are insistent, and I think rightly so,that the project shall be the responsibility of a single design team and, for thereasons listed, they want that design team to be de Havilland&apos;s. This is not a personal decision of Lord Douglas; it is strongly supported by the board and inparticular by his Vice-Chairman, Sir John Keeling (who is Chairman of some important industrial and financial companies and a director of others) who is confident of the financial soundness of the de Havilland group but much lessconfident as regards the Hawker/Bristol group if only because of their substantialunfunded borrowings.In view of the prospect of talks between de Havilland and Pan american airways, I see no advantage to any of the parties least of all to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in delaying an announcement any further. A decision now is a success for the Government and one that will be generally welcomed. We havealready allowed the Hawker/Bristol team time for preliminary exploration of sales prospects and they will not be able to complain that their efforts have beenprejudiced by the award of the contract to another group. Indeed, the negotiatingteam itself has asked only that a decision should be deferred to 31st January. to delay any further will undoubtedly produce a public conflict between theGovernment and the B.E.A. board and will lose us the credit of assisting thecreation of this new type of aircraft.9. For the reasons I have given in this memorandum, I seek my colleagues&apos;approval, whatever the results of the American sales talks may be, with eithercompany, to allow B.E.A. to place their order with the de Havilland group andfor me to announce this on Wednesday, February 5th, in reply to a Questionalready addressed to me.H. W.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1,31st January, 1958.
APPENDIXBritish European Airways: Reasons for Favouring the de Havilland Project1. de Havilland is the only British firm with previous experience of civiljet aircraft and the only firm in the world with a complete range of practical experience in this field.2. de Havillands have had extensive research experience with high-speedaircraft, and, under the proposed arrangement will be able to call upon HandleyPage who built the Victor bomber.3. The de Havilland project, the DH. 121, will be a natural successor to theComet, whereas the Bristol 200 would bear no relationship to the Britannia and very little relationship to the Avro Vulcan.4. de Havillands have a unique background of experience in the field of structural fatigue.5. de Havillands have an after-sale service which is better than that of anyother British firm except Vickers-Armstrongs.6. British Overseas Airways Corporation (B.O.A.C.), who have boughtaircraft from both firms, have found de Havillands a much more satisfactoryfirm to deal with than Bristols.7. de Havillands are accustomed to co-operating with Rolls-Royce, who willmanufacture the engine for the DH. 121, while Bristols have not worked withRolls-Royce since the war. Rolls-Royce have told B.E.A. that they would prefer to work with de Havillands and that they believe the DH. 121 stands the best chance of success.8. B.O.A.C., according to B.E.A., consider that de Havillands&apos; design workon systems, controls and installations as distinct from the overall design is betterthan that of Bristols.9. B.E.A. are already closely associated with de Havillands in connectionwith the Comet IVBs. and it would be advantageous if this co-operation could beextended.10. The success of the project must be dependent upon world sales;de Havillands are more likely to achieve this than the Bristol/Hawker Siddeleycombination.
