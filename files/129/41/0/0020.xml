THIS  document  is  the  property  of  his   britannic   majesty&apos;s   government       maPrinted for the Cabinet. July 1950CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.3 2CP. (50) 170llth July, 1950CABINETRATIFICATION OF INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONVENTIONS and acceptance OF RECOMMENDATIONS BY COUNTRIES OTHERTHAN THE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service as requested by the Cabinet on 1st May (CM. (50) 27th Conclusions,Minute 4), I circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a memorandum on theextent to which other countries have ratified Conventions and accepted Recom-mendations adopted at Sessions of the International Labour Conference.2. In dealing with the subject it is desirable to consider separately the twoforms of international regulation, Conventions and Recommendations, which theInternational Labour Conference uses for the promulgation of international labour standards. The different obligations under the Constitution of the InternationalLabour Organisation attaching to Conventions on the one hand and Recom-mendations on the other, to which I refer in the succeeding paragraphs, affectconsiderably the quantity of information which is available about the applicationof these two types of instrument in other countries. Much more is known aboutthe application of Conventions than about the application of Recommendations.International Labour Conventions3. States Members of the International Labour Organisation are obliged bythe Constitution to bring any Convention adopted by the Conference before thecompetent authority for the enactment of legislation or other action within amaximum period of 18 months from the closing date of the session of theConference at which the Convention was adopted and to inform the Director-General of the International Labour Office of the measures so taken. If the consentof the competent authority is obtained, the Member deposits an instrument of ratification of the Convention with the Director-General of the InternationalLabour Office. Complete information is, therefore, available in the InternationalLabour Office as to the extent to which States Members of the Organisation ratifyConventions. The International Labour Office notifies all States Members of newratifications as they are received and also presents to the International LabourConference each year a table showing the numbers of Conventions which havebeen ratified by States which are (or have at any time been) members of theOrganisation. The table submitted to the 33rd Session of the International LabourConference which took place at Geneva last month is annexed.4. States Members who ratify Conventions are obliged by the constitution to report annually to the International Labour Office on measures which they havetaken to give effect to the provisions of the Conventions which they have ratified.A summary of these reports is submitted to the Conference each year, togetherwith a report on them by a Committee of Experts on the Application of Conven-tions and Recommendations. The very detailed consideration given to the reports by the Committee of Experts and by the special Committee of the Conferenceappointed for the purpose, is, without doubt, a most effective method of keepingStates Members alive to their obligations. It is, however, true that the Committeeof Experts in its yearly reports habitually finds it necessary to draw attention to39034 B
a number of cases where there is an apparent lack of conformity between nationallegislation and the provisions of ratified Conventions. The report submitted bythe Committee of Experts to the 33rd Session of the Conference showed that, outof 666 reports examined, it was found necessary to make observations on 137.The significance of these figures should not, however, be over-estimated. A largenumber of the observations, made by the Committee were merely requests forfurther information in order to dispose of doubts, or requests for illustrativematerial in order to enable the Committee to obtain an adequate picture of theapplication of individual conventions. Even where the Committee of Experts have drawn attention to actual shortcomings, these more often than not refer to onlyone Article of a Convention containing a number of Articles. Nevertheless, it istrue to say that all countries do not carry out their international obligations onratified Conventions as scrupulously as they should. Particularly among certainLatin American countries, there is a tendency to look upon Conventions as theexpressions of high ideals and ratification as implying an intention to aspire and work towards those ideals. In such cases, it is sometimes the case that, whilelegislation is in conformity with ratified Conventions, the practical application ofthe legislation falls short of the obligations underaken.5. A word must be said about the special position of Federal States, since itwill be noted that the United States have only ratified five Conventions. This is because most of the subject matter of International Labour Conventions is not appropriate for Federal action but is reserved to the individual States of the Union.Article 19 (7) of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, whichwas designed to meet the special needs of Federal States, provides that, in the caseof Conventions and Recommendations which are not regarded as appropriate forfederal action, the obligations of the Federal Government are limited to the refer-ence of the Conventions and Recommendations to the appropriate State authorities;the arrangement of periodical consultations between the federal and State authori-ties with a view to promoting co-ordinated action to give effect to them; and the submission of reports to the Director-General of the International Labour office as requested by the Governing Body on the extent to which effect is being given,or is proposed to be given, to them.6. The fact that a country does not ratify a particular Convention is not proof that the provisions of the Convention are entirely inoperative in that country.The ratification of a Convention obliges the ratifying country to give effect to anumber of specific provisions and there are, no doubt, cases where countries areunable to ratify because they are unable to give effect to one of a set of provisions,the rest of which are already being applied. There are also countries which, for one reason or another, are not able to apply immediately the provisions of Conventionswhich they intend ultimately to ratify.7. These considerations suggest that the list of Conventions which have been ratified gives an unduly unfavourable picture of the effects of Conventions on thesocial policies of States Members of the Organisation. There is, however, atpresent no adequate information about the extent of the influence that InternationalLabour Conventions have had on countries which have not ratified them. a procedure is embodied in the Consitution whereby reports are rendered to theInternational Labour Office by States Members on Conventions unratified by themwhen asked by the Governing Body of the International Labour Office. This pro-cedure only came into force in 1948, and while it is hoped that it will ultimatelymake available much valuable information about the influence of the standardsset by the Organisation and about the difficulties which prevent or delay the ratifi-cation of Conventions, it is too early as yet to formulate any general conclusions on the basis of the information at present available.8. The earlier Conventions adopted by the International Labour Conferencehave secured many more ratifications on average than the more recent ones. this fact has greatly exercised the minds of many of those who have the welfare of theOrganisation most at heart and a number of possible reasons have been advanced in explanation of what is sometimes described inaccurately as a dangerous slacken-ing in the progress of ratification. In fact it is accounted for very largely by thenatural time lag in the process of ratification; it is not surprising that the earlystandards set by the organisation and aimed at the more obvious social evils should,through time, acquire an increasing number of adherents to whom the newer, more advanced standards covering a widening field are as yet out of reach.   At the same
time, it must be admitted that the ratification position is not wholly satisfactory.Quite apart from the need to secure as wide acceptance as possible of the standardsset by the Organisation, considerations which affect the very life of the Organisationare involved in this question. A really serious decline in the ratification of Con-ventions would strike at the foundations on which the Organisation was built. Itis against this background that the efforts of countries like the United Kingdom to ratify and give practical application to as many Conventions as possible should be viewed. The moral effect of these efforts on other members of the organisation is-undoubtedly considerable, and there is, I am sure, everything to be said for theircontinuance. At the same time, the United Kingdom Government has alwaysstriven, and will continue to strive, to secure that Conventions are fully realisticand capable of securing a wide measure of agreement and implementation.International Labour recommendations. Very little information is available about the extent to which othercountries generally adopt the standards laid down in Recommendations. As inthe case of Conventions, Members are obliged to bring them before the competent authority for the enactment of legislation or other action, but there is no provisionfor the acceptance of legal obligations by the ratification of Recommendations.The only obligation apart from presentation to the competent authority is to reporton the position of the national law and practice in relation to the matters dealt within the Recommendation as requested by the Governing Body. This reportingprocedure is parallel with that relating to unratified Conventions which has alreadybeen described and which also came into force in 1948. It is too early to attemptto draw general conclusions from these first reports on Recommendations as it is from those on unratified Conventions, and for the same reasons. When, however,the Organisation has had more experience of the new reporting procedure, I believe it will become easier to form a mere comprehensive and useful impression of the bearing which Recommendations have had on social policies and conditionsthroughout the world.G.
