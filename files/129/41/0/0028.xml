/   1*his DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO, d 6CABINETPERMANENT ECONOMIC powers memorandum by the Lord President of the council the principal war-time powers over the economic life of thecommunity were continued in force by the Supplies and Services(Transitional Powers) Act, 1945;   and, although some of these powers(notably exchange control) have been placed on a permanent basis, mostof them are due to expire on 10th December, 1950.     The Cabinet agreed on 10th July that Addresses should be moved in both Houses at the end ofthe present session continuing the various emergency powers in force for another year, since the powers can only be continued after 10th december next on a year-to-year basis (CM.(50) 44th Conclusions, Minute 3).     Thisis necessary as an interim measure but it is clearly an unsatisfactorybasis for the powers which are required indefinitely.     Accordingly, theCabinet, at their meeting on 30th March last (C.M.(50) 1 6th Conclusions,Minute 3) asked the Lord Presidents Committee to examine the legalform in which essential economic controls should be continued in force on a long-term basis, and agreed to discuss at a later date the questionwhether permanent legislation of this kind could appropriately be intro-duced in the present Parliament or should be deferred to a new Parliament.2. I attach the draft of an Economic Planning and Full employment bill which was prepared by officials under the aegis of the Lord presidents committee and which, subject to certain amendments which have been incorporated in the present draft of the Bill, was approved in principle bythe Lord Presidents Committee on 31st July,     The draft covers botheconomic controls and price regulation;   and it seemed to the Committeeconvenient to deal with both subjects in the one measure.3. The Bill in effect makes permanent the wide powers conferred on ministers by Defence Regulation 55 and various other emergency measures.In form, the powers are negative in character, that is to say they enable ministers to prohibit economic activities or to say that, if economicactivities are pursued, they must be subject to certain conditions.     Thesenegative powers can be used, and are used, to direct economic activitiesinto channels which the Government regard as desirable;   but in form theydo not provide for the purposive direction of industry and commerce.     Imention this, because I do not wish any of my colleagues to be under themisapprehension that we are taking direct powers to require industrialiststo engage in activities against their will.     Under the Bill in its present form, we can tell them what they must not do, we can impose conditions on what they do, but we cannot order them to do something they do not want to do.     There is of course much to be said for the purposive direc-tion of industry and commerce, and we can discuss ways in which some more positive powers could be imported into the Bill.     It seems likely,SECRETCP.(50) 17825TH JULY, 1950

however, that any positive control of industry would require an approachfundamentally different - both as regards the powers over industry and commerce sought and the sanctions necessary for their support - fromthat of the controls which survive from the Emergency Powers (Defence)Act and analogous legislation.4. The wide powers in the Bill are absolutely essential for theeconomic policies which we are pursuing;   but, owing to the negativecharacter of the powers, it is not easy to bring this home in the terms ofthe Bill itself.     The Lord Presidents Committee accordingly asked that consideration should be given to the drafting of a suitable preamble tothe Bill, drawing attention to the need for economic planning in order tosecure full employment and the general weli-being of the country.     Apreamble has been inserted in the Bill for consideration.     It involvessome overlapping with the wording of clause 1, but this is not an insuperable-able objection.5. The Bill does not deal with import and export licensing, sincelegislation on that subject has to be timed with regard to the duration ofa number of temporary Acts and the ratification of the Havana Charter.Nor does the Bill deal with the trading powers of the Ministry of Supply,which are being examined separately.6. I should perhaps draw the attention of my colleagues to someprocedural points.(a) The Bill provides that statutory instruments made under itshall be subject to negative, not affirmative, resolutions of both Houses;and, in order to meet possible Parliamentary criticism, it provides that ministers exercising powers under the Bill should make an annual reportto Parliament.(b) The Bill continues in force indefinitely the large number ofexisting orders under the Supplies and Services (Emergency Powers)Act, 1945, and other emergency legislation.     On administrative groundsthis is desirable, but it will be criticised as continuing war-time andtransitional measures under the cloak of a permanent measure.     Thealternative would be to require Departments to re-enact such existingorders as they still need within a specified period after the passing of thenew Bill.(c)     The Lord Presidenfs Committee were of opinion that the Billshould be permanent in form and should not be restricted to a number ofyears.7. If the Cabinet give general approval to the Bill, it will benecessary to discuss its provisions with the Government of NorthernIreland.     It is very desirable that the Bill should apply to NorthernIreland, particularly as respects United Kingdom Departments operatingthere;   but the subject is one on which the Parliament of Northern ireland has power to legislate for itself.8. The purpose of bringing the draft of the Bill before the Cabinet atthis stage is to enable a decision in principle to be taken whether the Billshould be proceeded with, and whether it should be introduced next Sessionor kept back for introduction in a new Parliament.     It is not contemplated that the Cabinet should at this stage approve the Bill in detail, and accord-ingly the Ministers concerned will have further opportunities of makingadditions or alterations in its provisions.Council Office, S.W.1, H.M.25TH JULY, 1950. -Z-
