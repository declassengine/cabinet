Printed for the Cabinet.   July 1950.secret copy No.32CP. (50) 1671th July, 1950.CABINETSUPPLEMENTARY PENSIONS IN THE SOCIALISED INDUSTRIESTogether with the other Ministers concerned, I shall be meeting representativesof the Trades Union Congress on 17th July for a further discussion about supple-mentary pensions for manual workers in the socialised industries. We do not know what line the T.U.C. representatives will be taking on this occasion, but we mustbe prepared for the possibility that they will say that the T.U.C. can no longerrestrain the individual unions from pressing their claims for extended supple-mentary pensions. I think, therefore, that before the meeting I should report tothe Cabinet on the previous discussions, and consult them about the attitude whichwe should adopt on this occasion.2. The present position as far as supplementary pensions in the socialised industries are concerned is complicated, and there are many anomalies. A review which was made last year showed that out of very roughly 1,650,000 manual workers in the socialised industries, about 370,000 were covered by pensionarrangements of one sort or another, including ex gratia provision under customarypractice outside actual pension schemes. The proportions covered ranged from14 per cent, in coal and 16 per cent, in transport, to 67 per cent, and 70 per cent,in electricity and gas: in civil aviation the percentage was 50 per cent., but theschemes were open to manual workers, and the aim was virtually complete cover-age. The provision varied from discretionary pensions of a few shillings a week to local government terms with pensions up to two thirds of retiring pay, and agood many of the schemes which had been inherited from the previous manage-ments were actuarially unsound. The taking over of iron and steel will addconsiderably to the numbers employed in the socialised industries, and few ofthe iron and steel workers have superannuation rights at present.3. The T.U.C. have drawn attention to the anomalies which are created by a situation in which workers enjoying superannuation rights work in a publicundertaking alongside comparable workers who do not enjoy them. They haveargued that there should be consistency of treatment between manual and salariedworkers, and have referred to the introduction of new schemes for manual workersin private industry, without any attempt by the Government to stop this happening.They have also urged that the Government should stand on one side and leavethe question of supplementary pensions to be freely negotiated between the boards and the trade unions, like wages and other conditions of employment.4. We, on the other hand, have explained that in the socialised industriessupplementary pensions are on a different footing from wages and other condi-tions because of the statutory provisions requiring Ministerial approval of pensions schemes made by the Boards. There was no objection to the trade unions dis-cussing the matter with the Boards, but it would be wrong for the Government toallow the Boards to enter into such discussions in ignorance of their policy. Todo so would embarrass the Boards and lead to disappointment for the unions. TheGovernment did not feel that they could take the responsibility of allowing negotia-tions to proceed without making it clear that they would not be prepared to approve the extension of supplementary pensions schemes at present.5. We took this line with the concurrence of the Prime Minister and the full support of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the other members of the Sociali-sation of Industries Committee:   The following are the main arguments whichMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council38996THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OF  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   6QVEBNMEHT
influenced the committee and which we developed in the discussions with theT.U.C.:- &apos; , ,\(i) To the extent that the Boards are expected to contribute -and the unionstake it for granted that they will contribute half if not more of the cost -... , the costs of the industries will be substantially increased at a time whenit is most important that their costs should be brought down, and their prices at any rate prevented from rising. It is also important not to add to the difficulties which the socialised industries are experiencing at thisearly stage in their history. If everybody was ultimately to be brought up to the level of the workers at present receiving the most favourable treatment (e.gH with a maximum pension of two-thirds of retiring pay as under local authority schemes) and the cost was shared between the boards and the .employees, the additional burden to the Boards was estimated by the Government Actuary&apos;s Department to be of the orderof  27 million a year;  27 million a year would also of course have tobe contributed by the workers.(ii) The socialised industries must be considered as a whole.   There would beno stopping short of comprehensive supplementary pensions schemes in them all. The grant of supplementary pensions to one grade would leadto the same treatment for other grades. If one section of an industry were covered, it would be impossible to resist demands from other sections; in transport, for example, there could not be a scheme for railway workers, but none for those employed in commercial road transport. Nor would it be possible to distinguish between the different industries; the miners, would hardly acquiesce in a state of affairs inwhich there were comprehensive pensions schemes in gas and electricitybut not in coal.(iii) There would also be far-reaching repercussions throughout private industry.   There would be irresistible demands that the example set by the socialised industries should be followed, and the costs of British.  . industry generally would go up.(iv) Only as recently as 1948, a major step forward was made when the national insurance scheme came into operation. Not only did this extend- to everybody, but it substantially improved the existing pensions, andits cost to the community will grow steeply. The Act provides for a comprehensive review of the operation of the scheme during the period to March 1954, and the trade unions would be best advised to defer their claims for supplementary pensions until this review has taken place.(v) Additional pension provision is an alternative to improvements in wagesand other conditions of employment. The danger is, however, that thereduction in the pay packet due to the worker&apos;s own contribution mightactually stimulate wage demands, with the result of adding further to the costs of the industries.(vi) It is doubtful whether most of the workers, especially the younger and lower-paid among them, would be prepared to pay the additional con-tributions over and above their national insurance contributions whichwould be necessitated by any worth-while scheme. A scheme bringingeverybody up to the most favourable existing provision would involveadditional contributions of the order of 6\ per cent, of wages(nearly Is. Ad. in the  ) on the supposition that the workers contributedhalf the cost. A more modest scheme, if the benefits were not to ber      ;   :, insubstantial, would still involve relatively heavy deductions from pay.6. The T.U.C. have been most co-operative, and they have succeededhitherto in damping down the pressure from the unions, but they are finding thisincreasingly difficult. I appreciate the delicacy of their position especially if, asthey may tell us, the stage has been reached when any guidance which they givewill be disregarded by important unions concerned with the socialised industries.7. I am, however, quite clear that, as the Socialisation of Industries Com-mittee have agreed, the extension of supplementary pensions schemes for manual workers in the socialised industries would be contrary to the national interest atpresent. It is also clear that in view of their statutory responsibilities Ministerscannot leave the matter to the Boards.8. If the policy of restraint can no longer be maintained, the consequence islikely to be heavy pressure from the unions upon both Ministers and Boards   We
should not underestimate the strength of the feeling which appears to exist, par-ticularly among the miners and the railwaymen. It may not be easy to persuade the rank and file, especially the older men, that the grant of supplementary pensions in present conditions will not further their long-term interests. The idea has greatsuperficial attractions. The average man will not so readily understand that inthe long run the cost will come out of his own pocket because it will have to bemet by increased prices and the deferment of other improvements as well as by hisown weekly contributions.9. We must be prepared to hold our ground, but the Cabinet should be aware that the Policy Committee of the Labour Party recently instructed the research department to approach the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofNational Insurance with a tentative proposal that an inquiry should be undertaken on the possibility of merging and extending existing superannuation schemes.After a preliminary survey, the Research Department have suggested that anyinquiry should report in particular on:  &quot; (1) The management and soundness of the schemes.(2) Possibilities of co-ordination, bearing in mind the need for standardisationas far as possible in order that a system of transfer values may be devised whereby the employees of one firm may take up employmentwith another without loss of pension rights.(3) The extension of superannuation schemes,  possibly on a national basis through payment of additional weekly national insurance contributions.&quot;10. There would be obvious tactical advantages in being able to tell the tradeunions concerned with the socialised industries that we had decided to institute an inquiry into supplementary pensions schemes generally, and that any claims forextended supplementary pensions should be deferred until the inquiry was com-pleted. That would not in itself be a sufficient reason for having an inquiry, but itseems to me that there is much merit in the proposal on other grounds. Experiencehere and in the United States suggests that we must expect the practice of providingsupplementary pensions for manual workers to grow, and important issues ofeconomic policy would be raised by any wide extension of the provision for old age, particularly at a time when the expectation of life is increasing and the elderlyare coming to form an ever greater proportion of the population. It is desirablethat supplementary pensions schemes should develop on lines which are most advantageous to the participants and to the community at large, and that theyshould not be embarked upon without, full knowledge of their wider implications.Safeguards may be necessary against the institution of schemes which are actuariallyunsound and whose eventual breakdown may cause serious hardship to those whoare relying upon them for additional provision in their old age. There is a strong case for considering what should and can be done to make it easier for workers who change their employment to preserve their pension rights.11. If the Cabinet should decide in principle that there should be an inquiry,careful consideration would have to be given to its composition and terms ofreference of the body which conducted it. In particular it would be necessary tomake it clear that the job of the committee was not only to examine the existing provision for supplementary pensions and the lines on which further supple-mentary schemes might best be developed (including the allocation of the cost) butalso the the economc implications of any wide extension of such schemes. The termsof reference should also leave no doubt that, while the committee could considersupplementary pensions in relation to the provision under the National InsuranceAct, it would not be open to them to recommend how the national insurancescheme might be widened with further assistance from the Exchequer.12. Should the Cabinet decide in favour of an inquiry, I should like authorityto tell the representatives of the T.U.C. privately if this seemed desirable in the light of the discussion that this is our intention, and to ask them to exerttheir influence to prevent the trade unions from pressing claims for supplementary pensions pending its completion.H.
