HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(50) 1994TH SEPTEMBER, 1950COPY NO.3%-CABINETCONTROL OF GERMAN industry memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe United States Delegation to the Three-Power Study group on Germany have proposed that, at the forthcoming meeting in New Yorkthe Foreign Ministers should instruct the Group in the next stage of its work to review the provisions of the Prohibited and Limited IndustriesAgreement.    The objects of the review would be:-(a) to eliminate those restrictions which are no longer necessary from a security point of view, or which have been foundadministratively impracticable;(b) to enable some flexibility- to be introduced into theremaining restrictions, so that German industry can make a useful contribution (not in armaments, but in non-ordnanceitems) to the common defence programme.The text of a . United States paper on this subject is reproduced in the Annex to this paper.2. The United States Delegation have also indicated informally tothe United Kingdom Delegation their view that early and separate action may have to be taken to raise the level of Western German steel production,fixed by the Agreement at 11. 1 million tons per annum, and possibly ofother materials necessary for defence.    They have not suggested a figure for the revised level of production;   but they do not consider that theexisting overall steel capacity (about 15 million tons per annum) shouldbe increased.3. In a paper which I recently circulated to the Defence Committee(D. O. (50) 68:   Demolition of Buildings and Installations in Germany)I expressed the view that Western Germany should no longer be regarded asa threat to the security of the Western Powers and that the role of potentialaggressor had devolved upon the Soviet Union.   In these circumstances think that we should welcome the opportunity to re-examine and revisean Agreement which was based on a conception of the relationship betweenThe Group was set up by the Foreign Ministers of the occupying powers at their meeting in London in May, 1950, and instructed tosubmit to the Ministers at their meeting in New York inSeptember, a report on certain German questions.

German industry and security which is now outmoded, since anyrevisions agreed may enable German industry to be better utilised inthe common defence programme.   The Agreement, however, cannot be reviewed before 1952 without the concurrence of the French, andMr. Acheson and I would probably have to bring a good deal of pressure upon Lvl. Schuman before he would consent to the proposedreview or later to authorise any substantial changes in the Agreementitself.   These considerations make it, in my view, the more necessarythat I should, if possible, be in a position to associate myself ingeneral terms with the United States proposal.4. But to join with the Americans in drafting these recommendations would mean accepting certain implications of which my colleagues should be aware.   A revision of the Prohibited and Limited IndustriesAgreement in the light of our present ideas of security could hardly fail to lead to the relaxation of a number of restrictions.   In the sphere of shipbuilding, for instance, it would be difficult under the pressure of facts and of American insistence to retain the existinglimitations on speed and tonnage, although there would no doubt beopportunity to consult my colleagues again before agreeing to any increase in shipbuilding capacity.5. If Germany is to supply &quot;non-ordnance&quot; goods to the West,but largely escape the fiscal and industrial burden of rearmament,then, while we are arming, Germany will be building up her financial strength and penetrating our markets.   It may be that the costs of continuing occupation - about five per cent of the national income of the Federal Republic - could be regarded as a German contributionto defence, but this may not be enough.   I think this problem willrequire very careful consideration.   But the existence of the problem would not, in my view, justify a refusal to revise the Prohibited and limited Industries Agreement, though before such revisions take effect it will no doubt be necessary to give further consideration tothe problem of how the burden of the cost of defence as between germany and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation Powers can, asfar as possible, be equalized.6. These latter considerations apply with particular force tothe United States proposal that pending the completion of the revision ofthe Agreement the High Commission should be given discretion to take such action as may be needed with respect to the production of steel and other materials necessary for defence (paragraph 6 of the UnitedStates paper).   In the first place it seems to me that discretion cannotbe given to the High Commission in this matter to act on its own initiative.   It would be necessary that it should act only upon the advice of the competent inter-allied body - presumably the North atlantic treaty Organisation - which would indicate the particular shortages which german industry might fill.    But apart from this I would feel somereluctance in accepting the American proposal without indicating to themthat we feel that there will before long be need to clarify thefinancial basis on which Germany will contribute to the common defence programme.   I understand that this question, but only as regards N.A.T.O.Powers, is under separate study.   As regards steel in particular, I realise that the Minister of Supply is anxious that a raising of the steel levelmight further reduce the scrap supplies available for our own steelindustry from Germany.   I have taken up the question of our scrapneeds for defence purposes separately with Mr. Acheson, and am

proposing to discuss the matter with him in New York, but I am convinced that it would be inadvisable to try to strike a direct bargainover the steel level and our own scrap supplies.recommendations. I seek the authority of my colleagues:-(a)   to associate myself with the proposal in paragraph 4of the United States paper that a study of the Prohibitedand Limited Industries Agreement should be undertakenimmediately with a view to its revision in accordancewith the principles indicated in the United States proposal;(b) that I should inform Mr. Acheson that while I recognise that pending the completion of this review it may be necessary tomake certain relaxations in advance regarding the productionof steel and other materials necessary for defence,I consider that in general such relaxations should only bemade upon the proposal of the competent international body;(c) that I should be empowered to agree forthwith and as an interim measure to a moderate increase in the permitted productionlevel for steel, if Mr. Acheson attaches particular importanceto this from the point of view of the United States defence programme.E.

THIS   DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTYS  GOVERNMENTSECRET Copy No.    32ANNEXInter-Governmental Study Group on GermanyRevision of Prohibited and Limited Industries Agreement(Position of United States Delegation)1. The nations of the West are agreed in the necessity for strengthening thecommon defence as rapidly as possible. They likewise recognise that the produc-tion of defence equipment will place a heavy burden on their respective economies.Moreover, the impact of this burden will be particularly severe at the present timewhen industrial production in the West is already operating at near capacity.Shortages will undoubtedly ensue as, in fact, they already have in the United states in critical sectors such as steel. These shortages may aggravate the existing inflation-tionary forces and make them more difficult to control.2. In view of the foregoing, it is essential that provision be made for the *utilisation of the industrial resources of Germany in support of the defence pro-gramme of Europe and of the Atlantic Community. The United States does not envisage that Germany would be authorised to fabricate ordnance items. On theother hand, it feels that Germany should be empowered to produce primary andother industrial commodities and articles which will be required in the defence effort. The most important of these commodities at the present time is steel, butthere are others also such as ball bearings, aluminium and chemicals. these commodities should either be made available for export from Germany for fabrica-tion in other Western countries into supplies required for the common defence, or,alternatively, might be fabricated within Germany into non-ordnance itemsnecessary for adequate defence, such as, for example, trucks.3. If we are to avail ourselves of the capacity of Germany to produce these commodities, without modification of the Prohibited and Limited Industries (P.L.I.)Agreement, the additional demands would be at the expense of her essentialdomestic requirements with consequent economic and political repercussions insideGermany. In general, the limitations in the Agreement were based vipon theassumption that the production of these items would cover the essential domesticrequirements of Germany.4. There are, of course, other considerations which bear upon the P.L.I.Agreement and which, in the view of the United States, reinforce the case for modification. In the circumstances and taking into account the present relations,and the anticipated closer relations between Germany and Western Europe, theUnited States proposed that the three Occupying Powers proceed immediately toa study of the P.L.I. Agreement with a view to its revision in accordance with thefollowing principles:  (a) The elimination of restrictions which have proved to be unduly burdensomein administration.(b) The elimination of restrictions which have proved to be excessive in termsof security requirements viewed within the framework of the presentrelations between Germany and tjie Occupying Powers.(c) The provision of flexibility in the Agreement to permit the use of theGerman industrial potential for the production on non-ordinance itemsrequired for the defence of the West.5. The three Governments will require advice and expert assistance from theHigh Commission to carry forward the revision of the Agreement in accordancewith the first two principles. Revision of the Agreement in pursuance of these threeprinciples should result in substantial changes in the present provisions affectingsteel, shipbuilding, in particular the production of ships for export, ball and rollerbearings, chemicals, synthetic ammonia and chlorine, and, also, certain controls inregard to machine tools and electronic valves, and possibly others.39299
6. Decision is required by the Foreign Ministers at their forthcoming meeting to authorise the High Commission to take such action as may be needed for theproduction of steel, and other materials necessary for defence, while detailed dis-cussions covering modifications of the Agreement itself are going forward.7. The revision of the P.L.I. Agreement should form part of the arrangements to be worked out with the Federal Government in connection with the relaxation of controls under the Occupation Statute.30th August, 1950.
