THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT I. S-so the circulation  of this paper has been strictly limited. 170It is issued for the personal use of    S\r X^fJWMMft   S)**W*V&quot;TOP SECRET Copy No. 3JitC.P.(50) 18131ST JULY, 1950CABINETDEFENCE REQUIREMENTS AND UNITED STATES assistance memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer we have been asked by the Americans to provide this weekinformation &quot;concerning the nature and extent of the increased effort,both as regards increases in forces and increases in military production,which His Majesty&apos;s Government as a North Atlantic Treaty Power are willing and able to undertake, as well as information concerning additionalmilitary production programmes which could be initiated with United States&apos;assistance&quot;.2i We have already approved an increased programme for activedefence expenditure of  00 millions, of which approximately  30 millionswill fall in 1950/51 and  70 millions in 1951/52.   We have further approved in principle a civil defence programme of  137 millions, which wouldapproximately cost  20 millions in 1951/52,  30 millions in 1952/53 and  40millions in 1953/54.    For the purpose of reckoning the additional expenditure which we are likely to be compelled to undertake in improving the pay and increasing the size of the armed forces during these years I suggestthat we make an allowance, without prejudice to detailed discussions, of afurther  100 millions, of which, say,  10 millions would fall in 1950/51 and 30 millions in each of the three following years.3. The Supply Departments have been asked to consider what additional expenditure upon armaments would be physically possible over and above these additions during the remainder of this year and the next threeyears.   Annex I summarises the replies that have been received and further details are given in Annex II.   These programmes have been compiled uponthe following assumptions: -(i)   no direction of labour;(ii)   no requisitioning of capacity and very little new building work ofany kind;(iii)   that we can obtain very large supplies of raw materials, machine tools, components and balancing items from the United States tothe value, all told, of  200 millions.   The bulk of the machine tools and some of the materials will be required at a very early date.

Therefore I propose thatwe should inform the United States Government that if desired we shouldbe willing to add this to the additional programme, but no account has beentaken of it in the remainder of this paper.5. Clearly it would be impossible for us to meet a rise in expenditureof this magnitude without assistance and I propose that in answering thesecond part of the United States question we should take the following line:-(i)   We are committed by decisions already taken or almost certain to betaken in the near future to a defence expenditure of about  820 millions in 1950/51 (an increase of  40 millions over the 1949/50 level)and  900 millions in 1951/52.(ii)   On general economic grounds we consider  950 millions is themaximum defence expenditure we can afford in 1951/52and in the two following years.    If we are to undertake the additional programme we should, therefore, ask for assistance to meet thedifference between the total cost of defence in these three years of  3 ,400 millions and  2,850 millions, i. e.   550 millions.-2-These programmes will, of course, place a heavy burden upon the economy,especially upon the engineering and chemical industries.    (The con-structional works and textiles elements are relatively small).   The totalman-power requirement is likely to mount up to 250,000 at mid-1952and will remain at that level over the period, but it is thought that this can bemet in the conditions assumed, provided that the necessary fiscal measures are taken, and reductions in investment made.4. The implications of an additional programme of this magnitudeto aggregate defence expenditure over the next three years are summarised in the following table:-  millions

This means that out of the additional programme of  810 millions we shallask for assistance to the extent of  550 millions and shall commit ourselves tobear the remainder of  266 millions.6. In support of this proposal we should deploy the following mainarguments:-(i)   The United States Government themselves recognise in the memorandumthey have addressed to us that the continuance of our economic recovery is &quot;essential, though possibly at a less rapid rate&quot;.We should emphasise that we can only be a useful ally if we maintain,despite the preoccupations of defence, to the maximum possible extent, our export trade and the re-equipment of our own industry. 950 millions a year is the maximum that we feel that we can spendon defence in the next three years consistently with this objective.(ii)  Our economy is fully extended now and recent reviews of the situationmade before the present crisis suggested that foreseeable increases in productivity were not more than sufficient to meet export demands on a rising scale, urgent demands for home and overseas investment and increased Government expenditure to which we are to some extentcommitted.   Consequently, military expenditure at the rate of  950millions a year, i. e.  -^tj millions more than the level we had until recently contemplated, will mean a very considerable sacrifice.7. It is very important that we should persuade the Americans that aidin respect of this additional programme should be in free dollars which weeither hold or use to make purchases in any part of the world, and not aid whichcan only be used for purchases made in dollars.   This is essential because this additional programme will inevitably restrict our engineering exports,and is, therefore, likely to increase our sterling liabilities.   We need to receiveaid in a form which enables us to raise our dollar reserves in order to offsetthese liabilities.8. We must, of course, make it clear to the United States that our offer is dependent on approval by Parliament.9. I propose that we should represent our additional production asintended to meet the needs of other North Atlantic Treaty Organisation forces as&apos;well as our own forces, and that in recognition of the new United state said, transfers of equipment should be made without payment between theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation countries.    This proposal would of courseapply to additional equipment produced by all North Atlantic Treaty Organisationcountries, not only to equipment produced by the United Kingdom.10. An approach on these lines to the United States will, if the aid we askfor is granted, commit us to a net defence expenditure at the rate of 950 millions a year in the three years in question subject, of course, to parliamentary authority.   I ask my colleagues to agree to this potentialcommitment.    We must, however, recognise that we will not be able to carry it out unless we are at the same time prepared to take the necessary financial and administrative steps to make possible the freeing of resources.This will entail either cuts in Government expenditure, additional taxation orreductions in investment or a combination of all three.11. Proposals were made by Departments that we should ask the americans, in reply to their present offer, to assist us by financing thestockpiling of a six months supply of oil, raw materials and some

essential foodstuffs.   The raw materials would not be required directly forthe additional production which can physically be achieved.   I therefore propose that we do not include any reference to this matter in our reply butthat we should raise it with the Americans at a later stage.12. If we agree to reply to the Americans on these lines I suggestthat the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations should informCommonwealth Governments of the American proposal to us and the broadcharacter of our proposed reply.R .S.C,Treasury Chambers, S.

ANNEX IIDETAILS OF THE PRODUCTION PROGRAMMEREFERRED TO IN PARAGRjlPH ^3QF THE PAPERAircraft (Naval and R.A.F.)1..It is estimated that, in addition to the extra aircraftprovided for in the  100 millions programme it should be possibleto produce in the three years approximately 5,000 more aircraft at a total cost, with spares, of  21+2 millions.   Outstandingexport orders, but no further export orders would be met.    SomeAmerican equipment and machine tools would have to be madeavailable by the necessary &apos;dates.2. This programme would involve a diversion of labour from,non-defence work of the order of 80,000 including sub-contractors.It would require  10 millions worth of materials from hard currency sources and would involve investment of the order of l4i millions for works services and machine tools.    On a preliminary estimate one-half of the latter ( 6 millions)would have to come from the U.S.A.    A further        millions worth of airborne radio equipment would also be required from theU.S.A.    Dollar materials and equipment of all kinds for this additional aircraft programme thus amount to about &amp;ffir millionsout of the total cost of  21+2 millions.Radio and Radar (excluding Military)3. Additional production of  10 millions could be achieved,but this would require some  2-g- millions worth of dollar plant and materials.    One consequence of the adoption of this programme^is that, in the view of the Air Ministry it will be necessary togo over entirely to U.H..F,  for technical reasons.    This meansreplacing equipment in existing aircraft with United States equip-ment we could not make, which Is not properly part of an expanded programme of United Kingdom production.    It is estimatedthat this would involve a straight bid for United States Radio,and Radar equipment costing  75 millions, not included in these programmes.Army and Common Service items. We should be able to tackle an additional production programme over the three years 1951/52 to 1953/54- of some 325 millions.    This would cover such items as weapons andequipment, ammunition, radio and military radar, vehicles,tanks, clothing,  engineering and general stores.    It would also include some machine tools from the home industry, but the bulkof these requirements would be met from the U.S.A..5.. Besides this extessential imports wouldmillions for raw matericarried out. This amoution programme. A furtspares, components andour own production, andGermany ( 7 millions) aonly from the U.S.A. orin dollars - is additiora production in the United Kingdom,certainbe required.    These will include  64als without which the programme cannot bent is included in the  325 millions produc-her  43 millions covers machine tools,even complete items essential to balanceobtainable except for clothing fromnd sandbags from India ( 2 millions),Canada.    This  43 millions -  34 millionsrial to the  325 millions..

Research and Development6. Existing programmes already envisage a fairly steep riseover the next three years, accentuated by the recent decision to speed up the development of guided weapons.   Further measuresdeemed practicable under an assisted programme would cost  27millions over the three years.    This would include equipmentsand services from the U.S.A. costing only &amp;z million,  such as ramjets, solid fuel, magnetrons and use of United States supersonicwind tunnels.Admiralty7. Major components of the Admiralty proposals over the threeyears are New Construction ( 30 millions), Contract Conversions( 10.5 millions), Armaments ( 19.5 millions) and armaments,ammunition, machine tools, equipment and naval aircraft from theUnited States which could not be made in this country ( 1+6.9millions), but which are required to balance our own production or make it possible.
