(49) 40th Conclusions, Minute 3), the cabinet approved a proposal by the then Minister of Fuel and Power that a Committeeshould be appointed to investigate the causes of the increase in involuntary absenteeism in the coalmining industry; and on 15th August, 1949, I appointed a Committee for this purpose under the Chairmanship of Sir David Lidbury, a former official of the Post Office.I now circulate, for the consideration of my colleagues, the report which hasbeen submitted to me by this Committee.C. R. A.10 Downing Street, SWA,1th July, 1950

On 13th August, 1949, the Prime Minister appointed us as a Committee withthe following terms of reference: &quot; To investigate the causes of the recent increasein involuntary absenteeism in the coalmining industry and to submit recommenda-tions for remedying it.&quot;The Committee was composed as follows:  Sir David Lidbury (Chairman)Sir Geoffrey King, Ministry of National InsuranceMr. D. C. Barnes, Ministry of LabourMiss E. M. R. Russell-Smith. Ministry of HealthMr. C. H. de Peyer, Ministry of Fuel and PowerAfter the 4th meeting, the place of Mr. D. C. Barnes was taken by Mr. J. G.Stewart, also of the Ministry of Labour.In addition the following took part in the work of the Committee as assessors:Sir Geoffrey Vickers, V.C., National Coal BoardMr. E. Chicken, National Coal BoardMr. A. L. Horner, National Union of MineworkersMr. R. F. Fowler of the Central Statistical Office was appointed as Secretary.2. Our first duty was clearly to establish the facts of the increase in involun-tary absenteeism, which the terms of reference stated had taken place, and tofind out whether any significant trends had established themselves.Definitions3. To start with, some explanation seems desirable of how the statistics ofabsenteeism in the coalmining industry are calculated. The number of wage earners in the industry refers to the number on the colliery books, including personswho have been absent for not more than six months through injury, sickness orother unexplained reasons, but excluding all persons who have been absent for more than six months. The number of shifts actually worked by these wage earners is recorded each week, and also the number lost through absenteeism (thatis, the number lost through all causes other than stoppages at the mine due todisputes, recognised holidays, breakdowns, &amp;c). The number of shifts possible is the sum of the shifts worked and the shifts lost, and the absenteeism percentageis the number lost expressed as a percentage of the total number of possible shifts.The figure of percentage absenteeism therefore reflects both the number of spellsof absence and the average duration of such spells and does not distinguish betweenthe two.4. A distinction is drawn between shifts voluntarily and involuntarily lost and the absenteeism percentage is divided similarly. The separation between shiftsvoluntarily and involuntarily lost is done by the appropriate official at the colliery.Generally speaking all absence is classified as voluntary unless a satisfactory ex-explanation is given by the man. The kinds of explanation which are accepted as satisfactory are more or less uniform throughout the country, but the evidence(if any) required to substantiate the explanations varies to some extent. There is,however^ no doubt that the changes shown by the national statistics are of definitesignificance.The Movement of Involuntary Absence5. With this explanation we may now pass on to actual figures, and a con-venient starting point is 1945, when involuntary absenteeism reached a peak of9-0 per cent. Table I of the Appendix shows the movement in involuntary absenteeism for each quarter from the beginning of 1945 to the first quarter of 1950.Table I is illustrated in Chart A. There was a steady fall from an average of 9 - 0 percent, in 1945 to an average of 7-6 in 1946 and to an average of 6-0 in 1947. Some-time during the second or third quarter of 1948 the downward trend changed to an upward trend and by the fourth quarter of 1948 involuntary absenteeism had risen to 6-2 per cent, compared with 5-0 per cent, in the fourth quarter of 1947.  The(x) Absences due to sickness and injuries are the main categories of involuntary absence, butabsences on Trade Union business and absence on compassionate grounds are also classed asinvoluntary.

rise continued in 1949, though there is evidence that it was slowing down in the last quarter of that year.6. Absenteeism in the years 1945 to 1949 was affected by a number of factors which prevent us from regarding any particular year as representative or normalEpidemics such as influenza vary in their intensity from year to year. The transition from war to peace was bound to be a gradual process and more or less profoundchanges were taking place during these years in conditions of employment, levelof earnings, the composition of the labour force of the industry and the outlook and morale of the industry. Particular reference should be made to nationalisation,which became effective on 1st January, 1947, to the gradual release of the Bevin boystaken into the industry, and to the Five-Day Week Agreement (which becameoperative in May 1947, but which was modified so far,as actual working time was concerned by the subsequent agreement of November 1947 on the extension ofworking hours). The introduction in July 1948 of the National Health Service,the National Insurance Schemes, and the Colliery Workers&apos; Supplementary scheme has also to be taken into consideration.Composition of the Figures of Involuntary Absence7. The next problem was to analyse the composition of the involuntary absenteeism figures with a view to identifying the particular components which had resulted in the increased total. The main components are sickness absence andabsence due to injuries. Accidents in coalmining have always been responsiblefor a large proportion of involuntary absence, and the trend in injuries absencemight be different from the trend of absence due to sickness and other causes.Moreover, the recent National Insurance Acts make very different provisions for ordinary sickness and for industrial accident or disease. If we were to assess theeffect of these Schemes on involuntary absenteeism we should have to split thefigures between industrial accidents and ordinary sickness. There are no separatesickness figures for the coal industry. On the other hand, all collieries are requiredto keep a record of accidents and to render each year a return to the Ministry of fuel and Power showing, for all accidents involving absence from work for morethan three days, the cause, place of work, the nature of injury and the duration ofabsence. With these figures it was possible to determine with reasonable accuracythe number of shifts lost as a result of injuryO. For the years 1935 to 1938 and again for 1945, 1946 and 1947 we have used national statistics based on thesereturns. For 1948 the national tabulation was not complete and two sampleanalyses were made, each covering 100 mines; one of these samples was alsoextended to cover the first half of 1949. In addition, we had available from theend of 1948 the total sums paid for injury benefits under the SupplementaryInjuries Scheme, and since payments are made at a flat rate of  1 a week it waspossible, with these figures, to estimate the number of shifts lost as a result ofinjuryf). Table I and Chart B show the movement of the injury component ofinvoluntary absenteeism. The difference between the total number of shifts in-voluntarily lost and the shifts lost through injury represent shifts lost on accountof sickness together with a small and fairly constant element representing shiftslost from other causesC). The movement of this difference, which is shown in thelast column.of Table I, may be regarded as sufficiently close to the movement ofthe figures of sickness absenteeism to enable any unusual trend in sickness absenceto be detected. While the results arrived at in this way must contain some margin of error, we do not think it is enough to affect our argument.Changes in Injury Absenteeism8. Table I demonstrates that, so far as injury absence is concerned, the upward trend manifested itself in the third quarter of 1948. It also points clearlyto the rather unexpected conclusion that the recent upward trend in involuntaryabsence must be almost entirely due to absences recorded as arising from industrial injuries and not to any significant extent to those recorded as arising from sicknessor other causes. Injury absences have increased from 1 - 8 per cent, of possibleshifts in the first half of 1948 to 3-0 per cent, in the first quarter of 1949.This increase of 65 per cent, in absence through injury was made up, in roughlyequal proportions, of an increase in the number of absences and an increase in their(2) Excluding injuries involving absence of 3 days or less.(3) Trade Union ativities; compassionate leave; and injuries involving absences of 3 days or less.
average duration. By comparison the average figure of injury absence in 1935 to1938 was 1 - 4 per cent.9. Some increase in absence arising from industrial injuries is, in itself, not surprising. Although the National Insurance Acts made considerable improve-ments in rates of sickness benefit, the changes in compensation for industrial injuries were more far-reaching and, if recent changes in benefits were affectinginvoluntary absenteeism, it was in the field of industrial injuries that they were most likely to make themselves felt. It was only to be expected that the intro-duction of the special Supplementary Scheme for the coalmining industry would reinforce any such tendency. We have found no reasons for thinking that theamount of absence recorded as due to sickness among miners differs materiallyfrom corresponding absence among other parts of the community, though there is some evidence that absences which would formerly have been classified as sicknessare now classified as due to accidents for example, lumbago has become a&quot; strained back.&quot; On the other hand, absence due to injuries is not only consider-ably higher among miners than in other industries that is a natural consequence ofthe greater risks in mining but since 1948 it has been increasing at a much greaterrate. Figures of monthly expenditure on injury benefit provided by the Ministryof National Insurance show that since the end of 1948 the amount of benefit paid out to coal miners has been rising far more rapidly than the amounts paid out to workers in other industries.10. A further feature of the figures was the high proportion of absenteeismattributable to injuries involving absences of five weeks or more (see Tables II and of the Appendix). Even in 1935 to 1938, when total injury absenteeism was only  -4 per cent., about three-fifths was accounted for by such absences. By the first quarter for 1949 when total injury absenteeism had more than doubled to 3-0 percent., the proportion attributable to longer term absences had not fallen, as mighthave been expected, but had in fact risen slightly.11. A further type of statistical test was provided by a special analysis of accidents at a sample group of collieries, showing nature of injuries and duration of absence for the fourth quarter of 1948 compared with the first half of the year(see Table IV of the Appendix). The conclusion emerges clearly from this tablethat, in spite of the large element of absences in excess of five weeks, the majorsource of increased injury absence has been the generally minor classes of injuriesdescribed in the statutory returns as strains, sprains, bruises, cuts and wounds, whileabsence from the inherently more serious type of injury such as fractures has not increased.12. We have also examined the incidence over the last few years of theaccidents which because of their seriousness have to be reported to His Majesty&apos;sInspector of Mines at the time of their occurrence. Since 1945 the number of theseaccidents has been falling and in 1949 was the lowest for twenty years. We thinkthat this confirms the definite view of the Inspectorate that standards of safety havenot deteriorated, notwithstanding the increase in the total number of reportedaccidents involving absence of more than three days.Recorded Injury Absence and Claims for Benefit13. We thought it desirable to consider whether the increase in the injuryabsence recorded at the collieries was accompanied by a corresponding increase inclaims for benefit, or whether it was due in part to the inclusion in the recordedfigures of uncertificated injuries or of absence which might more properly beregarded as voluntary. We compared the absence records in a sample of pits in1948 with *he corresponding claims to injury benefit and found that a differencedid exist - recorded injuries absence exceeded absence covered by medical certificatessubmitted to the Ministry of National Insurance by about one-tenth In the caseof the 1949 figures of injuries absence shown in Table I we have relied on estimatesderived from payments under the Supplementary Injuries Scheme, and these figurestherefore relate to absence covered by medical certificates. Though this does not mean that the colliery records of injury absence in 1949 may not still include someuncertificated absence it does imply that the recent rise in injuries absence shownin Table I cannot be attributed to this factor.
Occupation of Miners Injured14. The relation between the normal earnings of different categories of mine-workers and the amount an injured man can get from injury benefits and other sources (see Table VI) is of importance if it was the new benefit rates which wereaffecting absenteeism. Our sample enquiries have shown that between the first halfof 1948 and the fourth quarter of 1948 the number of injuries reported by faceworkers, who draw the highest rates of pay, increased by 13 per cent.; thosereported by workers elsewhere underground, who draw intermediate ratesof pay, increased by 25 per cent.; and those reported by surface workers,who draw the lowest rates of pay, increased by 44 per cent. In absolute terms, injuries to surface workers are relatively few in number and accounted for only about 20 per cent, of the total increase in the number of accidents reported.Injuries to face workers accounted for 45 per cent, of the total increase, and injuriesto other underground workers for 35 per cent, of the increase; thus underground workers as a whole (who represent 75 per cent, of mine workers) accounted for80 per cent of the total increase in number of accidents in the period mentioned.15. The situation revealed by the preceding paragraphs is, however, more complex than appears at first sight. There is, for example evidence that while thegeneral trend in the number and duration of injuries is quite clear, the position atindividual colleries differs very widely (see Table V of the Appendix). It will beseen that, while the amount of injury absence has increased very greatly at somepits, it has decreased at others.Summary of Principal Conclusions from Statistical Data16. The problem which was remitted to us appeared, from the data set out above, to be taking shape. Total involuntary absence began to move upwardssometime during the second or third quarter of 1948, after a steady fall from 1945to 1947. So far as absence due to industrial injuries was concerned, the upward trend manifested itself in the third quarter of 1948, and the rise continued through-out the first half of 1949 with some indication that it was flattening out by theend of 1949. This rise could not be associated with any deterioration in the standards of safety in the mines, nor had it any counterpart in other industries.Both the number of accidents and the average duration of injury absence had increased since about the first half of 1948. The doubling of injuries absencebetween pre-war years and 1949 had not been accompanied, as might have been expected, by any reduction in the proportion of absence attributable to the longer term cases. Underground workers accounted for about 80 per cent, of the increasein number of accidents, though proportionately there had been a larger increaseamong surface workers. The amount of injury absence varied greatly from pit topit. The trend of absence due to ordinary sickness among miners did not differmaterially from the corresponding trend in industry generally.Relations between Genuine Injuries Absence and Absence Recorded as Involuntary17. How far this state of affairs calls for &quot;&apos; remedies &quot; depends largely on theview taken of what would be a reasonable level of absence due to industrial injuries under conditions as they now are. Though accident rates have varied from year to year, they have always been high in the mining industry and are likely tocontinue so for some time notwithstanding the efforts which are being made toreduce accidents. Most injury absence is perfectly genuine and arises out of an accident and the treatment of the resulting injury. Genuine absence of this kindwill increase if accidents increase or if treatment takes longer than it used to do.The number of &quot; serious &quot; accidents has declined since 1947 despite a steadily increasing output of deep-mined coal. On the other hand, increasing efforts havebeen made in recent years to persuade miners to report the lesser injuries so thatthey may receive speedy treatment and thus prevent sepsis or other consequences of neglect. This has probably led to an increase in the number of accidentsrecorded in the colliery books, but the total number of days of absence arisingfrom injuries (irrespective of whether recorded as such) should have been reduced.In the long run early reporting will be all to the good and nothing should be done to discourage the practice.18. In so far as absence is genuinely due to injury it is beside the mark to speak of remedies, except by way of reducing accidents and speeding up the recovery of the men concerned. We are sure that the National Coal Board andthe National Union of Mineworkers are fully alive to the need to improve safety
and health in the mines, both by mechanical means and also by educating theminers themselves; and there is no need for us to make any positive recommenda-tion about it. The question of remedies only arises with regard to men who couldwork but stay away and succeed in taking advantage of the benefit and other arrangements to reduce their loss of earnings. These will include the man who&quot; invents &quot; an accident and reports it before absenting himself, and also the man who, having had a genuine accident, stays away longer than is strictly neces-sary. There is evidence that both these things are happening to some extent.Investigations at various pits have shown that absences reported as due to&quot; accidents &quot; are not always followed up by a claim to benefit and that, where a successful claim to benefit is made, the period of absence may exceed that vouchedby medical certificates for benefit purposes.19. A miner who is absent for reasons which are really voluntary may derivecertain advantages if he can get his absence recorded in the colliery books asinvoluntary. He would in the first place escape any disciplinary consequences ofhis absence. Further he may in certain areas continue to receive advantages suchas concessionary coal or rent allowance which would not be available to a voluntaryabsentee. Lastly under the Five-Day Week Agreement a proportionate bonus willbe paid in respect of a week in part of which he is absent, provided his absenceis recorded as due to industrial injury. There may therefore be a bias in favour of trying to get absence accepted at the colliery as involuntary, and as due to accidentrather than sickness, irrespective of any success the man may have in claimingbenefit from the Ministry of National Insurance. One factor in this situation isthat the colliery management seldom gets any medical evidence in support of theabsence and is not in a position to check whether or not the man is genuinelysick or injured. We recommend that steps should be taken to provide manage-ments with the means of controlling absences of this kind. We do not suggest theprovision of separate medical certificates apart from those used for benefit pur-poses, as this would impose extra work on the doctors. We recommend that theNational Coal Board and the Ministry of National Insurance should devise asuitable way of providing managements with evidence- of incapacity and its dura-tion, so as to enable colliery managements to identify cases of more than 3 days&apos;duration in which voluntary absence masquerades as involuntary. It would thenbe for the industry itself to decide whether any further action should be taken incases of this kind.Effect of Injury Benefits on Absenteeism20. We have considered whether the amount paid to a man who successfullyclaims industrial injury benefit, to which supplementary benefit is added under the colliery Workers&apos; Supplementary Scheme, is so large as, in itself, to amount to an inducement to the man to absent himself. In the case of a surface worker,irrespective of whether he is entitled to payments from a Friendly Society, the totalbenefits he can draw (together with any P.A.Y.E. refund) may not fall much short of the net amount he would earn if at work. (See Table VI of the Appendix.)We have drawn attention in paragraph 14 to the large increase in absenteeismamong surface workers since mid-1948. This may well reflect the substantialbenefits how available.21. As regards face workers the case is different. A face worker can earnmp to  10 a week or more; when on benefit he may get, at most  4. 8s. 6d. aweek, plus P.A.Y.E. refunds (if any). Obviously a man who can earn  10 aweek will not prefer injury absence to work for financial reasons, nor is he likelyto be decisively influenced by the fact that the Supplementary Scheme give himan extra  1 a week over and above the normal statutory benefits. On the otherhand, he will be better off during injury absence than he would formerly havebeen, and while in deciding whether to take time off he may rely mainly on theamount he will be able to earn when he returns to work, he may regard the benefitas something he may as well &quot; pick up &quot; if he can, particularly in view of itsincreased amount.Medical Arrangements22. We now turn to the question whether the changes in medical procedurehave influenced the figures of involuntary absenteeism. There has been no changein the medical arrangements for sickness benefit. What has happened is that thesystem of medical certification, which has been in use for years in relation to
sickness, has been extended to industrial injury. Under the Workmen&apos;s Compensa-tion Acts an injured man made a claim against his employers, who had the rightto have the man examined by a doctor the &quot;compo doctor &quot; employed by themspecifically for that purpose. This system, which has been criticised as oppressive,has been replaced by one under which a claim to injury benefit is established bya certificate of incapacity given by the man&apos;s own doctor and by a decision of theStatutory Authorities, taken after consulting the employers, that the incapacityis due to an industrial accident. Unless there is something suspicious about thecase (in which event further enquiries will be made) benefit for incapacity soestablished will be automatically paid so long as medical certificates continue tobe submitted. The man&apos;s relationship with the &quot; compo doctor,&quot; who was primarily responsible to the employer by whom the doctor was paid, was therefore different from his relationship with his own doctor, paid out of public funds, who, subjectto the rules governing certification, is solely concerned with the welfare of hispatient. Moreover, the employer may not feel the same interest in checking upon alleged accidents as when he was liable for compensation. In these circum-stances it would not be surprising if a more lenient view were taken of a man&apos;disability to work and of his entitlement to benefit than was formerly taken by the&quot; compo doctor &quot; in collaboration with the employer. It is, however, fairly clearthat, except in the coal industry, this more lenient view is not reflected in increasedbenefits paid out.23. Changes in medical custom and treatment might, of course, affect theposition. In recent years an increasing emphasis has been placed on the advisability-bility of consulting a doctor in the earliest stages of any disability. Enquiries madeamongst a number of doctors in mining areas have shown that this tendency hasincreased in mining communities. There was a clear impression that miners, andespecially the younger men, were attending their doctors more frequently for the lesser complaints, both sickness and injuries, and that this had led to an increasedincidence of absence on account of minor disabilities. Against this trend theremust be set the more rapid effects of many of the new methods of cure. Someof the doctors consulted instanced the good effect of penicillin in the treatment ofthe lesser injuries of hands and feet so common amongst miners.24. It has been very difficult to get direct evidence about what is happeningregarding medical certification in mining areas, but there is a strong impression that laxity exists at any rate in some localities. The extension of National insurance to industrial injuries has added considerably to the responsibilities of individualdoctors in a field which, in the past, has been notoriously controversial, and mayplace them in a very difficult position. It is not easy for a doctor faced with aman who complains of one of the less obvious disabilities, such as a strained back,to be sufficiently sure of himself and of his patient to tell the man that he is fit for work. Equally the doctor, may well feel some uncertainty as to the extentof a disability which certainly existed at one time. The more conscientious doctormust feel torn between his responsibility to his patient and his wider responsibilitiesas the certifying authority. It may be that doctors in the mining areas are in aposition of special difficulty and need support not only from local opinion butalso from the Ministries concerned.25. We are informed by the Ministry of National Insurance that they arebringing back into full operation the pre-war system of references of doubtfulcases to the Regional Medical Officers of the Ministry of Health for a secondopinion. The system was more or less suspended during the war and it has takensome time to build up again. Before the war questions affecting a person&apos;sentitlement to Workmen&apos;s Compensation were not dealt with by the RegionalMedical Officer, who was only concerned with questions of incapacity for work under the National Health Insurance Act. Industrial injury cases are now beingreferred to them on an increasing scale and the results correspond broadly withthose found in sickness cases. They confirm the impression that some portionof the absence recorded as involuntary, and quite properly certified as suchinitially, is not in its later stages due to genuine incapacity; and that, so far as industrial injury is concerned, this feature is more marked in the mining industry than in industry generally. A steady development of the system of reference,with special attention to mining districts, should result an improvement and may do something to help doctors in those areas over their greater certification difficul-ties.  We also understand that the Ministry of National Insurance is rapidly
expanding the system of sick visiting, which was shown by Friendly Societyexperience in sickness cases to have had a very salutary effect in cases of unneces-sarily prolonged or repeated absence. We regard it as important that the protection afforded by the sick visitor system should be maintained at the highest level of efficiency.26. The enquiries, already mentioned, made among doctors practising in mining areas have suggested certain points which might well be considered bythe Departments concerned to ensure that any unnecessary delays in obtaining orcarrying out different kinds of treatment are eliminated. It has, for instance, beensuggested that the arrangements for physiotherapy and hospital treatment mightrepay special attention from this point of view. These enquiries also raise thequestion whether the position of the doctor ought not to be strengthened in rela-tion to patients who may press for certificates to which they are not entitled. Thisquestion is, we understand, already under consideration by the Health Depart-ments. It appears that the establishment of closer liaison between the doctors(many of whom would welcome it) and the local offices of the Ministry of national insurance might lead to good results.27. We considered whether the National Coal Board should be recommended to set up a supervising medical or sick visiting service of its own. We cannot regard this as desirable. Not only would it lead to the diversion of a good many doctors who might be better employed on more positive work, but it would also be liableto lead to conflict with the Ministry of National Insurance over claims to benefit.We are assured that the Ministry of National Insurance and the Ministry of Healthare alive to the need for strengthening the efficacy of medical certification and werecommend that all possible steps be taken by way of reference to the RegionalMedical Officers and sick visiting, particularly in the mining areas, to preventimproper advantage being taken of the National Insurance Schemes. We alsorecommend that the National Coal Board should consider whether anythingfurther can be done to verify, in cases of doubt, that alleged accidents have actuallytaken place before entering them in the colliery records and reporting on them tothe Ministry of National Insurance.28. There are wide variations in the accident experience at different collieries.To secure the most effective application of the safeguards available to the Ministryof National Insurance and Ministry of Health to combat abuses of the insurance schemes it seems to us worth while, at least for a trial period, to pay special attentionto the collieries which have recorded the greatest recent increase in injury absence.For this purpose the National Coal Board should be invited to notify to the appro-priate Ministry of National Insurance offices the names of those collieries.Conclusions29. We now come to our conclusions. It was to be expected that the substi-tution of a social service providing benefit for industrial accidents, in place of theold Workmen&apos;s Compensation system which had been carried on in an atmosphere of claim and counter-claim between contending parties, would lead to some relaxation-tion in strictness of control over both the origin and duration of claims. But forsome reason or another it seems to have led to a larger increase in.absence attributed to industrial injuries in the coal industry than elsewhere. The question is why thisshould be so?30. The only obvious distinguishing feature about the coal industry is thatinjury benefits are also provided by the Colliery Workers&apos; Supplementary Schemeand we do not doubt that the addition of these benefits contributed to the rise ininjury absence. The proportionately greater increase in absence among the surface workers might be held&quot;to suggest that the amount of the supplementary benefit is the major factor, but some of this increase may fairly be ascribed to justifiable injuryabsence which under the previous system the surface worker was unable to afford.On the face of it, it seems improbable that the extra  1 a week obtainable from the supplementary Scheme can have been sufficient in relation to the earnings normallybrought home, by the face workers in particular, to have affected so decisively the frequency and duration of injury absence. In any event any explanation which sought to attribute the increase wholly or mainly to the Scheme would completelydisregard the fact that by far the greatest part of the increased injury absence isattested by doctors&apos; certificates. So large an increase in certificated injury absencecould not be accounted for by any conceivable degree of wholesale malingering
nor by a financial incentive of this kind. In these circumstances it would be entirely premature to consider any change in the conditions of benefit under the colliery Workers&apos; Supplementary Scheme.31. Our analysis has shown that the increase in absence classified as &quot; involun-tary&quot; contains three elements. Part has full medical justification; part has nomedical justification, being simply absence wrongly classified as due to accident orsickness; and between these two lies the class of involuntary absence which isunreasonably prolonged, either by the doctor in certifying recovery, or by the manat the end of the certified period.32. In regard to the part which has full medical justification not much needs to be said. The incidence of injury in coal mining is far above what it is in anyother industry, the work is much more arduous than in the great majority of otherindustries, and the pressure for production has been severe. It would not thereforebe surprising if the substitution of doctors more concerned with their patients and less concerned with their employers than heretofore had led to a fully justifiedincrease in injury absence; this may have shown itself, in part, as a shift from whatused to be classed as voluntary absenteeism to involuntary absenteeism.33. As regards the part that has no medical justification, its existence is nodoubt attributable to the financial incentive and to the fact that in coal miningaccidents are comparatively so much more frequent than in other occupations thattheir use as an excuse for absence comes naturally to the mind of the miner whofeels an urge to take a holiday. It is small in extent but we have made a recom-mendation in paragraph 19 to deal with it.34. It is to the intermediate class unreasonably prolonged injury absence that our recommendations have mainly been directed. We have observed that the pattern of involuntary absence has varied strikingly between pit and pit since thenew schemes were introduced. These variations suggest that differences in conductare related to the attitudes to work prevalent at different pits rather than to anyattitude common to the industry as a whole. It is in relation to this factor in thesituation that we feel that a need is shown on the one hand for stricter control and discipline in the administration of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act,and on the other for a stronger morale in the pits, particularly in the &quot; bad &quot; pits.35. The sanctions behind the new service cannot, in the nature of the case,be as strong as those that used to operate when compensation was the responsibilityof the employers, but reference to the Regional Medical Officers and sick visitingcan do a lot to stop both deliberate cheating and the possibly more excusable failure to make the effort to return to work when the time comes. It is most important,especially in the early years of the Service when new social habits are being formed,that everything possible should be done to prevent it from being abused and this no less in the interest of national health than of economy and production. Theindustry, by building up discipline and morale, can also make a contribution towards the same end. For the industry, however, involuntary absence which iswrongly recorded as such or is unnecessarily prolonged is only one aspect of thegeneral problem of absenteeism. We have no doubt that steps which effectivelyimprove normal attendance are likely to reduce also the avoidable element ininvoluntary absenteeism.SummaryFactual36.-(i) The recent increase in involuntary absenteeism has not been due toany appreciable extent to an increase in sickness, but has been due almost entirely to increased absence resulting from industrial injuries. The percentage absenteeismaccounted for by injuries stood at 1 - 8 per cent, in 1947 and the first half of 1948,but in the third quarter of 1948 it rose steeply, the average level in 1949 being 3;1per cent. This rise now shows signs of flattening oif. A comparable increase ininjuries absence has not been experienced in other industries (paragraphs 8 and 9).(ii) The increase in injury absence is a consequence both of an increase in number of accidents and an increase in their average duration. The rise in injuriesabsence cannot be associated with any deterioration in standards of safety in the mines (paragraphs 8 and 12). ,.(iii) Underground workers accounted for the greater part of the increase inthe number of accidents, though proportionately there has been a greater increaseamong the lower paid surface workers (paragraph 14).
(iv) Though absenteeism due to - injuries has increased markedly for theindustry as a whole, the experience at different pits varied considerably. &apos; At many-pits injuries absence has actually fallen (paragraph 15).(v) Medical certificates submitted to the Ministry of National Insurance coverabout 90 per cent, of the injuries absence recorded at the pits (paragraphs 13 and 30).Conclusions(vi) Most injury absence is perfectly genuine. A part of the increase whichhas taken place may be due to justifiable absence which, under the Workmen&apos;compensation system, the lower paid workers were unable to afford. A further partof the increase may result from the changed method of certification of incapacitythe man&apos;s own doctor probably adopts a more lenient attitude under the national insurance Scheme than did the &quot; compo&quot; doctor, who was employed by the colliery, under the Workmen&apos;s Compensation system (paragraphs 17, 22, 30 and 32).(vii) As a precaution against lax certification, the Ministry of national insurance are bringing back into full operation the system of referring doubtfulcases to Regional Medical Officers of the Ministry of Health for a second opinionon a man&apos;s incapacity, both for sickness and injury cases. The Ministry of national insurance is also extending the system of sick visiting. Both these measures maybe expected to reduce any unnecessary prolongation of certified absence. Inextending these measures, the Ministry might pay particular attention to thosemining areas in which injury absenteeism has shown the largest increases (para-graphs 24, 25, 27 and 28).(viii) The Health Departments are already considering whether the positionof doctors needs to be strengthened in relation to patients who press for certificatesto which they are not entitled. The establishment of close liaison between doctors and local offices of the Ministry of National Insurance might lead to good results(paragraph 26).(ix) In order to control voluntary absenteeism masquerading as involuntary,the National Coal Board and the Ministry of National Insurance should devise a suitable way of providing colliery managements with medical evidence of in-capacity and its duration in the case of absences of 4 days or more. The CoaiBoard might also take further steps to verify, in cases of doubt, that allegedaccidents have actually occurred before reporting on them to the Ministry ofNational Insurance (paragraphs 13, 18, 19 and 27).(x) There can be no doubt that the benefits available under the national insurance (Industrial Injuries) Scheme and the Colliery Workers&apos; supplementary scheme, together with P.A.Y.E. refunds (if any), have played some part in theincrease in involuntary absenteeism. This applies particularly to surface workers for whom the differential between total benefits and net earnings at work may be small, but to a much smaller extent in the case of the face workers. The influence of benefits is, however, only one of several factors. It would be entirely premature to consider any change in the Supplementary Scheme (paragraphs 20, 21 and 30).(xi) A factor which is hardly less important in the field of involuntary absenteeism than in the field of voluntary absenteeism is the discipline of theminers and their attitude to their work. It is in terms of this factor that thevariations from pit to pit in the trends of involuntary absence may most probablybe explained. Every effort should be made to improve the morale of the miningcommunity, particularly at pits with poor attendance records (paragraphs 34and 35).37.

He has been indefatigable inobtaining the information necessary for our work; his statistical knowledge and ability have been of the highest value. We are greatly indebted to him for hisinvaluable help.We also desire to express our indebtedness for the statistical assistance givento us by Dr. G. H. Daniel of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, Mr. J. C. Hobbs ofthe Ministry of National Insurance, and Mr. P. Redfern of the Central StatisticalOffice.Signed on behalf of the committed. J.
