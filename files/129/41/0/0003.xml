(50) 38th Conclusions, Minute 5) theCabinet invited me to prepare a memorandum on the Commonwealth implications of the Schuman proposals.2. The whole nexus of our relations with European countries in recentyears-in the Brussels Treaty, O.E.E.C., the Council of Europe and, to some extent,the Atlantic Treaty Organisation has inevitably brought into question the UnitedKingdom&apos;s relation to the rest of the Commonwealth.3. In all the discussions aimed at bringing about closer unity of Europe, our policy has been governed by two factors:  (a) the need to play our full part and, indeed, to take the lead-in revivifyingEurope, while at the same time (b) not engaging ourselves in anything which was likely to do damage to our relationship with other Commonwealth countries.4. Our difficulties have been fully recognised by our partners in the Common-wealth, who have throughout realised that we have a role to play in Europe andhave recognised that we ourselves have been scrupulous in bearing in mind theinterests of the Commonwealth as a whole. At the O.E.E.C. Council meeting inParfs on 1st November, 1949, the Chancellor of the Exchequer publicly stated our policy in the words &quot; We have made it clear from the beginning that our task wasto try to combine our responsibilities and interests as a leading member of theCommonwealth and of the sterling area with support for the development of unity inEurope. . . . Our position, therefore, is such that we could not &apos; integrate&apos; our economy into that of Europe in any manner that would prejudice the full dischargeof those other responsibilities that I have mentioned.&quot; The Chancellors statement was, of course, communicated at the time to all other Commonwealth Govern-ments, and the Australian Government, in particular, expressed their satisfactionat the line taken.5. Similarly, the whole question of our relationship with Europe was con-sidered at the Colombo Conference in January, and the meeting recorded theconclusion &quot; The representatives of the other Commonwealth Governmentsexpressed the view that there need be no inconsistency between the policy followedby the United Kingdom Government in relation to Western Europe and the main-tenance of the traditional links between the United Kingdom and the rest of theCommonwealth.&quot;6. There would therefore be no danger in going forward with increasinginternational co-operation with Europe. The other Members of the commonwealth would be likely to be disturbed by the setting up of a supra-national authority. If38961
the United Kingdom steel industry were placed under an Authority beyond thecontrol of the Government, this would give rise to the fear that the supply of steel and capital goods to Commonwealth countries might be jeopardised.- 7. Moreover, such a supra-national authority would suggest that we weremoving towards a European Federation that would fundamentally alter the &quot;UnitedKingdom&apos;s relation to the Commonwealth.8. It is fair to say, however that all Commonwealth countries would notnecessarily react alike (e.g., the Asian members of the Commonwealth would bemore concerned about capital goods than about political developments; Australiaand New Zealand would react more sharply against integration with Europe than would Canada and South Africa).9. On the other hand, it does not seem that the modified scheme recommended in the report by the committee of officials annexed to CP (50) 128 would be opento the same objections on the part of other Commonwealth countries. The reportrecommends that the authority should not be supra-national, with binding powers,but international, and with powers mainly advisory, though mandatory in certain limited and unobjectionable matters; the final responsibility would remain withthe member Governments. A scheme, broadly along these lines, would be seen as playing its part in the general effort to restore European economy without raising the fear of Britain&apos;s being ultimately swallowed up in the Continent and cuttingher ties with the Commonwealth.10. There are certain possible implications in relation to strategic interestsand to Imperial Preference which are dealt with in the report by the working party of officials annexed to CP. (50) 128 (see respectively, paragraph 101 and para-graphs 92 and 93 of that report). As regards strategic interests the proposal thatthe right to protect speciality production vital to defence should be reserved isclearly a welcome one from the Commonwealth point of view. As regardsImperial Preference there are, first, the preferences we enjoy in other Common-wealth countries: while we could forego these unilaterally, we should not wishto do so. Secondly, there are the preferences which we accord to imports, particu-larly those of pig-iron from India, of semi-finished steel from Australia and of semi-finished and finished steel from Canada (a table showing imports of ironand steel from members of the Commonwealth in 1949 is attached in Appendix A).We would not wish to withdraw the preference on these imports and could not do so without the concurrence of the other Commonwealth Governmentsconcerned.11. The Plan might affect United Kingdom companies who operate not onlyin the United Kingdom but also through subsidiaries of associated companies inother Commonwealth countries, e.g., in the case of steel, Stewart and Lloyds inIndia and Lysaghts in Australia.12. It is essential that we should keep other Commonwealth Govern-ments closely informed of all developments about the discussions ofthe Schuman proposals. They were informed by telegram of the negotia-tions leading up to the publication of the French and United Kingdomcommuniques of 3rd June and they are being kept currently in touchwith subsequent developments both through the Commonwealth liason committee and by telegram. Appendix B summarises comments received on24th June from United Kingdom High Commissioners on the attitude of Common-wealth Governments and Press. There have been no further significant reports since that date.13. To sum up, I think that the Commonwealth countries would look askanceat any departure from our present policy of combining our responsibilities as aMember of the Commonwealth with support for the development of european unity, and would probably react sharply to any &quot; integration &apos; of our economy into that of Europe in any manner which they regarded as prejudicing their vital interests. On the other hand, they have hitherto accorded a general welcome tothe steps we have so far taken to ensure a better balance in Europe and they wouldprobably welcome a scheme for the integration of Western European coal and steel industries, provided it contained adequate safeguards. Indeed, given this proviso,most other Commonwealth countries would be likely to regard United Kingdomassociation with such a scheme as a helpful contribution to stability and peace in western Europe.
Conclusion14. Subject, therefore, to the observations in paragraphs 12 and 13 above andto any views which other Commonwealth Governments may themselves express ata later stage, there is no objection from the Commonwealth point of view to participation by the United Kingdom in a plan for the integration of european coal and steel industries broadly on the lines recommended in CP.

G.-W.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. i,3rd July, 1950.APPENDIX ANote on Imports of Iron and Steel from Commonwealth countries the following figures show the tonnages and values of imports of iron and steel from Members Of th e Commonwealth for the calendar year, 1949.Exporting country	Pig iron		Semi-finished steel		Finished steel		Tons	 	Tons	 	Tons	 Australia Canada India...... New Zealand...

The tendency to criticise theUnited Kingdom attitude is diminishing, however, and the impression is gainingground that her original hesitations were justified. In Australia there have been no indications that the Government have given detailed consideration to the impli-cations of the plan, though Mr. Spender made a non-committal reference to it ina speech on foreign affairs on 8th June; general outside comment shows somedisappointment that United Kingdom Government were unable to participateeven with reservations. The South African Government press has also beencritical of the United Kingdom attitude and there is no perceptible appreciation of possible difficulties in respect of Commonwealth obligations. In New Zealand, onthe other hand, the press has in general supported the United Kingdom refusal totake part in discussions on the plan on the French terms.In India, Pakistan and Ceylon there has been no expression of Governmentopinion and the press has confined itself to factual reports.
