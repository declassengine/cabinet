9 9 his DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(50) 1971ST SEPTEMBER, 1950COPY NO.    wCABINETUNITED NATIONS ARMED FORCESPROPOSALS BY THE GOVERNMENT OF U.S.A.FOR STRENGTHENING THE UNITED nations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe United States is at present bringing forward various proposals in an effort to find ways of meeting future aggression promptly within the framework of the United Nations.    Two of these proposals concern the creationof United Nations armed forces.   The first proposal is for the General assembly at its forthcoming session to pass a resolution recommending that each member country should &quot;designate within its national armed forces a United Nationsunit or units, to be so trained and equipped as to be available for prompt service on behalf of the United Nations upon determination by the Security Council or recommendation by the General Assembly&quot;.    The full text of this proposal isattached at Annex.   The second suggestion is for the creation of a united nations Legion, composed probably of volunteers but possibly of nationalcontingents.2. The views of the Chiefs of Staff have been sought on this problem andare incorporated in the following recommendations.recommendations. For obvious political reasons we should not wish, if this can be avoided,to be regarded by the United States as acting as a brake on plans genuinelydesigned to strengthen the United Nations capacity for meeting aggression.   Itis therefore recommended that we should agree in principle to the first UnitedStates proposal subject to detailed clarification.   It is also recommended thatwe should inform the United States that we regard it as premature to approve the second proposal even in principle.United Nations Units4. The following may be said in favour of the first United States proposal: -(a)   The existence of units ear-marked for United Nations duty would reducethe awkward and even dangerous improvisations which the UnitedStates, the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and other powers have recently been called upon to make in the Korean emergency.This should be specially helpful in areas not covered by regionaldefence arrangements.

?j B 0(b) Knowledge of the existence of such units would be an addeddeterrent to aggressors.(c) A scheme of this kind would help certain countries, notably Canada,which otherwise find it difficult for domestic reasons to undertakeUnited Nations military commitments.   Canada is, in fact,adopting a comparable scheme to enable her to assist in Korea.(d) Such a proposal, although only a recommendation, should help to getthe smaller powers to shoulder an increased share in the burden ofdefence.   It should reduce the number of countries who, when askedfor help, use unpreparedness as an excuse for offering nothing, or at most an ambulance.   It could thus be a means of tapping extrasources of man-power.   It could also lead to the proper co-ordinationof non-military (i,e. economic, shipping, medical, etc.) contributions from those powers which were obviously unfitted to provide directmilitary aid.(e) Finally, allowance must be made for the fact that it is the UnitedStates, on whom we rely so heavily for the preservation of world peace, which is most eager for a &quot;United Nations cover&quot; for itsactions, i. e. for the co-operation of other nations in curbingaggression.   It feels this need both because of internal political considerations and because of external suspicions of Americanimperialism.   It is for this reason that the United States is not satisfied simply to rely on collective self-defence measures underArticle 51.5. When the Chiefs of Staff examined the proposal recently put forward bythe Secretary-General of the United Nations for the creation of &quot;small interimforces&quot; under Article 43 of the Charter, they came to the conclusion that &quot;fromthe military point of view there did not appear to be anything objectionable inthe proposal&quot;.   It would seem certain, however, that the Secretary-General&apos;proposal would be blocked by a Russian veto.   It is for this reason that the americans now propose that designated United Nations units should be set up byAssembly resolution, although this would only have the force of a recommendaticnto member States.6. Careful consideration must of course be given to the conditions underwhich these units might be used.    If they could only be employed under security council orders, they would probably never be employed as long as the soviet union remained a member of the United Nations, and the object of the scheme would be frustrated (except in so far as the implementation of Article 51 weremade easier by the existence of these units).   To obviate this the Americanspropose that the United Nations units might be employed by a vote of two-thirds of the General Assembly.7. Here certain problems emerge.    Would we find that British forces(i. e. &quot;United Nations units&quot;) would be committed to take part in actions towhich we were opposed?   A partial answer to this is, of course, that theAssembly can only recommend :   it cannot decide what member States shall do.Nor .could we be regarded as having an obligation to supply troops if we didnot vote in favour of the resolution recommending their use.    Our freedomof action would therefore btj retained.   Again, would the fact that a vote for an assembly resolution carried at least a moral obligation to supply &quot;united nations forces&quot; result in many countries hesitating to cast a positive vote?If this happened, the schfcme would produce precisely the opposite result fromthat which the Americans want.    It would weaken the United Nations cover even for the action which individual countries might be willing to take voluntarily.

(Against that, however, the Americans have intimated that they agree that action might still be taken under Article 51 even in the absence of a two-thirds majority in the Assembly).8. It is also recognised that formidable practical difficulties would haveto be faced.    The Chiefs of Staff emphasise that, because of our very smallstrategic reserves, it would be extremely difficult to maintain separate unitsready for the United Nations call and no other.    They consider, however, that itshould be possible, within the framework of the United States proposal, to finda solution which would be compatible with our regional defence commitments.They also stress the importance of ensuring that the Co-coordinator providedfor in the United States proposal shall be either a United States or United Kingdomnational.9. It seems certain that the Russians would refuse to co-operate in thisscheme, but it is not considered that its implementation would force them towithdraw from the United Nations.    They will doubtless allege that the proposalimpinges on the functions of the Military Staff Committee and of the security council under Articles 42 and 43.   The answer is that these Articles relate onlyto the military obligations of members.   This proposal, on the other hand, is a recommendation to enable members to take certain provisional action on behalfof the United Nations where such action is legally decided on or otherwise legallypermissible.United Nations Legion10. The proposal for a United Nations Legion composed of volunteers is not really an alternative to the previous suggestion.    It is at best supplementary.It is, of course, an idea with considerable public appeal and it is a fact that theUnited Nations has received several thousand applications for military servicesince the Korean fighting began.   It might conceivably provide a method forutilising German and Japanese man-power for defence purposes.   It might also be argued that such a force could be committed, at least to curb local conflicts,without necessarily involving national armies.    The Canadians have suggested thatsuch a Legion might also provide the man-power for the post-hostilitiesoccupation of Korea, thus freeing other national forces.U. The Chiefs of Staff do not, however, have much faith in the calibre of personnel likely to enlist in international volunteer organisations and theyconsider that the problems of security (e. g. communist infiltration), of command,of military discipline and of supply (even if the Americans, as sponsors of theidea, were to help with equipment and finance) would be very great.   As the americans admit that they are only now beginning to work on these problems, theChiefs of Staff consider it undesirable to pursue this idea further at the presenttime.E.B.Foreign Office, S. &quot;W, 1. ,1ST SEPTEMBER, 1950.
