[IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(50) 157 COPY NO.     ^2-3RD JULY, 1950CABINETCONTROL OF STRATEGIC EXPORTSTO CHINA AND NORTH KOREAMemorandum by the Minister of state in June, 1949, discussions were held in London between UnitedKingdom and United States officials regarding a proposal put forward bythe United States for the control of strategic exports to China and north korea.    As a result of these discussions a paper (S.A.C.(49) 9) was sub-mitted to the China and South-East Asia Committee of the Cabinet on 22ndJuly, 1949, recommending that His Majesty&apos;s Government should agree toimpose controls on the export to China and North Korea of a specified listof strategic items, subject to the co-operation in the scheme of the belgians, and also of the French and the Dutch, in respect of both theirmetropolitan and their Far Eastern colonial territories.     A further con-dition was that the United States Government should institute similarcontrols in respect of exports from Japan.     It was the intention that anycontrols instituted by the United Kingdom should also be imposed in HongKong and Singapore so as to prevent re-exports.    The China and South-East Asia Committee approved these recommendations on 22nd July,1949 (S.A.C.(49) 6th Meeting, Minute 1).2. The United States Government were informed of this decision.There followed protracted discussions with the United States regardingdetailed aspects of the control scheme, and the nature and content of the communication to be made to the French, Netherlands and belgian governments.     In the meantime, political events in Indo-China andIndonesia made a reference to French and Dutch Far Eastern colonial territories inappropriate.     In these circumstances, it was agreed that,while we should make every effort to secure participation in the proposed scheme by the Indonesian and Vietnam Governments, we should not bejustified in making our own participation contingent upon the co-operationof these two Governments.3. The United Kingdom and United States representatives in Paris,The Hague and Brussels, duly made parallel approaches to the French,Netherlands and Belgian Governments, requesting their co-operation inthe proposed scheme of export controls.     All three Governments repliedindicating their agreement in principle on the desirability of denyingstrategic goods and materials to China and North Korea,     The Nether-lands and Belgian Governments, however, expressed certain reservationsregarding the necessity of securing the co-operation of various otherGovernments concerned.4. His Majesty&apos;s Government have also approached other Common-wealth Governments with a view to enlisting their participation in theproposed scheme of controls.     So far, only three Commonwealth

Governments have replied.     The reply of the Indian Government wasnegative, that of the Pakistan Government entirely non-committal, whilethe Government of New Zealand have expressed their willingness toco-operate.5. In the light of events in Korea, the United States Governmenthave now urgently requested us to agree immediately to impose on exports to China and North Korea the same controls as we now operate in regard to exports to the Soviet Union and her European satellites,irrespective of the decisions of the other Governments concerned.     TheUnited States Government have made a similar urgent aoproach to theFrench, Netherlands and Belgian Governments.6. The importance of this issue at this particular moment is morepsychological than practical.     There is no flow of strategic goods fromthe United Kingdom to China and Korea, although it is believed thatlimited quantities have been re-exported through Hong Kong.    Neverthe-less, although there may be no urgent security reason for imposing controlsat once, the political and psychological consequences of our refusing toco-operate with the Americans on this subject in the present circumstances would clearly be very undesirable.     In view of the decision taken onS.A.C,(49) 9, the point for decision is whether we should still insist uponmaking the imposition of the desired controls in the United Kingdom,Singapore and Hong Kong contingent upon the imposition of similar controlsby the French, Dutch and Belgians, or whether we should agree to imposecontrols unconditionally.     Our own agreement to co-operate uncondition-ally on this subject would, of course, make it easier to secure the co-operation of other Governments.7. It has hitherto been the intention that any export controlsinstituted by His Jvlajesty&apos;s Government in regard to China should alsooperate in regard to exports to Formosa.     The security justification forthis decision was that it was believed that Formosa would inevitably,sooner or later, fall into Communist hands.     This consideration no longerapplies, and there seems no reason why Formosa should now be includedin the proposed control scheme.It is recommended -that His Majesty&apos;s Government should agree to instituteimmediately, in respect of exports to China and north korea, the same controls as are now operated in regardto exports to the Soviet Union and her European satellites;that His Majesty&apos;s Government should immediately, andirrespectively of whatever the French, Netherlands and belgian Governments may decide, arrange with the governors of Hong Kong and Singapore for theimposition of the same controls in those colonies.K.G.Y.Foreign Office, S.W.1,3RD JULY, 1950.8.(a)(b)
