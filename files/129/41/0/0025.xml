rTHIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GrOYERNMENT.Printed for the Cabinet.  July 1950CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 3f CP. (50) 175ISth July, 1950CABINET32nd SESSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL LABOUR conference memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service. In CP. (50) 63 dated 3rd April, 1950, I made proposals for action byHis Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to certain of the Conventions and Recom-mendations adopted by the 32nd Session of the International Labour Conferenceat Geneva in June 1949. This memorandum contains proposals for action inrespect of other Conventions and one Recommendation adopted at that Conference.The instruments concerned are three Maritime Conventions and a Convention and recommendation concerning Migration for Employment, as follows: Convention (No. 91) concerning Vacation Holidays with Pay for Seafarers(Revised 1949).Convention (No. 92) concerning Crew Accommodation on Board Ship(Revised 1949). : &quot;Convention (No. 93) concerning Wages, Hours of Work on Board ship and Manning (Revised 1949).Convention (No. 97) concerning Migration for Employment (Revised1949).Recommendation  (No.  86) concerning Migration for Employment(Revised 1949).The texts of these instruments, together with those of the other conventions and Recommendations adopted at the 32nd Session of the International LabourConference were circulated to the Cabinet in CP. (49) 182 dated 24th August, 1949,and were published in Cmd. 7852.The three Maritime Conventions (Nos. 91, 92 and 93) partially revised three off the Maritime Conventions (Nos. 72, 75 and 76) which were adopted at the 28th(Maritime) Session of the International Labour Conference (Seattle, 1946). Theproposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government in relation to the latter Conventions were set out in Cmd. 7273.Convention (No. 91) concerning Vacation Holidays with Pay for Seafarers(Revised 1949)2. This Convention deals solely with matters which in this country are settled by collective agreement, and the terms of the Convention provide for effect to begiven to its provisions by collective agreement. The earlier Convention (No. 72)could not be ratified because the annual leave agreements of the National MaritimeBoard are based on different principles from those adopted in the convention and in some respects do not comply with the provisions of the latter. The revisedprovisions adopted in Convention No. 91, which relate only to the inclusion of subsistence allowances in the amount of holiday remuneration, have not removedthe obstacles to ratification. It is not therefore possible to ratify this revisedConvention.Convention   (No.   92)   concerning  Crew   Accommodation   on   Board  Ship(Revised 1949)3.   The earlier Convention (No. 75) was not ratified because of one unaccept-able provision which required not more than four deck or engine room ratings tobe accommodated in a single sleeping room.  The objection was that in the larger39047 b
passenger ships it was in the interests of the seamen not to divide their accommoda-tion into such small compartments depriving many of them of natural light andventilation. The revised Convention No. 92 meets this objection and it is proposedto ratify it as soon as Regulations on crew accommodation embodying the require-ments of the Convention have been drafted. The Regulations will be made in due course by the Minister of Transport under powers conferred by Section 1 of theMerchant Shipping Act, 1948; their terms are at present under discussion betweenthe Minister of Transport and the National Maritime Board.Convention (No. 93) concerning Wages, Hours of Work on Board Ship andManning (Revised 1949)4. This Convention also deals solely with matters which are settled in thiscountry by collective agreement, and under the terms of the Convention effect maybe given to its provisions by collective agreement. The earlier Convention (No. 76)could not be ratified because the National Maritime Board agreements on thesematters, which have been framed to meet the particular circumstances of the BritishMercantile Marine, were in many respects at variance with provisions of theConvention. The revised provisions adopted in Convention No. 93 do not substantially affect these points of variance. It is not possible therefore to ratifythis revised Convention.Convention (No. 97) concerning Migration for Employment (Revised 1949).5. This Convention lays down certain principles and minimum standards for application to migrants for employment. These principles and standards relateto such matters as the maintenance of an adequate and free service to assistmigrants for employment and to supply them with accurate information, theprovision of facilities on departure, journey and reception, the provision of adequatemedical inspection and health services, equality of treatment in certain matters asbetween immigrants and the nationals of the country of immigration, repatriation,and the transfer by migrants of earnings and savings. The Convention consists ofa relatively short Convention proper dealing with general principles, together with three Annexes containing detailed provisions. Under Article 14 of the ConventionStates may ratify the Convention alone or with one or more of the Annexes byappending to the ratification a declaration excluding any or all of the Annexes fromthe ratification. A subsequent declaration may accept any or all of the Annexesnot previously included in the original ratification.The law and practice of the United Kingdom is in accord with the Conventionproper. As regards the Annexes Annex I contains a number of detailed provisions relating to the recruitment,placing and conditions of labour of migrants recruited otherwise than under Government-sponsored arrangements for group transfer. Thepresent law and practice of the United Kingdom, while generally in accord with the provisions of the Annex, does not meet the requirements ofArticle 3 (3) (b), which provides that private agencies may undertake theoperations of recruitment, introduction and placing of migrants &quot; if givenprior authorisation so to do by the competent authority of the territorywhere the said operations are to take place.&quot; In the United Kingdomthe conduct of such operations by private agencies is not subject to priorGovernment authorisation.Annex //contains provisions comparable with Annex I but relating to migrantsrecruited under Government-sponsored arrangements for group transfer.The law and practice of the United Kingdom is in accord with theprovisions of this Annex.Annex III lays down certain provisions relating to the exemption from customs duty of the personal effects, tools and equipment of migrants. They donot prescribe any qualification in respect of the period of ownership ofthe personal effects which are to be exempt from customs duty. In thiscountry the existing concession as regards customs duty on personal effectsdoes not extend to new or recently acquired goods, and for that reason theprovisions are not acceptable.In the light of these considerations I propose that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould ratify the Convention, but that they should append to their instrument of ratification a declaration excluding from the ratification Annexes I and III to theConvention.
Recommendation (No. 86) concerning Migration for Employment6. The Recommendation contains provisions on a number of miscellaneousquestions relating to migration for employment which supplement the provisionsof Convention No. 97. It also provides that in appropriate cases the provisions ofthe Convention and Recommendation should be supplemented by bilateral agree-ments, and that in concluding such agreements the terms of a Model Agreementannexed to the Recommendation should be taken into account.As regards the Recommendation, the law and practice in the United kingdom is in accord with its terms except in respect of paragraph 14, which provides that private agencies may only engage in the technical selection of migrants for employ-ment if they are given prior authorisation to do so by the competent authority. Inthe United Kingdom there is no provision for such prior authorisation. the model Agreement contains some points of difficulty and is in any case too detailedfor our requirements. As, however, we are not required to do more than to takethe Model Agreement into account in concluding bilateral agreements it does not constitute a barrier to the acceptance of the Recommendation. I therefore proposethat His Majesty&apos;s Government should accept the Recommendation with a reservation on paragraph 14.7. In the light of the above proposals I seek authority for the issue of a command paper in the terms of the draft annexed to this memorandum.G. A.

The proposals of His Majesty&apos;s Government in relation tothe latter Conventions were set out in Cmd. 7273.CONVENTION (No. 91) concerning VACATION HOLIDAYS with pay FOR SEAFARERS (Revised 1949)This Convention differs from the Convention (No. 72) concerning VacationHolidays with Pay for Seafarers (1946) by reason only of revised provisionscontained in Article 5 (2) relating to the inclusion of subsistence allowances in the amount of holiday remuneration.The National Maritime Board have reported that the obstacles to the ratification of Convention No. 72 which were stated in Cmd. 7273 and whichderive from differences between the principles forming the basis of theConvention on the one hand and the Annual Leave Agreements of theNational Maritime Board on the other have not been affected by theadoption of Convention No. 91. His Majesty&apos;s Government are accordinglynot in a position to ratify the revised Convention on the basis of the collective agreements now in force.CONVENTION (No. 92) concerning CREW ACCOMMODATION ONBOARD SHIP (Revised 1949)The amendments made to the text of the earlier Convention (No. 75)concerning Crew Accommodation on Board Ship (1946) meet the previousabjection to the ratification of this Convention which was explained in cmd. 7273. This objection related to the provision under which not morethan four deck or engine room ratings were permitted to be accomodated in a sleeping room.His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to ratify the revised Convention assoon as regulations on crew accommodation embodying the requirementsof the Convention have been drafted. The regulations will be made in due course by the Minister of Transport under the powers conferred bySection 1 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1948 ; their terms are at present under discussion between the Minister and the National Maritime Board.CONVENTION (No. 93) concerning WAGES, HOURS OF WORK ONBOARD SHIP AND MANNING (Revised 1949)Amendments of detail have been made to the earlier Convention (No. 76)concerning Wages, Hours of Work on Board Ship and Manning (1946)but the National Maritime Board report that the amendments do not substantially affect the matters on which the existing collective agreements were at variance with the terms of the earlier Convention. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are accordingly not in a position to ratify the revised Con-vention on the basis of the collective agreements now in force.
CONVENTION (No. 97) concerning MIGRATION FOR EMPLOYMENT(Revised 1949)The Convention lays down certain principles and minimum standardsfor application to migrants for employment. These principles and standardsrelate to such matters as the maintenance of an adequate and free service to assist migrants for employment and to supply them with accurate infor-mation, measures to facilitate departure, journey and reception, provisionof adequate medical inspection and health services, equality of treatment in certain matters as between immigrants and the-nationals of the country of immigration, repatriation, and the transfer by migrants of earnings andsavings. The Convention has three Annexes. Annex I contains a number,of detailed provisions relating to the recruitment, placing and conditionsof labour of migrants recruited otherwise than under Government sponsoredarrangements for group transfer. Annex II makes comparable provisions relating to migrants recruited under Government sponsored arrangementsfor group transfer. Annex III lays down certain provisions relating tothe exemption of the personal effects, tools and equipment of migrantsfrom customs duty. Article 14 (1) of the Convention provides that the ratification of the Convention may have appended to it a declarationexcluding from ratification any or all of the Annexes to the Convention.The law and practice in the United Kingdom conform to the provisionsof the Convention and Annex II to the Convention. As regards Annex Ithe law and practice in the United Kingdom while generally in accord with the Annex do not meet the requirements of Article 3 (3) (b) which provides that private agencies may only conduct the operations of recruit-ment, introduction and placing of migrants for employment if given priorauthorisation to do so by the competent authority of the territory concerned.Annex III is not acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government in that it doesnot prescribe any qualification in respect of the period of ownership ofthe personal effects, tools and equipment of migrants which are to be exempt from customs duty.His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore propose to ratify the Convention andto append to their instrument of ratification a declaration excludingAnnexes I and III of the Convention from the ratification.RECOMMENDATION (No. 86) concerning MIGRATION for employment (Revised 1949)The Recommendation contains provisions supplementary to those con-tained in Convention No. 97.
