DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY-OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETREGULAR RECRUITING AND RE-ENGAGEMENTS:PROPOSALS FOR INCREASED PAY, ETC.Memorandum by the Minister of defence i attach a memorandum which I had intended to circulate to theCabinet at the end of last week, setting out in some detail proposals forincreased pay and certain other measures directed to rectifying thecurrent and prospective deficiencies, which are very alarming, of regular personnel in the Forces.     These proposals, which have been produced after considerable study by Working Parties of my ministry and the Service Departments, were to have been discussed with theTreasury in the normal course.     The Korean emergency, and thegeneral worsening of the international situation, against the background of the defence debate in the House recently and the Prime Minister&apos;recent broadcast, have, however, meant that settlement of the question has become of much greater urgency.     The Prime Minister hasdirected that the question of increased emoluments for the Services mustif possible be discussed and settled in the very near future, and that anannouncement ought to be made well before 1st September.2, I and my Service colleagues have therefore discussed theproposals with the Minister of State for Economic Affairs.3. The Minister of State accepts that it is urgently necessary toincrease the regular content of the Forces.     He points out, however,that we have recently committed ourselves to spend a total of  3,400millions on defence in the three years beginning in 1951 and that while we have told the Americans that v/e rely on their assistance as to  550millions of this sum they may not be prepared to provide so much.Within the net  950 millions a year remaining the Chancellor allowedonly  30 millions for increased pay and additional personnel in theForces.     I have never accepted this figure.4. The increases in.pay proposed in the detailed memorandum are estimated to cost (on present strengths) some  35 millions a year, made up broadly as follows:-C.P.(50) 19010TH AUGUST, 1950CABINETMillions(a)Increases in pay proposed (on present strengths)(i) Other ranks    24(ii) Officers 7. 25 31.25(b)Flying pay. 8(c)Extension of re-engagement bounties0.8(d)2. 0 35. 0 millions

5. In addition, however, one must anticipate increases in strengthnext year resulting from the call-up of reservists, and from theretention in the Forces of time-expired regulars.     These are temporarymeasures undertaken, in relation to developments in Korea;   but in so faras they continue throughout the coming year, and also to the extent towhich the proposals for increased pay succeed in their object of attracting more regular recruits, the increased numbers involved maybe as much as 45,000 next year.     The cost of this number of men wouldbe  12 millions on present rates of pay or  15 millions on the proposed new rates.     This would have to be added to the  35 millions mentionedabove.6. The Minister of State for Economic Affairs has agreed thatthe proposal, put forward in my paper C.P,(50) 188, to extend the periodof national service to two years should be considered so far as the costat present rates of pay is concerned apart from the foregoing sums andas an addition to the  30 millions a year allowed for by the Chancellorfor increased pay and personnel.     This would involve  16 millions ayear.     If, however, my proposal to pay national service men the fullregular rates of pay for their final six months&apos; service is accepted, andif the present increases in pay are granted in full there would be another  5 millions to find in addition to the  35 millions plus  15millions mentioned above -  55 millions in all compared with theChancellor&apos;s  30 millions which, however, as I have said, I myselfnever accepted as the maximum.7. I am discussing these points further with my Service colleagues and the Minister of State, and we shall be able to report the outcome: tothe Cabinet orally.E.S.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1,10TH AUGUST, 1950.

ANNEXREGULAR RECRUITING AND RE-ENGAGEMENTS:PROPOSALS FOR INCREASED PAY ETC.1. The proposals to extend the period of National Service to two years and to stop, for a time, the release of time expired regularservicemen are expedients which are forced upon us by our immediateneeds.    Whatever may be decided about them there is a most urgent needfor a general and substantial increase in Service pay and for other measuresdirected to the stimulation of voluntary regular recruitment andre-engagement.2. The current downward trends in regular recruitment, extensions of service and re-engagements must be reversed if the efficiency of theforces is not to be seriously damaged for a long period.3. The present regular strength of the Army is about 183,000 men(including those on short service bounty engagements).   On presentrecruiting and re-engagement trends it will fall by about 40,000 in thenext three years or so.   Even to maintain the present strength the annual rate of recruitment must be increased to 30,000 compared with the present rate of about 18,000.   The aim, however, is to build up to at least 220,000regulars and more and this will necessitate an even higher recruitingfigure, combined with increased extensions and re-engagements.   At thesame time intakes must be improved in quality.   The Women&apos;s Royal army corps is also 4,000 short of its proper strength of 11,000 and the present level of recruiting is not high enough to maintain even the present strengthof 7,000.4. The present regular strength of the Air Force is some 125,000(including women and men on bounty engagements) and is expected toremain more or less steady for the next three years.    Within a totalforce of some 200,000, however, the proportion of regulars must be much higher   than this.    The Air Ministry&apos;s immediate aim is to raise theregular strength to at least 140,000 increasing to 160,000.   If this strength is to be reached within a reasonable time, the present rate of recruitmentmust be increased by at least 50%.,5. In the Navy regular recruitment is generally speaking satisfactorythough there is room for improvements in quality.    The Admiralty&apos;main problem, one of great seriousness for them, as indeed it is forthe other Services, is to improve the rate of re-engagement.    This questiondealt with separately later in this paper.6. I think it is now accepted that, in order to reverse these trends,increases in pay are required.   The questions for decision are the timing,the scope and the scale of such increases.7. As regards timing the matter is clearly of the highest urgency.Pay was a dominant theme in the recent defence debate and it is now generally assumed in spite of the guarded nature of Ministerial pronounce-ments in this debate, and from the Prime Minister&apos;s recent broadcast, that increases in pay are imminent.   It is politically impossible, I think, to contemplate extending the period of National Service without also making a real effort to secure a substantial increase in the regular content of theforces and thus offering some hopes of restoring to them a proper balance

9 ft of man-power and of an eventual reduction in the period of NationalService.   In any event, the Government cannot, in my view, claim that they are facing their national and international defence respon-sibilities unless they give an earnest of their intention resolutely to tackle the man-power situation.   General conditions of service - thearrangement of duties, uniform, accommodation and resettlement incivil life - are all of them important in this connection and are being examined but the most effective way of doing this (indeed without this any other measures would be largely ineffective) is to grantsubstantial increases in pay for regulars.    Both politically and from thepoint of view of the Services it is, I think, important that such increases should be announced in the Prime Minister&apos;s promised broadcast to theforces.8. As regards scope, increases in pay must, I think, be general.The man-power deficiencies of the forces are overall deficiencieseven though they are particularly acute, or particularly apparent,in special categories.   The forces do not, in general, aim to attractspecial categories of men.    Their primary aim is to attract men of agood physical and mental standard who can be trained, in the forces,for particular duties.    The forces pay codes provide for carefullyassessed relativities between the pay of tradesmen and other categorieswhich it would be both wrong and damaging unduly to disturbparticularly at a time when active service conditions exist, or may arise,in many theatres.    I do not, of course, preclude special increases for skilled men or for such categories as flying personnel but by and largeI am convinced that nothing short of a general increase in pay willadequately meet the situation.9. The scale of increases must, I think, be substantial if it is tohave any real effect;   the increases given in 1948, which cost  12-1 millions a year, certainly failed in theis objective.   The increases must moreoverbe accompanied by certain other measures, which I outline below,directed to particular difficulties and shortages,PAY INCREASES10. The question of pay has been under intensive examination forsome months.   In broad outline the proposals which have emerged andwhich are at present under detailed discussion with the Treasury, are asfollows:11.     Other Ranks.     The rates of pay for other r*nks, in all three Services,have been based, since 1946, on an equation between the emoluments ofa married man in a basic Service rank (three-star private) and the wagerate of a comparable civilian.    The equation makes some small allowance for the differences in their conditions of service.12. If we are to attract recruits, it appears to be essential that,for the future, Service rates of pay should(a) include a more adequate recognition of the disadvantages of Service life;(b) have regard to the very large and growing differences betweenwage rates and earnings in industry generally,(c) equate the emoluments of the single Service man (who gets a gooddeal less than the married one) with those of the comparablecivilian.

13. The conclusions which emerge from the application of these principles are broadly as follows:(a) There should be increases in pay of 3/- a day in the rank ofcorporal and below, including the recruit.   This would increasethe recruifs rate of pay from 4/- to 7/- a day and that of theprivate from an average of 6/6 to 9/6 a day.(b) There should be graduated scale of higher increases for senior N.C.O&apos;s and Warrant Officers (something like 4/6 to 6/-a day is contemplated here) in order to induce key men to stayon in the Services on reaching the end of their initial engagementsand adequately to reflect the responsibilities and status of non-commissioned rank.(c)   No increases in marriage allowance are proposed.   present rates of marriage allowance can be regarded as adequatelyreflecting the extra expenses arising from &quot;disturbance&quot; towhich the married Serviceman is subjected by comparison with the single man.14. The First Lord of the Admiralty, while fully in agreement that pay increases of this general order of magnitude are essential, is not at presentable to commit himself to the details of the scheme proposed.   TheAdmiralty are now working out certain changes in the structure of Navalpay, and until this work has been completed the First Lord naturallywishes to reserve his decision on the detailed application of pay increases tothe Royal Navy.15. A point to which he attaches special importance is to secure thatany new pay code for the Navy shall not reduce the ra.tio between the pay of junior ratings and that of senior ratings or of men with specialistqualifications:   the existing pay code has been the subject of much criticism from the Fleet during the whole of the time it has been in operation,on the ground that there is insufficient incentive in the way of pay increases to lead men to qualify for higher ratings or as senior specialists.    Therecommendations of the Admiralty Committee which has been examining the trade and career structure of the lower deck (which the Board are considering currently) envisage the introduction of differential ratesof pay for each rating (e. g. able seaman, leading seaman, petty officer, etc. )according to the qualifications he has secured.   Such differential rates would represent, generally speaking, additions to the increased basic ratesdescribed above in this paper but will be essential if a sound pay codeis to be framed that will not have to be reviewed within a short time.The sum of money involved in these structure changes is estimated to beabout   Ij millions a year.16. The War Office, who are reviewing the trade and career structure of the Army, are in a similar position.   When their review is completedthey, too, may have to propose limited further increases additional to the basic increases set out in paragraph 13.17.     Officers.    The factors on which the rates of pay of officers are atpresent based are necessarily less definite than in the case of other ranks.On the basis of a study of budgetary expenditure and taking into account thegeneral conditions and responsibilities of Service life, the need to maintainthe status of the officer and to enable him to discharge his duties, the heavy

-additional expenses involved in frequent movement and the present unsatisfactory recruiting position, increases in pay are suggested of4/6 a day for junior officers and of larger amounts, yet to be determined,for officers of higher rank.   As in the case of other ranks no increases in marriage allowances are proposed.18.     National Servicemen.    My colleagues will recall that when in 1948,regular other ranks were granted increases both in pay and marriageallowances the new rates were not granted to National Servicemen during their first year of service.   After that time (i. e. for their last six monthsof service) they were granted the higher (regular) rates of pay while continuing to draw the lower rates of marriage allowance.   At the same timeregular officers were granted increases in marriage allowance only;these increases were not granted to National Service officers.19. To grant the increases at present in contemplation to allNational Servicemen would involve great additional expense.   At the sametime increases of the order now proposed for regulars would greatly increase the disparity, at present small, between regular and NationalService rates of pay and this would be very difficult to defend whenNationalServicemen are taking part in active operations in Malaya, may at any time be involved in operations elsewhere and, if the proposalswhich I make elsewhere are approved, will be retained in the services for two years in the course of which they may be expected to become fully skilled and responsible Servicemen.   It is proposed, therefore, thatthe pay increases contemplated should be given to National Servicemen and officers after they have served eighteen months;   i. e. for the extra sixmonths which they are being required to serve.20.     Cost.   The cost of increases of the order proposed, based on present regular strengths, and assuming that three-quarters of the increases are, in accordance with accepted relativities, granted to theWomen&apos;s Forces, is of the order of  35/36 millions a year^ (including 4/5 millions for National Servicemen).FLYING PAY21. Both the Air Force and the Navy are experiencing acute difficultiesat present in finding men of the right quality to man their aircraft.In the Air Force the intake of flying personnel is inadequate numericallyand, what is far worse, the quality of the candidates coming forward ismuch too low.    Wastage during training for pilots and navigators isrunning at 45 to 50% - involving an enormous waste of training effort.The aim is to commission all pilots and navigators but it is impossible,in fact, to guarantee commissions at the Selection Board stage to morethan 15% of those accepted for training.   In the Navy less than half thenumber of permanent officers required are willing to specialisein aviation and less than one-third of the short-service officer entry needed being obtained.   At the same time technical developments in aviationimpose increasingly severe physical and mental standards on men accepted for aircrew duties.22. To remedy this state of affairs it is, I think, necessary, inaddition to any general pay increases, to provide substantial financialinducements to undertake flying duties.    These, it is proposed, should begiven in the form of &quot;flying pay&quot; (for the Air Force) or increases in existing rates of flying pay (for the Navy) of amounts varying with rankfrom 3/- to 9/- a day for all officers and men who are appointable for

9^9J. r4flying duties.     It is also proposed to increase the gratuity payable at theend of an eight year short service aircrew engagement from  700 to 1,500 in the case of officers, with a corresponding increase (not yetassessed) for other ranks.     There will have to be consequential increases for certain categories of Army personnel such as parachutists and gliderpilots.23. The cost of these proposals, which have been presented to theTreasury, is -(a) Pay:-   about  1,600,000 per annum commencing at once;(b) Officers Gratuities:-    450,000 per annum eventually.No expenditure will arise for several years.BOUNTIES FOR EXTENSIONS OF SERVICE AND RE-ENGAGEMENTS24. The Navy and the Air Force in particular also face over thenext two years a very substantial loss of highly trained men who willhave completed 12 years1 service (having joined in the years 1938/9) and very few of whom, on present showing, will re-engage for the further 10years necessary to qualify for a pension.     This is all the more seriousbecause, owing to the cessation of regular recruiting during the war, no men of similar experience are coming forward to replace them.     In theArmy the same problem occurs at an earlier stage of service;   there isa most serious deficiency in the numbers of men extending their service at the end of their original 5 year engagements.25. In conditions of full employment the attractions of civil life toservicemen around the age of 30, many of whom are married, by compari-son with a further 10 years of the risk, disturbance and separation whichare inseparable from life in the Services, are very strong and areaccentuated by the fact that a gratuity (at present  7 0) is payable to menwho leave the Forces after 12 years&apos; service.26. To offset these factors, we have recently proposed to theTreasury (a) as a temporary measure, the payment of a bounty of  100to men who re-engage (with a modification for the Army directed totheir particular problem of extensions after 5 years&apos; service), (b) theintroduction of a lump sum gratuity payable on discharge to pension.     I ampursuing (a) with the Chancellor.     I propose to defer (b) for considerationwith the general question of the Services retired pay and pensions codeswhich are being currently reviewed.     It will, in my view, be necessary tomake substantial improvement in this field if we are to attract the righttype of man to remain in the Forces for a long service career.27. The cost of the bounty proposals might be, in the immediatefuture, about  800,000 a year falling thereafter as fewer men become eligible.OTHER QUESTIONS28. The foregoing are immediate needs which can be met almost atonce.     In addition, however, further problems are being studied.29. I have already referred to the further limited range of increases which may emerge from current reviews of trade structure and careers;I have also mentioned the need for increases in the retired pay and

pensions codes.    In addition I should mention particularly the possiblere-introduction of certain forms of additional pay for Army officers.CONCLUSION30. The proposals for increased pay, for the introduction ofbounties to stimulate extensions of service and re-engagements andthose relating to flying pay have only recently been presented to theTreasury and are under discussion with them.     My purpose in submittingthem at this stage is to give my colleagues an outline of the measuresthought to be necessary to bring the manning position in the Forces intoreasonable relationship with present needs, to obtain a general endorse-ment of the scale of the measures contemplated and in particular tosuggest that in the matter of timing the formulation and announcement ofthese measures is of the highest urgency.    Accordingly I would suggestthat we should aim at a comprehensive announcement by 1st september and that officials of the Departments concerned should be so instructed.31. The measures in contemplation are of course expensive.     Itwould be idle to imagine that the present manpower deficiencies of theForces can be made good cheaply.     Indeed, the adoption of half measures would be dangerous and ineffective.     The measures we take now mustmatch, in scale and timing, the needs of the hour.E.S.Ministry of Defence, S,W,1,9TH AUGUST, 1950.
