C5  /1 3((THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (50) 1541ST JULY, 1950COPY NO.CABINETINTEGRATION OF WESTERN european coal AND STEEL INDUSTRIESDEFENCE IMPLICATIONSMemorandum by the Minister of defence at their meeting on 22nd June (CM.(50) 38th Conclusions,Minute 5) the Cabinet invited me to prepare a memorandum on the strategic implications of the Schuman proposals.2. As I understand it, the United Kingdom may be drawn into thediscussions now proceeding in Paris in two rather different ways:-(i)     At some stage of the Paris discussions some modified planmay emerge nearer to the United Kingdom standpoint.     Itwould then be necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto declare their attitude.(ii)     Alternatively, the discussions in Paris may get intodifficulties and it may become expedient for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to produce their own ideas.This paper deals with the defence considerations which shouldbe borne in mind by the Government in settling their policy in eitner ofthese eventualities.     It taxes account of the provisional views which theChiefs of Staff have already expressed on this subject;   of the references to the war potential aspect included in the report by the Committee of officials annexed to CP.(50) 128 of 20th June, and of further discussions in the Chiefs of Staff Committee.3. There are certain aspects of any scheme for closer integration of the coal and steel industries of Western Europe on the lines indicated by M. Schuman which are potentially favourable from the defence pointof view: -(i)     Any development which tends to increase the political andeconomic stability of Western Europe or to enhance itsprosperity is to be welcomed from the defence point ofview, both because of its direct contribution to the strengthof the West and for the reason stated at (iii) below.(ii)     Specifically, we should welcome any development which tends to favour an enduring improvement in Franco-Germanrelationships.     Two of the main problems which must be faced before the potential of Western Europe can beharnessed for the West are French fears regarding a

resurgence of German armed power;   and the determination of the safeguards which Germany must give for her futuregood behaviour.     The Schuman proposals may be helpfulhere.     A full and effective international control of the coal and steel industry of Western Europe might help to con-vince the French that they need no longer fear invasion byGermany.(iii)      There is a clear need for us to encourage any developmentserving to help Western Germany in due course to take herproper political and military place as an integral part of theWest.     The Chiefs of Staff feel that ultimately some formof German rearmament will be essential but they believethat the way must be paved for this by a large measure ofpolitical and economic integration in Western Europe.The Chiefs of Staff regard the French proposal as potentiallya useful step in this direction.     It is true of course that t.ieFrencn are still bitterly opposed to the rearmament ofGermany, and their official attitude is that the operation ofthe Schuman proposals would do nothing to alter their views.It is, therefore, the logic of events which would follow theintroduction of these proposals, rather than any indication of French thinking, which affords the grounds for thinking that a pooling of French and German coal and steel resourcesmight tend to bring nearer the day when some form of german rearmament might be politically practical.4. For all these reasons, should it be possible to found on the schuman proposals a generally beneficial plan for concerted inter-national action on economic grounds in regard to the coal and steel industries of Europe, the general effect (subject to what is said inparagraph 5 below) should be favourable from the defence point ofview.     Conversely, failure of the Western Powers to give any effectto the Schuman proposals will amount to a set-back in the &quot;cold war&quot;.5. The discussions in the Chiefs of Staff Committee and with the interested Departments have, however, brought out a number of points which we must keep in mind and satisfy ourselves on before becoming a party to any plan on the broad lines of the Schuman proposals:-(i)     M. Schuman in his original statement on 9th May said:-&quot;The pooling of coal and steel production should immediately provide for the setting up of commonfoundations for economic development as a first step in the federation of Europe, and will change the destinies of those regions which have long beendevoted to the manufacture of munitions of war, ofwhicii they have been the most constant victims&quot;.It is not easy to comment on this issue without getting drawn into the wider political considerations which flow from it.Broadly speaking, however, from the defence point of view the United Kingdom, owing to its special geographical position and world-wide responsibilities, should not commititself to any development which might limit our ability toco-operate fully with the rest of the Commonwealth and our allies outside Europe.

4 r15If the Authority were to have such supra-national powers asto enable it to act in a manner prejudicial to the defence programmes, whether individual or collective, of Governmentsconcerned, not only should we not wish to join it ourselves butwe might find it harmful from a defence point of view even ifconfined to continental countries.There might be a risk that, if the Schuman proposals weretranslated into fact, French interest would concentrate moreand more on the possibilities of co-operation on a Europeanbasis and less on developments under the North atlantic treaty.     It is accordingly important to ensure that thedevelopment of any measure of economic integration on thelines of the Schuman proposals should not be allowed todetract from the weight which we and our friends in western europe accord to our responsibilities under the north atlantic Treaty.The war potential aspect must be fully safeguarded.     Theiron and steel industries are vital to defence production;it is essential that they should be as strong, self-sufficientand as securely located as possible.     We could not subscribe to any plan under which the location or volume of these industries might be altered in a manner damaging to our security.     So far as special forms of steel are concerned,the working party of officials whose report is annexed toC.P.(50) 1Z8 added the following comment, with which theChiefs of Staff and I agree: -&quot;The United Kingdom has also a particular concern to see that no regrouping of the industry takes place as between the United Kingdom and the continental countries which would diminish its domestic self-sufficiency as regards special alloy steels and otherspeciality steel items essential to defence production.On this ground it would be necessary to suggest thatcertain specialised fields should receive protectionif required and be excepted from the general applica-tion to the area of the free trade principle.     Thegreater the community of policy on defence matters(e. g. through the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation)that is maintained between all or a majority of membersof the group, the less difficulty in practice is likelyto spring from this proviso&quot;.If United Kingdom participation in the Authority were to involvesuch a dilution of its power as to weaken the proposedFranco-German link, or to lead the french to believe thatthe Authority would fail to provide them with adequatesecurity against Germany, it might be better for us to havea special relationship with the Authority tnan to join itourselves.Whatever happens about our participation, it will be important to try to ensure that the Authority does not exercise powers in away which would cripnle German recovery in the interestof France.

(vii)     If the powers of the Authority were such that we could on political grounds consider joining it, full participationwould, other things being equal, give us a betteropportunity of ensuring that the Authority did not operate in a manner inimical to our strategic interests or inconsistent with the defence needs of the atlantic community.6. These points (as is inevitable at this stage) do not all pull inthe same direction.     They will, however, serve to illustrate the maindefence considerations involved.     I invite my colleagues to take note of them and to bear them in mind when reaching their final decision.E.S.Minis ry of Defence, S.W.1,1ST JULY, 1950.
