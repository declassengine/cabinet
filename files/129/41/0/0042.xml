THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY OF HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTY*S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1950SECRET Copy No. 3 2CP. (50) 19223rd August, 1950CABINETRELATIONS WITH SPAINMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs invite my colleagues to consider the question of our relations with Spain.It has to be considered under two heads. First, there is the United Nationsresolution of 1946 in regard to which a motion has been put down for the forth-coming Assembly, and, secondly, there is the general question of our future policy towards Spain. I ask my colleagues to consider the arguments set out, pro andcon, under these two heads, in order that we may discuss the matter at an early meeting.I. The United Nations resolution cof 19462.   In December 1946 the Assembly recommended:  (1) That the Franco Government be debarred from membership of international agencies in relationship with the United Nations, and from participation in conferences arranged by the United Nations or these agencies.(2) That if a government deriving its authority from the consent of the governedwas not established in Spain within a reasonable time, the security council should consider measures to be taken to remedy the situation.(3) That all members of the United Nations recall their Heads of Missionsfrom Madrid.3. At the same time the Assembly recorded its desire to secure the partici-pation of all peace-loving peoples, including the Spanish people, in the community of nations.4. His Majesty&apos;s Government supported this resolution largely in order to escape the danger of a more extreme motion, but they expressed a reservation aboutrecommendation (2) and always felt that recommendation (3) about Heads ofMissions was ill-judged.5. In May 1949, the Assembly rejected, by a show of hands, a Polish motion for stricter measures against Franco. A motion to give members freedom of actionin their diplomatic relations with Spain failed by a narrow margin to obtain thenecessary two-thirds majority.6. The recommendation in the 1946 resolution that Spain should be excludedfrom agencies under the United Nations has debarred her from such bodies as theInternational Telecommunications Union, the World Health Organisation, and theFood and Agricultural Organisation. The recommendation about the withdrawalof Heads of Missions has been honoured in the breach rather than in the observance,in as much as, of the members of the United Nations now represented in Madrid, atleast half have Ambassadors or Ministers.7. When this question was last voted in the Assembly in 1949 both the UnitedKingdom and the United States abstained. The United States Secretary of state has since announced, in January last, that the United States Government are now prepared to vote for a resolution which will leave members free to send an Ambas-39238 b
ambassador to Spain, and that they would favour the amendment of the 1946 resolution to permit specialised agencies to admit Spain if the agency felt that her membership would contribute to its working.8. The question of relations with Spain has now been put on the agenda of theAssembly. There can be no question of our agreeing to any Soviet bloc proposalfor severer measures against Franco, but we must decide our attitude on thequestions of Heads of Missions and admission to specialised agencies. Our attitudehas hitherto been to abstain from voting on the questions of the return of Heads ofMissions to Madrid and of Spain&apos;s admission to specialised agencies. The alter-natives are to continue this attitude or to vote for an amendment of the 1946resolution in favour of Spain.9. So far as the return of Heads of Missions is concerned, there is no doubtthat a vote in favour of Spain would be interpreted both in Spain and elsewhere asacquiescence in the continuation of the Franco regime, if not approval of it, andwould correspondingly encourage Franco and discourage his opponents. It is tobe expected that representatives of the Spanish socialists outside Spain and mostif not all socialist parties in Europe, in addition to the Trades Union Congress andthe American Federation of Labour (A.F.L.) and the Congress of industrial organisations (C.I.O.), will take the view that it would be a mistake to sendAmbassadors back to Madrid. If this is the case, a vote for Spain would rousestrong opposition in these circles.10. But to vote that Governments should be free to appoint Ambassadors in madrid does not imply any new recognition of Franco: we have recognised Francosince 1939. As the Parliamentary Under-Secretary stated in the House of commons on 2nd February, 1949, there are practical advantages for us in having an Ambas-ambassador in Madrid. By limiting our representation to a Charge dAffaires we precludeourselves from appointing a senior representative who could, if necessary, havedirect contact with Franco. In our own interests we ought to be in a position tosend the best man we can to represent our interests in Madrid. Furthermore, the leader of the Committee of Co-ordination of the opposition parties within Spainhas informed His Majesty&apos;s Embassy that in their view the 1946 decision has donemore harm than good, and that the return of Ambassadors would not be unwelcome to them.11. It is to be expected that this year, and particularly after the decision of theUnited States Government, there will be a two-thirds majority in favour of thereturn of Heads of Missions to Madrid. If this happens, and other countries thensend back Ambassadors, it will be necessary for the proper protection of our interests that we should do the same. If our Ambassador is to have any influenceor even to be accepted at all, it will be better that we should have voted for the motion rather than have abstained. If it is agreed that the withdrawal of ambassadors was a mistake from the start, we should have the courage of ourconvictions and vote openly for any resolution for their return.12. As for the admission of Spain to the specialised agencies, it is a fact thatSpain already complies with international agreements on such matters as shipping and aviation. There may therefore be little concrete advantage.to be obtained inreturn for the encouragement to Franco, which Spain&apos;s admission to the agencieswould give. On the other hand, in the world of to-day it is difficult to justify the exclusion of a government, on the grounds that it is politically anathema to us,from technical international organisations and agreements which aim, for example,at ensuring uniformity of regulations for the safety of passengers at sea or atspreading the knowledge of agricultural science or at preventing disease.13. If it were decided that His Majesty&apos;s Government should modify theirattitude in this matter, our delegation might be instructed to cast their vote infavour of any motion authorising the various agencies in question to admit Spainif they felt that her membership would contribute to their working. This wouldbe in line with American ideas on this point.II. Our general policy towards Spain14.   Another question that may come up during my talks in New York is themore difficult one whether the Western Powers should make any change in theirpolicy towards Spain.
Om present policyvt* 15. Our policy for the last five years has been to ostracise Franco, so far as our essential economic interests permitted, in the hope that he would remove himself, orbe removed, from power. This policy has not succeeded. The Allies&apos; treatment of spain in recent years has in consequence served rather to strengthen than to weaken the dictator^ position. It has not succeeded because-and this is clear to Franco we are not prepared to take measures to upset him which would hurt us; because we have made it clear that, while prepared to do business with him at the trades-men^s entrance, we won&apos;t have him into the house; and because by our attacks against his regime we have enabled him to pose as the protector of Spain against aring of hostile democracies. Franco&apos;s position is, of course, brittle as well as strong.The enonomic position is badly run down and, lacking credits, Spain can make onlya slow recovery. But the fact is that the regime has survived all its difficulties, andso long as Franco retains his health and enjoys the support of the Army, the Churchand the Falange, there is little likelihood of a change taking place unless Francohimself wishes it. And Franco will certainly not liberalise his Government unless he believes that it will pay him and that he can safely do so.Arguments for a change, of policy16. &apos; According to this view it is asserted that the present policy towards Spainis detrimental both to our own long-term interests and to those of Westernconsolidation.17. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned both the Spaniards and wehave striven to keep politics and trade in separate compartments. The result is thata.considerable trade passes between the two countries to their mutual benefit. Inthe sphere of military equipment and information, however, we have imposed a banoil: exports to Spain and, if it continues, there is real danger that firms like VickersAritnslrong and Rolls Royce will lose for good the business in Spain which used to beso)pr0fitable. But it is in the political sphere that our interests are thought to suffermost. His Majesty&apos;s Government are consistently represented as bitterly hostile to spain itself and as the prime cause of that country&apos;s present difficulties. Franco&apos;spropaganda is.helped-by the fact that we are more rigid in applying our policy than some others and take care not to speak with more than one voice, and that generallya denunciatory one. In the long run, it is argued, this propaganda is bound to loseus the goodwill of the Spanish people, and it has long been held that the strategic interests of this country demand that Spain and the Spanish people be basicallyfriendly towards us.: 18. So far as the consolidation of Western Europe is concerned, it is clear that,while the addition to the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation(O.E.E.C.) of an impoverished Spain would not immediately strengthen that organi-sation, the exclusion of Spain from participation in Western economic planningis detrimental to the recovery of Europe. Spanish production of potash, pyrites and food could be substantially increased if she enjoyed the same facilities as othercountries for obtaining fertilisers and transport equipment. The continuation of thepresent economic conditions in Spain is contrary to our policy of removing thebreeding grounds of communism, and there can be said to be a definite european economic interest in. finding a way out of the present impasse in Spain.19. In the military sphere there is a growing feeling that at a time when theWest is obviously threatened with a fight for existence against Russia, it is illogical,at the least, to exclude from the Western front a power whose regime, thoughdeplorable and even Fascist, is definitely not in the same category as that of theUnion of Soviet Socialist Republics. On a more practical plane, the Chiefs of staff have just been examining the problem of Spain in relation to the Atlantic Pact. Theydrew attention to the fact that the Spanish Army consists of 18 divisions of toughfighters. Their conclusion was that the military advantages of including Spain in theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) in the long term outweigh the dis-advantages. In the short term, they recognise the political reactions that Spain&apos;s membership might arouse in other Western countries, and appreciate that herinclusion might involve deflection of equipment at the expense of those othercountries The Minister of Defence has endorsed this conclusion and has suggestedthat a start should be made in shaping our policy towards the preparation of publicopinion in other member countries and in Spain itself for the eventual inclusion of spain in N.A.T.O.39238 b 2
20. In this connection one ought not to ignore the growing volume of voices inAmerica in favour of fortifying the Western front by the addition of a countryoccupying so important a geographical position as Spain. Nor ought one to ignore the fact that the whole-hearted participation of Portugal in the defence plans of theN.A.T.O. depends to a large extent on whether Spain becomes a member or not.21. Finally, there is the effect of our present policy on the Spanish people. Thepresent economic situation in Spain is partly due to the policy and mismanagementof the Spanish Government. There is however little doubt that it is the workingclasses, and particularly the peasants, who are suffering most from the present stateof affairs and that this state of affairs cannot be fully remedied without foreignfinancial aid such as might be more readily forthcoming if Spain were admitted intothe Western Club.22. In the light of these considerations it is argued that the Western Powers-particularly the United Kingdom, the United States and France ought now torecognise the need for facing realities in Spain and to change their policy. Ourpresent policy of seeking to get rid of Franco has not only not succeeded but is essentially misconceived. To seek the removal of Franco is, it is argued, to mistakethe means for the end. The object of our policy towards Spain should be to securethe liberalisation of the Government so that Spain may resume her proper placeamong the Western countries. The Allies have hitherto thought that this end couldbe attained by getting rid of Franco: they have failed to get rid of Franco and itcan now be seen that his removal alone would not suffice. What is required is tocreate the possibility of an alternative form of Government. At present neithermonarchists nor republicans are in a position to form a Government: the only realalternatives to Franco to-day are another military Government or chaos. however much Spaniards dislike the present regime, the vast majority of them prefer it to therisk of another civil war. This fear dominates their thoughts and many Spaniardsbelieve that the introduction of a more liberal regime, except under a strong leader,would open the door to disorder and possibly to civil war. Franco&apos;s Governmentwill therefore not be replaced by any better Government until the foundations fora more liberal regime have been laid. Since experience has shown that Franco willnot liberalise his regime while his position is under attack from abroad, our policy should be to seek to liberalise the regime in spite of Franco rather than to try to get rid of him.23. Those who advocate a change of policy recognise the serious politicaland ideological difficulties which lie in the way. But they doubt whether ideologicalconsiderations or ancient historical prejudice should be allowed to outweighgeographical and demographic considerations. They doubt whether Spanishco-operation need contaminate the principles for which the Western Powers stand.They question whether we should allow considerations which have not moved us when making friends with countries like Portugal and Turkey in the past to influenceour policy towards Spain. They draw attention to the efforts we are making toget Germany the country primarily responsible for our present troubles-on toour side. The cases of Spain and Germany to-day are recognised to be different,but none the less the contrast between our policy in Germany and our attitudetowards Franco is striking. Of Germany we seek to make a partner because we want her resources and her man-power to be on our side rather than on the other and because that is the best way to ensure that she will be democratic. But we also need Spanish man-power and co-operation and we want Spain to become more liberal. It is therefore argued that our interests demand that we should make thesame sort of effort towards Spain as we are making in Germany.24. If it is our object to bring Spain gradually back into. Europe, Franco&apos;interest and ours may be said to coincide in so far as Franco&apos;s desire is to enjoy the advantages, both economic and psychological, of membership of the WesternClub. But if Franco is to liberalise his regime, with all the risks that liberalisationin his view has, he must have some grounds for believing that the Western powers will cease to boycott him and to work for his downfall. Nor can we expect successif we adopt the crude tactics of saying that we will give him credits if he liberalises.But if, it is suggested, British and American Ambassadors return to Madrid andHis Majesty&apos;s Government and the United States Government are able to make their influence felt on Franco himself, it may be possible to persuade him of theneed, in the interests of Spain, of taking such steps towards the liberalisation of
the,&quot;regime as will gradually make possible a raising of the iron curtain betweenSpain and the Western democracies.  Such steps might be: -(i) Progressive abolition of the censorship.(ii) Progressive transfer of jurisdiction from military to civil courts.(iii) Enforcement of the article in the 1945 Charter for the Spaniardsguaranteeing security of the person.(iv) Re-establishment of the right of association.(v) Formation of one or two &quot; safe &quot; parties, to get away from the totalitarianprinciple.  ,(vi) Revision of the composition of the Cortes, so as to ensure better repre-sentation of the people.(vii) Reform of the syndicates.(viii) Increased religious freedom.25. It is not suggested, even by those who advocate this course, that FrancoSpain should at once be admitted to the Atlantic Pact or the Council of Europe.It is recognised that public opinion would find this difficult before Franco had shownreadiness to bring his Government more into line with Western ideals. It is also recognised that the programme indicated above represents only a modest step towards liberal government in Spain. But while in mediaeval times Spain had an extended system of local government, one result of centuries of misrule is thatSpain cannot now be expected, from one day to another, to adopt representative government on the models of Westminster or Washington. It is necessary thatSpaniards should be allowed to choose the form of government which is mostsuited to their character and history, and it would be a mistake to hurry them into accepting forms for which they themselves feel unready. Development mustbe gradual. What is proposed is that the return of Ambassadors to Madrid and the admission of Spain to the technical agencies of the United Nations should beregarded as the first step towards the return of Spain to civilised society. On one side these measures would be an indication that we no longer intend openly torevile Franco and to seek his overthrow. They would, it is hoped, convince Francothat the democracies are no longer out to smash his regime, and thus make it possible for him to introduce a programme of reforms which in turn would enablethe Western Governments gradually to raise the iron curtain and, as Spain becomesmore and more mixed up with the affairs of Western Europe, to use their influencegradually to secure such modifications in the regime as will eventually give theSpanish people the form of government and the place in Western society which theydeserve.Arguments against a Change of Policy.26. According to the opposite view it is claimed that the political objectionsto a change of policy are very strong and that these objections would be outweighedonly if it were clearly proved that our present policy entails serious practicaldisadvantages and that the proposed change would offer a good prospect of puttingthings right.27. The argument would run as follows: Franco&apos;s regime is a totalitarianregime. It was installed by the help of the Nazis and the Fascists. Its part inthe war was at the least equivocal. It governs by force rather than by consent.It employs a secret police. Its justice is applied through a system of military courts.There is no security of person and no proper right of association. There is no free trade union movement and no religious freedom. The Cortes is unrepresentative.There is a censorship and the administration is often corrupt. In short it is although there are things which can be marked up to its credit-a regime of whichwe should wish Spain to be rid and with which we should not wish to consort.But the fact that the regime is totalitarian is only one aspect. Numerous countries are largely totalitarian but do not arouse animosity comparable to that felt, againstFranco. The Franco regime is the last survivor of the Nazi-Fascist group of governments which instigated the last war. Not only that, but for a whole genera-tion of Liberals and Socialists in Western Europe and in Britain the Spanish warsymbolised the struggle between the forces of progress and reaction. Quite anumber of conservative-minded people also share these feelings and it would bea great mistake to under-estimate the dismay with which practically every memberof the European &quot; Left &quot; over the age of 30 would view any modification of policywhich appeared to involve the acceptance of Franco as an ally.
28. It is argued that this issue has real importance for the morale of western europe in the present circumstances. In the Labour movement in this country,for instance, while the intransigence of Soviet policy has driven everyone exceptfellow-travellers to form a common front in many international matters withRight-wing parties, there has been a great deal of heart-searching about the moral and ideological basis of British policy. It is unfortunately true that, while most of us have found it possible to unite against Soviet communism, it is far more difficult for us to agree on what are our positive aims. To accept the Franco regime merely because it, too, is anti-Communist would have a bad effect on Labour and Socialistmorale, both here and abroad.29. In December 1949 the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions(I.C.F.T.U.), at its inaugural meeting, framed a resolution opposing the grant ofany assistance to Spain until democracy and full trade union rights are restored,and opposing Spain&apos;s entry into the O.E.E.C. and the N.A.T.O. so long as thepresent regime continues. In March the General Secretary of the Trades UnionCongress drew my attention to the views expressed by the A.F.L. and C.I.O. (seeparagraph 9 above) and said that the T.U.C. supported the position adopted bythe I.C.F.T.U.30. It appears to be the case that our economic interests are suffering verylittle from the present state of our relations with Spain, and it is true that this is hardly a time when we need worry very much about retaining our markets forarmaments in that country. It is unlikely that Spain will in any case get armamentsfrom us for many years. As regards financial aid, the recent vote by the Senateof an additional $100 million for Spain would seem, if it is confirmed, to indicatethat Spain&apos;s absence from the Western Club is not a real obstacle to the provisionof loans from the only quarter from which loans of any value are likely to be forthcoming. Even the military arguments do not claim that there is any hurryabout the matter. It would clearly be wrong to send military equipment to Spainuntil we have equipped not only the Western Allies but also, perhaps, Pakistan, thecountries of the Middle East, including Israel, and indeed Western Germany.Considerations, both of geography and of probable efficiency, support this politicalbias, and the Chiefs of Staff themselves feel that it might have a depressing effect upon European morale if at this stage we were to show interest in defending Europebehind the Pyrenees.31. It is urged that, even if our present policy has not succeeded, it has not done harm and its continuation is not contrary to our own interests. A changeof policy, on the other hand, would not contribute to the cause of Western consoli-dation against Soviet communism, for it would weaken the ideological basis of ourfront and it is at least as dangerous to ignore these ideological considerations asit would be to base policy upon them alone.32. Finally, the conclusion is drawn, on this view, that the political effects of any change of policy towards Franco must be carefully weighed and account mustbe taken of the strong feelings which would be roused in the Labour Party, inthe Trade Unions and in the Co-operative movement and in Parliament itself byany change of policy towards Spain which was not accompanied by adequateguarantees that the Spanish regime would become truly democratic.33. I submit these contrasting arguments for the consideration of mycolleagues.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,23rd August, 1950.
