IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(50) 187 COPY NO.3&apos;2Z8TH JULY, 1950CABINETTHE CAPITAL INVESTMENT PROGRAMME:OUTSTANDING POINTSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in considering the memorandum by the Minister of Health(C. P. (50) 184) on investment in sewerage and sewage disposal works,the Cabinet should be aware of the present state of the capital investment programme in relation to our economic policy generally and also of certain other claims which have been put forward.The Necessity for Restricting Investment2, The total for investment in 1951 and 1952 laid down by theEconomic Policy Committee exceeds the programme carried out in1949 by  130 millions and  186 millions respectively.   These are very substantial increases and the Committee only agreed to them on theunderstanding that they were ceilings which could not be exceeded.The detailed forecasts of the national income, government expenditure,and the probable levels of savings, etc. (E.P, C.(50) 46), presented tothe Committee indicated indeed that private savings would have toincrease in 1951 and 1952 by 25 per cent over 1949 if savings were to besufficient to offset an investment programme of this size.    The decision as to the size of the investment programme was, therefore, based onoptimistic assumptions.   Even though industrial production in the current year has, in the first six months, run at a level higher than the forecastthis has been largely offset by a considerable worsening of the terms oftrade.   Moreover the increase in defence expenditure (including civil defence) which we have approved places a still heavier burden on theresources available for investment.   In the circumstances, it isessential that we should set our face against any increase in investmentabove the level already approved and indeed I must warn my colleagues that it will almost certainly be necessary before long to impose somereductions.3. It is always possible to put forward a case for an increasein a particular component part of the total investment programme in anappealing form. With very few exceptions, each part of the programme is a reduction of what the Department running the programme would liketo have and, indeed, thinks necessary, even on a restricted basis. In each individual case this may be a matter of a few million pounds but, taking all programmes together, these excluded but desirable items amount toas much as  80 millions.

4. If the total of the investment programme is not to be increased,alterations within it in favour of a particular programme can be made only at the expense of some other component programme.   It is the function of the Investment Programmes Committee to consider and recommend on the internal balance of the programme.   In doing so,they discuss each programme in detail with the Department concerned.The Production Committee accepted the official committee&apos;s findingsthough they had to make percentage cuts in some programmes in orderto make room for the increase in the housing programme which wasdecided upon by the Cabinet.   The programme for water and sewerage didnot bear such a percentage cut.    In my view, it is not desirable, evenif it were practicable, to re-open these decisions.The Water and Sewerage Investment programme. The amount allocated for water and sewerage in 1951 and 1952which the Minister of Health says is inadequate represents an increaseof  3. 5 millions between 1950 and 1951 and a further  5 millionsbetween 1951 and 1952.   These are considerable increases and mean that in 1952 the programme will be nearly double what it was in 1948.I see no reason why a programme which is already increasing atthis high rate should increase still further at the expense of other programmes, many of which have already borne a percentage cut inorder to accommodate the increase in the housing programme.Manufacturing Industry (New Building)6. As part of the cuts necessary to make room for additionalhousing, the Production Committee reduced the total for this programmefrom  80 millions in 1951 and  85 millions in 1952 proposed by the investment Programmes Committee to  73 millions and  75 millionsrespectively.   This was the same percentage reduction as was madein other parts of the programme.7. The Investment Programmes Committee then recommended a division of these totals between the different kinds of manufacturing industry.   These recommendations will be found in Columns 7 and 8of the appendix to this memorandum.   The Minister of Food considersthat a programme of  9. 5 millions for the food industries is insufficient.His estimate of what is necessary is  16 millions in 1951 and  19 millions in 1952, and he considers that a programme of  9. 5 millions is bothtoo severe a reduction on what is necessary and also disproportionatelyheavy in relation to the reduction made in the proposals of otherDepartments.   I understand that the Minister of Supply also has greatdifficulty in accepting his Ministry&apos;s allocation.8. While I appreciate the anxiety of the Minister of Food to carryout desirable investment in the interests of cleaner food and while do not dispute that substantial economies in costs and efficiencywould be forthcoming from a higher rate of investment in new building in the food industries, I do not consider that it would be right to allowthis at the expense of reducing the allocations of the Board of Tradeand Mlinistry of Supply, which are likely to contribute even more heavilyto higher productivity and a larger volume of exports.

9. For the reasons given in this paper, including the changed situation due to the decision to increase defence expenditure! I therefore ask my colleagues to endorse the decision of the Production Committeethat the programme for manufacturing industry should be  73millions and  75 millions in 1951 and 1952 and to confirm thedistribution within these totals recommended by the investment programmes Committee and shown in the appendix, Columns 7 and 8,and accordingly to reject the proposal put forward by the Minister ofHealth in CP. (50) 184.R.S.C.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1. ,28TH JULY, 1950.
