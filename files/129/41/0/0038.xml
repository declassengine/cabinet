9TH AUGUST, 1950CABINETSERVICE MAN-POWER REQUIREMENTSMemorandum bv the Minister of defence i have been giving urgent consideration, with my Servicecolleagues and the Chiefs of Staff, to the measures we might recommend the Government to adopt to meet the more urgent man-power needs ofthe Services&apos;Jin the present emergency.     To comply with the request ofthe United Nations and send contingents from the British Services totake part in the Korean fighting has imposed a serious strain on theRoyal Navy and the Army in particular.     We may very well be faced in the near future with commitments of a similar kind in other parts ofthe world, which we shall be quite unable to meet from the present man-power resources of the three Services.     Moreover, we must, in presentcircumstances, take some steps to put the three Services in a better position of readiness for war at an earlier date than we have hitherto contemplated.2. Very briefly, the position of the three Services as regardsregular man-power is as follows (the following figures exclude officersand women) :-(i)   Royal Navy.     A year ago, the Royal Navy began to reduce itsVote A strength drastically for financial reasons.     The choicelay before the Admiralty either of manning an effective peace-time Fleet by concentrating in effect on an all-regular Navy, orof weakening that Fleet considerably by dilution with nationalservice intakes proportionate to those of the other two Services.The Admiralty chose the former alternative, accepting the corollary that the Navy would lose the ability to build up rapidlyits reserves for manning the war-time Fleet through cutting downits national service intake to a token figure.The Navy has enough regulars, supplemented by its continuingsmall national service component, to man its Fleet on a peace-time basis;  but it is seriously short of the more experiencedratings, including technicians and specialists.      In particular, theNavy must somehow or other manage to increase the percentageof men who re-engage after their first twelve years period ofcolour service, a percentage which has fallen to 25 per cent fromthe pre-war figure of 60 per cent.(ii)  Army.    Army recruiting has fallen off very badly in the last twoyears, with consequent retardation of the planned build-up of theregular component:   in 1948, 25,400 men undertook normal regularengagements (excluding short-term bounty engagements);   in 1949the number had dropped to 18,400, and in the first six months ofHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(50) 188 COPY NO.

1950 the figure was 8,750.     Further, the Army is experiencinga heavy run-out through the termination of the short-serviceengagements initiated after the war;   and it is losing most of itsregulars after their first period of colour service, namely fiveyears, through inability to induce these men to extend to completetwelve years.    We must take steps to reverse this and I have had this question much in mind in the proposals which I am putting forward as regards pay.     The 5-12 year man forms the core ofthe experienced N.C.O. and tradesman groups who are so essentialto any Service, and on whom a large part of the burden of trainingfalls *     The Army is taking during the present financial year117,000 national service men;   the national service componentoutnumbers the regulars, and the result is seen in the serious shortage of senior N.C.O. s and skilled men.     The training of this large national service component imposes a heavy demand on the already overstrained regular force, while it produces nationalservice men who go to the reserve after their eighteen monthscolour service just when they are becoming fully useful to theArmy as trained men.(iii)    R.A. F.   The Air Force has also suffered from the serious falling off in regular recruiting in the past two years.     The figure for regular recruiting on normal engagements (excluding short-termbounty schemes) in 1949 was 10,300 only,as compared with 21,600 in1947;   and the proportion of regulars re-engaging for pension is far too low.     The Air Force is particularly a Service requiring a high proportion of skilled tradesmen:   many of its more highly-skilledtrades cannot be taught to national service men of only eighteen months   colour service.     It is at present some 20,000 short ofits peace establishment - a shortage which bears most heavily insome of the skilled key trades.     The aircrew position is alsoserious and there is almost a total lack of reserve flying personnel fitto take their place in operational units.     The R.A.F. is taking49,000 national service men in the present financial year, and its national service component is between 40 and 50 per cent of thewhole Force.     These shortages in the Air Force, and the lack ofthe necessary proportion of skilled men, has the direct resultthat a considerable proportion of its aircraft are unserviceable.3. This is the position with which we find ourselves faced to meetemergency demands for the provision of operational forces.     In order toprovide the British assistance to the United Nations forces in Korea,both the Navy and Army have had to retain time-expired regular personnel and to recall a proportion of regular reservists.     In the case of the Army,no less than one-half of the regular infantry reserve, representing one-fifth of the whole present strength of regular Army reservists, has beenrecalled, with serious effects on plans for any larger mobilisation into which all these reservists fit in their appointed posts.     If further con-contingents had to be provided similar to that for Korea, the whole regularArmy reserve might well be drained away in advance of any full mobilisa-tion.     And it must not be forgotten that the resources of the Army were already strained to provide reinforcements for Hong Kong and Malaya.4. I turn now to the suggested remedies.     In the opinion of theChiefs of Staff, the first and most urgent step required is the extension ofthe period of full-time national service in the Forces, at present 18 months,to two years, affecting all national service men now in the Forces and all future entrants.     This extension of the colour service would provide theForces during the next six months with 80,000 additional fully-trained men.

On the strength of the Navy it would have a comparatively minor effect,since the national service component of the Navy is already so small.The Army, however, would benefit greatly, in the following ways.     Theregular Army reserve need not be raided to the same extent for Koreanoperations;   the general efficiency of units would be greatly improvedthrough the retention of men who were trained soldiers, and this benefit would be particularly felt in the units in Germany and the Middle east which are largely composed of national service men;   further - and thisis a point of great importance in the present international situation - itwould afford the opportunity of starting to form an operational division in this country.     As regards the Air Force, the extension of nationalservice would go a long way towards meeting the existing shortage of20,000 men on the present establishment, and would help considerably to meet the additional numbers which the R.A.F. must have in theimmediate future in order to expand its front-line strength to undertake the necessary training of reserve crews, to begin organising a tactical air Force for Western Union, and to build up the Control and ReportingOrganisation.     The extension of national service will not, however,solve the urgent problem of increasing the regular content of the R,A,Fftincluding the skilled supervisory personnel required to make proper use of the national service men.     It will therefore be necessary for theR.A.F. to suspend the release of regulars, as the other Services havealready done.5. There is a further very important consideration.     My recenttalks with the French Defence Minister (at which other BeneluxMinisters were also present) have convinced me that while thesecountries will not, for cogent internal political reasons, take theinitiative in proposing to lengthen the terms of conscript service intheir own countries, they would respond at once to a lead from theUnited Kingdom.     It is most important that France, Belgium and holland should now keep their conscripts for a longer period of full-time service;   I see reason to hope that, while at present these countries have no more than 12 months   full-time service, a decision by the UnitedKingdom Government to increase the length of full-time national service to two years would quickly lead to these other Western European nationsadopting a similar term of service.6. I am well aware of the serious objections to extending the periodof full-time national service.     It means that 80,000 young men who wouldhave been available for industry will be held in the Forces.     But for themost part these will be young men who are of less value to industry thanolder men, and by this means the withdrawal of older reservists who are more valuable to industry can to some extent be avoided.     this measure would also bear hardly upon young men who are planning toenter the universities in the coming autumn, but it may be practicableeither to delay bringing the measure into force until, say, September,which would enable such men to be released for their courses at universities and technical colleges, or to make other special arrange-ments for them.     The Minister of Labour was present at my discussions of this problem with the Service Ministers and the Chiefs of Staff, andhaving regard to the labour force of this country, he does not regard the withholding, by extension of the period of national service and theretention of regulars due to be discharged, of about 100,000 men from industry as an unreasonable step to take in the present serious inter-national situation.

(j y *3l7. My Service colleagues and I feel no option but to accept the urgent advice of the Chiefs of Staff, and to recommend this step.     Itwill be unpopular in many quarters, and it will of course need thesanction of Parliament, since it involves alteration of the existing national Service Act.     But we think that the gravity of the present international position, and the serious deficiencies in our defences tomeet further emergencies - even short of full-scale war - in the nextyear or two has been brought home to this country by the recent defencedebate, by the Prime Minister&apos;s broadcast, and by the wide publicity allthese matters have received recently.     We think therefore that this is both the right thing to do, and that opinion in the country as a whole will accept it as such.8. In my paper (CP.(50) 190) I am proposing increases in pay for members of the regular Forces.     In my view a necessary corollary tothe extension from 18 months to two years in the period of full-timenational service must be the grant to national service men, during their last six months of service, of regular rates of pay.     After 18 monthsservice, the national service man is in general fully-trained;   in manycases he is a junior N.C.O. and himself an instructor.     He should there-fore be able appreciably to assist with training the additional numbers ofregulars whom we hope to enlist as a result of the proposed increases in pay, and whose early training will make yet a further demand on theregular forces.     But it is clear that in these circumstances the public will demand - and indeed in my view rightly - that the national serviceman should receive normal regular rates of pay during his extended sixmonths of service.9. Extension of the period of full-time national service to two years,while it will provide that immediate increase of trained strength of whichthe Services stand in urgent need, will not of itself provide the essentialbackbone of experience and skill which only well-trained regulars of long service and adequate numbers can supply.     It is therefore of thegreatest importance that measures should be taken, and taken quickly,to attract men in much larger numbers to normal regular engagements with the Forces.10. My Service colleagues and I are clear that the only effectiveprospect of rapidly reversing the downward trend in regular recruitingis by a major increase in the pay of the Forces.     As the Cabinet know,this subject has been under discussion for many months past, and proposals had recently taken shape for increases in the pay of officersand other ranks.     I am dealing with these proposals regarding Serviceemoluments in a separate paper.11. If the extension of full-time national service to two years haseffect from 1st October, 1950, the extra cost to Service Votes this financial year will be about  5 millions, and in a full year  20 millions,E.S.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1,9TH AUGUST, 1950.
